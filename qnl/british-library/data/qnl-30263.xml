It may be pointed out that the giving of this notice of intention is, of course, strictly in accordance with the terns of the contract of Cable and ireuess Limited. ^or this reason, it is hoped that the British Government will entertain no objection to the erection of a Taudl Arabian Government station at Dhahran for the establishment of direct radio communications between Gaudi Tabic and the United Gtetes.

(Vf 10249/1476/801) Sec/KKJ/W Cable snd Wireless Limited, Electro House, Victoria Embankment, London, W'.C.2. 19th December, 1944 Sir, With reference to the conversations with *r. Rodney Gallop and other officials at the Foreign Office on the subject of telegraphic communication with Saudi Arabia, we have reviewed the telegraph facilities existing at the eastern end of the Persian Gulf, particularly those at Bahrain and Dahran, There is no doubt that the relative situation of these two places is such that a much clearer and better telegraphic service with London and New York can be given by a station situated on the island of Bahrain than by a station on the mainlsnd at Dahran* We are therefore planning to erect a 10 K.w. transmitter with the necessary power plant, receivers, etc*, at our existing station at Bahrain which is already in communication with Aden, Muscat, Karachi and other places. This new station would be worked by our own operators and would be capable of giving a satisfactory service to London, New York end the other places we have mentioned* Another consideration which impels us to prefer a station at Bahrain is the fact that a station at Dahran operating only with New York would not in our opinion be likely to be satisfactory financially. The next point to be considered is the necessary link between Bahrain and Dahran as well as any other place on the mainland which may wish to common cate with the new station* Without knowing the volume and category of the traffic that will have to be handled it would be difficult at the present time to say what link would be provided, but we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to provide a satisfactory service. We shall be prepared to instal and operate a telegraph station at Dshran with the necessary wireless equipment for communication with Bahrain* If communication is required with other places on the mainland besides Dahran we shall be glad to receive some further information about it. We understood from the conversations that there are two other parties to be considered, that is to say the United States Government and the Saudi Arabian Government, We shall be glad if you will be good enough, if you think fit, to take the matter up with the United States Authorities so that we may know whether they would be prepared to advise the Saudi Arabian Government that these plans are satisfactory. If there is any other information which you require on this subject, we shall be glad to let you have it and we ask that we may be kept advised of any action you may take in the matter* I am, etc*, ( Sgd.)

Arabian Government, the contention of Jordan that notice is not necessary and that the subject could be opened up again without notice and at any time is not thought to be valid. ? T either is the British contention, a© stated in your telegram of Fovember 22, that the British Government could not go so far as to tell the Government of Saudi Arabia in effect to cancel ® contract with a British company, thought to be valid, inasmuch as Article 1? of the contract permits modification or termination every five years upon notice of six months. It ip believed that notice, if given on or before December 1 is perfectly legal. In any event the notice entails modification only and not cancellation* The Department has been informed that the Allied »l military authorities in the Mediterranean theatre / * are not satisfied with the service rendered by ‘ Cable and tireless and that it is for this reason, as well a© others, that Sir idward Wilshaw is inspecting the installations of the Joinnany* e would like to point out, that if it is mutually advantageous to the United States and Saudi Arabia to operate a direct radio telegraph sex vice and if the Government of Saudi Arabia without violating its existing contractual relations with able and ireless can establish such a service, (which, under the terms of Article 1? of the existing contract, is abviously the case), then neither directly nor indirectly should the British authorities seek to T^revent such a circuit being established. If the only telegraphic seivice between London and Santiago were through all America Carles at Few York, the American Government certainly would not support All,America tables in any effort to prevent the installation of a direct x-adio-telegx’sr h circuit between London and antiago# Ouch an attitude would not reflect the harmonious co operation which should obtain between Allies in time of war nor ^orm a basis for the kind of co-operation envisaged for the post-war neriod. '^he Department believes the matter should be considered objectively and in a spirit mutually conciliatory. The American Government i© not disposed to injure the interests of Cable and ireless. However, it does not elieve that the commercial interests of one company should hinder the desire of the American and Saudi Arabian Governments to improve telegraphic relations between the two countries, nor should they become a cause of bad feeling between the British and merican Govei'nments. The Department desires that you place these views before i. Iden as soon a© oossible and express the hope that henceforth no further dif iculty will arise and that the closest co-operation between our two Governments, which can onl^ rebound to our mutual advantage, may be confidently ex acted.

I cannot see that the Americans have a genuine case for placing a wholly new wireless link between Arabia and the United States in contravention of our existing agreement with Saudi Arabia. Existing link between Dhahran and Bahrein is admittedly imperfect, but this can be remedied and necessary steps would have been taken if complaint had been made in the ) first instance either to us or to Cable and Wireless Ltd. The Americans certainly cannot expect to have a terminal wherever a Consul is stationed; and it should be pointed out to them ; that installation of such a terminal would not eliminate the problem of getting messages from outlying posts to terminal for transmission.

If it will remove the sense of urgency which the American negotiations give rise to, and will not commit us in any way, should have no objection to Ibn Sand's suggestion to notify his desire to modify [grp. undec. ?either] agreement. Alternatively and preferably we might agree to a temporary postponement of last date for giving notice. This would enable the matter to be examined calmly as compared with present slightly hysterical atmosphere. And it will be for the Americans to develop their case that their oil interests are seriously affected which is not apparent to us at present. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's position in Persia is analogous to the present case and no difficulties have been experienced though the Company has of course been of high strategic importance throughout the war.

BaiEDIATE kkkkk ^^ 5,0 ^ 24 y ^ eSld ~ en 'k Jti ^tster Ca iro's telegram to Foreign Office 4allace Murray was told by Stettinius last night to instruct Y/inant to take up with you personally and urgently use of a wireless transmitting station at Dhahran. He under stands that the President may also telegraph to the Prime % Minister, Wallace Murray said ho much hoped we could reach a satisfactory agreement on this matter, as on so many others • concerning the Middle East, without its assuming such high importance. He is delaying instructions to Y/inant until November 20th so that you may know beforehand. He went on to say the more he considers the matter the more strongly he feels that facilities provided at present are quite inadequate. This has been further brought home to State Department by the fact that newly arrived American Consul at Dhahran is like the Oil Company, unable to communicate with Washington except by sending his telegrams by hand on a tug to Bahrein where they are handed over to an American Naval Officer who in delivering hands them on to Cable and Wireless Ltd. for transmission. Now that the matter has been brought to their attention they feel that this shov/s still more definite need for direct means of communication between Dhahran and the United States. He showed a disposition to raise the v/hole question of rights and wrongs of commercial monopolies by private companies. After a long talk he was persuaded to revert again to specific issue of needs of American Consul and of Oil Company in time of war for adequate means of direct communication with United States, but on this point it was impossible to shake his view that conditions are wholly unsatisfactory, and that if tables were reversed United States G-overnment would be only too glad to s^)ielp His Majesty's Government. 2. State Department evidently feels that their request to us for assistance is so reasonable that they are confident that we will find some means to help them. The matter is of course linked in their minds with other questions in Middle East and elsewhere which Y/allace Murray is.handling with us, e.g. Ethiopia and Balkans, and Ms unfortunately looming dispro portionately large here at the moment. I have done everythingI can to treat it as an isolated issue and to minimise its importance, but it is the kind of question which, however ^small in itself, arouses very strong feeling here, I note from Jedda telegram No, U 8 that Ibn Saud is suggesting that he might send Cable and tireless Ltd, formal notification of his desire to modify terms of agreement in order to allow more time for discussing main question.

BRINSLEY RICHARDS Joint Secretaries 28th November, 1944. PUL (s)| Me; '•rtftt SAUDI ARABIA - PROPOSED W.T. STATION AT DHAHRAN 1. At their 137th Meeting on 25th July the Committee discussed an application from the Arabian American Oil Company for permission to set up a W.T. Station at Dhahran for direct communication abroad, particularly with America, It was proposed that the Station should be run either by the Company themselves or by the Saudi Arabian Government. As a result of their discussions the Committee decided to place it on record that they viewed this proposal, in v/hatever form it materialised, with alarm. They regarded the Persian Gulf as a very important area'from the security standpoint and considered that the control of communications would prove extremely difficult. They requested, therefore, that Censorship should not be asked to undertake such a difficult commitment. The following developments have occurred since the Committee recorded their decision:- 2. On 1st. September, the Foreign Office sent a telegram (No, 174) to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda: (a) stating that the Security Authorities in this country viev/ed the project with alarm, (b) pointing out that the Oil Company's traffic was almost entirely of the D.L. T. category and that the messages were reaching their destination in good time for delivery, (c) suggesting that if the Oil Company wished to improve the speed of trans mission of their messages a higher priority traffic class should be filed, and (d) promising that investigation would be made into any telegram which the Oil Company claimed to have been unduly long in transit. His Majesty's Minister subsequently communicated the arguments contained in the Foreign Office telegram to the Saudi Arabian Government and also mentioned the matter to the U. S. Minister at Jedda. 3. On 9th October the U.S. Embassy in London wrote to the Foreign Office stating that they had received a telegram from the Department of State concerning tele communications between the United States and Saudi Arabia. The Department pointed out that present facilities were inadequate and that the U.S. Government were anxious to see established as soon as possible a direct radio telegraph between the two countries. The Department then referred to the existing concession between the Saudi Arabian Government and Cable and Wireless Limited, whereby the latter has an effective monopoly of telecommunications between Saudi Arabia and other countries,»■ This Agreement was valid until May 31st i 960 , but six months notice of its-modifica tion or termination could be given on December 1st 194A# The Department suggested 'that a solution to the difficulty would be the establishment by the Saudi Arabian G-ovemment of a radio telegraph station to communicate with the U. S.A, and other countries not served by the Eastern Telegraph Company. A. A telegram was received by the Foreign Office from His Majesty's Ambassad^at Washington dated 2?th October (No. 5,835) stating that this question had been discussed between H, M. Embassy and the Department of State, The telegram confirmed that the Department were pressing for the. establishment of a wireless telegraph station at Dhahran. 5. On 3rd November the Foreign Office sent a telegram (No. 9515) to H.M. Ambassador at Washington summarising the previous history of this case. It was pointed out that the normal practice had been for the Oil Company's messages to be conveyed by their own launch to Bahrein. As the traffic concerned was almost entirely of the D.L.T. category (which was not due for delivery until the morning of the second day after filing) the time occupied by the launch could be regarded as not material. If the Oil Company wished to improve the speed of transmission of their messages a higher priority traffic class should be filed. Moreover, the possibility could be explored of the trmarnission of messages over the Oil Company's own wireless link (handsending W/T or wireless telephony) between Dhahran and Bahrein. Finally it was stated that the service of Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. had been efficient in the past and no claim had been made that any telegrams had been unduly delayed in transit. 6. Arrangements have been made for discussion to take place between the Minister Resident at Cairo and Sir E. Wilshaw (the Chairman of Cable and Wireless Ltd) as to practical means of speeding up communications between Saudi Arabia and Cable &amp; Wire less terminals. 7. On 12th November H.M. Ambassador at Y/ashington sent a telegram to the Foreign Office (No. 6114) stating that a further conversation had taken place between H.M. Embassy and the Department of State. The Department still consider that the present arrangements are both inadequate and unsatisfactory. They consider that the conten tion that there is no urgent traffic, because messages at present sent via Bahrein are almost entirely of D\L.T. category, is not valid, since there are in fact urgent messages which are sent at present by the Company's tug. Accordingly the Department are . still pressing for the establishment of the W,T. Station at Dhahran. On the other hand they agree that Censorship is necessary and they suggest that arrangements should be made for a British and an American Censorship to censor all messages sent by the Company if a transmitting station is erected. 8.

The Oaudi Arabian Government maintain small wireless stations at Al Khobar, Qatif, Ojair, Dhamnam, and Jubail. Their wireless station at Horuf which is some little distance from Dhahran is in communication twice daily with the instal lation of Ttessrs. Cable and tireless Limited at Bahrain and runs its own schedules with Al Khobar the nearest subsidiary station to the Arabian American Cil Company at Dhahran. 3. I suggest that the most satisfactory procedure would be for N.L.T. traffic, which constitutes nearly 39 per cent of the telegrams emanating from and addressed to the Arabian American Oil Company, to continue to be received here and delivered to the Company's agent for onward transmission to Saudi Arabia by launch, as this traffic is dealt with here by automatic transmitter and receiver human error is practically eliminated with the further advantage to the Company of cost ing less as Bahrain is shown as the terminal station instead of a Saudi Arabian station. Messrs. Cable and hireless Limited and the Saudi Arabian Government could come to a working agreement by which daily ' schedules are arranged between a1 Khobar and Bahrain so that immediate and other urgent messages could be dealt with at once. It might even be possible for them to come to an agreement by which they worked schedules every four hours which would be more than adequate to deal with the traffic. Such an arrange ment would necessitate the Saudi Arabian Government employing a “iioraan' script operator at Al Khobar. 4. At the same time I think it should be pointed out that the Saudi Arabian Government are losing terminal fees on this traffic and it might be worth their while to instal an auto matic transmitter and receiver in their Al Khobar office and accept all traffic for the Arabian American Oil Company direct from Bahrain.

Acting Minister for Foreign affairs recently told me United States Minister was pressing Saudi Arabian Governnent to arree to the proposal for a wireless station at Dhahran. I repeated the arguments contained in your .telegran No. 174 and he seened satisfied. 2. I subsequently mentioned the natter to the United States Minister and mentioned that there were security objections which a United States representative had agreed. I have since wondered whether I had been indiscreet in doing so but it now seems well that I did, since it provides an additional proof (besides air having originally consulted their censorship representative) of our desire to^ co-operate with then. Eddy never broached the matter to me before approaching the Saudi Arabian Government about it. 3 . With reference to paragraph 5 of the telegram under reference there has never been any appr^ch by us to the Saudi ^mrabian Government in the matter. Approach was by the Saudi Arabian Government to us.and we immediately consulted a United States representative on the security aspect. 4, Eddy expressed the opinion that the right course was to make the necessary alteration in the contract of Cable and Wireless Limited now as it was due for renewal but to. postpone realisation of the project until-security objections no longer existed. 5 . It seems to me that the Oil Company's request is not entirely unreasonable as necessity to send cables to Bahrein for transmission must cause much inconvenience and delay, i presume the present situation in Dhahran was not envisaged when nrn rnnfd non tract was made.

Repeated to Washington Jedda [][][] Washington telegram No. 5835. I am much surprised at the attitude adopted by the State Department^over the question of airfields and cable communications in Saudi Arabia. In neither case did they consult you or inform Jordan before submitting their request to Ibn Saud. Both requests came to our knowledge from the Saudi Arabian Government who sought advice which was given in your teleg rams Nos. 60 and 17L addressed to Jedda. The State Department's attitude over cable communications is particularly objectionable since they were aware that their proposals were contrary to existing Saudi Eastern Telegraph • Company's concession. As they claim that both projects are connected with the war effort, surely we as allies should have been consulted especially v/here British concessionary rights were adversely affected. Had they referred the question of cable communications to us before approaching the Saudi Arabian Government it would have been comparatively simple to improve existing communications either by persuading Eastern Telegraph Company with Saudi consent, to lay a cable between El Khobar and Bahrein or to arrange for Eastern Telegraph Company to receive messages from existing Saudi wireless station at El Khobar or by some other means which would not have been prejudical to the existing concession. In few if any cases have any of the Company's messages been sent except at N.L.T. rates and I understand that it is [group undec.] to send messages by boat to Bahrein except to deny contents to Saudi Arabian Government since a telephone exists between the mainland and Ismailia,e - 2 - .. ... . i s therefore doubtful that the Grovernment's Z G0 ^ s ^ r ^ t a ? airfield at bahran is chiefly for the bene!it of oil company who hope to receive several aircraft shortly. ai) P ears y Q t another example of United States ideas, e.g. they do all the taking and we concurs ^ 1Vln ^* Jordan has seen this telegram and [Copies sent to ivir. ¥iltshire].

V % [Begins] , • The State Department consider•that Arabian American Oil Company in construction of refinery at Ras Tanura in Saudi ^rabia is engaged in an important war time project. This company Has vital need of easy and rapid communication with the United states. Because of the monopoly of Cable and Wireless Limited which main tains only a cable station at Jedda on,the,opposite side ot Saudi Arabia, there are no communication facilities available for the company nearer than Bahrein where messages have to be sent by hand transmission. , In view of the failure of Cable and^Wireless Limited to establish adequate communication facilities on the „ side of Saudi Arabia the company suggested that the Saudi Arabian Government establish a radio station of its own in Ras Tanura area. This of course would have involved notice by the saudi Arab Government to the Cable and Wireless Limited, to alter the ter of agreement as provided for therein on June 1st lU^o [sicj Having received no clear indication from the Saudi,Araoian Govern ment of its attitude the company requested the assistance 01 the State Department in view of xhe company s relation to the a effort. Upon enouiry at Jedda American Minister learned that London objected to radio station and that its objection was conveyed to Saudi Arabian Government, This action was £ot revealed to /TheThe State Department feel in this and Dhahran airfield matters there have been direct and deliberate concealment of approaches to Saudi Arabian Government with regard to matters of concern to United States Government and furtherance of the war effort. ' The State Department regard these actions as manifests of a most un-cooperative attitude and entirely incompatible with mutually expressed desires to co-operate. The Department is as anxious as anyone to maintain security of important messages in wartime and is confident that this problem can be solved with regard to a radio station in eastern Saudi Arabia with but little difficulty. 2. [sic] Berle said that memorandum was not intended as an official communication. Had it been so, I have no doubt that- it would have been drafted more temperately. , But I think it best to send you text none the less. ■Berle was informed that Embassy had no (repeat no) knowledge of the matter and that we could not accept this version of events..‘He;Was alse asked whether.

Eddy never broached the matter to me before approaching the Saudi Fabian Government about it. 3. With reference to parr..graph 5 of the telegram under reference there has never been any approach by us to the Saudi Arabian Government in the natter, approach was by the Saudi Arabian Government to us and we immediately consulted a United States representative on the security aspect. 4, Eddy expressed the opinion that the right course was to make the necessary alteration in the contract of Gable and Wireless Limited now as it was due for renewal but to postpone realisation of the project until security objections no longer existed. 5, It seems to. me that the Oil Conpany r s request is not I entirely unreasonable as necessity to send cables to Bahrein j for transmission must cause much inconvenience and delay.

I do not thin&amp; I can iter than quote the relevant p^rt of the letter as sent to The delay on ordinary telegrams from San Francisco (where most of the messages to Bahrein come from) to nabrein is approximately 18 hours between filing and receipt, ignoring geographical differences in time. On \lwTs which make up the bulk of American Arabian Oil Company's traffic, the delay is two days. Under present conditions, with censorship in force at both terminal stations, too much emphasis should not be given to the delay factor. Under normal peace time conditions delay between Bahrein and U.3.A. on ordinary traffic would be 1 to 3 hours and on deferred 6 to 12 hours. (2) Full rate traffic from San Francisco to Bahrein costs 4/7 per word or 92 cents U.3.A. currency. From New York 3/10 or 77 cents approximately. Deferred and NLT costs are proportionate. (3) The Oil Company 1 a launch service Bahrein - Daharan takes 3 hours. (4) Daharan W/T is capable of working handaeuding or wireless telephony with Caole &amp; Wireless at Bahrein. (This is worth noting.) (5) Bahrein censorship closes down from 1930 to 0730 hours local time. As first launch leaves Bahrein for Daharan at 0730 overnight telegrams miss this launch. Cable &amp; Wireless Manager at Bahrein has been instructed to approach the censorship Authorities and explain the position. (6) Traffic to and from Saudi .rabia via Bahrein/H2E averages monthly 130 and 80 messages respectively. Traffic is mostly local for places in Arabia and increases to 200 and 1400 respectively during the Pilgrim season. (7) HZE (Saudi Arabian station near Daharan) is not equipped to deal with a large volume of traffic. Station works two short schedules daily at 0630 and 1230 G.M.T. I agree with para. 2 of your letter but an argument in our favour is that oil developments do not call for an express cable or wireless service. This is borne out by the fact that the Oil Company uses NLT facilities almost exclusively. M W.G.

I pointed out there were various ways of doing this and the worst delay is in the ’’hand over* between the Oil organisation and the C. ft W. office at Bahrein. You will note from the extract above that there are certain things that can be done immediately, e.g. arranging the launch trips to coincide with the time when the censorship oureau is open; also there seems no reason why Bahrein itself should not communicate directly into -tne C. &amp; W. office with low powered wireless and thus save the time of the launch Journey. C. ft W. have promised to do what they can to speed this business up. In my view, always provided C. ft ¥. set themselves out to cater for this traffic properly and come to an appropriate agreement with the Saudi Arabian authorities and the Oil Company, there seems to be no legitimate reason for the Oil Company to establish their own wireless station.

Dear Hayter, With reference to your letter of the 4th August regarding the transmission of the Arabian American Oil Company^ traffic from or tne rotn August that messages from Dhahran are conveyed to Bahrein for transmission to the U.S.A. The normal practice is for the messages to be conveyed by the Oil Comparer's launch to Bahrein (approximately 40 miles), and as the traffic concerned is almost entirely of the DLT category, which is not due for delivery until the morning of the second day after filing, the time occupied by the launch will not be material, Examination of the traffic has shown that the messages are reaching their destination in good time for delivery. If the Oil Company wish to improve the speed of transmission of their messages a higher priority traffic class should be filed and messa 3 might also be sent over the Oil Company’s own wireless link between Dhahran and Bahrein. We do not enow of course what periods of service they maintain on this link. I may add that Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd, would be glad to investigate in detail the handling of ary telegram which the Oil Company claim to have been unduly OQoap4cd in transit. We have no objection to your proposed reply to Jedda as stated in the second paragraph of your letter of the 4th August.« / (ft U634/104/G) s ?; c k ? &gt; FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 4th August, 1944. ^ ly t&amp;K +* 1 Dear Lewis, v - ^ With reference to our printed letter number W 11125/1476/801 of the 18th July last about the request of the Arabian American Oil Company to set up their own Vireless Telegraphy Station at Dhahran, I now enclose two further telegrams on this subject. 2. fte propose, subject to your concurrence, to reply to Jedda to the effect that, quite apart from the question of breach of contract, our security authorities view the project with alarm, that the representative of the United States censorship who was present at the consideration of the proposal also strongly supported the view that the proposal was dangerous to security, and that enquiries are being made into the question of alleged delays. 3. The important point, however, is that we should be able to show that Cable and Vireless are in 'act able to provide an efficient service.

It would appear from Informal enquiry which has been fciade of Cable and Wireless Ltd. that the existing service from Dhahran to the United States is reasonably rapid, but since ttpion* * are involved, a good direct wireless link would dearly provide a faster service during its hours of operation. It is not clear whether it is contemplated that the proposed wireless station should work to places other than the United States; if schedules were wo iked to several points the existing facilities mi$it well be more rapid at certain times of the day. As indicated in paragraph 4 of the telegram from Jedda, the agreement between Cable and Wireless Ltd. and the Saudi- Arabian Government gives the Company the monopoly of external oammunioations with the exception that the looal Government reserves the right to connunioate by wireless telegraph with neighbouring countries. In these Giroumstanoes the Seers iK-iiy of Stats will, no doubt, agree that if the proposal is to be pursued Cable and Wireless Ltd. should be given the first opportunity of establishing the station at Dhahran. As, however. The Under-Seerstary of State, * FOREIGN OFFICE.the Secretary of State is aware, strong objection to the proposal on security gxoimds was recorded at the 137th meeting of the Sub- CoBBdttee Standing Interdepartmental Coixmittee on Censorship on 25th July.

Sir, In reply to Your excellency's despatch No. M. 91 (54-N-6) of November 27th., 1939, concerning the desire of the Saudi Arabian Government to modify the 1935 Telegraph Agreement, I have the honour to inform you that the Saudi Arabian Government, in response to the enquiry which Mr# Trott addressed to them in accordance with the second paragraph of your despatch, have now informed me that they desire the modification of article 11 and of paragraph 3 of Article 14 of the Agreement. It appears probable that the intention of the Saudi Arabian Government in mentioning paragraph (3) of Article 14 was to include all Article 14 subsequent to the figure (3) in the English text: i.e. to include the question of the Saudi Arabian Government’s rights to telegraph to countries beyond the Yemen, Iraq, Trans-Jordan and Syria, via the telegraphic services to those countries. 3* The Saudi Arabian Government have also been informed that you agree to the proposed negotiations, and now await your views concerning details of time and place.

The question whether there will be any objection to a particular modification desired by the Saudi Arabian Government must be left until further details are known.

July 29th, 1939. Sir, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, the Secretary to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, mentioned to me in a recent conversation that the Saudi Arabian Government had decided to enter into negotiations with a view to securing certain modifications in the agreement which they had signed in 1935 with the Sudan Government and the Eastern Telegraph Company Limited and Cables and Wireless Limited. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said that his instructions were that he should issue to the other two parties the proper notifications under Article 17 of that agreement. On his enquiring as to the proper method of approaching the Sudan Government I suggested that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs should address to this Legation a note declaring their wishes in the matter, so that I could communicate it to the proper quarter. The only information I was able to gather concerning the particular points on which modification was desired was to the effect that Articles 11 and 14 would have to be revised. 2 . I have now received from His Royal Highness the Amir Feisal a note dated July 25th, 1939, a copy of v/hich in translation I enclose. I shall be grateful to be informed in due course of your views in the matter. From the text of the agreement (which was dated the 13th, not the 10 th. Khartoum.033) agreement operates until June 1st, 1940, but that as the Saudi Arabian Government have taken advantage of their right to request a modification, a right which they had to exercise before December 1st, 1939, negotiations concerning the points which the Saudi Arabian Government may raise will have to be undertaken in such a way that a settlement is reached before June 1st, 1940. I have not seen the text of the communication made by the Director of Posts and Telegraphs on July 22nd, 1939, to the Eastern Telegraph Company Limited: but if that communication gives no details of the modifications which the Saudi Arabian Government desire, I suggest that when Your excellency authorises me to acknowledge on your behalf the receipt of this notification I might request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to set forth in detail what the Saudi Arabian Government have in their minds.

April 15th., 1939. My dear Baxter, We have been thinking about communication with the outside world in case of war. All telegraphic communications between Jedda and the outside world pass over the Jedda - Port Sudan cable, except a few messages which may come via the Saudi wireless at Riyadh from Iraq and other countries on the north. We assume that Saudi Arabia would be neutral, and that it would not be in the interests of the enemy to occupy Jedda. Moreover since the cable is useful both to the Saudi Arabian Government and to the Italian representative here, it would not be in the interests of the enemy to interrupt its working. If, however, the cable should break down and to send a repair ship would be inconvenient, or if the enemy should be able to sit on the cable or its continuing line in the Sudan or Egypt for a while, telegrams to or from the Legation might be held up to our great harm. A wireless transmitting set could only be installed with the consent of the Saudi Arabian Government, and even if we were prepared to ask for this consent in an emergency we do not want to raise the question now. There are many sets in Jedd* for the reception of news and other broadcasts, and any of these could presumably be used for reception of official messages, by previous agreement. Ibn Saud possesses some sixty wireless telegraph receiving and transmitting sets, and as/ • t C. W. Baxter Esq., M.G Foreign Office.as several wireless telephone sets are being installed for him by the American oil company he might perhaps be willing to lend us one of the telegraph sets. If the Jedda wire less station was working it could perhaps reach some British station, but it isn’t and anyhow I don't know its extreme range. Telegrams from Jedda to Riyadh now go to Taif by land line and thence by wireless to Riyadh, and if the worst came to the worst we could send telegrams that way and have them sent on from Riyadh to Bahrain. But I don’t know how telegrams at present go from Riyadh to Bahrain. Moreover, the process would be very slow, with at least two places where the message had to be repeated, and my experience last November showed how corrupt telegrams could become even between Riyadh and Jedda. The most satisfactory policy, if Ibn Baud would allow it, would perhaps be for us to have a transmitting set which could reach Bahrain or some other place on that side, or possibly Aden. We have on our clerical staff an expert who was a Marconi operator on a steamer for several years, and both the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have wireless experts for their wireless telephone who would probably be sufficiently well disposed to help us if there was a breakdown which Johnston could not solve. An alternative would be for us to use the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s wireless telephone. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate is an American company, mainly, as to its capital, but for income tax reasons it is registered in Bermuda. The manager, however, is an American citizen, and although we are on good terms with him and he speaks loudly against the totalitarian states, he would probably require orders from his principals before he would allow the Legationcm to use his wireless telephone. I do not know at present what its range is, but C.A.S.O.C. (the American oil company) speak quite easily to their people in Hasa, and I fancy that the sets do not differ very much, so v/e might hope to be able to speak to Bahrain with the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate’s set if Bahrain possessed a suitable receiver. This is all rather vague, but I thought it would be a good thing to send you all the information we have at present, and also to send copies to the Commissioner at Port Sudan and to Bushire and Bahrain, in the hope that they might perhaps be able to make suggestions. We are also sending a copy to the Chancery at Cairo for information. Yours ever, (Signed) R.W.

He is not an engineer, but is experienced in traffic work and the High Commissioner is advised by the Post-Master General that a traffic survey should precede the technical engineering survey. 2 . I shall be grateful to learn whether this officer’s selection on the above-mentioned basis is agreeable to the Saudi Arabian Government: and if Your Royal Highness could be so good as to give me an urgent reply I could telegraph your acceptance to Jerusalem, in order that Hussein Nusrat Sabri should catch the Kedivial steamer which is due to arrive at Jedda on August 28th. 3.

No Muslim Officer of sufficient seniority and experience capable of organising posts, telegraphs, telephones and wireless is available, but the names of the following two recently retired British officers who are considered suitable are suggested ;• (a) Mr,R,S,Purssell, C,I*E., 0,B,E., who is at present on leave preparatory to retirement, held the post of Chief Engineer in the Posts and Telegraphs Department and officiated as Director General, He has extensive experience of telegraphs, telephones and wireless and is also acquainted with the postal side of the organisation.

He is a Telegraph Engineer and has full knowledge of telegraphs, telephones and wireless. Both these officers have recently proceeded to the United Kingdom, and to save time it is suggested that they may kindly be consulted direct by the India Office whether they would be prepared to accept employment in Saudi Arabia and on what terms. 3. As regards a technical expert for telegraphs, telephones and wireless, it is not possible to get one officer who is an expert in all these three branches. Owing to the shortage of wireless staff, no technical expert for this branch of work can be conveniently spared, but if a cnadidate is not forthcoming from elsewhere it might be possible to depute an officer of the rank of Deputy Assistant Engineer for a period of one year. As regards telegraphs, a Muslim or Anglo-Indian Officer of the rank of Deputy Assistant Engineer could be made available. Similarly for telephones, an Anglo-Indian Officer of the rank of Assistant Engineer or a Muslim officer of the rank of Engineering Supervisor could probably be found. A statement showing the scales of pay drawn by these officers in India is attached. It would be necessary to offer considerably (say from 50 to 100 %) more than these scales of pay to attract suitable candidates. The issue of the above has been authorised.

Should it prove impossible to obtain the required experts from Palestine, Lord Halifax proposes to make enquiries in Egypt and to suggest that, provided Lord Zetland sees no objection, the possibility should be explored of furnishing the necessary personnel from India. Meanwhile there might be no objection to informing the Government of India by air mail that this enquiry has been received and that the Government of Palestine are in the first instance being consulted in the matter; it might further be suggested that the Government of India should make preliminary enquiries with a view to ascertaining whether suitable candidates are available in India and the approximate terms for their engagement for communication to the Saudi Arabian Government. 3.

CONFIDENTIAL. ?Q May 13, 1935. Section 2. [E 2955/66/25] Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 13.) (No. 115.) Sir, Jedda, April 18, 1935. WITH reference to my telegram No. 96j)f the 17th April, I have the honour to submit a summary report on the proceedings connected with the agreement reached on that date between the joint owners of the Jedda-Port Sudan cable and the two companies concerned, the Eastern Telegraph Company (Limited) and Cable and Wireless (Limited). 2. Admiral H. W. Grant, C.B., and Mr. H. R. Staples, the joint representatives of the companies, arrived in Jedda on the 31st March in the cable ship Lady Denison Pender, accompanied by Mrs. Grant and an interpreter. Just before they arrived the Saudi Government expressed a wish themselves to entertain the delegation, but they deferred to my suggestion that it would be more practical for Admiral and Mrs. Grant and Mr. Staples to stay at the Legation during their visit. 3. On the 1st April I introduced the delegates to Fuad Bey Hamza, with whom were Sheikh Abdullah Kazim, the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, and two of his subordinates. The formal negotiations began that afternoon. It was decided at the outset not to attempt to amend or supplement the working agreement of 1926, but to work out an entirely new and comprehensive agreement. 4. The negotiations were conducted in the first stage by Fuad Bey Hamza and the above-mentioned experts on the Saudi side, and by the above-mentioned delegates of the companies. Fuad Bey twice returned to Mecca, and was detained there the second time by indisposition. He was replaced by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin for a short time. The two texts were finally agreed on the 16th April, and were duly signed at the Khuzam Palace early on the next afternoon. As a result of correspondence with the Sudan Government, I signed the agreement on their behalf, subject to the terms of the declaration annexed to it, having secured your approval for this procedure in your telegram No. 67 of the 13th April. 5. I enclose copies of the following papers :— (a) A letter addressed by me to Fuad Bey on the 14th April;(') (b) The English version of the agreement; and (c) A despatch which I addressed to the Governor-General of the Sudan after the signature^ 1 ) 6. I have seldom known a negotiation conducted in a better spirit or in a better atmosphere. The delegates of the two companies approached the matter with great largeness of view and, though the Saudi Government wanted and got a good deal, they also were animated by an evident desire to come to terms. Although I took no part in the formal negotiations, I was in constant touch with Admiral Grant and Mr. Staples, and had one or two private exchanges with Fuad Bey and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. 7. As for the more general setting, I may mention that the King, to whom I presented the companies’ delegates on the 2nd April, did them the. honour, not very usual in Jedda nowadays, of himself giving a dinner in their honour on the 3rd April. The Heir Apparent with a number of junior princes and other high personages visited the Lady Denison Pender on the afternoon of that day. After the agreement was signed, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman gave us an enormous luncheon at the palace, and in the evening my wife and I entertained him, Fuad Bey and the various delegates at dinner. I report these incidents because the cordiality shown reflects a desire on the part of Ibn Sand and his Government (’iNot printed [406 n—2]2 t for good relations not only with the companies but with His Majesty s Govern ment, who had done so much to promote the conclusion of a satisfactory agicement. 8. The agreement itself calls for few comments. The reduction of rates will be a boon to the public and to some extent to His Majesty s Government, who are at present, unfortunately, the largest users of the cable. Article 9 enects a more equitable distribution of rates collected for wireless transmission when^^ the cable is interrupted, and one to which the Sudan Government readily assente^^^- on my consulting them. Article 14 was the only clause which gave rise to material difficulty, as it qualifies the monopoly accorded by article 11 to a greater extent than Cable and Wireless (Limited) were at first ready to accept. I was myself opposed to the possible creation of independent public services in Arabia, and I should have preferred to see the provision for independent official communication with Syria limited to trans-frontier messages. The Saudi Government, were, however, adamant on both points. T ne arrangements regarding wireless communication between Hasa and Bahrein are, I think, satisfactory. 9. The delegates of the companies left for Port Sudan in the Lady Denison Pender on the 18th April. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures (where not already forwarded to Khartum) to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Bushire, Cairo and Khartum. I have, &amp;c.

If above appreciations are correct interest ox His Majesty's Government and the Sudan Government may conflict eventually. As early conflict is however un likely I am inclined to agree with Governor-General's suggestion. It is open to objection that some two weeks might be required to get a Sudan representative here later but my present impression is that the first phase of the Conference will be inconclusive and that it may have to be interrupted in any case. VJhat are your views? Company may wish to strengthen their initial position by claiming that article 6 of working agreement legally covers the whole of Saudi Arabia. Ii so what should my attitude be?

Paragraph 6. I agree with your view. Article in question is badly drafted but I am advised that, read in conjunction with article 12, its meaning should be taken to be that Ibn Saud’s Government undertakes not to allow the use for foreign communications from the Hejaz either of its own wireless or cables or of those of any other company. In other words a geographical area is intended and not the entire governmental communications of Ibn Baud’s Government. 3. You may, if necessary, warn company’s representativ that His Majesty’s Government hold this view.

A Conference is to take place at Jeddah in a few days time between representatives of the Saudi Government and of Cable and Wireless Ltd. to discuss the subject of Saudi cable and wireless communications, and the Saudi Government have now agreed that the question of establishing wireless communication^ between Hasa and Bahrein should be dealt with in these discussions It will be remembered that the Saudi Government previously suggested the conclusion of a direct agreement between themselves and the Bahrein Government on the latter question, but it was made quite clear to them that ^-M.ft. could not contemplate a direct agreement of this kind. The Saudi Government had drawn up a detailed draft of their proposed agreement with the Bahrein Government and a copy of this is enclosed in the Foreign Office letter of 12th March below. The Foreign Office now propose to communicate the substance of it to Cable and Wireless Ltd. as soon as the latter have formally agreed to the inclusion of the question of the Hasa-Bahrein service in the agenda of the Conference. There can be no objection to this and we need not, I think, offer any observations on the terms of the Saudi draft, since details such as these of a commercial nature should obviously be decided by the Saudi Government and the Company in the course of the negotiations.

Your Excellency, In continuation of this Ministry’s letter No. 165/5/11 of 9th Jumad ath-Thani 1355 (18th September 1954) addressed to Mr. Calvert, I have the honour to forward Your Excellency herewith the proposal of a draft agreement intended to be concluded between the Government of H.M. the King and the Government of Bahrain concerning the exchange of official and commercial telegrams between the two countries. I shall be glad if you will be good enough to have it transmitted to the authorities concerned and if, after it has been studied, I may be informed of what may be thought suitable for the conclusion of that agreement. With highest respects, (Sd) Feysal. His Excellency, H.B.M’s Minister at JeddaIN accordance with the agreement between the Government of the Saudi Arab Kingdom and the Government of Bahrain for the exchange of official and commercial telegrams direct between the wireless station of Bahrain and the wireless station of Hasa (the exchange will take place) on the following conditions: 1* The wireless station of Bahrain will work in transmission between 800 or 900 (metres), 2, The wavelength of the wireless station of Hasa in transmission will be 800 (metres). The wavelength on which the wireless stations of Bahrain and Hasa will work should be considered fixed, but can be altered If the two Governments desire to change their present Installations. 5. Communication between the two sides will be effected daily morning and evening until the telegrams (for despatch) at each time are finished. In case necessity arises for effecting communication more than twice, if neither of the two parties has any objection communication can be effected as many times as is necessary. 4. Messages can be given by either party in Arabic or Latin characters in accordance with the desire of the sender. 5. Private service messages between the two stations in matters of telegrams, corrections and checking, should be conducted in the Arabic language between the two parties, 6 . Telegrams to be accepted at present from both parties are the ordinary ones and prepaid telegrams (repeated to) many addresses only. 7. Transactions bet?/een the two parties should be subject to the International Regulations recognised byall Governments 8 . The charge per word is 50 centirr es gold of which 30 centimes gold is the share of the sending administration and 20 centimes is the share of the receiving one. As to telegrams sent to any town in the Saudi Arab Kingdom apart from the town of Hasa, the charge per word will be 40 centimes (v? extra) in view of the fact that such telegrams have to be despatched again from Hasa station to their destination. 9. Telegrams belonging to the Government of the Saudi Arab Kingdom or the Government of Bahrain will be charged half the ordinary rates laid down in the proceeding article. 10, Both administrations should act as intermediary channels in despatching telegrams addressed to other destinations, and they should add the charges for those places to their (administration^) original share of the charges without anything extra (? being charged to the original transmitting station). 11, If either party requests to be given a statement of charges for telegrams despatched by it to other countries its request will be complied with at once without adding anything extra to the share of the said countries (? without adding the additional charges incurred). 12, In the event of damage occurring to the installation at Hasa, communication will be effected temporarily through the wireless station of Qatif, Jubeyl or Riyadh f until such damage is repaired; and in the event of damage occurring to the installation at Bahrain, communication will be effected through one of the neighbouring stations belonging to it.15 In the event of confusion occurring in reception by either party on account of the wavelength used in transmission by the other party, the wavelength should be altered in a manner not to cause confusion to the other party 14. Telegrams will be despatched under serial numbers to be renewed daily beginning from one to the last telegram. At the close of each day a service message should be sent by each party to the other party giving the total number of telegrams received and despatched and the Government, commercial and service ones, in order to avoid confusion in monthly accounts. 15. Service messages despatched by either partyto the other party in respect of telegrams, corrections and checking will be free of charge. 16. At the end of every month each party should send to the other party a detailed list of telegrams received and despatched and their charges. On receipt of such lists they should be checked at once, and the balance of the account should be settled before the end of the next month following the arrival of the list. 17. A difference between the accounts in the lists not exceeding a hundred francs, should be retained and the accounts should be balanced at once without settling the said difference, (regarding which communication will be exchanged between the two parties) and the difference should be entered in the account of the next month by addition or subtraction. 18. If the two parties agree to modify any one of the articles drawn up in this agreement or to add anything to it, action will be taken in accordance with the latest agreement from the date it came into force. 19. If either party wishes to terminate this agreement.it should notify the other party accordingly, but this agreement will remain in force until the expiry of one year after the notification is given. After the lapse of this period the agreement will be considered as annulled. 20. Provisions of this agreement shall be put into force as fromQ5v Note on the position in regard to the External Telegraphic Communications of Saudi Arabia. 1. The position as regards the Jedda Port Sudan cable is determined by two agreements concluded on December 18th 1926. One was an agreement between the Governments of the Sudan and the Hejaz, with His Majesty's Government as a third and assenting party, vesting the ownership of the cable in the two first-named governments. The other was an agreement between the joint owners and the Eastern Telegraph Company, by which the company undertook to work the cable. This working agreement was made in principle for 25 years but was terminable at two years notice by either side. It was provided by an exchange of notes that, if either of the joint owners should wish to terminate the agreement the other must conform to the vi®ws of the Government expressing the wish. Under a clause in the V/orking Agreement, the Hejaz Government gave a monopoly of external telegraphic communication to the Company. 2, These agreements were concluded expressly In the name of the Hejaz Government, at a time when it was technically distinct from the Government of Nejd and its Dependencies. The Saudi Government take the view that the monopoly clause applies only to the Hejaz. The legal aspects of this question have never been fully explored on the British side. 3. The Saudi Government have long been anxious to secure a modification of the Working Agreement with the Eastern/Eastern Telegraph Company. They consider the rates provided in it too onerous and of late they have been restive in regard to the monopoly clause, on the ground that modern developments make it undesirable that they should be so hampered. 4. When the late Sir H. Biscoe visited Ibn Saud at Hof&amp;f in January 1932, one of the questions raised was that of the establishment of telegraphic and postal communications between Hasa and the outer world. The question of telegraphic communications lapsed at that time but was later revived. Following on correspondence of which the Government of India and the Political Resident have full knowledge, His Majesty*s ChargS d’Affaires at Jedda addressed a note on the subject to the Saudi Government on September 13th, 1934. A copy of this note was enclosed in Mr. Calvert ! s despatch No. 278 of the same date to the Foreign Office and copies of that despatch and enclosure were sent to the Government of India and Bushire. 5. A few days after the despatch of Mr. Calvert f s note, but quite independently of what had passed in Jedda, Fuad Bey Hamza raised the question of the Jedda Port Sudan cable in the course of his informal conversations in London. This led to a suggestion that he might have a non-committal exchange of views with Cable and Wireless Ltd., who have replaced the Imperial and International Communications Company and who have a controlling interest in the Eastern Telegraph Company. From this exchange of views, which took place under Sir A. Ryan*s auspices on September 25th. there emerged a suggestion that Cable and Wireless Ltd. and the Saudi Government might engage in negotiations, perhaps in Jedda, with a view to agreeingon comprehensive arrangements in regard to the external telegraphic communications, by wireless and cable, of the whole of Saudi Arabia. 6 . The decision of Cable and Wireless Ltd. on the suggestion just mentioned was delayed somewhat by their perturbation at hearing that the Saudi Government had established some sort of wireless communication between Riyadh and Basra, without reference to what had passed in London, Eventually, however, the Company expressed a wish that Sir A. Ryan should propose to the Saudi Government that the latter should invite representatives of the Company to visit Saudi Arabia to negotiate an agreement. Sir A. Ryan was instructed to take action accordingly in Foreign Office telegram No. 14 of January 25th. Steps were taken at the same time to inform the Sudan Government of the position. 7. The object of this memorandum is to explain, without excessive detail, the connexion between three matters distinct in their origin, which have now come into conjunction viz. (a) the question of the Jedda Port Sudan cable (b) the question of wireless communication between Hasa and Bahrain and (c) the more general question of the use of wireless by the Saudi Government for external communication. The sequel to the correspondence etc. mentioned in the memorandum is shown by the recent telegrams. British Legation, Jedda.

The Saudi Government feel that they are now hampered by the monopoly given in 1926 to the Eastern Telegraph Company and that they should be free to use wireless for the purpose of certain external communications. They also say that the cable charges (1.50 fr. gold) allowed by the Working Agreement are so heavy as todiscourage traffic and they consider that the proportion (25cs. ) which goes to the Saudi Government is too small. It may be mentioned that Cable and Wireless Ltd. were at first apparently inclined to think that the monopoly given to the Company under the Working Agreement might be held to extend to the whole of Saudi Arabia but that the personal view of the Minister at Jedda is that the Saudi Government are justified in considering^as they * do that the monopoly affects the Hedjaz only. In this connection Sir Andrew Ryan recently remind representative of the Company that proposals fo wireless service between Hasa and Bahrein were in train (see below). 2. The subject of telegraphic communications was raised by Fuad Hamza during his recent visit to this x country, and a preliminary discussion m order to elicit the views of the various parties took place at the Foreign Office on the 25th September between Sir Andrew Ryan, Fuad Hamza, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and representatives of Cable and Wireless Ltd. A note on tne subject by Sir Andrew Ryan will be found at P.Z.6382/34. It will be seen that it was agreed that the Saudi Government and the Cable Company should consider the subject further with a view to definite negotiations and that, subject to the agreen of the Company, it is proposed that these negotiatior should take place at Jedda after Sir Andrew Ryan’s return between representatives of the Company anc the Saudi authorities. The object of the negotiatic will be to make comprehensive arrangements in regard * # to the whole of Saudi Arabia. tec 2i i - The rest of the recent correspondence on theMinute Paper, Department rm r\ Va/C! &gt;~L lr+-4. foSbC &lt;Ka POL! SEEN ^ ^ t M fTTI ^'4 9^C WW file deals with the question of the establishment by Cable and Wireless Ltd. of wireless communication between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia. This question was raised with the Political Agent, Bahrein, by the local representatives of the Cable Company, v/hich has now established a new station at Bahrein and taken over the work previously done there by the Imperial Airways wireless station. The Legation at Jedda and the political authorities in the Persian Gulf have expressed themselves in favour of promoting the establishment of wireless communication via Bahrein by arrangement between the Saudi Government and the Cable Company, and the Political Agent at Bahrein has emphasised the difficulty, in the absence of other wireless facilities, of a request from the Standard Oil Company of California, who are established both in Bahrein and in Hasa, for permission to open a wireless service of their own between these two places. In these circumstances the Charge d*Affaires at Jedda was authorised to inform the Saudi Government on behalf of the Cable Company that the Company were prepared to enter into an agreement with the Saudis for a telegraphic service between Bahrein and Hasa, andto enquire whether the Saudis were agreeable to the opening of detailed discussions between the Company and the Saudi authorities concerned (P.Z.6317/34). The Saudi Government have now replied (P.Z.6641/34) to the effect that they welcome the project and will be prepared to discuss it in due course. The question can no doubt be dealt with in the course of the detailed negotiations mentioned above, which it is proposed to hold at Jedda after Sir Andrew Ryan's return.^,, ^ ^ ^ ItswGLJ. w* -A— ?***£•**. ^ itIn any further communication on this subject, please quote ^ No. £ W^(o ^ • and address —not to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

[E 6127/74/25] October 1 , 1934. Section 5. No. 1 . I External Telegraphic Communications of Saudi Arabia. . u subject is adverted to in the general records of the conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 19th September, but it may be convenient to have a separate comprehensive record of all that has passed up to date, as the matter falls to be dealt with independently of the more or less political questions which have been discussed; 2 . Following on huad Bey’s reference to the Eastern Telegraph Company at the third general conversation on the 21 st September, it was found impiacticable to bring the Sudan Government into any further discussion during the short period of Fuad Bey s stay in London. In any case, that Government, although interested as joint owners of the Jedda-Port Sudan cable,O are much less effectively concerned than Cable and Wireless (Limited). 3. Marconi s had previously expressed a wish to see me about a report of mine in July on the alleged intention of the Saudi Government to erect a wireless station at Makhlaf in Najran. 1 took advantage of this to get into touch, through Mr. Farrer of the Department of Overseas Trade, with both Marconi’s and Cable and Wireless (Limited). Representatives of the two companies came to see me early on the 24th September, Mr. H. C. Van de Velde for Marconi’s and Mr. A. Sabater for Cable and Wireless (Limited). 4. Mr. Van de Velde told me that, since approaching the Department of Overseas Trade, Marconi’s had heard from their local agent, Mr. Philby, that there appeared to be no truth in the press report that the Saudi Government intended to erect a new wireless station in Najran. All that was intended was to utilise there one of the existing wireless sets. I told him that I had no information except what had appeared in the L mm-al-Qura newspaper before I left Jedda, and that Air. Philby’s report corresponded with what I should ha\e expected. I also said that, although I had mentioned in the same report to the Foreign Office, the presentation of automatic telephones by the Soviet to the haudi Government, I saw no connexion between the two items of information except that both bore on the general question of Saudi communications. I did not know to what use the Saudi Government intended to put the automatic telephones. Air. Van de Velde understood from Air. Philby that thev had been moved to Riadh. 5. With regard to the general question of Saudi Arabia’s external communications, Air. Sabater agreed after some discussion that, while no commitments could be entered into without reference to the board of Cable and Wireless (Limited), it might be useful for representatives of the company to have a quite informal and non-committal discussion with Fuad Bey. I need not record further what passed in my own preliminary conversation 1 with him. as much the same ground was covered later, except that he seemed inclined to think that the monopoly given to the Eastern Telegraph Company by article 6 of their Working Agreement with the joint owners of the Jedda-Port Sudan cable might be held to extend to the whole of Saudi Arabia, and that Cable and Wireless might be themselves imperilling their position by agreeing to anv external wireless service. I reminded him that proposals for such a service between Hasa and the outer world were already in train. I said that the le°’al question regarding the scope of the Eastern Telegraph Company monopoly had never been threshed out, but expressed the purely personal view that the Saudi Government were justified in considering, as they did. that the monopoly clause affected the Hejaz only. * ' J 6 . As a result of these preliminaries, Captain N. J. C. Lawson, °'eneral manager of Cable and Wdreless (Limited), and Mr. Sabater, met Fuad Bev and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba under my auspices at 11 a.m. on the 25th September, at 231 a—5] ( l ) See Aunex. Bthe foreign Office. I explained that my object was to bring about an entirely non-committal exchange of views in the hope of elucidating various questions which had arisen. There were (a) the question of rates for telegrams passing oyer the cable; (b) the position in regard to the Working Agreement with the Eastern 1 eiegraph Company; and (c) the proposal that a wireless service should be established between Hasa and the outer world. 7. Fuad Bey said that there had been many developments since tl^^ Working Agreement had been concluded in 1926, only a few months after the establishment of the Saudi regime in the Hejaz. The situation had been greatly affected by wireless developments. His Government were now hampered by the monopoly given in 1926 to the Eastern Telegraph Company, as regards the Hejaz, which then had a separate Government. They felt that the cable rates were so heavy as to discourage traffic, which might be greatly increased if they were lower. I hey also thought that they should be free to use wireless for the purpose of certain external communications, e.g., with Syria and Bahrein. At present the Saudi Government were tied to the use of the cable for Hejaz communications. The agreed charge per word was 1 fr. 50 c. gold, but of this only 2 £ centimes went to the Saudi Government, who were in the position of being a joint owner of the cable, but deriving no profit from it. 8 . 1 he representatives of Cable and Wireless (Limited) pointed out that the amount of traffic was small, but entailed as much expenditure as if it were gi.eat. They seemed doubtful whether any reduction of the charges would stimulate traffic sufficiently to compensate the company. As regards wireless, they did not think that the Saudi Government realised how costly it would be to provide stations really suitable for external communication and to keep them up efficiently. They suggested that a cable service was much to be preferred. They asked Fuad Bey, without commitment, what his ideas of an acceptable charge would be. 9. Fuad Bey expressed the view that a judgment could only be formed on a study of figures, but intimated that his personal idea of a suitable rate would be 1 fr. per word, half to go to the Saudi Government. In reply to a question, he thought that, if a revised agreement was made, the Saudi ! Government might be prepared to give the company greater security of tenure u modifying the clause under which the Working Agreement can be terminated at two years’ notice, although he thought in principle that this provision was sound, having regard to the effect of changing conditions. ^ 10. ^ In the course of further discussion I observed that, in my opinion, the Saudi Government could hardly expect a reduction in rates, unless they were prepared to give either security of tenure or a guarantee of minimum traffic. I emphasised the peculiar nature of the present traffic, which consisted to a disproportionate extent of official telegrams. 1 rather thought that His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government between them accounted for something like 50 per cent, of the total traffic. I suggested that the discussion had enabled each side to appreciate the point of view of the other, and might pave the way for some agreement covering all the questions at issue. 11 . It vvas agreed that the Saudi Government and Cable and Wireless should consider the subject further in the light of what had passed, with a view to definite negotiations. Fuad Bey suggested that such negotiations might conveniently take place in Jedda after my return. I said that without wishing to impose this view on the company, I should see advantage in a discussion at Jedda, and offered to do anything I could to facilitate it if the company should agree to send representatives there, although the question of a new agreement was naturally a matter for settlement on commercial lines between the Government and the company. ^ made cleai at the close that, if negotiations for a new agreement were undertaken, the object would be to make comprehesive arrangements in regai d to the whole of 8 &gt;audi Arabia, although the arrangements for particular areas might vary. r 13.

MAFFEY.Draft 2800 500 lf2tMAZ.«v rCKpO. &lt;yi2l Sc^&gt;. f^34 iPZ Uw(l4&gt;) j The next subject on Fuad Bey’s list was the question of telegraphic and wireless communication between Saudi Arabia and the outer world, with parliciilar referehce to the provisions of the Jedda-Fort Sudan Uable /agreement. Fuad Bey recalled the fact that the Saudi Government were debarred by article 6 of this agreement from using their wireless stations in the Hejaz for the purpose of communication with other countries. When the agreement had been signed there were two separate Governments, in the Hejaz and in Nejd. and the agreement had been interpreted as applying to the Hejaz only. The situation had now greatly changed in every respect; and the Saudi Government were finding it exceedingly inconvenient to be obliged to send all telegraphic communications from the Hejaz by the Port Sudan cable. A French company, the Radio Orient, and various Italian interests had also approached the Saudi Government in the matter. Sir A. Ryan recalled that the working agreement had been entered into by the Sudan and Hejaz Governments jointly as joint owners, and by the Eastern Telegraph Company as workers, of the cable. The agreement was terminable on two years’ notice, to be given either by both joint owners or by the company. Fuad Bey said that an exchange of notes had taken place between the Sudan and Saudi Governments arranging that if the Saudi Government should approach the Sudan Government with a view to the termination of the agreement, the Sudan Government would agree to join in giving the required notice. Sir A . Ryan stated that the interpretation of the agreement had in the past given rise to various legal difficulties which had not, however, been pursued, as the amalgamation of the Eastern Telegraph Company with Marconis seemed to have simplified the problem. On the Persian Gulf side, however, a somewhat similar problem had arisen over the question of communications between Hasa and Bahrein. Conversations had taken place between King Ibn Saud, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sir FI. Biscoe in 1932. No advance had been made, and the matter had lain dormant for some time, but had lately been revived, and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda had been instructed to revert to it with the Saudi Government. Fuad Bey Hamza also raised the question of the charges on the cable. It was agreed, however, that the question of the interpretation of the Jedda-Port Sudan Cable Agreement and of Saudi wireless communications with other countries was a very technical one and one in which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were not very directly interested, and that it would be preferable, therefore, that this question should not be dealt with in the proposed general settlement. It was agreed that the best course would be for a meeting to be arranged before I'uad Bey’s departure from London between himself and representatives of Cables and Wireless (Limited) (now incorporating inter alia both the Eastern Telegraph Company and Marconis) and. if possible, some representative of the Sudan Government, possibly Sir Stewart Symes, who was. understood to be in England on leave.

I decided however to omit any such reference on the grounds firstly, that a somewhat technical question of that description would be broached more appropriately b^ the Company themselves in direct negotiation, and secondly that care should be taken to minimise as far as possible any impression on the part of the eaudi G-overnment of close and intimate association, ev^n in matters of detail, between His Majesty’s Government arid the Company. 5.

I have recently been approached by Mr.R.P.Miller, who is in charge of the Geological Survey Party at present working on the mainland of Arabia near Hofuf- } -wi th-^regard I T) 7 to the opening of a direct telegraph service'bdtweep Bahrein and one of the stations maintai iedhb4Govern ment of Saudi Arabia. This matter was originally represented by the Officer-in-Charge, Bahrein, in his service telegram dated 7th November 1931 and the reply received from Head Office, vide Manager, Persian Gulf Cables 33/64 dated 26th January 1932, stated that in view of the total correspon dence between Bahrein and Arabia aggregating only 20 words per day the establishment of a direct service would be unprofitable. The situation in respect of traffic from Bahrein to Arabia has since changed owing to the erection of numerous radio stations on the Mainland. The traffic which appeared to emanate from Bahrein really came from the ports on the Mainland to the representative here of the Arabian Government and was sent on to the capital, Ryad, as at that time the ports were not able to communi cate rapidly with the capital. Now that several radio stations have been erected on the Mainland this traffic is almost ni1. The fact that a very small volume of traffic passes at present between Bahrein and Arabia does not however indicate that there is not sufficient traffic to warrant the opening up of a direct service. The reason for this traffic being so small is that the cost per word (Rs.4-6-0) is prohibitive and traffic is also subject to delay. The local merchants and the public in general find it much cheaper to send their messages to the Main land, only 40 miles away, by boat. Boats ply between Bahrein and the Mainland almost every day carrying cargo.* * * * (%Ob) 2. The opening up of a direct service will therefore not result in any diversion of existing traffic from the more expensive route. Practically 80 % of the merchandise intended for the Mainland passes through Bahrein so that all Arabian merchants have representatives here to look after their interests. I am also informed by Mr.Miller that all the machinery, etc. that will be needed by the Oil Company on the Mainland will pass through Bahrein and it would be of great convenience to them to be in direct and rapid communication with their agents here. 1 feel confident that in a short time after the establishment of a direct telegraph service to the Main land the volume of traffic dealt with would justify the maintenance of the service. it should be made clear tnat the opening of such a service would not involve the Company in any loss of revenue such.as might be caused by the diversion of traffic from a more expensive route. Should the rates of the direct route be cheap the public are sure to make good use of it. I understand that the rates for telegrams from the ports on the Mainland to any of the towns in the interior is about six annas or eight annas per word. The Arabian Stations work on wavelengths between 750 and 850 metres. These stations were erected by the Marconi Company and any information regarding them should be available to Head Office. It would be much appreciated by the Oil Company and the local merchants and public if the Company would take the matter up immediately with the Arabian Govern- me nt.i « f$&gt;\) 3..

Spark transmission is at present only used in the event of a breakdown of the C.W. transmitter here and its use will finally be discontinued when the new gear has been installed. We would suggest that the charges per word for messages to Oqair be the same as at present charged for messages to Sharjah, i.e. Fes 0.60. In the case of messages for places inland the additional inland charges at present ruling in Saudi will of course have to be added to this charge.

On the whole the line of approach suggested by Ryan in paragraph 7 of his despatch, No.214 of 7th July, seems the best, though Calvert might perhaps also, if that were thought desirable, be able to make some use of the fact that the Saudi oil concessionaires in Hasa have independently raised the matter with Cable and Wireless Limited. 3.

This Company would be willing to enter into an agreement with your Government for the exchange of telegrams between Arabia and Bahrein and, if your Govern ment is agreeable, wepropose that we work with your station at Oqair which is the nearest station to Bahrein. Our present coast charge at Bahrein is Fcs.0.60 (gold) and if your Government would agree to accept a similar charge at Oqair a rate could be arranged at Fes. 1.20 (gold). We would be very pleased to le arn the views of your Government in this matter and whether you would propose to make additional charges for the transmission of telegrams to places in Arabia beyond Oqair.I spoke to Mr. Christopher Warner about this and he agreed that it would probably be possible for Mr. Calvert at Jedda forthwith to approach the Saudi Government on the basis of the information already available to him without any further specific statement of their proposals from the Company. I said I would ascertain from the Company whether they had as yet taken any action and let them know that the Minister had now advised that it would probably be better for a first mention of their readiness to take action in the matter to be made to the Saudi authorities through the Legation. If the Saudis displayed a readiness to take matters further, the technical details could then be arranged direct between them and the Company, the Legation dropping outi V * FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. — -sL-Oth-rAug-u &amp;t, 1934. 4-Qth' Augu&amp;t, 1934.

You have of course already told the Company in your letter under reference that His Majesty’s Government think it preferable that the Company should approach the Saudi Government direct in the matter. The arguments contained in paragraph 7 of Ryan’s despatch have led us to reconsider our original view and we think that, if you agree, the Company might J. G. Laithwaite, Esq.te told that we are now in favour of the Legation at Jedda broaching the matter with the Saudi Government in the first place, to prepare the way, if the Saudis agree to the proposal in principle, for discussions between the Company and the competent Saudi authorities. 3.

You will remember that on the 30th January, 1932 the late Political Resident in the Persian Gulf addressed to me a telegram No. T / 28 regarding the anxiety then expressed by Ihn Sa’ftd to establish telephonic communication between Nejd and the outer world by wireless via Bahrain* X wrote a personal letter on the subject to Mr. Bendel on the 2nd February 1932, explaining the difficulty of taking any action here and drawing attention to the question whether the establishment of such communication could be held to violate Article six of the Working Agreement regarding the Port Sudan- Jedda cable. I find no further correspondence on that particular subject in my files but, if I remember rightly, I discussed the matter with the Eastern Department when in England. 3. The telegram referred to in the preceding paragraph was sent just after the Resident had visited Ibn Sa’ud at Hufuf. My records of his discussions with the King and Sheykh Yusuf YAsln The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.G.V.O., etc., etc., etc.Yaeln do not, however, contain any reference to telephonic communication# They refer to the King’s desire to have telegraphic and postal communication between Hesa end the outer world# In the event arrangements were made for postal communication by arrangement with the Government of India, but, so far as I know, the question of telegraphic communication was not pursued. 4. I do not myself see any definite political objection to the establishment of the service now suggested. n the other hand I am impressed by Colonel Loch’s view that if established, it would be preferable that it should be in the hands of the Saudi Government and Imperial and International Communications Limited rather than that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company should be in a position to press any claim to establish a service of their own. 5. In this connection it is of interest to consider the present position of the oil companies in this matter. Article 19 of the published Hasa Concession authorises the concessionary to use w any means of communication”. This does not necessarily mean that they are entitled to create their own means of communication and indeed the Diary of the Political Agent at Bahrain for the period 16th October to the 30th November 1933 mentions a report that the Standard Oil Company’s geologists had been refused permission by Ibn Se’tid to erect their own wireless sets. On ifc# other hand Article 6 of the draft Kuwait Concession, enclosed in your printed despatch No. 120 (E 1739/160/91) of the 22nd March, contemplates the establishment of wireless and telegraph services by the Kuwait Oil Company Limited and Article 3 of the proposed concession for the Kuwait Neutral Zone contains a similar provision. ( See enclosure in your despatch 234 ( E 3575/4/26 ) of the 13th June )• As His Majesty's Government have given their blessing to the former draft and the Saudi Government seem inclinedinclined to accept the latter, it might be difficult for either to discountenance indefinitely in their respective spheres the establishment of a service by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, if that Company were insistent and could not be told that the provision had been made for wireless communication between Hese end the outer world. 6. I fear that the preceding paragraphs cover ground most of all of which has probably been already examined in London but it is necessary to go over it to justify my support of the conclusions of the Political officers in the Persian Gulf in favour of promoting the establishment of the communication by arrangement between the Saudi Government and Imperial and i International Communications Limited. 7. As regards the procedure, T am normally in favour of leaving commercial interests to approach the Saudi Government direct. In the present instance, however, I consider that Ibn Band’s reaction, which may in any case be one of suspicion, would on the whole be less suspicious, if he were approached by Hie Majesty's Government from the starting point that he had himself raised the question with Colonel Biscoe in 1952 and that the creation of a service at Bahrain by Imperial and International Communications Limited ( ^or the enlargement of their service, if they as well as Imperial Airways formerly had installations ) now enabled His Majesty's Government to pursue the matter. If he welcomed the suggestion the details would doubtless have to be arranged with the Company but, if the latter themselves took the first action, he might imagine that His Majesty's Government were using them to obtain some ulterior object of their own. He is well aware of the closeness of the connection between the Company and His Majesty's Government. 8.

All the Departments concerned now agree with the Resident that it would be desirable that such communication should be established by I.&amp; l.c. On the question of the channel through which the approach to the Saudi Government, etc. is to be made, the Foreign Office favour a direct approach by the Company, who, if they find difficulty in conducting negotiations with the Saudi authorities themselves, could approach the Inula Office or Foreign Office. Hie question has been raised with the Political Agent, Bahrein, not only by Imperial Airways, but also by the Qificer-in-Charge of the l.&amp; l.c. station there. 2&lt; If you agree, I suggest that, now that inter departmental agreement has been reached, I might ask Captain/U vu., - 2 - Captain Lawson of I.&amp; I.C. to come and see me, explain the position, say that there is no objection from our point of view to the Company approaching the Sheikh of Bahrein ana the Saudi Arabian Government, and confirm this subsequently in writing.SECRET 2 jJt.jT£s.A.L. 26th June, 1934.

Prom Lieut, Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrein. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter No. C/557-17/4 dated the 3rd December, 1933, regarding the desire of Imperial Airways Limited to establish connection between their Wireless station at Bahrein and Stations in Saudi Arabia, and to enclose a copy of a letter dated the 6 th April, 1934, from the Officer- in-charge, Imperial and International Communications Limited, making a similar proposal. 2. I have informed the Officer-in-charge that I an referring the matter to you. 3. I understand that Imperial and International Communications Limited are about to take over the wireless work of the Royal Air Force and of Imperial Airways Limited. 4. I am not in a position to judge of the rate proposed, but if Rs.0-7-0 a wold represents only the share of Imperial and International Communications Limited, the rate seems somewhat high from the user f s point of view. 5. The establishment of this wireless service is likely to prove a very mixed blessing from the political point of view, but would, if there is a real demand for it, be difficult to prevent. 6 . Such communication would, on the other hand, be of distinct value in case of forced landings by aircraft of the Royal Air Force or Imperial Airways Limited. 7. There is, however, a further consideration of great importance. If there is no wireless communicationbetween B&amp;b.i*ein &amp;nd Saudi Arabi &amp; 9 it would oe difficult to v/ithstand a request from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to be permitted to communicate messages by their own wireless or wireless telephones to the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited in Bahrein for onward transmission. In a conversation in December, 1903, the Geologist -in-cnarge (Mr. Miller) of the Hasa exploration ashed me whether the Agent of Imperial Airways Limited had mentioned the question of wireless communication with Saudi Arabia to me and emphasised its importance, so that such a request from the Company is not unlikely, if a regular service is not established. 8 . I think, therefore, that it v/ould be wise to support the proposal of Imperial and International Communica tions Limited on the ground that it is most important that communications between Bahrein and the mainland should be in the hands of a British Company. I have, etc. , (Signed) G. LOCH, Lieut. Colonel. Political Agent, Bahrein.Copy of a letter dated 6 th April, 1964, from the Officer-in- Charge, Imperial and International Cotmaimications Limited, Baiirein, to the Political Agent, Bahrein. The question of opening up a Radio Telegraph service between Bahrein and the country of Saudi has been under the consideration of our Head Office in London, as it is thought that such a service employing comparatively cheap rates would attract a fair volume of traffic. It has been suggested that in order to facilitate the exchange of traffic between the two places, our station at Bahrein should worn to the Saudi station of Oqair, which would further distribute traffic to the other towns of Saudi if necessary 0 The choice of the station to which we should work would, of course, rest with the Government or Saudi and depend on their existing internal arrangements for the distribution of traffic. I have been requested to enquire from the Saudi Government through the Political Agent at Bahrein, what charges would be acceptable to them for message to Oqair and places beyond.

Dear Laithwaite Y/ith reference to your letter of the 6th of Jura to Commander Clarke on the subject of wireless communication between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia, we see no objection to Cable and Wireless Limited's station at Bahrein undertaking communication with Saudi Arabia or to the Company making the necessary arrangements direct with the Saudi Telegraph Administ ration. I notice that the Political Agent at Bahrein in his letter of the 7th of April 1934 said that the Company's proposed charge of 60 gold centimes a word as their share seemed high from the user's point of view, in the absence of full information as to the cost of the service and the probable volume of traffic, it is difficult to form a definite opinion on this point, but the charge does not seem 1^0 us to be excessive having regard to the probable conditions.

Prom:- Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch,I.A*, Political Agent, ligwu-v, Bahrain. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter No:C/5S7-17/4 dated the 3rd December 1U33 regarding the desire of Imperial Airways Limited to establish connection between their Wireless Station at Bahrain and Stations in Sa^di Arabia, and to enclose a copy of a letter dated the 6th April 1^34 from the Officer-in- charge, imperial &amp; International Communications Limited,aaJcing a similar proposal. 2. I have informed the Oliicer-in-charge that I am referring the matter to you. 3. I understand that the Imperial &amp; International ^ammunications Limited are about to take over the wireless work oi the iioyal Air Force and of Imperial Airways Limited. 1 am not in a position to judge of the rate proposed, but if Rs.0-7-0 a word represents only the share of the Imperial &amp; International Communications Limited, the rate seems somewhat high from the user T s point of view. 5. The establishment of this wireless service is likely to prove a very mixed blessing from the political point of view, but would, if there is a real demand lor it, be dilficuit to prevent. Sucn communication would, on the other hand, be of /distinctdistinct value in case of forced landings by aircraft of the Royal Air Force or Imperial Airways Limited. 7. There is, however, a further consideration of great importance. If there is no wireless communication between Bahrain and Sa ? udi Arabia, it would be difiicult to withstand a request from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to be permitted to communicate messages by their own wireless or wireless telephones to The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited in Bahrain for onward transmission. In a conversation in December 1^33,the Geolegist-in-charge (Mr.Miller) of the Rasa exploration asked me whether the Agent of Imperial Airways Limited had mentioned the question oi wireless communication with Sa’udi Arabia to me ana emphasised its importance,so that such a request from the Company is not unlikely,if a regular service is not established. 3. I think, therefore, that it would be wise to support the proposal of the Imperial &amp; International Communications Limited on the ground that it is most important that communi cations between Bahrain ana the mainland should be in the hands of a British Company. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- G.Loch. Lieut-Colonei, Political Agent,Bahrain.Copy charge,Imperial and International Communications Limited, Bahrain,to the Political Agent, Bahrain. The question of opening up a Radio Telegraph Service between Bahrain and the country of Saudi has been under the consideration of our Head Oflice in London, as it is thought that such a service employing comparatively cheap rates would attract a fair volume of traffic. It has been suggested that in order to facilitate the exchange of traffic between the two places, our station at Bahrain should work to the Saudi station of Oqair, which would further distribute tralfic to the other towns of Saudi if necessary. The choice of the station to which we should work would, of course, rest with the Government of Saudi and depend on their existing internal arrangements for the distribution of traffic. I have been revested to enquire from the Saudi Government through the Political Agent at Bahrain, what charges would be acceptable to them lor messages to Oqair and places beyond. Our Company propose that our share on such trailic should be Gold Franc O.bO per word. This is at present equivalent to Ks.0-7-0 only. We snail be obliged if this iniormation could be furnished as early as conveniently possible, and snail be pleased to furnisn any information tnat may be required by the Saudi Government in connection with the establishment of the service between Bahrain and their country.

CONFIDENTIAL. rs [E 3298/1492/25] ITz7' 4271 1933 TiTT June 21, 1933. Section 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 21.) (No. 156.) Sir, Jedda, May 26, 1933. I AM reporting in a separate despatch on the commercial position in regard to the wireless installation supplied to the Saudi Government by the Marconi Company in 1931—32. As there has been some confusion in earlier reports, ending with Mr. Hope Gill s printed despatch No. 70 of the 3rd March, as to the distribution of the wireless stations now in operation in this country, I take the opportunity of giving an up-to-date statement. The previous confusion has been due to departures from the plan made in 1931 and to a certain amount of transference of the older sets which were already in existence when the Marconi contract was concluded. Even now it is difficult to obtain exact information on all points, but I believe the list given in the following paragraph to be as accurate as possible subject to the observations in the subsequent paragraphs. It is based on the Saudi Government’s list enclosed in Mr. Hope Gill s despatch No. 70 of the 3rd March, on a list which appeared almost simultaneously in the l mm-al- Qura of the 24th February and on information from other sources. 2. The following is my consolidated list: — New Marconi Stations — 6 kilowatt: Mecca and Riyadh. \ kilowatt, fixed : Buraida, Hail, Hasa (Hofuf), Jedda, Jubail. Qaf (Qariyat), Qatif and Tabuk. \ kilowatt, mobile : Uqayr, Dawadmi, Taif and one set to accom pany the King. Other stations, provided with old Telefunken sets, available for tele graphy only, with the exception of one old Marconi set:— Abha, Al-Ula, (?) Dhaba, Jizan, Lith, Medina, Qunfida, Rabigh. (?) Sabya, Skaka (Jauf), Wejh and Yanbu. 3. The above list accounts for all the sets provided for in the Marconi contract, with the exception of one \ kilowatt fixed set. Mr. Philby tells me that this was erected at Riyadh before the large station was built and that it is still there. 4. Mr. Philby also states that the set at Uqayr has been dismounted from its lorry and thereby converted into a fixed set. The station at Dawadmi takes the place of that which was contemplated at Shaara. Dawadmi is, according to the Handbook of Arabia, 409 miles from Mecca on the road to Riyadh and 15 miles beyond Shaara. 5. In the list of older sets, I have marked Dhaba and Sabya as doubtful. The former is included in the list enclosed in Mr. Hope Gill's despatch No. 70 of the 3rd March, but not in the list published at the same time in the llmm-al- Qura. The former list makes no mention of Sabya, but it is included in the Umm-al-Qura list. 6. The Umm-al-Qura list shows Lith as having a station available both for telegraphy and telephony. This is probably the one old Marconi set, as Lith is known to have been supplied from Qunfida, which was formerly credited with a set of this type. There is, however, some obscurity as to the rearrangement since 1930 of the pre-existing stations. 7. Mr. Philby tells me that the station at Jizan was put out of action during the rebellion in Asir last winter. He speaks of it as requiring a new engine, but my own impression is that it must have been already repaired, as Jizan is a crucial point. [823 x—1]2 8.

Sir, The dsvelopment of* wireless communication in the Hejaz has formed the subject of a series of despatches from this Legation, of which the last was my printed letter No. 481 of December 12th. I will now summarize the position reached. 2. The following stations are actually in operation Name. Tyne of Set. Call Sign, (a) Old ^irkish Installation:?. Jedda Telefunkon Rabigh do. Medina do. Yanbu’ do. V r e jh do. Al ’Ula do. Hail do. Skaka do. Ah ha (Jebel ’Asir) do. Jisan do. Qunfida Old Marconi Najd (h) New Marconi Installations . Riadh . fStationary i KW) (2 Mobile do.) BuraIda Stationary do. Tabuk do. do. Hofuf Mobile do. The station at Skaka in the above list has recently been transferred there from «iauf, when Skaka became the Head- ouarters of the district /mlr. 3./ His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of* State for Foreign Affairs.3. The construction of the new M&amp;rconi stations has not proceeded very ranidly. The original contract made by the He,iaz-re f id ftovernment with the Marconi Company in 1930 provided as you are aware, for two 6-K 1 '/ stations, at Mecca and Kiadh, nine - 2 -id? stations and four mobile sets. Most of the material had arrived by t * r une of last year, as had Mr. Boucicault, Marconi's capable English engineer, and Kurdy Bey, their Egyptian engineer. In nine months the big Riadh station has not been begun, and Kurdy Bey is only now making a start on the Mecca one which is being built close to ibn Sa’ud's palace and connected to it by land line. Of the -? KW stations, only those at Buraida (the chief town of the Qastm district), Tabuk, and Riadh have been completed, (this last station will be moved elsewhere when the 6 KW is working), leaving the stations at Qat, Hail., Sha rah, and the four Hasa^district stations of J 5 .a^.r, Qauii and tTubail still to instal • The mobile sets have been planted at Hofuf (the chief town of the Hasa district), Taif, and Riadh, and there used as fixed stations, in which canacity their little 2^ h.n. air-cooled Douglas engines have given exceptional service, in spite of the hard k and 1 la—usage t.o which che native ooerators have subjected them. One of the two mobile sets at Riadh will shortly be moved to Duwadimi (close to Sha’rah), 4. For the slowness of this development the Hejazi Government must be held primarily responsible. Since last June .he material nas been at the Various ports of the kingdom and the two Marconi engineers have been ready to work at full pressure. But neither transport for the one nor stores for the other, could be obtained. Kurdy Bey has in the last nine months completed two ■§• KW stations; Mr. Boucicau.lt, who left Jedda in August* has completed only one, (that st Tabuk), and for the rest of the time has remained a voice crying in the wilderness for petrol. The King has recently tried to oidor hum to oho Hasa coast to make a start on the stations■sh.ere, but be is reported to have escaped to Damascus and to be disinclined to return. Meanwhile, since August last none of the monthly instalments of £1000 towards the cost; oi the material has been paid by the He^az-We^d G-cvernnient. 5- Ibn Sa '(id, who has throughout been personally concerned in the enterprise, is now finding flaws* The 6 F.w sets., when eventually completed, will of course be capable of considerable range and of caressing all Arabia with her master’s voice as well as of reaching Cairo, Baghdad, Khartoum and even ind 2 .a by telegraphy. But the £ kw sets, although designed for telephonic as well as telegraphic communication, have a safe range of not more than 500 miles for the voice and 700 miles by te .egraphy. All stations moreover are single-aerisled &gt; and His Majesty is finding conversation with his scattered henchmen somewhat tedious owing to the nsceseity of closing down the transmitter and tuning in the receiver, and vice- versa, in order to listen and to speak. I learn that the roya~ patience is proving unequal to the strain of waiting for loyal answers to the royal word. The state of mind of the tribesman at the other end of the ether may be better imagined than described. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to Elhi, C^iro, Khartoum, Jerusalem, Baghdad, Bushire, and Aden* I have, etc., (signed) G.GHOEE GILL. PoOo since writing the above, i learn that Mr. Bcucieault must have completed the Qaf station before leaving for Damascus*Extract from note by Sir A. Ryan on discussions at Amman on February 12 and 13 between himself and Colonel Cox, assisted by Mr. Kirkbride, Peake Pasha and Captain Glubb. (f) I said I was anxious to know the position as regards wireless communication in view of the fact that Ibn Zeid would not be given substantial powers by Ibn Saud but might be able to negotiate with Captain Glubb without undue delay if he could hear His Master's Voice by wireless. Captain Glubb stated that the erection of the Marconi station at QAF was well advanced, if indeed it had not been completed since he last had news of it. Pending its erection there had been no wireless communication across the frontier, as it was easier to communicate with Ibn Zeid at QAF by other means rather than by wireless through the JAIJF station, now removed to SKAKA. Once the QAF station was functioning there would be nothing to prevent the exchange of messages across the frontier. He himself, hov/ever, does not move about the desert with a mobile set and can only communicate by wireless at posts.TKF/.SAa fron the Politiuu Kesidnnt for Persian (Julf to the °ecret.»ry oi 'tate for the Colonies„ (Dated 30th January 193g. received.

With reference to ay printed letter No. 418 of the 3i«t October regarding the progreee of the Marconi wireless Installations in this ooontry, 1 have the honour to transmit herewith a further extract from the n 8ma-al-. )ura' # which states that the new station at H&amp;il is now functioning# £• If llaroonl's Egyptian engineer^ who has recently completed the Mralda station and is now in Jodda, Is to bo bollsved however, no work at all has yet been done at H&amp;ll; possibly an original Turkish plant Is being ops rated. 3. It Is also learned from this engineer that, when he began to inspect the site for the HiSdh station, the Rejdl Ulama raised suoh opposition that Ibn iJa f €d conrened them, and having surrounded them with troops harangued them. He olaimed to be as good a Moslem as they, yet he did not consider wireless telegraphy to be work of the devil; any who took a different view would lose his head. 4.

Sir, With reference to Mr. Bond's despatch No.69 of March 20 last on the subject of wireless communication within the territories of Hejaz-Nejd, I have the honour to report that in conversation on August 30th the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that it was intended to give a contract to M^rooni's Wireless Telegraph Comrany, limited, for nineteen stations, as follows:- 3 main 5-Kilowatt stations - Mecca Riyadh and The Hasa (? at Uqair) 3 3-Kilowatt sub-stations - Hail Jauf and Qaryat (Kaf) 7 small 1-Kilowatt stations- Qatif Jubail and 5 others and six mobile J-Kilowatt posts. 2. This information is probably correct in substance but may be inaccurate in detail, of which Fuad Hamsa did not seem to have a perfectly clear grasp. 3. His chief object in imparting it was to seek the help of His Majesty's Government with a view to checking the Marconi Company's specifications of the equipment necessary for these osts. I explained in vain that a company like Marconi's might be trusted to deal fairly and to supply only what was necessary and that it would, moreover, hand over the stations in working order if the contract were suitably drawn. Oriental suspicion, probably Ibn Sa'ud's, remained dominant• \ His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.4* In these circumstances and prorided you see no objection, I shall be grateful if I may be supplied with such detail of 1, 3 and 5-Eilowatt equipment as would be submitted by the Marconi Company to, and acceptable by, the Crown Agents for the Colonies, for instance, for use in similar conditions as obtain in Arabia, I hare, etc., (Signed) C.G.

Sir, We have the honour to infom you of a wireless scheme for Arabia which we have submitted to the King of the Hedjaz, Ibn Saud. The proposed scheme includes the provision of two main wireless stations at Mecca and Riyadh and ten subsidiary V s \/ V- ^ ✓ stations at Kaf, Jauf, Hail, Sha 1 ra, Shaqra, Suraida, Uquair, Jubail, Qatif and HUfuf. The equipments will be used for the conduct of telegraph and telephone services throughout Arabia. All our negotiations are being conducted through Messrs.

A fuller appreciation of the position would be that whilst Cable and Wireless Ltd. possess sole communication rights in Bahrain (with the exception of those temporarily ceded to the Oil Companies) international communications with Saudi Arabia can be handled over the notified wireless circuit operated by the Company with the Saudi Arabian Government. Most of the international traffic with Saudi Arabia is however in Arabic,and the Bahrain-Alkhobar circuit concerned handles only Arabic morse. The Saudi Arabian Government of course control the wireless stations operating in Saudi Arabia and the granting of rights in that country to other parties (in this case the Oil Companies) is their prerogative. We feel sure, however, that the Political Resident knows the true position, and maybe his comment to the U.S. press correspondent was not so limited as his despatch suggests. tvi. u»oC OaF ILEiM I AL ^,Q&gt; No, 306-£ tjj'v *4 iv HlA.; a’ijLi-' w x.. * .AA , catec the 3rc Aebruar^ 1948.

The stipulation about not accepting third party traffic was inserted to protect the rights of Cable and Wireless ltd* in Saudi Arabia and Bahrein* The provision for exceptions at the discretion of the Political Agent, Bahrein was one of the conditions of the original (191*2) agreement and oas inserted at the request of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (his telegram Ho*932 of 23 May, 19^2) to cover emergency faessages e*g. in case or aircraft crashes* It was agreed by the India Office on the assumption that the Political Agent would as a general rule only authorise such messages cn specific request from the Service Authorities and the Secretary of State asked for periodical reports by airmail giving particulars of all cases where such authorisation had been given* *■% It was pointed out at that time (i.e. 13*2) that this arrangement would only be satisfactory if the emergency originated at the Bahrein end and to cover messages originating at Stmhran it was subsequently agreed that the Oil Company* s Resident ^Manager at Dhahran could give the necessary authority provide^provided he reported subsequently to the Politloal Agent at Bahrein, .^1 though not specifically carried over to the 1^6 Agreement the understanding no doubt continues* 3ii September, toe U«S* Consul, applied for permission to use the Oil Companies* radiotelephone link between Bhahran and Bahrein'^ °f S^tenber, ^ pditioal Reaidmt, t, siai iilf )• The Political Resident suggested that this would be against the interests of Cable and wireless, who, he stated, provided ^.°J®^ roial wireless oconunication between Bahrein and Hofuf on the tuainland and that permission should be given to the U.S, Consul only P ^° e9 ‘ , ^ India * Ottioe, in Foreign Office letter V 1 Jfc 6 a/! 47 V 801 ^ 2 October, 1944, We are ascertaining how satisfactory or otherwise this particular channel Bahrein - Hotfhf (operated by Ssodi-Arabia) is, the facts do not m^jport the American contention given in paragraph 2 of your letter to Mr, Harrison dated 17th November, 1947*1 It appears that if the Senators* message had been passed to the Oil ,hahran U#S * Coilsul as an emergency message, their Manapr could have authorised its transmission over the radio- telephone lank provided he subsequently notified the Political Agent, As regards regular oanaunication facilities between Dhahran and aiire-Ui, the Arabian American Oil Company** international telegraph * r *~*j c carried by launch between the mainl and anA Bahrein.

Senators messa ;e# 2. Manager Bahrain Petroleum Company reports that he has been unable to trace any such message haviny been received by any of his organisation and that ^rabian American Oil Company can find no record of .any such message having been despatched. He assumes that there must have been some 'slip-up' in the American Consulate at Bhahran.regarding restrictions on communications between Dhahran and Bahrein. 2. The United States Embassy have now passed on to us such further information as they have been able to obtain from the Senators. It appears that they wished to send an urgent message to Damascus announcing their impending arrival there and asked the United States Consul at Dhahran to send it off as soon as possible. He apparently asked the Arabian-American Oil Company to telephone the message to the Bahrein Petroleum Company for despatch by Cable and Wireless. The telegram could not be sent because Cable and Wireless are not allowed to transmit messages received in this way without the approval of the British 'political representative' (presumably the Political Agent is meant) and he could not be found. 3. The Senators were yesterday still in a state of considerable indignation at what they regard as an injustifiable restriction on United States Government communications and the Foreign Secretary when he saw them undertook to look into the question. F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relation Office. /4. We should therefore he grateful if you would now inform the Political Resident hy telegram of the further details given by the Senators and ask him if he would try to find out exactly what happened to the^S message in question.. It looks as if somebody in the Bahrein Petroleum Company^ office or if not in Cable and Wireless should know about it; and Bahrein Petroleum Company could no doubt if necessary find out by telephone what happened from the Arabian American Oil Company. 5* On receipt of his reply we shall then have to consider the question of the United States Consul' at Dhahran’s communications facilities. It seems at first sight odd, and extremely difficult to justify to the Americans, that whereas a message of his which is sent by launch from Dhahran to Bahrein could be sent to them by Cable and Wireless without any fuss, a message which is sent by the emergency procedure over the Companies telephone needs the priorepproval of the Political Agent. We appreciate that the telephone is intended for the Companies r business only and is not intended for use by the general public but there does seem to be a case for giving the United States Consul special facilities for the United States Government’s business. 6.

A reduction in the rates of charge from Muscat, Bahrein and Saudi Arabia to this country and to the United States has been under the Company’s consideration for some time. The introduction of these reduced rates has, however, been postponed at the request of His Majesty’s Government in view of other considerations. We have now heard from the Foreign Office that its former views have been ixdified and it would like us to go ahead with our pro posals.

(For telegrams originating in Saudi Arabia, Bahrein and Muscat sterling equivalents will not be identical because we understand that the rate of collection in Saudi Arabia is on a full gold basis whereas in Bahrein and Muscat it is calculated at sterling plus one-third).

Our information had been that Cable and Wireless could meet and were now meeting all reasonable /jnerican military requirements. We had no wish to exclude American influence from Saudi Arabia, but we had to give proper protection to important British Commercial Company of great strategic value. Both Americans expressed conviction that developments in the oilfields would be such that in five years time Cable and Wireless would be making much larger profits even if direct radio telegraphic connexion with the United States were installed. They made the further point that their military communica tions department were technically far ahead of commercial practice. American military headquarters in the field were able to get almost immediate contact with Washington. Implication was that it was unreasonable for us to deny installation of similar facilities between iimerican interests in Saudi Arabia and their headquarters in the United States. Both said specifically that it was not exclusively a question of military operational needs. They said that Mr. Stettinius hoped that the Secretary of State would be able to look into this subject when he got back to London. Please repeat to Jedda. [Repeated to Jedda under No. 202]. O.T.P.

United States Minister has informed the Saudi Arabian Government that : (a) United States Government is asking His Majesty 4 s Government not to oppose any measures the Saudi Arabian Govern ment may take towards establishing direct radio circuits with the United States. (b) Proposal is not aimed at special privilege for the United States but serves the policy of the open door and thus removes restrictions which handicap normal development of timely enterprises in Saudi Arabia. (c) In view of the large scale developments in the economy of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Arabian Government can scarcely afford to have its economic and transport development hampered by monopolistic arrangement which does not respond to the country s needs, can be revised only at five yearly intervals, and imposes' exorbitant rates. (d) The step proposed commits the Saudi Arabian Government to nothing but merely carries out the intention previously announced to the British and American Governments /and defines- 2 - and defines an amendment explicitly provided for in terms of the agreement. 4. United States Minister has pressed for action before the erniration on June 1st of the final six months of the five 9 year period? This time limit for action after notice • for modification may be tidy and convenient but does not appear obligatory under the terms of the agreement. 5.
