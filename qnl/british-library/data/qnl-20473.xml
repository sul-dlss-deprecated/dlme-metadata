[July 9.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 11. [31489] No. I. India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received July 9.) Sir, India Office, July 8, 1913. WITH reference to my letter of the 26th June, and to the counterdraft of an article providing for extradition arrangements with Turkey which has since been proposed by Hakki Pasha, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to inform you that he is unwilling to agree to any further concession in this matter. I am to observe that no trouble appears to have arisen in the past between Turkey and Koweit in regard to extradition, and that the position of Turkey in this respect will in no way be weakened by the convention. On the other hand, the Marquess of Crewe regards with grave misgiving any arrangement which will furnish material for the mischievous activity of the Turkish agent. In this connection I am to enclose copy of a letter from the political agent at Koweit which has been received by this mail, and from which it will be seen that the sheikh is greatly perturbed at the recognition by His Majesty's Government of a right on the part of Turkey to send an agent to Koweit. It is superfluous at this stage to discuss the views of the sheikh and of Major Shakespear, but it is obviously desirable that the legitimate functions of the Turkish agent should be as few as possible. Lord Crewe would therefore suggest that Hakki Pasha should be informed that His Majesty's Government must adhere to their own proposal. And in any case the offences for which extradition is desired should be limited to grave crimes only, and should not include del its. I have, &amp;c. T. W. HOLDERNESS. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Government of India. (Confidential.) Bushire, June 7, 1913. WITH reference'to my telegram dated the 27th May, 1913, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter which has since been received from the Political Agent, Koweit, with regard to the attitude of Sheikh Sir Mubarak-bin-Subah towards the articles of the Anglo-Turkish Convention concerning Koweit. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Captain Shakespear to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox. (Confidential.) Koweit, May 28, 1913. WITH reference to correspondence regarding the Anglo-Turkish negotiations anent the status of Koweit, ending with your second assistant's endorsement, dated the 20th May, 1913, and in accordance with your instructions, I have conveyed verbally to Sheikh Sir Mubarak-bin-Subah a general idea of the trend of the agreement about to be concluded between the British and Turkish Governments. 2. I visited the sheikh on the day following the receipt of your instructions and was careful to dwell upon the efforts which His Majesty's Government had made to secure above all things the autonomy of Koweit, an acknowledgment of our special relations with its ruler, the recognition as far as possible of the boundaries claimed by the sheikh and his more practical interests such as a definite pronouncement reerardine: [2985 i—ll]his authority over adjacent islands and the nearer Bedouin tribes, the prohibition of any interference by the Porte in Koweit's domestic or foreign questions, the exclusion of Turkish troops from Koweit territory, and the admission of the sheikh's right to the undisturbed enjoyment of his properties on the Shatt-el-Arab. However, as no negotiations could be conducted without a certain amount of give and take, it had been found necessary apparently, in order to obtain these solid advantages, to give way on some points of detail to avoid wounding Turkish susceptibilities and it was therefore probable that the Turkish posts at Safwan and Umr Kasr would continue, whilst the recognition of Turkish suzerainty would be likely to entail a demand by the Porte for the residence of a Turkish representative in Koweit. The sheikh heard me patiently enough, occasionally interjecting a shrewd question as to exactly what might be involved by an acceptance of Turkish suzerainty. In reply, I gave the analogy of Egypt, where the Khedive, though nominally a Turkish Viceroy and a subject of the Sultan, enjoyed British protection and was for all practical purposes quite independent of the Porte, who had no word in his internal administration, the collection of revenue, and the like. 3. The sheikh rather resented the continuance of the posts at Safwan and Umr Kasr, but when I explained that we were endeavouring to secure the recognition of his boundary as touching these places and that the permanent location of half-a-dozen Turkish soldiers in a mud fort at these points really made no practical difference, he seemed inclined to agree. His attitude, however, was quite different when I intimated that recognition of Turkish suzerainty might entail the reception of a Turkish agent in Koweit, as such was actually the case in Egypt. The sheikh was so surprised at the possibility that he asked me to repeat and explain the matter to him more than once, and when I had done so, he became most vehement in his opposition to the idea. He begged me to telegraph at once intimating his refusal to accept any Turkish official under any guise whatever in Koweit. He used all the arguments which I had anticipated in my letter of the 30th April, 1913 and finally said that the presence of one such official, for he knew from bitter experience what Turkish officials were, would destroy whatever good the proposed agreement might hold, would weaken his authority locally and in the adjacent desert, would lead to constant strife and the formation of parties among his people, whilst the Turkish agency would become a focus for domestic and foreign intrigue which would probably involve the British Government itself at no distant date in difficulties at present not to be foreseen. Having done my best to reassure the sheikh I left and despatched my first telegram to Fao. 4. On the following day the sheikh came to see me with particular reference to our conversation described above. I was surprised as he was not very well at the time and even if in good health he seldom returns an informal visit on the following day. He had evidently been considering what I had told him and had realised that, though his refusal to accept a Turkish official in Koweit might be sincere enough and couched in the most emphatic terms, he would be unable to persist in that refusal should the British Government have accepted the principle of representation and should the Porte demand its fulfilment. On this occasion the sheikh first reiterated his previous arguments, every whit as vehemently, then he pointed out that Colonel Meade's agreement of January 1899 was framed with the sole purpose of preventing what we ijow suggested as likely to come about, viz., the advent of foreign officials in Koweit. Further, we had expressly named the Turkish Government, as one it was particularly desirable to exclude from Koweit, in the lease agreement for Bander Shweikh, concluded in October 1907. Besides, at our suggestion he had repeatedly rejected German overtures though in doing so he was forfeiting the increase in his customs revenue which a German firm established in Koweit would undoubtedly have contributed. * He urged that he had faithfully observed his part of a bargain, which was now fourteen years old, and had agreed willingly to it, because he realised its advantages to himself as well to us, and all he desired was that the exclusion of foreigners might continue as heretofore. The sheikh then enquired what had been decided with regard to the Bagdad Railway, in reply to which I gave him the gist of what had appeared in the news telegrams, observing that I had no official confirmation. The sheikh evidently had at the back of his mind that his interests had been used by us in some bargain with the Turks, for he asked whether the settlement with the Porte only concerned Koweit and himself or other Gulf questions and the Bagdad Railway. I replied that T fancied probably an agreement had been reached on all questions, for that was indicated by the news telegrams, though what I had received from the Residency related only to Koweit. He was exceedingly perturbed by the idea of having to accept a Turkish official and reverted to the subject again and again saying there was no need to agree to that item,3 as the Turks were a beaten and weak nation now, apart from the fact that they never have had a representative in the place ; the only occasion on which they attempted to force one upon him, a quarantine official some years before the establishment of the British Political Agency, he had turned the man out summarily. He went on to point out that from what 1 had told him, he failed to see why any concession need have been made to the Porte, he was content to remain as he was, his authority in the desert could not be disputed by the Turks, he was not and never had been subject to them, his position as ' Ruler of Koweit and chief of its tribes ' was not disputed, and if the Turks liked to address him as ' kaimakam ' or by any other title, that did not alter the fact as he never so subscribed himself. He had the very strongest objections to the residence of a Turkish official in Koweit, and he begged me to telegraph again, placing a special boat at mv disposal for the despatch of the telegram. 5. I have given the conversations in some detail in order that the sheikh's attitude may be fully understood. To me his attitude is no surprise, and whenever the opportunity has occurred, I have endeavoured to present the local view, for it seemed important, seeing that these negotiations have been conducted without the sheikh having been given any idea as to their course, that we should avoid concessions of a nature likely or calculated to disturb our own relations with the sheikh and thereby affect our interests here detrimentally. In my letter of the 30th April, 1913, I attempted to forecast the manner in which the draft agreement of the 26th March was likely to be received and in the light of the sheikh's objections as now formulated, when for the first time he has been given some idea of the terms of the proposed agreement, I would invite a reference to the last three paragraphs of that letter. 6. Though I fear it is probably too late now to hope for any material alteration in whatever may be the terms of the final draft of the agreement, I feel compelled to record my conviction as to the probable effect of any agreement which does not contain most of the emendations I have already ventured to submit, and more especially which does not provide for the exclusion of Turkish officials from Koweit. There has been a growing tendency for some years on the part of Arabs to believe that the Christian Powers are determined to reduce Islamic nations to impotence, and the tendency has received no small impetus from the two wars in which Turkey has recently been engaged. The idea is rejected in the Egyptian press, it is encouraged in the Ottoman press, and is not absent from Mahommedan newspapers in India. So far as I have been able to ascertain, this idea has not yet crystalised generally into an accusation definitely anti-British, though indications in that direction have not been wanting; in Koweit the sheikh, more than any one else, has combatted anti-British notions of this kind, and has always held up the British Government as the onlv one which could be trusted to keep its word, deal even-handed justice, not to discriminate between the religious beliefs of its subjects, and not to oppress the weak. Nevertheless . the power which cheap newspapers, whose very names were unknown in Koweit ten years ago, can exercise on ignorant minds inclined to believe that all Arabic print is gospel is considerable, and I venture to think much underrated by us, who are in the habit of estimating at its true value what is purveyed by various organs, and the effect is undoubtedly noticeable in Koweit to-day. At the same time, there is not one Koweiti in a thousand who would prefer to be a Turkish rather than a British subject if he were now offered the choice. Most Koweitis have had sufficiently intimate dealings with Turks and their officials to thank God that their own ruler is, in fact, independent and under the protection of the British Government. I have had as much ^ expressed to me time and again, the moral being pointed frequently by a grateful reference to our action in past times in landing British blue-jackets for the defence of Koweit and in the summary dismissal of Turkish men-of-war when they appeared in Koweit harbour. Consequently local general opinion has accepted as a settled fact that Koweit is on the way eventually to become a British protected State similar to Bahrain ; that formal pronouncement of that position would probably be deferred until the death of Sheikh Mubarak, and that, all things considered, the position is about as good as could be secured, particularly as it would continue and confirm Koweit's present freedom from Turkish interference and the attentions of venal Turkish officials. 7. While the above may not appear germane to the Anglo-Turkish agreement, it may serve to show the general attitude of the people and the ruler, who axe the most nearly affected by that agreement. The agreement, as it stands in the draft, will in reality give nothing whatsoever to the Ruler of Koweit or his people which they have not enjoyed for years, while to them it will appear—owing to the clause permitting a resident Turkish agent—rather as a formal delivery of Koweit into the hands of Turkey by the Power which has hitherto safeguarded them from the menaces of that very r4 Power. I confess even I find it difficult to avoid some such conclusion when the a agreement contains clauses— (a.) Acknowledging Turkish suzerainty, hitherto disputed; {h.) Permitting a Turkish official in Koweit, hitherto strenuously opposed; (c.) Maintaining Turkish military posts, hitherto protested against as encroach ments ; [d.) Circumscribing boundaries hitherto unquestioned and actually maintained ; and (e.) Recognising the Ruler of Koweit as a Turkish official, hitherto denied. In the effort to reconcile the agreement, should it materialise as proposed, with the actually existing position, the sheikh and his people will ask themselves the inevitable question, ' what has induced the British Government to make this agreement concerning ^ us, so seriously to our detriment, and that, too, when Turkey is of no account in the world ? ' The answer locally is obvious, viz., that Koweit has been made use of by the British Government to obtain something else, a recognition of other claims elsewhere, a concession in regard to the Bagdad Railway, and the like. When it is remembered further that the Ruler of Koweit has not been consulted during the negotiations, has not been informed as to their course, and is to be presented with a fait accompli of some such description, I submit it is not unreasonable to expect the deepest disappoint ment and resentment at our action. How that resentment will aflect our future relations I am loathe to contemplate, but I feel sure that its effect will not be merely local—it will affect us along the whole Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf by shaking the confidence which our support has hitherto inspired. No amount of explanation will ever remove the impression that we have used Koweit as a pawn to secure other advantages for ourselves, more especially if some such advantages later become manifest, as, for instance, a settlement in our favour of the Bagdad Railway question. 8. It may be said I have exaggerated the probable disappointment and overrated its possible effect. It may be so, but with over four years' experience of Koweit, its ruler and its people, with whom the discussions of high politics on the mischievous lines supplied by the vernacular press occupies almost their whole leisure, I feel it to be my duty, even at this late hour, to endeavour to obtain some reconsideration of what appears to be almost a completed document, when that document seems calculated to destroy, with a stroke of the pen, a position which we have been at no small expenditure of energy and money to consolidate in Koweit, particularly, during the last ten years or more. -Exteact from Bahrain Political Diary No#34, dated Slot August 1913• (Received 5th September 1913)* i4 TURKISH-QATAR. 317.

[August 23.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [37990] No. 1. Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, Foreign Office, August 23, 1913. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a telegram, No. 411 of the 16th August, respecting the further concessions which Hakki Pasha desires to obtain from His Majesty's Government. It will be within the recollection of Sir Arthur Hirtzel that during the recent negotiations Hakki Pasha made a desultory remark to the effect that he supposed eventually the blue line, which is indicated on annex No. 5 a of the convention signed on the 29th July last, would be extended to the Aden boundary. Sir E. Grey is anxious, if possible, to confine the counter-concessions, which His Majesty's Government should request from the Ottoman Government in return for the further concessions which Turkey now desires, to commercial ones, but he is prepared, if the Secretary of State for India so desires, to make an attempt to get the Ottoman Government to agree to the line from the Ruba-al-Khaila being prolonged to the Aden boundary. There may be advantage in this, as possibly the Hadramaut and adjoining regions contain oil deposits, and, on the conclusion of an arrangement with France about Muscat, they might become places of refuge for the arms traffic, but before expressing any final opinion upon the question Sir E. Grey would be glad to be furnished, if possible at an early date, with the views of the Marquess of Crewe. I am, &amp;c. W. LANGLEY.

India Office, August 12, 1913. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Government of India to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox. (Telegraphic.) P. Simla, May 29, 1913. PLEASE advise what steps we should take to make the best of the new position in the El Katar Peninsula, which under the convention with Turkey will be enjoyed by us. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Lieutenant'Colonel Sir P. Cox to Government of India. Bushire, June 22, 1913. 1 HAVE the honour to reply to Foreign Department telegram dated the 29th May, asking my views as to the steps which can best be taken in order to enable us to obtain full advantage from the new position which we are acquiring in relation to the Katar Peninsula under the Anglo-Turkish Convention now on the point of conclusion. 2. At the moment, the subject is rendered a little complicated by an independent development, namely, the expulsion of the Turks from Ifasa and Katif and the assumption of the control of that province by Bin Saud. Meanwhile the Porte shows no sign of removing their garrison from A1 Bidaa, and indeed I doubt whether Sheikh Jasim would readily part with it at present, for in the absence of the Turkish garrison or of assurances from us to supply the place oi it, he would not unnaturally feel somewhat apprehensive of being absorbed by Bin Saud. For this reason I am inclined to think that another meeting with him at an early \ date is advisable, either on the part of the political agent, Bahrein, or myself, for the ^ purpose of explaining to him the gist of the Anglo-Turkish Convention so far as it concerns Katar and Bahrein, and in order to see what we are likely to get him to accept in the direction of closer relations with us. The inability to give him any reply on the subject of the arms traffic subsidy will be a little inconvenient, but I think it will be possible to make him understand that this matter is connected with our current neo-otiations with the French Government and that the consideration of it necessarily O takes a long time. It seems possible that the said negotiations with B ranee may have advanced some what in the last few weeks, and that the horizon may be clearer tor a consideration of the Katar question ; in any case, presuming that the convention with Turkey admits of it, it will probably be necessary to give Sheikh Jasim a subsidy in some form. 3. As soon as the ground is sufficiently prepared, I am of opinion that we should make a treaty with Sheikh Jasim by which we should recognise his autonomy, give him assurances of protection (so long as he observes his obligations to us) from attack by sea, and good offices to prevent unprovoked attack by land (by Bin Saud for instance) and should in return require from him undertakings under the following heads, so far as proves possible : [1825 n—5](1.) To receive an agent of the British Government of India at A1 Bidaa ; (for the present a Mohammedan a^ent of the type of residency agent at Lingah, working immediately under the political agent at Bahrein). (2.) To allow British Indians to reside in the Katar ports for trade, and to afford protection for their lives and properties. (3.) Not to levy duty at more than 5 per cent, ad valorem. (4.) To render co-operation generally for the preservation of the maritime truce, and in particular for the suppression of the slave trade, piracy, and the arms traffic. (5.) To issue a prohibition against the import or sale of arms and ammunition in Katar territory, except under special license. (6.) To undertake not to allow foreigners including British subjects, to acquire monopolies or concessions ; or to acquire pearling rights or use diving dresses in his waters, without the cognisance and approval of the British Government. (7.) Not to admit the agent of any Power other than Great Britain (and r l nrkey ?) and not to correspond with the officials of any other Power without the cognisance and concurrence of the British authorities. (8.) To receive and protect a British post office and telegraph installation (as at Kovveit and Bahrein) whenever the British Government consider that the step is needed. 4. It goes without saying that we should go slow in working for these desiderata, and that we could not expect to obtain them all at once, even in principle. It does not seem to me that any of the items are incompatible with the terms of the convention with Turkey, but this is a point for the consideration of higher authority. The first three neceesary steps seem to be to explain the situation to Sheikh Jasim and his son in charge of Doha ; to get rid of the Turkish garrison and then get our residency agent installed. I presume that His Majesty's Government will take steps to expedite the withdrawal of the garrison, as soon as the convention is finally accepted ; meanwhile the Government of India will perhaps feel able to authorise me to put the other two steps in hand, informing me at the same time whether any communication can be made to him with reference to my letter dated the 2nd March, 1913, on the subject of an arms traffic subsidy. 5. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the political agent, Bahrein, for his information and any observations he may wish to make.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] » ) *r [B] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [August 19.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 5. [38417] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office.—[Beceived August 10.) Sir, India Office, August 18, 1913. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of the correspondence regarding the attitude of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah towards the stipulations of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement that affect them. The Marquess of Crewe concurs in the views of the Government of India, and proposes, if Sir E. Grey approves, to instruct them accordingly. The Government of India have been asked if they recommend that the honorary rank of G.C.I.E. should be conferred upon the two Sheikhs, and, if they do, his Lordship would propose to make the announcement simultaneously with the publication of the Anglo-Turkish Agreements, the date of which I am to request may be communicated to this Office in good time. Sir E, Grey has already expressed to Sir P. Cox his appreciation of his successful negotiations with the Sheikhs. Lord Crewe notes with satisfaction the services rendered by the political officers at Koweit and Mohammerah. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HOLDERNESS. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. LieutenantrColonx^l Sir P. Cox to hidia Office. Sir, Bushire, July 13, 1913. IN amplification of my telegram dated the 9th July, 1913, I have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, a copy of the communication which I have addressed to the Government of India reporting my proceedings at Mohammerah in seeking compliance on the part of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah with our recommendations for their acceptance of the terms and results of the Anglo-Turkish Convention, now on the point of completion. I have, &amp;c. P. Z, COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty's Consul General for Fars, &amp;c. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Government of India. (Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, July 10, 1913. IN continuation of my telegram of the 9th instant, I have the honour to report in fuller detail what passed at my interviews with the Sheikhs of Koweit and Moham merah in connection with the Anglo-Turkish Convention. 2. I arrived at Mohammerah in H.M.S. ' Sphinx ' on the evening of the 4th instant, and was fortunate in finding Sheikh Mubarak still staying with the Sheikh of Moham merah. Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Koweit, had also arranged to rendezvous with me there. 3. On the morning of the 5th Major Haworth and I had a long interview with the Sheikh of Mohammerah alone. We read him a translation of the agreement regarding the frontier, as initialled, but described the course of it from its point of contact with the Khaiyin to the sea, as indicated by the line shown in the map, in emendation of the description given in the convention. Having to some extent forgotten the details of [1825 £—5] Bwhat passed at our interview with him of the 20th August, 1912, Sheikh Khazal was inclined to start old hares on the boundary line, such as the mid-channel theory ; but, on the whole, except for the necessity of travelling over the old ground again, we had little trouble in this connection. The Sheikh did not again raise the question ot the definition of ' connection' in reference to the relation of islands to the mainland at low water, while on the subject of Hakki Pasha's reservation in regard to the Khaiyin lands he was £urprisingly sensible—confident, no doubt, in the thought that, in view of established local facts, it has no concrete significance. 4. We then went on to deal with the question of the Riverain Commission, in which connection translations of such of the provisions of the convention as affect Mohammerah were read and explained to the Sheikh. He was very uneasy as to the probably troublesome results which might be expected to ensue from the control of the whole of the waters of the river, and vessels afloat thereon, by a Turkish Commis sion, and from the inevitable activities of its subordinate, employes. In discussing this problem he again raised the question of the mid-channel line, arguing that from the point where the Karun, a Persian river, joins the Shatt-el-Arab, it surely was only fair that Persia should share the possession of the river. But as Haji liais was not present on this occasion, and we had already been talking for over three hours and the Sheikh was getting tired, we were unable to dispose of the question of the Commission at this sitting, and therefore adjourned, leaving the translation with the Sheikh for further study and discussion with Haji liais, and with the intention of finishing with it at the Sheikh's return visit to me. Meanwhile—and, indeed, all along—the latter expressed his firm intention, after talking things out, to comply with our final advice in the matter. 5. Before parting company I asked him to arrange with his guest, Sheikh Mubarak, for me to visit him the following forenoon, and told Sheikh Khazal briefly what I had to say to the former. He himself took a sensible view of the question of the location of a Turkish agent, recognising its one convenient aspect, ie., as an indication of Sheikh Mubarak's autonomous position ; and he promised to endeavour to influence his friend in the right direction. 6. At Sheikh Khazal's visit to the consulate on the 7th, he was accompanied by Haji Rais, and they brought an old volume of treaties in Persian, containing the text of the Treaty of Erzeroum, relying on which they started the mid-channel question again. All the old ground had to be gone over again once more, but the Sheikh and his factotum were ultimately persuaded that the recognition of the Turkish claim to the whole river, as provided by the Treaty of Erzeroum, with the alternative of an appeal to The Hague, had been a necessary step in order to secure, in the Sheikh's own interests, the frontier that he wanted from the Duwairij southwards to the Khaiyin; and that no useful object would result from any attempt to reopen that question now. 7. This point having been finally disposed of, the question of the powers of the Riverain Commission and the delegation of Mohammerah interests to the care of the British commissioner was then gone into. We found that the right of the (Commission to deal with vessels in touch with the Persian Bank greatly exercised both the Sheikh and Haji Rais, especially in view of the wording of the sentence in the declaration stipulating that the functions performed by the commissioner supervising the interests of the Sheikh of Mohammerah must be discharged without prejudice to his quality as a member of the Turkish Commission. The Sheikh feared the contingency of the British commissioner, perhaps a stranger to himself, being over-influenced by his Turkish role, and perhaps led to act against Mohammerah interests arbitrarily without consulting its ruler. We endeavoured to persuade him that his apprehensions on this point were premature, and that the British commissioner would surely receive all such preliminary instructions from the British Government as might be necessary to ensure Mohammerah interests being really protected. Eventually we arranged in concert the draft of a letter of acceptance for the Sheikh to send me, and this he did in due course. I attach a translation thereof, and trust that the Sheikh's accompanying stipulation will not be considered inconvenient or unreasonable. After settling the terms of this draft we adjourned to other matters of business. I need not dilate upon the extreme importance of letting the Sheikh feel that the British commissioner will really be in sympathy with him and see that his interests are fully protected. To this end I would urge Government to be pleased to consider the expediency of putting forward for selection as British commissioner the names of officers conversant with the politics and, if possible, the languages of the Shatt-el-Arab region, as being likely to have a better chance of establishing confidence and sympathetic relations with the Sheikh.me 8. I now beg to turn to my dealings with the Sheikh of Koweit. Captain Shakespear and I interviewed him at Failiyeh on the Gth July, Sheikh Khazal being* also present. I took up the thread with Sheikh Mubarak from the point where the political agent had left it as reported in my telegram dated the -7th Alay. A translation of the articles of the convention dealing with Koweit, including the extradition clause, as framed in the Secretary of State's telegram of the 1 7th June alternative (2) was read to him. He demurred somewhat at the excision of Umm Kasr and Bafwan, but had apparently resigned himself to their loss, and as regards the rest of the. boundary he acquiesced in it practically without remark. In the remainder of the Koweit articles there were three points on which he had something to say :— (1.) The clause in article (2), providing for the location of a Turkish agent at Koweit. i &gt;» (2.) The use of the word ''khalaf' ('successor '), and not ' aolad —sons, m article 2. _ _ ^ • • i o (3.) The clause providing for the establishment of customs offices in article 8. It was item (1) with which the discussion which followed was mainly concerned, but it will be more convenient to dispose of (2) and (3) first. 9. As regards the question of terminology in (2), I was not positive off-hand what the Arabic word used in previous engagements with him was, but, without pursuing that point, it was explained to him that, as the Turks had expressly undertaken not to interfere in the succession, it seemed of little consequence whether this particular convention used the word 'successor' or some other cognate expression, as the question was one which rested between himself and us alone. Without the Arabic text it ^as difficult to say more on this point than what I have recorded above; but it is refeired to in the Sheikh's letter to me and my reply. It will be found that in the Shweikh Agreement the word ' sons' ('aolad') was not used as the Sheikh thought, but the word 'Mieirs' (' warasah '), and that we managed to fence with the dynastic issue then raised by the Sheikh. My written reply to the latter (Enclosure 4) leaves the question in the same position as did the Shweikh Agreement, and I shall be glad to know what further, if anything, His Majesty's Government would wish me to say to him. It might be worth while, if Sheikh Mubarak himself wishes it, that we should offer to &gt; recognise his successor—presumably-his son and deputy, Sheikh Jabr in his lifetime. This would probably set his mind at rest completely as regards his own succession, and lead him to forget or drop all further efforts to secure a permanent dynastic guarantee. I solicit telegraphic orders on this point. The customs clause (3), at which he at once called a halt, brought us on to somewhat delicate ground, but it seemed to me that the best line to take was that the article discussed contingencies which might never take shape, so that in any case it seemed premature to come to issue over them now. We went on to explain that, if the railway did eventually come to Koweit, it would obviously be unreasonable for him to expect to receive the duty or all the duty on through cargo, and that in any case a preliminary discussion and arrangement would have to be arrived at between the I orte and ourselves, acting in his behalf, for regulating the distribution of the duties on through export or import cargo at Koweit in a manner fair both to himself and to Turkey. In regard to local cargo, his rights would, of course, have to be specifically separated or safeguarded. I expressed the personal view that this was an instance in ^ which our interests and his would be the same, and that it would be our business to see- that he was fairly treated. Sheikh Khazal gave useful help in getting Mubarak to \ lew this question in a sensible light. ... 10. We now come to his main objection, the clause requiring him to receive a Turkish ' commissaire' or agent in Koweit. ... . , •, Here, to begin with, Sheikh Mubarak was bluntly uncompromising, saying that it was one of the specific and chief features of his agreements with us that he should refuse to receive the agent of any foreign Power, including Turkey, and that the admission of any representative on the part of the Turkish Government in Koweit was the one thing that lie had been always determined to resist a outrance, and had up to now succeeded in withstanding. Then followed a long discussion in which the case of Egypt and the argument that the appointment was a useful indication and necessary result of the recognition of his administrative autonomy were made the most of. Eventually he agree , provided that I would confirm the purport of their message in writing, to bo\\ to the will and advice of His Majesty's Government, relying on their assurance of the4 identity of our interests and on the enjoyment of their efficacious support in case of need against the activities and intrigues on the part of the Turkish agent which he instinctively apprehended, and which he feared would prove no less a worry to ourselves than to him. I was not specially authorised to give him the purport of the Secretary of State's telegram in writing; but I do not think I should have got his assurance in writing without it, and my refusal to give it would have aroused undesirable suspicion of our good faith in his mind. 11. We separated a few minutes later, and he subsequently sent me the letter of acceptance of which I attach a translation. The first portion is based on lines suggested to him by myself; the remainder, from the words ' I would only represent' onwards, is not meant by him to detract from his acceptance, but merely reminds us of the three questions of succession, customs, and admission of European foreigners to Koweit in connection with which he either forsees difficulty and claims our support, or feels that the situation needs clearing by the light of the convention. With the first two matters I have dealt sufficiently in the foregoing paragraphs. As regards the third—his future attitude towards foreigners—Sheikh Mubarak incidentally referred to the question of the overtures made to him in the past by Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co., and enquired whether his obligation to admit a Turkish agent involved any obligation or permission to admit other foreigners. 1 replied that our advice to him to keep Messrs. Wonckhaus and others at a safe distance had reference partly to the indefinite nature of his status vis-a-vis the Turks, a fact which was likely to afford such persons opportunity for intrigue. I continued that ray personal view was that the regulation and establishment of his status by the present convention somewhat altered the position, but I explained that the terms of the convention only provided for and referred to the admission of a Turkish agent, and did not affect his existing understanding with us as regards others; so that I considered that it was still obligatory for him to consult us before admitting other foreigners. I concluded, however, that I would, if he desired, make a fresh reference to Government with regard to the case of Messrs. Wonckhaus and ascertain their views. Sheikh Mubarak agreed that that was the best course to pursue, and 1 trust that 1 shall receive instructions on the point. 12. Though there is no doubt that, by the achievement of the convention with Turkey, Sheikh Mubarak's position—provided that he has our staunch support in repelling the slightest encroachment by the Turks on the terms of it—is greatly \ improved, yet there can equally be no doubt that, in virtue of our engagements with Koweit, more especially articles 5, 9, 10, and 1'Z of the Shweikh Agreement, we bear a very serious and lively responsibility towards the Sheikh ; and 1 therefore venture very respectfull}' to draw pointed attention to those articles now, and to express the earnest hope that we shall demonstrate to the Sheikh and to the Porte, from the moment the convention comes into operation, our fixed intention to protect Sheikh Mubarak's interests to the utmost. 13. Before concluding this somewhat lengthy report I should like to avail myself of the opportunity, now that those portions of the convention affecting the Sheikhs of Koweit and Moharamerah are practically completed, of recording my acknowledgments for the loyal co-operation which I have received throughout from Captain Shakespear and Major Haworth, the political officers accredited to those potentates, at my recent interviews and in the spade work done on the spot in connection with the details. I have the more reason to appreciate this in that, owing to the absence of direct telegraphic communication with either port, and the fact that many of Government's references needed speedy telegraphic reply, 1 have been unable always to consult them before replying as freely as I should wish to have done; but Government will, I am sure, appreciate the fact that the amenable demeanour of the Sheikhs is due in no inconsiderable measure to the happy relations existing between them and the two political officers attached to them. I also wish at the same time to commend to Government the excellent work done and valuable assistance rendered to me by Captain A. T. Wilson, in connection with the Mohammerah frontier question. 14. I am sending copies of this communication to His Majesty's Minister and to the Political Secretary, India Office, for information. I have, &amp;c. P. Z.

AS regards the matter of the Commission for the safeguarding the interests of commerce on the Shatt-el-Arab, I have understood the purport of the articles and the scope of them, and your desire that I should authorise your Honour to inform the British Government that, as Sheikh of Mohammerah and its dependencies, when the time comes for the British Government to acquaint me with their advice for the entrust- —ment of the supervision and protection of the interests of commerce and navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab to the British member of the Commission, after its formation, I shall be ready to comply, on the condition that the supervisor to whom I thus entrust my interests will consult me in all questions affecting me, and that if we should not be of one mind in regard to any matter, he will postpone action pending reference of the issue to the British Government. (Sealed) KHAZAL. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to the Sheikh of Koweit. (Translation.) (After compliments.) Mohammerah, July 6, 1913. AT my interview with your Honour and our friend Sardar Arfa (Sheikh of Moham merah) to-day, I told your Honour of my having learnt from Captain Shakespear of your being somewhat disturbed by the condition in the convention dealing with the location of a Turkish representative at Koweit. I informed Government of the anxiety which you felt on the subject, and to-day I have informed you verbally of the terms of their response, I also explained to you my personal view that the mere existence of the necessity of appointing a Turkish agent would be rather a useful indication of the administrative autonomy of your Government. As you requested, I now write to you the purport of the communication which I was instructed to make to you, so that you may have it by you. In it Government intimate that, in their opinion, the points which you have conceded in the course of this agreement—which was on a give-and-take basis—you must regard as the price paid in exchange for the great advantages which you derive from it. Among them the confirmation of your independence on the basis of this convention, and the formal recognition of your extensive claims. Further, it is not hidden from your Honour that the Sublime Porte undertakes not to interfere in the question of succession or in the internal or external affairs of your administration, and you are also aware that there will always be an agent of the British Government accredited to you at Koweit; again, it is established in your mind that you have the formal assurance of the British Government to support you in your affairs so long as you faithfully observe your engagements to us as you have in the past. ^ Having regard to all these considerations, and after these explicit explanations, the v British Government is confident that your Honour will realise that the matter of the appointment of a Turkish agent at Koweit is one of the nature of a formality, and that there is no cause for you to be alarmed and disturbed thereby. In conclusion, I am directed to assure you that there is no divergence between your interests and those of the British Government, and that if they had seen in this detail anything harmful or dangerous for your Honour, they would not have approved of it or recommended it for your acceptance. P. z. COX. Enclosure 5 in No, 1. The Sheikh of Koweit to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox. (Translation.) Mohammerah, July 7, 1913. I HAVE received your esteemed letter of the 6th July, 1913 (1st Shaaban, 1331), and understood its contents, in confirmation of what you explained to me verbally at our interview to-day (i.e., 6th July). [1825't—5] CI trust you will inform the British Government that I recognise and admit the force of your explanations that myi nterests and those of the British Government are identical, and that there is no difference between them ; and accordingly it is incumbent on me to rely upon the advice of the Great Government in this matter; but they will, I am sure, understand that when any doubt enters my mind, and I see in any measure a probable source of difficulty and danger to my own interests or those of Government, it is proper for me to communicate my apprehensions for their august views. But in view of your explanations and letter under reply, I can but bow to their view and authorise your Honour to say that I shall rely on the Great Government to support me so lono; as I am firm in faithful fulfilment of my engagements with them as in the past. Please God, I shall preserve those obligations and increase my intimate attachment to the Great Government, and shall act up to what is written in our treaties, and even more than that. I would only represent to you that among the stipulations in our treaties, and in the agreement regarding the lease of land at Bandar Shweikh, my ' sons ' are specified as mv successors, while now, in the condition as arranged between the two Governments, the word 'khalaf' appears. Now ' khalaf' {' successors ') includes sons and others. Again, in our treaties I am described as not agreeing to the presence in Koweit of the subjects of any foreign Government, especially the Turkish Government. These are two points in our treaties, and further, in the documentary agreement between yourselves and me in regard to the lease of land at Shweikh, 1 stipulated that the right of levying customs duty on your subjects and others belonged to me, and on this understanding the agreement) was reached, and I have the deed and you also have a duplicate. I have explained to you these three points; please give them your high conside ration. And whatever was included in the treaty was with the concurrence of both parties, and the agreement regarding the lease of land at Shweikh was also concluded with the concurrence of both parties. I beg to refer this to your Honour's consideration and attention, and the decision rests with you. (Sealed) MUBARAK-BIN-SUBAH. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir F. Cox to the Sheikh of Koweit. (Translation.) (After compliments.) Mohammerah, July 7, 1913. I PIAVE duly received your esteemed letter dated 2Dd Shaaban, 1331 (7th July, 1913), and understood its contents. I am highly obliged for your compliance with the views of the British Government. Your honour drew attention (in the same communication) to certain items contained in the treaties and engagements existing between the British Government and yourself. Your friend has not got the text of them here in Mohammerah, except the translation of the agreement executed between yourself and Colonel Meade, Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the 23rd January, 1899. The purport of that instrument is that your Honour would not receive an agent from any foreign Government without previous reference to, and the concurrence of, the British Government. In the course of the present negotiation it was necessary for the British Government to acquiesce in the appointment of an agent of the Turkish Government at Koweit as the price of the recognition of the administrative autonomy of your Government, and in return for the other advantages accruing to your Excellency, as set forth in the document in question. Secondly, with reference to the use of the word ' successor ' (' khalaf') instead of the word ' sons ' (' aolad ') therein. There was no motive behind this. For you are aware that, as stipulated in the convention, the Turkish Government specifically refrains from concerning itself with this question, and agrees not to interfere in connection there with. Consequently, in my opinion, everything that is recorded in this regard in the agreements between the British Government and yourself holds good and is not altered. But as I have not got the documents with me, I will, on arrival at Bushire, after careful examination, write to your honour in confirmation of above, and if I see any point that arouses doubt, I will refer to Government.7 I am leaving to-night, and I send you cordial greeting, and the hope that, pending our next meeting, you may enjoy the best of health. ^ TURKISH negotiations. Please see Cox's letter dated the 10th July, copy of which has been sent to you direct. ; _ -i -i i i Parafjraph 7.—We agree with Cox as to importance of convincing Sheikh that the British commissioner wilf be in sympathy with him, and doubtless His Majesty's Government will bear this point in mind when putting names forward for selection for the appointment. It does net, however, seem possible to accept Sheikh s stipulation that in questions on which he and the commissioner differ action should be postponed pending a reference to the British Government. He will always have the support of our British officer in reasonable demands, and it will always be open to Sheikh to invite our good offices should such a situation arise, but such action must, it would appear, be taken independently of the commissioner, who is an officer in the employment of the Tuikish Government. . • . i i r PGsVdfjvciph 9 i ICowcit. — Wb consider thcit it will be 06st to 110 tuithcr communication to Sheikh on the subject of the succession, nor is it, in our opinion desirable, until the Sheikh presses it strongly, to raise question of recognising Sheikh Jabr during his father's lifetime. We propose to inform Cox accordingly. As to customs question, article 8 of convention, we agree with Cox that the Sheikh should be informed that it is premature to raise question now, and that in the event of the railway coming to Koweit he can rely upon us to protect his interests. Paragraph 11.—Tire terms of convention as regards admission of Turkish agent do not, in our opinion, relieve Sheikh of his obligations to consult us before admitting other foreigners. We propose to instruct Cox to inform Sheikh that in event of Wonckhaus or other foreigners wishing to open agencies in Koweit he should refer to British Government before committing himself.

He is reported by political agent to have arranged to leave on the 1st August for a visit to Bin Sand, and possibility is su gig es ted of the latter either forcing Abdulla to turn out the Turks or of himself taking possession of Katr.'

WE repeat, for information, following recent items of news regarding Bin Sand telegraphed from Bushire on the 30th ultimo :— Political agent, Bahrein, reports that Bin Sand, while at Katif, wrote to the Sheikh of Katr demanding that Turkish garrison at A1 Bidaa should be expelled. ' Report received from Koweit that Kasras Subaih has been occupied by Bin Saud. # u Following from Residency agent on the Trucial coast:— '' The Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai, who belong to the same tribe, have been in consultation. 1 he former has obtained, and holds, a position of supremacy in [1825 ft—5]Baraimi and the vicinity since the Wahabis left. He feels certain that Bin Saud s activities will now be turned in that direction, and, fearing this, he has decided with Sheikh of Dibai to call out their Bedouin followers in the Sabakhat Matti and take initiative against him. (For Sabakhat Matti see I ersian Gulf Crdzotteer, page 1,200.) . o • n t i • i i, -n u ' As our reply to Bin Saud was not in any way unfriendly 1 tnink ne wili probably not think it worth while to take action likely to make us hostile , on the other hand, a very favourable opportunity is, of course, offered him, if he wishes to take it, by the present general situation in Oman. 1 he sheikhs are being told by mo that the action they fear is unlikely, and are being warned not to take initiative in hostilities. I should, however, like to .be able to reassure them, if possible, by statement as^ to attitude of Government in event of Bin Saud possibly taking action of kind indicated.''Zo io. ii [This Docrnnent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA CONFIDENTIAL.

IN continuation of previous correspondence as to the situation on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf, I am directed to enclose, to be laid before the Secretary ot State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram from the Viceroy regarding the policy to be adopted in relation to the El Katr peninsula. The Marquess of Crewe agrees with the Government of India that it is desirable in all the circumstances to defer for the present any action in regard to the conclusion of a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah, and he would propose, subject to Sir E. Grey's concurrence to instruct the Government of India accordingly. I am, &amp;c. LIONEL ABRAHAMS. Enclosure in No. 1. Government of India to the Marquess of Crewe. (Telegraphic.) P. September 11, 1913. El Katr. Please refer to my telegram dated 13th ultimo. Resident recently paid visit to A1 Bidaa and told Sheikh that arrangements for Turkish garrison's withdrawal were in progress. He now reports:— ' Newspaper reports of the conclusion of the Convention and of the intention that Turkish garrison should be withdrawn had already been seen by Sheikh, but in view of recent arrival of a Turkish gunboat with rations for garrison for some months, and of positive statement by her captain to Sheikh, that the report as to garrison's withdrawal was quite unfounded, I gave Sheikh a written intimation. ' He puts his position vis-d-vis Bin Sand thus. On his father's death Bin Saud wrote and asked him to pay him a visit, saying that he must get rid of Turks' garrison if he wanted to retain Bin Saud's friendship. To this Abdullah replied that the garrison did no harm, and that to turn it out would only make Turkish Government his enemy ; he undertook, however, not to admit of any increase of garrison, or to allow Turks to use El Katr as base of operations. He declined invitation to visit Bin Saud for the present, excusing himself on score of his father's death. ' He also told me that Khalifah, his elder half-brother, had paid Bin Saud a visit and that while he professed to have spoken to the Amir in sense of Abdullah's letter, latter could not put absolute trust in him. He said that in any case, in event of Bin Saud seriously intending to occupy El Katr, he was not sure that even if he and his brothers were united, they would be able to keep him out. and expressed opinion that a warning from us would not stop him from instigating raids into El Katr by Bedouin though it might perhaps prevent him from going to A1 Bidaa. ' Sheikh added that the recognition now accorded of his independence was appreciated by him, and that in any case, provided we gave him facilities for meeting his own legitimate requirements, he was ready to co-operate in suppressing arms traffic ; in other respects he hoped we would refrain from pressing alterations in status quo at once. What with the Turks and ourselves and Bin Saud, the fact is that the Sheikh does not know quite where he is.' Avoidance of haste is in circumstances clearly desirable, and for the present, action regarding treaties should be put off. Such delay will also fit in with Foreign Office's expressed wish that publication of Anglo-Turkish Agreement should not be followed by [1863 6]conclusion of treaty with Sheikh till some time has elapsed. We think ^ that when Sheikh is firmly established, and we have defined our relations with the Amir, and when time has been given for affairs of the peninsula to settle down, we might take a suitable opportunity to make a treaty on the general lines which Resident sketched in letter of the 22nd June (enclosure in letter of the 24th July, from my Foreign Secretary). We would assure Sheikh of protection by sea and of our good offices if he is attacked by laud without provocation. In return he would be required to co-operate in suppressing arms traffic, to receive a British Agent, and to undertake to refrain from having relations with, or receiving representative of, or ceding any land to, any Power other than Great Britain, and to refuse to grant without our consent any monopolies or concessions or cable-land in o- rights. The agreement should generally resemble those made with Irucial Chiefs, as regards maritime, trucial, or slave trade. We could secure later on the other desiderata which the Resident mentions. \ -v.

Sir, Foreign Office, October 31, 1913. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th October in which yon enclose a telegram, covering one from the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, from the Government of India regarding the desirability ot' securing the early withdrawal of the Turkish garrison from El Katr. I am to state in reply that Sir E. Grey concurs in the concluding sentence of your letter, in which the hope of the Secretary of State for India is expressed that ratifica tion of the Anglo Turkish conventions will not much longer be deferred, but that this is dependent upon the conclusion of negotiations between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company, as, pending the conclusion of such negotiations, the Anglo-Turkish agreements cannot become operative. Sir E. Grey is, however, far from convinced that there is such urgent and para mount necessity, suddenly arisen, of withdrawing at once from El Bidaa the Turkish garrison which has now been there since 187-J. As soon as the convention with Turkey has been ratified and is operative. Bis Majesty's Government can ask Turkey to withdraw the garrison, should she fail to do so spontaneously ; but in the meantime Sir E. Grey considers that it would be expedient that Sir P. Cox should be instructed to explain to Ibn Saud, who doubtless will be able to appreciate the communication, that effect will naturally be given to our agreement with Turkey within a short time of its ratification, and that His Majesty's Government expect ratification to take place before the end of the year.

From —Lifutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K C.I.E., C.S.L, Political Resi- dent in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Delhi. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of No. C-23, dated .oth November 1913. . C °P,y of , the ,ett . er marginally cited which has been received from the Political Agent at Kuwait, reporting an overture from the Wali of Basrah to the Shaikh, It would appear to be an intrigue connected with the negotiations with Bin Saud which Hakki Pasha recently stated to be in progress. No. C -22, dated Kuwait, the ioth November 1913. From— Captain VV. H. I. Shakespear, I.A , Political Agent, Kuwait, ro— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report herewith the substance of a conversation which recently took place between Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah and myself, as it may be of interest in view of the Anglo-Turkish Convention so lately concluded and of the Porte s declarations therein recorded. The Shaikh may perhaps have ^ xa Rg era,:e d what actually passed, 1 pour se faire valoir^, but I see no reason to doubt that the story has a foundation of fact. . 2 - Some ten days ago the Shaikh's agent in Basrah, Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badr, was summoned by the Acting Wali and after much eulogy of Shaikh Mubarak together with adjurations to secrecy, he was requested to inform the Shaikh that the Grand Vizier and the Minister for the Interior desired to discuss some secret matters personally with the Shaikh over the telegraph wire and that if the Shaikh could see his way to fix a day and lime when he would be present in either one of the I urkish telegraph oHfices at Fao or Basrah, the ministers named would converse direct with him from the Porte. Abdul Aziz replied to the Acting Wali that he was sure the Shaikh would be averse to the suggestion unless he could be given some indication beforehand as to the subject of the intended discussion. On this the Acting Wali said the matter was secret but seeing that Abdul Aziz was already in the shaikh's confidence he supposed he might divulge the outlines of the proposed discussion. The Porte intended to appoint a VVali to Basrah at an early date, and the post might be conferred on the present acting incumbent or another but in any case the Porte particularly desired to obtain the closest co-operation between the Shaikh and the VVali, more especially in matters concerning the desert tribes and Nejd ; it was also intended that the 'Wali should be given orders to consult Shaikh Mubarak in any and every matter likely to cause controversy whether in Basrah itself or in the desert: in short, the Wali would be required to consult the Shaikh of Kuwait in all matters relating to the Basrah Vilayet and the Arabs in Arabia and would be expected to conform to his suggestions. Abdul Aziz is said to have replied that from what he knew of the Shaikh he thought it most improbable that Mubarak would agree to mix himself in matters so far beyond his range, and which might lead to his becoming entangled in serious difficulties with the desert tribes, apart from the tax on his time and resources which an acceptance of the position indicated would entail; he would, however, inform the Shaikh of the conversation. The Acting Wah then closed the interview with more eulogy of the Shaikh's loyalty to and friendly relations with the Porte, pointed out the great honour conferred on the Shaikh by the trust reposed in him and the Sultan's desire toobtain his co-operation on so extended a scale and particularly requested that the matter should be kept secret even from the Shaikh s bosom friend, Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan. 3. In relating the story to me Shaikh Mubarak said he had no intention of agreeing for the suggestion seemed obviously a manoeuvre designed to shift to his shoulders the unpleasant burden of controlling the desert tribes, in which the Turks had failed so lamentably, whilst he personally would remain always ready to their hand, should the Turkish authorities require in future an excuse^ or a scape-goat on which to fasten any further consequences of their own inaptitude. He said he had requested Abdul Aziz bin Salim to convey to the Acting Wali his appreciation of the honour conferred in inviting his co-operation and to say that he regretted he had his time very fully occupied with the administration of his own territories, people and tribes, that he was an old man, and that he could not presume to advise the distinguished officials the Porte might appoint to the charge of the Basra Vilayet, who would naturally be better informed regarding matters in their own province than was possible for the Shaikh, living as he did at a distance. 4 1 thanked the Shaikh for his frankness in telling me the story and contented myself with observing that though the scheme theoretically might have advantages for the Porte I could see none in it for the Shaikh of Kuwait, but rather a probability of unending difficulties with the desert tribes, Ibn Kashid and the Amir of Nejd, the almost inevitable result of the equivocal position in which he personally would be placed ; that, as he well knew, the prosperity ot his port and people depended very largely upon his maintaining good and amicable relations with the chiefs of the interior of Arabia.
