Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No*523.S dated 12th October, 1929 on the subject of storage of patrol at Muscat* 2. I regret to inform you that the site which you have indicated at Sira-al-Shanii is quite unsuitable on account of its exposed position. 3. It is suggested that the old French building which has been abandoned will be most suutable for our purposes. Between this building and the site of the Saval coaling station there is a ravine which would act as a most efficient barrier in the event of fire in the petrol store because the burning fuel would be carried down the ravine and be unable to reach the coal store. 4. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and it would be much appreciated if an early answer could be given as the Chief Engineer will be visiting Muacat in the near future and I should like him to be able to make definite suggestions about the repairs for the buildibgs which we propose to ectubligh there.

KESIDENT. oOo &gt;ND.O.Nu.C/ /&amp;3 13th April 1933. Dear Colonel Xctb With reference to your exprese letter Uo.347-S dated 7th April 1933 to Aviation Baghdad regarding the reconnaissance of landing grounds at rasirah and Kurbat, it seems xo me this portends fairly frequent trips by land-machines to these parts. 2. About a year ago when the first flight of land-machines came to itfusoot, I was asked as a favour to put up the personnel and mount guards over the machines. The landing ground, I may Vi mention, be-wig aoout half a mile from my house at Bait-al-Falaj• 3. The arrival of the machines resembled rather the arrival of a party of shipwrecked mariners on some foreign shore. They occupied my house like a barracks, my kitcnen had to be given over for cooking the men’s food, the State lorry had to leave its normal worx end letch load after load of petrol from the dump which is at least 3 miles away, near Muscat. When it was not doing this, it was carrying personnel backwards and forward* between luscat and the aerodrome or fetching stores etc, my private cor also was at their disposal. These conditions lasted for between 3 weeks and one month. 4. 1 should be very grateful to you if it could be explainec some way to the H.A.F. that if they intend sending lond- n.achines down this way, they must make their own arrangements for everything in the same way as they do for their flying- boats. There are plenty of taxis between Muscat and the aerodrome and there is also an excellent road. If they require a lorr^ ior the transportation of petrol, then tney must buy one of their own. I might mention that our one-and-holf-ton Morris lorry will be up for sale ^ery shortly as we are buying a newer and bigger one. 7 he Hon’ble Lieut-Colonel G. Loch, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.-2- 5. What I wish to make clear is that I did not in the least mind doing all this for the first flight of land- machines but in future my house will not be put at the disposal of the R.a*F. nor can the State lorry be taken away from its ordinary work for R.A.F.Purposes. 6. The question of guards also is worth consideration. Every single man of the Levy Corps is fully occupied as we ore now engaged on a major public work in connection with building a new customs’ quay at Muscat. There are also three guards to be found as well as a permanent garrison of 16 men at Khaburah on the Batinoh Coast. There is no reason why the contractor Mohammad ttasib should not provide chawkidars for looking after the machines. r '• As I have said above while one is ready to assist a pioneer expedition in every way possible yet when it comes to a regular land-machine service, it becomes the duty of A.H.Q,. to have a proper ground organization and not depend upon the kindness of outsiders.
