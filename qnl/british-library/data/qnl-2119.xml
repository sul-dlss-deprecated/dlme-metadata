He said they would prexc i to have a contract with the lurkish Government and work the dredger themselves as the operations would then be properly done and everybody would benefit by them’ but he dia not think the Turks would agree to this. He understood that the Turks wanted to work it themselves, and intended raising the purchase-money from the landed proprietors and others interested in the dredging of the creeks. He said the whole transaction was of a speculative character ; they would test the dredger at Maaghil and show the lurks how to work it on the understanding that they purchased it if satisfactory. I hear from Turkish sources that the commission which has been formed for the purpose expect the Germans to test the machine by dredging the entrance to the Ashar creek, winch is silted up with mud, and that they will purchase it if this work is satisfactorily accomplished.

Condition of these creeks has long been a grievance with local merchants, British or other, and the authorities have been repeatedly urged to take steps to improve it, which seems very desirable in the interests of trade.

This step appears inconsistent with the under standing come to with the Sublime Porte to the ef fect that, during the progress of negotiations on these questions there should be no disturbance of the status quo in regard to the arrangements for the lighting and buoyage of the Shatt-el-Arab. There are moreover two serious objections to it. In the first place the sudden Illumination of a light in this manner must be a source of con fusionconfusion rather than of assistance to shipping.

So far as I can ascertain from my record, the primitive lights hitherto shown at Fao have never been officially notified, and are not relied on by shipping, vide Persian Gulf Pilot (5th edition), page 210. To erect a regular light now and notify it officially is certainly a breach of status quo in any case. “We have to consider new light from two points of view; first, as a possible and harmless item in the scope of River Commission if the latter takes shape. Secondly, as affecting our own independent scheme for lighting and buoying the bar, in the event of River Commission not taking shape. “ In the first connection it seems quite possible that present Turkish action is designed to prejudice negotiations for River Commission (in regard to which Turks have apparently not yet committed themselves) and to provide a basis for a claim for levying Turkish dues on shipping as suggested by Consul at Basrah in March 1911. “As regards second point of view; the new light would not, any more than former light, affect our own independent arrangements for lighting and buoying the bar, provided Turkish lightship was ultimately removed ; but as the position now stands, by linking continuously their lightship with the new Fao light by means of a gas buoy laid at some point between them, Turks would be able to confront us with a fait accompli in the shape of colourably complete and independent lurkish scheme for lighting and buoying the entrance to River. “ In any case their action seems to indicate that their friendly or serious intentions in regard to River Commission cannot be depended on, and this is rendered more serious by the fact that we have learnt by experience during past two years that they are able to take these deliberate local steps to improve their own position and modify status quo ivithout oui receiving any warning of their doings from Basrah until the pioject is actuall} m course of being carried out. “In the above circumstances it seems urgent that we should piote^t effectively, and I venture respectfully to suggest that in doing so we should intimate that unless the Porte forthwith accepts the proposal for the River Commission, in the scope of which this new light can be included, we s a drop negotiations and take our own steps to maintain our position m ic matter. I would even suggest for consideration whether the present worn not be a good opportunity for pressing Porte [to ?] comply with all proposals contained in our Memorandum, and for taking necessary assertive action in the event of their failing to comply. Ihere seems e\eiy reason o in ^ that once they are free from their present difficulties m Europe they will become all the more intractable in regard to outstanding issues in (. ns) S We concur in these views.

(Confidential.) Your Highness, Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Highness herewith a memorandum embodying the reply of His Majesty’s Government to the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last, relating to questions connected with the Bagdad Railway and the Persian Gulf. In communicating this document to your Highness I desire to call your attention to two additional points which are not dealt with in the memorandum or its annexes. In the first place His Majesty’s Government consider it highly desirable, in order to secure the smooth working of the arrangements proposed in regard ro the Bagdad Railway, that at least one British director, approved by His Majesty’s Government, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Railway Company. Such an arrangement would of course require the consent of the German Government. Secondly, as the Turkish Government are aware, certain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), and the geographical position of Mohammerah is such that the sheikh cannot fail to be brought into contact with the Riverain Commission ; and unless provision is made for these facts there is a risk of the friction arising which it is the object of the two Governments to avoid. There would have been much to be said for an International Riverain Commission on which Persia, equally with Great Britain and Turkey, should be represented. But as His Majesty’s Government, appreciating the objections entertained by the Porte, have not pressed for this, it is necessary to provide in some other way for the representation of Persia in such matters as may touch her rights whether under the Treaty of Erzeroum or under this new agreement. His Majesty’s Government therefore propose that the commissioner who is a^British subject should be charged with the duty of making to the commission such representations as may at any time be necessary upon any question affecting those rights, and they will be willing to use their good offices with the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to agree to this arrangement. _ These two points come, perhaps, outside the scope of the matters dealt with in the memorandum which are confined to subjects of negotiation between Great Biitain and Turkey alone, but His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to them and trust that they will receive the favourable consideration of the Imperial Ottoman Government. T , s 1 have, &amp;c. E. GREY. Enclosure in No. 1. Draft of Memorandum to be communicated to Turkish Ambassador. 1 HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to examine with much care and tention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum commumcated ■ the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15 th April last. . , , 2 Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by e conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be sired In the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an reement to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of orifice or advantage which P each individual clause may imply, but also in its cunndatne [2546 s—l]! and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Gove merit therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals 601 considerations HIM. 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may U dealt with under three distinct headings :— ^ ■ (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of th Persian Gulf. ^ (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports an] imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner ii which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-hal centuries ago, of the first English factorv at Bussorah; they have ago, ot the first English factory at Bussorali; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase ii the Turkish customs duties 5. The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section oi the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held or this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances Majesty s_ Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity ot their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the wa\ rom Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. tt- ^ r ' It wo uld be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless i A a ^ eS 7 s e v ernment were at the same time able to show that British interests of feel brmnrI C iaiaC + e r safeguarded.

His Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula of El Katr, including El Bidaa t hey have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12 * The Turkish memorandum of the loth April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911. Further His Majesty’s Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military randum post^ from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with (Annex 4). the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum. 13. His Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their pc hey in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty’s Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the oth May, 1903, that “ His Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, \ and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.” His Majesty’s Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain— (a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b.) To police its waters; and (e.) To conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern ment, His Majesty’s Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the developmentof trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. IG They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government wil not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved’ relations which cannot fail to ensue. . . ,. i • i i , 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty’s Government in recent months that 0 ^ the fr . 0n J 1 ® r between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah When His Majestys Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government t} ia t question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty s Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Pgypt, theiij subject to the assent of the other 1 owtis, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase m the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. ANNEX 1. HIS Majesty’s Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance, but to which they have not referred in this memorandum. His Majesty’s Government desire to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. His Majesty’s Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them. Foreign Office.

The Commission shall appoint such officers and employes as may be necessary, but the Chief Engineer and the Surveyor shall be of British nationality. The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. (jj 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties (a.) The execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (b.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (c.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (d.) The control of pilotage. (e.) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control of the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river specified in the Schedule to this Convention. (/.) The supervision, so far as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this convention, and subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharves, quays, docks, and jetties belonging to private persons in or on the banks of the river, and the provision of such additional accommodation and facilities as the Commission may deem necessary. 7. The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation. 9. The Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. In the event of such dues being found necessary they shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including tbe administration of the Commission, and their produce shall be exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues exceed 1 fr. per net registered ton of shipping. 10. Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong, similarly there shall be no differentiation in the matter of facilities between vessels or goods of different nations or persons, or between vessels arriving from or departing to different places. 11.

The Commission shall correspond upon all matters connected with the duties entrusted to it with the Sublime Porte direct, and not through the local authorities. upended by the Commission shall be vested17. The local authorities shall not interfere in any way with the houses, buildings, land, or other property of the Commission, or with its funds, or with the discharge of their duties by the officers of the^ police, pilotage, or other services maintained by '■'n the Commission, or with wharves, jetties, docks, or quays in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons. 18. The transfer to the Commission of any buoys or lights in the approaches to the Shatt-el-Arab shall not be deemed to affect the territorial jurisdiction in the waters where such buoys or lights are placed, or be made a ground on the part of the Imperial Ottoman Government for claiming that such waters are within its territorial jurisdiction, nor shall anything in this Convention be deemed to give the Commission power to exercise jurisdiction or to carry out duties or to hold land outside the limits of the Ottoman Empire without the consent of the territorial Power, or to affect the operation or the interpretation of the provisions of any treaty or arrangement prescribing or defining the limits of the said Empire. 19. This agreement shall be binding during twenty-one years from the day of its signature. In case neither of the contracting parties shall have given notice to the other, twelve months before the expiration of the said period of twenty-one years, of the intention to terminate the agreement, it shall remain in force until the expiration of one year from the day on which either of the contracting parties shall have denounced it. ANNEX 4. Kowe it. HIS Majesty’s Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwam to Jabal Sanan and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na’airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Ttadaif. On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. Districts and Islands .—The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Koweit town and Riqai. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm-al-Khilan, Yah, Qira-al-Marru, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and Umm Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Koweit Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, (Jra’ab Adan, Salu, Hazaim, and Sudah. The maritime possessions of Koweit consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Failakah, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Koweit Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al- Maradim. A map is enclosed showing the limits of Koweit. ANNEX 5. Mohammerah Frontier. HIS Majesty’s Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the fiontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government now have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the [2546 s—1] 158 conference of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major (afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. ^ Moreover, much information, ft which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced in the voluminous records of the East India Company, who carried on direct trade with Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating in regard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab during the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be followed firstly, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu’aib will be observed at a point 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula ” ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agencv of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu’aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty’s Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni feahli and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows , }• T *? a £ whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ipso facto, the rentier ot Persia: m other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the “Hawizeh district” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia, i a 1 .’ 011 abo\e premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown in 6 011 ^ w *h he noticed that the line (which is formed by ^ ^i 0 e T^ arsa ’ ami is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, r U . he ehani i el of th .e marsh just west of Shu’aib, continues in a ( J ie ? I0n mfid it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i Basri, whence it breaks Iht K 1 in! P ace ’. and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason existfwp f 1 aSri , 18 recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the , , t ; 'i a 'i' 11 :1 v ® 111 raln water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and fron, P f hrJ’L, rlbeS T U ,v n l ler HawlZel1 in this Action is regulated by the distance and this limii ^ G a ^ air ’, a *' which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, extensive S i™ C f 0Usld f ed be r &lt;*ched Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. informalion^ re^anhnghthe fronder ^of Tla** 1 P £ SS f ssion of P recise aud trustworthy uncertain antlinrfi; .i wt on ” 1 ® r °I Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more Ottoman Governmp V ^ not without interest to recall to the Imperial not usually nr, ,.rl 1 * 1Jervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were (printed in Cons an J 7 T deratl0D ' admits “ Chapter XIII of his book Government to ln\- ,■! - °*V tbat h would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman h rExScv , t ' ‘ m 11 the ° 0Un u try 0f Hawizeh - ^gh, in the subsequent chapter, excellency expresses the view that it “ might be useM ” for Turkey to claim it as9 a pretext for proposing something else, viz., that the Kerkha should be adopted as the boundary above Shena. Coming now to the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locally observed enters the ivhaiym Canal (which is the name of the channel running from the luilvish Customs Post at Di aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bowarin and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point between the Nahr Di’aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid; it follows the middle of the iSahi Ivhaiym until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2.) It then pioceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying maps Nos. 3 and 4), along the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, in mid-stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. The claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Furbish Government^ in many ways and on many different occasions, thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di’aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in, for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab,' it follows the medium filum aquce of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See maps Nos. 3 and 4.) This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or “thalweg” is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. The records of the past 300 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty’s Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to “ prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession” of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions :— (i.) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia:— (a.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma’awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. Ihese islands aie in fact paits of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. (b.) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh.(ii) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty's Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the St and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is in the main stream ^ of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the karun, to be recognised as within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) ^ (iv) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein (y) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. t . (vi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue m full enjoyment ol his existing 'proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish teiritoi}.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000c5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/305</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000c5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/305</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 4259/1912 'Persian Gulf: Turks and lighting and buoying'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1914</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-27T23:37:14</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (119 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 119; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume comprises telegrams, despatches, correspondence, memoranda, and notes, relating to lighting and buoying installed by the Turkish Government in the Persian Gulf.Correspondence discusses concerns over the erection of a Turkish lighthouse in Fao and the basis upon which a protest could be lodged. Also discussed is the deployment of a Turkish lightship in the Shatt al-Arab, through the replacement of the old Turkish vessel (
                           Kilidi Bahr) by a new lightship (
