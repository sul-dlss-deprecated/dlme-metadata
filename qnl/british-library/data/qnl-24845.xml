[Ratifications exchanged at Tehran, January 13, 1902.] [Signed also in Persian text.] His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Emperor of India, and His Majesty the King of all the Kingdoms of Persia, being desirous to extend the system of telegraphic communication between Europe and India through Persia, already established in virtue of previous Treaties, have resolved that a Convention for that purpose shall be concluded; wherefore their Majesties have named as their Plenipotentiaries: His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Emperor of India, Sir Arthur Henry Hardinge, Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George, Companion of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath, his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipo tentiary to the Court of Persia ; And His Majesty the King of all the Kingdoms of Persia, his Excellency Mirza Nasrullah Khan Mushir-ed-Dowleh, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bearer of the Order of the Lion and the Sun of the first class with green riband, Possessor of the Order of the Pioyal Portrait of His Late Majesty Naser-ed-din Shah, Possessor of the Order of the Portrait of His Present Majesty Muguffer- ed-din Shah, of the First Class, and of the Blue Cordon, Bearer of the Order of the White Eagle, and of the first class of the [65] nr; \Osmanieh adorned with Diamonds, and of the First Order of Leopold (of Austria), and of the First Order of Leopold (of Belgium), and of the Order of St. Alexander adorned with Diamonds, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. ; And the aforesaid distinguished Representatives, after meeting at Tajrisch in the neighbourhood of the capital of Tehran and perusing and exchanging their full powers, which were found in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles :— ARTICLE I. With the view of securing uninterrupted communication be tween Europe and India, it is agreed that, in addition to the present line of telegraph from Tehran to Bushire and submarine cable thence to India, already established in virtue of previous Treaties, a three-wire line of telegraph shall be constructed by the Persian Government from Kashau to the Baluchistan frontier, via Yezd and Kerman, traversing wherever possible inhabited districts. ARTICLE II. In order that the line of telegraph may be constructed in a complete and effective manner, the Persian Government agrees that it shall be built under the direction and supervision of the British Telegraph Staff now controlling the international line in Persia, the British Government advancing to the Persian Govern ment the salaries and allowances of the men actually employed on the work. ARTICLE III. The British Government agrees to procure for the Persian Government at a reasonable price all the posts, wire, insulators, &amp;c., that may be requisite for this work, and to arrange for the carriage of the- stores to the sites required, receiving payment for the same without interest as hereinafter provided. An account of the expenses incurred for this purpose, and certified, in so far as they have been incurred in Persia, by the Persian Telegraph Department, and in so far as they have been incurred outside Persia, by the British Government, shall be submitted as early as possible to the Persian Government. ARTICLE IY. The Persian Government agrees to lease the use and the transit revenue of the line, which is its property, when complete to [65J B 24 the Indo-European Telegraph Department at a rental of 4 per cent, on the capital expended on its construction, including cost of material—three quarters of such rental to be retained by the British Government to recoup them for the advances made, and one quarter, subject to a minimum of 25,000 fr„ to be paid annually to the Persian Government in two half-yearly instalments. It is understood that should the Persian Government’s quarter share of the rental exceed 25,000 fr., such excess shall belong to the Persian Treasury. AETICLE Y. The maintenance of the line, including repairs and the ap pointment, control, and payment of the line guards, who must be Persian subjects, shall remain in the hands of the British Director and Staff, the cost being defrayed by the British Government. The duties of the Telegraph Inspectors and line guards are strictly confined to repairing and maintaining the line. AETICLE VI. The principal offices constituting the permanent residences of the British Electricians and Inspectors shall be situated in towns or large villages, but pending further arrangements to be agreed upon between the two Governments, there shall only be one such office between Kerman and the Indian frontier. The protection of the line and of the officials, whether Persian or British employed on it, shall be the special duty of the Persian Government, and should the English officials wish to proceed on inspections in districts proclaimed as dangerous by the Persian Government, they shall inform the nearest local authority, in order that they may be provided with an escort. The telegraph stations shall be built according to plans approved by the Persian Govern ment, and in towns the houses to be used as such stations shall, wherever possible, be rented. AETICLE VII. The line will be of three wires. One wire will be used by the Persian Telegraph Administration for its local work, and the remaining two wires be for international traffic as provided in Articles IV, V, and VI of the 1872 Convention. AETICLE VIII. The revenue derived from the local traffic on the Persian wireshall belong entirely to the Persian Government. By local traffic is meant messages originating at one Persian station and termi nating at another Persian station. AKTICLE IX. As regards International messages originating or terminating in Persia, the Persian Government shall receive two-thirds of the receipts of all bond fide terminal messages. And as regards transit messages, as this line is merely an alternative one to that now existing between Tehran and Bushire, the arrangement already made, as detailed in Article VIII of the 1872 Convention, will remain as at present. State telegrams passing between the Government of India and the British Minister at Tehran shall be sent at half rates. ARTICLE X. In view of the erection of the new line and of the increase of telegraph stations in Eastern Persia, and in order to facilitate intercourse with them, the Indo-European Telegraph Department shall place an additional wire along the existing line between Tehran and Kashau, and the expenses of procuring, transporting, and putting up this wire will be borne by the Persian Government in the manner provided by Articles II and IV of this Convention. ARTICLE XL The following Articles of the Telegraph Convention of 1872 shall apply to this line, viz.Articles VI, VIII, IX, XI, XIII, XV, and XVII. ARTICLE XII. This Convention shall remain in force until the 1st January, 1925, or for such longer period as the debt due by Persia for the cons dion of the line remains unpaid, and at such date it may if necessary be renewed or revised, but it shall be competent for the British Government at any time before the expiry of this Convention, on giving six months’ notice, to hand over the line in its existing condition to the Persian Government, and to withdraw its officers and employes from the country, ceasing from that date to have any further connection with this Persian Telegraph. Butin this case the Persian Government shall he free from any further payment on account of the construction of the line. The ratifications of the present Convention shall be exchanged at Tehran within five months, or sooner if practicable. Done at Tajrisch, in quadruplicate, this sixteenth day of the month of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and one. (L.S.) AETHUR H. HARDINGF.

Sir I have the honour to inform you that the Peraian Government have again requested me to furnish them with the accounts of the expenditure incurred on the con struction of the Central Persian Telegraph line as pro vided by Articles 3 and 4 of the Convention of 1901, and I transmit herewith copy of a note which I have addressed to the Persian Government in conformity with the instructions contained in your despatch No.4 (1525/10) of January 17th, 1910, presenting the accounts in question. It will be observed that the establishment charges incurred under Article 2 of the Convention have also been submitted to the Persian Government. It will be remembered that in my telegram No.100 of March 10th, 1910, I recommended the abandonment of this claim for fear that its presentation might prejudice the ratifi cation by the Medjliss of the Arabistan Convention.

TERRA N, torch 18th, 1911 Mohr ieur 1e MiniBtre:- I have hac* the honour to receive Your Ex cellency ’r Note of February 12th in which you request in conformity with Article 3 of the Convention of 1901 that a statement of the expenses incurred by the British Government for the construction of the telegraph line between Kachan and the Baluchistan frontier and the •materials used, therein should be furnished to the Persian Government. In reply I have the honour to transmit to you the accounts in question and, in accordance with the instructions I have received from His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to explain. (a) That the accounts of the expenditure on the work have been kept, like the ordinary accounts of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Indian Currency. (b) That for the payments in Persia made in Krans the rates of exchange between krans and rupeesf prevailing at the time of the payments have teen taken. (c) That the payments in England in pounds sterling have teen taken at the exchange of £1 teing equivalent to rupees 15. (d) That the rate of exchange for francs has D^en taken as francs 25 being equivalent to £1. It will be observed that the account of the capital cost of the Central Persian Telegraph line amounts to rupees 1,876,215.5.3. This amount is equivalent to £125,081.0.5i or Francs 3,127,025.525. The annual rental payable under Article 4 of the agreement to the Persian Grcvermnent for the use and the transit revenue of the line at 4^3 on its capital cost will therefore amount to Francs 125,081,021. Under the same Article three-quarters of this amount or Francs 93,810.76575 will be retained by the British Government and the balance Francs 31270.255525 will be paid annually to the Persian Government in two half yearly instalments. Your Excellency will doubtless agree with me that it duedue as from July 1st, 1907, the date on which the con struction of the telegraph line was completed, and the first half yearly payment fell due on January 1st, 1908. The payment then made was at the minimum rate of Francs 12500 per half year. Further similar payments were made on 1st July 1908, 1st January 1909, 1st July 1909, 1st January 1910, 1st July 1910, and that for the 1st January 1911 is only awaiting the receipt of the Persian Government. On these seven payments there is a balance due to the Persian Government of Francs 21,945 the difference between the Francs 12,500 actually paid each time and the Francs 15,635 now shown to be due as the half yearly payment. This sum will be placed at the disposal of the Persian Government as soon as I learn from Your Excellency that the capital account as herein presented has been accepted by the Persian Government. I take this opportunity of also presenting to Your Excellency a statement showing the amount of the ad vances made by the British Government, under Article 2 of the same Convention, to the Persian Government forthe salaries and allowances ol the staff actually em ployed on the construction of the Central Persia l^ie . This account amounts to rupees 95,561.4.11, the equiva lent of Francs 150,955. I am to add that in connexion with the provision of telegraph offices and buildings along the Central Persia Line, there has been some expenditure under Article 6 of the Convention. A separate account will be prepared of this expenditure and submitted to the Persian Government in conformity with the Note from your Department dated April 5th, 1904. I avail, &amp;c (Signed) G.

Minister of Telegraphs may not repeat his request for the immediate presentation of bill, in which case I would not present it until fate of convention was decided and in case I see no objection to presenting simultaneously claim for establishment charges ; but if Minister of Telegraphs does repeat his request, would it not be wiser to drop claim for establishment charges, omitting them altogether ? Otherwise our chance of ratification, which in the present temper of Medjliss is already doubtful, will be but slender.

I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to enclose copy of a note* by the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, in which * Dated 24th August 1909 with post- pg a ppli es f 0 r instructions with script, dated btn September 1909. J . • « r regard to the preparation, for presentation to the Persian Government, of the account showing the expenditure incurred in the construction of the Central Persia Telegraph line. Subject to any observations that Secretary Sir E. Grey may have to offer, Viscount Morley would approve the view that the cost of providing the third, or Persian, wire on the line should be included in its capital cost, and that the second line, with two wires, from Teheran to Kashan may be considered to be an extension of the Central Persia line from the Indian frontier to Kashan. The proposal in paragraph 5 of Mr. Kirk’s note to make the charges incurred under Article II. of the Convention of the 16th August 1901 the subject of a separate claim against the Persian Government is, as pointed out in paragraph 6 of the note, one of considerable financial importance. The wording of the Convention is not wholly clear, and it is recognised by Mr. Kirk that the Persian Government may contend that under its terms these charges should be included in the capital cost of the line. Lord Morley is satisfied, however, on careful consideration of the matter that the view taked by Mr. Kirk should be supported, and he would propose, subject to the concurrence of Sir E. Grey, to instruct Mr. Kirk that the bill of costs should be prepared accordingly. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, Colin G. Campbell. Foreign Office. Annex. Note by Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated 24th August 1909. The bill showing the expenditure that has been incurred in the construction of the Central Persia telegraph line has been received by me from the Examiner of Telegraph Accounts in India, and it is now necessary to prepare from it the bill of costs in connection with the line, which has to be presented to the Persian Government for their acceptance. 2. The Central Persia line was constructed under a Convention between the United Kingdom and Persia, which was signed at leheian on the 16th August 1901. A copy of this Convention is put up for reference. There are several points, as laid down in the articles of the Convention, concerning which definite instructions are required before the bill for presentation to the Persian Government can be prepared. 7464. b3. In October 1907 I wrote as follows to tire Directoi of^ Telegraplis at Teheran: “The Convention lays it down (Article IV.) that the ^ Persian Government leases to this Department the use of the “ fine, and (Article VII.) that the line is to be of three wires. But, “as a matter of fact, the third wire is not leased to us, and if “ we pay a percentage on the capital cost of this third wire, we are “ in the strange position of paying rental to the Persian Government “ for a wire the use of which is kept in their own hands. It may “ be that it was the intention that this should be done, and as you were “ present in Teheran when negotiations were taking place for the “ concession to construct the line, you may be able to clear up this “ point. It is possible that to obtain the concession it was necessary “ that we should agree to pay rent on the third wire.” The Director, Mr. Barker, replied to this as follows : “As regards the payment of rent “ by us for the cost of the third, or Persian, wire, I have looked through “ the correspondence which passed during the period anterior to the “ signing of the Convention, and I can find nothing to show that the “ position we now find ourselves in was then foreseen. The Legation “ is of opinion that it would be impossible to contest the point now, “ and that we must accept the situation as we find it.” It appears to me that the conclusion that it would be impossible to contest the point now may be accepted as correct, and that the cost of providing the third wire must be included in the capital cost of the line on which the rental of 4 per cent, has to be paid. 4. Under Article X. of the Convention it was agreed that the Persian Government were to be provided with an additional wire along the existing line between Teheran and Kashan. But when this line was carefully examined it was found that it could not with safety carry any more wires, even if it was reconstructed, and that it would be necessary to put up another line of posts if more wires had to be erected. The Persian Minister of Telegraphs had the matter explained to him, and he gave authority to construct a second telegraph line from Teheran to Kashan. This was done and two wires were erected on it, one for the use of the Persian Government and one for the use of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. It will be seen therefore that instead of the additional wire on the old line of posts according to the Convention, we have provided a new line of posts with two wires. One of these wires is used by the Persian Government, and the other by this Department. It was very necessary to put this second wire up for this Department, as without it the British wires beyond Kashan could not be fully worked. It seems but just that this section of line from Teheran to Kashan should be considered a continuation of the Central Persia line from Kohi-malik- siah to Kashan, and that the rental and charges connected with the leheian Kashan Section should be treated m the same way as in the case of the line constructed from Kashan to the Indian frontier. 5. Another question that requires settlement is whether the charges incurred under Article II. of the Convention are to be included in the capital cost of the hue on which 4 per cent, has to be paid as rental under Article IV. Mr. Barker informed me that, having gone carefully through the recoids of the negotiations with the Persian Government in 1901, he cannot find anything which goes to show that this point was foreseen and considered. It seems to me that Article X. of the Con vention might perhaps be considered as giving an indication how the case should be treated. This article shows that the expenditure for erecting an additional wire from Teheran to Kashan is to be borne by the Persian Government m the manner provided by Articles II and TV of the Convention. This reference to Article II. may perhaps be taken to imply that the expenditure incurred under this Article is not to be included m the expenditure referred to in Article IV In Article II the expenditure is for the direction and supervision of the work of con structing the telegraph line, for which purpose the British Governmentagreed to advance to the Persian Government the salaries and allowances of the men actually employed on the work. Nothing is said in this Article how the amount advanced for salaries and allowances is to be repaid. The question therefore for settlement is whether the total amount of these advances is to be included in the capital cost of the line, or whether it is to be considered as outside the expenditure on which the capital cost of the line is to be calculated. In Article III. the British Government agrees to procure the material for the line and to transport it to the sites required, receiving payment for the same without interest as hereinafter provided in the Convention. There is therefore no doubt that the whole expenditure under this Article is to be included in the capital cost of the line. 6. I attach a statement (Annexure A.) which shows what it has cost to construct the Central Persia line from Teheran to the Indian frontier. It will be seen that if establishment charges under Article II. are included the cost of the line amounts to 131,519L If the establishment charges are excluded the cost of the line for the purpose of determining the rental is reduced to 125,081Z., and the difference, 6,438L, becomes a claim against the Persian Government for future settlement. According to Article IV. of thq Convention 4 per cent, on the capital expended on the construction of the Central Persia line is to be the rental of the line, three-quarters of this rental to be retained by the British Govern ment to recoup them for the advances made. This does not appear to me necessarily to imply that the advances made under Article II. are to be included in the capital cost of the line. The rental is subject to a minimum of 1,000Z. per annum, but should the 1 per cent, on the capital cost of the line be more than this minimum the excess is to be paid to the Persian Treasury. With regard to the question whether salaries and allowances of supervising establishment should be included in the capital cost of a telegraph line, I would state that in the Indian Telegraph Department no permanent establishment, nor temporary establishment engaged for general duties, is shown against estimates for works, but when the work is completed a percentage on the cash expended and on the book value of the stores used is added to cover the cost of the store keeping and establishment charges, and the capital cost of the line is fixed when these percentages have been added. But the present case is not governed by the practice of the Indian Telegraph Department, but by the Articles of the Convention and a fair interpretation of them. If the supervising charges under Article II. are included in the capital cost of the line the result will be the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment will have to pay 4 per cent, per annum for 33^ years on 6,438L to the Persian Government, retaining 3 per cent, of this payment to recoup it for the advance made. But this procedure would mean that for the advance made to the Persian Government under Article II. the Depart ment would pay to that Government during the 33J years a total sum of 2,146L, and at the end of that time the debt of 6,438Z. would be considered as discharged. It appears to me perfectly fair and reason able to adopt the view that the advance under Article II. should not be included in the capital cost of the Central Persia line, and that a separate claim should be made for its payment. 7. With regard to the question of rental of wires, I would point out that this Department rents a wire from the Indian Telegraph Department over the section Robat to Nok Kondi, 140 miles in length. This rental includes the cost of ordinary maintenance, and is at the rate of Es. 25'8 per mile per annum. The length of a wire from leheran to the Indian frontier at Robat is 951 miles, and the annual rental for this, at the Indian rate above quoted, would be Rs^ 24,535, or 1,635Z. 4 or the two wires from Teheran to the Indian frontier, and for the third wire from Ardistan to the Indian frontier, 721 miles in length, the total rental at the same rate would amount to 4,510Z. per annum. If the capital cost of the Central Persia line for the purpose of determing the rental to bepaid to the Persian Government be taken at 125,081L as I have proposed, the rental at 4 per cent, on this sum will amount to 5,000L per annum approximately, which is not far out from the rental calculated at the Indian telegraph rate. As the maintenance charges of the Central I ersia line are to be paid by this Department m addition to the rental, it appears to me that if the rental of the Cential 1 ersia line is fixed at 5,000L approximately per annum the Persian Government can have no complaint to offer, more especially as the rental is calculated on the cost of one wire from Teheran to the Indian frontier provided for the sole use of the Persian Telegraph administration. 8. Under Article VI. of the Convention there will be further claims against the Persian Government on account of the rental and purchase of buildings for telegraph stations, but it seems advisable that these claims should be dealt with in a separate account from the one to be submitted for the construction of the Central Persia telegraph line. 9. I would ask therefore :— (а) If the cost of providing the third, or Persian wire, on the Central Persia line, is to be included in the capital cost of the line, as explained in paragraph 3 of this memorandum. (б) If the second line with two wires from Teheran to Kashan may be considered as an extension of the Central Persia line from the Indian frontier to Kashan, and the charges for it treated in the same way, vide paragraph 4 of the’memorandum. (c) If the charges incurred under Article II. of the Convention are to form a distinct claim against the Persian Government, and are not to be included in the capital cost of the line on which 4 per cent, has to be paid under Article IV. 10. If the proposals shown under (a) (b) and (c) are approved, I can prepare a bill for submission to the Persian Government on the lines of the rough draft (annexure A.) attached. It may perhaps be advisable not to present this bill until it is seen whether or not the Assembly wdll ratify the Agreement, that has been come to wdth the Persian Government, regarding the Arabistan lines and the renewal of our telegraph con cessions up to 1945. It is possible that the Persian Government may dispute the correctness of the arrangement by which the charges under Article II. are not included in the capital cost of the line. Postscript. I wish to add to my reference, dated the 24th August 1909, that I find that Mr. Ffinch, then Director-in-Chief of this Department, tele graphed to Mr. Barker at Teheran on the 21st March 1901, for’ com munication to the British Minister, with regard to the Central Persia line, that the capital outlay will probably be 100,000L But in preparing this estimate of the outlay Mr. h finch did not include any charges that come under Article II. of the Convention. It may be reasonably concluded from this that these charges were not to be considered as coming into the capital outlay. Under Article IV. this Department obtains the lease of the telegraph line at a rental of 4 per cent, on the capital expended on its construction, which would appear to mean the amount of money actually spent with this object. The salaries of the permanent estab lishment paid under Article II. would have had to be paid whether the men were employed on the construction of the line or not, and cannot very well come under the definition of capital expended on the construction of the line. 6th September 1909.

H. A. Kirk, Director in Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department. 8th December 1909. Annex 3. Note by the Director in Chief, Indo-European Department, dated 8th December 1909. The accounts of expenditure incurred in the construction of the Central Persia Telegraph Line are herewith submitted for presentation to the Persian Government. 2. In presenting the accounts for the acceptance of the Persian Government it seems advisable that the following explanations should be given :— (а) That the accounts of the expenditure on the work have been kept, like the ordinary accounts of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, in Indian currency. (б) That for the payments in Persia made in krans the rates of exchange between krans and rupees prevailing at the time of the payments have been taken. (c) That the payments in England in pounds sterling have been taken at the exchange of 11. being equivalent to Rs. 15. (d) That the rate of exchange for francs has been taken as Fes. 25 being equivalent to 11. 3. The account of the capital cost of the Central Persian Telegraph line amounts to Rs. 18,76,215. 5. 3. This amount is equivalent to 125,0811. 3s. 5Jd., or to Fes. 3,127,025. 525 The annual rental payable to the Persian Government for the use and the transit revenue of the line at four per cent, on its capital cost will, therefore, amount to Fes. 125,081. 021. Under Article IV. of the Telegraph Convention of 16th August 1902 three-quarters of this amount, or Fes. 93,810'76575 will be retained by the British Government, and the balance Fes. 31,270.255525 will be paid annually to the Persian Government in two half-yearly instalments. It would be of advantage that the fraction of a franc should be excluded in these payments, and that the half-yearly payment should be Fes. 15,635. This rental is due as from the 1st July 1907, the date onwhich the construction of the telegraph line was completed, and the first half-yearly payment fell dne on the 1st January 1908. l ie pay ment then made was at the minimum rate of hcs. 1^,500 pei half year. Further payments were made on 1st July 1908, 1st January 1J0J, 1st July 1909, and a payment has been arranged for on 1st January 1910. On these five payments there is a balance due to the l ersian Govern ment of Fes. 15,675, the difference between the bcs. 12,500 actually paid each time and the Fes. 15,635 now shown to be due. Jhese arrears can be paid when the account has been accepted as correct by the Persian Government. 4. The account submitted for the advances made under Article II. of the Convention shows an expenditure of Rs. 96,561. 4. 11, the equivalent of Fes. 160,935-5208. The settlement of this account will, no doubt, be allowed to be deferred to suit the convenience of the Persian Government, as is being done in the case of the payment due for the telegraph line and cable between Hen jam and Bunder Abbas pro vided by the Indo-European Telegraph Department for the Persian Government. 5. In connection with the provision of telegraph offices and buildings along the Central Persia line there has been some expenditure under Article VI. of the Convention. A separate account will be prepared of this expenditure and submitted later. The Persian Minister of Telegraphs, in a letter dated 5th April 1904, to the address of the British Minister at Teheran, agreed that the expenditure for the provision of telegraph buildings, whether by building them, purchasing, or renting them, was to be a charge to the Persian Government.2 F r ^ b ' • v J L ppendix G ] TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT, 1863 to 1888 . 217 j.

The concessionnaires are exempted by the Persian Government from the payment of customs duty on the importation of materials for the establishment and maintenance of this line andof\ts offices, and they are freed from all local duties. The customs authorities shall, how&amp;ver, have the right of inspecting the consignments belonging to the concessionnaires on the frontier. ... . . 7.

In those places where the lines shall traverse private or common property, the concessionnaires shall enjoy the right of forced appropriation conformably to the laws in force, and to the extent that the Govern ment shall judge indispensable. 8. The duration of the concession is fixed at 25 years, to reckon from the day when the working of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas line shall have commenced. After the axpira- tion of this period the privilege shall cease ; and the concessionnaires should come to an understanding with the Persian Government on the subject of the continuation of their possession of this line. ^ jr j- In the case of no arrangement having been concluded on this subject, all the line constructed by virtue of this concession, as well as the buildings of the stations, shall be given up to the Persian Government without any indemnity. a. The duration of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas concession expiring after the 1st January 1895, the precision and rapidity of the international traffic which depends on the uniformity of administration might be threatened if the Government should take back, at this date, the Djoulfa-Teheran and Teheran-Bushire lines while_ the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas still remained for some time in the hands of the concessionnaires. The Persian Government wishing to avqid this inconvenience, and being unwilling to take back the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas line before the expiration of this concession so as not to be obliged to compensate the concessionaires for the expenses of construction for which they would no longer have any!income, it consents to this that the concession for the Djoulfa-Teheran line and the arrangement on the subject of the Teheran-Bunder- Bushire line be prolonged to the date of the expiration of the Shiraz-Bunder-Abbas line. 10 In return, the concessionnaires shall pay \ the Persian Government for the work ing of 'this concession from the date of the openiritof the line for international traffic during the first half of the 2$ years 1 ,ooo toma\s annually and during the second half 2,000 tomans annually.

It shall be lawful at all times {or the concessionnaires to transfer the rights granted to them by the present concession, with the obligations assumed by them, to another Comoany whose statutes shall have been sanctioned by the Government.

I /220 REPORT ON THE INDO-EUROPEAN [Appendix G Article 4. The concessionnaires have already undertaken to pay to the Persian Government for 25 years (from 1st February 1870 to the 31st January 1895) a rental of 120,000 francs per annum, and in consideration of the prolongation of ten years accorded by the present con cession, the concessionnaires now consent to pay to the Persian Government an annual sum of 10,000 francs besides the 120,000 francs which is referred to above, this payment to commence from the 31st January 1882 and to continue until the 31st January 1905, being the period of the prolongation stipulated in the above Article No. 1.

The final paragraph of Article 11 of the Concession, dated 1 ith January 1868, is modi fied as follows :— In the event of an interruption to the Persian Government wire of more than 24 hours, the concessionnaires will place one working (good) wire at the disposal of the Persian Government for four hours per diem until the Persian Government wire is restored and this without a right to any compensation. And in the event of contact between the Persian wire and one of those of the con cessionnaires, the Persian Government will be authorised to make use of one good wire of the concessionnaires during the said contact and for the period above stipulated in case of interruption. Article 7. The concessionnaires undertake to lend to the Persian Government, in so far as lies in their power, advice, supervision and assistance for the installation of new offices on the Persian Government line between Teheran and Djoulfa. But the concessionnaries have not to bear for this any costs, neither in manual labour nor in material, nor in apparatus, nor contribute towards the maintenance of the offices so installed.

Sir, WITH reference to my despatch No. 93 of the 23rd April last, I have the ( Gulahek, July 15,1908. honour to report that on the 2nd May a note was addressed to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that, before receiving the communication prompted by my representations from his Excellency’s Department, the Minister of the Interior had already taken measures for the repairs of the Ahwaz-Borasjun telegraph line, and that the line would he put in order. „ . T ^ mi i I thereupon requested the Acting Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department to ascertain what steps had been taken by the Persian authorities to effect the necessary repairs, and on the 11th May I was informed that, according to a report from a British signaller at Borasjun, the only portion of the line in had order was that between Borasjun and Kolal, about 8 miles distant from the former ; that the repairing of this section was being wilfully delayed for the purpose of extorting money from the Khan of Borasjun, that gentleman having already been blackmailed to the extent of 300 tomans and refusing to pay more. On the 12th instant Mr. King Wood communicated to me a further report stating tliat at the beginning of June the Borasjun-Kolal section was repaired at the expense of the Khan of Borasjun, that the section from Shuster to Kolal was repaired during the sprint. The signaller at Borasjun is of opinion that at present the line seems to he in good condition, that defects will not he apparent until the rains begin, and that repairs more thorough than the Persian authorities are likely to undertake, or their local officials to carry out, will undoubtedly become necessary. These reports must, I venture to think, he regarded as indicating a colourable fulfilment of their promises by the Persian Government, and as strengthening the opinion recorded in my above-mentioned despatch that until next winter no reasonable opportunity will present itself for reopening the question. I am, however, keeping a careful record of each occasion on which there is a breakdown on the line. (Signed) OHABDES M. MARLING. I have, &amp;c.

Mr.Marling suggests that the opportunity might he taken to negotiate for obtaining the control of the line . even up to Mohammerah. I think that we should most certainly include the whole line from Borasjoon to Mohammerah in any arrangement of control that may he arrived at. If authority is given me to tell the Director at Teheran to approach the Persian Minister of Telegraphs on the subject of the Department repairing the whole line, the negotiations might he opened by his asking the Telegraph Minister (l) what lump sum he would he prepared to give for the purpose of putting the line in order, (2) what annual contribution he would he willing to make towards t&amp;*,upkeep of the line, and (o) for what length of time he would he prepared to agree that the control of the line should remain in our hands. The less that the Persian Minister would he prepared to do under (l) and (2) the more could he asked for under (o). As it is the control of the line for an extended period that is wanted, action,; in the way i have indicated to commence with, may perhaps prove as effective as *as any other. The Persian Minister is well aware, nf the line was repaired by the Department and no further control kept of it by the Department, that in a short time it would be in as bad a condition as it is in at present. He knows any expenditure on the line without the subsequent control by the Department would be a waste of mone;&gt; . xhe present Minister is a man, who is -'avouraole to uhe Britisn, and the relations between him and the Department have always been most friendly.

It will be seen that the survey of the- line and its temporary repairs (if they can be effected) are estimated at some approved council. 18 FEB. )908 Rs. 4500 (&lt;£300), and more permanent repairs, to be carried out later, &amp;£ some Rs , 15,000 (-£1,000) • cost of maintenance of the line , when in order, is estimated at Rs. 9,000 (£600) a year. £&lt;■ ■L I Mi ■The Foreign Office ask for information as to the approximate cost of the proposed survey and tempoi arv repair of the line from Borasjun to Mohammerah. The length of this line is believed to he about 331 miles. As regards temporary repairs the only thing that could be done would be to buy poles locally, if they can be purchased locally, and connect up the wire where it is broken. If there is no spare wire along the line to repair the breaks, and if poles cannot be obtained, this would put a stop to temporary repairs. I think the survey of the line and temporary repairs if can be effected, would cost about Bs .4500(&lt;£j300), There would also be the more permanent repairs to be carried out late* but until a survey has been made it is impossible to es timate what these would cost, I should say tuat an expenditure of some Rs.15000 (£1000 ) would be required for the purpose. As to the cost of maintenance when the line had been put in order I estimate it would come to Hs.9000(£600) per annum. This estimate is for maintain ing the line much as the Meshed line is maintained at present. I desire particularly to point out that, if the survey is to take place, it should be commenced on an early date, as the summer heat in the districts through which the line passes is very great^making out-door work almo s t imp rac tic able. 7th February 1908.tion on this subject, please quote no. 2761.

I am directed to state, for the information of Mr. Secretary Morley, that Sir E. Grey concurs in the suggestions put forward by Mr. Kirk in the memorandum enclosed in your letter with regard to the lines on which it would be desirable to approach the Persian Government in the matter. Before however sending instructions to Mr .Marling it will be necessary to obtain the sanction of the Treasury to the charge of half the expenditure to Bri tish funds. I am accordingly to enquire whether Mr. Morley is able e Under Secretary of State India Office.^ 1 1 &gt;r. * able to furnish any information as to the approximate cost of the proposed survey and temporary repair of the line and also as to the probable cost of its mainten ance when put into proper working order.

Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, f\ 1■When the Persian Government is* approached to allow the Indo-European Telegraph Department to repair and maintain the Persian telegraph line I think it should he for the whole line Borasjoon-Ahwaz-Mohaimnerah, and not for the Borasjoon-Ahwaz section only. The first step to take would appear to he to find out if the Persian Government would agree to allow the Indo-European Telegraph Department to take charge of the line. It might he intimated to them as an inducement to do this that a Telegraph Engineer of the Department would he sent out on the line with a small working party to try and effect immediate repairs. This Officer would he able to report on the state of the line when he had gone over it. We should then know* what was necessary to put the line in order and obtain an idea of the cost of doing this. As to the cost of the proposed survey of the line and its temporary repair as far as possible at the present time, seeing the great importance there is that the control of the line should he obtained, these charges could he paid by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, provided the Persian Government first agree to the general principle of giving the control 6f the line to the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Later, when it was known what the thorough repair of the line and its maintenance afterwards were likely to cost, it would perhaps he the most suitable time to arrange with the Persian Government for the paymentpayment of some proportion of the charges. To obtain control of the line it seems desirable to make the transfer of it as free from initial difficulties as possible for the Persian Government, who appear to want the use of an efficient line badly at the present time.%(*)£}/&lt;) In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote 41817.

I am to state that Sir E.Grey considers that it would be desirable to take advantage of the present opportunity of attempting to obtain control of this line for the Indo-European Telegraph Department, it being as Mr. Morley is aware, most im portant apart from the desirability of securing a more efficient service, to prevent this line passing into other hands. Sir E.Grey, therefore, proposes, if Mr. Morley concurs. The Under Secretary of State, India Office.proach the Persian Government in the matter I am. Your most obedient. humble Servant,^cC^y^a- The British Minister at Teheran is of opinion that an express contract or concession for a new foreign telegraph line in Persia woizld be difficult to obtain at present. He thinks, however, it might be possible by private contract with the Persian Minister of Telegraphs to con struct a new line or repair an old one, if we are ready to provide the material and the supervision, trusting for payment to the returns from the line. But any new line so constructed or any old line so repaired would be a Persian Government line, and very little of the revenue earned by it can under our existing agreements come to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, por messages originating and terminating in Persia the Per sian Administration is paid all the charges* prom messages over a Persian Government line that come from or go to other countries this Department can claim a very small proportion of the Persian terminal rate, and this only on messages which may pass over some section of the Departmental lines* The returns from any Persian Crown line to this Department would be very small. The accounts of 1906-07 for the Teheran Meshed line furnish a striking example of this, as the maintainance of the line for the year cost us between £800 and £900, while the revenue we obtained from it is estimated to have been about £80. As the Telegraph Administration is farmed out to the Persian Minister presumably he can make what arrangements he likes for maintaining the lines and offices*4 offices, H© might therefore agree to allow this De partment to maintain a section of his lines for him, but it would be necessary, it appears to me, if there is to be any adequate payment from him for this, that this payment should be of some fixed amount. It would be difficulty with a view to payment from traffic earnings to arrange by a private contract to get outside the conditions for the treatment of the revenue of the line, as laid down in the Telegraph Conventions with Persia. It seems doubtful whether we could get the Persian Minister of Telegraphs to pay a fixed amount for the upkeep of a line, but he might be sounded as to his views on the subject with regard to our maintaining the Mohammerah-Ahwaz-Borasjun line for him in an efficient state. The Persian Adminis tration has had its Teheran-Meshed line maintained on such favourable terms for itself that it is likely it will have strong objections to accept less advan tageous terms for the maintenance of any other line. This Administration has had fault found with it at times by the Persian Government for the bad working of the Mohammerah-porasjoon line, but now the telegraph service over the line is reported to be greatly im proved, so that the Administration probably considers there is no need for its own purposes to alter its present working arrangements on the line. One reason for obtaining control of this line is to prevent its possible transfer to German hands. Sir C ( Spring- Rice thinks the Persian Government would be willing toto put the maintenance of a telegraph line into our hands in order to secure an efficient telegraph service at small expense to themselves* It would probably be safer therefore for us to deal with the Persian Government, though it might be advisable to use the Persian Minister of Telegraphs as an intermediary in the negotiations, as it is very greatly to his interest to have an efficient line, and the increased revenue that it would put into his hands* MthOctober 1907(B) afcayrnc* tl^u-Th It v *eul&lt;i, at -^rasreat liiomat, a*: t: e Part tans Vr osiselvat aclcaorla i^e, he ot the ••atost. service to Persia* it ^in # X ui ink, t-.f&gt; 4 &gt;or '• iMo, l-.y private arrange- ment with v e Mini star of Xfcle-xravtf.-.e* to ca.es-vruc a line or repair an old one, .if ??e are r^r:iy to rjrovidc the raterial and the supervision, truatinp; for .parent to the returns frm\ the line. : 3Uv a forr?i contract or concession r-all excite discuss ion in the A&amp;mmhly and would arobeldy be rejected.

It will be seen from the accompanying copy of a report from the Comptroller and Accountant General of this Department that the rate would be 2.145 francs only (or l/9) The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.6 d (or l/9) and that if the Turkish Administration ac cepted a transit rate of 70 centimes, as in the case of Persian telegrams sent by other direct routes, the rate would be 1.845 francs only, or practically * / S / d X the same as via Russia (1.825 francs, or 1/6) I am also to point out, with reference to para graph 3 of the Vice-Consul*s despatch, that while terminal private messages in secret language are not accepted for transmission to or trcm places in Turkey, the Turkish Administration is bound under Article 6 of the International Telegraph Convention to accept messages in secret language in course of transit through Turkey.

I have the honour to forward copy of a Despatch from the Resident at Bushire on the subject of telegraphic communication between Mohammerah and Europe. -i i x. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz suggests that steps should be taken to improve the line from Ahwaz to Borasjun. r. * -i i nno The India Office in its letter to your Department of Ibth April 190A stated that the Indian Government was not prepared to vote a subsidy for that purpose. The Persian Government will not produce the necessary funds and, therefore, it is hardly to be hoped that the existing line will ever be in permanent working order. There remains the alternative of a cable to Fao for which the consent of the Jurkish Government would have to be obtained. The line could be constiucted for 30 miles in Persian territory to a point opposite Fao from which a cable could be constructed to connect with the English Office.

I have the honour to refer to a correspondence ending, as far as this Office is concerned, with my letter No. 85, dated 15th February 1905, relating to the question of securing reliable telegraphic communication with Ahwaz. 2. The occasional opportunities which have occurred during recent months of sending telegraphic messages to England via Borasjun, have called attention to a point of commercial consideration which has not, I think, been previously noticed. This is, that if as proposed, connection were established between Ahwaz, Muhammerah, and Fao, the rates would, under the existing tariff between Fao and Europe, be considerably higher than those via Borasjun. In the latter case the rate from Ahwaz to London via Julfa, the route used, is krans 4.80 (Is. 9d.) a word, while from Fao (not Ahwaz) to London is 3 francs per word. 3. Another point worthy of notice is that private cypher messages are not accepted by the Turkish Office at Fao, while they are permitted over purely Persian lines. A hether messages from, say, Ahwaz would necessarily pass through the Turkish Office, as ones from Basra do, I am uncertain. 4. 1 think reference to these two points should be added to the file on the subject, in case a time should ever come for taking action on the decisions already arrived at. I understand that, with these two draw backs m existence, the commercial community would prefer a European run line via Borasjun to one via Fao. In spite of the English-knowing operators the Persian lines are, for afl practical purposes, almost as useless as before, being usually out of working order. I have, &amp;c., 1). L. R.

Captain Lorimer points out that: (a) Connection with Europe would be cheaper via Persian than Turkish offices. (b) That private cypher messages are not accepted by the Turkish line, whereas they are on the Persian system.His observations are to the point, and I therefore communicate them to the Government of India ; but, with reference to his concluding para graph, I fear that the Ahwaz-Borasjun line will never work satisfactorily unless it be taken over by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. I am forwarding a copy of the correspondence to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, for information, under my office No. 32/578, of to-day’s date. I have, &amp;c., P. Z.

In reply to your letter of the 19th June 1907. No. 18,8o5, as to the improvement of the telegraphic communication between Moham- merah and Europe, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to enclose a * 7 copy of a Secret Letter^' from the °' ‘ Government of India, dated the 9th May, reviving the suggestion that the Mohammerah-Ahwaz-Borasjun line should be brought under British control. A note by the Director-in- Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated the 17th June 1907, on the subject is enclosed. It appears doubtful from paragraph 2 (3) of the Note whether the connection between Mohammerah and Fao suggested in the Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, of the 4th May, No. 93, would, apart from the objections pointed out in Captain Lorimer s letter of the 13th February, be worth making unless the line from Mohammerah to Borasjun was in efficient working order. But it is stated in the Despatch that the Persian Government cannot be expected to provide the necessary funds for this purpose. In these circumstances it seems to Mr. Morley that if anything is to be done it should be in the direction of bringing the Mohammerah- Borasjun line under the control of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, as recommended by the Government of India, by some such arrangement as is suggested by Mr. Kirk. . The political advantages of such an arrangement, if it can be ettected, are unquestionable ; and if Sir Edward Grey thinks it expedient to give effect to the proposal, Mr. Morley would be prepared to submit to the Council of India that half the cost should be borne by Indian revenues, the British Treasury bearing the other half. Before, however, the matter is considered further it seems desirable to ascertain whether there is any prospect of the Persian Government agreeing in present circumstances to grant any further privileges to foreigners. I have, Ac., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Foreign Office. Annex. Note on Proposal that the Indo-European lelegraph Department should obtain charge of the Mohammerah-Borasjun telegraph line. The Government of India consider that, until the line from Moham- merah to Borasjun is taken over by the Indo-European TelegraphDepartment, it will never work satisfactorily. They ask that, in consideration of the political and commercial disadvantages attaching to the disorganised condition of the existing Persian line, such measures, as may seem suitable, may be taken by His Majesty’s Government to induce the Persian Government to improve its management. 2. If Turkey and Persia were countries that took ordinary interest in telegraphic inter-communication, there are three routes by which this communication could readily be carried on at the present time :— (1.) The most northern of these is the one known as the Pachkaleh route. A line by this route would give the most direct communication between Constantinople and Teheran. The Turks have brought their line to Bachkaleh near to the frontier, but the Persians appear not to have taken their line beyond Dilman towards the frontier, so that a gap exists between the lines. The Turks evidently intended that this gap should be bridged, as they have notified a transit rate for messages by the Bachkaleh route, so that the delay in opening the route presumably rests with the Persians. The Managing Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Company has informed me confidentially that, owing to the danger that this route might come under control of the Germans, his Company is trying to come to an arrangement with the Persian Govern ment to ti ansfer the charge of the section to it. The Company would then complete the line to the Persian frontier and connect it with the Turkish telegraph system. The Company is prepared to pay, to a reasonable extent, for the concession it wants. (2.) The second route for inter-communication between Persia and Turkey is the one via Khanikin, which may be called the central route on the frontier of the two countries. The Persian section of the line is at present worked in an inefficient way by the Persian Telegraph Admmistiation, but, according to the Telegraph Conventions, it can be token over by the Indo-European Telegraph Department at any time. This agreement, however, would cease in 1925 under present arrange ments unless it is extended. In any case the transfer of the control of the line to the Germans is blocked until 1925. (3.) The third or southern route, which so far neither country appears o ha\ e had any desire to adopt, would be a short telegraphic connection between the towns, which lie some 20 miles apart, of Basrah in Turkey and Mohammerah m Persia. The adoption of the route would require eisna to maintain and work its line from Borasjun to Mohammerah efficiently. Possibly the route might commend itself to the Germans and they might offer to take over and work the lines for the Persian Government. It would, perhaps, be advisable on this account as well as for commercial and other political reasons, to obtain from the Persian Government permission for the Indo-European Telegraph Department to control the Mohammerah-Ahwaz-Borasjun line, in the way it now controls the line between Teheran and Meshed. There appears to be httie doubt that German influence is at work to obtain control of some effective route between Turkey and Persia for German telegraph extension eastwards, and it would seem sound policy that any such routes should be closed as far as it is m our power to arrange this 3. It has to be noted that the control of the Meshed line from leheian by the Indo-European Telegraph Department is one that can be put an end to at any time by the Persian Government. It seems very desirable, if the Indo-European Telegraph Department is to pay for putting m order and maintaining in an efficient state the line from Mohammerah to Ahwaz, some 75 miles, and the line from Ahwaz to Borasjun, some 256 miles, that there should be a time clause in the agreement The Government of India in their Despatch state that the question of taking over the control of these lines might, perhaps be conveniently included in the negotiations that may be opened with the lersian Government on the subject of the renewal of the telegraph conventions. Should this be done, it would seem desirable that thecontrol over the Mohammerah-Borasjun section should be obtained for the full period up to which the Conventions may be renewed. 4. If the control of the Mohammerah-Borasjun line is obtained, it shoidd not be long before it is made to work efficiently. When this is brought about it ought not to be difficult to show to the Turkish and Persian Governments the advantages there would be to telegraphic communication between the two countries, of a connection between Basrah and Mohammerah. This connection is known to be much desired by the commercial communities of the two towns. Should telegraphic communication be established between the two towns, and when its value was recognised, the arrangement might perhaps be proposed of doing away with the Fao telegraph office altogether, if there should be no political objections at the time to this course being adopted. The proposal might be to remove the Bushire cable’s landing place from Fao to some point in Persian territory at the Gulf end of the Island of Abadan. From a cable house there a land line would be required, some 40 miles in length, to Mohammerah. The British controlled office at Mohammerah would then be in a position to exchange all traffic, whether local or international, with the Turkish office at Basrah. The Turks would be saved the cost of maintaining their office at Fao. The buildiug there is in a very dilapidated state, and although the Turkish Government have given orders to build a new office, that does not necessarily mean that anything will be done. Fao is an unhealthy station situated in a swamp, and as far as the British telegraph staff is concerned, it would be well if the telegraph office there were closed. This Department pays about Rs. 1,000 a month in establishment charges at Fao, and probably half of this would be saved by moving to Mohammerah and making it the frontier station for exchange of telegrams. At present only some 45 to 50 messages on an average per diem pass between Bushire and Fao. It is true that for messages that would pass through Mohammerah from and to the Persian Gulf stations and beyond the Persian Administration could claim a transit charge which is not paid on similar messages now transmitted through Fao. But an arrangement to relinquish this charge might probably be brought about by some concession with respect to transmitting Persian traffic between Bushire and Mohammerah over the Departmental cable at lower rates. 5. Should it be arranged for the landing place of the Bushire cable to be at the Gulf end of the Abadan Island, it would be a suitable point from which to lay a cable to Koweit, if the necessity for this connection arose. 6. The Persian Government give a contribution of 15,000 krans (about 266L), per annum, for the maintenance of the Meshed telegraph line. In any arrangement that may be come to for the transfer of the Mohammerah-Borasjun line to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, the Persian Government shoidd be required, if possible, to promise an annual contribution towards the upkeep of the line, and also the payment of a lump sum for the purpose of putting the line in order to start with. The time appears to have arrived for the line to be brought under British control, and the Government of India have again expressed their wish that this should be done. If it be decided that this transfer should be brought about, the usual action might be taken with the Foreign Office. The Persian Minister of Telegraphs will probably be found anxious to do what is in his power to further the acceptance by the Persian Government of the proposal, as the bad management of the line is known to have brought down reproof from that Government on the native Telegraph Department.

It seems very desirable, if the Indo-European Telegraph Department is to pay for putting in order and maintaining in an efficient state the line from Mohammerah to Ahwaz, some 75 miles, and the line from Ahwaz to Borasjun, some 256 miles, that there should be a time clause in the agreement.

I have the honour to forward copy of a despatch from the Resident at Bushire on the subject of tele graphic communication between Mohammerah and Europe. His Majesty’s Vice Consul at Ahwaz suggests that steps should be taken to improve the line from Ahwaz to Borazjun. The India Office in its letter to your depart ment of April 16th, 1902, stated that the Indian Gov ernment was not prepared to vote a subsidy for that purpose. The Persian Government will not produce the necessary funds and therefore it is hardly to be hoped that the existing line will ever be in perman ent working order. There remains the alternative of a cable to Pao for which the consent of the Turkish Government would have to be obtained. The line could be constructed for thirty miles in Persian territory to Grey, Bart., M.P. ., &lt;SiC . , &amp;C • Sir Edward &amp;cto a point opposite Fao from which a cable could he con structed to. connect with the English Office.

'#1 2• Mohammerah is at present connected with tha main . telegraph line from Bushire to Tehran by a line mnnin. through Nasiri, Ram Hormuz, Dilam, Bunder Rig to Borasjun. This line, which is entirely in Persian hands, is maintained in very bad order, and is, as Major Burton says, constantly interrupted, W 3. I find it difficult to offer any useful comments on Major Burton*s letter.

Burton, His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Vice Consul at Mohammerah, To - Lieutenant Colonel C. A* Kemball, C. !• Offg, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour, in continuation of my note on the subject in my last memorandum on Mohammerah affairs, to bring to your notice the necessity of putting Mohhmerah in tele graphic communication with the outer world, if any sort of development is to be hoped for, or expected, in the trade of Arabistan. Mohammerah has now no means of communication with Turkey, except by the weekly British India steamer. Residents and merchants are put to continual expense for runners to Basrah: speedy notification of cargo space and requirements 1 from and to Basrah is not possible. Communication with the rest of Persia also is precarious, the long and tortuous telegraph line to the Central line at Borasjun being constantly closed. The fact of there being one post only from Arabistan to the rest of Persia, and that a weekly one to Khoreriabad thrui^h the disturbed country to the north of Dizful, accentuates the necessity for efficient telegraphic commuuication. A line of 40 miles from Mohamnerah through the Abadan IslandIsland to a point opposite the telegraph.station at Fao and the necessary cable under the Shatt-el-Arab, there about 1,000 yards wide, would appear to be the simplest means of forming the connection. The whole would be in the territory of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and, though longer, would be more useful than a line direct to Basrah or joining the Turkish line opposite Mohammerah: it would also be more easily negotiated, and could when necessary, be entirely controlled by us and communication maintained with India and Europe. The Persian Government would possibly object to paying for the line, but might agree to its being laid at the expense of the British Government. It might appear that the necessity of this proposed connection does not immediately concern us. But I would re present that we are interested in anything that will facilitate the entry by the Bakhtiari or Khoremabad roads of our goods into Central Persia. I consider that this telegraphic connection goes for the development of those routes,together with the points of which I have in my confidential diaries endeavoured to show the ■* j' necessity in connection with the Karun Biver and the Ab-i-Gargar &amp; and the roads leading from Arabistan to Isfahan and Ehoremabad. ,The political a&amp;vatages attaching to this line and its usefulness in the event of complications in South West Persia are obvious: in the letter eventuality it would be a necessityNo. 83 dated Bushire, the 25th March 1904 fConfidential) From - Lieutenant Colonel C.

There would probably be difficulties in the way of a junction with the Fao-Basrah line independently of which a cable across a much navigated river would be liable to damage. In my opinion, the best arrangement for telegraphic commu nication would, be for the Persian Borasjan-Haseri line to be partially taken over, as the Tehran Meshed line is, with one miropean Inspector and a Signaller at Mohammerah and TTasri, there being one at Borasjan, or better the Behbehan-Borasjan Section replaced by a line from Behbehan to Kaseran, the most direct route according to a report by the late Colonel Wells, R.5.Ho. 1779-S.A., dated Simla, the 2nd June 1904* From - C.l.S.Russell, Esquire, Under Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, To - The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. • J { 1) Extract from a letter from Sir A.

The proposal mentioned hy Mr, Consul McDouall was made by me to His Majesty's Government in my despatch Ho. 13 of the 31st January 1902, and in which I reported that the Persian Minister of Telegraphs was willing that the Indo-European Telegraph Department should work the Borasjun-Ahwas-Mohammerah line on the same terms as the Tehran-Meshed one,but His Majesty's Secretary of State for India ’’did not consider that the -Dower of sending messages over the line would be of any benefit to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and that the political advantages which the Government of India would derive from working the line were sufficient to justify the grant of an annual subsidy such as that given in the case of the Tehran-Meshed, one. If, however, the Shah's Government were prepared to pay all expenses, there would be no objection to the loan of an Indo-European Inspecting Officer for the purpose of the line' (Lord Lansdowne's despatch Ho. 34 of Foreign Department Aoril 25th 1904) \ AsAs the only object of the Mukbar-ed-Dowleh in allowing us to take over the line was to reduce the expenses which its working by the Persian Government entailed on him, the proposal fell through. I do not know whether the Mukb ar- e d - Bowl eh would be prepared to entertain it again at present. He acted on his own responsibility during the Premiership of the Atabeg-i- Azam, who entertained ffiendly feelings towards him in many matters as to which he might now hesitate to do so without informing the Ain-ed-Dowleh, and the latter would certainly refer it to the Shah, whose acceptance is, I should say, at least doubtful. But if His Majesty’s present Secretary of State for India is prepared to rescind the adverse decision of his predecessor, I ^ould again approach the Mukbar-ed-Dowleh with respect to itHo. 3943-S.A*, dated Simla, the 19th Hovember 1904, (Confidential) From - The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To - Major P. Z. Cox, C. I. E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I an directed to invite attention to the correspondence ending with my letter Ho. 1779-E.A., dated the 2nd June 1904, and to forward for your information, a copy of a letter from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, Ho. 37, dated 21st July 1904, regarding the improvement of telegraphic communication with Mohammerah. 2. The establishment of a satisfactory means of telegraphic communication with Mohammerah and Ahwaz would be a distinct advantage for purposes of correspondence with the Consular Officers at those places. The Government of India also recognize the commercial importance of some arrangement by which Mohammerah would be kept in closer touch both with Basrah and the London market. 3. Several courses have been suggested;- (1) The taking over of the Borasjun-Ahwaz-Mohammerah line by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. It will be seen from Sir Arthur Hardinge's letter that this proposal was condemned by the Secretary of State inin 1902 on the ground that the political advantages expected did not justify the expense which would be entailed. 1 (2) The taking over of the Persian line as far as Behbahan only and the construction of a new line from Behbahan to Kazran. This scheme, which was suggested by Hr. McDouall, in his Ho. 33, dated the ]■ 16th March 1904, to your address, seems to be open to the same objections as the foregoing. (3) The taking over of the Mohammerah Ahwaz section only and the connection of Mohammerah with the Indo- European line at Basrah or Fao. The latter part of this arrangement was proposed by Major Burton, when acting as Yice Consul at Mohammerah, in his So. 88, dated the 20th December 1903, to your address. This scheme is without some of the obvious disadvantages of the two former. Difficulties might, however, arise from the fact that Article V of the Convention between Great Britain and Turkey of 1864 makes no provision for such a connection. (4) The taking over of the Mohammerah-Ahwaz section and joining it with Ispahan. This project is suggested by Lieutenant Lorimer in combination with the last (vide paragraph 4 of his confidential diary !Jo. 9 dated the 30th August 1904), and there would be theadvantage that the line would run through » r . country of the Bakhtiari tribes, and presumably along the Lynch road. (5) The taking over of the Mohanmerah Ahwaz-Lizful and j Hamadan-Tehran lines, and connecting them by a new line from Lizful to Hanadan, possibly along the orojected road through the Lur country 4. I am to invite an expression of your views and those of His Britannic Majesty's Vice Consul for Arabistan on the various suggestions, v/hioh have been made, in order that the Government of India may be in a position to deal with the question should an opportunity occur hereafter of giving effect to one or other of the proposed schemes.[Confidential] No. 273, dated Bushire, the 17th (received 27th) June 1905. From— MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. M. Fraser, Esq , C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to reply to Foreign Department letter No. 3943-E. A., dated 19th November 1904, regarding the improvement of telegraph communi cation between Mohammerah, Ahwaz and the outside world. Some delay in sub mission of the report called for has been unavoidable, owing to Lieutenant -Lorimer's absence from his post. 2. After receiving the replies of His Majesty’s Consular officers in Arabistan, of which copies are enclosed, I communicated informally with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah with reference to such of the possible schemes as would enable preliminary negotiations with the Turkish Government and have lately received an expression of his views. 3. There are two distinct questions for consideration— (i) The connection of Ahwaz and Mohammerah with Bussorah and London, both for commercial purposes and for facility of com munication with our Consular officers in Arabistan. (ii) The connection of Ahwaz by some means with Tehrah and Northern Persia direct. 4. With regard to (i) there seem to be three possible alternatives ; after the elimination of all schemes involving the extension of Indo-European management in Turkish territory beyond Fao, which, in view of/Article 5 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1864, I take to be out of the question. These alternatives are as follows :— («) That the Turks should open an office opposite Mohammerah, tap the Fao-Bussorah line and deliver and receive messages across the river by boat. This is perhaps the scheme which Would seem least objectionable to the Turkish Minister of the Interior, but h hasten be considered that questions of quarantine might occasionally come in, and Consul Crow further anticipates that the boats taking messages backwards and forwards would be likely to smuggle. This might be the case W any boat was employed promiscuously, but it would seem quite feasible for telegrams to be received and despatched across the river so many times daily at stated hours by special telegraph boat. At Moham merah there would be a properly constituted office for receiving and despatching the messages* (&amp;)- The land line from Ahwaz to Mohartimerah to be taken over by us and continued on to a point opposite Fao and thence be connected with Fao by cable. This is the alternative embodied in paragraph 3 (3) of the Foreign Depart ment letter under reply. In regard to this scheme Mr. McDouall mentions the objections which exist to the laying of a cable across a much navigated waterway. I note however from the chart that just above Fao, beyond ships stopping at Fao, the river can be crossed m 6 or 7 fathoihs'of carter Whtfch I think would give it reasonable security from disturbance. U) The same scheme as (6) except that connection with Fao would be by means of wireless installation instead of by cable. I am unable to say how far communication would be impeded by interference of passing ships with the current.5. Referring to these schemes so far as they affect the Porte, Consul Crow suggests that the Turkish Minister of the Interior should be sounded as to what if any objections he has to Mohammerah being linked up with Bussorah or Fao, and that the line of least resistance should then be followed. 6. 1 have the honour to invite reference here to Article 2 of the 1863 Con vention with Turkey and to the same Article of the 1864 Convention. I infer from the wording of the first that at the time it was framed the British Govern ment had the option of taking the cable as far as Bussorah. Turning again to the later Convention and Article, I gather that all we bound ourselves to do was to bring the cable from Bushire to some point at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. The correspondence leading up to the Conventions may make the point plain but there seems to be nothing in either Article to preclude our landing the cable at Kasbeh, passing it through an office of our own and then taking it across to Fao; and if this is the case it would not be necessary for us to consult the Turks at all. My deductions may perhaps prove to be incorrect. I merely mention them for what they are worth. 7. Turning now to the separate question (ii) of connecting Ahwaz with Tehran and Northern Persia direct [course (5) of those mentioned by Govern ment] l agree with Mr. Lorimer that any such line must follow an established caravan track, and that until the Lurs are subdued and the safety of a route through their country assured, it is premature to think seriously of a telegraph system due north from Ahwaz. 8. The scheme which commends itself to me is one under which we should take over the Borasjun-Behbehan-Ramuz-Ahwaz or the Kazeran-Behbehan- Ramuz-Ahwaz line, as the case may be, and continue the system, at all events to Malamir and, if possible, along the Lynch road to Ispahan. I fear that owing to the high altitudes encountered and the heavy snow which falls, the section from Malamir to Ispahan would prove very expensive to maintain, but I have little doubt that the Bakhtiaris would welcome it under British management, and there can be no question as to its political value. It will be seen from Mr. McDouall’s letter that he simply suggests Kazeran as the place of deflection from the Bushire-Shiraz system because in any case to bring the Behbehan section up to Indo-European requirements, the posts would have to be relaid, and if this had to be done it is believed that the line of country from Kazeran would be less expensive than that from Borasjun. r 9. In conclusion therefore I beg to recommend for consideration as having most potential advantages, a combination of: ** (a) The taking over of the Ahwaz-Mohammerah line and continuation of it to Fao vid Kasbeh. (i) The taking over of the Borasjun (or Kazeran) Ahwaz section and the extension of it, to Malamir certainly, and Ispahan if possible. No, 85, dated the 15th February 1905. From-U^^ D; L. R. Lorimer, LA., His Britannic Majesty', Vice- To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No dated 22nd is Dep ''“ n »- ff 2 * 5 Uest ‘ on . °f. te ^ e S ra phic extension may be regarded as being-vitallv c “''mm 3 ' The following remarks are based on the Commercial aspect of the case, but endeavour is made to indicate where limitations are imposed, or advantages secured by political or financial conditions. 3. As regards Ahwaz there are two main desiderata— (1) To be linked up by reliable line to some main route to London and Northern Persia. (2) To have telegraphic connection with Busreh. All the schemes proposed in the letter quoted above provide for the former, but only Nos. 3 and 4 view the second, the importance of which can hardly be exaggerated. The only two firms which have been established here—Messrs. Lynch Brothers and the late firm of Hotz Hamilton &amp; Co., have both had important offices in Busreh. At the present time Messrs. Lynch’s interests at Ahwaz are largely connected with shipping; but they have no rapid means of ascertaining the dates of the sailing of cargo vessels from Busreh, nor of the space which they will have available for cargo from Moharnmerah. Such information has to be conveyed by special messenger from Busreh to Mohammerah when it has to be intrusted to the* uncertain expedition of the Persian Telegraph, and has to be expressed in the Persian language.. Enough has perhaps been said to establish the advantage of having an Indo-European Telegraph line between Ahwaz and Busreh. 4. As a scheme this connection in itself would be incomplete. It would not give reliable connection with London, as the section from Busreh to Fao is in Turkish hands and its management is, as I understand, far from giving satisfaction to the European firms in Busreh. An Indo-European connection between Mohammerah and Fao, or between Busreh and Fao would do away with this weak link. Giving the taking over of the Ahwaz-Mohammerah-Persian line and the construction of the two lines men tioned, Ahwaz would have all the telegraph facilities which present necessity demands, and a great boon be bestowed on Busreh. The scheme would secure reliable and rapid communication with Ahwaz and Busreh, Bushire, Ispahan, and Tehran. It would give, I believe, an alternative route to London via Busreh (or Fao) Bushire and Teheran, or by Karachi and Bombay. The former route is that followed by European telegrams from Fao at present. On the political effects, if any, of the features peculiar to this scheme I can hardly offer an opinion. I would suggest the question whether a line if carried by land from Busreh to Fao would have any political potentiality. The Sheikh of Mohammerah might perhaps like to tap the wire* at Failiah, • Mohamm«rah-Basra. maintaining a native operator of his own, or paying for the services of one, but this might interfere with the proper working of the line. Financially this scheme on general consideration should be the most profit able. There would be the minimum length of new line and leaving out Ahwaz and Mohammerah which enter equally into any scheme, there would only be one new post, that at Busreh. 1 have not the technical knowledge necessary in order to say whether the Fao station might not be abolished or whether it would remain necessary for the maintenance of the line. 5. &lt; Furning to the Persian scheme suggested, any of these would furnish the desideratum ol reliable connection with London and Northern Persia.4 There being fewer intermediate stations, communication would presumably be rapider than via Busreh, but with an efficient service and an adequate staff, I do not suppose that the difference would be appreciable. As regards the first, or Borasjun, scheme I am not myself aware of any recommendations attaching to it. The exact route is not indicated, but it would probably correspond with the next mentioned as far as Behbehan. As regards the second, or Behbehan, Kasran (Kazerun?) scheme proposed by Mr. McDouall, I must disclaim any precise knowledge. Both these lines in case they were identical as far as Behbehan would touch Bakhtiari territory at Ramuz, where the Persians now have a station, which I presume we would maintain. Whether this and a station at Behbehan would pay for their up-keep is a subject on which I cannot offer an opinion. 6. The 5th proposal suggests the taking over and completing of the route between Mohammerah and Tehran vid Ahwaz, Dizful and Hamadan. It is to be hoped that this route may be secured and completed when the Luristan road becomes an accomplished fact. For the meantime any connection between Dizful and Burujird would be extremely insecure. If the Wali and the Fath-i-Sultan looked on the idea with favour, a line could no doubt be carried through their territory, but not I think without pay ment. There is no doubt that the line should follow the road and I would advise that the scheme be held over until the construction of the road has been begun. In the meantime while there is no trade connection between Ahvoaz and Khoramabad ox Hamadan xt premature to press for the construction of a line on this side. 7. If we are to have direct communication with Northern Persia, the route which appears to me to combine the most advantages is that by the Bakhtiari road to Ispahan. It would correspond with a main trade route and give direct communication with Ispahan and Tehran in both of which places Messrs. Lynch have business, and further provide a short and reliable route for telenraphinn to England. * r &amp; It would lie largely in Bakhtiari territory and if under Indo-European mana gement would, 1 should imagine, be welcomed by the Chiefs. W'ere it possible I should recommend the taking over of the Mohammerah- Ahwaz-Ramuz-Persian line. From Ramuz the line should be carried on to the road at Malamir. A post here or at Deh Diz would be very useful for the forwarding work on the road. _ It is frequently advantageous to forward goods by camel from Ahwaz to Malamir or Deh Diz and there transfer them to mules sent down from Ispahan. Such arrangements are almost precluded by the present defective means of communication with Ispahan, but even with this obstacle it is found worthwhile to make this attempt. This post if at Malamir might be of use to Bakhtianes and perhaps they might be willing to contribute something towards Its maintenance, should it fail to be self-supporting. Malamir might be organised into a transhipping depot. s The section Ahwaz-Malamir could probably be run entirely by camel trans port and the strain on the mule supply being thereby reduced, there would be more of the latter available for the section Malamir to Ispahan. This would I believe be popular with the up-c'ountry muleteers who dislike coming to Ahwaz because of the frequent scarcity and dearness of fodder. The establishment however of a regular dep6t would scarcely be possible without a postal service in addition to the telegraphic one. This would I suppose mean the intrusion of the undesirable Belgian, and could not be considered unless the Belgian Customs should have already independently made good a footing bv succeeding in their endeavours to establish a post at Godar Ba’.utak. 6 1If the Bakhtiari Chiefs desired it and were able to promise some fixed support or to guarantee against a certain amount of loss, posts might be estab lished at other points on the road. The more of these intermediate posts, the more possible it should become to organise a really good caravan service. This digression may appear to be alien to the subject of telegraphs but it cannot be too clearly borne in mind that all that affects the efficiency of the caravan service on the Bakhtiari road, will have a direct influence on the future of Ahwaz and of British Commercial enter prise in this quarter of Persia. Knowing nothing of the practical management of telegraph lines I should imagine that intermediate posts would be necessary, in any case, for purpose of inspection and repair of the line on such a lengthy route in a mountainous country where at certain seasons snow and rain have to be reckoned with As regards the political value of this road I can have nothing to suggest which will not have already occurred to your mind, unless it be that improved means of communication between the Bakhtiari Chiefs and the Sheikh of Moham- merah might lend itself to the easier adjustment of the small disputes which from time to time give rise to friction between them. The spirit in which the Bakhtiari Chiefs met the proposal if made to them, would to some extent be an indication of the political value which the line would possess. Turning to financial consideration there ought to be a considerable quantity of messages to be carried between Arabistan, Ispahan and Teheran, but except in so far as increased facilities would induce increased correspondence this traffic would be merely taken away from the Indo-European-Bushire-Ispahan line. Posts on the road could not be expected to be financially successful on their own merits. 8 . Viewing the question as a whole I would strongly recommend the linking up of Mohammerah with Busreh and Fao. This alone with the assumption of the line between Ahwaz and Mohammerah would meet the prime necessities of the case. The practicability of this is however extremely doubtful. In the meantime every argument urges the securing for Mohammerah- Ahwaz a reliable and efficient telegraphic connection with Northern Persia and England. At the present moment telegraphic connection with London can hardly be said to exist owing to the impossibility of telegraphing in cypher. It is therefore impossible for a firm in Ahwaz to be in touch with the Home market. This connection could be affected by any of the Persian schemes mentioned. It appears that the Home Government demands that the line shall have some distinct political value. Putting aside the Hamadan-Ispahan route as impracti cable of those remaining only the Ramuz-Ispahan route appears to afford the prospect of any political advantages. Granted the good will of the Bakhtiaries I have no hesitation in recording my opinion in favour of working with the object of securing the management of the line from Mohammerah via Ahwaz to Ramuz and permission to construct a new line from Ramuz via the chief points on the Bakhtiari road to Ispahan. 10. If the requirement of political advantages were waived purely com mercial interests would direct our efforts in the direction in which they are most likely to succeed at the earliest days. 11. It may appear from what has been written as though if both the Busreh- Fao and one of the Persian schemes were put into effect, one of them would be redundant. I do not think that this would be the case. The business activity of Busreh ought to guarantee the one and the import ance of Ahwaz as a port for middle and Northern Persia (ever, as it may be hoped, increasing) especially if supplemented by local political advantages would provide a raison-d’&amp;tre for the other.6 No. 104, dated the 29th December 1904. From—W. McDouall, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, To— Major P. Z. COX, C.I E., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In reply to your No. 1556, dated 22nd instant, regarding telegraphic communi cation with Mohammerah, I have the honour to report that the line between Ahwaz and Borazjun is of little use in the winter due to the character of the ground and anew line from Behbehan to Kazran would probably be less expen sive. I have not seen the country but a full report was given in a letter No. 459- I. E., dated 18th April 1891, from Director-General, Telegraphs, to the Govern ment or India, Public Works Department, a copy of which was returned to the Consulate-General, after perusal, in my No. 35, dated 18th June 1891. In any case it would probably be found necessary, if the line were taken over, to entirely relay it as the posts Zanzibar poles (chandals) are too short to allow them to be planted sufficiently deep in the ground, and they are liable to be knocked down by animals rubbing against them or blown down when the soil has been softened by rain. M. Dambrain proposed to work the line in Latin character a short time daily and the Customs has ready two employes who have been telegraph signallers. This has not been carried out but probably would be if the Persian Telegraphs be taken over by the Belgians. However unless the line were kept in proper repair, it would be useless except in dry weather. Connection with Fao or Bussorah might possibly be made by wireless tele graphy if the Turks would consent and such connection would be preferable and would secure a certain amount of local traffic. If the Dizful-Khuramabad route should ever be made safe and that road opened to regular traffiic, a line would be desirable from Dizful to Burujird via Khurramabad connecting with the Burujird-Hamadan line or following the road via Sultanabad to Kum ; such a line if there were a connection through Moham merah with the Gulf system would give an alternative route from Bushire to Tehran. The only other suggestion is that the Turks should open an office on their line from Fao to Bussorah at the nearest point to Mohammerah, which would be some two and-a-half miles from the town. This, as far as I know, has never been proposed. G.C.PreM,Sl«n!a.-No.C334 F. D.-a-y-oC-ei.-R. B.Copy. Enclosures inF.C. covering letter of Dec.28, 1905 ilo. 253.

Persian Gulf.) Mj O'j w Bagdad, December 22, 1903. iOLK Lornslup will have learnt, from earlier reports which I have had the honour to address to you, that I took advantage of my visit to the soutli of Persia to make a short excursion up the Paver Karim to Ahwaz, where I discussed with Mr. \\ ilson the representative of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, the chief questions atiecting the local interests of that firm. Mr. Wilson’s principal complaint was with reference to a transhipment fee of I think, 5 shahis (a penny and a fraction, i.e., V125d.) per package imposed by the Customs on all goods transferred at Mohammerah from seagoing to river steamers This charge was, he asserted, in reply to my inquiry, levied whether the goods had paid duty at Mohammerah or were to pay it at the inland custom-houses of Shuster and Ahwaz, but, from information obtained by me in other quarters, I am inclined to think that he was under a misapprehension in this respect, and that it is not enforced in the case of goods which have actually paid duty at Mohammerah. The contention of the Customs (if the above conjecture is correct) would, I anticipate, be that in the case of goods consigned to Ahwaz or Shuster (100 and 150 miles up the river) on which duty was only to be paid at one or other of those places, it was necessary to secure that they should not be tampered with during their transit from the seagoing to the river steamer, as well as between Nasri and Ahwaz, where they have, owing to the rapids, to be transferred from one river steamer to another; that for this purpose the transhipment or transhipments must be effected under the supei\ision of a Customs officer, and that the latter, or rather his Department, is entitled to remuneration for the time and. labour given by him to this service. “ We have,” they would, I imagine, argue, “in order to meet the wishes of Messrs. Lynch, maintained inland custom-houses up the river at some expense and inconvenience to ourselves; but, if goods are only to pay duty when they reach inland towns, we must exercise some supervision over them during their passage up the river from the port of entry, and for this trouble we charge a trifling fee. If they object to pay it, let theai declare the goods and pay duty at Mohammerah, after which they are free to dispose of them at their will.” It this should be the line taken by M. lS T aus it would, as I pointed out to Mr. M ilson, be rather difficult to argue that the “transhipment fee,” which can easily be avoided by the payment of duty at Mohammerah, is a violation of the Anglo- Persian Commercial Convention, but, before approaching his Excellency on the subject, I should be glad to be favoured with your Lordship’s views. In the case of Messrs. Lynch’s steamers going up the Euphrates and Tigris from Bussorah to Bagdad, no transhipment fee is charged by the Turks, and no super vision is exercised by them over the transfer of goods paying duty on arrival at Bagdad from ocean to river steamers; but the Turkish Customs have no guarantee, beyond the correspondence of the cargo with the description in the manifest, that bales or cases may not be tampered with during the period which elapses between their transfer from one ship to another and their delivery at Bagdad. M. INTaus would, I have little doubt, argue that the fact that the Turkish Customs were, as he would regard it, careless and slovenly in the matter, did not oblige an Administration conducted on European lines to imitate their lack of precaution. It may, oi course, be argued that the expense of supervising the transhipment of goods to the river steamers should be borne by the Customs out of their revenue, and not by merchants wTio clearly pay sufficiently large duties. The whole question can, I think, be conveniently gone into as soon as we discuss the “ r 5 glement douanier,” when the actual amount of the transhipment fee can, if we decide to admit it as reasonable in principle, be fixed so as to preclude it being arbitrarily raised. The Bussians have unfortunately no interest in the matter, as, so far as I know, the peculiar circumstances of Mohammerah are not reproduced in any northern port. Goods for Besht, for example, all pay duty at Enzelli. [1811 t—2] TMr. Wilson next adverted to the obstruction caused by the existence of certain rocks in the bed of the Karun, two near ftasri and four or five near Kut Abdullah, besides certain minor impediments in the branch of the upper river known as the ll)-i-Gerber all of which he was anxious to be permitted to remove by blasting them with dynamite. I mentioned this subject to the Persian Government some time ago, * and they replied that the destruction of these rocks must be undertaken, if at all, by the Persian authorities. I believe that they are doubtful of the expediency of the measure, from an absurd belief that an improvement of the channel which the rocks obstruct'would facilitate the advance of an invader; but I am writing on the subject to the lin-ed-Dowlch, who is personally acquainted with the Arabistan province, and am proposing to him that the Persian Government should send an officer from Mohammerah, atiMessrs. iLynch’s expense, to blast the rocks 01 supei\ise their blasting bv one of the firm’s engineers. The permission of the Persian Government is neces sary under the Karun '.Regulations for any operation of this nature to be under taken. A third point on which Mr. \\ ilson laid stress was the unsatisfactoi\ postal and telegraphic service between Ahwaz, the centre of the Karun trade, and the i^st of the ivorlcl. He wished the Persian Post Office to organize a post between Ispahan and Ahwaz along the Bakhtiari road, thus greatly reducing the time now taken by letters, which are, under present arrangements, sent to Bushire and thence by steamer to Mohammerah—a very long and circuitous route. This question had already formed the subject of discussion at one of the con ferences between the Vicerov of India and myself which 100 k place during oui Gulf tour. I informed his Excellency that I had sounded M. Nans on the subject at the request of Messrs. Eynch Brothers, but that his answer had not been encouraging, his view being that the profits would not at present repay the upkeep of a postal service alon 0, the Bakhtiari road. The Viceroy said he was far from sorry to hear it, as the establishment of Persian post offices in Bakhtiaristan would ini oil e, soonei 01 later, the introduction of Belgian officials into a region in which they might prove highly objectionable from a political point of view, and in which it was advisable to afford no pretext for their presence. It was therefore agreed that it would be better that I should not press the proposal further, but the idea was suggested of sending the Legation Gholam, who carries the official correspondence with India, once a month to Ahwaz instead of to Shiraz for a few journeys as an experiment during the ensuing spring and summer (the road is closed, as your Lordship probably knovs, in ivintei). As regards telegraphic communications, Ahwaz now depends on a badly-managed Persian line connecting Borazjoon and Mohammerah. This line is, however, con tinually broken down in winter, not unfrequently for a fortnight at a time, and when it is in working order is entirely run by Persian employes, so that all messages have to be dispatched in Persian. Mohammerah, moreover, is, except for it, cut off tele graphically from the outer world, and the only means of connecting it would be a line from Mohammerah to Bussorah, or preferably Eao. About a year ago, I think, I had the honour to inform your Lordship that the Persian Minister of Telegraphs was anxious that the Borazjoon-Mohammerah line should be worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, but that the latter were unwilling to undertake the duty, as the 'profits would not pay the expense of detaching the employes necessary lor the purpose. I do not know whether the ffiatter could now be reconsidered, in connection perhaps with a further scheme for linking up Mohammerah with Eao. The latter might, however, I imagine- be rather a difficult matter to arrange, as both the Turkish and Persian Governments are apparently quite content that their two frontier cities near the mouth of the Euphrates, Mohammerah and Bussorah, should, though only ’ 20 miles apart, have no telegraphic connection whatever. . . Turning to the Bakhtiari road, Mr. Wilson strongly urged that the Bakhtiari Khans should be pressed to maintain it in better repair, and dwelt on the advisability of providing more guards and caravanserais. The great difficulty in supporting Messrs. Lynch’s representations in all these matters is that, largely owing to personal misunderstandings between Mr. H. Lynch and Haji Ali Kuli Khan, and to reciprocal differences as to the interpretation of the road agreement, the relations between them have been very strained, the Khans at any rate professing to be very distrustful oi Messrs. Lynch. I had, however, already written to them as early as the 1 st ultimo from Ispahan, at the request of Mr. Parry, one of Messrs. Lynch’s agents, w hom I saw at Tehran, pointing out the importance of maintaining the road in proper repair, i ihey washed to enable us to justify the imposition of tolls on it, in face of the clauses in recent Conventions abolishing them on all but carriageable roads.liem \ V ll &gt;c 7 W 'ocks bject sting ieces. nder- n m en by earner These and a few other minor points, with which I need not now trouble your Lordship, represent, so far as I can gather, the sum of Messrs. Lynch’s demands in the matter of the Karun trade. There seemed to he no serious complaints of the working of the Karun Regulations; the only one that can be said in practice to constitute a grievance being Article 6 , which prohibits foreign merchants from acquiring sites on the river hanks for their stores and premises, and thus obliges them to lease them from Persians at a higher rent than they would otherwise give. I shall try, when I return to Tehran, to see if I cannot get this grievance to some extent rectified. I received a visit while at Ahwaz from M. Termeulin, the Dutch trader, who acts as Russian Consular Agent on the Karun. He complained to me very bitterly of the unfair treatment which he said he received from Messrs. Lynch in matters in which, in his capacity as the agent of the “ Bussorah Trading Company,” on whose behalf he exports grain to England, he ought, he said, to experience more consideration at the hands of a British firm. I said that I should be ghuR wTien at Bussorah, to discuss the grievances of the “ Bussorah Trading Company with Mr. Marshall, its local repre sentative, but as that gentleman, although M. Termeulin wrote to him on the subject and asked him to see me, did not call on me for the purpose during the two and a-half days of my stay at Bussorah, I am inclined to think that they cannot be very acuteu At the same time X think it would be a pity tor Messrs. Lynch to make an enemy, if they can help it, of M. Termeulin. The latter’s interests are commercial rather than political, and he has not sufficient feeling for the Russian Government, which merely finds it convenient to employ him provisionally, to push Russian objects for their own sake. If, however, he could persuade the Russian Government to place a subsidized Russian steamer, running in connection with the Odessa line, on the Karun, by repre senting, as a commercial man, to M. Ylassolf that the venture would be both commer cially and politically advantageous, he might be the means of introducing an element on to the river which would be as objectionable from Messrs. Lynch’s point of vimv as from our own; and it would, I should think, be worth these gentlemen’s while by adopting, at any rate for the present, a very conciliatory line towards him in com mercial transactions, to identify, as far as is reasonably possible, his interests with their own. . , ,, The Dutch engineer, Herr van Roggen, whose departure lor the Karun 1 nacl the honour to report to your Lordship a few days before I left Tehran myself, was at Shuster during my visit to Ahwaz, and had recently been joined by M. Waffalaert, the BeMan Customs officer at Mohammerah. Being unable to go to Shuster myself wfithout missing my steamer on the Shat-el-Arab, and thus being detained a week at Bussorah I have instructed Major Burton to proceed thither as soon as possible, m order to ascertain and report on the exact objects of Herr van Rogsen’s mission Prom Shuster he will go on to Dizful, where he will try to get into touch with the Sagvend Lurs. , o I nave, otc.

Mr. des Graz to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—{Received September 7.) (No. 112.) My Lord, Gulahek, July 28, 1902. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship’s despatch No. 34 of the 25th April relative to the proposal that the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment should work the Borasjan-Ahwaz-Mohammerah and Ahwaz-Shuster-Dizful line on the same terms as they work the Tehran-Meshed line. As the proposal had originally originated from the Mukhbar-ed-Dowleh, I requested Mr. Barker, Director of the Persian section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, to inform his Excellency privately of the substance of Lord George Hamilton’s letter of the 16th April. His Excellency, while thanking for the offer to lend an European Inspecting Officer, stated that, as the Ahwaz line was at present worked and paid for by him personally, and not by the Persian Government, he could not afford the expense of entertaining so highly- paid an official. His Excellency stated, confidentially, that his great wish was to have the cost of the maintenance of the Ahwaz line transferred from his shoulders to those of the Persian Government, and that he hoped to succeed in this on the Shah’s return, and wished to know whether he might count on the British Legation making representations to the Persian Government in support of his proposal. His Excellency further informed Mr. Wood that he thought that if the Persian Government could be induced to pay an annual grant for the maintenance of the Ahwaz line, in the same way that they now do for the Meshed line, the Indian Government might then consider it expedient to make a small grant to cover the expenses of the European Inspecting Officer, and thus ensure the line being kept in an efficient state.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith to your Lordship a copy of a Memorandum furnished me by Mr. Grahame of a conversation he had a few days ago with the Conhden- tial Agent of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Hadji Sheikh Ali, Reis-ut-Tujjar, stated that the Shah’s Firmans, with reference to the establishment of a customs-house at Mohammerah, had been signed and had arrived at Tehran, and recalled the conversation he had had with, and the requests he had addressed to. His Majesty’s Minister on the 7th April, which your Lordship will find recorded in despatch No. 71, Confidential, of the 17th April. When Hadji Sheikh Ali has supplied me with a copy of the Arrangement he has negotiated on this subject with the Persian Government, I propose to address a note, as suggested in Sir A. Hardinge’s above-quoted despatch to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, making references to the assurances given by the Persian Government in 1897 and 1900 in regard to the southern ports, and in particular to Mohammerah, and the Sheikh’s position as specified in your Lordship’s despatch No. 2 of the 6 th January last. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) C. DES GRxlZ. Inclosure in No. 3. Memorandum respecting Sheikh of Mohammerah and Custom-house. HADJI SHEIKH ALI informed me that the Firmans signed by the Shah in regard to the arrangement for the establishment of a custom-house at Mohammerah had arrived. It had been agreed that M. Dubrain, nowin the Bushire Customs, with a Munshi and two ersian clerks, should go to Mohammerah in about a fortnight; the Customs to be under he authority of the Sheikh. Hadji Sheikh Ali would shortly send a telegram to the Sheikh informing him of Firmans received and arrangements made. He would ask this Legation to send a telegram to the same effect to Bushire, that the Sheikh might have corroboration. He reminded me that at an interview (7th May) between the Minister and himself, he, on behalf of the Sheikh, had expressed the wish that the arrangement of re-establishment of Customs, when concluded, might be ratified by the counter signature of a foreign Legation. Sir A. Hardinge had replied that this would not be possible, but that we could, on hearing the Agreement was concluded, communicate with the Persian Foreign Office, informing it that we had heard that such an arrangement had been concluded on such and such terms and requesting to be informed if such were the case. The answer to the Persian Foreign Office to us would constitute an official document, for future reference, in regard to the present Agreement. The Minister had added that such a course on our part would be rendered more easy by the fact that the Persian Government had assured us that no change had been made in the position of the Sheikh without due notice to this Legation. 1 replied that I remembered the conversation perfectly, and his account wasC V substantially correct. I would bring the matter under the Charge d’Affaires’ notice as soon as possible. Hadji Sheikh Ali added that the Persian Government had conferred the title of Sirdar-i- Arfa on the Sheikh, and was about to present him with a sword of honour. He reminded me of his request, previously made, to call to Sir A. Hardinge’s remem brance the promise that he had made to endeavour to obtain some written assurance from His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Sheikh’s position in the event of foreign inter vention in those parts. Hadji Sheikh Ali said he had intended to go to Meshed on pilgrimage, but the Mushir- ed-Dowleh pressed him. to return to Mohammerah to be present at the inauguration of the new Customs Regime, days from now.

Section 7. No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received February 24.) (No. 13.) My Lord, Tehran, January 31, 1902. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a letter which the Director of the Persian Section of the Indo-European Department has addressed to Mr. Ffinch, on the subject of a proposal made to him by the Persian Minister of Telegraphs that the Department should take over the branch lines from Borasjan to Ahwaz, Shuster, Dizful, and Mohammerah, and work them in the same way as they do the Khorassan one. I am of opinion that it would be of advantage that these lines should be so worked, and they would probably be kept under English supervision in good order. I have, therefore, the honour to suggest that your Lordship should give the Mukhbar-ed-Dowleh’s proposal your consideration, in consultation with His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, with a view to a possible arrangement with the Persian Government. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. Inclosure in No. 1. Mr. Barber to Mr. Ffinch. My dear Ffinch, . Tehran January 29, 1902. THE Mukhbar asked me to go and see him to-day, and the subject he rnooted was the Borasjan-Abwaz-Mohammerah and Ahwaz-Shuster-Dizful branch f xn the former. He wants to know the terms under which we are prepared to take over and maintain these lines for him and work them in a manner similar to that we now work the Meshed line. I said that I supposed that the only terms under which the Government of India will work the line as it stands are that Persia shall pay all expenses; in other words, that the Government of India is put to no expense. He then asked if there is any chance o^ the Government of India making a grant similar to that it makes foi the Meshed line. He admitted that the Government of India gets a quid pro quo on that line in being in communication with the Consul-Genetal at Meshed, and wanted to know if some similar advantage could not be made to accrue to it from the Ahwaz line. I said the only possible advantage to be obtained from its use is as an alternative to, or to entirely replace, the Fao cable ; of course a political advantage may also accrue, but that I did not mention to the Mukhbar, nor do 1 know what the Government of India would think it worth its while to pay for it. The Mukhbar says he pays away money every year for the maintenance of these lines, for which he gets no return—the line seldom being m working order. I reminded him that, at your instance, I asked him a year or so ago the erms on which he was prepared to hand over the line to us, and that he had promised to let me know them, but had failed to do so. The fact is he cannot, or will not, afford the necessary sum to maintain the line, and has no one sufficiently trustworthy to put in charo-e of it while the Shah is evidentlv put out at not being able to communicate with the Governor of Arabistan which is, no doubt, of much importance to him. It sec ms to me that the first thing to be done is to find out if the Ottoman Govern ment is prepared to let us cross the Shat-ul-Arab, either at Mohammerah or BusspraU by a cable or a span. If its consent is given, it will be worth our while to come to an arrano-ement with the Persian Government, if not. the only terms on which we ought to undertake work on the line are that Persia pays all expenses, unless the Govern ment of India likes to pay something for the political advantage as I said above. Yours sincerely, (Signed) R. C. BARBER.
