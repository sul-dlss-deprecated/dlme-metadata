The Political Resident representing the Government of India in the Persian Gulf was called the Chief Political Officer with Force D till September, 1917. His title was then changed to that of Civil Commissioner. Political Officer is the designation of the officer in charge of the civil administration in each of the fourteen divisions of Mesopotamia. Revenue means the proportion of the produce paid to the State either in kind (revenue grain) or in cash. All revenue matters were controlled by the Revenue Commissioner till the end of January, 1917. On the 1st February, 1917, the work, till then performed by the Revenue Commissioner, was transferred to the Revenue Board, consisting of himself and one other member. In the maps many of the names of places are not spelt in the authorized manner. Endeavour has been made to avoid confusion by putting within brackets, when necessary, after the mention of the name of a place in the text, its name as spelt in the map. Rupees have been converted at the rate of 15 to the sovereign, fractions being omitted except when their mention is essential, e.g., in referring to prices. The expression spring harvest (mainly of wheat and barley) means the harvest sown in the autumn and winter and reaped in May and June, or even later ; the expression summer harvest means the harvest sown at different times in the summer and reaped in the autumn. (0 1781) Pk 1260 260 7/19 H &amp; S3 REPORT FOR THE ARMY COUNCIL ON MESOPOTAMIA. 1. I left London on the 14th September with Lieut.-Colonel Sir Harry Verney. On arrival at Port Said we were joined by Mr. A. B. Buckley, of the Irrigation Department in Egypt. After visiting the Delta, Upper Egypt and the Sudan, we arrived in Bombay on the 18th November. We were there joined by Mr. L. C. Porter, Commissioner of Lucknow, and Mr. W. Boche, Executive Engineer in the Irrigation Branch of the United Provinces. Thence I visited Delhi to see the Financial Adviser to the Commander-in-Chief in India. Leaving Bombay on the 29th November, we arrived in Basrah on the 5th December. Having made arrangements for the investigation of certain matters connected with the Port of Basrah, I proceeded to Baghdad in order to settle with the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief plans for the future conduct of the inquiry. After the rest of the party reached Baghdad we made our head quarters there. We were able to visit the cultivated areas on the Euphrates from Shinafiyah (Shinafie) to Ramadi, as well as the cultivation on the Diyalah, and the country between Baghdad and Mosul. We left Baghdad on our return journey to Basrah on the 13th February, halting at Kut and Amarah to see the canals and cultivation in those districts. From Basrah we proceeded by steamer through the Hamar Lake up the Euphrates to Nasiriyah (Nasrie) and Samawah, in which districts are the cultivated areas on the Lower Euphrates. On returning to Basrah we visited Arabistan. These tours were com pleted by the 10th March. 2. My instructions are to report to the Army Council on :— (а) The administration and finance of the schemes already put forward for the development of irrigation and agriculture in Mesopotamia, and their control on behalf of the Imperial Govern ment. (б) Whether, in other respects, expenditure in Mesopotamia charged ultimately against Imperial Army Funds is being duly confined to such services as are presently necessary for the prosecu tion of the war. I am further directed to report how far civil funds can currently or eventually be called upon to bear, in place of army funds, the cost of various schemes being developed in Mesopotamia, including those of irrigation and agriculture, which will largely benefit the civil population either immediately or after the war, and the best method of giving effect to such an arrangement*. 3. We were treated with the greatest courtesy in the conduct of our inquiry by both the military and civil authorities, who did everything in their power to facilitate our investigations by placing at our disposal the information in their possession. Special acknowledgment is due to Mr. E. Burdon, of the Indian Civil Service, the present Financial Adviser to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, and to Major O’Brien, the Audit Officer, Irrigation and Agriculture. Though this report bears my signature only, its contents and the investigations which led to the suggestions embodied in it are largely the work of those who accompanied me to Mesopotamia. Mr. Porter’s administrative experience and profound knowledge of revenue questions in the East have been of immense assistance in enabling us to arrive at conclusions regarding the administration of the scheme for the development of irrigation and agriculture ; his advice has been very valuable on all matters ^ the form in which the report is presented is largely due to him. Sir Harry Verney has not only been a cheerful companion from the time we started from England, but has, by reason of his knowledge of: agricultural matters, his general good sense, and his willingness to make himself useful on any piece of work, however trivial, greatly facilitated the disposal of our business. Mr. A. B. Buckley is not only experienced as a canal Engineer in Egypt, but was also employed at one time in Messrs. Thornycroft’s yard, and later in the Cardiff docks. He has thus been able to supply a very valuable opinion on matters outside the Irrigation schemes. He and Mr. Roche have aided the inquiry by the exercise of their- general knowledge of engineering not only in matters connected with the irrigation of the cduntry, but also in respect of other undertakings such as systems of water supply, electric power, and engineering works in the port of Basrah and elsewhere. Their expert knowledge of irrigation problems has not only been of immense value in the preparation of this report, but has also been at the disposal of the' Irrigation authorities in Mesopotamia, with the result, I have reason to believe, that their advice has been much appreciated. No conclusion or suggestion is embodied in the report on which our opinion is not unanimous. Mr. D. W. Helms, our clerk, has done his work industriously, and to our satisfaction. I am much indebted to the Lieutenant-Governor of the United Provinces for having lent the services of Messrs. Porter, Roche and Helms, and to the Egyptian Government for those of Mr. Buckley. Conditions in Mesopotamia in Summer of 1917. 4. To enable a proper appraisement of the financial and administrative arrangements of the schemes put forward for the development of irrigation and agriculture in Mesopotamia in 1918 and 1919 to be made, it is necessary to give some account of the general conditions prevailing at the time when in the summer of 1917 the scheme for 1918 was devised. The difficulties of the position can only be appreciated on a consideration of the military and political situation at the time. The attached maps showing the culti vated areas in 1918 and 1919 [AppendixI], and the different canals in operation in 1919 [Appendix III will enable the areas referred to to be identified. (C 1781) A 24 5. The problem which then faced the administration was the two-fold one of providing necessary supplies for the army, and at the same time preserving the civil population from starvation. Round the town of Basrah we occupied a block of country fairly well settled and cultivated. We had also under our control a narrow strip of land stretching up to the Euphrates as far as Nasiriyah. Beyond Nasiriyah there had been in the spring no control whatever. This area contains the most fully developed tract in Mesopotamia, and from it the Turks collected the main portion of their land revenue. The tribes here had been cultivating for three years uncontrolled by their landlords, and no revenue whatever had been collected. At the end of May troops were sent to control the Hindiyah (Hindie) barrage, and on the 22nd May a political officer was sent to Hillah, but he had no military force to back him. The Turks occupied the post of Diwaniyah (Diwanie) until the 29th August, and constant intrigues, conducted by a German secret service officer attached to the Turkish forces, were going on with the tribes in the neighbourhood. Further up the Euphrates the inundation canals north of Musayib were badly silted, and a very small harvest had been reaped. The Hindiyah barrage was not under control, and the Turks, while they had done some of the excavation for the canal to be taken off from above the barrage on the west (the Beni Hasan canal) had done practically nothing towards the construction of the eastern canal, now called the Georgiyah, after His Majesty. As a consequence the crops on the Hindiyah branch of the Euphrates below the barrage, which had formerly depended on inundation canals, were entirely deprived of water, and in the Hindiyah district there was no crop whatever. In the Hillah branch of the river there had been heavy sowings in the area commanded by the canals, but, owing to the accumulations of silt and to the scanty rainfall, the yield of the matured crop had been very light. Karbala (Kerbela), and the surrounding lands had been flooded. The cutting of the Saklawiyah (Sakhlawie) dam, west of Baghdad, by the Turks had so reduced the volume of water in the Euphrates that the rice crop sown in the Shamiyah district, situated to the west of Diwaniyah, had largely failed. A certain number of pumps existed in the Diwaniyah district, but they were out of action owing to lack of oil, and the canals had long since silted up. There had apparently been a good crop on the Dagharah (Dighara), but the grain was in the hands of two or three speculators, and the full wealth of the district was for long kept concealed. 6. On the Tigris from Samarrah to the vicinity of Baghdad all cultivation had been destroyed by military operations, which were being conducted when the crop ripened. Near Baghdad rain failed, and there had been no flood on the Tigris for the third season in succession. Cereals and fodder had been jeduced to a minimum. From Baghdad to Kut the Turks had removed the tribes from the river banks and forbidden all cultivation. On the Diyalah they commanded the heads of the principal canals with their guns, and in the Baqubah (Bakuba) area many acres of grain were destroyed by military operations. When in September the headworks of the canals came into our possession, roads and railways were laid down so rapidly that many water courses had to be blocked. 7. The canals had everywhere deteriorated. Thus, in the rich Hillah area at the time of our occupa tion there were 54 canals having, when in working order, an individual command varying from 240 to 22.000 acres, all in very bad condition. The majority are private property, and no control had been exercised over the proprietors. Seven canals had been left absolutely idle for several years, owing to unadjustable disputes between the landlords and tenants. One canal which was the property of Govern ment, had also been allowed to fall into disuse. The rest were badly silted up. The Radhwanyiah canal furnishes a striking instance of the general neglect. It is an inundation canal on the Euphrates capable of commanding many thousand acres, and is in the joint possession of four different families. No attempt had been made for the last ten years to bring it up to a proper standard of efficiency. At the time of our occupation the water channels had silted up to such an extent that it did not command more than ten thousand acres. Such was the situation which led to the inception of the agricultural development scheme in July, 1917. Famine was threatening the civil population, and prices were so high that holders were tempted to sell their seed stores. It was necessary to extend the cultivated area with the utmost promptitude, and it was not possible to secure the increase required without large advances of cash and seed combined with extensive clearing of water channels, and some addition to existing canals. The Scheme for Agricultural Development in 1918. 8. The inception of the scheme for 1918 was due to the initiative of Mr. C. C. Garbett, C.I.E., of the Indian Civil Service. He had become Revenue Commissioner on the 1st February, 1917, and was subsequently given the position of First Revenue Officer on the Revenue Board. The military authorities estimated that, in order to provide for the needs of the army in the advanced area, 90,000 tons of cereals, mainly barley, and 150,000 tons of bhusa (chopped straw) were required. The scheme which Mr. Garbett prepared contemplated the provision of these supplies for the army after the needs of the civil popula tion had been met. It was proposed to finance it from army funds as there were no civil revenues available for the purpose, and therefore, unless the money required could be provided in this way, the addition to the cultivated area, essential alike for military and civil needs, could not be secured. Mr. Garbett estimated that, in order to provide the grain required, it was necessary to bring 600,000 acres of land under crop. He calculated that this area should produce 280,000 tons of grain. Taking the following data as the basis of his estimate, viz., five-eights of a ton of barley and one-fourth of a ton of wheat per acre, he calculated that 220,000 tons of barley could be raised on 352,000 acres, and 60,000 tons of wheat on 240,000 acres. To secure this crop he estimated that a little less than 30,000 tons of seed would have to be sown. He calculated that, if left to themselves, the farmers would sow about 15.000 tons of seed, and that another 15,000 tons must be advanced to them. The scheme, therefore, as originally devised, provided for the supply of 15,000 tons of seed, at a cost of £250,000. The amount likely to be required for clearing water channels was estimated at £20,000, and that for agriculturaladvances at £30,000. The scheme as prepared by Mr. Garbett did not contain any allotment for original irrigation works which were arranged for separately (paragraph 15). The total estimate was therefore £300,000, the whole of which would be recoverable from the landlords and farmers. The scheme was referred by Sir Stanley Maude to a committee consisting of Sir Percy Cox, Civil Commissioner, the Deputy Quartermaster-General, the Financial Adviser, the Engineer in Chief, the Director of Supplies and Transport, the Director of Local Resources, the Superintending Engineer, Hindiyah Irrigation Works and Mr. Garbett. [Appendix F.] The Committee approved of the scheme on the 10th August. By adding to the estimate £100,000 for staff, machinery and transport charges, they raised it to £400,000. They contemplated that repayment in the form of Government revenue would begin in the following June. The scheme received the administrative approval of the Army Commander on the 12th August, and final approval was given by the War Office on the 16th September. Mr. Garbett was appointed Administrator under the Civil Commissioner who was at the outset in executive charge of the scheme. Subsequently, with the consent of the Civil Commissioner, Mr. Garbett was directed to report to the Deputy Quartermaster-General, and thenceforward he acted as liaison officer responsible both to the Civil and Military authorities. Under Mr. Garbett’s supervision the detailed arrangements of the scheme were entrusted to the political officers and the ordinary machinery of the civil administration, aided by a very small additional establishment. 9. In its original conception the scheme provided for the production of wheat, barley and bhusa, and was confined to the areas commanded by the canals on the Euphrates. The estimate of land avail able was based on inaccurate maps. The administration depended upon Turkish records, and the Euphrates area was to a great extent unexplored. It was found necessary to include privately owned lands as well as Government land in the scheme, thus reducing the quantity of revenue grain which would become due to Government. The final forecast of revenue grain was therefore fixed at 50,000 tons. Further difficulties ensued. Tribal disturbances suspended the work of canal clearance on two of the most important canals for over a month, and thereby prevented 100,000 acres from being cultivated. Compensation for this was found in other areas. Our advance on the Diyalah took place, and the efforts of the political officers brought back the tribes to the Tigris. The estimate of grain that would be available for the army was eventually increased by 17,000 tons in Baghdad, and 10,000 tons in Basrah to a total of 117,000 tons to consist of :— Wheat .. .. .. .. .. 10,000 tons. Barley .. .. .. .. .. 107,000 tons. As already remarked this surplus was calculated with reference to the needs of the civil population, and it made no provision for demands by either the military or civil authorities on behalf of refugees not normally resident in the two wilayats. 10. The Chief Political Officer had meanwhile authorized the grant of certain revenue concessions to the leading Shaikhs (tribal leaders) in the Euphrates area in return for their co-operation, and, in pursuance of this arrangement, the provision of seed for the areas commanded by the Hillah canals was guaranteed by the Shaikhs. As a result the amount of seed to be advanced was reduced from 15,000 tons to 6,000 tons, the remaining 9,000 tons being provided by the tribes themselves from stock which other wise would have been sold. The greater portion of the seed required, viz., 4,000 tons of barley and 1,700 tons of wheat, were ordered during August and September from India by the Director of Local Resources. Mr. Garbett has placed on record his opinion that the success of the scheme, so far as it has been attained, is largely due to the foresight of Colonel (now Brigadier-General) E. Dickson, C.M.G., Director of Local Resources, in placing this order, and to his accurate provision of the difficulties of purchasing seed in Mesopotamia without disturbing severely the economic conditions of the country. 11. The amount to be advanced in the form of seed having been reduced to 6,000 tons and, as it appeared to be unlikely that the addition of £100,000 made to Mr. Garbett’s original estimate by the Committee which examined it would be required, the estimate of the cash expenditure involved in the scheme was reduced to £150,000. 12. The greater portion of the seed was, as already remarked, furnished by the Director of Local Resources. His calculation of the cost of importing it from India worked out at Rs. 215 (£14^) for a ton of barley, and Rs. 280 (£18f) for a ton of wheat. It was agreed that the seed thus advanced to the Administrator of the scheme should be paid for at these rates, or returned in kind. The price at which the civil authorities would advance it to the cultivators was fixed by them at Rs. 240 (£16) for barley and Rs. 410 (£27|) for wheat. This was regarded by the Administrator as the lowest figure at which seed could be sold with any confidence that it would be sown, and not sold again or eaten. The local rate at the time for wheat was Rs. 610 (£40f) per ton. It was obvious that the new crop ought to be heavier than the previous one, and that, if this expectation was realized, prices must fall. Had the seed been advanced on too easy terms it would have been sold, the farmer relying on repaying from what he could borrow when prices fell. 13. Another direction in which aid was given to the Arab cultivators was by giving them assistance to repair and bring into use pumping plant in their possession. Cultivation on the banks of the Tigris depends on lift irrigation. The most important form of lifts are pumps. Owing to war conditions these had fallen into disrepair, and there were no workshops available to the public. The Revenue department undertook, with considerable success, to supply the needs of the cultivators in this respect. Pumping sets owned by Arabs were overhauled, and facilities provided for the repairs of broken parts and the supply of spares if necessary. The agricultural machinery section of the scheme was eventually absorbed by the Director of Works. In the section of the Electrical and Mechanical Workshops, 4516 sets of pumps have been dealt with. Arrangements were also made with Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co., acting on behalf of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, whereby oil at an all round rate of 1 rupee (Is. id) per gallon was made available to the cultivators. This rate has since been reduced to 15 annas (Is. M.) per gallon. 14. Thus all arrangements had been made for the rapid and early development of the cultivated area, when further encouragement was given to the scheme by telegraphic instructions received in December, 1917, from the Army Council by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, to do all in his power to develop local resources especially as regards vegetables and cereals, and to give all possible encouragement to military farms and soldiers’ gardens. These orders insisted on the extreme importance of saving tonnage by development and utilization of local resources to the utmost. Meantime scarcity of grain had been, making itself felt, and it had become increasingly difficult to provide for the civil population. On the 17th November, 1917, a telegram was despatched to India asking for the monthly despatch to Mesopotamia of 3,000 tons, 50 per cent, wheat, and 25 per cent, each barley and rice, for the use of the civil population. In January, 1918, the local price of wheat was Rs. 1120 (£74f) and that of barley Rs. 700 (£46|) per ton. This supply from India continued until March, 1918. Expenditure on Irrigation in 1918. 15. The arrangements for extending the facilities for irrigation by means of canals for the spring harvest of 1918 must now be described. As already mentioned the estimate for the agricultural develop ment scheme contained no allotment for clearing any but private canals, or for construction of new ones. This work remained for the time in the hands of the Civil Commissioner, and at first the work of clearing the canals was directed by the revenue staff. Control was gradually handed over to five British engineering officers lent to the Army, but it was not till February, 1918, that a Director of Irrigation was appointed. On the Tigris no direct work was carried out by official agency, but the reconstruction of an important dam on the Diyalah, dominated until September by the Turkish guns, was arranged for by Arab labour through the influence of the Political Officer. The Baqubah canals were also cleared by local agency. In the Euphrates area an expenditure of Rs. 21,00,000 (£140,000) was contemplated. The actual expenditure during the financial year 1917 and 1918 was about Rs. 16,25,000 (£108,333). The area was organized into four districts under a Superintending Engineer. The organization was subsequently in February, 1918, incorporated, with the addition of three districts, in the Irrigation Directorate. A sum of Rs. 1,27,179 (£8,479) was expended on repairing damage done to buildings and workshops by the enemy and on various repairs to the Hindiyah barrage and Hillah canal head. Work on both the Beni Hasan and Georgiyah canals (paragraph 5) was taken in hand as soon as the locality came under our control. By the end of June, 1917, the Beni Hasan Branch had been pro longed to the 20th kilometre, and by December, 1917, to the tail of the canal. The water way of the Georgiyah canal was completed by the same time, but the earthwork on the banks of the canal could not be finished before the canal was opened for use. The opening up of these canals brought 34,657 acres under cultivation for the spring harvest and 32,300 acres for the summer harvest of 1918. This district had been deserted by its population owing to the failure, already mentioned, of the inundation canals. It now bears, as I can personally testify, every sign of abundant and increasing prosperity, and the tribes, who have returned, are now rapidly extending cultivation. The expenditure on these two canals came to Rs. 9,82,863 (£65,524). An expenditure of Rs. 1,95,143 (£13,009) was incurred in clearing 61 branches of the Hillah canaL This work was absolutely essential to the development of cultivation. Had it been neglected it would have been impossible to distribute efficiently the water brought down by the Hillah canal. In the Shamiyah district a sum of Rs. 71,631 (£4,775) was expended on clearing 29 canals and constructing brushwood revetments and temporary dams to assist cultivation. In this district Rs. 93,426 (£6,228) had previously been spent by the Political Officer on Government canals, and this sum should be added to the expenditure incurred during the financial year 1917-1918 on the irrigation programme.. The work thus carried out undoubtedly led to a very large increase in the revenue demand from the district. A sum of Rs. 13,729 (£915) was incurred on maintenance and repairs of canals and channels, and Rs. 1,41,774 (£9,451) on miscellaneous expenditure not directly connected with irrigation. Of this Rs. 68,108 (£4,541) were spent on roads. The construction of roads and bridges would ordinarily be the duty of the Works Department, but, in the order appointing the Director of Irrigation, he was made responsible for it in places where the Works Department was not represented. It waa naturally one of the first requirements of the country and would have been equally necessary in order to tap existing resources had there been no scheme for agricultural development. Such tracks as were in existence were impassable for motor traffic, and much levelling and cutting had to be carried out. Many rough masonry culverts were constructed for crossing the existing water channels and a few of a more permanent nature. The Musayib and Tuwairij (Hindie) boat bridges were also constructed at a total expenditure of Rs. 38,328 (£2,555). The Tuwairij bridge crosses the Hindiyah branch of the Euphrates opposite the flourishing town of Tuwairij, and will be of permanent value to the district. The Musayib bridge is on the road to Karbala from Baghdad. It has been temporarily removed, and the military authorities are under engagement to replace it. Two other small works were carried out by the Irrigation Depart ment the cost of which is included in the amount of miscellaneous expenditure. The town of Najaf (Nejef) derives its water supply from a small canal taking water from the Hindiyah branch of the7 Euphrates. In order to assure a constant supply of water to the canal a small pumping installation was erected at a cost of Rs. 7,282 (£485). Petty repairs to the streets of Hillah town were also done at a cost of Rs. 1,765 (£118). Agricultural Machinery. 16. There are two minor matters relating to orders for agricultural machinery for the spring harvest, 1918, which require notice. The first relates to a dispute with regard to an order placed with the Sunshine Harvester Company, Australia, for the provision of 25 Sunshine Harvesters. The facts connected with this order are briefly as follows :— In September, 1917, Sir Percy Cox requested the Government of India to make inquiries from Australia as to the type of oil-driven reaping and threshing machines most suitable for a flat country. On the 8th November, 1917, the Government of India telegraphed as follows :— [Telegram No. 76055, Secret, to General, Baghdadi] “ Reported by Australia that mobile oil-driven reaping and threshing machines suitable only for flat country being built by Sunshine Harvester Company. One special operator required per machine who attends to reaping, threshing and driving of engine single handed. Approximate price £285 each machine : 50 machines available in Australia. Weight 2 tons : capacity 2 acres per hour if crop 60 bushels per acre.” On this a telegram was sent to purchase 25 Harvesters, each to be accompanied by a special operator. On the 17th December the Government of India telegraphed as follows :— “ Purchased 25 latest type Sunshine Harvesters, eight feet comb, seven horsepower double cylinder engines which drive mechanism of machines, whilst horses or mules merely draw machine through crop.” On the 4th January the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief wired to enquire the size and number of mules required for each machine ; stating that the necessity for a large number would greatly detract from the suitability of the machine, and that, if feasible, he might wish to cancel his order. He received a reply on the 23rd January that 4 mules or light horses were required for each machine and on the 24th January a telegram was sent cancelling the order. The Governor-General of Australia subsequently, on the 7th February, cabled that the contractors refused to cancel the contract. He added that the machines reaped grain only, leaving straw untouched, and were too heavy for irrigated land. On the 7th March the order was definitely cancelled ; but the contractors are preferring a claim for compensation. The original order was given on the understanding that the machines were prime movers and required one man to operate. This appears to be a reasonable inference to draw from the telegram of the 8th November from the Government of India on which the order was based. The order was cancelled owing to the difficulty of dealing with 100 horses or mules and the personnel required to look after them. It does not appear that any blame attaches to the authorities in Mesopotamia in the matter or that they should be called upon to pay damages. The original cost of 25 machines was about £7,500. The second matter relates to an order lor tractors with steam tackle. On the 18th January, 1918, a telegram [Telegram No. Q 2887] was sent by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Baghdad, to the Chief of the General Staff, Delhi, and repeated to the Whr Office, London, ordering ten threshing machines and twelve tractors to drive them. The machines were required to release as quickly as possible the cattle and labour that would be engaged on reaping and threshing the spring crops, and it was stated that material assistance would be afforded if this machinery could be provided in time to deal with the harvest between April and May, 1918. The first of these machines did not, however, arrive until October, 1918, and the rest have arrived at later dates. No invoice has been received as yet and their cost is unknown. The Director of Agriculture states that the type is suitable to the country, and can be usefully employed in the Euphrates area, being moved from place to place as required. The civil authorities will probably be ready to take them over on terms to be arranged, as they should certainly be valuable in educating the Arab farmer, who has a natural inclination to adopt labour-saving machinery. 17. The account of the expenditure on production of grain in 1918 is now complete. It covers only the agricultural and irrigation operations, including the transportation of the revenue grain to the local government granaries. The cost of cleaning, bagging and transporting the gram and bhusa to the centres at which the Supply Department would take possession of it is a separate matter (see para graphs 26-28). The time has now arrived for examining the degree of success attained m increasing the yield of wheat and barley under the scheme. . , i . x- i j. In endeavouring to form a just appreciation of the success attained by measures taken to stimulate and extend cultivation in 1918, one is confronted by the initial difficulty that no reliable estimate can be formed of the area under cultivation, or of the crop which matured m 1917 Mr. Garbett m his annual report has stated The areas matured in 1917 appear to have been about 100,000 acres on the Euphrates to Diwaniyah ; 5,000 acres on the Tigris and 10,000 acres on the Diyalah Of the gross area on the Euphrates 60,000 acres were harvested on the Dagharah.” The data on which this estimate8 was based seem to be very imperfect, and, while due weight should be attached to Mr. Garbett’s experience as a revenue officer and his knowledge of the country, all that can safely be asserted is that, in the circumstances described in paragraphs 5-7, the area on which crops matured in 1917 must have been limited and far below normal. The actual amount of wheat and barley seed dealt with in 1918 was 6,495 tons. The balance of this amount, over and above that purchased from India, was taken locally from revenue grain. Nine hundred and eighty-seven tons proved bad, and the amount actually advanced was 5,517 tons. Some of this was no doubt eaten or sold ; but the results shown by the harvest which was reaped seem to prove that the greater portion of the full estimate of 30,000 tons (paragraph 8) must actually have been sown.. In two respects the scheme did not come up to expectations. In the first place some of the imported Indian wheat did not give the return expected. This was due in part to the Indian seed selected not being of the kind best suited to Mesopotamia, where the climatic conditions favour the wheats grown in the Punjab. In the second place the area irrigated by the two canals taking off from the Hindiyah barrage (the Georgiyah and the Beni Hasan) was far less than was expected. When full measurements were received the area irrigated by the Beni Hasan canal was found to be 20,650 acres and that by the Georgiyah 14,000 acres—a serious shortage compared with the estimate of 100,000 acres. It seems that this result was to a considerable extent due to the ground now brought for the first time under regular cultivation being in many places full of deep fissures, so that a very large volume of water ran down the cracks and disappeared, a phenomenon which should not be repeated once the whole of the area has been ploughed over. The figures furnished by the Irrigation Department show that the area culti vated for the spring harvest of 1918 in the Baghdad wilayat, including the district of Kut, amounted to 393,000 acres on the Euphrates and 140,000 acres on the Tigris, or 533,000 acres in all. Those for the Euphrates area are said to have been arrived at by measurement, those on the Tigris were estimated. Moreover the figures take account of flow irrigation only and do not include land irrigated by lift, of which there is a considerable area on the Tigris, nor rain matured crop. It would be a mistake to place too much reliance on their accuracy but, such as they are, they would, if additions are made for areas which they do not cover, justify an estimate of the area under crop of from 550,000 to 600,000 acres. This figure may be tested by another method. On the smaller area of 550,000 acres the crop calculated on Mr. Garbett’s expectation of outturn, would amount to 256,000 tons. The revenue demand in kind for the spring crop of 1918, amounts to 47,742 tons, a close approximation to the estimate of 50,000 tons of revenue grain to be obtained from the scheme. Government revenue is assessed at l/5th of the produce. Various considerations point to the conclusion that this assessment has not been fully recovered. Owing to the shortage of staff it was not possible as intended to assess the revenue according to measure ments made by the Irrigation Department. This led to delay, and, combined with an apparent unwilling ness for political reasons to enforce the demand too strictly, especially in districts such as the Samawah division where the Turk had in the past little or no control, tended to keep the demand low. It has been suggested that, if the revenue demand be multiplied five-fold and the result increased by 25 per eent- on account of low assessments, a fairly accurate estimate of the gross crop will be obtained. A revenue demand of 48,000 tons would at this calculation give a gross crop of 300,000 tons. It may be assumed with some degree of confidence that the gross spring crop for 1918 in the area covered by the agricultural development scheme amounted to some figure between 260,000 and 300,000 tons. It is not easy to estimate the proportion of this crop which is directly due to the agricultural develop ment scheme combined with the operations of the Irrigation Department. It would be reasonable to assume that, if the clearing of the canals had not been systematically taken in hand, and advances for this and other purposes had not been made from army funds, there would still have been some extension in cultivation. But it seems undeniable that the area under crop has been very materially increased by bhe various methods in which the farmer has been assisted. The distribution of seed has been the chief factor in the Tigris area. There 3,926 tons of seed and Rs. 70,175 (£4,678) cash were distributed. A large proportion of the crops matured in this area can undoubtedly be claimed as due to the scheme. But advances of seed and cash had a considerable effect also in the Euphrates area. Large advances of seed were made in hallujah and Ramadi, in which two districts Rs. 1,04,000 (£6,933) were distributed in cash. In Hindiyah much of the seed required for the area brought under cultivation by the Beni Hasan and Georgiyah canals was advanced ; and such was the eagerness displayed to sow every atom of seed available, that sufficient was not retained for the support of the people. Cash advances aggregating Rs. 89,000 (£5,933) had to be made to keep the cultivators and their cattle alive until the harvest matured. In Shamiyah also, where rice, the main staple of the district, largely failed, cash advances of Rs. 88,000 (£5,866) were made. On the other hand, in the rich Euphrates area commanded by the Hillah canal and its numerous distributaries it was the extension of irrigation which was mainly responsible for the good results achieved. Mr. Garbett attributed two-thirds of the crops on this large area (228,000 acres) to the activities of the Irrigation Department. He considered 55 per cent, of the total area matured through out the wilayat of Baghdad and Kut to be due to the steps taken to give advances and to increase the suppiy of water for irrigation. It would then probably not be going beyond the mark to estimate that at least 125,000 tons of the spring crop resulted from these two measures. 18. It is interesting to estimate the cost of the importation of this amount of grain, basing the calculation on one-fifth being wheat and four-fifths barley, this being the proportion between wheat and barley paid in as revenue grain. The average of f.o.b. prices at Karachi for wheat and barley from July to October, 1918,A\orks out at Rs. 161-7-1 (£10|) and Rs. 131-9-4 (£8§) per ton respectively. The Financial Adviser, basing his estimate on commercial rates and the actual costs of a voyage, considers that sea freight may be taken at Rs. 40 (£2§) per ton. He also advises that the cost of river freight to aghdad may be taken to be Rs. 40 (£2f) per ton, this rate being based on figures supplied by Messrs.9 bJaddedTfl ™r S oent thTnlliT?

Had not the food resources of the country been abundantly reinforced the famine conditions prevailing in the neighbouring territory of Turkey and ersia rmg ave een reproduced in Mesopotamia, As it was, the authorities were able to give succour to a sudden influx of starving and destitute Christians, Armenians and East Syrians, who were driven from their country by the overwhelming pressure of Turk, Persian and Kurd, and fled to the protection of our army in the late summer of last year. This undisciplined horde first came into contact with our mes of communication at Hamadan in Persia, where 50,000 refugees arrived during August, 1918, leaving many thousand dead on their march of 320 miles. The problem of saving and feeding these people was met with amazing success in the face of the greatest difficulties. As it was impossible to look after them at Hamadan a concentration camp was formed near Baqubah on the Persian road, 32 miles from Baghdad, and within easy distance of the advanced base. To this camp the refugees were conveyed, a distance of 250 miles, at the rate of one thousand a day. Here they have been well fed and warmly clothed, and there are now m the camp 42,000 men, women and children, with about 6,000 animals. ^The provision of food of all kinds for this small multitude from resources designed to be sufficient for the army and the civil population was a serious tax on the Supply Department. It would have been an impossibility had the scheme for encouraging the local production of grain not been undertaken. Up to the end of January the refugees have consumed some 2,500 tons of flour and rice alone, and their animals 500 tons of grain and 22,000 tons of bhusa. 19. No less important were the political advantages obtained. For the first time in history the Arab has seen an administration devoting every effort to promoting his material benefit and the regenera tion of his country. It would not be unreasonable to attribute much of the present peaceful condition of the country to the agricultural development scheme of 1918. It seems, indeed, that the chief civil authority would regard this inference as justified. During the disturbances among the towns folk of Najaf, Kufah and Abu Sukhair during the last three months of 1917 Captain Balfour, Political Officer at Shamiyah, unsupported by troops, was able to rely in the rural districts on the loyalty of the leading Shaikhs, who,” the Civil Commissioner remarks in his review of the Administration, “ were actively employed in cleaning out their canals with money borrowed from us, with a view to sowing grain which the British Administration was ready to provide, and who were pledged to the existing order and upheld it.” Mr. Grarbett observed during his first official visit to the rich tract on the Dagharah canal, that the country was remarkable for the numerous fortified houses, and the height of the fortress towers. These occurred at intervals of a bare half mile, and many showed the marks of rifle fire, while on each there was always an attendant sentry. In a later note he related that the tribesmen had, in order to please the authorities, initiated the voluntary demolition of these towers. The face of the district was thus becoming rapidly changed, and subsidies for the protection of roads were no longer given. One of the forts about to be demolished had been erected recently at a cost of £250. To attribute this result to the interest which the administration has taken in inducing the populatiou,to till their fields would be by no means far fetched. Instances could be multiplied. Wherever, indeed, one goes one sees evidence all around of the beneficial results of the agricultural development scheme. 20. Great credit is due to Mr. Garbett for the enthusiasm and Courage with which he initiated a scheme which has so amply justified its inception. The results achieved have approximated in a very remark able manner to those which he set out to realise. His health unfortunately broke down under the strain to which he was subjected, and necessitated his proceeding on leave. The main facts in connection with the scheme were elicited from him during two comparatively short interviews at Amarah and Basrah. There are probably a number of other interesting details in connection with it, which might have been obtained from him had he been in Baghdad, and as to which clear information has not been procurable from the records of his office. Working as he did with an inadequate and undertrained staff, it was frequently necessary for him, in order to meet emergencies, to give directions of which no proper record has been kept. The difficulties under which his daily work was conducted were very great, and the few mistakes made were such as are inseparable from the conduct of a scheme of this magnitude in a totally undeveloped country. Summer Crop of 1918. 21. The results of the summer crop reaped in the autumn of 1918 were disappointing. The sum of Rs. 1,41,448 (£9,430) was expended on advances for rice seed and Bs. 24,643 (£1,643) on other seed for the harvest. Maize and millet were ordered from India. The millet was despatched too late for sowing, and the maize proved unsuitable. The plants either failed to flower or the seed to set. Such millet as was sown from local seed was ravaged by locusts. Extensive preparations had been made for sowing rice in Shamiyah, the most important area for this crop, but, owing to failure of water, only 25,000 acres in place of 100,000 were sown. The crop was further damaged by the abnormally low flood in the Euphrates. In the Hillah district some 40,000 acres, an area in excess of the normal, were sowm (C 1781) B10 Nine thousand two hundred and seventeen tons have actually been secured by the Department of Local Resources, which is sufficient for the needs of the forces for several months. As a matter of fact more could have been obtained had it been wanted. Owing to the local supply being adequate the Director of Supplies and Transport was able to telegraph on the 2nd November, 1918, to stop further supplies from India. 22. The balance sheet shown in Appendix IX deals with advances made from army funds by the Administrator, and with certain final charges for salaries, machinery, &amp;c. It does not attempt to estimate the total cost of raising the crop, or to ascertain the effect of the scheme. In considering this account it is desirable to go back to the object with which the scheme of agricul tural development originated. [Appendix F.] One cannot read the proceedings of the Conference of the 10th August, 1917, without arriving at the conclusion that, as it was intended that the whole scheme should be a military one, the repayment to the army in the form of Government revenue [vide Clause (c)] was contemplated. Indeed any other arrangement, since the money was being advanced from army funds, on which the whole risk of the experiment would rest, would have been wanting in fairness. The acting Civil Commissioner (Lieut.-Colonel A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., C.I.B., D.S.O.) has assured me that this was the original intention, and that subsequently, as he considered that this arrangement gave him no control over the scheme, he directed the political authorities working under him to secure the revenue grain for the civil administration. No written record of any determination that the revenue grain should become the property of the civil government can be traced. But the military authorities have evidently acquiesced in this arrangement, since the question of the rate at which the civil administration should be paid by the army for the cereals received from landowners in satisfaction of the Government revenue dues, subsequently came under discussion. In his telegram of the 17th December, [Appendix VI], the Political Resident referred it to the Government of India, and endorsed the suggestion of the Revenue Department in Mesopotamia, that the rates of payment should be Rs. 280 (£18§) per ton of wheat, and Rs. 168 (£11^) per ton of barley, these being represented as fair average rates in the then existing conditions. It was felt by the Government of India that these rates were much too high, and would give to the civil administration at the expense of the army a profit which was quite unjustifiable. More over, the army had been transporting 1,500 tons of wheat and 750 tons of barley a month to Mesopotamia for the use of the civil population, and charging the latter only the cost price in India [Rs. 175 (£llf) for wheat and Rs. 120 (£8) for barley], without any debit whatever for freight and incidental charges. Rates were accordingly worked out on the basis of pre-war prices in Mesopotamia, and fixed by the telegram from the Government of India of the 11th April, 1918, viz., Rs. 170 (£11-|) per ton for wheat and Rs. 115 (£I|) P eT ton for barley. [Appendix VII.] These rates had, however, been evolved by means of a calculation of pre-war prices in Mesopotamia which was not exact, and they were subsequently reduced to Rs. 168 (£ll-gd and Rs. 107 (£7^). [Telegram Q/5521, dated the ith May, 1918, to Army Department and Army Department's Reply No. 7054, dated the 29^ May, 1918, Appendix VIII.] The telegram, in which the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief suggested this reduction, stated that the Civil Com missioner and the Financial Adviser agreed that these were fair prices for grain taken for military use to date, and that the Government of India would be addressed later as regards the rate for the harvest about to be collected. But no further reference was made on the subject, and, in the report made by Mr. T. R. J. Ward, Inspector-General of Irrigation in India, to the Government of India, dated the 14th May, 1918 (paragraph 29), on the prospects for 1919, he used a mean deduced from the rates prescribed by the Government of India, and after consideration of the proportion of barley to wheat, by which to calculate the benefit likely to accrue to the army from the agricultural schemes of both 1918 and 1919. These rates were also the basis of the calculation on which the profit estimated from the operations of 1919 was arrived at in the telegram from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the 22nd April, 1918. [Appendix XI.] It seems clear that the rate, based as it is on a variable factor, ought not to be applied to all transactions in grain after the date on which it was originally fixed. Moreover, in view of the prices at which the Director of Loc4l Resources has been purchasing barley in the market recently, the figure of Rs. 107 (£7-^) per ton seems to be too high. I understand that the General Officer Com manding-in-Chief contemplates referring the matter to the Government of India in order that a rate may be fixed bearing a closer relation to the market price prevailing during the time when the revenue grain was being transferred from the civil administration to the army. For the present, in calculating the saving to the army from the purchase of grain locally during the harvest, instead of bringing it from India, it seems necessary to use the sanctioned rates for the valuation of the revenue grain transferred by the civil administration. Should the rates at which payment is to be made by the army be eventually lowered, the saving to the army will become considerably larger. 23. Had it been contemplated that the army should receive revenue grain free of cost there might have been good reason for treating the expenditure incurred on the production of grain in connection with the scheme as a final charge against army funds. But the difficulty of discriminating between (1) revenue grain resulting from normal cultivation and (2) that due to the increased output produced from the scheme, is an obstacle to securing for army funds under such an agreement the full credit to which they are entitled. On the other side of the account, allowance would have to be made for the fact that the entire administrative machinery for carrying out the scheme has been provided and paid for by the civil authorities. The portion of the cost of this machinery that should be debited to the army would be difficult to determine. The revenue grain having been treated as belonging to the civil adminis tration, the only solution which suggests itself as equitable is that the civil authorities should be made responsible for the financial results of the scheme. The total expenditure amounts to Rs. 21,80,588 (£145,372) of which Rs. 18,59,044 (£123,936) was recovered or is under recovery, leaving a loss of Rs. 3,21,543 (£21,436). The balances under’recovery are reported by the Audit Officer to be efficient.11 B 2 (C 1781) The bulk of the loss is due to the remission of certain advances. The price of 679 tons of wheat, all of the more expensive Indian variety was remitted, mainly owing to the failure of the wheat to germinate. The price of 280 tons of barley was also remitted, partly owing to damage from flood and partly to political disturbances. Of cash the comparatively small sum of Rs. 38,936 (£2,596) was remitted, mainly owing to the failure of the Euphrates flood. Of the Rs. 9,000 (£600) spent on “ Vegetable Seeds ” and on Military Gardens,” only the amount actually recovered in cash, Rs. 3,250 (£216), is shown as an asset on the Recovery ” side. Had a detailed account been kept of the transaction in vegetable seeds, a large profit might have been shown under this head. These seeds were issued to military units, who cultivated with their own labour, and produced a large amount of fresh vegetables for the troops, and of green fodder for their horses. There was, however, no staff available to keep accounts to show the financial result of these operations. The Civil Commissioner is not prepared to accept the loss of Rs. 3,21,543 (£21,436) as a charge on civil revenues. The ground on which he objects is that the administration of the scheme originally entrusted to him, was subsequently placed under military direction, and that he cannot be held respon sible for losses on advances which he did not himself control. This contention does not, however, seem to be valid, since the advances were actually made by the political officers under the direction of the first Revenue Officer who was himself working in conjunction with the military authorities. The fact that the great bulk of the cash and seed advanced is being recovered proves* moreover, that advances were not made indiscriminately. It is also relevant to note that the balance of seed advances, when all remissions have been written off, amounts to 5,500 tons, repayment of which has either been made or is expected to be made. If the return on the seed was only in the ratio of 9 : 1 (a low rate) the resulting crop would be 49,500 tons of grain. The share of the administration in the crop on account of revenue grain would be one-fifth or 9,900 tons, the value of which greatly exceeds the loss incurred on advances. In view of these considerations and of the general beneficial results of the scheme referred to in the last paragraph, it seems equitable that the receipts and charges exhibited in Appendix XI should now be transferred to the civil estimates, and that civil revenues should bear the loss which is ultimately estab lished. This loss is estimated at present at Rs. 3,21,543 (£21,436). It may be more. But the adjust ment which I propose is appropriate on this ground also in that the advances were made and are recover able by civil agency, and consequently the civil administration is in the best position to reduce the loss to a minimum. 24. The irrigation works upon which the expenditure detailed in paragraph 15 was undertaken were completed before the demands for labour by the Army had led to a large increase in its cost. The Civil Commissioner as long ago as June, 1917, accepted responsibility for all charges except miscellaneous expenditure, Rs. 1,41,774 (£9, 451), subject to the concurrence of the Government of India being obtained. The accounts of the estimates for which the Civil Commissioner provisionally accepted responsibility were submitted by the audit officer of the civil administration to the Controller of War Accounts. As, however, the detailed report to the Government of India, which was promised, does not seem to have been made, it has not been possible to adjust the expenditure finally, either against the revenues of the Occupied Territories or against the estimates of the Force. This expenditure is considered as in suspense to be adjusted against the civil or military head in accordance with the ultimate decision with regard to incidence. Recently in a memorandum dated the 15th December, 1918, the acting Civil Commis sioner expressed the opinion that the expenditure should, in the first place, be adjusted against military funds, and that it should be left to myself to recommend to the Government what portion should be refunded from civil funds and in what manner. My view is that there is no reason why the full amount expended on the irrigation works, viz., Rs. 14,70,242 (£98,016) should not be debited to the civil administration to the reliefs of army funds. The objections, which the Civil Commissioner entertains to accepting the debit of the whole of the miscel laneous expenditure, are in most respects sound. They are, briefly, that he considers that the civil administration should not bear the whole expenditure on roads and bridges which, though they may be of use to it, were primarily constructed for military purposes, and that he should not be charged for the balance of stores in hand at the end of 1917-18 of the aggregate value of Rs. 26,289 (£1,752). The roads have been constructed cheaply and will need constant attention ; the bridges are comparatively inexpensive structures which will be useful to the civil population. On the whole, it would be a fair arrangement to charge the civil administration for half the cost of the roads and bridges. Obviously a final charge should not be made at the end of the financial year 1917-18 for stores available for use on irrigation projects in the following year. The distribution of the expenditure under the head irrigation in 1918 would thus work out as follows :— Total Expenditure. Debit to Civil Administration. Original— Rs. £ Rs. £ Irrigation works 14,70,242 (98,016) 14,70,242 (98,016) Maintenance and repairs 13,729 (915) 13,729 (915) Miscellaneous— (1) Roads 68,108 (4,540) 34,054 (2,270) (2) Bridges ... 38,328 (2,555) 19,164 (1,277) (3) Water supply to Najaf 7,282 (485) * 7,282 (485) (4) Repairs to streets of Hillah 1,765 (118) 1,765 (118) (5) Material in stock 26,289 (1,752) Nil12 Half the charges for roads and bridges would remain debitable to army funds. As explained above, though they appear in the accounts of the Irrigation Department, they form no part of the expenditure incurred on the agricultural scheme for 1918. The Directorate of Local Resources. 25. It is now time to leave the arrangements made for producing the grain, and to turn to those made for securing what was needed for the use of the army by the Director of Local Resources. The duties of the Director of Local Resources were thus defined in General Routine Order No. 529, dated the 18th August, 1917 :— (1) The utilization of available local resources for the benefit of the Force, and, so far as military exigencies will allow, in the interests of the civil population. (2) Denying local resources of the country to the enemy, and drafting all rules for the working of the Blockade by formations in the field. (3) Preservation, for the use of the civil population, of a sufficient proportion of the local resources of the country to meet their normal requirements, after the needs of the Force had been met. (4) Regulation, as far as possible, of the price to the civil population of the local resources of the country, whether by fixing rates, or by moving foodstuffs to areas in which there is a scarcity. This includes control of such transport as is not taken over by the Force. (5) Drafting the rules for the working of the Blockade by the civil authorities, in so far as it affects local resources. (6) Arrangements for the purchase, collection and despatch of such of the local resources of the country as are required by the military authorities in other countries. 26. It was the duty then of the Director of Local Resources to take over the revenue grain from the civil administration, to purchase bhusa and additional requirements of grain, to transport the grain to where it was to be bagged, and the bhusa to where it was to be baled, and eventually to transport the bagged grain, and the baled bhusa to the place where the Supply Department would take over charge of them. The original estimate of expenditure by the Directorate of Local Resources in connection with the 1918 harvest, other than that on the purchase of grain, was as follows :— A.—Salaries, Rent, Wages, Contingencies Rs. .. 38,75,000 £ ■ (258,333) B.—Buildings, Roads, Light Railways .. .. 12,50,000 (83,333) C.—Machinery, Weighing Machines .. 16,27,000 (108,467) D.—Bags .. 25,00,000 (166,667) E.—Transport .. 45,50,000 (303,333) Total .. .. 138,02,000 (920,133) Of this a sum of Rs. 22,71,833 (£151,455) representing one half of the expenditure on (B) and (C), and one-third of that on (D) was to be debited to the 1919 harvest. The expenditure on the 1918 harvest was thus estimated at Rs. 1,15,30,167 (£768,678). These estimates were regarded as not sufficiently exact, and it was considered that they could be reduced. The Director was instructed to communicate with the Financial Adviser and to work to lower figures. As regards the actual purchase of supplies it was estimated that the surplus of 117,000 tons of grain and 150,000 tons of bhusa, which it was hoped to obtain for the army after meeting the needs of the civil population, would cost, at an average of Rs. 120 (£8) per ton grain, and Rs. 25 (£lf) per ton bhusa, Rs. 1,77,90,000 (£1,186,000) in all. 27. No audited figures of the actual expenditure incurred by the Directorate of Local Resources are at present available, not will they be obtainable for a considerable period. As a result of inquiries which have been made by the Financial Adviser and the Audit Officer, estimated figures have been obtained, which represent a rough maximum of the expenditure actually incurred. This estimate is as follows :— A. —Salaries, &amp;c B. —Buildings C. —Machinery D. —Bags E. —Transport Total Rs. £ .. 8,30,000 (55,333) .. 2,62,000 (17,467) .. 12,00,000 (80,000) .. 11,00,000 (73,333) .. 17,00,000 (113,333) .. 50,92,000 (339,466) The original estimate was of such a general character that it is not worth while to attempt any comparison between it and the actual expenditure so far as it is ascertainable. The Financial Adviser is of opinion that the absence of exact figures should not be considered as entailing a radically defective system of accounts. It would be impossible on field service to require each department to keep an accurate current account of services and supplies rendered to other depart ments within the army, and accounts of this kind are not, in fact, prescribed.28. From figures supplied by the Director of Local Resources it has been ascertained that 56,472 tons of wheat and barley have so far become available for the army in the form of either revenue grain, purchase demand (i.e., barley requisitioned from the farmers at the fixed price of Rs. 100 (£6§) a ton), or purchases in the open market. Three classes of transactions are shown. The amounts received under each class were the following :— — Wheat. Barley. Tons. Tons. Tons. (1) Revenue 36,660 7,122 29,538 (2) Purchase demand 5,648 — 5,648 (3) Purchases in the open market 14,164 2,008 12,156 56,472 9,130 47,342 For revenue grain the cost to the Army is calculated at Rs. 168 (£lli) per ton for wheat and Rs. 107 (£7yk) per ton for barley (paragraph 22). In the case of purchase demand the charge of Rs. 100 (£6§) per ton, is the rate fixed by proclamation for barley in certain districts in the Euphrates area. For the open market purchases the average prices paid have been Rs. 228 (£15^) per ton in the case of wheat and Rs. 88 (£5yf-) per ton in the case of barley. On the above data it appears that the charge to the army for 9,130 tons of wheat will be Rs. 16,54,320 (£110,288), and for 47,342 tons of barley Rs. 47,95,104 (£319,673) or a total sum of Rs. 64,49,424 (£429,961). For the same quantity of grain imported from India the Army would have had to pay Rs. 1,36,85,154 (£912,677) at the rates for wheat and barley (Rs. 270 (£18) and Rs. 237 (£15|-) per ton respectively) prevailing-during the period when import would have had to be effected. If the total of Rs. 50,92,000 (£339,466) mentioned in paragraph 27 is added to the amount paid for grain, there will still be a direct gain to the Army of Rs. 21,43,730 (£142,915) on the local purchase of grain. To this must be added the saving on the local purchase of bhusa. The collection of bhusa for the use of the Army from the 1918 harvest fell far short of the estimate of 150,000 tons. There were two principal reasons why it proved impossible to collect and bale anything like the amount of bhusa hoped for. The Director of Local Resources had not at his disposal sufficient transport to collect more than a small portion of the bhusa available on the ground. Before it is baled, this bulky product needs a great deal of transport to move it. Many of the camels promised to the Directorate had to be employed in Persia. Moreover, the machinery for baling bhusa received and erected was only sufficient to bale 350 tons a week. Some of the presses were placed on peripatetic barges ; others were erected at various centres. We have seen them working at Hillah, Amarah, Kut and Jerboiyah. Further difficulty arose, especially in the Hillah Division, from the shortage of labour avail able to clean and stack the unbaled bhusa due to the activities of the Irrigation Directorate. Eight thousand seven hundred tons of bhusa have been purchased at an average cost of Rs. 10£ (14s.) or, after adding handling and baling charges, of Rs. 30 (£2) per ton. A supply of some 10,000 tons more is said to have been collected in the villages where steps have been taken to protect it against the weather by covering it with tarpaulins until it can be baled. We have ourselves seen places in which it is at present stored in this manner. The cost of procuring this supply is, owing to charges for protecting it and damage done by rain, expected to be about Rs. 50 (£3£) a ton. The cost of importing and landing at Baghdad a ton of bhusa, during the period in which supplies have been purchased locally, is estimated by the Controller of War Accounts to be Rs. 170 (£11^) per ton. If credit for the difference in cost is taken on 8,700 tons already made over to the Army, and on an estimate of half as much again to be handled and baled before the next harvest, there would be a saving to the Army on local purchase of bhusa of Rs. 18,18,000 (£121,200). The criticism might be made that the Army has only received 56,472 tons of grain against an antici pated amount of 117,000, and it will be well to meet it in anticipation. The amount of the revenue demand which the Army was to receive was 50,000 tons. But the actual revenue demand is now stated to be 47,742 tons (some reasons for its being less than was estimated have been given in paragraph 17). Up to the close of December, 1918 about 45,000 tons of this amount had been collected, and the Army had received 13,340 tons less than was anticipated. The balance not handed over to the Army was retained for the use of the civil population in Karbala, Najaf, and other districts. The Directorate of Local Resources has for some time ceased to purchase wheat in the Basrah and Baghdad wilayats, for the reason that it is usually so much mixed with barley that it will not pass the standard prescribed by the medical authorities. Good wheat is obtainable from the Karun, and it will also be obtainable when harvested at Mosul, Erbil and Altun Kupri, where it is of much purer quality than in the Baghdad and Basrah wilayats. The amount of barley purchased by the Directorate of Local Resources fell far short of what had been anticipated. There is no doubt whatever that the farmers held up their grain in the hope that the Army would have to purchase at a high price. The wonderful prospects of the crop now on the ground have defeated their anticipation, and they have now to face the prospect of selling to the army at a much reduced rate. How wise the Department of Local Resources has been in deferring further purchases of barley for the present may be gathered from the following two instances. When I was at Kadhimain r (Kazimain), a town 7 miles from Baghdad, on the 27th January, the Assistant Political Officer told me14 that the wholesale price of barley had gone down in the town in the previous week from Rs. 120 (£8) to Rs. 100 (£6§) a ton. In the country districts it would naturally be at a much lower figure. In the bazaar at Kut on the 14th February the retailers were selling barley at a price which would work out at about Rs. 94 (£6) a ton. They must have been purchasing it wholesale at a much lower figure, and it would indeed appear that at the same time barley could have been purchased at Amarah at between Rs. 60 (£4) and Rs. 70 (£4§) per ton. There is said to be at least 20,000 tons still available for purchase in the Euphrates area, and this can be secured -when prices, as a result in part of the success of the scheme, have fallen to a sufficiently low figure. Agricultural Development in 1919. 29. The efforts to increase local production in 1918 were naturally repeated in 1919, since the considera tions which inspired them in July had gained force by the beginning of 1918. In February, 1918, Mr. Ward, Inspector General of Irrigation in India, and Mr. G. S. Henderson, Imperial Agriculturist, were deputed from India to assist the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief as to methods to be adopted to ensure the fullest development of local resources in Mesopotamia. Their visit coincided with one by Lieut.-General Sir Edward Altham, Quartermaster-General in India, and Sir Thomas Holland, President of the Munitions Board. Messrs. Ward and Henderson were associated with the authorities in Mesopotamia in preparing the estimates for the scheme for encouraging cultivation for the harvest of 1919. On the 15th March, 1918, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief forwarded to the Chief of the General Staff in India an ad interim report by these two gentlemen to enable demands for agricultural equipment urgently required to be formulated before the Quartermaster-General and President of the Munitions Board left Baghdad. Mr. Henderson submitted a further report on agri culture in Mesopotamia to the Quartermaster-General in India on the 15th April, and Mr. Ward one on irrigation on the 14th May. 30. The estimate for 1919 was, after intermediate telegraphic communications, emergingjmt of the consideration by the Commander-in-Chief in India of Messrs. Ward and Henderson’s report of the 14th March, telegraphed on the 22nd April by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief to the Chief of the General Staff, Simla. [Telegram X 8328, dated 22nd April, 1918. (Appendix XI).'] This telegram was drafted by a Committee consisting of the Director of Local Resources, the Director of Irrigation, Mr. Ward, Mr. Henderson and Mr. Garbett. It was stated in the telegram that the estimates were rough estimates only, and that they would be subsequently liable to modification. In some respects they do not appear to have been based on well-ascertained data, but they have not been modified since in any particular. This telegram was communicated-from India to the War Office, which gave its sanction to the recommendations contained in it. [Telegram No. 7373 DQMG, dated \kth May, 1918. (Appendix XII).] The figures embodied in it were accordingly accepted by the Financial Adviser as the figures within which expenditure must be kept. They were as follows :— Rs. £ (1) Irrigation .. 1,30,85,000 (872,333) (2) Advances— (a) Cash at Rs. 5 (6s. 8d.) per acre newly cultivated land 40,00,000 (266,666) (6) Ten thousand tons of seed—cost estimated by the Financial Adviser at 34,50,000 (230,000) (c) Cattle—2,000 pairs at Rs. 150 (£10) a head 6,00,000 (40,000) (d) Pumping sets 200 at Rs. 12,000 (£800) 24,00,000 (160,000) (e) Ploughs, 2,000 30,000 (2,000) It was anticipated that there might be a 10 per cent, loss on the total of the advances [Rs. 1,04,80,000 (£698,666)] or Rs. 10,48,000 (£69,866) and that the balance, except the amount to be recovered for pumps, would be recoverable with the harvest of 1919. The amount to be advanced for pumping sets would, it was expected, be recovered half at the harvest of 1919 and the balance within two years. 31. The sanction of the War Office was given subject to the conditions that the expenditure should be limited to immediate food development, and complete and accurate accounts of operations kept. This second condition will be referred to later (paragraph 82). The first one was imposed with reference to a proposal made by Mr. Henderson in his report of the 15th April, and supported in the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief’s telegram of the 22nd April. This was for the starting of production estates on which cultivation would be carried on directly by Government Agency. The farms suggested were of 2,000 to 3,000 acres in size, and the total area contemplated to start with 20,000 acres. It was hoped to raise for the army on this area 15,000 tons, mainly of wheat, oats and gram (cicer arietinum), the wheat obtain able locally being insufficient, and oats and gram being unobtainable. It was urged, on behalf of the scheme for these farms, that they would help the administration to secure a better ratio of wheat to barley, and would assist sheep breeding. Government ventures of this nature over large areas do not often succeed in the East. The risk of leakage in both receipts and expenditure is great; the alternative of European supervision eats into profits. It was no wonder then that the Government of India did not support the scheme for production farms, and advised the War Office to limit its sanction to expendi ture on immediate food development.reasons why this forecast has not been worked up to. In some districts owing to a lack of cultivators the works designed have been postponed. There has also been great difficulty in obtaining labour— due partly to the fact that a large proportion of the available labour supply was required to harvest the abnormally large crop of 1917-18. In some cases, notably the Hai and Chiart canal projects, the political situation necessitated the curtailment of the original programme. Irrigation on Euphrates Area. 35. The most important works carried out during the year were the following :— (1) The New Mahmudiyah canal. A canal of this name existed before our occupation, but, owing to defects in construction, it was incapable of irrigating with an average winter flood in the Euphrates the area which it was designed to command. Thus in 1918 only 2,700 acres of the spring crops commanded by it matured out of 9,800 acres sown. A new canal has conse quently been constructed, which not only itself commands 40,000 acres of the richest land in Mesopotamia but also ensures an adequate supply of water to the old canal. The latter also commands 20,000 acres from its junction with the new canal. The Mahmudiyah canal is capable of considerable extension, and, owing to the fertility of the land which it com mands, there will probably be no difficulty in obtaining cultivators. An increase of 26,000 acres, spring and autumn crops, is expected in this tract in 1919. (2) Georgiyah canal head regulator. The waterway only of this canal was constructed in 1918, and a head regulator has now been built to replace the temporary heads which took off from the Hillah canal. A second regulator has also been constructed at the head of a branch canal. The canal has also been improved in other respects, and the banks raised and strengthened throughout. (3) Repairs to the Hindiyah barrage. Owing to faulty and defective construction and careless regulation of the barrage a considerable amount of work had to be carried out in repairs, and in remedying the defects which were discovered in the downstream flooring and in the grooves of the gates. (4) The construction of the Sirriyah dam. The dam which existed on the Sakhlawiyah, between the Euphrates and the Tigris was breached by the Turks, in order to impede military opera tions, by flooding the Aqqar Quf (Akkar Kuf) lake and the areas in the neighbourhood of Baghdad. As the Euphrates is some 25 feet higher than the Tigris the former river rushes down this channel during floods with great velocity, and is a constant menace to Baghdad and the entire area surrounding it. The construction of the dam was a work of the most- urgent necessity. (5) A great deal of work has also been done on clearing and extending the branch canals which take off from the Hillah canal. The main work is being done on three branches, but almost all branches have been extended. In this connection the following figures are of interest. Sir William Willcocks estimated that the spring crop on the Hillah canal before the con struction of the barrage amounted to a maximum of 90,000 acres. The actual cultivation on the Hillah canal in the Hillah and Diwaniyah districts in 1918 is estimated to have been 249,000 acres. With the extensions now completed the canal is expected to water 290,000 acres in the spring crop of 1919, and an additional acreage of 51,000 in the harvest to be reaped next autumn. (6) In the Shamiyah district Rs. 1,72,607 (£11,507) were expended on four dams on the Ghumas, which are designed to prevent an excessive amount of water flowing down the Ghumas or eastern branch of the Hindiyah channel of the Euphrates below the bifurcation at Kifl. Had this work not been executed, the levels in the Mishqab, the 'western branch of the Hindiyah which is the main channel of the Euphrates, would have suffered. The main dam controls the head of the branch, while the three others hold up water for irrigation. (7) A considerable amount of work has also been carried out on the Aziziyah (Azizie) canal in the Fallujah district, which has been cleared of silt, the alignment improved and a regulator constructed. It is estimated that the area under crop in 1919 will be 6,500 acres. (8) The area surrounding the town of Karbala was flooded by the Turks to the extent of some 35 square miles. Drainage works were carried out during the year designed to carry off w^ater from some 9,000 acres of this area and a considerable amount of excavation work v T as com pleted by the end of September, when 7,800 acres had been reclaimed. The w r ork w r as stopped owing to the urgent need for despatching the labourers elsewhere. Irrigation on the Tigris Area. The chief work executed on the Tigris has been the construction of a new head reach to the Khalis Canal. The Diyalah river issues from a rocky gorge in the Jabal Hamrin range. The head work of the canal was originally situated below this point. Erosion has been going on for many years, and the offtake of the canal, which runs parallel to the river, has gradually moved some five miles downstream with a consequent loss of command. A new head for the canal has now been constructed above the gorge, and an existing cut through the range of hills at a point where an old Turkish regulator existed has been enlarged to feed the old canal. Ample water has thus been assured at all seasons for the Khalie canal, and also for the small Mansuriyah canal, for which the Turkish work had been constructed. The17 work was begun in June, 1918, and the canal was formally opened on the 10th January, 1919. The old head below the gorge has been finally closed. The new reach has in the course of its length five concrete falls. The head regulator is built entirely of concrete and has six openings, each 10 by 5 feet. The rock excavation entailed was about 30,000 feet in length to a maximum depth of 60 feet. There is a rise in the river at the head of 29 feet between low water level and high flood level. The new canal is capable of commanding an area of 250,000 acres. , Communications. 36. In the Euphrates area, the Directorate of Irrigation has constructed 667 miles of roads with 444 masonry culverts at a cost including maintenance of Rs. 5,35,243 (£35,683). A convenient system of communication has thus been provided for this area. Buildings. A sum of Rs. 3,53,937 (£23,596) has been expended on buildings. Of this Rs. 1,18,000 (£7,866) have been spent on the construction of military buildings, that is, residences required for officers and men of the force, for the personnel of the Directorate of Local Resources, and other military requirements. A sum of Rs. 1,51,937 (£10,129) has been expended on the buildings required for the Irrigation Depart ment, and Rs. 84,000 (£5,600) on those required for the Political Staff. Establishment. 37. Mr. Ward’s figures for Establishment were Direction Executive Total Rs. £ 1,35,000 (9,000) 14,00,000 (93,333) 15,35,000 (102,333) The figures of expenditure, booked to the end of October, from November to March, are :— i Superintendence and direction Executive and estimated on the October figures Rs. £ 2,74,000 (18,267) 11,83,000 (78,866) Total 14,57,000 (97,133) The figure of expenditure includes rations, which were not included in the forecast. Transport. Mr Ward estimated the cost of transport at Es. 2,50,000 (£18,667) It is not possible to form more than a ronoh estimate of the probable expenditure to the end of March, but th.s is not likely to exceed Rs. 3.00.000 (£20,000). The total expenditure for the directorate till the close of the financial year will therefore probably be :— Works Establishment ' • • '' (Includes charges for horses and rations of all kinds) Transport • • ‘. ’Axy: (Mechanical transport for District and Touring Officers only) Total .. Rs. 84.62.000 14.57.000 £ (564,133) (97,133) 3 , 00,000 ( 20 , 000 ) 1,02,19,000 (681,267) Advances. 38. The distribution of seed advances, in connection with the agricultural dev^ 1919, and the management of demonstration farms was made over to the Directorate of A 0 c the duties of which are mentioned in paragraph 33, with effect rom e s u y, • - rease - n ^ The general policy of the Directorate has been to encourage in e\er} p Azizivah production of food and fodder. With this object demonstration arms ave e , tv w p 0 | e area un( ler Kadhimain, Samarrah, Hillah, Baqubah, Khaniqin, Amarah and Nasinyah. cultivation at these farms comes to 1,000 acres ; at each farm p 0 s ave b Punjab wheats (Punjab 11 and Punjab 17), and adjoining plots 'a^nTt ^ varieties of wheat which can be produced in the neighbourhood. as n 17 varieties of Mesopotamian wheat, and 2 varieties of Indian wheat f their varieties of local barley. An attempt is being made m every district to show ^ sirkals (bailiffs) the yields that can be obtained by the use of good seed and proper methods of cultivation. (C 1781)18 The objections to direct cultivation on a large scale as proposed by Mr. Henderson are stated in paragraph 31, but 1,200 acres of Waziriyah, near Baghdad, have been sown with the two pedigree Punjab wheats. The seed produced on this farm, should the experiment prove successful, will be distributed to farmers. There are four main dairy and fodder farms situated at Baghdad, Kut, Amarah and Basrah for the production of milk, butter and cream (principally for hospitals) and fodder. At each place careful milk records are kept after every milking. There are smaller farms at Ramadi and Nasiriyah, with a young stock farm at Ali Gharbi. The area under cultivation on the 31st December, 1918, was 3,600 acres. Fodder and vegetables were produced in Divisional, Brigade and unit gardens in the last six months of 1918 as follows :— Amount in lbs. Value. Rs. £ Fodder 9,478,759 2,34,701 (15,647) Vegetables 880,717 58,240 (3,883) The Board of Agriculture supplied seed, implements, advice and supervision, the unit finding labour. A small experiment has been conducted in the cultivation of ground nuts. All imported seeds are examined by a seed-testing officer at Basrah, with a view to controlling the import of undesirable seed and restricting the chance of introducing harmful diseases and pests. The work of the Directorate connected with dairy and fodder farms and the cultivation of vegetables for the army is mentioned as illustrating how the duties of the Director and his staff have been distributed between the army and the civil administration. The Directorate has since the’ 1st March come under the Civil Commissioner, but the personnel will continue under the military establishment, and on military pay till the end of the financial year (31st March). The Director will still remain in charge of the dairy and grass farms, and the cost of managing them will be borne by the military estimates. 39. A note by the Audit Officer on the accounts of the Agricultural Directorate is appended [Appendix XV], which compares Mr. Ward’s estimate of the agricultural requirements of the 1919 scheme with the revised estimate to the 31st March. Mr. Ward made no estimate for staff and contingencies. The actual expenditure on the staff of the Agricultural Directorate to the end of December has been Rs. 2,68,710 (£17,914), and the estimated expenditure to the close of the financial year is Rs. 4,00,000 (£26,667). Cash advances at Rs. 5 (65. 8d.) per acre of newly cultivated land were estimated at Rs. 40,00,000 (£266,667). The Board of Agriculture have sanctioned up to date an allotment of Rs. 6,00,000 (£40,000) for cash advances, which are being made by political officers. These advances are for cattle, seed and implements, and also for the clearance of canals which do not come within the programme of the Irriga tion Department. Only Rs. 2,08,011 (£13,867) have actually been advanced. The expenditure under this head will thus be far below the estimate. It was intended to distribute 10,000 tons of seed at an estimated cost of Rs. 34,50,000 (£230,000) ; 6,100 tons have been advanced at a cost of Rs. 13,50,000 (£90,000). The advances have been made in ample time, and, in view of the favourable agricultural situation, there is every reason to hope that they will all be recovered. The original intention was to distribute 2,000 pairs of plough cattle, to be charged for at Rs. 300 (£20) the pair. The advances on this account were thus shown at Rs. 6,00,000 (£40,000). The number was subsequently reduced to 900 pairs. Over 700 of these have arrived, and the remainder are on their way. The estimate of Rs. 1,92,600 (£12,840) covers the cost of the whole number ; 165 have been retained by the Director for his demonstration farms and the remainder are being sold to farmers at Rs. 150 (£10) a head, at which rate they command a ready sale. They cost landed at Baghdad Rs. 107 (£7 X \) a head. Between 30 and 40 ha\e been lost. The sale is a cash transaction, and the whole of the estimated expenditure should be recovered. 40. The arrangements for the supply of pumping sets to farmers for the harvest of 1919, the purchase money to take the form of a repayable advance, need to be referred to at some length. A considerable number of pumps in private ownership were repaired in 1918 (paragraph 13), and it was anticipated that farmers would be found ready to purchase others for the harvest of 1919. On the 14th March, 1918, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief telegraphed to the Chief of the General Staff, Delhi, ’in the following terms Ward and Henderson recommend supply of pumps with engines with a minimum in numbers of 100 and maximum of 200. Pumps should be centrifrugal of any size from 6-inch upwards with a lift of 35 feet. They would be resold to cultivators and we should benefit by increased supphes of grain. Ward agrees 50 such pumps could be found in India, and Henderson suggests some are obtainable from Egypt. Piping should be supplied with pumps. Description of suitable pumps follows by post, and I propose with Sir Thomas Holland’s concurrence to send an officer with experience in the use of these pumps to Munitions Board in India.” We were informed by the acting Civil Commissioner that he deprecated, when discussing the matter with Mr. Ward, the idea that m the conditions existing— labour, cement and bricks all being both scarce and dear—it would be advisable to attempt to instal a large number of pumps immediately. ^ ^ c j 1cr P^ottused in the last sentence of the above-quoted telegram were despatched Messrs, arc and Henderson s ad interim report of the 14th March, and a specification for the pumping sets prepared by the Deputy Director of Works (Electrical and Mechanical). [No. Q-2021, dated the loth {arch, 19)18, from General Officer Commanding An-Chief, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, to Chief of the General Staff, Delhi.]19 Id the ad interim report the ouestion of the supply of pumps was thus dealt with :— “ The Administrator of Agriculture indented for 30 semi-Diesel oil engines and pumps to which no reply has been received ; but it is improbable that such machinery can be supplied seeing that India has telegraphed recently that pumps are not available. But Mr. Ward believes that pumps and engines suitable for lift irrigation in Mesopotamia can be collected in India and fitted to form pumping sets, some in time to be erected in this country by July, and others by the 1st October next. It will suffice perhaps if the Munitions Board utilise their agencies in seaport towns, to purchase and make up into sets those machines which are new and on sale ; whilst the chief Engineers and Directors of Agriculture in the different provinces might be utilized to obtain second-hand plant. But it should be made clear that the parts should be assembled at convenient centres, and put into thorough working order, as well as made up into sets, to work on a lift of 35 feet, complete with foot-valves, piping, joints, spare bolts, and tools with which to erect and keep them in repair. Centrifugal pumps from 6-inch diameter and upwards are in use in this country in very large numbers, and if more were avail able would be purchased eagerly by the Arabs, and would do much to relieve the situation. The civil authorities are confident that they could so dispose of 200 sets and probably more. It was decided at the conference this morning to despatch a telegram to the above effect to India. Since then Major Pitkeathly has furnished kindly a detailed specification that is attached. India might be informed by telegraph that this wall follow' by post. “ Mr. Henderson is sure that similar work can be done in Egypt, but an officer, wdio has experience of what is required in this country, would need to be accredited to the Egyptian Government to select what will be serviceable.” sic * * “ Our attention has been drawn both at Basrah and Baghdad and at places en route to the great use that is made of pumps in irrigation ; it is believed that an average pump will irrigate 150 acres of winter and 50 of hot weather crops ; that the former will yield 112 tons of grain worth £1,120, and the latter 150 tons of vegetables worth £1,500, so that a pumping set that costs £750 should produce crops worth £2,620. It is proposed to sell such pumps to the Arabs, but should Government retain a set and employ two men to wmrk it, the working expenses are estimated at £1,000 per annum, leaving a clear profit of £870, in addition to paying off the full cost of the plant.” In the telegram of the 22nd April. 1918, from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, the cost of a pump is taken at Rs. 12,000 (£800), and 200 sets w 7 ere provided for. This is an increase of £50 on the figure, just mentioned. As that figure w T as based on the cost of a 6-inch pump, the minimum size required, while the specification bespoke pumps of larger capacity, an all-round rate of Rs. 12,000 (£800) appears somewhat low. But doubtless it was anticipated that the average cost would be reduced by a propor tion of the pumps on which there w r ould not be any enhancement of cost due to war prices. In pursuance of the intention to send an officer to the Munitions Board in India to obtain pumps, Lieut. Campbell Rogers was selected and left for India early in May. The acting Civil Commissioner informed me that Lieut. Campbell Rogers went after receiving verbal instructions from him, wdiich were supplemented by those contained in the Memorandum from the Revenue Board No. 8029, dated the 28th April, 1918, and the letter No. E.S/547, dated the 7th May, 1918, from the Deputy Director of Works (Electrical and Mechanical). [Appendix XVII and Appendix XVIII.] The 12 pumps referred to in paragraph 3 of the latter letter had been already obtained by the Munitions Board, India, as appears from a telegram of the 24th April. [Wo. 32155, dated the 2ith April, 1918, Erom C.G.S., Simla to G.O.C. in Chief, Baghdad, Appendix XlXi] The instructions given to Lieut. Campbell Rogers gave no directions 'as to cost, but the whole matter had been discussed with him, and he knew the purpose for which the pumps w r ere re quired, and must have been aware of the necessity for their being received and erected at latest by the end of December, 1918, and of the price which the Arabs were likely to pay for pumps. This is confirmed in paragraph 16 of Mr. Ward’s report of the 11th May, where he writes :—“ Lieut. Campbell Rogers, Assistant Political Officer, w r ill represent the Administrator, Agricultural Development Scheme, in respect to the purchase and despatch of pumping sets from India to Mesopotamia, wfill be responsible to him that none are sent that are not saleable ; whilst he will render satisfaction to the Deputy Director of Works that the sets are of a type in accordance with the technical instructions given to him. Lieut. Campbell Rogers was thus responsible to the authorities in Mesopotamia for the suitability of the pumps procured by him both as regards price and type. Had matters rested here the authorities wdio instructed him could have been held responsible if the pumps supplied were unsuitable as regards cost or quality. Under the orders, however, of the Commander-in-Chief in India, of the 27th May, 1918 (paragraph 32), the Board of Agriculture were instructed to address all demands for agricultural implements, &amp;c., to the Secretary Central Transport and Foodstuffs Board. That Board resolved to entrust the purchase of the pumping sets to Mr. Henderson, working as a Controller under the Munitions Board in India. Mr. Henderson obtained the Board’s approval to the employment of some of the agricultural engineers in India, and others selected by him to assist him in the purchase of pumps, as being more suitable for this duty than Lieut. Campbell Rogers. The latter, was, however, instructed to continue to work under Mr. Henderson s orders “ either at port of shipment or elsewhere,” till he left for Mesopotamia, which he did about the beginning of August, reporting at Baghdad on the 25th August. 41. Responsibility for the purchase of pumps thus rested with the Central Transport and Foodstufis Board and Mr. Henderson. The latter had been to Mesopotamia, and was aware of the conditions for which the pumps were required. He had signed the report in which Mr. Ward had calculated that some (C 1781) C 2sets could be erected in Mesopotamia in July, and others by the 1st October, and he knew that they were required for sale to Arab cultivators for the irrigation of the wheat and barley crops sown in the winter of 1918-19. The two essentials, apart from compliance with the specification, were that the pumps should be delivered in time for erection before the end of December, and that they should be procured at a cost which would permit of their being purchased by the cultivators at a reasonable price. The sanction of the War Office to the scheme was limited to immediate food development, and could not be held to extend to the expenditure of advances on pumps which would not be erected in time to ensure the cultiva tion of the spring harvest of 1919. Up to the end of December only two complete pumping sets, out of of the 12 sets referred to in the telegram of the 24th April [Appendix XIX] as having been already secured, had arrived at Basrah, and, in a telegram dated the 20th July (i.e., four months after the original demand), the Central Transport and Foodstuffs Board intimated to the Board of Agriculture that the work of buying pump sets had just commenced, and that it was expected that 30 sets would be shipped shortly. This expectation was not, however, realised as the first pumping set was not advised at Basrah till the 9th November. At a meeting of the Central Transport and Foodstuffs Board held on the 26th September, Mr. Henderson was asked to include in his fortnightly reports prices of all articles purchased. This had not been done up to the 1st February, 1919, the date of the last fortnightly report received from Mr. Henderson. Moreover, the Secretary to the Board of Agriculture telegraphed on the 3rd August to the Central Transport and Foodstuffs Board, asking for invoices to be sent to enable prices to be fixed, and repeated this request on the 2nd November. The first invoice reached the Board of Agriculture on the 28th November. At the meeting of the Board of Agriculture on the 16th November, it was decided to telegraph to India reducing the number of sets to 100. The latest fortnightly report of Mr. Henderson, received before that meeting, was dated the 12th October, and contained the information that 145 sets had been purchased or arranged for. The cable to cancel 100 sets was sent because it was not clear that the purchase of 145 sets had been finally concluded. At the meeting of the Board held on the 14th December, by which time it had become apparent from the 11 invoices received that purchases by Mr. Henderson had not been limited to the figure of Rs. 12,000 (£800), it was resolved (1) that the loss should be borne by India inasmuch as the authorities there had failed to state the prices in time to admit of cancellation ; (2) That, failing India (the two representatives of the Civil Commissioner on the Board dissenting), civil revenues should bear the loss ; (3) That the matter should be referred to me; and (4) That all pumps which had not already left India should be cancelled. Up to the 31st December, 1918, only 14 pumps had been received. The average cost of these pumps, not including freight charges from Bombay to Basrah, and up river or the cost of erection in Mesopotamia, works out at Rs. 17,654 (£1,177) a set. The average costs according to the sizes of pumps are :— Rs. £ 5-inch pumps .. .. .. .. .. 14,478 (965) 6-inch pumps .. .. 16,194 (1,079) 7-inch pumps .. .. 18,654 (1,243) 8-inch pumps .. .. 19,840 (1,322) The great majority of the pumps ordered are second-hand sets, ing sets in Egypt at pre-war rates was :— The approximate cost of new pump- Rs. £ 5-mch pumping sets .. 2,200 (146) 6-inch pumping sets .. 3,000 (200) 8-inch pumping sets .. 4,500 (300) The pre-war prices of Messrs. Blockey Cree &amp; Co., who have sold many pumping sets in Mesopotamia, inclusive of piping and erection, but not including foundation bolts and foundation were :— Turkish Lira. 4- inch * .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 110 5- inch .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 145 6- inch 185 7- inch .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 215 8- inch .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 280 9- inch .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ,. 320 10-inch .. 380 12-inch .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 570 The Director of Agriculture had succeeded in selling two pumps by the end of 1918, viz., one 5-inch pump for Rs. 9,550 (£636), and one 8-inch pump for Rs. 18,000 (£1,200) at a loss on the two transactions of Rs. 4,825 (£322). Local opinion is unanimous that it will not be possible, at all events at any early date, to dispose of the 200 pumps in Mesopotamia, and it is unlikely that any set will be disposed of except at a loss. There must obviously be a serious financial less on the transaction as well as the loss in production due to the fact that none of the pumps ordered were in position in time to assist in the purpose for which they were designed, viz., increasing the irrigable area for the spring harvest of 1919. The Central Transport and Foodstuffs Board, to which under the orders received from the Commander-in-Chief in India the Boardof Agriculture were required to send their indents for agricultural machinery, were dissolved on the 1st January, 1919, and outstanding indents are being dealt with by the Quartermaster-General’s Department at Army Headquarters. A telegram which was sent to India on the 14th January last, to ascertain whether in placing orders for pumps Mr. Henderson fixed any maximum price and date for delivery, and if so, what prices and dates were fixed, and whether masonry testing foundations for pumps had been erected at Bombay on premises of firms supplying pumps and how the cost of these foundations was to be adjusted elicited the following reply “ Orders were not placed for pump sets as units. No firm in Calcutta, Madras or Bombay approached by me was willing to carry out the Mesopotamia specification. Messrs. Greaves Cotton, and Messrs. Duncan Stratton and Agricultural Engineer Bombay agreed to collect pumps and engines from the districts, and along with pumps and engines collected as an urgent war measure by various Government agencies to assemble into sets according to Mesopotamia specification. Prices of all engines and pumps were individually agreed to by me and Deputy Controller Machinery. Engines came from all parts of India and Burma, so no dates could be fixed as owing to congestion of Railway impossible state date of delivery. Masonry foundations were erected beside tanks at Jumna Mills and Apollo Mills, Bombay, and at Agricultural College, Poona. At these places engines and pumps were first overhauled, special suction and delivery piping cast, and worked till test passed, so one uniform charge debited to all sets for testing includes proportion for masonry beds.” The latest fortnightly progress report from Mr. Henderson (dated the 1st February) contains the information that 50 sets have been cancelled. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief has suggested to the Chief of the General Staff in India [Telegram Q/413, dated 2nd January, 1919] that India should bear the loss, as no authority was ever given on his behalf to exceed the average price of Rs. 12,000 (£800) per set. The record of this trans action shows that the original estimate of the cost of pumping sets has been largely departed from. It is clear that, when it was found that pumping sets could not be obtained for Rs. 12,000 (£800) and would cost on an average (judging from the cost of the sets received by the 31st December, 1918) over 50 per cent, more (including freight and charges for erection), the Board of Agriculture should have been at once informed in order that they might have the opportunity of modifying their programme so as to avoid the extra expenditure. There is, so far as the facts connected With this transaction have transpired, no ground for debiting either Army funds or civil revenues in Mesopotamia with the loss resulting from it, and I am emphatically of opinion that no portion of it should be met from Imperial Army funds. 42. Mr. Ward estimated that 2,000 Sind ploughs would be required, at a cost of Rs. 30,000 (£2,000) The estimate was reduced to 600, which have been imported, and proved highly successful. They are being used mainly on the farms, but some have been sold to Arabs who are anxious to purchase them. No priced invoice has been received from India, but it is not thought that their price landed will exceed £1 a piece. 43. The estimated expenditure then on the production of wheat and barley for the harvest of 1919 compares thus with the estimate sanctioned by the War Office. Estimate. Expenditure. Irrigation (including Rs. 10,00,000 (£66,667) for Rs. £ Rs. £ roads and buildings) Advances— 140,85,000 (939,000) 102,19,000 (681,267) (1) Cash 40,00,000 (266,667) • 6,00,000 f40,000) (2) Seed 34,50,000 (230,000) 13,50,000 (90.000) (3) Cattle 6,00,000 (40,000) 1,92,600 (12,840) (4) Pumping sets ... 24,00,000 (160,000) 36,20,000 (241,333) (5) Ploughs 30,000 (2,000) 9,000 (600) * 2,45,65,000 (1,637,667) 1,59,90,600 (1,066,040) 44. By the time that work began on the irrigation projects for the 1919 harvest labour had, owing to the needs of the Army, become very scarce and very dear. Mr. Ward had recommended that ail the works should be completed by the 30th September, 1918. This was found to be impossible. Military labour was employed at a cost much higher than that of civil labour in normal times. This factor is of considerable importance in the assessment of the charges which should be made against the civil administration for these works. The acting Civil Commissioner has urged that he was opposed to the full programme originally contemplated on account of the shortness of the labour supply, and at his suggestion it was, he informed us, reduced by some 50 per cent. He also contended that the haste in carrying out the works, plans not having been subject to the usual close scrutiny by higher authority, has prevented them from reaching the standard that might have been attained in normal conditions.22 Again he considers that money has been expended on temporary experim'ents which might have been utilized more economically. For instance he holds that the £11,000 (paragraph 35) spent on the Ghumas dams would have been better employed had the work been retarded, and the opinions of the Political Officers and Shaikhs taken. In respect of this objection Messrs. Buckley and Roche very strongly hold the opinion that the works could not have been delayed on account of the fact that the levels in the main channel of the Euphrates (the Mishqab branch of the Hindiyah channel) would have suffered. Again we understand Lieut.-Colonel Wilson to be of opinion that the work on the Khalis canal need not have been carried out immediately. Here again Messrs. Buckley and Roche are emphatically of opinion that the work was of an urgent nature, and could not be postponed without a grave risk of injury to the channels fed by the Diyalah. Brigadier-General L. W. Lewis, C.I.E., the Director of Irrigation, before he went on leave early in December, expressed the view that the cost of the irrigation works undertaken for the harvest of 1919 had been from twice to three times what would have been paid at pre-war rates, and that, without going into detail, a fair charge against military funds would be from two-fifths to one-half of the total cost except maintenance which should be entirely a civil charge. Messrs. Buckley and Roche, after an examination of the irrigation works and a con sideration of the conditions under which they were constructed, are of opinion that it would be fair to charge the civil administration half their cost. The suggestion that the civil administration should refund to the army half of the cost was made to Lieut.-Colonel Wilson at a meeting, at which we were all present, and we understood him to agree to it provided that the departmental charge usually made in India when one department constructs works of this nature for another is not made. His hesitation apparently arose from the fear that the charge might be added when these accounts are ultimately audited by the Controller of War Accounts in India. No such charge is shown in the accounts as audited in Mesopotamia in respect of the canals completed in 1917-1918, and there appears to be no reason whatever why it should be added in respect of those executed in 1918-1919. It is then recom mended that the civil administration should refund to army funds half the cost of the irrigation works, constructed for the agricultural development scheme of 1919. To the proposal that the same principle should be adopted in respect of protective works executed by the Irrigation Directorate Lieut.-Colonel Wilson made a further objection that some of the embankments made were of no use from a civil point of view. He cited some of the dams near Baghdad, the Hurriyah escape banks, from near Ctesiphon to Aziziyah, Ali Gharbi and Kut, certain dams near Ramadi, and the embankment on the Euphrates near Musayib. These have all been examined by Messrs. Buckley and Roche with the exception of the last. The embankments near Baghdad were made by the Works Department, and are not included in the charges in the Irrigation Directorate. The dams in the neighbourhood of Ramadi, and from Ctesiphon to Kut are, in their opinion, of use for civil purposes. I have myself seen the Musayib embankment. It appears to be a useful work from the point of view of civil needs, though it is undoubtedly broader than it need have been, its breadth having been determined by the fact that it was at one time contemplated to lay the railway upon it. No charge on account of the work done on it is, however, included in the costs of the Irrigation Department. On the whole it seems that a fair settlement in respect of protective works also would be that the civil department should refund half the cost to army funds. The same arrangement should also be made in respect of the cost of roads and bridges. The expenditure on buildings, which amounts to Rs. 3,53,937 (£23,596) or Rs. 2,35,937 (£15,729), if the cost of military buildings is deducted, cannot be divided in this manner. For of this amount only Rs. 84,000 (£5,600) were expended on buildings occupied by political officers and Rs. 1,51,937 (£10,129) on buildings occupied by irrigation officers. As the greater part of this sum was spent on billets, which will be surrendered when a state of war ceases to exist, it does not seem equitable to debit the civil administration with more than the Rs. 84,000 (£5,600) spent directly on its own needs. The charges for maintenance of canals, embankments and roads, Rs. 2,95,386 (£19,692), and general charges (for direction, superintendence and executive agency) may be considered together. Although the Irriga tion Department came under the Civil Commissioner on the 1st March, the personnel remains on the military establishment and on military pay till the 31st idem. There seems to be good reason for debiting the whole cost to the civil department. The acting Civil Commissioner expressed several objections to this proposal. These establishments have received free rations and, in the case of the lower paid men, clothing which, he .urges, would not have been the case in peace time. This is of course true ; but, on the other hand, all establishments connected with the army which have been working under the Civil Commissioner have been treated m the same way. Again Lieut.-Colonel Wilson is apprehensive that the Government of India may make a charge under the foreign service rules for establishments lent by them to the Irrigation Directorate. This has not been done as yet, and, considering the conditions under which these establishments were working, it would not seem reasonable to demand such a pay ment. Lastly Lieut.-Colonel Wilson expressed his view that in some cases too much staff was being employed, and he specifically cited the staff engaged on the Baqubah side, the Indian element in which in particular he thought to be unnecessary. Messrs. Buckley and Roche do not agree with him : the staff employed is not as numerous as would be employed in similar areas in Egypt or India : in the inception of the work the employment of Indian establishment was unavoidable. In these circumstances the full charge should be recovered from the civil administration. There remains the question of charges for transport supplied to the officers of the Irrigation Directorate. Lieut.-Colonel Wilson’s objection to this charge is that the irrigation officers were supplied with more motor transport than they would be able to obtain in peace time. He suggests that, irrigation being a military establishment, cars have been more readily supplied to it than to the political officers—the proportion which he suggested as possible being 5 to 1. This argument is not really relevant to the question under consideration. It does not appear to ns from our observation that irrigation officers had more cars at their disposal than23 they needed. It is equitable that the civil administration should bear the whole cost of transport used by the Irrigation Directorate. One general consideration, which has a bearing on the distribution of charges for superior establishment, maintenance and transport alike, is that, owing to these irrigation works having been completed under the control of the military authorities, the civil administration will derive benefit from them much earlier than would have been possible had they been left over for con struction in peace time. Labour being, as the Civil Commissioner himself contends, very scarce, it is impossible to conceive that these works would have been brought to completion for a considerable number of years. . -- The share of the estimated expenditure by the Irrigation Directorate to be debited to the Civil Administration in 1918-19 would thus be :— Government canals and embankments Rs. 27,74,847 £ (184.990) Tapu (private) canals 15,539 (1,036) Communications 2,14,798 (14,320) Buildings 84.000 (5,600) Maintenance 2,95,386 (19,692) General charges (Direction, superintendence, and Executive Agency) 14,57,209 (97,147) Transport 3,00,000 (20,000) Rs. 51,41,779 £342,785) This distribution will still leave army funds responsible for a share of the charges in the irrigation accounts which is expected to be Rs. 50,77,221 (£338,482). But of this amount the whole of the cost of roads and bridges (Rs. 2,18,799 (£14,587)) and part of that of protective works and buildings has not really arisen out of the scheme for the development of irrigation and agriculture. Had war conditions continued till the grain produced in the summer harvest became available the army would have reaped the full advantage of the expenditure on irrigation works. Advances. 45. The Civil Commissioner is willing to be responsible for the advances made in cash (Rs. 6,00,000 (£40,000)), on seed (Rs. 13,50,000 (£90,000)), for the supply of cattle (Rs. 1,92,600 (£12,840)) and ploughs (Rs. 9,000 (£600)). The civil administration should then in due course refund these amounts aggregating (Rs. 21,57,600 (£143,440)) to army funds. The Audit Officer has included in this statement Rs. 36,20,000 (£241,333) as the cost, including freight, of the 200 pumping sets ordered. This estimate is based on the average cost of the few sets already received. It is impossible to estimate the loss that will occur on the sale of these pumping sets, or to hazard an opinion as to when they will be disposed of. All that is certain is that the transactions resulting in their purchase in India will ultimately involve a very con siderable, if not a very large loss. The opinion has already (paragraph 41) been expressed that none of this ought to fall on either army funds or the civil administration in Mesopotamia. There is one item of expenditure which, as has already been remarked (paragraph 39), is not included in the estimate. The Directorate of Agriculture—a very necessary part of the scheme for 1919—was not created till some time after the sanction of the War Office had been received to the scheme. The Director and his staff have been employed partly on military, and partly on civil duties connected with the improve ment of cultivation and cattle. The Directorate has now been transferred to the control of the Civil Commissioner. It would seem to be a fair arrangement to charge the cost of the Directorate (the round figure estimate is Rs. 4,00,000 (£26,667)) equally between civil and military. To recapitulate, the total amount then to be refunded by the civil administration to army funds in respect of the scheme for 1919 would be :— Rs. £ (1) Irrigation Directorate .. .. .. .. 51,41,779 (342,785) (2) Agricultural Directorate .. .. .. •• 2,00,000 (13,333) (3) Advances of all kinds .. .. .. •. 21,51,600 (143,440) 74,93,379 (499,558) 46. The estimate of expenditure to be incurred by the Director of Local Resources on the collection of the harvest of 1919 was as follows :— Rs. £ Machinery . • • • • • • • • • • • 8,00,000 (53,333) Hired transport .. .. .. • • • • • • 20,00,000 (133,333) Salaries and labour 40,00,000 (266,667) Baling and bagging 59,00,000 (393,333) The conclusion of the armistice has rendered the immediate reduction of the force in the country feasible, and, though it must be some time before it falls to the strength of the army of occupation, it was found possible to abolish the Directorate of Local Resources on the 1st March. The expenditure estimated above will thus not be incurred. The purchase of grain required for the army will be in future undertaken by the Director of Supply and Transport whom the civil authorities vail assist m making his purchases' The Civil Commissioner has also guaranteed to deliver from Government stocks such additional supplies as may be required in special cases to supplement contract supply. [Extract from24 letter dated the 20£A October, 1918, from Civil Commissioner to D.Q.M.G., and memorandum from Civil Commissioner, dated the 9th December, 1918. Appendix XX.] He has also determined in future to collect Government revenue in cash, except in special cases. This change has been accepted by the military authorities. A very large area has been sown in exceptionally favourable conditions. There is every prospect that a record crop will be reaped and, with the safeguard afforded by the canals which have been constructed and repaired, there should be no difficulty now and in future in providing all the supplies that will be required by the army, after fully meeting the needs of the civil population. Distribution between civil and military funds of expenditure on schemes outside the Agricultural Development Scheme. 47. The question of the allocation of expenditure between military and civil funds on objects, other than the schemes for development of agriculture and irrigation, charged against army funds in Mesopotamia, but which have both a military and a civil value, is in an unsatisfactory position. On the one hand, the orders in the Foreign and Political Department [Foreign and Political Letter No. 24:79/Estt. /B., dated the ?&gt;9th October, 1916] require the Civil Commissioner to obtain the sanction of the Government of India before any charge incurred from Army Funds can be debited to the civil revenues of Mesopotamia, and seem to imply that each case will be dealt with on its own merits. On the other, the principles adopted by the Government of India, in determining the incidence of expenditure which may benefit both the military operations in Mesopotamia and the occupied territory, are thus expressed in Mr. (now Sir Godfrey) Fell’s demi-official letter of the 6th March, 1918, to the India Office. [No. 437 C.W.C. (Camp) dated the 9th March, 1918 (No. 10 in printed papers).] (1) “If the immediate necessity for the measure on which the expenditure is incurred arises primarily from military considerations we have held that the expenditure should in its entirety be charged in the accounts of the military force, though the measure may also benefit the local administration either immediately or ultimately. (2) “ If, on the other hand, the immediate necessity for the measure arises primarily from con siderations connected with the administration of the occupied territory, we have held that the expenditure should in its entirety be charged to the revenues of the occupied territory, even though it may help materially the milita/ry operations, directly or indirectly.” Sir Godfrey Fell contends in this letter that these principles are set out in paragraphs 5 to 8 of the Government of India’s despatch No. 129, dated the 26th May, 1916 [in printed papers], subject to amend ments suggested in their despatch No. 290, dated the 25th November, 1916, and that they were approved in a telegram from the Secretary of State for India, dated the 12th February, 1917. All these papers appear to be printed in File 12 of Vol. Ill of India Office prints issued in May, 1917, but the only one which we have seen is the despatch of the 26th May, 1916. It seems quite impossible to deduce from paragraphs 5 to 8 of that despatch the principles for the determination of the incidence of expenditure likely to be beneficial to both military and civil interests, which are quoted above from Sir Godfrey Fell’s letter. It is Stated in that letter that, in accordance with these principles, all charges of political officers employed in Mesopotamia are debited to the revenues of the occupied territory, and it is sug gested that it is possible to argue that a material portion of the expenditure of the political officers in Mesopotamia, particularly the secret service expenditure, is helping the military. This suggestion seems rather to cut at the root of the principles on which expenditure is said to be distributed, since, although the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief is the ultimate seat of authority, the Civil Commis sioner and his political staff are, so far as I am able to judge, occupied in essentially similar duties to those which have from time to time fallen to civil officers employed in frontier districts in India as, for instance, the civil officers in the districts of Upper Burma after its annexation. In such cases charges on account of civil officers would not be debited to military funds. It is true that, to quote Sir Godfrey Fell’s words, “ it makes no difference to Indian revenues whether the expenditure is charged to civil or military funds,” but the fact that the funds employed are Imperial, does not seem to furnish any valid ground why the War Office should bear the cost of railway construction, port works, river conservancy, road or embankment construction or any other works in so far as they will benefit the civil population of the occupied territory. 48. In November, 1917, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief brought to the notice of the War 'Office [Telegram No. A. 3434 of the \4th November, 1917] that three cases had occurred in which he had agreed, in consultation with the Civil Commissioner, that a portion of the charges should be borne by the revenues of the occupied territory. These works were the Sakhlawiyah Canal Headworks, the improve ment of communications Baghdad West, and certain construction works at Nasiriyah. The division of the charges suggested was :— To be debited to Civil. To be debited to Military. Total. Rs. £ Rs. £ Rs. £ (1) Sakhlawiyah Canal 1,00,000 (6,667) 50,000 (3,333) 1,50,000 (10,000) (2) Baghdad West 43,000 (2,867) 21,500 (1,433) 64,500 (4,300) (3) Nasiriyah works 72,206 (4,814) 2,16,618 (14,441) 2,88,824 (19,255) Total 2,15,206 (14,348) 2,88,118 (19,207) 5,03,324 (33,555)25 The Grovernment of India decided that the whole of the charges on these three works should be borne by army funds. This decision is justified, in paragraph 6 of Sir Godfrey Fell’s letter of the 6th March, 1918, as having been given in accordance with the principles expressed in paragraph 3 of that letter and quoted in full above. The Civil Commissioner had, in recommending the distribution of the charges, definitely informed the Government of India that the works had been carried out entirely (in the case of those undertaken at Nasiriyah) or primarily (in the other two cases) for military reasons, and therefore the Government of India had determined, in accordance with the first of the two principles specified, that army funds should bear the cost. In response to a call from the War Office the Financial Adviser furnished a report. In his letter of the 4th December, 1917, he gave excellent reasons why, on the merits of the cases, the distribution advocated by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief and the Civil Commissioner should be carried into effect, but the Government of India declared themselves unable, so long as the two principles held good, to modify their decision. The works have been visited by Messrs. Buckley and Koche and myself. There is no question whatever of the benefit which the civil population has derived, and is deriving from them. The distribution of the cost which the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief and the Civil Commissioner originally suggested between army funds and the revenues of the occupied territories was, in our judgment, very fair, and, if anything, favourable to the civil administration, and we are of opinion that that distribution should now be carried into effect. 49. Early in 1918 the acting Civil Commissioner, in connection with a case in which the amount at issue was comparatively small, again raised the question of the incidence of cost in cases of expenditure for the benefit of both military and civil interests, and urged that it should be dealt with on broad lines. Lieut.-Colonel Wilson contemplated writing to the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India on the subject, but, after consultation with the Financial Adviser, it was determined that the letter quoted in the Viceroy’s telegram of the 20th April, 1918 [Vo. 103 of printed papers^, to the Secretary of State should be despatched by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief as embodying both his views and those of the Civil Commissioner. The object of the recommendation was to get rid of the necessity for making minor adjustments, and its substance was that the surplus revenues of the occupied territories should be credited annually to the Imperial Government in relief of the military estimates for irrigation. The Government of India informed the Secretary of State that they saw no reason to modify the views expressed in Sir Godfrey Fell’s letter of the 6th March, 1918, or to make any adjustments on the lines of the suggestion made for the credit to Army funds of the surplus revenues of the occupied territory in order to meet irrigation charges embodied in the war accounts. The portion of the surplus revenues to be appropriated towards meeting the expenditure charged to the War Office in the accounts of the Expeditionary Force was, the Government of India said, essentially one for settlement between the War Office and His Majesty’s Treasury. A letter to the War Office dated the 9th May, 1918, conveyed the opinion of the Secretary of State for India that the procedure explained in Sir Godfrey Fell’s letter of the 6th March was appropriate and convenient, and his hope that the War Office would concur in its continuance. It was intimated to the Government of India by the Secretary of State in his telegram of the 7th November last that the War Office would await my report before expressing an opinion. The principles described in Sir Godfrey Fell’s letter of the 6th March, 1918, are in the meantime being followed. The War Office was asked, in India Office letter No. F/4248, dated the 9th May, 1918, to concur in the continuance of this procedure, but did not apparently do so. 50. It is understood that very few references have been made to the Government of India as to the distribution of cost between civil and military funds in individual cases. The question was raised as to whether certain recurring charges of a trivial amount incurred by the Telegraph Department at Bughailah, after troops had been withdrawn from the place, should be debited to the revenues of the occupied terri tory, but the matter was held to be governed by the orders of the Government of India, and was not referred to them. In December, 1917, Sir Percy Cox made three references to the Government of India. Two related to compensation claims arising out of the widening of some streets and a road at Ashar (Basrah). The amounts involved in these two cases were Ks. 12,685 (£846) and Rs. 38,375 (£2,558) respectively. The works were undertaken at the instance of the military authorities, who agreed to defray the cost of construction and upkeep of the roads, on the understanding that incidental compensation was paid from civil revenues. The justification, which Sir Percy Cox advanced for the debit of the former charge against the revenues of the occupied territories, was that “ the new road is a great addition to the amenities of the Ashar Municipal area, and has been of great advantage to the local inhabitants : it was a measure which was in any case needed in the interests of the health of the community, and of the latter charge that “the widening of the roads in question is a necessary measure which could not have been long deferred, and had, in fact, been contemplated by the late Turkish administration : a notable improvement to the Ashar area has been efiected thereby, and the provision of municipal water supply and electric lighting has been facilitated.” The third case related to a step which had to be taken “ as a military measure arising from scarcity of food grains in Baghdad and district,” to encourage the civil population of Baghdad to emigrate to places in the Basrah wilayat where food was more plentiful. At Kut untenanted houses calculated to accommodate some 3,000 or 4,000 refugees were repaired at a cost of Rs 7 000 (£467), and at Basrah temporary huts were constructed by the civil authorities at an estimated cost ofRs’ 2,00,966 (£13,398) to accommodate some 2,000 people. Sir Percy Cox, in view of the fact that repairs at Kut would constitute a valuable improvement of civil property, recommended that one-third of the cost should be borne by civil revenues,, but was not willing to hold them responsible for any portion of the expenditure at Basrah. The decision of the Government of India (dated the 23rd May, 1918) was that the principles embodied in Sir Godfrey Fell’s letter of the 6th March, 1918, had been approved by His Majesty’s Government, and that it was* therefore unnecessary to charge a portion of the expenditure (C 1781) . D26 incurred on any one scheme in the accounts of the military force, and the balance to the revenues of the occupied territory. The expenditure in Ashar was held to have been incurred primarily for reasons connected with the administration of the occupied territory, and therefore to be debitable to its revenues. The ruling in respect of the expenditure in Kut and Basrah was that, if the measure which led to it arose primarily from military considerations, the whole of the expenditure should be charged in the accounts of the military force. The decision on the case at Ashar was perhaps hardly consistent with the first of the principles laid down by the Government of India, and it is not easy to discover why the charges in those two instances should have been wholly debited to civil revenues, while the expenditure in Kut and Basrah should have been wholly debited against army funds. We were informed that, as the result of the orders of the Government of India, the whole of the expenditure both at Kut and Basrah has for the time being been shown in the cash accounts of the civil administration, under whose direction the works have been carried out, and will be, it is understood, finally adjusted against the military •estimates by the Controller of War Accounts. I have been over the huts in Basrah. They are well situated, and the area on which they stand is much less crowded than other areas in Basrah. They have been supplied with water and sanitary needs at the expense of Army funds on the reasonable ground that, m order to protect the military, it was necessary to ensure that the residents had pure water and good sanitary arrangements. The refugees from Bagdad have all left, and most of the huts are now in the occupation of other civil residents. They would be quite suitable for use as model tenements. Considering the nature of the emergency, to meet which the houses were repaired in Kut, and the huts erected in Basrah, and the use to which they are now being put, the charge is one which civil revenues ought to be called upon the bear. The actual cost of erecting the huts was Rs. 3,93,357 (£26,250), and the civil authorities have credited the military funds with Rs. 29,064 (£1,938), on account of recoveries of rent. If this sum is refunded to the civil department and no debit made against Army funds by the Controller of W ar Accounts the transaction will be completed. 51. The general effect of the application of the principles of Sir Godfrey Fell’s letter of the 6th March, 1918, appears to have been to neutralize the previous intention that cases should be decided on their merits. On the other hand it has undoubtedly prevented frequent references regarding comparatively small items of expenditure. Thus a question arose as to the distribution of the cost of repairs to the Musandaq embankment. The repairs were originally undertaken in 1916-17, to prevent the moveable column at Ali Gharbi from being cut off from movement up the right bank of the river. But it had two other purposes in that it was designed (i) to prevent the Tigris from changing its course, and breaking through to the Hai, and (ii) to protect a large area in low-lying country behind the embankment, the crops on which were destroyed by its breaking in 1915. The Financial Adviser thought that the charge should be borne by civil funds, but, in view of the project having been primarily of military interest, and of the sum involved being small (viz., Rs. 8,038) (£536), it was determined not to refer the case to the Government of India. At the same time the effect of the principles which the Government of India have enforced must necessarily be that practically every item of expenditure incurred by the military authorities is debited to Army funds, though the ultimate benefit to the civil administration may be greater than to the Army. On the other hand, it is not easy to conceive that there could be many cases of expenditure debited in the first instance to the civil administration where the benefit to the Army could ever equal, much less exceed, that to the civil population. The principles did not appear to the military authorities to be just, and the fact that the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief was informed by the War Office [Letter No. 121/3/767 (F. la) dated the ‘llth November], that the Army Council were pleased that the matter of the three cases referred to above had been brought to their notice, led them to believe that higher authority shared their opinion. It does not seem likely that in future cases will arise, in which expenditure will be incurred from military funds except on purely military objects. 52. In the telegram from the Viceroy (Army Department) No. 9,122 [82(6)], dated the 20th July, 1917, to the Secretary of State for India occurs the expression, with reference to the demands made on India for money, men and materials, “We cannot help feeling that the drain is not wholly for purposes essential to the war, but includes projects that are really a matter of later peace development,” and, in Mr. Seabrooke’s letter to the War Office, No. 22,226 [82(7)], dated the 3rd July, 1917, it was stated that “ Mr. Chamberlain is strongly impressed by information which has reached him from India as to the rapid growth of expenditure in connection with the Mesopotamia force, with the necessity for a close scrutiny of that portion of the expenditure which has no real bearing on the conduct of the War or the comfort and efficiency of the force.” To the War Office letter No. 121/Finance/l,189 (F.I.a) [82(8)], dated the 13th September, 1917, asking that the nature of the expenditure which was regarded as coming under this definition might be specified, a reply [82(10)], came dated the 29th September, 1917, the office of Secretary of State for India having in the meantime changed hands, that Mr. Secretary Montagu under stood, “ that the information before Mr. Chamberlain regarding the growth of expenditure in Mesopotamia was not of an official nature, but reached him from private sources.” My instructions directed me to report to the Army Council whether, in matters other than the development of irrigation and agriculture, expenditure in Mesopotamia charged ultimately against Imperial Army Funds was being duly confined to such services as were presently necessary for the prosecution of the war. During my visit to Mesopo tamia I have, in accordance with these instructions, endeavoured to ascertain whether the suggestion that during the war, the military authorities have authorised expenditure for purposes not essential for the war, but really a matter of later peace development, and that Army funds have been spent by them on matters which have no real bearing on the conduct of the war, or the comfort and efficiency of the force, has any foundation. Either some of those with me, or I, myself, have visited practically every undertaking, work or building of any importance which has been carried out in Mesopotamia at the cost27 of army funds. We are unanimously and emphatically of opinion that there is no ground for the sugges tion that the expenditure of Army funds has been prompted by the desire to provide for after peace developments, and we consider that they have been uniformly expended with the primary object of securing the efficiency and comfort of the force. That there are a number of instances in which Army funds have been used for undertakings, which will be only temporarily of value to the Army, while they will be of permanent value for the development of the civil government and the resources of Mesopotamia, is a matter of common knowledge, and endeavour will now be made to enumerate the most important of such undertakings, and to suggest the manner in which the civil administration should recoup Army funds for expenditure from which it will itself derive lasting benefit. The Port of Basrah. 53. The port of Basrah is situated 75 miles up the Shatt-al-Arab, from the head of the Persian Gulf. As defined by proclamation the port includes the Shatt-al-Arab, from the bar at Fao to the auxiliary port at Nahr Umar, 17 miles above Basrah. It also includes Abadan, the headquarters of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The bar at Fao limits the draught of ships coming to Basrah to from 18 feet to 20 feet. A depth of water of 10 feet 6 inches is all that can be relied upon at the lowest tide. The question of how to deal with this obstacle to the development of the port demands consideration as soon as peace is declared. There is no reason to assume that the difficulties of dealing with it will prove insurmountable, or that anything need interfere with the development of Basrah as the great port of the Middle East. 54. The port is under the general administration of a Port Director, who receives his orders from the Inspector-General of Communications, and is kept by him in touch with railway and flotilla require ments. The Directorate has been organized so far as is compatible with military requirements on the ines of the Directorate of a modern commercial port. Subordinate to the Director are : (а) The Port Engineer, who constructs and maintains all wharves and wharf machinery, and carries out port surveys. Very complete surveys have been made during 1917 of the river from the outer bar to Gurmat Ali, where the Euphrates joins the Tigris.. Two survey parties were engaged for about six months on this work, and one survey party has since been maintained to keep the survey work up to date. The survey work done so far was clearly for military purposes, (б) The Port Officer, who is in charge of the sea discipline of the port, and controls the pilots (Arabs) who bring ships from the bar to a. point half a mile below Basrah itself, and harbour masters (British) who move ocean ships above the entrance to Basrah. He also controls the pilot brig, which lies off the bar. (c) The officers in charge of the port traffic, who unload all ships into the port badges, or to the wharves of the various receiving departments. For the use of vessels lying in the stream there is deep water accommodation sufficient to provide swinging moorings for 24 vessels of 450 feet length and 25 to 30 feet draught, enough to suffice for the port for many years to come. The arrangements for lighting and buoying the port are good. _ 55. The conditions of the port as it exists at present are in striking contrast to those which obtained during the earlier periods of the history of the expeditionary force in Mesopotamia and indeed until June, 1916. The following description of these conditions is given in the report of the Mesopotamia, Commission :— “ Port of Basra. Up to October, 1914, Basra was a comparatively small commercial port, at which the arrival of two or three steamers was a full weekly allowance. Owing to a bar at Fao, only vessels drawing not more than 18 to 19 feet can reach Basra. It was largely a port of transit for Baghdad and other places up the river, to and from which cargo was con veyed by Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ steamers or by mahailas. The equipment of the port was primitive and barely in keeping with the modest volume of its trade. There were no wharves for ocean steamers, and the merchants’ warehouses were of small dimensions. “ The facilities were, from the first, inadequate to cope with the needs of the Expeditionary Force, and to give reasonably rapid despatch to steamers bringing supplies. As the force grew, and as the line of communications and voyages of the river steamers lengthened, con gestion at the port became greater. Administration of the port, direction of the mooring of shipping, provision of lighters or mahailas, and discharge of cargo overside, were placed in the hands of an officer of the Royal Indian Marine, under the Inspector-General ot Com munications. Reception of cargo ashore was in the hands of various military authorities, who each had their depots, such as Supplies and Transport, Ordnance, Medical, &amp;c. When traffic grew, accommodation for receiving and storing cargo ashore proved more and more inadequate. Most of the land round Basra was subject to flooding at the period of high ri veG but it was not covered deeply, and, if foundations were raised, or the water kept out by earth dykes, stores were free from risk of damage. After struggling with congestion at Basra a decision was ultimately come to late in 1915 to handle a portion of the traffic at Magill, situated about 5 miles above Basra. Here the depth of water permitted ocean steamers to come close in to the bank. By the aid of moored mahailas and planks, improvised landing stages were constructed, across which cargo could be carried from ocean steamers to the stores. At a .ater date—December, 1915—it was decided to construct proper wharves and otherwise improve28 the facilities of the port. These improvements were in progress during the whole of 1916. We have been informed that delays to steamers were at first occasioned, not so much by in ability to get cargo out and placed in lighters or mahailas, as by inability or unwillingness of the military departments ashore to receive it with sufficient rapidity. It is clear that manage ment of the traffic of a port and discharge of cargo was not work to which officers of the Royal Indian Marine had previously been accustomed. They found themselves at Basra with a task on hand of which they had had no experience, with an inadequate and inexperienced staff, shortage of labour, a port where the facilities ashore were of the most meagre description, and where traffic was constantly increasing and congestion becoming greater. We are told that at one time there were 40 steamers waiting to discharge, and that they lay in a line 8 miles long up and down the river. Small wonder that arrangements broke down, despite the willing efforts of the officer in charge. Much of the difficulty could have been avoided, in our opinion, if, from the first, someone accustomed to traffic management of a commercial port, and the handling of cargoes, had been appointed to assist. Men with these qualifications were known to be employed in one or other of the great Indian and Burmese river ports. Their advice was not asked for ; and their assistance was not utilised until more than a year after the landing of the Expedition in Mesopotamia when conditions at Basra had become serious.” 56. These conditions continued until June, 1916, when the construction of wharves was begun on the river front of Magil. The first wharf was completed in 1916, and the second during April 1917. Very great progress has since been effected. A map is appended [Appendix /F.] which will elucidate the following description. At Upper Magil there are now six deep sea wharves with a continuous frontage on the river of 3,000 feet, and two detached deep sea wharves with a frontage of 650 feet. These wharves are built entirely of teak and, owing to the conditions of the river and the absence of boring insects should last for at least thirty years. There are also two other detached deep sea wharves—one for the Royal Engineers Field Park, near Khora creek, and the other for the Inland Water Transport Depot at Magil, but these are lightly built, and designed for only temporary purposes. 57. The following wharves for river craft have also been constructed :— Feet. Inland Water Transport stores depot, Magil .. .. .. .. .. 200 Berth No. 9 .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 350 Berth No. 10 .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 400 Pontoon landing stage between berths Nos. 7 and 8 80 Pontoon landing stage between berths Nos. 9 and 10 80 Two pontoon landing stages on Coal Island .. .. .. .. .. 160 Ordnance Barge wharf between berths No. 10 and 11 130 Total .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 1,400 lineal feet. The first three of the river craft wharves, with a frontage of 950 feet, are constructed of Oregon pine and the remainder of teak. The wharves constructed of Oregon pine will, if proper attention is given to them, have a life of from 5 to 10 years. 58. The following figures show the dead weight tonnage handled at Basrah from the 1st of January to the 31st December, 1918 :— — Tonnage discharged. Tonnage loaded. Tonnage handled. January 131,838 2,903 134,741 February 130,202 1,107 131,309 March 146,006 2,695 148,701 April 135,846 7,764 143,610 May 128,531 5,157 133,688 June ... 125,642 2,606 128,248 July 135,002 1,592 136,594 August 114,082 1,288 115,370 September ... 116,030 2,507 118,537 October 118,135 2,986 121,121 November 98,022 7,225 105,247 December 98,268 4,219 102,487 Total 1,517,173 tons. As illustrating the strain upon the capacity of the port at different periods and the success with which it has been met, the following facts are of interest:— During April, 1918, the daily average of ships in the port, excluding hospital ships, ambulance, transports and tankers, was 19*8 ; the maximum on any day being 26. During March, 1918, the daily average of 4,700 tons of dead weight was discharged ; the maximum on any one day being 6,843 tons.59. The deep sea wharves just described are capable of berthing seven large ships, while two others can be berthed simultaneously at the detached wharves. Two small ocean ships can also be berthed alongside the river craft wharves. Allowing for the time taken in berthing vessels and the relatively inefficient labour supply that will be available in peace conditions, the Port Director calculates that the present equipment is capable of dealing with 3,000 tons a day, or 1,100,000 tons a year. These figures represent dead weight tonnage handled, and mean that 2-| million tons of shipping can be dealt with in the year. Appendix XXI. exhibits the improvement which has been effected in turning ships. Eleven store ships of an average size of 2,022 tons, discharged in June, 1916, had been in port on the average 47 days, during nearly 30 of which they had not been working. The average daily discharge was 117 tons per ship. In 1918 the average number of store ships discharged in a month was 43, the average number of days in port 5 • 35, and the average daily discharge 366 tons per ship. The average days in which the ships were not working was 0-056. The average number of colliers discharging in June, 1916, was two : the average number of days in port 71 • 5, of which no less than 47 were not working days. The average daily discharge of coal was 111'8 tons per ship. The average number of colliers discharged in each month of 1918 was between 13 and 14, the average days in port 6 • 9, the average days when they were not working 0 ■ 033, and the average daily discharge of coal 333 • 9 tons per ship. There are apparently some who are inclined to look with suspicion on the expenditure which has led to these remarkable results. It would be well for those who criticize it to reflect on the amount of money wasted by the detention of ships in the early days of the war which was greater even than in the first months to which Appendix XXI relates. Detention of ships has been reduced to a minimum with an enormous saving of direct expenditure, and an indirect saving of at least equal value. 60. The construction of the port is such that it can be adapted from its present use for military needs to the purpose of trade. It is not in the least likely that its commercial development will be so rapid as to render the facilities now provided inadequate for a long time, but, in any case, there is scope for very considerable extension. The deep sea wharves and also wharf number seven are served by the railway, each berth having an independent siding. This railway lay-out will have to be modified to suit commercial convenience, but the change presents no difficulty and can be effected at small cost. In war conditions consignments of cargoes have been limited to a few departments, such as the Supply and Transport, Ordnance, Royal Engineers Field Park, and the Inland Water Transport. It has been easy to sort out cargoes m the ship’s hold, and to load them on separate trucks. In peace conditions this will be impossible, and transit sheds must be built near the wharves where goods can be stored, sorted and removed by consignees at their leisure. The convenient position for these will be about 50 feet back from the wharves. A very large open space is available behind the railway tracks at the back of the ocean wharves, and, when demobilisation is completed and the Ordnance and Supply and Transport departments have been reduced in size, there will also be a large space available at the back of the river wharves. One chief requirement of a modern port has thus been fully met. There is ample space available for the provision of storage accommodation, which is a very pressing need in Basrah at present, and also for the construction of a customs house and bonded warehouse. Port Equipment. 61. The following electric gantry cranes are either installed at the deep on their way out from England :— sea wharves 1 to 6, or are Electric cranes, 8 tons capacity Electric cranes, 3 tons capacity .. 2 .. 8 Electric cranes, 35 cwt. capacity 5 Total .. 15 Plant for handling and stacking cargo has been ordered from England, and is believed to be on the way out, viz. :— 6 electric capstans. 27 machines of various sorts for stacking and dealing with cargo. 900 feet portable belt conveyor. 5,000 feet portable gravity runways. This plant will be available for handling and stacking cargo in an open space 320 feet wide, and 3,000 feet long, behind the railway tracks to the back of the ocean wharves. The following steam cranes of various capacity are at present in use :— Suitable for cargo from small ships .. .. • • • • • • .. 10 Suitable for cargo from small barges .. .. • • • • • • 6 Slow lift cranes suitable for depot • • • • ^30 There is a depot specially designed for the construction and maintenance of the port generally. It occupies an area of 9|- acres and consists of a store, workshop, saw mill, foundry and pile-making yard, together with housing for the staff and 950 men. A portion is also occupied by the Port Officer as a buoy depot. 62. The acquisition of the river frontage to a depth sufficient to provide for all the future require ments of the port is a matter of the first importance. Sir George Buchanan recommended that all the land on the right bank of the river along the whole harbour front for a depth of 500 yards should be reclaimed. A large amount of reclamation work has been carried out, the land being raised with mud dredged from the bed of the river. It has not been possible to ascertain the cost of this reclamation. No land has yet been paid for, but the expenditure of Rs. 20,00,000 (£133,333) has been sanctioned. This sum will suffice for the acquisition of the entire river front from Gurmat Ali to the creek south of the barge depot, and to a depth of three-quarters to half-a-mile. It is, however, possible that an additional grant maybe required to complete the purchase of Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ property, for which negotiations are proceeding. This is in the centre of the foreshore occupied by the new ocean wharves and the river wharves, and at present forms a dangerous projection into the river which seriously inter feres with the currents. The acquisition of so much as is possible of the river foreshore must prove in the future a most lucrative transaction for the port authority. The value of land in Basrah since our occupation has risen very greatly. A proclamation was issued by the General Officer Commanding-in- Chief on the 25th September, 1918, dealing with land to be acquired for public purposes.- Under this declaration an acquisition committee has been formed ; and the value of land for the purposes of assess ment under the regulation has been defined to be its market value at the time of the occupation of Basrah by His Majesty’s forces, provided that in any transaction duly registered in respect of land subsequent to this date and prior to the date of the regulation, the value of the land will be taken to be its market value at the date of such transaction. It should be possible, in assessing the value of land to be acquired, to obtain credit for the estimated cost of reclamation. The whole of the grant for acquisition of land, should be debited to the civil authorities. • 63. In addition to the acquisition of Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ property, it seems essential, in order to safeguard the future interest of the port, that a depot on the river bank at Suraji, four miles below Basrah, belonging to Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Company, the agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company, should also be acquired. This is at present a temporary wharf which is used by ocean ships, and the company are anxious to construct a private wharf on this site. The wharf is situated just as conveniently to Basrah city as any of the Magil wharves, and a road to it is under construction. As the British India Steam Navigation Company will be the chief steamer company plying to the port, the use of this private wharf, if its construction is permitted, would damage the revenues of the port irretrievably. It will probably be advisable at an early date to consider the acquisition of the land on the left bank of the river, which can at present be acquired at a moderate cost. It is possible that wharves may be required on this bank to deal with traffic from Ahwaz and Shustar. 64. The three chief requisites of a modern commercial port are :— (1) Sufficient deep water accommodation alongside the river front. (2) Abundance of cranes, and ample sheds and warehouses. (3) Railway connections and facilities for transhipment to river steamers. These all exist at Basrah. It has now to be considered what would be reasonable terms for the acquisi tion by the civil administration of the improvements to the port of Basrah effected by the expenditure of army funds. 65. An estimate, which is attached as Appendix XXII, has been made by the Port Engineer, under the direction of the Port Director, Colonel Dockrill, of the cost of the wharves with equipment and of the port construction and conservancy depot. No figures are available of the cost of the original wharves which were constructed. The present estimate has been arrived at by applying a figure per square foot, deduced from the known cost of the wharves recently constructed. It includes all labour and material but not the cost of freight on material imported from Great Britain. The estimate for equipment repre sents in a few cases the actual invoice price ; in others it is based on catalogue prices, without any addition being made for freight. The cost of the 33 machines for handling and stacking cargo and 900 feet portable belt conveyor ordered from England and believed to be on the way is not known, and no estimate can be framed of their cost from price lists. The cost of railway materials in the lay-out behind the wharves is not included. This material was supplied by the Railway Directorate. The following is an abstract of the estimated cost of wharves and equipment:— Rs. £ Deep sea wharves . . • • .. 52,54,000 (350,266) River wharves .. 7,49,440 (49,963) Semaphore station, Fao bar .. 87,500 (5,833) Wharf equipment (cranes) .. 10,74,900 (71,660) Construction depot with plant .. 5,33,000 (35,533) 76,98,840 (513,255)rnmt 31 Certain vessels are in use in the Port Officer’s Department, including the Patrol Vessel “ Alert,” which was handed over by the Admiralty. The other craft comprise a Port buoy vessel, a Port tug, the hulk “ Elphinstone ” used as a hostel for seamen, two steam launches, six motor launches, an anchor boat and a Port fire float. These vessels are valued by the Director of Inland Water Transport at Rs. 4,88,760 (£32,584). The survey vessel “Industry,” a survey steam cutter, a tug and three motor boats have also been allotted to the Port Construction and Conservancy Department by the Director of Inland Water Transport and are value*d by him at Rs. 2,83,500 (£18,900). Details of these vessels * are given in Appendix XXII. There are also in use in the Port 4 Light Buoys, valued at Rs. 22,500 (£1,500), and 34 other buoys valued by the Port Officer at Rs. 16,800 (£1,120). Five “ Aga ” Light Buoys are under order, of which the value is not known. Various miscellaneous items (chains, diving boats, &amp;c.), are estimated at Rs. 22,500 (£1,500). In order to cope with the constantly increasing congestion of the port, it was found iiecessary to provide a further outlet. A site was found at Nahr Umar, 17 miles above Basrah. Here two ocean wharves and pontoons have been constructed, at which six ships can be berthed. The area behind the wharves has been protected from flood, sites for depots have been constructed, and railway sidings introduced connecting the wharves with the Makina-Amarah line. The development of Nahr Umar was discontinued after Major-General Freeland (vide paragraph 63 of his report), had recommended this course. He considered it would still be useful as a reserve (paragraph 64). Two ships can be worked there at wharves, and four others over pontoons. This subsidiary port has proved of great value in facilitating the quick discharge of cargo and turning round of ships ; and the expenditure incurred on it seems to have been fully justified from a military standpoint. It was, however, constructed entirely for military considerations, and is not required by the civil administration. No estimate of its cost is included in this valuation. It may prove suitable in future as a site for the construction of factories by private enterprise. The low-lying island contiguous to the Magil front has also been protected from the river, and reclaimed with earth obtained by dredging. It has been used as a storage place for coal and fuel, and affords exceptional facilities for handling material from ocean vessels to be afterwards loaded to river craft. It is not required by the civil administration, and the cost of reclamation has not been included in the estimate. It may in future afford building sites for a residential quarter. 66. The terms on which the civil administration can take over the port of Basrah and its equipment depend on the decision in respect of its power to levy port dues. Unless the Civil Commissioner is given authority to levy such dues the reimbursement from civil revenues of the estimated cost of the equipment of the port and its approaches would be impossible. The question was referred to the Secretary of State for India in the Civil Commissioner’s telegram of the 21st January last. It can hardly be conceived that port dues will not be levied at a port so admirably equipped as Basrah now is, or that ships will be per mitted to discharge cargoes at any place outside the port. On the understanding that the civil adminis tration will be permitted to levy port dues, the Civil Commissioner is prepared to take over the whole equipment of the port at its estimated cost. This would be a favourable arrangement for the civil ad ministration. The Civil Commissioner proposes that a Port Authority should be established to manage the Port; to take charge, under the advice of the Admiralty, of the dredging of the bar, and to assume responsibility for the maintenance of lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf. We understood that Lieut.- Colonel Wilson intends to propose to the Treasury that the cost price of the port and its equipment should be debited to the civil administration, and that a sinking fund should be established in order to extinguish the liability for principal and interest. The terms of such an arrangement could only be settled after an expert examination of the prospects of the revenue and expenditure of the port, and would involve the primary condition that its management should be in the hands of an authority equipped with the necessary knowledge and experience. At the present stage it is not possible to say more than that the administration of the port of Basrah is perhaps the most important matter to be settled in Mesopotamia ; and that the requirements in peace-time need to be determined by means of a survey by experts possessing shipping and commercial knowledge, and familiar with port administration. It is obvious also that the financial arrangements to ensure the repayment of the capital outlay will need to be elaborated with great care. Since the civil revenues of the country cannot actually provide the capital required it would be advisable that the home authorities, who already stand charged with the expenditure incurred in creating the port, should have some direct measure of control over its management. Inland Water Transport's Dockyard, Workshops and Fleet. 67. The terrible conditions which were caused by the shortage of river transport during the earlier stages of the Mesopotamian Expedition are fresh in the minds of all, and are full detailed in Part IX of the Commission’s Report. The deficiency in equipment was remedied by degrees till the arrangements have become as good as they were bad formerly. On the 7th September, 1916, the Inland Water Trans port assumed control of the whole fleet and repair shops on the river, and shortly afterwards prepared a scheme for the dockyard. Dockyard. This dockyard lies on an artificial island 24 acres in extent between the Ashar and Khandaq Creeks. The excavation of the basin, which is situated at the back of the dockyard, and covers an area of 15 acres, together with its two connecting arms, involved the removal of 286,000 cubic yards of soil. With this material the island was raised to a convenient height above flood level, and an elevated platform at the end of the slipways was constructed to provide for the accommodation of their hauling gear.32 Two large slipways capable of accommodating vessels up to 700 tons dead weight and one smaller slip for vessels up to 200 tons dead weight were built on the river side of the island. Four motor-boat slips, of which two have a capacity of 40 tons, and two of 20 tons dead weight, were constructed on the basin side. The hauling for the slipways is effected by means of a specially designed steam-driven haul ing gear installed at the upper end of the slips. The slips can haul up seven steamers at a time for repairs, four of 225 feet in length, and three of 100 feet. The four motor-boat slipways can accommodate at the same time eight motor-boats averaging 45 feet in length. These arrangements are very efficient, and furnish a vivid contrast to the practice in vogue in the earlier days of the force, when it was necessary to beach a steamer in the mud, and to excavate a hole under it in order to carry out repairs. Substantial timber wharves have been built on the river front, and part of the way up the wide arm of the basin. The machine and other shops lie in the north-west corner of the island. Quarters for officers and men are distributed over the island, and on the other side of the basin. A main road crosses the dockyard from north to south, passing over the narrow arm of the basin by a timber bridge. The entire repair work of the inland fleet is very efficiently performed in this dockyard, and a large quantity of work is also executed for ocean-going steamers. The number of men at present employed is about 4,000. Magil Re-erection Yard. 68. The difficulties first encountered owing to the failure to anticipate the requirements for the erec tion of steamers and barges sent out from England were very great. The Magil re-erection yard was constructed to overcome them. Its function was to provide for the re-erection of vessels built in England, and dismantled in order to be transported. The site was chosen by Brigadier-General Grey’s Commission' Its situation away from the more congested area of frontage near the dockyard affords ample space for the erection of vessels. There is deep water near the bank. It is at the same time protected by an island which assures still water in front of the yard. The total frontage extends over a length of 1,000 yards, with a depth of 300 yards. The surface of the ground was originally only 1 foot 6 inches above flood level, and had to be raised to 2 feet 6 inches, involving about 100,000 cubic yards of earthwork. The yard was begun in September, 1916. It was laid out with eight building berths each accommodating two steamers or barges, thus allowing sixteen craft to be under construction at one and the same time. The launch of the first vessel took place in November, 1916. Between that, date and the 28th February, 1919, 213 river craft and pontoons, with a total tonnage measurement of 26,626 tons, have been put together in the yard, and in addition numerous vessels have been repaired and overhauled. The .yard is provided with a wharf 294 feet long, and contains the general stores for the Inland Water Trans port Department. Work incidental to the winding up of the campaign is in progress ; when finished, the yard will be dismantled. It has served in the fullest degree the purpose for which it was designed. There is also a barge repair depot and a yard for dealing with native timber craft, which lie together on the river bank, being separated by a store and electric generating station common to both. The native timber boat of very light draught known as a bellum has been found to be a very suitable type for con- \ ersion to motor-power with petrol motors. It is in this yard that the conversion is carried out. A number of native craft of a larger type have been purchased during the last four years for special military operations, and also for bridge work to take the place of pontoons. The value of these varies from Us. 500 (£33) to Rs. 12,000 (£800) each. Several of the more expensive kinds were also specially built for the fleet. It should be possible to dispose of all these craft at favourable rates to Arab purchasers. Fleet. r i shows the numbers and types of vessels composing the fleet controlled by the * 1 Tra ^ s P ort - There are in commission 331 steamers (transports), 786 barges, 46 misceflaneous cratt, 416 motor-boats and bellums, and 31 hospital ships ; 865 of these came from India, of which 204 design 11 ^ ^ m Mesopotamia - PracticaP y all the 571 ships which came from England were of special , f oPow ing figures, prepared under the orders of the Director of Inland Water Transport exhibit the estimated cost of the dockyard, re-erection yard, and the fleet respectively :— Dockyard .. Rs. £ 52,34,201 (348,946) Re-erection Yard .. Fleet— Transport steamers Barges .. Miscellaneous craft Motor boats and motor craft Hospital vessels Total Fleet 32,34,255 (215,617) Rs. £ .. 6,09,18,870 (4,061,258) .. 4,52,02,590 (3,013,506) 81,42,390 (542,826) 44,74,290 (298,286) .. 1,93,12,170 (1,287,478) Rs. 13,80,50,310 (£9,203,354) The valuation of the dockyard ana re-erection yard has been made at war rates, no charge having been included for overhead charges or freightage. The valuation of the fleet is based on the actual costof construction in England or in India, or the price paid to firms whose vessels were taken over, plus the cost of transport to Mesopotamia. 71. The acting Civil Commissioner does not wish to take over the dockyard. Lieut.-Colonel Wilson objects to its position, on the ground that it occupies a very costly site and interferes with the residential quarters of the town. He considers that a dockyard should be situated in closer proximity to the com mercial port of Upper Magil. The dockyard as it stands is, doubtless, much in excess of the immediate requirements of the port in peace time. The valuation is, however, extremely reasonable, and it would be a pity to break it up. The wisdom of neglecting the present opportunity of acquisition at this figure appears to be open to question. It seems certain that, if the civil administration does not take the dock yard over, others will be ready to reimburse Army funds by acquiring it. They would then be able to dominate the commercial position on the river, especially if they should at the same time acquire a considerable portion of the river fleet. The objection to the site is not convincing. The present site is centrally and conveniently situated, and seems to involve no interference with the development of a residential quarter. It looks as if a more suitable place for erecting residences would be to the north, at the junction of the Gurmat Ali channel of the Euphrates and the Tigris. Nor does the objection as to the cost of the site appear valid. The actual amount spent on excavation and the formation of the site as it now exists is Rs. 7,88,000 (£52,533) which cannot be considered excessive. The site itself is partly Government land, and partly land the income of which is assigned for religious purposes. The latter cannot under Muhammadan law be sold ; but it is understood that an exchange could easily be effected, with other Crown property. 72. A very large sum of money has been invested in the fleet, the working of which deserves to be regarded as one of our chief successes in Mesopotamia. By the aid of the railway and the fleet it has been possible to secure the health, comfort and efficiency of the troops, who have had to serve during a large part of the year in very trying surroundings. At one time, when the needs of the forward army were greatest, and the conditions of the Tigris most favourable, 2,400 tons of stores were landed daily at Baghdad, 1,500 by railway and 900 by river. The whole amount had to be carried by river from Amarah to Kut. The general health of the force improved continuously during the past three years. The strength per mille of sick and wounded in hospital on the last Saturday of 1916, 1917, and 1918 respectively was 49 '7, 45 • 9 and 36*3. The last figure compares not unfavourably with records at other places in the East during peace time. The statistics in Appendix XXVI regarding the prevalence of beri-beri among the British and scurvy among the Indian troops are particularly interesting. In the last six months of 1916 (the first period for which figures are available), there were 104 cases of beri beri among 57,000 British troops, and 11,445 cases of scurvy in a force of 124,250 Indians. Colonel Willcox, C.B., C.M.G., Consulting Physician of the Force, conducted a close inquiry into the causes of the prevalence of these two diseases. His conclusions were that it was due partly to certain defects in the scale of rations laid down in War Establishments, India, which have long since been remedied,, and partly to the difl&amp;culties of transport and intense heat, which prevented perishable articles of the ration scale from reaching the forward area quickly enough. In a confidential note on rations for the force dated 1st January, 1919, in writing of the conditions existing up to July, 1916, he observed with regard to the supply of rations to British troops, “ the main cause of the deficiency was really due to the absence of sufficient river transport ”; and in connection with the supply of rations to Indian troops, “ i n spite of the improvements of the ration scales, it was not for some months after that the issue of anti-scorbutics could be complied with owing to the inadequacy of transport: hence throughout 1916 the incidence of scurvy among Indian troops remained high.” Very different results are shown in 1917 and 1918. The number of cases of beri-beri recorded among the British portion of the force (86,700) fell in the former year to 84, and in 1918 there were only 51 in a force of 108,400. The falling off in cases of scurvy among the Indian troops was even more remarkable. There were 2,199 cases in 191/ in a force of 236,000, and only 825 cases in 1918 in a force of 307,740. These figures do not by them selves show the whole improvement, for in the past two years the strength of the force was largely in creased by labour corps liable to arrive in Mesopotamia in a state of health predisposing them to scurvy. The improvement in the condition of the force owes much to the organization of the river transport to its present high state of efficiency. . 73. The disposal of this flotilla, which is stated to be the largest of its kind in the world, presents considerable difficulty. . . . . A certain number of steamers will no doubt be returned to the steamer companies in India and to the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company in Burma, and others, such as the towing tugs suitable for the Ganges and Brahmaputra, are likely to fetch the best prices if sold in India. Some steamers, self-propelled barges, and tugs are now under orders for a distant base. But, after allowing or t e isappearance of these vessels, there will be a balance of steamers, barges and other craft, which would appear to be more than will be needed in Mesopotamia, whether the policy determined on be to maintain a large Government marine or a small Government marine supplemented by a consit era e ee m e anc s of private companies. In any case, since it is impossible to despatch vessels to a cutta an after 1st April, and the preparation of steamers for a sea voyage is a matter of time, it is unlikely ha the Inland Water Transport can finish its work until the end of the towing season of next year, i.e. pn , 1920. There should, therefore, be plenty of time in which to determine what policy is to be followed in respect of the retention or disposal of any part of the fleet, and to ensure that such portions of it as will be sold are disposed of to the best advantage. The demand which the acting Civil Commissioner has so far made, is for 2 stern wheelers and 35 motor boats. It seems hard to believe that the needs of the Civil Department in respect of tours which can only be undertaken by river could be efficiently met with such a small establishment, supplemented, as it could be, with motor launches pure ase (C 1781) E34 from the Joint War Committee of the British Red Cross and Order of St. John of Jerusalem. There must also be other civil needs such, for instance, as that of ferrying passengers and goods from the right bank of the Tigris at Baghdad, where the railway from Basrah will end, to the left bank, from which the line to Khaniquin and Mosul will start, that could not be met from such an exiguous supply of vessels. It seems also desirable to retain a number of steamers and barges sufficient to secure the mobility of the army of occupation ; otherwise the rapid movement of troops, which may at any time become necessary in areas which have no railways, will be impossible. The whole line of the Tigris from Basrah to Baghdad will ultimately be without railway communication. Whatever the decision may be as to the disposal of the fleet, it is desirable that the price to be charged for such portions of it as will not be retained for the army of occupation in Mesopotamia or for military purposes elsewhere, should be determined with reference to the original cost of the vessels and the extent to which the hull, machinery, &amp;c., of individual units has depreciated. The settlement of a price, after consideration of these factors, is a matter only capable of final determination by an expert body. No arrangements have been made for the establishment in Mesopotamia of an independent Sale of Surplus Government Property Board. It would be difficult to arrange satisfactorily for the sale of the different parts of this valuable flotilla except through a Board of this kind. Boat Bridges. 74. A number of boat bridges throughout the country have been constructed by the Inland Water Transport Department. Among these is the south bridge at Baghdad, which is a single track bridge carried on steel pontoons, and was completed only a few months ago at an estimated cost of Rs. 8,42,000 (£56,133). The Civil Commissioner states that he does not require this bridge, as he considers the cost excessive and the position unsuitable for the civil population. Had civil needs been considered the bridge would, in his opinion, have been placed north of its present position in the immediate neighbourhood of Bank Street and the business part of Bahgdad on the east bank. The bridge is a very good one; it does not seem possible to do without it, and the Civil Commissioner may perhaps change his mind upon the matter later. The levy of tolls is undesirable if it can be avoided ; but, if the civil adminis tration will not acquire the bridge, the military authorities may be driven to protect their interests by charging a toll to those who use it when not employed on military business. Other bridges are :— Kut bridge Kala Abasayiah .. Kufah Nasiriyah .. Rumaithah Hillah North bridge, Baghdad Amarah Musayib Total Estimated cost. Rs. £ 1,25,932 (8,395) 46,382 (3,092) 44,602 (2,973) 1,34,320 (8,955) 19,000 (1,267) 31,000 (2,067) 1,13,700 (7,580) 3,40,311 (22,687) 70,876 (4,725) .. Rs. 9,26,123 (£61,741) The estimates are based on war rates. It seems reasonable that the charge to the civil administration for the boat bridges should be half the estimated cost at war rates, viz., Rs. 4,63,061 (£30,871). The bridges are all in serviceable condition except that at Musayib, which has been removed temporarily and will have to be replaced. . J 75. The Amarah bridge merits a special description. During my short stay in India I heard it criticised more than once as an extravagant project. This criticism was, I consider, not justified. The town of Amarah is built on the left bank of the Tigris. On the right bank are situated the terminus of the Basrah-Amarah railway, camps for Defence Troops, three General Hospitals, two convalescent depots, a very large supply depot and the Inland Water Transport loading piers. On the left bank are the administrative headquarters, Turkish barracks, many billets and camping grounds containing General Hospitals, the Ordnance Depot and two Infantry Depots of several thousand men. Intercommunication from bank to bank has consequently throughout the military operations been of the first importance. Troops arriving by rail from Basrah must cross this bridge to get on to the marching road to Kut. The evacuation of sick and drawing of supplies have to be provided for. Theie is a large civil traffic of pedestrians and pack animals to Amarah, which is the most considerable town between Basrah and Baghdad and a centre of meeting for the Arab population all round it. Further interruption is caused by the Chahala and Machera canals which take off from the left bank of the Tigris just above the town. Before the war, the only means of crossing the river was by a bridge of boats, upstream from the town, with a subsidiary bridge of boats over the Chahala and Machera. The bridge of boats was both badly situated and in a very poor state of repair. It was constantly broken by steamers driven against it by the force of the stream. Its removal and replacement had become a matter of urgent military necessity. The alternatives were to purchase 12 to 15 local boats at about Rs. 7,000 (£467) to Rs. 8,000 (£533) each, and to reproduce the existing clumsy structure, with all the disadvantages of constant interruption35 (C 1781) E 2 to traffic ; or to erect a pontoon bridge with a mechanical means of opening, and a double roadway, allowing the heavy streams of traffic to work both ways at once. The latter method was adopted, and the results, in our judgment, have amply justified this prevision. A wooden trestle bridge with a double roadway and a pontoon opening has now been constructed. The total length is nearly 700 feet. The pontoon opening consists of 10 pontoons, spaced at 30 feet centres, giving a clear opening of 250 feet. It opens downstream, being closed by a wire cable and winding engine from the right bank. The action is very rapid, the bridge opening in two minutes and closing in four. The fixed portion of the bridge is well protected by a chain carried on dolphins upstream of the bridge. The river traffic through the bridge is from 28 to 38 boats a day, exclusive of native craft. The normal traffic across the bridge is calculated at 110 vehicles, 410 pack animals and 4,200 pedestrians a day. This is swelled by many thousands when troops arrive at railhead. The provision of a less efficient means of opening would have hampered the movement of troops, and led to slower navigation of the river at a time when rapid movement was of prime importance. The cost of the bridge has been as follows :— Rs. £ Bridge with pontoon opening.. .. .. .. .. 2,78,861 (18,591) Buffer protection dolphin chain .. . . .. .. 26,097 (1,740) Engine house .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 9,993 (666) Machinery .. .. .. ..... .. .. 25,360 (1,690) Rs. 3,40,311 (£22,687) The cost is calculated at war rates, but does not include charges for freight. Messrs. Buckley and Roche are of opinion that the general design and workmanship of the bridge are excellent; that it is particularly stable ; and that with due provision for the maintenance of the pontoons it should last many years. They also consider the cost to be extremely moderate. The struc ture of the bridge is better than it need have been had only the requirements of the civil population been considered. At the same time a good bridge at this point is an essential need in peace time, and it will continue to be of use to the troops stationed at Amarah. The civil administration will obtain a good bargain if it pays half the cost of this durable bridge. Railways. 76. The question of the debit to the civil administration of charges connected with the railways to be maintained in Mesopotamia is a very complicated one. The railway lines are :— (1) Standard gauge (4 feet 8| inches): (i) Baghdad to Samarrah (75 miles), constructed by the Baghdad Railway Company; (ii) Samarrah-Tikrit-Baiji extension (58'5 miles); (hi) Baghdad to Fallujah and Dhibban (46'25 miles) on the Euphrates ; (iv) Baghdad to Hillah (59'5 miles), contructed to tap the Euphrates area of cultivation. (2) Metre gauge: (i) Basrah to Nasiriyah (138-75 miles), to be extended to Baghdad via Hillah; (ii) Basrah to Amarah (109 miles) ; (iii) Kut to Baghdad (110 miles) ; (iv) Baghdad to Khani- quin (102 miles), to be extended ; (v) Basrah to Jabal Sinan quarry (23- 5 miles). (3) There is a short line (2 feet 6 inch gauge) from Hillah to Kifl (21 miles), constructed in order to transport grain collected by boats on the Euphrates to the depot of the Directorate of Local Resources at Hillah. Some of the lines constructed for military purposes have no ballast, while others need protection against floods which has not been provided in a permanent form. The alignment of some lines would, had they been designed in the first instance to meet civil needs, have been different from that adopted.. A striking instance of this is the Baghdad-Khaniquin line. Had the line been planned as a commercial concern it would have been laid west of the Diyalah up to Qizil Robat, in view of an easier alignment through the Jabal Hamrin, and also of the extension now sanctioned towards Kifri and Kirkuk, and thence to Erbil and Mosul. Owing to the disposition of the enemy it was necessary to cross the Diyalah at Baqubah, and thence to keep to the left bank of the river. There is, therefore, very good reason why the civil administration should not pay the full cost of the line, particularly for such a work as the new bridge over the Diyalah at Baqubah. Again, the decision that the route from Basrah to Baghdad shall be via Nasiriyah and Hillah does not set at rest all uncertainty as to which of the lines devised for military purposes it may be unnecessary for the civil administration to maintain. The Director of Railways kindly placed at my disposal all the information in his possession. Plant and machinery form the greater part of the value of the railways. The condition of the locomotives and rolling stock supplied from the different railway systems in India varies very greatly, and up to date the terms on which they are to be taken over by the Army do not appear to have been settled by the Railway Board in India. Nor are figures available to show the charges for material supplied by the War Office. The types are numerous : no less than 70 of metre gauge waggons, and 21 of metre gauge locomotives. There is no doubt, speaking generally, that the expenditure incurred during the war far exceeds any sum at which the railways could fairly be assessed as a commercial concern. The Army has been using the rolling stock on an average for two years under conditions which made its upkeep to a commercial standard impossible. The different considerations, however, which would have to be weighed before the terms of a settlement of railway36 charges as between Army funds and the civil administration could be proposed, could only be satisfactorily investigated by a railway expert. I therefore welcomed the news conveyed in the War Office telegram of the 26th December last that Major Tew, R.E., was about to arrive in Mesopotamia to carry out a similar examination to that already undertaken by him in Egypt and East Africa, into the financial arrangements affecting the Mesopotamian railways, and was hoping to make over to him such information as I had been able to collect. The news received by the later telegram of the 6th February that he is not coming after all, was disappointing. The subject is quite beyond my power to deal with, and all I can suggest is that either Major Tew, or, if his services will not be available, some one with similar qualifications, should be deputed to report both on the general question of the terms on which the railways should be handed over to the civil administration, and also on the points enumerated in the telegram of instructions to Major Tew of the 26th December, 1918. Telegraphs, Telephones, and Posts. 77. The Director of Telegraphs has supplied an estimate of the value of the Telegraph and Telephone systems in Mesopotamia, which is available for transfer to the civil administration [Appendix XXVIII], of which the following is an abstract :— Telegraph lines Rs. .. 20,68,200 £ (137,880) Telegraph office equipment 1,44,910 (9,660) Telephone systems .. 8,53,380 (56,892) Unissued stock in depots .. 4,27,730 (28,515) Buildings .. 95,800 (6,387) Rs. 35,90,020 (£239,334) Credit has been taken in the account for certain material which had belonged to the Turks. It seems right that the civil administration should receive this material free, but should pay any expenses incurred in reconstructing, re-erecting or repairing it. The following deductions should therefore be made :— Rs. £ 1. Turkish material captured and re-erected 1,32,500 (8,833) 2. Existing lines in Mosul and Sulaimaniyah areas 2,11,700 (14,113) These deductions will reduce the estimated value of the Telegraph lines and Telephones to Rs. 32,45,820 (£216,388). No charges have been made for the cost of Technical, Supervising, and Adminis trative Establishments employed, or for freights from India to Basrah. A charge of Rs. 55 (£3§) per ton has been made for river freightage from Basrah to Baghdad. These were the war rates charged by Messrs. Lynch Brothers. The valuation of material is at pre-war rates. Credit has not been taken for the Basrah-Kuwait Line, or for the Basrah-Amarah Trunk Telephone system. The former was con structed to meet the requirements of the Government of India, and its cost (Rs. 55,593 (£3,573)) has been debited to Indian Revenues. The latter is not required by the civil administration, and it will in due course be dismantled, and the material disposed of in India. The civil administration should, I consider, be charged for the whole cost of material and equipment which it may take over as estimated in this valuation, less the deductions suggested, and one half the cost of buildings, i.e., Rs. 47,900 (£3,193). It is understood that any portion of the material which the administration does not desire to acquire will be re-purchased for India, where it is much needed. The Director of Postal Services has furnished a statement which estimates the present value of furniture and fittings in the possession of the Postal Service at Rs. 24,000 (£1,600). No account was, he says, kept of articles supplied from India, or from Mesopotamia. The Field Controller of Military Supply Accounts, Basrah, also informs me that no record was kept or book adjustment made for issues to the Postal Department. These figures are, therefore, all that are available. It would in the circumstances be reasonable to charge the civil administration Rs. 24,000 (£1,600) for the furniture and fittings. Water Supply. 78. (i) Baghdad. At the date of British occupation Baghdad was supplied with water from two pumping stations, to which a third was subsequently added by the military authorities. There were two independent pipe systems, capable of intercommunication. All the pumping stations were within the limits of the city and subject to pollution. On the 6th December, 1917, it was decided to erect a new pumping station upstream from the city. The work has now been completed at a cost, including settling tanks, of Rs. 3,11,081 (£20,739). The new line is connected with the old pipe system, and the water is distributed as before. The total capacity of the pumps is 1,440,000 gallons a day, which gives approxi mately an allowance of 12 gallons per head per day to the population. All the plant employed was collected in Mesopotamia. No invoices were received for any portion of the installation, and the value is estimated at war rates. The installation is not of sufficient capacity to provide the whole of Baghdad at the same time, and, owing to lack of reserve power, the pumps cannot be worked continuously. The suppiy is insufficient for a modern system of sanitation. The installation is now new ; and fewer but larger pumps would probably be more efficient and economical. The pipe fine is also not entirely satis factory. The 14-inch diameter pipe originally proposed could not be obtained, and two parallel pipes 8 inches in diameter were substituted, the capacity of which is half that of the original pipe. In view of these facts, I think it would be right to charge the civil administration one-fourth of the cost, or Rs. 78,000 (£5,200). The Civil Commissioner is willing to take over the installation at these rates.(ii) Basrah. —The present system of water supply has been constructed at various periods. It con sists of a number of small pumping stations which are expensive to maintain, and require a large statt. It was constructed to meet military needs only, and cannot be satisfactorily converted into a permanent system. This would require one large pumping station, and an entirely different arrangement ot mains. It would be costly and would take a considerable time to complete. . . The mains supplying the water are almost all wrought iron pipes, and therefore unsuitable tor a permanent system. The Deputy Director of Works (Electrical and Mechanical) has supplied the follow- Cost. Depreciation. — Basrah and Ashar ... Magil ...

Electrical and Mechanical Installation. 79. (1) Basrah.— The most important electrical and mechanical works at Basrah are situated on the Ashar creek. These consist of the following .— (a) A Central Power Station of 1,700 k.w. capacity with a complete distribution ^em. ((,) A Central Ice Plant, which can supply 22 tons daily, with a 250-ton ice store attached. (c) Central workshops. (d) Temporary quarters for staff. , , , . rr . All these plants are largely interdependent and should be taken over as one undertaking. e Power Station is of sufficient capacity to meet TheToter“n Ind as follows :— Central Power Station..

(6) A Central Ice Plant with a 150-ton ice store attached. (c) A Central Workshop.38 These plants are also interdependent, and should be taken over together. The Power Station is sufficient for the needs of Baghdad, and can probably be worked on commercial lines so as to yield revenue almost at once. The present value of these works as given by the Deputy Director of Works (Electrical and Mechanical) is :— Rs. £ Central Power Station 7,36,260 (49,084) Central Ice Plant 1,63,425 (10,895) Workshops 1,83,780 (12,252) Total Rs. 10,83,465 (£72,231) The plant is accommodated to a great extent in an old Turkish building, and only the actual expendi ture incurred in rendering the building suitable has been included in this valuation. The charge to the civil administration should be the amount of the valuation. (3) Smaller Installations .—There are smaller electrical installations at Amarah valued at Rs. 1,39,725 (£9,285) ; at Qurna, valued at Rs. 24,000 (£1,600); and at Nasiriyah, valued at Rs. 78,000 (£5,200). If required by the civil administration this plant should be taken over at this valuation.’ The conditions suggested in respect of the transfer of waterworks apply also to the transfer of electrical installations. Ice and refrigerating installations have been put up for military purposes in various stations. These are not required by the Civil Commissioner and can be disposed of. A certain amount of surplus electrical and mechanical store is in stock, which will be available, if required, for the maintenance of the civil electrical and mechanical works. This is valued at Rs. 6,00,000 (£40,000). Some miscellaneous small plant which may be useful for civil requirements will also become available as demobilization proceeds. The estimated value of this is Rs. 2,25,000 (£15,000). The approximate value of electrical installations of lights and fans in hospitals, billets, &amp;c., amounts to Rs. 27,00,000 (£180,000). Such of these as have to be dismantled can be disposed of to the civil authorities at their recorded values, or, if not required locally, sold back in India, where, it is understood, there is a great demand for them. Miscellaneous. • 80. (1) Tigns Roads. I do not advise that any charge should be made to the civil administration for the greater portion of the roads constructed by the Department of Works in the Tigris area. They are for the most part of a temporary nature and not provided with culverts. The road from Baghdad to Basrah has, however, been bridged throughout, and will continue to be an essential trunk communication for the civil administration. The length is 334 miles, of which 18 miles are constructed on embankment. The cost including bridges is estimated at Rs 2 68 600 (£17 906) !t would be fair to debit 50 per cent, of this, or Rs. 1,34,300 (£8,953), to the civil administration. ’ Ihe Department of Works also constructed the roads and bridges in the Nasiriyah division on the ' , T ie . cost of t ^ le Sanaawah-Nasiriyah road with bridges is estimated at Rs. 41 250 (£2,750), and ot other bridged roads in the Tigris area, including Nasiriyah town, at Rs. 9 710 (£647). Fifty per cent, of this expenditure also should be debited to the civil administration. (2) Basrah Roads.—In Basrah a considerable amount of road-making was essential to make communications possible It is difficult to realize without actual experience the conditions which prevail after rainfall. The problem was aggravated by the entire absence of road metal. The most suitable site for camps was found to be at Makina, to the north of Basrah. The deep sea wharves at Maffil are two miles beyond Makma. In 1917 all motor traffic was suspended for long periods between^these centres and it was to meet this difficulty that a concrete road 4^ miles in length was constructed. \Mav Appendix III.] The construction of a road of this description was no doubt fully justified by the pressing emergency. But this material would not have been used in ordinary conditions, and in the circumstances it woula be fair to limit the charge against the civil administration to what would be reasonable in the case of the ordinary metalled road. Of these 7f miles have been constructed, and various composite wooden and steel bridges have been made over the Ashar and other creeks F The estimated cost of the bridges amounts to Rs. 53,248 (£3,549), and that of the metalled roads including the concrete road, at an all round rate of Rs. 15 (£1) a yard, to Rs. 3,22 230 (£21 482) I administration^ ^ ^ ° f ^ ^ 01 Rs ' 1 ’ 87 ’ 739 ( £12 ’ 515 )&gt; should be debited to the civil , T Jl e and S}ia ibah Bunds.—The Zubair embankment was constructed in 1916 from the bank of the Tigris westward across a depression which was at one time the bed of the Euphrates a distance of some five or six miles to the high land of the desert. The Shaibah is a smaller embankment constructed for the protection of the Makina base. It has been determined that the constructioTof und^VconsTwion The U ^ erta + ken P n “ aril y for military reasons; but, when the estimates were under consideration, the authorities m Mesopotamia were of opinion that Rs. 75,000 (£5 000) might (f^OOO^shouffi 0 be' recove tk V eVeilUeS of t} ! e occ opied territory. It was considered that’Rs 30,000 floods iffo h rded d bv h ^ P'°P erties had benefited from the protection against floods afforded by the embankments ; and that Rs. 40,000 (£2667) should be contributed from the revenues of the occupied territory on account of the raised road to Zubair provided by the embankment e original estimate of the cost of the two embankments was Rs. 5,75,650 (£38 377) • but this was eventually increased to Rs^ 10 64,114 (£70,941). The levels originally taken were found to be erroneous while the flood level was higher than anticipated. The Government of India, however, in their ArmyDepartment Despatch No. 93, dated the 10th November, 1916 (quoted in Sir Godfrey Fell’s letter of the 6th March, 1918), recommended that the entire expenditure connected with the Zubair Bund should be charged in the accounts of the Expeditionary Force. I have not seen this despatch, and am not, therefore, aware of the reasons which led to the recommendations of the local authorities being overruled. In view of the great and permanent protection from floods afforded by these embankments to local property owners, the proposal to levy some contribution from civil revenues appears to be completely justified. The sum proposed was very small, and the cost having been greater than was estimated, it seems reasonable that it should be raised in proportion to the increase in the estimate. I would, there fore, recommend that Ks. 1,38,430 (£9,243) should be recovered from Civil Revenues towards the construction of these embankments. (4) Decauville Light Railway. —-Twenty-three miles of 2-foot gauge light railway have been laid to facilitate transport and material from Basrah to the camps at Makina and the depots and wharves at Magil, as well as to bring in earth from the desert, for reclamation purposes and construction of roa,ds. The line was laid down to meet military requirements. It would be necessary to re-align it to serve suitable civil areas such as Basrah city. The stock consist of 25 steam locomotives, of which 19 are in good order, 6 motor tractors and a considerable amount of other rolling stock. The material is valued at Rs. 6,33,000 (£42,200), not including 39 bogie trucks, the value of which is not known. This stock also should be valued by the railway expert. The Civil Commissioner states that he does not require the railway which should, he suggests, be put up for sale to a syndicate of local merchants. (5) Engineer Field Park Workshops .—The buildings and machinery of the Engineer Field Park are valued at pre-war rates by the Director of Works as follows :— The Civil Commissioner wishes to take over these buildings and machinery, which should be charged for at these rates. (6) Permanent Buildings .—There are certain permanent buildings at Basrah which have been erected by the Works Department. These are :— (1) The hotel erected for the use of officers. The actual cost of this hotel, including furniture and electrical fittings, is stated by the Deputy Director of Works to be Rs. 1,52,300 (£10,147). This includes no charge for supervision. The Civil Commissioner is willing to take over the hotel at a fair price, and it is understood that he proposes to put it to a public use. On this under standing I consider that, when available, it should be made over to him at this figure. Should he, however, not wish to acquire it at the price there should be no difficulty in disposing of it in the open market, probably at a higher figure. (2) Ordnance warrant officers and non-commissioned officers’ quarters. The actual cost of these quarters, including electrical and water fittings, is stated by the Deputy Director to be Rs. 2,52,000 (£16,800). He considers that Rs. 1,50,000 (£10,000) would be a fair price for the building. It is not so conveniently situated as the hotel, and I agree that it should be transferred to the civil authorities, if required by them, for this sum. In this case also, and indeed in all cases of the kind, it should be distinctly understood that the properties will only be transferred at the favourable rates proposed when they are re quired for some public purpose of the civil administration, and that the civil authorities will have no option of re-sale to the public. (7) Steel Shedding .—There is at the Base a large amount of steel shedding valued roughly by the Deputy Director of Works at Rs. 18,38,000 (£122,533). The Civil Commissioner is prepared to take over all steel shedding on condition that he may sell such portion as he does not require to the pubhc. This condition should not, I think, be allowed : if the whole or any part of the stock is required by him tor pubhc purposes it should be charged for at the valuation fixed by the Director. (8) Fire Station, Basrah .—There are two fire stations at Basrah, the headquarters of which are at Ashar and Magil. The Magil station includes a fire float station, and there are also two fire float stations down the river. The estimated present value of the engines and appliances in use at the Ashar central station is Rs. 71,700 (£4,780) ; the value of the appliances used at the port and amongst shipping is Rs. 69 900 (£4,660). The Civil Commissioner has stated that he does not require the land appliances. When no longer wanted by the Army, they should be saleable in India. Any of the plant retained for the use of the port and amongst shipping should be charged in accordance with this valuation. (9) Baghdad Roads, Inland Water Transport Repairing Yard and Fire Station. I do not propose that any charge should be made to the civil authorities for roads in Baghdad. The work done has been almost entirely maintenance. Such roads as have been constructed are purely military roads for the use of the advanced base, and cannot fairly be charged to Civil Revenues. There is a small Inland Water Transport Repairing Yard, which the Civil Commissioner states he does not reqmre. 1 here is a Wt-a Station nrovided with one 60-horse-power motor fire engine, and three other Buildings Machinery Rs. £ 99,000 (6,600) 1.46,251 (9,750) Rs. 2,45,251 (£16,330) India.For reasons given in paragraphs 73 and 76 respectively the summary does not include any suggestions for recoveries to be made for steamers and other craft of the Inland Water Transport fleet which may be purchased by the civil authorities, or for the railway systems in Mesopotamia. I am directed to report how civil funds can currently or eventually bear such charges. I have been informed by the acting Civil Commissioner that no budget has yet been prepared of the revenue and expenditure of the occupied territory for the current year. The net receipts for 1915-16 were £130,000 : for 1916-17 £270,000, and for 1917-18 £100,000, according to the telegram from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India of the 5th February 1918. It is evident from these figures that the civil administration is not likely, at an early date, to be able to pay the bill set out above. In his letter No. 18791 of the 8th September last to the Chief of the General Staff at Baghdad, Lieut.-Colonel Wilson wrote, I am assuming that, in the case of railways, works, power plant and other assets of the kind erected in the country and required for post-war purposes, they will be assessed and handed over at a valuation to the civil adminis tration, which will hand over to the Treasury an equivalent of Mesopotamian Bonds in lieu thereof, the interest and sinking fund on w^hich will be payable annually. An arrangement of this nature seems to be the only one to meet the case ; details of it will depend on the status which the Peace Conference may assign to Mesopotamia in the future.” Financial Control over Agricultural and Irrigation Schemes. 82. I am directed to make recommendations to secure, as far as possible, that adequate local business- control and supervision are maintained on behalf of the Imperial Government over expenditure on the schemes for Irrigation and Agriculture. The Financial Adviser, who had to deal with this expenditure, was an officer of the Military Accounts Department, and it is not an easy matter for any financial authority, who has not had administrative or revenue experience among Eastern peoples, to give an opinion on projects for the extension of irrigation and the encouragement of cultivation such as were embodied in the schemes for 1918 and 1919. The Agricultural Development Scheme prepared by Mr. Garbett in 1918 was not preceded by any elaborate financial examination of details. Indeed, since it was only drawn up in July, 1917, and since sowings for the Spring harvest of 1918 were timed to begin on 15th September, it is patent that if the results aimed at were to be achieved, no laborious examination of these details could be attempted, the success of the scheme depending on immediate arrangements being made to procure the necessary seed, to put in hand the cleaning of the canals to be utilized, and to arrange for advances to cultivators. The original scheme contemplated an expenditure of £300,000 to be treated as recoverable advances, and the only out-of-pocket expenses involved in it were such proportions of the advances as might prove to be irrecoverable, and the salaries of the very small staff specially engaged for the scheme. As has been stated in paragraphs, the committee which examined the scheme added to the estimated expenditure the sum of £100,000 for miscellaneous expenses. The figures stated above were then regarded by the Financial Adviser as a Budget which could not be exceeded without further sanction. No returns of expenditure seem to have been submitted to the Financial Adviser. The expenditure had been authorized, and, as the sanctioned estimates were not exceeded, no further financial control was exercised over the Administrator’s expenditure. The scheme eventuated, as has already been stated, m a loss of 4:30 It’has been noticed (paragraph 30) that the estimates of 1919 seem to have been m some respects based on imperfectly ascertained data. The estimates finally sent in on the 22nd April were described as being rough estimates, subject to further modification as occasion might arise. The figures have not been modified, and have been regarded by the Financial Adviser as definite figures sanctioned by the War Office. , , „ • , • i ^ n j • In order to secure that the accounts of the scheme, should be fully maintained, the Lommander-m- Ohief in India, in the Quartermaster General’s letter of the 27th May, 1918 [AppendixXIII], insisted that the Financial Adviser should keep in constant touch with the progress of operations, his primary object beino' to assist in securing that expenditure should be limited to immediate food development. It was ordered that a member of the Financial Adviser’s staff should be placed at the disposal of the Board of Agriculture for the purpose of keeping a financial record. Complete and accurate accounts °f a fi opera-- tions were to be submitted in the first instance by the disbursing and receiving officers to this special; Accounts Officer. His duty was to compile these accounts in an approved form for the field Controller, of Military Supply Accounts. The Financial Adviser was himself directed to submit a quarterly review of expenditure connected with the scheme. For the purpose of this review special forms of accounts exhibiting under the accepted heads of charge the expenditure of the Directors of Agriculture and Irrigation were prepared by the Financial Adviser, and approved by the Board of Agriculture and the Government of India. In the case of the Director of Irrigation a complete schedule of expenditure on (l) Government canals, (2) Tapu (private) canals, (3) Protective works, (4) Communications, (5) Build ings, (6) Miscellaneous petty repairs or construction, (7) General, including executive, superintendence- and direction charges, was prescribed. v . , x The account required in the case of the Director of Agriculture was limited to the expenditure on Dairv Farms, Grass and Fodder Farms, Demonstration Farms, Establishment, Directorate, Office Contingencies’ and Transport, these being the heads of charge under the immediate control of the Director ° f ^fhlTfinancial results in both the Irrigation and Agricultural branches of the scheme for 1919 are alike in that the present estimate of expenditure falls below the original estimate under almost every separate head. (C 1781) FIn actual practice, the accounts submitted by the Special Accounts Officer to the Field Controller of Military Supply Accounts were in the usual form in which expenditure in the field is recorded for incorporation in the Field Classified Abstract prepared monthly by the Field Controller of Military Supply Accounts for transmission to India. The first of these accounts was submitted on the 28th July, 1918, in respect of the Irrigation Directorate, and on the 6th January, 1919, in respect of the Agricultural Directorate. The Special Accounts Officer, for lack of staff, was unable to submit compiled accounts at an earlier date. The first monthly returns of the expenditure of the Agriculture and Irrigation Directorates, prepared in the special form mentioned above, were completed by the Special Accounts Officer on the 10th December, 1918, and these recorded expenditure up to the 30th September, 1918. The forms had been finally approved in August. The Financial Adviser had consequently not been in a position to prepare a quarterly review before my arrival at Baghdad, and the first review and summary of accounts were drawn up for the purpose of my inquiry. The return relating to the Directorate of Agriculture, which the Special Accounts Officer prepared, does not, for certain reasons, extend to a return of the monthly expenditure under certain important heads affecting the Agricultural Development Scheme. In the first place it was found that the Board of Agriculture could not properly supervise the distribution of cash advances, or seed. The duty of distributing advances, both in cash and in kind, was undertaken, therefore, by the civil authorities, and a preliminary allotment was placed at their disposal for the purpose. It has been arranged between the Special Accounts Officer and the Audit Officer of the civil administration that proper accounts of disbursements and recoveries will be submitted periodically to the former. Again, expenditure on such items as Pumps, Ploughs and Plough cattle was incurred for the authorities in Mesopotamia by G-overnment Agents purchasing, on their behalf, in India. It was therefore impossible, as has already been shown in the matter of the purchase of pumps, for the Board of Agriculture to know to what extent their allotment under any of these heads had been drawn on on account of purchases made in India. The same remarks apply to purchases made in India on behalf of the Directorate of Irrigation of such articles as mathematical instruments, and, to a certain extent, to the valuation of stores supplied and services rendered by other departments in Mesopotamia, to both Directorates. The expenditure on all supplies purchased in India and in England is accepted as a final charge in the War Accounts in India or the War Accounts of the War Office, as the case may be, without the authorities in Mesopotamia being aware of any details of the purchases made on behalf of their several departments. The following arrangement has been made which should overcame this difficulty. In future, in the case of purchases made in England, the Special Accounts Officer will obtain particulars of the supplies taken on charge in the two Directorates and will value them in his accounts, with reference to the rates shown in the invoices obtained from the Controller of War Accounts in India. As regards purchases made in India, the Special Accounts Officer, in addition to obtaining information locally as to the quantities of supplies taken on charge in the Directorates, will receive monthly statements from the Controller of War Accounts in India showing articles supplied and the prices paid. These latter particulars will enable the Special Accounts Officer to check the information which he obtains locally, and to value the articles in his accounts. Similarly, the Special Accounts Officer will obtain information regarding stores supplied and services rendered by other Directorates and Departments within Mesopotamia. These will be valued in his accounts with reference to ascertained rates, or where these are not available, on an estimated basis. The foregoing procedure had already been adopted to*some extent, but was only fully elaborated during the course of my inquiry. These arrangements will not, however, prevent the authorities in India from purchasing in excess of the limits laid down under each head of the sanctioned estimates, with the result that the responsible authorities in Mesopotamia may not learn that the payments have been incurred until long after the limit of sanctioned expenditure has been passed. To remedy this defect it would seem to be necessary to provide that the Budget should be distiibuted so as to inform each officer employed in making purchases in India of the limit up to which he is authorized to spend money on behalf of the authorities in Mesopotamia, and that he should be required, if he desires to exceed the amount, to make an application for further sanction to the Financial Adviser (Military Finance). The latter authority could then at once consult the Financial Adviser in Mesopotamia in order to ascertain whether any addition to the purchasing power of an individual officer could be made by transfer from other sanctioned heads. Were it intended, which is most improbable, that any further money should in the future be contributed from Army Funds towards the development of Agriculture or Irrigation Schemes in Mesopotamia, such an arrangement would seem to provide all that is still needed to make the control on behalf of the Imperial Government effective. 10th March, 1919.

At a conference held on the 10th August, 1917, to discuss a scheme for the production of grain for the : force, the following officers attended :— Brigadier-General H. 0. Knox, C.M.G., President.

Captain Bowers, Superintending Engineer, Hindiyah. C. C. Garbett, Esq., I.C.S. Financial Adviser. The points raised in the attached memorandum were considered and discussed seriatim and the following decisions were unanimously arrived at:— (а) In view of the point raised by the Army Commander, the area selected for cultivation was amended as is now shown on the attached map. (б) The necessary seed and agricultural implements will be forthcoming ; the required labour can be secured, canals cleared and the whole scheme carried out successfully provided provisional sanction to the scheme is given at the latest by the loth August. (c) The maximum expenditure to be incurred is £400,000 and repayment, in the form of Government Revenue, will commence in June next and the crop should produce our requirements for the next year. {d) No extra personnel will be required beyond that asked for in No. 83, dated the 27th July, 1917, from Superintending Engineer, Hindiyah Irrigation Works. (e) The only disadvantage to the scheme is the risk of loss arising from possible international developments during the next ten months, and incurred by advancing loans, which will not be repaid until June, 1918. (f) In view of the shortages of shipping the disadvantage indicated is far outweighed by the advantage of securing our grain requirements in the country. {g) The collection of grain at centres and transportation to the river would present no difficulty. (h) The scheme was approved and recommended for adoption. (i) The proposal is put forward on military grounds. The Chief Political Officer, however, agreed that Mr. Garbett should administer the scheme with the existing revenue machinery. Memorandum. No. Q/1500/2. Dated \2th August, 1917. Forwarded.—The scheme has been approved of by the Army Commander in principle, and the necessary -sanction of the Government of India is being obtained. In anticipation of formal sanction, action can at once be taken to carry out the proposals outlined in Mr. Garbett’s scheme. (Signed) H. O. KNOX, Brigadier-General, D.Q.M.G. APPENDIX VI. •8650 W. Telegram (Word Code). From —-The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad. To —Foreign Secretary, Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. No. 6104. Dated the \lth {received the 18£A) December, 1917. Issue has arisen as to the rate at which civil administration of the occupied territories should be credited with the value of cereals supplied to Resources Department for needs of army. Cereals in question are Govern ment share received in kind from landowners in satisfaction of Government revenue dues. It is agreed that such should be paid for at fixed rate and not at current market price at the time of each transaction. Director, Local Resources, proposes assess values at approximately pre-war rates, e.g., barley Rs.56 per ton, wheat Rs. 84 per ton, whereas present market rates are barley 450, wheat 650. Revenue Department proposes barley 168, wheat 280, which are fair average rates under present conditions. Director, Local Resources, advances no special argument in support of his contention. Revenue Department urges that:— (1) Money has been cheapened and that the value of given quantity of grain no longer purchases same amount of any other commodity as it did before war. (2) Cost of revenue collection which is between 10 and 15 per cent, of the value of cereals collected at present prices of latter is shown in money at its present value. Acceptance of pre-war rates will throw disproportionate burden on revenues of occupied territories. (3) Some revenue grain has been disposed of to private individuals at prices greatly in excess of prices now proposed, e.g., barley Rs. 500 per ton, wheat Rs. 750 per ton. Similar questions have doubtless been raised and settled in India. As matter is one affecting finances of this country and involving large sums, I submit case for orders of Government with recommendation that proposals of Revenue Department be accepted. 9APPENDIX VII. Telegram No. 4710. Dated Wih April, 1918. From —The Secretary to the Government of India, Army Department. To —The General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Eorce, Baghdad. Please refer to telegram from Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad, to Foreign and Political Department, No. 6104, dated 17th December, 1917 (N.R.W.S.). Price to be charged for cereals supplied by civil administration of occupied territories to Resources Department for needs of Army. Similar general question is under consideration in India in respect of supphes of timber, etc., to His Majesty s Government, and decision will probably be that charge should be restricted to pre-war price plus allowance for increased cost to Government in obtaining supphes plus margin of 10 per cent. On similar basis, price to be charged y civil administration for barley supplies to military forces should be Rs. 115 per ton, viz. : pre-war pnce ol Rs. 50 plus Rs. 49 on account of increased cost of collection at (say) 12*5 per cent, of Rs. 450, minus Ks. 5b, plus Rs. 10, being margin of 10 per cent. , ^ * P Rate in case of wheat should be Rs. 170 per ton, viz.: pre-war price of Rs. 84 plus Rs. 771 on account of increased cost of collection at 12-5 pfer cent, of Rs. 650, minus Rs. 84, plus 15 on account of 10 per cent. &amp; Rates thus arrived at are approximately same as are being paid in India for barley and wheat The Civil Commissioner and your Financial Adviser should arrange for maintenance of proper records of such supplies to readily permit of necessary adjustments should His Majesty s Government desire any modification in the rates now communicated. APPENDIX VIII. Telegram No. Q/5521. From —The General, Baghdad. To —Army Department, Simla. Dated the kth May, 1918. Pre-war rates for cereals'as given therein are not quite correct.

Uyil Lommissione and my Financial Adviser agree that these are fair prices for grain taken for military use to date. As regar s rate for harvest now under collection, you will be addressed further m due course. Telegram No. 7054. From —Secretary to Government of India (Army Department). To —General, Baghdad. Dated, Simla, the 29th May, 1918. Your telegram of May 4th, No. Q/5521. Rates per ton wheat and barley accepted at Rs. 168 and Rs. 107 respectively.EXPLANATOEY NOTE TO STATEMENT (APPENDIX IX). The accounts of the scheme were kept by double entry on commercial lines, with no schedules, which would disclose periodically the expenditure of the various districts, and enable the Administrator to check his various disbursing officers. It is from this confusion that there arises the need of the entry of minus figures on the “ Advances ” side of the balance sheet. Grain was advanced in small quantities to certain military organisations (Supplies, Kemounts, Dairy Farms) from which no return was expected. It seems better to reduce this item from the liabilities and show it as an unrecovered asset. When similarly a Political Officer was sent to the district of Shamiyah at the close of 1917, the operations of the Irrigation Department had not extended to that district. The Political Officer expended Rs. 93,426 (£6,228) on Government canals. Ihis expenditure will be of a great permanent value in securing protection from floods and actually produced a large increase in Government revenue demands. As, however, the sum is not recoverable it should not have been debited against the budget of the scheme, which provides for recoverable expenditure on private canals, but should be shown as a final charge in the Irrigation expenditure of the year. This item has now been transferred in this manner and is therefore shown as a minus figure on the Advances side of the balance sheet. 17. The rates at which Indian seed grain is priced are : wheat Rs. 260 (£17£) per ton, barley Rs. 210- (£14) per ton. These figures are a modification of those arrived at by the Director of Local Resources as representing the cost of delivery of grain in Baghdad, viz. : wheat Rs. 280 (£18§) per ton, barley Rs. 215 (£14-J) per ton. The difference is due to the elimination of an obviously erroneous figure for river freight. The present figures have been arrived at in consultation with the Financial Adviser and represent the closest approximation to the real cost that can be arrived at. On both sides of the account revenue grain has been priced at the rates laid down by the Government of India for the delivery of cereals to the Army in their telegram No. Q/5521 of the 4th May, 1918. There is a “ loss ” also on rice. Rice was issued as a “ Scarcity Commodity,” in a starving country, at prices between Rs. 430 (£28§) and Rs. 470 (£31$) a ton. It was recovered, two tons for each ton advanced, when prices were down to Rs. 170 (£11$) the ton. Losses are less than they would have been owing to the Administrator having sold some of his seed wheat at Rs. 410 (£27$) and barley at Rs. 240 (£16).50 APPENDIX XI. Telegram P., No. X. 8238. Dated 22nd April, 1918. {Despatched 3.50 p.m., received 2.30 p.m., 23rd April, 1918.) From —The G.O.C., Force “ D,” Baghdad. To —-The Chief of the General Staff, Simla. Your 30003 of 16th April. Agricultural schemes in Mesopotamia. As regards my X. 7802 of the 6th April and paragraph 1 of your telegram, I would urge that, in view of the world shortage of food, it is of great importance to produce as much as possible in this country where production is cheaper than elsewhere and returns from crops will more than cover expenditure in first year (see my Q. 5057 of the 10th April). Based on present strength, requirements for army in the field are estimated at 265,000 tons grain and 200,000 tons bhoosa. Schemes now started are estimated to produce in 1919 from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 acres of wheat and barley according to whether I am given free hand and my reasonable requests for personnel and machinery are promptly met. Yield is estimated at \ ton per acre for good crop, \ ton per acre for poor crop. After allowing for requirements of civil population, the surplus available for Force may be roughly estimated at £ and will vary between 246,000 tons and 123,000 tons grain. Former figure estimated gave wheat 50,000 tons and barley 196,000 tons, provided production farms and agricultural staff are sanctioned. Tonnage bhoosa assumed to be same as grain and 35,000 tons good natural grass available. Foregoing figures do not include area food grains and fodder grown autumn harvest. Assuming the probable prices for 1919, it is estimated that a thousand lakhs will be saved compared with cost of import from overseas. First Harvest, 1918. £400,000 contemplated expenditure of which, owing to restrictions on purchase of machinery and reductions in seed advances, £200,000 remains unspent. For item exceeding £1,000,000 see Financial Adviser’s opinion given later. Additional Government land revenue originally estimated at 50,000 tons grain at Bs. 150, original estimate of 50,000 tons stands. . • Regarding alleged large financial loss : 1918 harvest gives estimated available surplus of 117,000 tons of transportable grain and 150,000 tons of bhossa for needs of the Force, and accommodation, machinery, roads and light railways will be available for 1919 harvest; there should also be available one-third of the bags provided this year. In Euphrates areas Rs. 21 lakhs (inclusive of cost of establishment) spent on extensions and maintenance of irrigation works during 1918. Recurring expenditure required on this irrigated area will be very much less in 1919. Advances of money unrecoverable may be estimated at Rs. 30,000 and on Indian seed wheat possibly Rs. 4,00,000, much of that sent having proved unsuitable to local conditions. Second Harvest, 1919.

You should please understand that all the figures given above are only rough estimates and will subsequently be subject to modification. Further, all estimates of supply to Force are conditional on necessary machinery being supplied, and on provision of extended railway and water transport, including light railways, to obviate animal transport. We have not yet received any of the machinery ordered from India with the exception of a few minor items. From the first paragraph of your telegram now under reply it is assumed that the scheme is generally approved. Instructions therefore given for extensions and improvements in irrigation channels and organisation of Arab cultivation to be started. Reference our A.A. 4722 of the 3rd February to the Chief of the General Staff, please say when irrigation subordinates asked for therein will be supplied. The execution of the complete programme depends on the early arrival of these men. Henderson has expressed the following opinion with regard to farms. Begins. Extensions of operations similar to those which War Office sanctioned last year requires large increase in facilities to give technical agricultural advice. No experimental farms were proposed, only production estates up to 20,000 acres and yielding 15,000 tons of grain, mainly wheat, gram and oats, which are required by Force. Quantity of wheat obtainable is insufficient, and oats and gram cannot be obtained locally. Present estimate of normal ratio of wheat to barley is 1 to 10. Farms will help administration to secure better ratio and will also assist sheep breeding. Future mutton supply giving anxiety. Army demands have very largely reduced flocks. Estates themselves will be valuable asset to Government. Ends. These views are strongly supported by me. Financial Adviser has been consulted. He states that, without delaying this report, it is not possible to examine in detail the figures put up ; but he points out that expenditure of £1,707,000 represents expenses incurred in purchase and collection for immediate issue of grain and bhoosa to Force ; and adds that, taking figures as approximately correct, barley grain works out to Rs. 194 per ton in Baghdad, and bhoosa at Fs. 54 per ton, against Rs. 390 and Rs. 305, which is the cost in Baghdad of imported barley and bhoosa. Regarding 1919, he adds that the figures were obtained at round table conferences and they will not be available for his scrutiny for some time. I would urge that the responsibility rests with myself and Civil Commissioner and we should have a free hand to modify schemes to any extent found necessary. It is impossible to foresee the political or military developments for next six months, but these may have profound effect on schemes. Henderson, who has left in return to India, is cognizant of conditions here and has been authorised to represent my views. APPENDIX XII. Telegram No. 7373. D.Q.M.G. Dated the \ith May, 1918. Erom —The Secretary, War Office, London. To—The Commander-in-Chief in India, Simla. Your telegram of the 26th April, 32877. Scheme sanctioned subject to conditions at end of your telegram. Marshall to see that expenditure is limited to immediate food development and that complete and accurate account of operations kept. Proposals regarding our control follow.APPENDIX XIII. Dated, Simla, the 27th May, 1918. Letter No. 1597-3. (Q.M.G. 9.) From —The Quartermaster-General in India ZV-The General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. _ I am directed by the Commander-in-Chief to confirm the following telegram which was despatched to you on the 15th instant:— “ Referring to my 30,003, 16th April. Scheme for agricultural development for next year has been approved by Army Council subject to condition that expenditure is limited to immediate food development, and that a complete and accurate record of all items of expenditure and receipts, which have a bearing on the ultimate results of the scheme, is maintained. Regarding latter point further instructions will follow. Evans embarks for Basrah to take up appointment of Director of Agriculture about 26th May.” 2. His Excellency has had under consideration the procedure which would best ensure giving effect to the above instructions of the Army Council. He observes that the scheme for agricultural development sanctioned by the Council involves the co-operation of two Directorates the Directorate of Agriculture and Directorate of Irrigation—in close consultation with the staff of the Civil Commissioner of the occupied territory. Large financial transactions are also involved, as regards which the Army Council have particularly desired that a complete and accurate record of all items of expenditure and receipts having a bearing on the ultimate results of the scheme should be maintained. . . . It is observed further, that in the report rendered by Mr. Henderson, the Imperial Agriculturist lent by the Government of India to advise as to the development of the scheme, it is strongly recommended that a Committee should be formed under the presidency of your Deputy Quartermaster-General composed of a representative of the Civil Commissioner, and the Directors of Irrigation and Agriculture as well as certain Ull dn fir ■other members. _ , The Commander-in-Chief understands that this proposal was considered at a Conference held at Baghdad on the 18th April last, presided over by the Deputy Quartermaster-General, and was concurred in generally in principle. _ _ . 3. The Commander-in-Chief approves of the proposal but thinks it necessary that the functions of this body should not be merely advisory but should be those of a board with definite responsibility, both executive and financial, subject to such orders and directions as you may deem desirable to issue from time to time through the Deputy Quartermaster-General. The formation of a responsible board of this nature will ensure due co-ordination of the work of the two directors principally concerned, as well as constant and complete financial control. The Board should, therefore, be composed as follows :— Major-General The Hon. A. R. Montagu Stuart-Wortley, C.B., D.S.O., D.Q.M.G., Chairman ; A representative of the Civil Commissioner ; A Director of Agriculture ; A Director of Irrigation ; and The Financial Adviser. The Board should be given such secretarial assistance as may be deemed advisable. It will probably prove desirable that a member of the Financial Adviser’s staff should be placed at the disposal of the Board for the purpose of keeping a financial record. It is conceived that although the work of the Board may entail frequent reference to the Directorates of Labour, and of Supply and Transport, it is unnecessary that the heads of these Directorates should be added to the Board, but this is a matter which is left to your discretion. 4. As regards the recommendation submitted by Mr. Henderson in his report that a Committee should be constituted in India for despatch of supplies required from time to time, I am to inform you that the Government of India have decided to add for that purpose Lieutenant-Colonel Hallowes, Director of Farms in India, and Mr. G. S. Henderson, Imperial Agriculturist, to a Board which, under the Chairmanship of the Hon. Sir Claude Hill, is about to be formed to advise on questions connected with food supply. This Board which will be called the Central Transport and Foodstuffs Board will be advisory to the Government of India, but will correspond direct with similar organizations in the provinces. The Board to be formed in Meso potamia should address all demands for agricultural implements, &amp;c., to the Secretary, Central Transport and Foodstuffs Board. The latter Board will arrange to meet these demands in consultation with the Quarter master-General in India. It is considered that in this way your requirements will be more rapidly met and the co-operation of Local Governments more rapidly obtained. 5. It is desired that your Financial Adviser shall keep himself in close and constant touch with the progress of the operations, and it will be his primary duty to assist you in securing observance of the primary conditions laid down by the War Office, viz. : that expenditure shall be limited to immediate food developments. As regards the War Office requirement that complete and accurate account of the operations should be kept, it is desired that all accounts of the operations should be submitted in the first instance by the Disbursing and Receiving Officers to the Special Accounts Officer attached to the Board, of whom mention has been made in paragraph 3 above. The Special Accounts Officer will then compile all accounts in such form as may be finally agreed upon by the Board, acting on the recommendation of the Financial Officer and approved by you, subject to the final acceptance of the Government of India. The accounts compiled in this form will then be submitted and incorporated in the field classified abstract of the Field Controller of Military Supply Accounts, Basrah. The latter will then forward a certified copy of the account each month to the Controller of War Accounts in India. 6. In addition to the above, the Financial Adviser will be expected to submit through you, for the information of the Government of India, a quarterly review of the expenditure actually incurred in connection with the scheme. The ultimate object of this review is that the Government of India may be in a position to furnish the Army Council with information regarding the progress of the scheme of the kind which it is evident from the correspondence that the Army Council desire to receive. 7. It is requested that the proposal as regards form of accounts to be adopted should be submitted to the Government of India without delay. Generally speaking, the heads of accounts should follow those included in telegram No. 30,003, dated the 16th May, 1918, though your Financial Adviser will no doubt consider whether some further details will not be necessary. The form of accounts which your financial adviser considers suitable should be adopted provisionally at once without waiting for the final instructions of the Government of India on the subject.Directorate for lack of information, so that I am unable to say what proportion they bear to the total supplied) and assuming that other minor departments also will spend as much for Irrigation from November to March as was spent from April to November, we could make the following estimate for the year now ending Already accounted for ... ... ... ... ... 44 38 000 Add Irrigation, December to March 12,80*000 Add “ Labour,” December to March (14,41 + 50 per cent.) 21*61*000 Add “Park” Stores, December to March ... ... 4,50,000 Add Miscellaneous Minor Directorates ... ... ... 1,33,000 £ (295,867) (85,333) (144,066) (30,000) (8,867) The total for Works only, may be estimated at 84,62,000 (564,133) The figure is only put forward as an estimate. It may be five lakhs, it may even be ten lakhs out either way. I should think that plus or minus five lakhs (£35,000) would probably be about correct. 5. Passing to Mr. Ward’s figures for Establishment, viz.:— Executive Es. 14,00,000 (£93,333), Direction Ks. 1,35,000 (£9,000), these figures were made out by me m consultation with the Director. We assumed that the sanctioned War Establishment would be filled quicker than it was ; we had no definite information of what the rate of pay of officers would be, for Indian staff we put down roughly double of what similar employees would get in India. We did not include the cost of rationing the staff. The figures of expenditure [booked to the end of October, estimated from November to March (on the October figures)] are :—■ v Executive Superintendence and Direction Total Rs. 11,83,000 2,74,000 14,57,000 (£97,133) against the forecast of Rs. 15,35,000 (£102,333). Rs. 14,57,000 includes rations. The forecast did not. ^ tr ? Sp °^ Mr - d ® stimated 2,50,000 (£16,666). This figure also was taken out in consultation with the Director and myself I cannot trace the papers on which we worked out the figure, but my recollection is, that, having no definite information of the cost of transport, we put down a tentative figure which we thought might cover the cost. &amp; 6 The monthly average number of motor cars, motor bicycles, and motor or steam boats employed to date over the nine months, May to January (records are incomplete before May) is Motor cars (mostly “ Fords ”) 23 Motorbicycles ... ... ... ... ... ’ ^ Water transport ... ... ... ... ... ” 20 This includes oniy transport “ on charge ” for District Officers. I have no figures yet for transport for W .°D • o kmg t ' i f approximate cost of running and maintaining a Ford car at Es. 500 and a motor cycle at Es 100 a month, this gives us a figure of Es. 1,10,000 for cars and motor cycles alone as debitable to the Directorate for these nine months. Of Water transport I have no information beyond the fact that an average of 20 launches of sorts has been allotted for a period of nine months. I am informed that there was one “ stem wheeler ” attached to the Directorate for six months, which was hired from her owners at Rs. 170 a day (say Rs. 5,000 a month) for hire charges alone—-apart from the cost of fuel and running expenses. I do not think that there will be on Jv akhs ] f e Z eT 1 can a f lve at an approximately correct figure. I think that probably 3 lakhs (£20,000) would be a safer figure to take as an estimate of the probable expenditure to the end of March We might summarise the figures given above and note that the best forecast that can now be made of the probable expenditure of Irrigation Directorate for the financial year 1918-1919 will be Rs. £ 84,62,000 (564,133) (97,133) (includes charges for horses ; and rations of all kinds) (20,000) (mechanical transport for District and touring Officers only) Works ...

Copy of a letter No. E.S./547 of the 7th May, 1918, from Deputy Director of Works (Electrical and Mechanical), Basrah, to Lieut. Campbell Rogers, Assistant Political Officer, Baghdad. Subject .—Your deputation to India in connection with purchase of pumping plants, 1. With reference to Administrator, A.D. Scheme, letter No. 8029, dated the 28th April, 1918, attached hereto is a copy of the general specification for these pumping sets. This specification is to be taken as a general guide only, and you are at liberty to depart from it in any detail which will facilitate the supply of plant from India, but radical alterations are not to be made in the specification without my approva . 2. Every endeavour is to be made to obtain pumping sets having oil engines as prime movers. The type of oil engine suitable is the Horizontal slow speed type, burning crude or refined oil. High speed direct coupled sets are not to be accepted without my sanction. 3. Twelve pumping plants having steam portables as prime movers are to be inspected and shipped as soon as possible, and a telegraphic report is to be forwarded from time to time informing the A., A.D. scheme, the approximate number of pumping sets driven by oil engines and steam engines which are obtainable a,n definite instructions regarding the further supply of steam driven pumping sets will be sent to you. 4. Copies of telegrams No. Q 2/5350, dated the 26th April, from General, Baghdad to C.G.S., India, and Works telegram No. W/1808, dated the 6th May, 1918, to War Section, Simla, are attached for information Each pumping plant should be given a serial number and all component parts, packages, &amp;c., of each set should bear the number in addition to the package number on the manifest. Example A.A.D. 1 Set number. 35 Package number. 5 You will note that the specification calls for pumps capable of dealing with a maximum head of 35 feet •fi o cnntirm lipari of 60 ner cent of this figure. The actual working heads on pumps will probably be 17, 22 and 35 feet The bulk of the low lift pumps available in the Indian market wU deal with heads varying fr 0m i 6 to 35 feet, with reasonable efficiency'when working at difierent speeds. You should arrange as fer as possible that all pumps are suitable for working on these different heads by sending suitable pulleys and or any other matter in connection with plant and machine^ unto demand am Jbe acidressed to Revenue, Baghdad, and repeated to Works, Basrah, and not to Col. Pitkeathly personally. , 7. These instructions modify those contained in A.A.D. letter No. 8029, dated the 28th April, in so far as thev concern intimation of shipping, &amp;c. 8 1 attach hereto a list of firms and people in India who may be able to give you information and advice rega ffi7cop7c“thfettter and enclosures should be handed to the Secretary, Munitions Board, on your arrival in India.APPENDIX XIX.

APPENDIX XX. Extract from a letter No. 22823/99/11, dated the 20th October, 1918, from Civil Commissioner, to General Headquarters. * * * * 3. As regards Appendix “A.” I would remark that the collection of the harvest can probably be arranged by the Civil Administration, but it does not follow that it would be done by the Agricultural Depart ment which will presumably by next summer be part of the Civil Administration. Copy of a Memorandum No. 28739/99/11, dated the 9th December, 1918, from the Civil Commissioner, to General Headquarters. ^ Your Q/2698/1 of the 19th October. In amplification of para. 3 of my 22823, of the 20th October, I beg to place on record the following preliminary expression of opinion. 2. If the force in this country is to be reduced as proposed the amount of grain required is not likely to exceed say 16,000 tons. I am of opinion that it should be possible for the S. &amp; T. to purchase the whole of this amount by open contract. I should however be prepared to guarantee to deliver on rail from Government stock such additional quantities as may be required in special cases to supplement contract supply, without the intervention of the Local Resources Department. 3. I may mention that I do not propose next year to collect Revenue in kind except in special casest it is financially much more advantageous to Government and far less trouble (i.e., less expensive in staff and in losses, &amp;c.) to collect in cash. 4. In the altered conditions of the Civil Government which will result from the termination of the war it would no longer be possible to fix an arbitrary price for grain and dispose of the revenue of the country, even if collected in kind, at prices below their value. The difference between the cost of revenue in grain and grain purchased by contract would be small, certainly far less than the cost of keeping up the requisite military establishments. In addition by ceasing to collect revenue in kind, we shall be spared the very heavy incidental charges such as loss in transit, and in storage, rentals, &amp;c. 5. If these views are accepted, the Resources Department could so far as grain collection on the Euphrates is concerned be wound up during the first four months of 1919. 6. I should perhaps add that the decision to collect revenue in kind for the period of the war was come to voluntarily by this office on its own initiative to meet a military emergency, but I should not, after the experiences we have gained as to its working feel justified in maintaining it a moment longer than proved to be necessary as an urgent Military necessity. I will not go into reasons in detail at this juncture but venture to assure you that the arguments against this course are so urgent as to be from my point of view conclusive.Total ... 9,90,000 (£66,000), APPENDIX XXIJ.
