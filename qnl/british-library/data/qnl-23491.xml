Would you kindly let me know, no doubt after consulting the foreign and Political Department, what reply it is re commended should be sent to Delevingne. We should be glad of a very early reply because, as you will see, Delevingne would like to know how the matter stands before the Supervisory Body meets again at the begin ning of October, and we shall probably want t o refer to the rnk Political Department here, after receiving your reply, before we send it on.

India Office. I have been out to Geneva for a meeting of the Super visory Body under the Drugs Limitation Convention of 1931; and in the course of the proceedings our attention was called to the fact that exports of the drugs to Bahrain and Nepal had been reported to the Central Opium Board (to Bahrain from G r eat Britain; to Nepal, from Great Britain and from India) but that no estimates had been submitted separately ^ J f i n respect of these territories under Article 5 of the Limitation Convention. In t he case of Bghrain, the Board, I '' «aii on inquiry, had been informed that the import certificates were issued by the British Political Agent, who is appointed by the Government of India. Can you tell me how these two places are regarded by the India Office and Indian Govern- jment for the purpose of the application of the Opium and &gt; ~ 1 / Drugs Conventions of 1925 and 1931? Are they being treated as part of H India w ? If so, exports to them from Great Britain had better be reported to Geneva as e xports to India; and exports from India to either place had better not, in the w export returns made to Geneva, be included at all. Adeiji seems / a parallel case, and if I remember rightly, it is treated for these purposes as a part of India. Perhaps you could verify this. And how about the other places on the Gulf? On the other hand, if they are not treated for the purposes of the estimates submitted by India under Article 5 of the Convention of 1931 as part of India, the separate esti mates ought to be submitted in respect of them. If you would like to see me on the subject, I can look in at the India Office some day. The Supervisory Body meets again^ at beginning of Octo ber to complete it_s work and I should be glad to know how the matter stands before then. % Ht tCopy of D.O.

We have now received a letter from the Home Office dated 4th February of which I enclose a copy, stating that no estimates are 1936 submitted in respect of either Nepal or Bahrain, and des cribing the procedure which is followed when drugs are ex ported from the United Kingdom to these places. You will see that ihey come to the conclusion that both Nepal and , ^ Bahrain should be treated as Non-Convention Countries. Article 2 (3) of the Drugs Limitation Convention of 1931 is to the effect that estimates for such countries should either be furnished by the countries themselves, at the request of the Permanent Central Board, or failing this, that they should be compiled by the Supervisory Board. 3. Either of these courses might lead to the establish ment of closer relations than have existed hitherto between these places and Geneva. We can see no objection to the Secretariat of the League communicating with the Nepalese Government requesting estimates, or since the foreign rela tions of the Persian Gulf States are conducted by His Majesty's Government, to the League asking His Majesty^ Government to furnish them with estimates for Bahrain. Since His Majesty's Government would oe conducting the cones- pondence on behalf of Bahrain, the question of Bahrain be coming a party to t he Convention could hardly arise. Similar Considerations apply to the other Persian Gulf States and Muscat, and estimates could probably be obtained through t/.-u Political Arentcthrough the Political Agents. As regards Nepali there would probably be no objection to her becoming a party to the Con vention if she so desired. 4. It appears to us more satisfactory for the matter to deve* lop on these lines than for the Government of India to furnish separately estimates of drugs to be imported into these terri tories through India, as you suggest in your letter under reply. Such a procedure might be regarded as incompatible with the status of Nepal and Bahrain, and it is doubtful whether it would satisfy the Supervisory: Board. 5. It therefore appears that ^epal, Bahrain and other Arab States in the Persian Gulf must be treated for the purpose of estimates as coming under Article 2(3), and we propose to write in this sense to Sir Malcolm Delevingne, who first raised the question (see my demi official letter No. E &amp; 0.5757/35 of the 30th August 1935), explaining at the same time that His Majesty^ Government conducts the foreign relations of the Gulf States. Before doing so, however, we should be glad to know whether you concur.HOME OFFICE, White Hall, S.W. 1 582,157/20 4th Februaryn 1936. 593,731/14 Dear Tomkins, You will remember that some time ago you asked me to look into the position in regard to the estimates in respect of Nepal and Bahrain, Quite shortly, the position appears to be that no estimates are submitted in respect of either State. When in 1930 Nepal commenced to import drugs from the United Kingdom, vie asked that the British Envoy at the Court of Nepal be requested to suggest to the Nepalese Government the adoption of a procedure similar to that under the Conven tion of 1925. This was done. (See E &amp; 0.5563/50). In 1931 and 1932 we agreed to issue licences for the export of drugs to Nepal on production of a certificate. or requisition countersigned by the British Envoy. It was also agreed that drugs exported under this procedure shouldbe shown in the statistics of exports furnished by the United Kingdom to the League, as exports to Nepal. This hafc- been done. It was also suggested, in order to prevent discrepan cies between United Kingdom export statistics and Indian import statistics, that India should regard these consignments as M in transit' to Nepal. E &amp; 0. 8955/31; E id 0.616/32; B &amp; 0.3890/32 K A; 0. 5369/32 refer. We send the usual duplicates of the export licences to the British Envoy, but so far he does not appear to have endorsed and returned them. We also send of an extra duplicate to the Central Board^Revenue who endorse and return their copy as if the goods were imported into India. There is, therefore, a semblance of the import certificate system in force betv/een Nepa3. and the United Kingdom, but no sort of compliance with the Convention of 1931 in the matter of returns, estimates, etc., nor can 1 find any record of any-4- vl suggestion that Nepal should render returns, or submit estir mates. In fact, I gather from the correspondence that Nepal is an independent sovereign State; that she has not ratified any of the Conventions, and that you, or the Government of India, are averse from her having any direct relations with the League of Nations* If she is not to haves such relations she cannot ratify the Conventions, and cannot, I imagine, make any returns, or submit estimates. It there fore seems that the true position of this State is that of a Non-Convention Country, and it seems to me that probably the best solution in these circumstances is for Nepal to be regarded as a Non-Convention Country, and for the Supervisory Body to insert in their Tables an estimate of the drugs required. With regard to Bahrain, the position seems tobe much the same as in Nepal. After some correspondence with the India Office (See P 3537 of 1923, and P 2880 of 1924) it was recognised that there were difficulties in the way of intro ducing a regular import certificate procedure, and it was decided that the most natural and satisfactory Licensing Autho rity would be the British Political Officer stationed there, but you pointed out that any claim that the British Political Officer should be recognised for international purposes as exercising any power in this matter, would give rise to diffi culties. We have accordingly issued licences for the ex. ort of drugs to Bahrain, on ceitificates issued by the Political ^ that Agent toX the effect/there was M no obJeBtion 1 * to the import. A copy of eachlicence is regularly sent to the Political Agent 1* I but, as in the case of the Envoy at Nepal, he does not appear /I, VvVH' f- to return them. So far as 1 can trace, no suggestion has ever been made that Bahrain should make any returns, or submit estimates to the League, and I think it is certain that they have not, up to the present, done so, nor has anyone else done it for them. Their position seems the re fore, to be exactly.-5 - that of a Non-Convention Country, and unless it is thought desirable that India should assume any responsibility in this respect for Bahrain, it would seem that they had better remain in this position, and let the Supervisory Board estimate for them. You will appreciate, of course, that what has been said regarding B a hrain applies in respect of Muskat and Kuwait.

Dear Sir Malcolm, I must apologise for the length of tdfte it has taken to reply to the questions ^ihich you first raised in your letter to Tomkins flf the 23th August last, about the submission of estimates in respect of Nepal and Bahrein under the Drug Limitation Convention of 19 1.The position at present is ttu-t no separate estimates are submitted in respect of tuese territories, they neither are nor c^n be treated as part of India* Nepal is an independent sovereign state and must be^tr^ted as a non-oonvention country under Vo Article 2(3) of the 1931 Convention. V*e see oh - objection to the League Secretariat Com nun i eating with the Nepalese Government requesting estimates. As regards Bahrein and the other Gulf States the position is different in that they are in treaty relations with His Majesty^ Governe-mnt whereby His Majesty's Government conducts their foreign relations (this is not tirue of Muscat but as a matter of convenience the Sultan generally communicates with other powers through His M&amp;jesty^s Government). The League Secretariat cannot therefore correspond with them direct# «&lt;e are howev er of opinion (and the Foreign office concur) thfc t they should be tre ted as falling under Article 2(5) of the Convention and if the League should wish to ask for esti mates under this section for any of them the correct precedurp would be for the enquiry to Ifce addressed to His Majesty^ Government who would take steps to obtain the necessary particulars. I need hardly say that we should prefer to let this sleeping dog lie but we feel it is desirable to let -.itfiu know j&amp;e position in case the question should a rain be raised.

Each High Contracting Party shall furnish annually, for each of the drugs in respect of each of his territories to which this Convention applies, to the Permanent Central Board, constituted under Chapter VI of the Geneva Convention, estimates in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of this Convention. 2. In the event of any High Contracting Party failing to furnish, by the date specified in paragraph 4 of Article 5, an estimate in respect of any of his territories to which this Convention applies, an estimate will, so far as possible, be furnished by the Supervisory Body specified in paragraph 6 of Article 5. 3. The Permanent Central Board shall request estimates for countries or territories to which this Convention does not apply to be made in accordance with the provisions of this Convention. If for any such country estimates are not furnished, the Supervisory Body shall itself, as far as possible, make the estimate. Article 3. Any High Contracting Party may, if necessary, in any year furnish in respect of any of his territories supplementary estimates for that territory for that year with an explanation of the circumstances which necessitate such supplementary estimates.Article 4. 1. Every estimate furnished in accordance with the preceding Articles, so far as it relates to any of the drugs required for domestic consumption in the country or territory in respect of which it is made, shall be based solely on the medical and scientific requirements of that country or territory. 2. The High Contracting Parties may, in addition to reserve stocks, create and maintain Government stocks. A rticle 5. 1. Each estimate provided for in Articles 2 to 4 of this Convention shall be in the form from time to time prescribed by the Permanent Central Board and communicated by the Board to all the Members of the League of Nations and to the non-member States mentioned in Article 27. 2. Every estimate shall show for each country or territory for each year in respect of each of the drugs whether in the form of the alkaloid or salts or of preparations of the alkaloids or salts: [а) The quantity necessary for use as such for medical and scientific needs, including the quantity required for the manufacture of preparations for the export of which export authorisations are not required, whether such preparations are intended for domestic consump tion or for export ; (б) The quantity necessary for the purpose of conversion, whether for domestic consumption or for export; (c) The amount of the reserve stocks which it is desired to maintain: (d) The quantity required for the establishment and maintenance of any Government stocks as provided for in Article 4. The total of the estimates for each country or territory shall consist of the sum of the amounts specified under (a) and (b) of this paragraph with the addition of any amounts which may be necessary to bring the reserve stocks and the Government stocks up to the desired level, or after deduction of any amounts by which those stocks may exceed that level. These additions or deductions shall, however, not be taken into account except in so far as the High Contracting Parties concerned shall have forwarded in due course the necessary estimates to the Permanent Central Board. 3. Every estimate shall be accompanied by a statement explaining the method by which the several amounts shown in it have been calculated. If these amounts are calculated so as to include a margin allowing for possible fluctuations in demand, the estimates must indicate the extent of the margin so included. It is understood that in the case of any of the drugs which are or may be included in Group II, a wider margin may be necessary than in the case of the other drugs. 4. Every estimate shall reach the Permanent Central Board not later than August 1st in the year preceding that in respect of which the estimate is made. 5. Supplementary estimates shall be sent to the Permanent Central Board immediately on their completion. 6. The estimates will be examined by a Supervisory Body. The Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Opium and other Dangerous Drugs of the League of Nations, the Permanent Central Board, the Health Committee of the League of Nations and the Office international d'Hygiene publique shall each have the right to appoint one member of this Body. The Secretariat of the Supervisory Body shall be provided by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, who will ensure close collaboration with the Permanent Central Board. The Supervisory Body may require any further information or details, except as regards requirements for Government purposes, which it may consider necessary, in respect of any country or territory oil behalf of which an estimate has been furnished in order to make the estimate complete or to explain any statement made therein, and may, with the consent of the Government concerned, amend any estimate in accordance with any information or details so obtained. It is understood that in the case of any of the drugs which are or may be included in Group II a summary statement shall be sufficient. 7. After examination by the Supervisory Body as provided in paragraph 6 above of the esti mates furnished, and after the determination by that Body as provided in Article 2 of the estimates for each country or territory on behalf of which no estimates have been furnished, the Supervisory Body shall forward, not later than November 1st in each year, through the intermediary of the Secretary-General, to all the Members of the League of Nations and non-member States referred to in Article 27, a statement containing the estimates for each country or territory, and, so far as the Supervisory Body may consider necessary, an account of any explanations given or required in accordance with paragraph 6 above, and any observations which the Supervisory Body may desire to make in respect of any such estimate or explanation, or request for an explanation. 8. Every supplementary estimate sent to the Permanent Central Board in the course of the year shall be dealt with without delay by the Supervisory Body in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraphs 6 and 7 above.Chapter III. — Limitation of Manufacture. Article 6. 1. There shall not be manufactured in any country or territory in any one year a quantity of any of the drugs greater than the total of the following quantities: {a) The quantity required within the limits of the estimates for that country or territory for that year for use as such for its medical and scientific needs including the quantity required for the manufacture of preparations for the export of which export authorisations are not required, whether such preparations are intended for domestic consumption or for export; (6) The quantity required within the limits of the estimates for that country or territory for that year for conversion, whether for domestic consumption or for export; (c) Such quantity as may be required by that country or territory for the execution during the year of orders for export in accordance with the provisions of this Convention; (d) The quantity, if any, required by that country or territory for the purpose of main taining the reserve stocks at the level specified in the estimates for that year; (&lt;?) The quantity, if any, required for the purpose of maintaining the Government stocks at the level specified in the estimates for that year. 2. It is understood that, if at the end of any year, any High Contracting Party finds that the amount manufactured exceeds the total of the amounts specified above, less any deductions made under Article 7, paragraph 1, such excess shall be deducted from the amount to be manufactured during the following year. In forwarding their annual statistics to the Permanent Central Board, the High Contracting Parties shall give the reasons for any such excess. Article 7. There shall be deducted from the total quantity of each drug permitted under Article 6 to be manufactured in any country or territory during any one year: (i) Any amounts of that drug imported including any returned deliveries of the drug, less quantities re-exported. (ii) Any amounts of the drug seized and utilised as such for domestic consumption or for conversion. If it should be impossible to make any of the above deductions during the course of the current year, any amounts remaining in excess at the end of the year shall be deducted from the estimates for the following year. Article 8. The full amount of any of the drugs imported into or manufactured in any country or territory for the purpose of conversion in accordance with the estimates for that country or territory shall, if possible, be utilised for that purpose within the period for which the estimate applies. In the event, however, of it being impossible to utilise the full amount for that purpose within the period in question, the portion remaining unused at the end of the year shall be deducted from the estimates for that country or territory for the following year. Article 9. If at the moment when all the provisions of the Convention shall have come into force, the then existing stocks of any of the drugs in any country or territory exceeds the amount of the reserve stocks of that drug, which, according to the estimates for that country or territory, it is desired to maintain, such excess shall be deducted from the quantity which, during the year, could ordinarily be imported or manufactured as the case may be under the provisions of this Convention. Alternatively, the excess stocks existing at the moment when all the provisions of the Convention shall have come into force shall be taken possession of by the Government and released from time to time in such quantities only as may be in conformity with the present Convention. Any quantities so released during any year shall be deducted from the total amount to be manu factured or imported as the case may be during that year. Chapter IV. — Prohibitions and Restrictions. Article 10. 1. The High Contracting Parties shall prohibit the export from their territories of diacetyl- morphine, its salts, and preparations containing diacetylmorphine, or its salts.2. Nevertheless, on the receipt of a request from the Government of any country in which diacetylmorphine is not manufactured, any High Contracting Party may authorise the export to that country of such quantities of diacetylmorphine, its salts, and preparations containing diacetylmorphine or its salts, as are necessary for the medical and scientific needs of that country, provided that the request is accompanied by an import certificate and is consigned to the Government Department indicated in the certificate. 3. Any quantities so imported shall be distributed by and on the responsibility of the Government of the importing country. Article 11. 1. No trade in or manufacture for trade of any product obtained from any of the phen- anthrene alkaloids of opium or from the ecgonine alkaloids of the coca leaf, not in use on this day's date for medical or scientific purposes shall take place in any country or territory unless and until it has been ascertained to the satisfaction of the Government concerned that the product in question is of medical or scientific value. In this case (unless the Government determines that such product is not capable of producing addiction or of conversion into a product capable of producing addiction) the quantities permitted to be manufactured, pending the decision hereinafter referred to, shall not exceed the total of the domestic requirements of the country or territory for medical and scientific needs, and the quantity required for export orders and the provisions of this Convention shall apply. 2. Any High Contracting Party permitting trade in or manufacture for trade of any such product to be commenced shall immediately send a notification to that effect to the Secretary- General of the League of Nations, who shall advise the other High Contracting Parties and the Health Committee of the League. 3. The Health Committee will thereupon, after consulting the Permanent Committee of the Office international d'Hygiene publique, decide whether the product in question is capable of producing addiction (and is in consequence assimilable to the drugs mentioned in Sub-group {a) of Group I), or whether it is convertible into such a drug (and is in consequence assimilable to the drugs mentioned in Sub-group {b) of Group I or in Group II). 4. In the event of the Health Committee deciding that the product is not itself a drug capable of producing addiction, but is convertible into such a drug, the question whether the drug in question shall fall under sub-group (6) of Group I or under Group II shall be referred for decision to a body of three experts competent to deal with the scientific and technical aspects of the matter, of whom one member shall be selected by the Government concerned, one by the Opium Advisory Committee of the League, and the third by the two members so selected. 5. Any decisions arrived at in accordance with the two preceding paragraphs shall be notified to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, who will communicate it to all the Members of the League and to the non-member States mentioned in Article 27. 6. If the decisions are to the effect that the product in question is capable of producing addiction or is convertible into a drug capable of producing addiction, the High Contracting Parties will, upon receipt of the communication from the Secretary-General, apply to the drug the appropriate regime laid down in the present Convention according as to whether it falls under Group I or under Group II. 7. Any such decisions may be revised, in accordance with the foregoing procedure, in the light of further experience, on an application addressed by any High Contracting Party to the Secretary-General. Article 12. 1. No import of any of the drugs into the territories of any High Contracting Party or export from those territories shall take place except in accordance with the provisions of this Convention. 2. The imports in any one year into any country or territory of any of the drugs shall not exceed the total of the estimates as defined in Article 5 and of the amount exported from that country or territory during the year, less the amount manufactured in that country or territory in that year. Chapter V. — Control. Article 13. 1. [a) The High Contracting Parties shall apply to all the drugs in Group I the provisions of the Geneva Convention which are thereby applied to substances specified in its fourth Article (or provisions in conformity therewith). The High Contracting Parties shall also apply these provisions to preparations made from morphine and cocaine and covered by Article 4 of the Geneva Convention and to all other preparations made from the other drugs in Group I except such preparations as may be exempted from the provisions of the Geneva Convention under its eighth Article. (6) The High Contracting Parties shall treat solutions or dilutions of morphine or cocaine or their salts in an inert substance, liquid or solid, which contain 0.2 per cent or less of morphine or 0.1 per cent or less of cocaine in the same way as preparations containing more than these percentages.2. The High Contracting Parties shall apply to the drugs which are or may be included in Group II the following provisions of the Geneva Convention (or provisions in conformity therewith): [а) The provisions of Articles 6 and 7 in so far as they relate to the manufacture, import, export and wholesale trade in those drugs; (б) The provisions of Chapter V, except as regards compounds containing any of these drugs which are adapted to a normal therapeutic use; (c) The provisions of paragraphs 1 (6), (c) and [e) and paragraph 2 of Article 22, provided: (i) That the statistics cf import and export may be sent annually instead of quarterly, and (ii) That paragraph 1 [h) and paragraph 2 of Article 22 shall not apply to preparations containing any of these drugs. Article 14. 1. Any Government which has issued an authorisation for the export of any of the drugs which are or may be included in Group I to any country or territory to which neither this Convention nor the Geneva Convention applies shall immediately notify the Permanent Central Board of the issue of the authorisation; provided that, if the request for export amounts to 5 kilogrammes or more, the authorisation shall not be issued until the Government has ascertained from the Permanent Central Board that the export will not cause the estimates for the importing country or territory to be exceeded. If the Permanent Central Board sends a notification that such an excess would be caused, the Government will not authorise the export of any amount which would have that effect. 2. If it appears from the import and export returns made to the Permanent Central Board or from the notifications made to the Board in pursuance of the preceding paragraph that the quantity exported or authorised to be exported to any country or territory exceeds the total of the estimates for that country or territory as defined in Article 5, with the addition of the amounts shown to have been exported, the Board shall immediately notify the fact to all the High Contracting Parties, who will not, during the currency of the year in question, authorise any new exports to that country except: (i) In the event of a supplementary estimate being furnished for that country in respect both of any quantity over-imported and of the additional quantity required; or (ii) In exceptional cases where the export in the opinion of the Government of the exporting country is essential in the interests of humanity or for the treatment of the sick. 3. The Permanent Central Board shall each year prepare a statement showing, in respect of each country or territory for the preceding year: (a) The estimates in respect of each drug; \h) The amount of each drug consumed; (c) The amount of each drug manufactured; (d) The amount of each drug converted; (e) The amount of each drug imported; (/) The amount of each drug exported; (g) The amount of each drug used for the compounding of preparations, exports of which do not require export authorisations. If such statement indicates that any High Contracting Party has or may have failed to carry out his obligations under this Convention, the Board shall have the right to ask for explanations, through the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, from that High Contracting Party, and the procedure specified in paragraphs 2 to 7 of Article 24 of the Geneva Convention shall apply in any such case. The Board shall, as soon as possible thereafter, publish the statement above mentioned together with an account, unless it thinks it unnecessary, of any explanations given or required in accordance with the preceding paragraph and any observations which the Board may desire to make in respect of any such explanation or request for an explanation. The Permanent Central Board shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the statistics and other information which it receives under this Convention shall not be made public in such a manner as to facilitate the operations of speculators or to injure the legitimate commerce of any High Contracting Party. Chapter VI. — Administrative Provisions. Article 15. The High Contracting Parties shall take all necessary legislative or other measures in order to give effect within their territories to the provisions of this Convention. The High Contracting Parties shall, if they have not already done so, create a special administration for the purpose of: {a) Applying the provisions of the present Convention; {b) Regulating, supervising and controlling the trade in the drugs; (c) Organising the campaign against drug addiction, by taking all useful steps to prevent its development and to suppress the illicit traffic.Article 16. 1.

No High C ontracting Party shall allow the accumulation in the possession of any manufacturer of quantities of raw materials in excess of those required for the economic conduct of business, having regard to the prevailing market conditions. The amounts of raw material in the possession of any manufacturer at any one time shall not exceed the amounts required by that manufacturer for manufacture during the ensuing six months, unless the Government, after due investigation, considers that exceptional conditions warrant the accumulation of additional amounts, but in no case shall the total quantities which may be accumulated exceed one year's supply. Article ly. Each High Contracting Party shall require each manufacturer within his territories to submit quarterly reports stating: [a) The amount of raw materials and of each of the drugs received into the factory by such manufacturer and the quantities of the drugs, or any other products whatever, produced from each of these substances. In reporting the amounts of raw materials so received, the manufacturer shall state the proportion of morphine, cocaine or ecgonine contained in or producible therefrom as determined by a method prescribed by the Government and under conditions considered satisfactory by the Government; {b) Ihe quantities of either the raw material or the products manufactured therefrom which were disposed of during the quarter; (c) The quantities remaining in stock at the end of the quarter. Each High ( ontracting Party shall require each wholesaler within his territories to make at the close of each year a report stating, in respect of each of the drugs, the amount of that drug contained in preparations, exported or imported during the year, for the export or import of which authorisations are not required. Article 18. Each High Contracting Party undertakes that any of the drugs in Group I which are seized by him in the illicit traffic shall be destroyed or converted into non-narcotic substances or appropriated for medical or scientific use, either by the Government or under its control, when these are no longer required for judicial proceedings or other action on the part of the authorities of the State. In all cases diacetylmorphine shall either be destroyed or converted. Article ig. The High Contracting Parties will require that the labels under which any of the drugs, or preparations containing those drugs, are offered for sale, shall show the percentage of the drugs. These labels shall also indicate the name of the drugs as provided for in the national legislation. Chapter VII. — General Provisions. Article 20. 1. Every High Contracting Party in any of whose territories any of the drugs is being manufactured or converted, at the time when this Convention comes into force, or in which he proposes either at that time or subsequently to authorise such manufacture or conversion, shall notify the Secretary-General of the League of Nations indicating whether the manufacture or conversion is for domestic needs only or also for export, the date on which such manufacture or conversion will begin, and the drugs to be manufactured or converted, as well as the names and addresses of persons or firms authorised. 2. In the event of the manufacture or conversion of any of the drugs ceasing in the territory of any High Contracting Party, he shall notify the Secretary-General to that effect, indicating the place and date at which such manufacture or conversion has ceased or will cease and specifying the drugs affected, as well as the names and addresses of persons or firms concerned. 3.

The High Contracting Parties will communicate to each other, through the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, as soon as possible, particulars of each case of illicit traffic discovered by them which may be of importance either because of the quantities involved or because of the light thrown on the sources from which drugs are obtained for the illicit traffic or the methods employed by illicit traffickers. The particulars given shall indicate as far as possible: [a] The kind and quantity of drugs involved ; [h) The origin of the drugs, their marks and labels; (c) The points at which the drugs were diverted into the illicit traffic; (d) The place from which the drugs were despatched, and the names of shipping or forwarding agents or consignors; the methods of consignment and the name and address of consignees, if known ; (e) The methods and routes used by smugglers and names of ships, if any, in which the drugs have been shipped; (/) The action taken by the Government in regard to the persons involved, particularly those possessing authorisations or licences and the penalties imposed.

Article 25. If there should arise between the High Contracting Parties a dispute of any kind relating to the interpretation or application of the present Convention and if such dispute cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, it shall be settled in accordance with any applicable agreements in force between the Parties providing for the settlement of international disputes. In case there is no such agreement in force between the Parties, the dispute shall be referred to arbitration or judicial settlement. In the absence of agreement on the choice of another tribunal, the dispute shall, at the request of any one of the Parties, be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, if all the Parties to the dispute are Parties to the Protocol of December 16th, 1920, relating to the Statute of that Court, and, if any of the parties to the dispute is not a party to the Protocol of December 16th, 1920, to an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 18th, 1907, for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes.

ALLEMAGNE GERMANY Freiherr von Rheinbaben fiTATS-UNIS D'AMfiRIQUE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA John K. Caldwell Harry J. Anslinger Walter Lewis Treadway Sanborn Young (1) The Government of the United States of America reserves the right to impose, for purpose of internal control and control of import into and export from territory under its jurisdiction, of opium, coca leaves, all of their derivatives and similar substances produced by synthetic process, measures stricter than the provisions of the Convention. (2) The Government of the United States of America reserves the right to impose, for purposes of controlling transit through its territories of raw opium, coca leaves, all of their derivatives and similar substances produced by synthetic process, measures by which the production of an import permit issued by the country of destination may be made a condition precedent to the granting of permission for transit through its territory. (3) The Government of the United States of America finds it impracticable to undertake to send statistics of import and export to the Permanent Central Opium Board short of sixty days after the close of .the three-months period to which such statistics refer. (4) The Government of the United States of America finds it impracticable to undertake to state separately amounts of drugs purchased or imported for Government purposes. (5) Plenipotentiaries of the United States of America formally declare that the signing of the Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs by them on the part of the United States of America on this date is not to be construed to mean that the Government of the United States of America recognises a regime or entity which signs or accedes to the Convention as the Government of a country when that regime or entity is not recognised by the Government of the United States of America as the Government of that country. (6) The plenipotentiaries of the United States of America further declare that the participation of the United States of America in the Convention for limiting the Manufacture of and regulating the Distribution of Narcotics Drugs, signed on this date, does not involve any contractual obligation on the part of the United States of America to a country represented by a regime or entity which the Government of the United States of America does not recognise as the Government of that country until such country has a Government recognised by the Government of the United States of America. 1 J.

Duncan Hall , Secretary: M. Bertil A. Renborg, Assistant Secretary; and M. P. Barandon , Legal Adviser to the Conference.In the course of a series of meetings between May 27th and July 13th, 1931, the instruments hereinafter enumerated were drav/n up: 1. Convention limiting the Manufacture and regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Dnus; II. Protocol of Signature of the Convention. 1 he C onference also adopted the following recommendations: L The Conference: Recalling the proposal made by the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs in the Model Code for the Administrative Control of the Drug Traffic, 1 which was drawn up at its eleventh session to the effect that, in countries the administrative organisation of which allows of such a procedure, the supervision of the trade in narcotics as a whole should be in the hands of a single authority, so that all supervisory measures over this trade may be unified; and that, in countries where this supervision is in the hands of several authorities, steps should be taken to establish co-ordination among them: Recommends that such Members of the League of Nations and non-member States as do not at present possess such a single authority should forthwith consider the desirability of establishing one, with the duty of regulating, supervising and controlling the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs and of preventing and combating drug addiction and the illicit traffic; and that they should report to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations within a period of one year from the present date on the results of their examination of this question. n. The Conference: Recognising that the Model Code above referred to has been of considerable value to a number of Governments as a guide in the framing of legislation and administrative measures for the application of the Geneva Convention in their territories: Recommends that a similar Code should be drawn up before the entry into force of the Con vention signed this day, and should be circulated to Governments with a request that they should be guided as far as possible by the Code in framing the necessary legislative and adminis trative measures for the application in their territories of the said Convention; Requests the Council of the League of Nations to ask the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs to prepare such a Code. III. The Conference: Having decided, in accordance with the advice of the Experts attached to the Conference, to include among the drugs which should be subject to the full provisions of this Convention and of the Geneva Convention (Group I) certain drugs not at present brought under the Geneva Convention and the Hague Convention of 1912: Recommends : (1) That the Council of the League of Nations should request the Health Committee of the League to consider forthwith the desirability of bringing these drugs under the Geneva Convention, in accordance with the procedure of Article 10 of that Convention ; (2) That the Council should call the attention of Governments of countries to which the Hague Convention applies, but to which the Geneva Convention does not apply, to the proposal in this Convention and to the report of the Experts, with reference to the provisions of Article 14 {d) of the Hague Convention. IV. The Conference: Recommends that Governments should consider the desirability of establishing a State monopoly over the trade in, and, if necessary, over the manufacture of, the drugs covered by the Convention signed on this day's date. [The German delegation stated that it could not accept this recommendation.] V. The Conference: Considering that, in order to combat more efficiently the smuggling and abuse of the substances covered by the Convention of this day's date, it is necessary by means of an international agreement 1 Document 0.241 .1928. XT, Annex VIII.to supplement the penalties provided for in Article 20 of the Hague Convention of 1912 and in Article 28 of the Geneva Convention; ( onsidering that the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs has been presented by the International Criminal Police Commission with a draft international convention for the suppression of the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs the main features of which are based on the Convention of April 20th, 1929, against Counterfeit Currency; hxpresses the wish that, on the basis of the work undertaken by the Advisory Committee, a ( onvention may be concluded with the least possible delay for the prosecution and punishment of breaches of the law relating to the manufacture of, trade in, and possession of, narcotic drugs; And requests the Council to draw the attention of Governments to the importance of such a Convention, in order to hasten the meeting of a Conference to conclude a convention on this question. VI. The Conference: Recognising the highly dangerous character of diacetylmorphine as a drug of addiction and the possibility in most, if not all, cases of replacing it by other drugs of a less dangerous character; Recommends that each Government should examine in conjunction with the medical profession the possibility of abolishing or restricting its use, and should communicate the results of such examination to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. VIL The Conference: Recommends that the Governments should study the possibility of applying the system of international control provided in the Geneva Convention to every preparation containing any of the drugs included in Group I, whatever the drug content of the preparation. The Conference further recommends that the Council of the League of Nations should invite the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs to examine the question. [The German delegation stated that it could not accept these recommendations.] VIII. The Conference: Recommends that, in order to facilitate the application of the measures directed against drug addiction and the illicit traffic, Governments should consider the possibility of excluding from the benefits of most-favoured-nation clauses in future commercial treaties and agreements the substances to which the Geneva Convention and this Convention apply. [The delegations of Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Siam, Sweden and Switzerland stated that they could not accept this recommendation.] IX. The Conference: Considering that, subject to possible fluctuations in world requirements for medical and scientific purposes, the amounts of morphine, diacetylmorphine and cocaine manufactured for use as such during the period prior to the coming into force of the Convention signed to-day should not exceed the average amount of the total world needs, based on the average medical and scientific requirements of the individual countries and that the studies made by the Secretariat of the League of Nations in documents of the Conference (documents L.F.S.3( i)— Parts I, II and III, 8, 61 and 65) for the years 1928, 1929 and 1930 have resulted in an estimate of the total present world requirements of these drugs for use as such which is approximately as follows: Tons Morphine 9 Diacetylmorphine 2 Cocaine 514 Requests the Council of the League of Nations to instruct the Secretary-General to draw the attention of the Members of the League and the States non-members to these documents and to the present resolution; and Recommends that, pending the entry into force of the Convention signed to-day, the countries manufacturing these drugs shall limit the manufacture of these drugs for use as such as nearly as possible to the quantities required for domestic consumption, and export for medical and scientific purposes. X. The Conference: Recommends that the League of Nations be enabled to give prizes as a reward for results obtained by research work for the purpose of discovering medicines which, although producing the same therapeutic effects as the drugs, do not give rise to drug addiction.- 33 En foi de quoi les delegues ont signe le present Acte.

IN REPLY: 0.0.P./0.L.2. 1976 OHNBVA, October 14th, 1937. / Jit Sir, The Permanent Central Opium Board has noted that the national authorities often issue import certificates for larger quantities of the drugs covered by the Convention for limiting the Manufacture and regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs, signed at Geneva, on July 13th, 1951, than are permissible under the estimate system. When the importa tion of these excess quantities is reported as having been effected, the Board is compelled to apply the procedure laid down in Article 14 of the Convention. To avoid the great inconvenience which this action inevitably causes to all concerned, the Permanent Central Opium Board asks the competent authorities not to issue import certificates without first making sure that the estimates will not be exceeded if the quantities covered by these certifi cates are actually imported during the year. If the national authorities discover at any time during the year that the requirements of their country will exceed the quantities previously estimated for, a supplemen tary estimate and a statement giving the reasons for the The British Political Agent in the Bahrain Islands, MANAMA. Bahrain Islands.- B - additional requirements should be sent to the Board before an import certificate is issued for the quantities required in excess of the previous estimates. (See the 1931 Convention, Article 14, paragraph 8(1)). It is strongly recommended that, at the end of each quarter when they have prepared the quarterly statistics of imports and exports for transmission to the Board in accord ance with Article 22 of the Geneva Convention of 1925, the national authorities should examine the position as Indicated by the import figures (leas the export figures) for the year up to the end of that quarter and see whether the limits fixed by their estimates (as embodied in the 'Statement' for the year issued by the Supervisory Body) have already been reached or are likely to be reached in the near future. And they are asked, if that is found to be the case, to consider whether a supplementary estimate will be required or not to meet the needs of the country during the remainder of the year. Such an examination is particularly important at the end of the third quarter of each year. If this practice is adopted generally, supplementary estimates will reach the Supervisory Body in ample time to be considered and communica ted to other Governments during the course of the year to which they relate; and the difficulties which have arisen in previous years when supplementary estimates have been sent in at the close, or even after the close, of the year to which they relate will be avoided. The Supervisory Body has not been able to deal with such estimates, nor can the Permanent Central Opium Board take them into account in reporting on any excesses of imports over estimates that may occur.-/ A - 5 - The speoial attention of jour Government is Invited to this proposal (which was put forward in the Supervisory Body's 'Statement' for 1937) at the present time, as the import and export figures for the first three quarters of the current year will shortly be in the hands of the national authorities, and the Central Board would ask that, in the event of a supplementary estimate 'being found necessary for the current year, it may be furnished as early as possible, and if necessary by cable, so as to reach Geneva at latest by Dtoember let, 1957, I much regret that circumstances have prevented my sending out this letter earlier* I have the honour to be.

Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by $ proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention of February 19th, 1925), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other. TABLE OF EQUIVALENCES.

Import -and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other. TABLE OF EQUIVALENCES.

Note 4. By imports 'for Government purposes ' is to be understood substances imported for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country, or to meet exceptional circumstances. Substances imported by the Government for normal domestic consumption by the civilian population, whether the substances are to be sold or to be distributed gratuitously by the Government, should not be considered as imports for Government purposes. Note 5. STATISTICS SHOULD BE BASED ON ACTUAL MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE FRONTIER AND NOT MERELY UPON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT AUTHORISATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ISSUED. 'Imported from ': Give the country which exported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the export authorisation according to Article 13 of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such authorisation has been issued, the exporting country is the country from which the goods were actually despatched to the importing country. 'Exported to': Give the country which imported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the import certificate according to Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such certificate has been issued, the importing country is the country to which the goods were actually despatched. Import and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention), the country through which it'passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other. TABLE OF EQUIVALENCES.

We quite agree that in the paet certain considerations have led His Majesty's Government to abstain fron publicly giving undue emphasis to their views on the political status of Bahrein. We do not, however, feel that these considerations still apply in the way as formerly. In particular, as regards the possibility of embarrassing criticism from Persia our views are as set out in Renders letter E. 2463/2463/91 of 22nd May, 1936, to Walton in connexion with the question ol the status ox the xmcial Sheikhdoms, and of Bahrein and Koweit, for the purposes of s. 21 of the Import Duties Act, 1932. In brief, we are prepared to face a possible Persian protest in thiB connexion with equanimity. 3. With regard to the attitude of such other countries as are ready at the present time to seize any stick with which rv to beat His Majesty's Government, we admit that they may try to misrepresent the position, but we feel v/e must be prepared to face their possible criticism on this issue, Bahrein is a British Protected State for \Vhich it has been decided His Majesty's Government must admit ultimate international responsibility. e therefore feel that the territory should appropriately appear in the annual Statement issued by the Permanent Central Opium Board among the Dependencies, Protectorates, Colonies etc., of Great Britain. 4.

Ixt'a April, 1938. a Dear Sir Malcolm, I am sorry that it has taken so long to furnish a reply to your letter of the 28th October, to Tomkins regarding the submission of estimateb for Bahrain under the Drug Limitation Convention of 1931. We agree- that, since exports to Bahrain are being reported to the Central Opium Board, the inclusion of estimates for Bahrain in the Annual btatement issued by the Supervisory Body cannot be avoided. As Turner said in hit letter of 25th May x. 1936, Bahrain cannot be treated as part of India for this purpos A nor do we think it can be included in any other country^ estimates. A separate entry is therefore necessary, and on the vihole we think that Bahrain might be shown in the list among British Dependencies, Protectorates, Colonies, etc. The Foreign Office concur. As regards your further point, it is true that the action of the Central Opium Board in sending forms to the Political Agent was not consistent with the procedure indicated in Turner 1 1 letter, but since it was the British representative and not the Ruler or the local Government that was addressed we think that the position is sufficiently safeguarded and that Vve need raise no objection to the procedure adopted on that occasion by the Central Board. As a result, however, of the inclusion of Bahrain in the list of British Dependencies etc. it would no longer be appropriate for the Board to apply direct to any authority in Bahrain for a statement of estimated drug requirements. They ought instead to apply to the Home Office who ^ould furnish the estimate to the Board after obtaining the necessary particulars through the India Office. ^ir Malcolm Delevingne AcA. Kjt ]/o .

If no intimates appear in the Annual Statement issued by the Supervisory Body, while at the same time exports to Bahrein are being reported to the Central Board by Great Britain, the position is a bit lrrer:ular. At the time of correspondence in 1935-36 Bahrein was not a arty to the Convention of 1931, and I suppose is still in that position. Bahrein is under no obligation, therefore, to furnish estimates Itself; but if estimates are not furnished the Supervisory Body is » required as far as possible to make them - unless Bahrein can be regarded as included in the Kstimates for some other country appearingAdresse t^l^graphique; CENTRALBOARD NATIONS GENEVE COMITE CENTRAL PERMANE DE L'OPIUM, SOCIETE DES NATIONS GENEVE.

Article 2 of the Convention reads as follows : n l.

'2.

Note 4. By imports 'for Government purposes ' is to be understood substances imported for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country, or to meet exceptional circumstances. Substances imported by the Government for normal domestic consumption by the civilian population, whether the substances are to be sold or to be distributed gratuitously by the Government, should not be considered as imports for Government purposes. Note 5. STATISTICS SHOULD BE BASED ON ACTUAL MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE FRONTIER AND NOT MERELY UPON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT AUTHORISATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ISSUED. ' Imported from ': Give the country which exported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the export authorisation according to Article 13 of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such authorisation has been issued, the exporting country is the country from which the goods were actually despatched to the importing country. 'Exported to ': Give the country which imported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the import certificate according to Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such certificate has been issued, the importing country is the country to which the goods were actually despatched. Import and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country . shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other.

Note 6. In order to secure a uniform basis for the preparation of estimates and statistics, it is recommended that Governments should adopt the following interpretation of the terms ' reserve stocks ' and ' Government stocks '. The term ' reserve stocks ' should be taken to mean the normal working stocks maintained by manufacturers and wholesalers for the normal domestic consumption of the country, for conversion in the country, and for export. The effect of this interpretation will be that, in making estimates and in compiling statistics of reserve stocks. Governments will not take into account stocks in the hands of retailers. 'Government stocks' should, as far as possible, be regarded as including only stocks under Government control for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country or to meet exceptional circumstances. Any stocks of drugs held by the Government for normal domestic consumption in the country by the civilian population, whether such drugs are sold by the Government or distributed gratuitously, should, for the purpose of the estimates and the statistics furnished to the Permanent Central Board, be included in the ' reserve stocksNo. 1068-8 /4 • Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th July 1938• To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain.

Note 4. By imports 'for Government purposes ' is to be understood substances imported for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country, or to meet exceptional circumstances. Substances imported by the Government for normal domestic consumption by the civilian population, whether the substances are to be sold or to be distributed gratuitously by the Government, should not be considered as imports for Government purposes. Note 5. STATISTICS SHOULD BE BASED ON ACTUAL MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE FRONTIER AND NOT MERELY UPON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT AUTHORISATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ISSUED. 'Imporie^ from ': Qive the country which exported the goods and whose competent a-uthorities have issued the export authorisation according to Article 13 of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such authorisation has been issued, the exporting country is the country from which the goods were actually despatched to the imposing country. . . 'Exported to': Give the country which imported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the import certificate according to Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such certificate has been issued, the importing country is the country to which the goods were actually despatched. Import and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other. TABLE OF EQUIVALENCES.

I'ne most lively explanation tnat occurs to me is tnat tne signed form represents tne requirements of tne Mission nospital only, and tne otner tne requirements of tne Government Medical service (if tnere is one), or tne political agency's doctor {it tnere is one; or some private practitioner. If so, tne totaj/estimates would be tne sum of tne quantities in tne two j?'orms.

Note 4. By medical needs are to be understood all requirements for medical purposes, including dental and veterinary requirements. Note 5. The preparations for the export of which export authorisations are not required are: (1) preparations containing any of the drugs which have been exempted under Article 8 of the Convention of February 19th, 1925; (2) preparations containing 0.2 per cent or less of morphine or 0.1 per cent or less of cocaine, but not the solutions or dilutions in an inert substance (see Article 13, i (b), of the Convention of July 13th, 1931); (3) preparations containing any of the drugs in group II (codeine and dionine) which are adapted to a normal therapeutic use (see Article 13, 2, of the Convention of July 13th, 1931). Note 6. In order to secure a uniform basis for the preparation of estimates and statistics, it is recommended that Governments should adopt the following interpretation of the terms 'reserve stocks ' and ' Government stocks '. The term ' reserve stocks ' should be taken to mean the normal working stocks maintained by manufacturers and wholesalers for the normal domestic consumption of the country, for conversion in the country, and for export. The effect of this interpretation will be that, in making estimates and in compiling statistics of reserve stocks, Governments will not take into account stocks in the hands of retailers. 'Government stocks' should, as far as possible, be regarded as including only stocks under Government control for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country or to meet exceptional circumstances. Any stocks of drugs held by the Government for normal domestic consumption in the country by the civilian population, whether such drugs are sold by the Government or distributed gratuitously, should, for the purpose of the estimates and the statistics furnished to the Permanent Central Board, be included in the ' reserve stocks '. i '.r; as ra I: -I .

Note 4. By imports 'for Government purposes ' is to be understood substances imported for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country, or to meet exceptional circumstances. Substances imported by the Government for normal domestic consumption by the civilian population, whether the substances are to be sold or to be distributed gratuitously by the Government, should not be considered as imports for Government purposes. Note 5. STATISTICS SHOULD BE BASED ON ACTUAL MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE FRONTIER AND NOT MERELY UPON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT AUTHORISATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ISSUED. 'Imported from ': Give the country which exported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the export authorisation according to Article 13 of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such authorisation has been issued, the exporting country is the country from which the goods were actually despatched to the importing country. 'Exported to': Give the country which imported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the import certificate according to Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such certificate has been issued, the importing country is the country to which the goods were actually despatched. Import and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by tfife one country and as imports by the other. TABLE OF EQUIVALENCES.
