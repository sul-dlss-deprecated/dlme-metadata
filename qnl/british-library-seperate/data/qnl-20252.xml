It notes that Humood ben Mahomed has been deputed to the Resident to express their views.Mahomed ben Khuleef [Muḥammed bin Khalīfah Āl Khalīfah] and Ali ben Khuleef have sought permission from the Resident for the 'indiscriminate seizure' of the boats of their opponents, and to be able to station war vessels in the pearl banks; it is noted that the Resident has overruled this request as in his view their 'opponents' have not abused their present asylum. Instead, the Resident explains that he has advocated they adopt a conciliatory policy to ensure their safety. It further explains that while their concerns are not without foundation, their proposals were more likely to cause a rupture with the Wahabee Chief than to prevent it.The letter explains the Resident's view that the 'most natural' solution would be to arrange for the sons of the Ex-Chief of Bahrein to be moved further into the interior, but notes that this cannot be achieved through British influence. It further notes that as they are residing within the territory of the Wahabee Chief, and are under his protection, it would be difficult to undertake operations against one, but not the other.The item has four enclosures:1. Translated extract of a letter from Shaikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa, Chief of Bahrein to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 16 July 1853.The enclosure states that his views have been made known to his brother Humood ben Mahomed al Fazil, so that they may be represented to the Resident.2. Translation of a letter from Shaikh Ali ben Khuleefa, brother to the Chief of Bahrein to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 16 July 1853.The enclosure is confirming that hostilities have been contemplated against the 'those residing on the island of Ges', as the parties in question intend on moving to Kuteef [Al-Qaṭīf]; it claims that in the event they attempt to re-settle on the Arabian Coast, that hostilities can be commenced without a declaration of war.It further claims that the Resident's explanation of the difference between partisan and declared war is unclear; they have therefore deputed Shaikh Humood ben Mahomed al Fazil to ascertain his views.3. Translation of a letter from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Shaikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa, dated 26 July 1853.The enclosure outlines the views presented by the Resident in his discussions with the Chief's brother, Shaikh Humood ben Mahomed al Fazil, with respect to the supposed designs of his enemies against Bahrein.4. Letter Office No. 216 of 1853 from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to Commodore George Robinson, Commander of the Indian Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf, dated 19 July 1853.The enclosure is informing the Commodore that the Resident has received intelligence indicating that two armed boats have put to sea from Bahrein; their stated purpose being to intercept boats conveying members of the Al Ali tribe between Kenn and Demaun [Ad-Dammān].It explains that the Resident fears that the vessels will use the opportunity to seize other boats from the same tribe. It therefore suggests that the Commodore undertakes a cruise of the pearl banks when he departs Bushire, though it instructs him not to interfere with the Bahrein boats so long as they stick to their stated goals.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x00001a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
