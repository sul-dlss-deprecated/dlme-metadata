As stated at this meeting, the Company is presently engaged in certain important matters with the Iranian Government, and we are therefore most anxious that these should be in no way disturbed by attention being drawn to the operation of our Wireless Station at Abadan, the installation and use of which, as I explained, has the full knowledge and approval of the Iranian Government. 5 . We know, however, from past experience, how extremely delicate is this question of the use of tireless in Iran, and we are consequently nervous lest any enquiry of this nature might lead the Iranian Government to re-open the whole subject in which we imagine the Residency Wireless at Bushire would also evoke special attention. 4. We agree of course that the Government of India cannot be expected to accept any responsibility for a Wireless Station of this nature situated on Iranian territory, and we appreciate that they will be anxious to regularize the position as soon as possible. Our proposal is, therefore, to approach the .Iranian Government at the first favourable opportunity, and to inform them that it is necessary for us to be allotted an Iranian call sign. 5 . We should inform you before making any such approach to the Iranian Government so that the Government of India could, if they so wished, inform Berne, in responseto their enquiry, that the call sign V.T.I., previously allotted to Abadan, was now being withdrawn and that the tireless Station at that place did not in any way come under their jurisdiction. We trust that you will approve this line of action. Yours sincerely A.C.B. Symon £*sq., India House, Whitehall, S.W.l.Note oi Conversation at Britannic House on September 23rd s 1937. Mr. Morlcy and l went to see Mr. Elkington and other Oxiicials ox the Anglo Iranian Oil Company on September 23rd. The object was to discuss the Government of India’s enquiry about the Company's wireless stations at Abadan and Meidan-i-Nattun. 2. it was explained to the Company that the Government of India had received an enquiry from the International folucommunicat ions Bureau at Berne about the wireless station at Abadan. The Bureau had apparently received an enquiry xrom some shipping company, one of whose vessels had drawn a t tenoion to the existence of the station. The Government of India had enquired whether, as this station and that at Maidan-i-Baftun are situated m Iranian territory, it is any longer necessary or desirable that they should use Indian calx signs. lx, however, the Indian call signs are to be retained, the Government of India would like full particulars about the conditions on which the stations work, and the necessary cecnnical particulars about frequencies, etc., since they are technically responsible vis-a-vis of the International Telecommunications Bureau, for any stations with Indian call signs. 3. The Company's representatives explained that the station &amp; dt Maidan—i-Naxtun is i q n fpurely local use. The Abadan station, on the other hand, is used for communication with the Company's ships at sea. it is. hov/ever, used solely for the purposes of the Company's operations/2 . operations &gt; and v/ith the lull knowledge anc: consent of the Iranian Government. 4. they gave the history of the stations, namely, that they were set up during the War for the Company; that it was intended that aftor the war they should be run by r.li.l.D. on behalf of the company; that the original stations were .demolished, and fresh stations were later constructed by the A.P.O.C. entirely at their own expense; tiui,t che Suasions are now entirely in the Company's hands; but that the Indian call signs have boon retained throughout, They said that the Company had no objection to the Indian call signs continuing to bo retained (provided, of course, there was no question of any licence fees or the like being- paid to the Government of India) and they could easily produce the necessary particulars which would enable the Gov^rnmenc o^ India to reply to the enquiry from the Berne Bureau. 5. .'/e suggested, however, that if the Government of India replied to the Bureau and the Bureau circulated the particulars received from the Government of India to the adherents of the T-lecommunications Convention, the Iranian Government's attention would be drawn to the matter, and th^-y flight very probably raise objections to the Government oi maia exercising international responsibility in respect oi the Company's wireless stations operated m Iranian tuintory in connection v/ith the concession held by the Company from the Iranian Government. in the light of the discussion, Mr. Blkington suggested that the best plan would be for the Government oi India to reply to the communication from Borne, saying that the Indian call signs had been allocated to both those stations/£. / 3 . stations a long time ago* th.ac the Govornmcnc Oo. India had at ono time had some responsibility in connection with them, but that in the pr esent circumstances they had no responsibility whatever, nor wore they in a position to give the necessary technical information. They would accordingly suggest, with the concurrence of the Company, that the Indian call signs in respect of both stations should be removed from the international list forthwith. 6, It was explained that in regard to the Maidan-i- Kaftun station it would be unnecessary to tahe any further steps, as this station is used only for local work, and is not m the least likely to come to international notice. As regards the Ab-adan station, it is important for the fa (k IrMtAAJLKA Company to continue to operate this' aa-aaf .jar uoentr and if the Government of India adopt the attitude suggested above it will be open to the Company, either to approach the Berne Bureau themselves, with a request for international recognition of the station, or to ask the Iranian Government to make the necessary arrangements. 7. Mr. Morley and 1 agreed that p rima facie this course of action would be the best in all the circumstances, and would be the least likely to involve complications between the Government of India or H.M.G. and the Iranian Government.

Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's wireless stations at Abadan and Mai dan-i -Naf tun are still using the Indian call-sigis which were allotted to them in 1923 and 1915 respectively. These stations are accordingly treated as under Indian control and the British Post Office, London, have now forwarded to the Director Greneral, Posts and Telegraphs, for disposal an enquiry received from.the International Telecomnuni- cations Bureau, Berne, about the wireless station at Abadan. A copy of the communication received from the British Post Office is enclosed. 2. I am to enquire whether, as the stations are situated in Iranian territory, it is any longer necessary or desirable that these stations should use Indian call-signs.... * m6000 ihwaz, suggests that the Company have other wireless stations which do not use Indian call-signs and possibly they have been allotted call-signs by the Iranian autho rities* If this is the case, it would perhaps be more appropriate if these two stations are also allotted call-signs from the Iranian series. 3. I am therefore to request that if the Secretary of State sees no objection the Company should be consulted on this point* If they wish to retain the Indian call- signs for the two stations, there will be no objection from the technics! point of view provided we are clearly informed of the conditions on which the stations sire to be worked. It will be for consideration whether the stations should be notified in the International lists. 4. As the Director General, Posts and Telegraphs will have to send a reply to the International Tele- conmunications Bureau, it is requested that the infor mation required by the ladiomarine Corporation of America may be obtained from the Company and forwarded to the Government of India for onward transmission.
