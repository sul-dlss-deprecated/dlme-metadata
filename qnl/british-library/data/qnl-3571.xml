Winter tour of 2. At the request of Lieutenant-Colonel H. A. K. Gough, CJ.E., His Britan- Mulk QaWam Ul ’ Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, and of the Qawam-ul-Mulk, I proceeded on 25th November 1917 from Shiraz to Kharameh by motor, with Lieutenant-Colonel Gough. We remained at Kharameh on 26th November, and returned to Shiraz on 27th November. Abadeh tour. road Lieutenant-Colonel Gough discussed various political problems with the Qa- wam-u'l-Mulk, and I arranged to provide a detachment South Persia Rifles, under Captain Butters, South Persia Rifles, to accompany the Qawam-ul-Mulk in his winter tour to the garmsir of his Arab tribes. This detachment consisted of one troop, 2nd Cavalry, South Persia Rifles and one company, 4th Infantry, South Persia Rifles from Shiraz. Some of the Arab kalantars were somewhat recalci trant, and the Qawam was of opinion that the Soulat was intriguing among the Arab tribes, to create disturbances and to undermine the Qawam’s position. T he provision of these South Persia Rifles troops was considered by me to be desirable, partly to strengthen the position of the Qawam, and partly as an out ward and visible sign that the Qawam was working in co-operation with the British. 3. Lieutenant-Colonel V. P. B. Williams having taken over command of the Pars Brigade, the opportunity was convenient to put right the dispositions and ad ministrations arrangements along the Shiraz-Isfahan road. Under the Swedish gendarmerie regime, the protection of roads was mainly carried out by a large number of small posts scattered along the whole length of the road. Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter, when Officer Commanding, Pars Brigade, obstructed any efforts to amend this pernicious system. On 29th November 1917, I left Shiraz with Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, and the following tour was done by motor car November 29th Shiraz to Saadatabad .. ., 73 miles. November 30th ..

The following arrangements were put into force :— (i) A number of unnecessary posts of tufangchis were abolished, and others reduced. /The pay of certain headmen of tufangchis, and their responsibilities, were increased. It was explained to these headmen that their primary duty was to act as intelligence agents, to report at once to the nearest South Persia Rifles garrison the. presence and movements of bands of raiders.

(b) One squadron 3rd Cavalry, South Persia Rifles, was concentrated in the well-built caravanserai at Qavvamabad. The Head Quarters of the 3rd Cavalry is at Abadeh, and Lieutenant-Colonel Hunter used to keep detachments of the 3rd Cavalry all down the road, at Shiraz, and partly along the road to Khaneh Zinian. Altogether 130 of the 3rd Cavalry were collected at Qavvamabad from small posts, under Captain Hill, South Persia Rifles, and two Bri tish cavalry instructors, South Persia Rifles. The majority of these men were ex-gendarmes of the Swedish regime, many with 5 or 6 years service. One-third of them were non-commissioned officers, having been given rank by the Swedes, or by Lieutenant- Colonel Hunter, for small posts. I inspected these at Qavvam abad. A more villainous-looking lot of men, and more unpromis ing material, I have seldom come across. Captain Hill was told to weed them out as quickly as possible, and to do his best with the remainder, to give them a chance. Forty were discharged during December 1917. After Captain Hill’s experiences with the remainder of these 90 ex-gen- darmes, during January 1918,1 gave orders for the discharge of the whole lot, for cowardice and indiscipline, and as not being worth the pay they drew. The horses, equipment, rifles, clothing, etc., were all sent to Abadeh, where a new squadron 3rd Cavalry is being formed. One squadron 2nd cavalry, South Persia Rifles, from Shiraz proceeded to Qavvamabad in February 1918. .(c) The winter garrison of Dehbid was fixed at one platoon South Persia Rifles Infantry and one troop South Persia Rifles Cavalry (from Abadeh). Note. —In March 1918 the garrison of Dehbid was taken over by South Persia Rifles detachments from Shiraz, and the whole of the 3rd Cavalry and 3rd Infantry were concentrated at Abadeh. {d) In view of developments .northwards, the bulk of the 3rd Cavalry South Persia Rifles (about 2 squadrons) was concentrated at Aba deh for training and musketry. Several small posts of cavalry near Abadeh were withdrawn to Abadeh. The bulk o v f the 3rd Infantry South Persia Rifles (about 2| companies) was concentrated at Abadeh. One platoon South Persia Rifles infantry was allotted to Yezd-i-Khast, with a detached guard at Shulgistan and at Aminabad. (in) The accounts of the Abadeh outpost, about one year in arrears were gone into by Officer Commanding Fars Brigade, and taken to Shiraz, for incorporation into the Fars Brigade accounts. (iv) The rationing arrangements at Abadeh have hitherto not been satis factory. The South Persia Rifles men had been receiving a money allowance in lieu of rations. 1 detailed Captain Temple, South Persia Rifles, attached Supply and Trans port Corps, as Supply Officer for Abadeh. This wms done so that he &gt; should be available to move from Abadeh with any column it might be found necessary to send northwards.4 Arrangements were made with Officer Commanding, Abadeh, and the local revenue official and the Abadeh headman, to enable wheat, barley and bhoosa to be purchased for issue as rations. Officer Command-' ing Fars Brigade, also completed arrangements for regimental cooking pots, kitchens, and bakeries, and the enlistment of the ancillary ser vices personnel (special enlistments, cooks, bakers, etc.) as laid down in South Persia Rifles regimental establishments. The difficulty in getting supplies at Abadeh had been entirely political. The Deputy Governor of Abadeh was a Qashqai, and latterly had been anti-British and anti-South Persia Rifles. On, my return to Shiraz : I consulted the British Consul, and then we made representations to* His Highness Prince Farman Farma, who promptly dismissed the Deputy Governor, and replaced him by a man who is now giving the supply officer at Abadeh every assistance. The operation of the actual Supply and Transport contracts and purchases^ at Abadeh are being dealt with by the Deputy Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, and Financial Adviser. (v) To make the garrison of Abadeh more mobile and more Self-contained for' military operations, the following mules were allotted to the Officer' , Commanding, Abadeh :— 32 mules, 1st Mule Corps, South Persia Rifles.. (This number was increased to 40 mules, in February 1918, when some 1 more were obtained at Isfahan, and similarly in March 1918 to 50 mules.) v 50 hired Persian mules, sent up from Shiraz.. Khaneh Zinian 4. Subadar-Major Mehr Din, 1st Sappers and Miners, with his Persian road roacI - g an g&gt; was instructed to complete a motor track to Khaneh Zinian. This work was completed during December 1917 and January 1918. Arrangements were made with the Deputy Assistant Director of Supply and Transport and the Officer Commanding Fars ferigade for stocks of wheat (and a proportion of flour) barley, bhoosa, wood, ammunition, etc., to be put into Khaneh Zinian caravanserai. Large jars, for water storage, have been put into the small posts at Burj-i-Taimuri and Deb Sheikh. The garrison of Khaneh Zinian was increased to one Company, 5th Infantry, South Persia Rifles, under a British Officer. Five small South Persia Rifles posts, badly sited, and unsuitable for defence,. * between Chinar Rahdar and Burj-i-Taimuri have been evacuated and dismantled. These had been built by the Swedes. These precautionary measures have been taken with a view to any operations about Khaneh Zinian against migrating tribesmen. With a good road, and a stocked advance base at Khaneh Zinian, the main difficulties of military operations in this direction, have been lessened. Zarghim-'Kina- 5. Subadar-Major Mehr Din, and his Persian road gang, left Shiraz on the reh-Sivand plain, gth February, to improve the road and build better bridges over the irrigation channels between Zarghun and Sivand. The temporary bridges, hastily built in the spring of 1917, were breaking down and unsafe for motor traffic. This work was completed early in March 1918. Organization of 6. A few minor changes in the South Persia Rifles organization have been South Persia gone into, and with the approval of the Financial Adviser, have been given effect to. These minor changes are not in the direction of increased establishments and cost, but chiefly re-arrangements, to improve mobility and efficiency. The main change is the break-up of central brigade kitchens and bakeries, a relic of the Swedish system. Cooking and rationing arrangements have been made regimental (down to squadrons and companies) with their own portable cooking pots. °A main source of immobility has thus been removed. Smith Persia 7. Various rulings and decisions of the Government of India, have recently I me accounts, been receive^. These have been gone into with the Financial Adviser, and progress'V # Clothing equipment. will now be possible, to adjust advances and accounts which have been outstanding for about 18 months. The arrears of accounts are appalling, chiefly owing to the fact that rates of pay and rates of kran exchange were not fixed. Many officers and men have already left Persia, and left the South Persia Rifles, and considerable time must elapse before accounts get up to date. The clerical establishment of accounts clerks, especially in South Persia Rifles formations, is at present short-handed, and the majority of South Persia Rifles British officers are non-regulars and unaccustomed to dealing with military accounts and to Indian regulations. Much hard work is being done with the various accounts, and it is hoped to evolve order out of the chaos of the past. 8. Deficiencies in clothing and equipment for the South Persia Rifles are being remedied as far as possible by utilizing local resources. The strain on the limited transport, especially from Bandar Abbas inland, prevents all requirements being met from India. The Supply and Transport Corps at present is represented in South Persia (excluding the base) by one regular Supply and Transport officer. Sonth Persia Rifles brigade commanders are running their own shops, tailors, bootmakers, etc., and are turning out suits of clothes, boots, belts, etc., by the hundred, to clothe and equip the South Persia Rifles. 9. (i) A telephone exchange has been put up at Shiraz, and lines put up by the South Persia Rifles school of signalling connecting with the Farman Farma, the Consulate, Force Headquarters, Headquarters Fars Brigade and the Bank. (ii) Telephone lines have been linked up, or improved, connecting Shiraz with Khaneh Zinia'n, Bajgah, Zarghun, Qavvamabad and Dehbid. (in) Materials were laid out between Shiraz and Niriz. This telephone line has now been erected under the supervision of Mr. Newton, Indo-European Telegraph Department,* and was opened to Niriz on the 22nd March 1918. The Director of Telegraphs, Indo-European Telegraph Department, has notified unofficially his willingness to take over later on the Shiraz-Ninz line at cost price. The lack of means of communicaton to Niriz has caused considerable expendi ture in hired transport, when any delay has occurred in the crossing of convoys. 10. South Persia Rifles training is continually hampered by outposts, de tachments, escorts, guards, and minor military operations. Progress is being made continuously at Brigade headquarters and at the main outposts. Musketry, field training (attack, defence, outposts, etc.) and the drilling of recruits, goes on continuously. About five hundred of the unsatisfactory ex-Swedish Gendarmerie personnel have been discharged, and replaced by younger men of a better stamp. The British instructors are doing excellent work. 11. The rank and file of the South Persia Rifles are well contented, and are gradually acquiring better discipline and confidence in their British officers and non-commissioned officer instructors. The Persian is inordinately conceited, and soon thinks he knows everything. They are, however, very intelligent and learn quickly. The Persian officers are the weak spot. Selected non-commissioned officers, I consider', form the best Persian officers for military purposes. Well-born Persians are too full of vices, and are too lazy to learn their work properly, and I doubt their capacity for serious fighting. Selected Persian officers from the north have proved more satisfactory. Considerable numbers of the old Persian officers have been summarily discharged, and replaced by promotions from the non-commissioned officers. Dismissal from the South Persia Rifles is now regarded as a severe punish ment. 12. Persia is essentially a country of filth, disease, and non-sanitation. The Medical, various nedical and sanitation arrangements required for the South Persia CS0(w)GSB and Telephone com munications. South Persia Rifles training. Moral of South Persia Rifles.6 Veterinary Object of tour. Rifles have been well looked after by the Assistant Director of Medical Services, Lieutenant-Colonel H. Burdon, C.LE. During November and December 1917, cases of cholera occurred in villages north of Kirman. Quarantine arrangements made by the South Persia Rifles prevented the infection from reaching Kirman. During December 1917 cases were reported at Kazerun suspected to be cholera. Quarantine arrangements were made by the South Persia Rifles at Dasht Arjan. During February a severe outbreak of cholera occurred in the Badeh villages, ten miles east of Shiraz. A good many cases and a few deaths, have also occurred in and around Shiraz. During February and March 1918, medical arrangements and quarantine arrange ments have beeh provided, and the epidemic has practically ceased. Turee deattrs occurred in the South Persia Rifles at Shiraz. The health of the South Persia Rifles continues to be remarkably good. The chief disease is venereal. Many of the worst cases of venereal have been dis charged from the South Persia Rifles. Considerable improvements have been effected in the South Persia Rifles lines and quarters, in the provision of washhouses and bathing arrangements, and improvements in kitchens and bakeries. Improvements and the cleaning and drainage of roads and surroundings of the lines have been carried out at Shiraz, Kirman, Bandar Abbas and all the main outposts. 13. Veterinary hospitals exist at Shiraz and Kirman. and veterinary assistants, as far as available, have been allotted to the main points on the lines of communica tions. The various arrangements have been well supervised by Major J. Harrison, A.V.C. Between November 1917 and March 1918, 39 horses and 1 mule have been destroyed for glanders at Kirman, and 18 horses and 3 mules at Shiraz. All newly purchased animals are segregated and tested for glanders. TOUR OF INSPECTOR-GENERAL, SOUTH PERSIA RIFLES. * (November 11th, 1917—March 18th, 1918). The visit of the Inspector-General to Delhi was mainly undertaken to secure support for the South Persia Rifles, in the shape of additional artillery, more person nel, and more transport; to obtain permission to commence building barracks ; to remove certain financial difficulties and, finally, to pass through the scheme of orga nization, South Persia Rifles, (15-A. Q. G.) which had been drawn up by Colonel E. F. Orton and had been despatched to India on 9th August 1917. In Persia itself the Inspector General’s tour programme included (i) Inspection of Kirman Brigade at Kirman and Saidabad ; of the 1st In fantry at Bandar Abbas and Gakum ; and of the 5th Infantry detach ment at Niriz. (ii) Inspection and examination of alternative alignments for the motor road between Bandar Abbas and Kirman. This tour has contributed greatly to a closer ‘ liaison ’ between the Headquar ters of the South Persia Rifles, Shiraz, and the Kirman Brigade and Bandar Abbas. The Inspector General has thereby obtained an intimate acquaintance both with officers and their work in these remote districts, and has been able to remove many difficulties, abuses, petty grievances, and misunderstandings, which his tour brought,, to light. 2. Tire Inspector-General and his staff officer, Lieutenant-Colonel G. P. Grant, General Staff; motored the first 360 miles of the journey as far as Hajiabad, and marched the remaining 140 miles to Bandar Abbas. Various alternative routes were examined en route. From Guhra to Bandar Abbas, a little known route \7 I'm Fin, was explored. This alignment had been recommended as a possible al ternative for the motor road, but on examination was found to be quite imprac ticable. 3. The convoy service between Bandar Abbas and Saidabad was found to be threatened with a breakdown. Government animals were worn out by constant road work ; Persian transport, even at the present high rate of hire, is unobtainable at Bandar Abbas except by impressment. This unsatisfactory state has been re medied by obtaining 1,000 good camels from Yezd on a six months' cold weather nontract for caravan work between Bandar Abbas and Saidabad. The Supply and Transport staff was found to be quite inadequate for the strain imposed. This has since been remedied {vide paragraph 5, vi.) 4. After enquiring into conditions at Bandar Abbas, the Inspector-General decided that the time had come to recommend the transference of the base, then under General Officer Commanding, Bushire, to the South Persia Rifles, with a view to its reorganisiation. Delhi was reached on December 3rd. A note was printed up and issued I)elhl ' amongst members of the Headquarters Staff, explain! ig some of the peculiar diffi culties connected with our position in Persia, and inviting the assistance of the Head quarter Staff. The first week in Delhi was occupied in preliminary visits to various Branches and Departments m order to ascertain to what extent their assistance might be counted on. The second was passed in conferences and note-writing in support of these requirements, while the third and fourth weeks were occupied in piloting these ^ demands through the various offices, and in answering questions and criticisms connected with the organization of the South Persia Rifles and their work. 5. The results obtained may be summarised as follows:— (i) Permission granted to Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, to take over Base at Bandar Abbas from General Officer Commanding Bushire. (w) Recommendation to commence building at Bandar Abbas at early date was forwarded to Secretary of State for India. This question of building, being one of policy, could not be sanctioned by the Gov ernment of India. This was sanctioned in April 1918. {Hi) New plans drawn up in Director General of Military Work’s Office for quarters at Bandar Abbas; accommodation for 12 British Officers and 12 British Non-Commissioned Officers and hospital included; a slight increase on our requirements outlined on page 92 of Colonel Orton’s scheme. This was sanctioned in April 1918. {vi) Personnel .—One British Artillery Officer for Pars Brigade and one for Kirman Brigade appointed to train 10-pr. batteries in these Brigades. One Major, Indian Infantry (Mollison) appointed to command 2nd Infantry, Kirman. One Captain, Indian Infantry (Thomas) appointed to command 1st Infantry, Bandar Abbas. One Captain, Britisfi Infantry (Taylor) appointed to command 6th Infantry, Saidabad. One Captain, Indian Cavalry (Chapman) appointed to Pars Brigade. Two Sergeants and two Corporal-instructors each, for Engineer Companies, Pars and Kirman Brigades, asked for. (Not yet appointed). Sub-Conductor, as assistant to Conductor Gypson, Base Ordnance Depot Bandar Abbas, asked for. (Not yet appointed).Clerk for F. T. C. 0., Bandar Abbas, asked for. (v) Material. —4 ten pounder guns obtained for South Persia Rifles to com plete four-gun battery, Pars and Kirman Brigades. 4 trench mortars (Stokes) and 1,000 rounds obtained to complete South Persia Rifles Artillery, in substitution for field guns, considered un suitable for South Persia. f 79 Lewis guns provided for South Persia Rifles, plus 2 for Headquarter Staff, and 8 each for 16th Rajputs and 124th Baluch Infantry; total 97 Lewis guns. 31 Hotchkiss guns for mounted units, South Persia and 4 maxims to com plete armament Machine Gun Squadrons, Pars and Kirman Brigades, have been received. 14,000 Mills bombs for Indian troops only in South Persia have also been sent from Force “ D x {vi) Transport and Supply .—100 additional bullock carts have been sent to Bandar Abbas, and are allotted to road construction duty on the southern section of the Bandar Abbas-Kirman road. A complete mechanical transport section (30 Ford Lorries) has been ordered. An Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, and 2 Deputy Assistant Directors, Supply and Transport, have been appointed in place of one Deputy Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, as before. Additional Supply and Transport personnel, in the form of a Divisional Sup ply Company and 6 Supply Depot Sections, have been sent to South Persia. (m) Water Transport.—§ light draught lighters and one seagoiny tug ob tained foi Base, Bandar Abbas making a total of 2 tuf?s‘ the tbirrl “ Vishnu ” was withdrawn for duty at Muscat. (m?)

Audit office, for South Persia Rifles accounts appointed. ff 8 ' ^ he Inspector-General’S views were consulted by the Oiief of the Genera] Staff on the sub]ect of a possible expansion of South Persia Rifles to Isfahan The! views were expressed in the form of two notes to the Chief of t he General Staff A plan of operations, worked out at Shiraz by the General Staff to meet a pos sible emergency, was passed to the General Staff Branch (M 0 1 and AT n J? favour of criticism. ‘ • 6 ) 101 Full advantage was taken of the opportunity offered to discuss with officers of the General Staff, various questions connected with the nolicv of ft,,. 7 ? p ' Rifles, and its organization Our policy with regard to tfe ipLffig of th ’ Bu^T Kazerun-Shiraz road was also obtained and approved. S * tue Kusmre- Colony 6 &lt;Sanfi 8en The^Dfrector S &lt;!f X MflRaly'Operations Lieute “ant- Colonel Grant the importance of being ready to expand th “/stTm at short eUfce “ ailt notice. Several \isits v ere paid by Lieutenant-Colonel Grant tn M O q a • t tion was freely exchanged. The appointment of Subadar-Major^p^ld^’ one3 9 Lance Naik, 106th Hazara Pioneers, was sanctioned, Subadar-Major AH Dost was questioned by officers of M. 0. 3 at Delhi. The Inspector-General constantly visited the Secretary of the Foreign Depart ment and discussed political questions relating to Southern Persia. 9. After a visit of a month, during which much interest was evinced in the South Persia Rifles, the Inspector-General, accompanied by his staff officer, reached Bandar Abbas on 19th January. The base was formally taken over by the South Persia Rifles on the following day (20th January). The duties of officers at Bandar Abbas were reallotted and an area commander, responsible for intelligence and operation including protection of working parties on the new road to Kirman, was appointed. A strong intelligence unit was formed m this area with headquarters at Bandar Abbas and with branches at Gakum and Fin During the cold weather the nomad tribes come down into the Garmsir districts bordering on the sea coast. It is this southern sectional our line ot communication that is most exposed to raids duiing the winter mon s. e new organization for intelligence aims at obtaining early information of parties gathering to raid, and at their identification. 10. A site for the new cantonment was selected^ on the high ground immediately to the north-east of the present camp at Xaiband. The purchase of two pieces of land and of a date garden, on very favourable terms, was concluded through the assistance of Mr. Howson, His Majesty s Consul. A commencement was made with the new temporary pier opposite the new site for the cantonment. 11. Transport at Bandar Abbas was organized and distributed as follows :— li) The bulk of Government Transport, including camels, mules and bullocks, was placed under Captain Charriol, assisted by Lieutenant Luther, and was allotted to road construction duties, e.g., formation of dumps and stores for working parties employed on the Bandar Abbas-Kirman road. (ii) Station Transport for work at the Base Supply Depot, consisting of a few Government animals, was^placed at the disposal of the Base Supply Officer. {iii) Convgy Transport, consisting entirely of hired Persian animals, was placed under Captains Wall and Lane, 1st Infantry, South Persia Rifles. These officers have a good knowfledge of'Persian and are responsible for the hiring 'of local transport and for settling “ charvardars ” claims. Much of this work in the past has been thrown on Mr. Hov'son, His Majesty’s Consul, and the Deputy Governor, Shuja-ul-Mulk, owing to the local Supply and Transport officer’s ignorance of the Persian language. The South Persia Rifles is deeply indebted to the untiring assistance afforded by these two officials. 12 An enquiry was held at Bandar Abbas on the attack on a South Persia Rifles caravan near Sarzeh, on the 28th December 1917, in which Indian Government camels had been carried off by Mazidi Arabs and others. The proceedings of this Court of Enquiry have been forwarded to the Chief of the General Staff. Information available pointed to the complicity of the Kalantar of Fm, Rasulla, and of the Kalantar of Rizw^an in this and other attacks on caravans. Both were arrested and after a careful enquiry had been held by British officers, the Kalantar of Fin was found guilty and shot. 13. The Qawam-ul-Mulk, who was at Darab, was invited to meet the Inspector-General at Gakum on February 12th. C80(w)GSB Bandar Abbas. &amp; Gakum,10 Routes examin ed. Bainu. ♦Bidu ? ; ' r Sir Percy Sykes explained to him that he, as Chief of the Khamseh Tribes, was held responsible for attacks by his tribesmen on British and South Persia Rifles caravans, such as had taken place at Sarzeh. 1 he Qawam undertook to do his best to recover the stolen property and to inflict punishment. The Qawam has since recovered over 100 animals, and has attacked and punished a section of the Mazidis near Jahrum. This visit of the Qawam was of considerable importance as demonstrating his adherence to the British ; it has also made it evident to the Khamseh Tribes that attacks on caravans will not be tolerated and will be punished by their own chief, as well as by the South Persia Rifles. 14. On his way to India in November 1917 the Inspector-General had given service to Ali Reza Khan, Kalantar of Gakum, and had appointed him Rais-i- tufangchi. This arrangement has already yielded good results. Ali Reza Khan and his private tufangchis have co-operated with Captain Huxley, South Persia Rifles, in command at Gakum, in attacks on robber gangs. Gakum is an important post on our line of communication and the local intel ligence system under Captain Huxley, which has been strengthened, is shaping well. 15. The Inspector-General examined alternative passes and also a new route. Of the former the Rah-i-Baluch, immediately to the east, and avoiding the Tang-i-Zagh, was found to be quite an impracticable alignment for a motor road ; it is used only by hill donkey caravans which cannot negotiate the deep pools of the Tang-i-Zagh. The Tang-i-Sadar, 8 miles west of the Tang-i-Zagh, was also inspected. It has been selected by Major Lowis as the future alignment of the motor road, which will thus avoid the dangerous Tang-i-Zagh. The constructional difficulties of the Tang-i-Sadar alignment are not great; there being no volume of flood water as in the Tang-i-Zagh. It is used a good deal by raiding parties and donkey caravans and is undoubtedly the best of the three passes. An easy, direct route between Tarum and Katru, obviating the long and diffi cult detour by Aliabad and Saidabad, was examined and is being followed by the Indian reinforcements for Shiraz. This new route passing Duragah—Sar-i-Ran-Tal Halal is seven stages shorter than the old road by Saidabad ; it crosses no high passes, has easy gradients throughout, and a good water supply at each sta^e. The section between Sar-i-Ran and Qatru was favourably reported on by Subadar- Major Ali Dost, 106th Hazara Pioneers, an officer with much experience of road construction in Persia and Baluchistan. 16. A visit was paid to Bainu,* the head-quarters of Agha Haji of Dura^ah, the most powerful man in this part of Persia. Unfortunately Agha Haji himself was absent at Furg, but his son expressed himself ready, to assist the S. P. R. Agha Haji is arranging supplies, under his own Tufangchi guards, for the passage of the Indian reinforcements in April through Sar-i-Ran. Agha Haji is credited with a force of 1,200 riflemen ; his good-will and assistance may be regarded as a distinct asset. 17. Kirman was reached by motor car from Aliabad on 18th February after considerable difficulty at the Kutal-i-Surkh. Here the track for two miles lay under snow. ^ The following S. P. R. units were inspected at Kirman 1st Cavalry, 2nd Artillery, 2nd Infantry, 2nd Machine Gun Squadron, 2nd Field Company Engineers, 2nd Mule Corps, Camel Corps, Donkey Corps ; also the Hospital and \ etermary Hospital and Supply Depot. The 6th Infantry had previously been inspected by the Inspector General at Saidabad. ' *11 Lieutenant-Colonel Farran was congratulated on the smartness of his Brigade. The ui its of this Brigade have profited by the settled conditions of the Kirman Province ; they have not been called on to find constant escorts and detachments, as has been the case with the Pars Brigade. Training has therefore progressed uninterruptedly, and the Kirman Brigade is now ready to take a larger share in the task of enforcing law and order in South Persia. The Kirman Brigade will now be charged with the protection of the new caravan route from Gakum to Katru, via Tal Halal, and has recently placed a detachment of the 6th Infantry at Katru, which will share with the detachment 1st Infantry at Gakum the duties of escorting convoys along the direct road to Shiraz. The 1st Cavalry is perhaps the smartest and most efficient unit in the South Persia Eifles. Its state reflects great credit on Captain (Local Major) Fovvle, its Commandant. The excellent system of interior economy and stable management of this unit was remarked on by the Inspector-General. An unfavourable comment ^as made on the musketry training of this unit; it was pointed out that the carbines, though admittedly obsolete and in bad order, are as good as the armament of the local tribesmen with whom the 1st Cavalry may be called on to fight. It is not proposed to indent on India for new rifles until peace is concluded. The importance of greater attention to preliminary musketry instruction, and to fire discipline and fire control was impressed on the Officer Commanding 1st Cavalry. Both 2nd and 6th Infantry battalions had made marked progress during the last year. But the men are not as well equipped or turned out as in the 1st Cavalry, Eecruits of specially good physique are being obtained from Shahr Babak. Much interest is taken by these two units in musketry, and the results obtained on the range are satisfactory and encouraging. Every Persian considers he is a born shot and it takes some little time and much instruction to remove this fallacy. The 2nd Artillery has made considerable progress during the last 12 months. It has yet, however, much to learn. The armament (two 2 5 mountain guns) and two old 7-prs. sixty years old are being shortly replaced by four 10-pr. mountain guns from India. A regular artillery officer, Captain Combes, is now in command of the artillery. I It was remarked that many of the Persian gunners were of small stature and puny physique. Special efforts are being made to obtain men of specially good physique for this arm. The Brigade Commander was advised to institute a system of Brigade recruit ing as has berni applied successfully to Fars Brigade. This should ensure a supply of men of good physique to the Mountain Artillery. The Machine Gun Squadron is suffering from a shortage of machine guns. This unit possesses at present only two in place of their full complement of six guns. Two more guns are now (April) on their way from Bandar Abbas. There has been considerable trouble with this unit owing to the dissatisfaction of many of the original enlistments, who were men of Shiraz. Persians of one province do not take to soldiering in another province of Persia, and this is an important point to remember. The horses of this unit are too old for work and must be cast before long. Many are 18 years of age and over. Kirman has now a substantial transport corps, numbering over 300 mules, 275 camels, and 500 donkeys. The camels have, generally, proved unsatisfactory transport as compared with the mules and donkeys. The South Persia Eifles donkey corps has borne the chief strain of constant caravan traffic between Saidabad and Kirman, Saidabad and Gakum, and Saidabad and Niriz, The Veterinary Officer, Kirman Brigade, Captain Pritchard, A.V.C., has greatly improved the health and efficiency of the transport, especially the donkey corps, both at Kirman and Saidabad. Special praise is due to Captain Pritchard, who has built a veterinary hospital at Kirman on modern lines. All South Persia Eifles horses and transport animals are inspected by Captain Pritchard once a week. The results of his inspeetion are apparent in the numbers of animals treated in or attending hospital. The Malein test has been applied to all South Persia Eifles horses of the Kirman Brigade.12 IS Adi. The hospital is well equipped and organized. The good work of the senior Medical Officer, Major Hance, has already been brought to the notice of Army Head-Quarters, India. Venereal disease is unfortunately still rampant, and com petent authorities consider that 80 per cent, of the total population of Kirman is diseased. Every effort is being made to reduce the prevalence of venereal disease in the Kirman Brigade. 18. At Kirman, Chief Genstaff telegram No. 17203 of 4th March 1918 was received, which pointed to the probability of Indian reinforcements being sent to Bandar Abbas in the near future. It was known that until the next harvest (July) no supplies would be available from the adjacent districts, owing to the failure of the harvest of 1917. It was also known that the collection of transport and some sup plies for the echelons of Indian troops along this route in March 1917 had taken three months. Anticipating orders from Delhi, confidential instructions were accordingly issued at once to Kirman Brigade and Bandar Abbas Area to commence collecting transport, and forming dumps on their respective sections of the road. Kirman Brigade’s task was a specially difficult one, and but for the able assistance of Mr. Wetli, the Supply Agent to kirman Brigade, the sections between Gakum and Katru could not have been stocked in time for the passage of the Indian reih- forcements from Bandar Abbas. Mr. Wetli undertook to have the supply! dumps formed in six weeks from 10th March, i.e., by the end of April 1918. 19. In order to be in a position to move a column of all arms at short notice against the robber tribes lying west of the Kavir, or salt swamp, the artillery and machine gun squadron received orders to move from Kirman to Saidabad in the near future. Kirman itself and neighbourhood is quiet. The maintenance, therefore, of a large South Persia Rifles garrison at Kirman, now that the brigade has been raised and trained, can no longer be justified. The area of the Kirman Brigade has, accordingly, been extended considerably to the west, thus relieving the Ears Brigade cf the protection of line of communications south and east of Niriz. Saidabad with a South Persia Rifles garrison of one squadron cavalry, 1 battery mountain artillery, an infantry battalion and a machine gun squadron, becomes an important strafcegetic point. It is the focus of several trade routes. The Brigade commander and his staff officer will, in future, spend a considerable part of the year at Saidabad, and thus get in closer touch with the robber tribes. Kirman, although the capital, is merely a pleasant backwater from the military point of view. *20. A visit was paid to Bam, Narmashir, from Kirman and arrangements werQ made with Sardar Mujulal, the Deputy Governor of Bam, for the South Persia Rifles to raise the Baluch Levy Camel Corps referred to on page 44 of Colonel Orton’s scheme of organization for the South Persia Rifles. The local authorities are anxious for the protection of the South Persia Rifles, and this force will serve as a link between the South Persia Rifles and the Indian troops at Dehani Baghi. Lieutenant-Colonel Farran and Mr. Skrine, His Majesty’s Consul at Kirman motored on from Bam to Dehani Baghi to report more especially on the water supply. The result of this reconnaissance has been telegraphed to the Chief of the General Staff. 21 . During the Inspector-General’s stay at Kirman a very successful military display was given by the brigade. This took the form of an attack on a mud fort constructed for the purpose. The guns shelled the towers and the machine guns opened fire from a flank, while the infantry were moving up to the assault. Finally the cavalry were brought up at a gallop. They charged and took up the pursuit of an imaginary enemy fleeing from the fort. 22. Physical training receives especial attention in the Kirman Brigade Classes representative of each unit are held in the large central gvmnasium whirh was originally the dining hall in the time of the Swedes. A good display of horsemanship and vaulting was given by the 1st Cavalry and sports, including several military events, were held during the Inspector- General’s visit. 1 23. Kirman was left by motor on 11th March, and Shiraz was reached on 18 March. Owing to heavy ram a detour of 75 miles had to be made round the nor end of the Saidabad Kavir. Here a band of 18 robbers from Chah Haq w t13 Encountered by the card. Two robbers were killed and it was ascertained after wards that three others were wounded. The band had come from Chah Haq, north-east of Niriz-. 24. The new South Persia Rifles forts, at Saidabad for a complete battalion, Ni '^ abal anfl and at Niriz for 250 infantry,, were inspected. The Saidabad fort is in occupation by . the 6th Infantry. The fort at Niriz will be ready by June 1918. 25. £he total distance traversed by the Inspector-General in Persia during this tour was 1&gt;500 miles. Owing to construction of motor roads during 1917 the Inspector-General was able to cover the entire distance, except some 300 miles, by motor car. It is hoped that by the autumn all the centres will be reached by motor cars-. G. P. GRANT, TAeut.-Colonel, - General Staff, South Persia Rifles* Shiraz * The 19th April 1918. Attack on Military Works Camp, Ah Mar, 14th December 191?. On the 14th December 1917 a band of Mazidi Arabs under one Mullah Shehin attacked Major Lowis’ camp at Ab Mar. Two horses in the camp were wounded and 3 rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition lost. A small party of the 15th Lancers on escort duty arrived in time and drove off the robbers, who had one man killed and several wounded. Action between Captain Kyle's convoy and a band of 60 “ SarhaddisP Qahrabad: The 2&amp;rd December 1917. Captain A. W. Kyle, with a small South Persia Rifles convoy, escorted by 20 men, proceeding from Shiraz to Dehbid, reached Qadrabad on the 22nd December 1917. , On the morning ot the 23rd December 1917 robbers were reported to be in the jow hills on the north side of Qadrabad. Naib II Ghulan Ali Khan, 3rd Infantry, South Persia Rifles, with 2savars and 12 infantry, went ahead as an advanced guard, to clear the low hills. The advanced guard encountered a band of 60 Sarhaddi robbers, who withdrew a short distance, abandoning several donkey loads of sugar. The raiders took up a position on a hill and the South Persia Rifles occupied another hill and opened fire. The enemy retired after losing eight men killed and a number wounded. One Persian non-commissioned officer, South Persia Rifles, was killed. Action against Arabs at Padunii, 26th December 1917. Copy of report from Officer * Commanding Tamm. I have just returned from an expedition to Padumi. My force consisted of 52 South Persia Rifles, and about 100 tufangchis under Ali Reza Khan. Leaving Gakum about 10 a.m. on the 26th instant, I marched via Said Jodar and Birkeh to Marz (dr Murz), a distance of from 40 to 50 miles; when within about 10 miles from Murz it became evident that the bulk of my force could not possibly arrive before daylight, which was essential to the success of my plan. Every mounted man therefore took another man on his horse and we pushed forward in order to surround the Ara;bs to prevent them from escaping. I myself went forward with this advance party, leaving Aziz Ullah Khan in charge of the mam body. t C8Q(w)GSB %14 The advance party arrived a little before daybreak on the 27th and I took up positions surrounding the Arab tents. The fight commenced immediately, although I only wished to hold them until the arrival of the*main body. However we were fairly successful until the cartridges of one party of tufangchis gave out, which permitted the Arabs to send off their women, children, and some of theii* flocks into the hills. It then looked rather serious for us, for the men and some women remained to carry on the fight, Ali Reza Khan thought it best to call on Amir Quli Khan, the Kalantar of Pad ami, for assistance. Fortunately, however, Aziz Ullah Khan and 20 Soith Persia Rifles arrived on the scene about 9 a.m. and we soon gained the upper hand. According to Ali Reza Khan’s inform ation, 16 were killed and a large number wounded, but accurate information is not forthcoming. Certainly the path they took into the mountains towards Darab is easily traceable by the blood spilt. We then looted their tents, and set fire to them afterwards, with the exception of those containing some wounded women and girls. It must be understood that these took up arms against us and no blame therefore attaches to our men. As regards the looting, the tufangchis of Ali Reza Khan were naturally looting the place as soon as we got possession. We also took a flock of 174 sheep, some of which were eaten by the men and the remainder brought here and divided between Ali Reza Khan and myself. I propose issuing them to the Indians as rations. I should like you to call the attention of the Commanding Officer to the wonder ful marching of the men. They marched a distance of nearly 50 miles in less than 24 hours. The last 10 miles or so was over marshy ground and the men sank half way up to the calf in every step. As soon as they arrived they entered i ito a fierce fight which lasted till between two and three o’clock. Among these men it seems invidious to make distinctions, but Vakil Nasrullah, Vakil Ali Jumah, Ali Murad, Ali Shaipurchi (Bugler) and AliHassan arrived with me on the scene of action and went through the whole of the fight. Ali Hassan in particular showed up well when the Arabs were on the point of breaking through at one point and getting into a “ Kharabi ” from which it would have been impossible to dislodge them, he took a village lad and the two held the position. I wanted to get hold of this youngster for the South Persia Rifles, but he disappeared' afterwards. Ali Hassan was formerly a Vakil, but was degraded for a series of offences; I am making him a Lance Sar-i-Jugi again, and have told him that if he behaves he will get on. However, if, as I fully expect, he gets into a scrape again, I hope you will deal leniently with him. He should turn out alright when he gets a little older. ’ Aspirant Aziz Ullah Khan too showed great bravery. For some time he held a position alone which had been vacated by the Tufangchis who ran short of cartridges, until the South Persia Rifles turned up. (It should be explained that he galloped forward when he heard the firing, leaving his men to follow.) Two bullets passed through his hat, which he says was on his head at the time. I hope the Commanding Officer will see his way to making him a Naib, for he seems a good, reliable man. Marigi stuck to his camel which was carrying ammunition under a heavy fire and brought it to a place of safety not too far from the men who were thus able to get ammunition without having recourse to carrying parties which could ill be spared. The Arabs were of the Hassani tribe, and I hear they sent a message to some Bulhasanis living near here demanding one half of the booty we took from them, threatening to inform me of their complicity unless they complied. It is raining now, but as soon as the weather clears I will pay the Bulhasanis a visit. In the fight at Padumi there were no casualties amongst the South Persia Rifles, but one tufangchi was killed and one wounded in the arm The man killed was Mulla Lutf Ali, Kadkhuda Madanu, who leaves a widow and two small girls. OPERATIONS ON THE SHIRAZ-DEHBID ROAD, December 1917, January 1918.15 23rd December 1917,* near Qadrabad, by a gang of raiders supposed to be Boir Almiadis, who were driven oil. The Naib Tufangchi at Qadrabad was suspected of being friendly with these robbers. He had been absent from his post, and never gave any reliable inform ation. After consultation with Colonel E. F. Orton, Officer Commanding Fars Brigade ordered Captain F. Hill, South Persia Rifles Cavalry, from Qavamabad to Qadrabad, to arrest and bring in the Naib Tufangchi. Report of Captain F. Hill, South Persia Rifles. Left Qavamabad with two troops, South Persia Rifles Cavalry. At 12-30 p.iu. I was entering the Tang-i-Kamin, north of Saadatabad, when a charvadar reporteu that a Persian caravan of donkeys and camels had been carried off near the north entrance of Tang-i-Kamin (3 miles off). * I advanced quickly. On reaching the north entrance of the Tang-i-Kamin&gt; my patrols reported that the robbers were driving the looted animals down the valley in a south-easterly direction. I galloped south-east in extended order, and a rear guard of raiders, about 50 strong, who were extended across the valley, opened fire. The South Persia Rifles took cover, dismounted, and returned the raiders’ fire at long range. I could see the looted animals being driven away. I could not get any South Persia Rifles men to advance to close contact with the raiders. I recovered about one-fourth of the looted animals and loads (chiefly raw cotton). The South Persia Rifles suffered no casualties, and I do not think the raiders had any losses either. The South Persia Rifles fired about 1,700 rounds. The South Persia Rifles were much out of hand, and I was not pleased with their performance. On 3rd January the raiders restored all the animals (but not the remainder of the loads) to the Persian owners. I returned to Saadatabad, which was reached about 7 p.m., and halted there. 1 marched to Qadrabad with the two troops, South Persia Rifles, arrested the two headmen of the local tufangchis there, and took them back to Saadatabad. Returned to QaVamabad. The two men arrested were sent under escort to Shiraz. The Officer Com manding Fars Brigade handed them o ver to His Highness Prince Farman Farma, who punished them. The Naib Tufangchis at Saadatabad reported that a large number of robbers had collected again at the north end of the Tang-i-Kamin. I proceeded to Saadatabad with 3 troops, South Persia Rifles (54 men), and reconnoitred, but saw no sign of raiders. I proceeded to Qadrabad. All clear. I was returning from Qadrabad, and at 11-30 a.m. was near the Tang-i-Kamin, and had just passed a Persian caravan of about 500 camels and a few donkeys, which was in straggling formation. Shots were fired on my left (east) flank. I occupied some low hills on the left (east) side of the road, and a desultory engage ment with the raiders followed at a range of about 400 yards, which lasted for about half an hour. Half the caravan escaped through the low hills, and gained the Tang-i- Kamin The other half of the caravan fell into the hands of the robbers, who had now turned my left Hank. The robbers were about 20J strong. *A »eparate report has been rendered. January 1st, 1918. January Sad. January 3rd. January 16 th, January 17th. January 18th,16 The raiders now pressed their attack against the South Persia Rifles and! one sovar was killed. The South Persia Rifles then broke, mounted, and retreated! about 3 miles into some hills overlooking the Tang-i-Kamin, Only the following stayed with me Corporal Batson, 21st Lancers. Aspirant II Haidar Khan, South Persia Rifles, Savar Allah Quli, South Persia Rifles, The enemy were now 56 yards off and advancing quickly. A\e mounted. Corporal Batson’s horse was wounded, shot through the neck, but was able to go. After we had gone about 100 yards, my horse was mortally wounded and fell, and I had to escape on foot. The fire was fairly heavy and my hat was shot off' mvhead. We were not followed, as the raiders all turned to the captured portion of the caravan. The raiders drove off camels loaded with loot towards the south-'east. I returned to the scene of the action and recovered about 40 bags of barley which had fallen from the stampeded camels. I then returned down the Tang-i-Kamin to Saadatabad, which was reached about 5 p. M. I rode on myself to Qavamabad, where I telephoned the news about 7 p.m. to Shiraz. Our casualties were :— Killed. —No. 283 Savar Kaka Khan, 3rd Cavalry, South Persia Rifles. Wounded (slight ).—344 Lance Sar-i-Jugi Ahmed Beg, 3rd Cavalry,, • South Persia Rifles. Horses .—Killed one, wounded one. The camel-men, who were subsequently released by the raiders, reported after wards that the raiders lost 3 men killed and two were severely wounded. Ammunition expended,—'*303 ,897 rounds. January 21st. January 24th. January 27tb. Major H. R. Dyer arrived at Qavamabad with one squadron Burma Mounted Infantry. I accompanied him, in his subsequent operations, with two weak troops. South Persia Rifles (33 men). During the first action against Meshedi Jani Khan Arabs, near Gumun, the South Persia Rifles savars were distributed among the 4 troops of Burma Mounted Infantry, chiefly to act as interpreters and guides. They were subsequently put in charge of the prisoners and captured animals. When the Arabs made a counter-attack against the captured animals, the South Persia Rifles savars were mainly concerned in seeing to their own safety, and allow ed the prisoners to escape. During the second action against Meshedi Jani Khan Arabs, 4 miles south-west of Gumun, the South Persia Rifles troops collected the Arabs’ camels from the plain on the left flank, which I sent oft towards Arsinjan under one weak troop. With the' other weak troop (15 men) I returned to the left flank, but the South Persia Rifles savars could not be got up closer than 800 yards from the enemy. I did my best with the men collected at Qavamabad out of the small posts - They were not, however, of a good stamp, and I am of opinion that their wholesale dismissal from the South Persia Rifles is called for. Shiraz : The 7th February 1918. (Signed) F. HILL, Captain, South Persia Rifles',17 i Encounter with robbers on the Dehbid-Hanashk road, 17th January 1918. On the 17th January 1918, Captain Kyle received news in Dehbid that a band of robbers had, the previous day, robbed a caravan of 100 donkeys. » He immediately left Dehbid with a small force. On arrival at a spot 3J miles beyond the place of the robbery, he was fired on by the raiders who had taken up all commanding positions on the hills to the left of the road. They shortly abandoned one of the hills and Captain Kyle endeavoured to occupy it. He was, however, unable to attain his objective as it would have entailed prolonged exposure to the enemy’s fire. The small South Persia Rifles force, which was heavily outnumbered, had to retire under a well-directed fire from the robbers at a range of about one mile. No South Persia Rifles casualties occurred. Operations of Burma Mounted Infantry, January 1918. Copy of a letter No. 128-23-G., dated the 18th January 1918, from General Staff, South Persia Rifles, to Major Dyer, B. M. 1. Captain Hill, South Persia Rifles, has telephoned this evening from Qavam- abad that he with 50 South Persia Rifles Cavalry encountered a party of raiders, probably at least 200 strong, on the north side of Saadatabad (Tang-i-Kamin). One man of South Persia Rifles was killed and Captain Hill’s horse was shot under him. The South Persia Rifles fell back on Saadatabad where they were left by Captain Hill whilst he himself proceeded to Qavamabad to report by telephone. • The raiders are said to consist of men of four different tribes, but no further details are known. 2. One complete squadron, B. M. I., under your command, with one subaltern, will start from the Bagh-i-Nawab at 11 a.m. on Saturday, 19th January, and pro ceed by the following marches :— 1. Zarghun. 2. Kinareh. 3. Qavamabad. 3. On arrival at Qavamabad you will get into 'communication with Captain Hill and ascertain the latest information. You will then follow up and attack the raiders, but should not proceed more than 30 (thirty) miles off the main road. 4. The following transport for the use of the B. M. I. squadron will be sent to the Bagh-i-Nawab by the Officer Commanding, Pars Brigade, to-morrow morning, by 9-30 a.m. Mules. 2 days’ grain for horses .. 4 days’ rations for men S. A. A.

Replenishments of rations can be obtained at Zarghun and Qavamabad. Copies to the Assistant Director of Medical Services. Officer Commanding, Fars Brigade, i / Verbal instmctions given to Major Dyer by Colonel Orton, just before he started on the morning of 19th January 1918, from Shiraz. 1. Information has been received that the tribes implicated in the attack on 18th January at Tang-i-Kamin, were Lashanis, Meshedi Jani Khan Arabs, and Mishmasts. . The Mishmasts live 'near Arsinjan. The Meshedi Jani Khan Arabs have en campments scattered along the valleys on the east side of the Qavamabad-Tang-i- Kamin road. 2. You must get more information from Captain Hill, after reaching Qavam abad. 3. You must first clear up the situation north of Saadatabad along the Tan^-i- Kamin pass, and ensure that the accumulation of Persian caravans, which have been stopped at Saadatabad, get through northwards and southwards. 4. It is essential to cause casualties among the raiders, and you should attack; them, when followed up and found, with a view to killing raiders. 5. You should not penetrate into the Lashani country. The terrain there is too difficult for your small force. The limit of 30 miles off the main road gives yon a wide-discretion, but it is purposely intended to keep you out of the Lashani country. Shiraz, January 19th 1918. E. F. ORTON, Colonel, Officiating Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles. 19th January 1918. 20th 1918. 21st 3918. January Report of the work carried ovih, “ B ” Spndron, Burma Mounted Infantry, awl one I roop, South Persia Rifles, from 19th January to 3rd February 1918. Zarghun “ B Squadron (strength see appendix “ A ”) marched from Ba^h-i- JNawab, 11a. m. arriving Zarghun 5-30 p. m. (21 miles.) ° During the march and during the night the usual precautions taken. Weather fine and cold. Kinareh.—Leit Zarghun 9 a. m. arrived Kinareh 1-30 p. m. (14 miles). During the march and in camp all usual precautions taken—weather fine and January cold. Qavamabad. Left Kinareh 9 a. m. arrived Qavamabad 4-15 p M (20 miles! usual precautions taken-weather cold and bright. The column marched concentratl ed as far as Hajiabad (D -4). From there the squadron split in two one half cornu XgsI Shahsharbun Pass ( D '*&gt; the remainder, with' baggag^CSa19 Daalitabad (D.-4). The half squadron, on arrival at Sivand, waited for the bag gage with remainder of squadron and thence marched to Qavamabad. (March via Shahsharbun pass, 16 miles). Captain Hill, South Persia Rifles, met the column at Sivand. From Sivand scouts were sent over the hills north-east along pathways which led to Qavama bad. This precaution was taken owing to a report that 50 of the enemy were on the hills near Qavamabad. On arrival at camp the following information regarding the enemy was given me by Captain Hill, that 200 Arabs, Mishmast and Lashani, headed by Rahim Agha Lashani and Said Ulla Khan Arab, were lying in the low hills, 2 miles north-east of the Tang-i-Kamin (D. S. 17-F.-B.-4) from 18th January 1918 and had been joined by another 100 of their fighting men on 20th January 1918. On receipt of this information I decided on the following plan :— “ B ” Squadron, B.M.I., and 1st Line transport under Lieutenant Thacker would march from Qavamabad at 2 A. m., on the 22nd via Saadatabad and the Tang-i-Kamin to Kaleh-i-Jalk (D.-S.-17-F.-B.-4), to arrive there by 5-30 a. m. Two troops, South Persia Rifles, under Captain Hill to leave Qavamabad at 4 a. m. arriving at the east mouth of the Tang-i-Kamin by 7 a. m. to take up a position along the two hills east of the road running north to Qavamabad. Baggage to march at 7 A. m. under Sergeant Goodwill to Saadatabad where it was to park and await further orders. Special Idea .—“ B ” Squadron, Burma Mounted Infantry, was ordered on arrival at Kaleh-i-Jalk to send out patrols and to watch the following passes (D.-S.- 17-F.-B.-4) Arsinjan Pass south over the Tang-i-Bulagi Hills, the Chah Daraz Pass south-east the Tang-i-Falak, north over the Mian Mullah Hills. The remainder of the squadron thence to proceed to the Kaleh Haji Mohomed Shaft. From here the squadron to extend in column of half squadrons and proceed due north over the hills for six miles. Thence turning west and driving in extended order in the same formation towards the Tang-i-Kamin and if enemy as reported met in hills to be vigorously attacked and driven in the direction of the w r est mouth of the Tang-i- Kamin where the South Persia Rifles would attack them on their approach and thus regain their morale which they had lost on the 18th by being attacked by over whelming odds. Saadatabad .—The column moved as orders issued on 21st January. Officer Commanding marched with advanced guard of Burma Mounted Infantry Squadron. The operations were carried out as described in special idea of 2lst January. During the day this squadron covered 30 to 35 miles scouts and patrols 35 to 40 miles and no signs of the imported enemy were seen or heard of. The column returned to camp at Saadatabad at 4 p. m., an extremely cold and cloudy day. On arrival in camp the following [information was received from the Naib Tufangchi Beyzat Khan of Saadatabad, that the enemy which was reported over the country we had reconnoitred during the day had left the day before in the direc tion of Gumun (D.-S.-17-G.-B.-1) via Arsinjan and Chah Daraz Passes. On this information I decided to move with the column next day (23rd) to Arsinjan which is situated in the centre of the Sinjan Valley. (B.-l). The column to march at 9 a. m. in the following formation. All Burma Mounted Rifles scouts 2 miles in front, South Persia Rifles under Captain Hill, advance guard, “ B ” Squadron, Burma Mounted Infantry, in line'of troop column. Main body minus one troop rear guard-baggage to follow immediately in rear of main body. 1st fine transport proceeding. Officer Comanding to march with advance guard. Arsinjan .—The column marched as ordered on 22nd January 1918 from Saadatabad at 9 a. m., arriving Arsinjan 2 p. m. (12 miles), weather cloudy and cold; appearance of snow arriving. On arrival in camp I called on the Deputy Governor, Sarang Hamza Khan of the C.-1. Arsinjan District, who supplied the following information regarding the enemy. 24th January There were several Arab encampments in the vicinity of Gumun (17-G.-B.-1), who were under their chief Saidulla Khan. 22nd 1918.

Special Idea. —The column with 1st line transport to move at 7 a. m. in an easterly direction along the foot of the hills on the north of the Arsinjan valley via Chashmeh-Taghargi-Kalet-i-Khiri (B.-l), then south-east at Gardaneh Kuchzun (C.-l), then south-west down the river bed marked in map (C.-l) to the edge of lake Tasht, thence north-west to Gumun (B.-l). Enemy met anywhere near Gumun to be vigorously attacked. Camps burnt and booty to be brought to camp Arsinjan. Before leaving camp kits under guard of one troop Burma Mounted Infantry and Indian officer, to be ready packed and transport ready to move if required. Signalling station one helio with 2 signallers to remain with baggage to keep in communication with column operating during the day. Burma Mounted Infantry doctor to remain with baggage. South Persia Rifles doctor to accompany column. The column to moy£ in following formation. Two British officers, patrols; one under Captain Hill along the low hills north of Arsinjan Valley, one under Lieutenant Thacker 2,000 yards to south of Captain Hill’s patrol to move in the direction already mentioned above. The main body, three troops, Burma Mounted Infantrv, and one troop, South Persia Rifles, under Officer Commanding to move in 5 line of troop columns in centre and rear of officer’s patrols. 24th Jan. 1918, Arsinjan .—The column (see Appendix A) moved as in orders issued on d. s.-itg., b.-i. the 23rd January 1918. At 11 a.m. the column halted and fed in river bed, west of gorge. Left patrol (Captain Hill) reported that they had seen signs of recently evacuated camp in the hills at Chasmeh Taghargi (B. 1) and fresh tracks of camels, sheep and donkeys proceeding in the direction of Gardaneh Chizun (G. 1). The column then moved to Gardaneh Chizun and as sheep were seen grazing on the right flank, two patrols were sent, one under a non-commissoned officer, one under an Indian officer; the former had orders to ascertain to whom the sheep belonged, the latter to keep along the hills overlooking the plains to ascertain the exact camping grounds of the enemy. Thence the column moved south down the *’ lver Ike edge of Lake Tasht. On debouching from the river mouth on the plain the first enemy’s camp was seen under the low hills to the west which was found to be half evacuated—the enemy having fled into the low hills to the north. On the plain a convoy of camels, donkeys and sheep was seen escaping m a southerly direction. One troop under Lieutenant Thacker, who had rejoined with his patrol, was ordered to follow up and capture the moving convoy The remainder of the column moved in the direction of the partly occupied camp! An Indian officer s patrol was sent out on the left flank to proceed in a southerly director, in line with Lieutenant Thacker’s troop. The main body on reaching the first camp at 1 p.m. burnt 30 tents and came under fire from the low hills to thf north. A report came m from Lieutenant Thacker that he had located a much larger camp under the low hills 2 miles south of the second “ N ” of Sinian (B 11 and was proceeding there. The main body followed up in line of troop columns One mile east of this camp, as the column was moving 'up to it Oantnin Hill from the main body. Whilst thif operatmVw^ beL trtd oi tr ^ ^ sisting of about 60 tents, was burnt the women and childrenb»f« C011 : placed in two tents left for their occunation Pa™ l i Cn collected and collected by a troop under Captain 1™ ^' ° amel \ s]lee P&gt; donkeys were Rifles together with six prisoners with orders todrive thenfback to V’jT* road leading through the low hills via Chahsurk. b L P by theBy 3 p.m. Captain Hill moved off with animals he had collected—Lieutenant Thacker was ordered tp retire from the hills south of the camp. The column, formed of three troops, Burma Mounted Infantry, forming a rear guard. Before the rear guard moved off an Indian officer’s patrol who had been sent out to the left flank, returned, reporting that he had seen a large enemy’s camp at the foot of the low hills in the bay north of the “ L ” in Lake Tasht. Also the Indian officer’s patrol who had been sent out on the right flank to overlook the plain returned and reported that two encampments in the low hills at Chah Surk had been located. I then sent him off with one troop to proceed in advance of the cattle and piquet the hills north-west of the “ C ” in Chah Surk over which the road passed. The rear guard left enemy’s camp under fire from the Ifills to which enemy had returned At 3-30 p.m. at which time the sound of firing was also heard from the direction in which the cattle were moving under Captian Hill. The rear guard on entering the gorge a mile south-west of the second “ N ” in Sinjan came under heavy fire from both flanks and rear. From here a rear guard action was fought through the low hills keeping the enemy off the cattle which they were trying to recover. On nearing Chah Surk two more camps about 30 tents each were burnt—the armed inhabitants taking to the hills and joining the enemy. The enemy followed up the column to 2 miles east of Chah Surk until 5 p.m. when they broke off the action. During the retirement a certain number of cattle got away, also all the prisoners. The column with cattle, etc., reached camp at 9 p.m. The non-commissioned officer’s patrol, which was left on the right flank to ascertain the owner of the sheep seen on the hills, came into camp with 300 head at 9-30 p.m. This patrol had been attacked during its retirement to camp by superior numbers, but succeeded in bringing in the cattle without casualties to itself though inflicting loss on the enemy. Our casualties during the day were wounded non-commissioned officers and men. Roll of Honour— No. 25 Daffadar Partab Singh, slight. No. 63 Lahce-Daffadar Sewa Singh, slight. No. 143 Sowar Bhan Singh, severe. Horses wounded— Nos. 191, 172, 199, 272, 221, 203, “ B” Squadron No. 14 “A ” Squadron. All wounds inflicted were caused by [small bore modern rifle bullets.

Weather cloudy and very cold, started snowing 11 P.M. Ardnjari .—Snowed heavily during morning. Rested—found shelter for column 2 ^th in buildings on west of Village—received message 8 a.m. from Colonel Orton, dated 1918, 23rd January 1918, advising return to Shiraz. Replied to. Deputy Governor sent out spies to ascertain exact loss and dispositions of enemy. Weather cleared during middle of day, but started snowing 3-30 p.m., continued well into night. As there was a shortage of bhoosa for animals decided if fine to go out next day on a foraging expedition to neighbouring villages with whole of column. On account of smallness of column all cattle taken on 24th January were handed over to Deputy Governor of Arsinjan district and receipts taken. iC80(w)GSB January \22 ^ , i 26ih January Arsinjan. — A bright cold morning. Column consisting of squadron Burma 1918 - Mounted Infantry, one troop South Persia Rifles and 30 transport mules moved off 11 a.m. on foraging expedition, following direction, first east to \i age of Akbarabad, 2 miles 'from Arsinjan, thence south-west to village of Alia bad, Rafiabad, Hussainabad, Kalut Khur (D.S. 17-G. B.I.). Bhoosa was collected sufficient for two days and paid for on the spot. Column returned to camp 4-30 p.m. (12 miles). On arrival at camp I was met by 12 armed men, the leader’s name was Suliman Khan and he gave me several stories, one of which was that he had had some donkeys stolen laden with Govefnement barley and he had been out with Captain Townley somewhere neal Dehbid trying to recover same and now he was on his way through to Tasht for the same object. Though he had been in Arsinjan a couple of hours he had not reported to the Deputy Governor, so I made them all prisoners and kept them in the Quarter Guard, as I was not satisfied with their statements, received four letters brought in by 2 Kasids from Rais Ahmed Khan Lashani of Khwaja Jamali stating he wished to come over and join me to help and punish the Lashanis under Rahim Agha who, he considered, a black dog and a knave to the Government. As I was thinking of attacking the next Arab encampment near the one I had attacked on the 24th. I put these two Kasids in the Quarter Guard and intend to answer the letters when I have finished my attack. The Governor’s spies, who had gone out the day before as already mentioned, stated that the Arabs, who had been attacked and defeated on the 24th by me, were at Katah (B.-2) and were proceeding to the Garmsir. He also reported their casualties at eight killed. He said there was another encampment of Arabs 3 miles south-west of where I had attacked the second encampment on 24th January 1918. Another spy, who had gone out in the direction of Tasht, came in and reported that the Lashanis in that direction had removed all their families and goods into the hills and were awaiting an attack from us. On all the above information, weather permitting I decided to attack the Arab encampment reported by the spy 4 miles south-west of Gitmun. Special idea. —The column with 1st line transport to start at 8 a.m. strength January 4 troops Burma Mounted Infantry, 1 troop, South Persia Rifles baggage to be left in camp with sufficient guards, Medical Officer, Burma Mounted Infantry, to accompany column.

The main body to march in line of troop columns, Officer Commanding with advance guard. Arsinjan. —Column started off at the trot at 8 a.m. as ordered on the 26th and Sketch map B. continued and thus halting every half hour for 5 minutes until contact with enemy was made in low hills, one mile north of “ L ” in Lake, at 10-30 a.m. The advance guard came under fire on approaching ridge A, scouts being 800 yards ahead. Advance guard dismounted and took cover behind ridge A. Main bodv was ordered to move up at the gallop. In the meantime the enemy was located hold ing hill “ B ” and “ C ”, I noticed a pathway running between A and B in the direction of Arsinjan, and I decided that after the action this should be my line of retirement to camp. As main body came up to ridge A and dismounted, advance guard was moved off to right flank up high hills to dominate D and C and ordered to move along the higher ridges to prevent enemy turning our right flank. One troop was sent to keep on the left of the advance guard and move in the same direction, with the same objective. Captain Hill was then sent out with the South Persia Rifles troop to drive all camels, cattle, etc., on the plain and see in the direc tion of B and A along the pathway mentioned above. One troop under a Jemadar was ordered .do gallop forward and drive the enemy from B under a covering fire from the troop left A. As soon as this troop arrived at B the enemy retired^to C (about 30 horsemen), and this troop was then reinforced at B by a troop from A In the meantime the two troops on the right flank got possession of the higher slopes 27th 1918.(3) 23 of ridge C. A troop was at once advanced from B to C. This troop in going up the ridge got within 10 yards of the enemy who did not wait for them to get any Closer. As they retired into the river bed and up the slopes to ridge D they suffer ed heavy lossess. The next troop from B advanced to the edge of ridge C overlook ing the mouth of the river bed to north of “ L ” in Lake. In the meantime the extreme right troop had crossed over to ridge and advanced outflanking the enemy and driving them across our front. As soon as this was noticed the troops at the edge of ridge C crossed the river bed and took^ up a position at the end of the spur of ridge D. The enemy was finding both their flanks turned and being hemmed m retired due south. Whilst above movements were taking place the enemy s encampment was located in the river bed north-west of the “ L m Lake. Volunteers were called for from the second troop on the left flank to go down to the river bed and burn the camp and goods which were packed ready for removal. Two men were permitted to go down and carry this out. They did this work thoroughly though under a heavy fire during a part of the time. All cattle that were collected were driven along the road, I decided to retire by, under escort of South Persia Bifles. A dressing station was formed under ridge L and all wounded were collected and sent back along the road the cattle had taken. By 2-30 p.m. the enemy had been flattened out and were seen running o\er the hills due west. There were a lot of camels, donkeys and sheep scattered over the ridge of D, and I decided to leave these animals on account of the smallness oi my force and the lateness of the hour. After the cattle had been collected by the South Persia Rifles and sent off, the remainder of this troop under Captain Hill were on my left flank watching the ridge 4 miles south-west of “ L ” in Lake. At 3-30 p.m. the column concentrated at the fork of the river between ridge D and C. An Indian officer s patrol an all scouts were sent out down the river to get m touch with Captain Hill s troops and bring them in—whilst they were out they were sniped at by a few- of the enemy who had probably remained or returned to see what their camp looked like, i he column at 4 p.m. returned along the road leading over hills via Ivalat-lvhur, Aliabad to camp picking up the camels and cattle and dnvmg them in, arriving at camp at 9 p.m. Captain Hill and his troop retired via the road we came out during the morning and returned to camp at 9-30 p.m. Our casualties during the day were :— Roll of Honour.

You may return the 400 sheep to headman Akbarabad if satisfied that claim is genuine and take receipt for them.” isth January Arsinjan. — A fine morning, but during the afternoon clouded over. All the m8, cattle that had been handed over to Deputy Governor, Arsinjan, were taken and together with the animals taken in fight of 27th were sent into Qavamabad under escort of South Persia Rifles. I answered the letters received from Rais Ahmed Khan, Lashani, stating that “ I was very glad to hear from him and that I would very shortly come ancf visit him, being at the present time busy. Hoping his health was well and that our meeting would be a friendly one.” The reply was sent to him by the men who had brought in his letter to me and who had been kept in the Quarter Guard meanwhile. / Rested during the day. The Deputy Governor informed us that it was reported that Saidulla Khan had been killed in the action of yesterday (27th). March orders for the next day were, all sick and wounded men and animals to march at 8 a.m. Baggage at 8-30 a.m. Column at 9-30 a.m. for Qavamabad.

The column arrived at Qavamabad at 6 p.m. the rear guard with a few wound ed arrived at 7 p.m. (distance 22 miles). The hardships of the march were borne by all ranks with great cheerfulness and everything possible was done to alleviate the suffering of the wounded, who appeared none the worse for what they had 30th Jamia-ygone through.

C80(W) jSB/y 28 Copy of a report No. 243-L., dated the 5th March 1918, from the Commandant, Abadeh, to the Officer Commanding, Fars Brigade. I have the honour to report as follows as regards certain operations against robbers undertaken by the troops of this garrison between the dates of 24th and 28th February 1918. I had received between the 18th and 22nd February Several reports as ta robbers in the vicinity of Yezd-i-Khast, most of which contradicted each other. Vague reports were received of four separate bands reported to be Boir Ahmadis,^ Sarhaddis, Nafaris. Vhe estimated strength of bands varied form 80 to 200 . Naib Safadar Khan who commands the posts north of Abadeh, who was in here at the time that the reports were received, considered that it was quite impossible that the Boir Ahmadis should have come across yet owing to the snow on the passes. Keports all agreed that the bands had crossed the Isfahan road and proceeded towards Yezd. On the 22 nd (afternoon) a report was received that there was a party of men in the vicinity of Yezd-i-Khast who had so far not interfered with caravans or flocks.- Northward bound caravans had been stopped at Yezd-i-Khast and Shulgistan and were waiting for orders. On the same day a report was received from a traveller from Isfahan that a party of Boir Ahmadis under Bakhtiari influence intended to make an attempt to get a caravan of Ziegler's which was then halted at Yezd-i-Khast. I had had a report on the 16th that the Boir Ahmadis were preparing a raid on the Isfahan road, but I was assured by all the local expert opinion that the Bom Ahmadi could not come down yet owing to the snow. However, I decided to send out a column under Captain Duggan to cleat up the road as far as Aminabad. 1 1 his column, consisting of 1 troop, 3rd Cavalry, and 1 (“ C ”) Companv 3rcT- Infantry, started on the 23rd. r'. J’ ^ i i °fi uf 2 Y ’ a , b ,° Ut 2 P ' 1 r 1 ec, -' iml a re P° rt from Captain Duggan that he had had a fight with robbers near \ ezd-i-Khast and had lost some men, rifles and horses, is report is attached Considering the information as to the number of the robbers and the way they fought, I thought there might be some truth in the rumours that a serious attempt was to be made to hold up the road and capture the Ziegler caravan and I hoped that, elated by their temporary success in holding off Captain Duggan s men the robbers might be tempted to stay I was very anxmus to recover the lost rifles and horses, so decided to take out a sufficients strong orce to surround the robbers or at least cut off their retreat. The available cavahv Salta's SEfsar —»^—-»- £ collect, I decided to start on the followL dYv^to to “' n 7 . u ’ d ta ke some time to Khast and arrive there after dark in theViall’ hoot throu ^ t( ! become known. I therefore sent out a TssLe toV,t m ?, amVal ml g ht no{ publish abroad that he was going back to Ahadef , „ i / ptal , n H ”'' 111 to him to tions for doing so. g 8 Abadeh&gt; and to make alt outward prepara- ed the 2 ° th and -nsist- E; 70 ^ numb^Yf ToYbmfhold^feaYlr mS^ 7V V 8 received of a Ia ^ believe this report. At 6 4 the catl^VT^ ^ 1 didnot there at 10-30 p.m. The infantry left Shuleistui 7 ezd l '^ ka st and arrived at 2-30 A.M., having marched 40 miles in To hours 3V ^ reaclled Yezd-i-Khast ancs as the last half of the march was done amiinst » h 1 u a T ei T fine Perform- on very heavy going. They arrived very tired' atd the T7 d driving S ‘ eet a ' ld y nreu, and the lack of rations, especially9n 29 \ such items as tea and sugar, was much felt, as although firewood was ready for them on their arrival, the men were unable to obtain any hot food until the morning. Immediately on arrival I collected all available information as to the whereabouts of robbers and the possibility of bringing them to book. Captain Duggan had taken all possible steps to collect information and to prevent news reaching the robbers. It was fairly well established that the robbers were about 17 miles away on the road to Hanna and could go no further owing to deep snow. It was also reported that for some miles on this side of them the snow was knee-deep. As it was snowing hard I abandoned all hope of being able to do anything on the 27th. It was generally expected that provided there was not a hard frost the robbers would be forced to return towards Henagun, and I accordingly took steps to have all the roads in that direction watched. On the morning of the 27th it snowed until midday. Spies and agents were sent out to watch the robbers, and there seemed good reason to hope that they would be forced to come down to lower ground and to go near some village where they could get food. About 10 p.m. some of the spies came in and reported that the robbers were still in the same place. The information was not very reliable as the spies had not been able to get very close, owing, they said, to the heavy snow. During the night of the 27th-28th it froze hard, and early in the morning spies came in to report that during the night the robbers had gone and that they had followed their tracks for a couple of miles over the frozen snow in the direction of Henna. I sent out patrols up to a radius of 5 or 6 miles, all of whom reported the country clear. I sent on to Aminabad, with an escort of 50 men, the large accumulation of camels in Yezd-i-Khast, about 700 or 800. I went out with Captain Duggan to see the ground on which his fight had taken place, and from his description of the action and the disposition of the robbers, it is evident that Captain Duggan must have acted with great judgment and cool ness to have extricated his little force from an extremely precarious positron. His original dispositions were sound but a detachment sent out to his right failed to secure the high ground which was already apparently in the possession ot the robbers and the horses of this detachment were surrounded, one horse-m der killed and the other wounded, four horses killed and five fell into the hands of the robbers. The loss of horses, rifles and ammunition is regrettable but was, under the circumstances, unavoidable. It was quite impossible for Captain Duggan to get his wounded away in his retirement. The robbers were remarkably bold and in some cases were extremely brave, creeping up to within 30 yards. Captain Duggan only just managed to shoot a man in time who was aiming at him from about 30 yards. Captain Duggan reports that the robbers were extremely quick and agile, and were all round his force and would have undoubtedly cut off his retreat but for the timely arrival of the 35 infantry under Naib Abdul Hussain. What does not appear quite plainly from Captain Duggan’s report is that after the arrival of these infantry he advanced aa ain and refovered his wounded who had been stripped of their rifles and am munition One man, Ghulam Hussain, had been very roughly handled, presum ably because he was a Turk from Tabriz. This man afterwards died of h.s wounds. He was not able to find all his dead until the day following the 6^ '’hen the bndv of Vskil Rahim previously reported missing, was also found. Both Captain San Ind SerSaniVattle report that the men fought extremely well and m extremely trying conditions showed no disposition to bolt. Captain Duggan’s total casualties in men were : Killed .— Naib Safdar Khan, 3rd Infantry. No. 3505 Vakil Rahim, 3rd Cavalry. *30 mm Xo. C. F. 40 Glmli, 3rd Cavalry; No. C.

Slightly wounded .—Sergeant Battle, 1st South Lancashire Regiment. All the wounded are doing very well. Captain Duggan was very suspicious that he had been led into a trap and that the numbers were deliberately falsely represented. He based his suspicions on the fact that the robbers were very obviously prepared for his coming, and that the party whose horses were lost was led by his guide and informant. The guide was Seyyid Hassan, brother of Seyyid Yadollah, Naib Tufangchi of Yezd-i-Khast. 1 do not think there are sufficient grounds for these suspicions. From the place where the robbers most probably had their look-outs, Captain Duggan’s party could be seen coming for about 3 miles, and the robbers had ample time to lay an ambush. Also I do not think any Persian would have voluntarily run the risks which the guide ran with the remainder of the party. Actually his horse was killed. At the same time I can hardly believe that Seyyid Yadollah did not know more exactly the strength of the robbers. There is no doubt a few days before they had sent into Yezd-i-Khast for food, and there are good reasons for believing that part of this food was received from Seyyid Yadollah himself. I am afraid it is useless to expect these villagers not to help robbers in that way until we can ensure the safety of their flocks, as a refusal on their part to supply food would certainly mean the robbery of their flocks. Their attitude is that “ gendarmeries come and go but the robbers are with us always.” At the same time it cannot be allowed that tufangchis in the pay of the South Persia Rifles should be allowed to help robbers in this way, and] I have already communicated with you on the subject of dismissal of Seyyid Yadollah. On the evening of the 28th a robber spy was captured in Yezd-i-Khast. He admitted he had been with the robbers, but said he Had run away from them. From various facts it was obvious he was a spy. He states as follows “ The robbers were Boir Ahmadis from Sisakht and Padana and Farsi Maidanis; the leader was Ka Mohamad Reza, son-in-law of Mullah Kobad of Padana. The other chiefs were Mullah Faraj of Sisakht, Mir Ali Boir Maliki (?) of Padana, Karin Beg Farsi Madani of Kiffteh. They had robbed a flock of 1,200 sheep from Peikoon in Isfahan territory, said to belong to sedentary Arabs, and intended stopping for a day or two near Yezd-i-Khas? see what they could pick up in the way of caravans. As there was no further information of robbers, on the 28th or 1st March I returned with all troops to Shulgistan, and on the following day to Abadeh Telephones at the posts of Shulgistan and Yezd-i-Khast or a field telephone with Captain Duggan would have been of considerable value. Cojpy of Captain Duggans report, Yezd-i-Khast, dated 25th February 1918. On a,raval at Yezd-i-Khast at 1-30 p m., 2tth February 1918, the Naib tufans- cln Seyyid Yadollah informed me that a report had just arrived that there-wefe .some 8 or 10 robbers encamped in the foothills about a farsakh to the west of Yerd -i-Khost (see D. S. . a little to west of “ Y ” in Yezd-i-Khn^ 1 ; diately sent 10 men from the Yezd-i-Khast post, under the Vakil, to approach this' place from the western side. I Sergeant Battle, Naib Abdullah Khan, Nail Safdar Khan and the troop of A ’ squadron left at 2 p.m. and approached from the east, I ordered Naib Abdul Hussain Khan of 3rd Infantry and 35 Rank and file of B Company to follow up behind in case they were required *wmm 31 On arrival m the foothills, which were very rough and in formation a series 0 gullies the robbers opened fire on us from direct front and things became very hot indeed. We had previously split up into 3 parties and approached the sup posed camping ground from different directions dismounted. The robbers then appeared on all the surrounding knolls and the infantry on our left were also engaging them, they were steadily creeping up behind stones towards us and 1 saw we could do nothing as we were, so ordered men to retire to a higher knoll behind us. This we did and after arrival there the 35 men of “ B ” Company turned up. The robbers then began to see the tables would be turned and made off! In the. retirement Naib Safdar was killed. The following were also killed No. C. F. 40 Ghuli, 3rd Cavalry. *No. C. F. 921 Mirza Mohamad Hassan, 3rd Cavalry. Wounded .— *No. 31 Hassan, 3rd Cavalry. No. C. F. 2974 Ali, 3rd Cavalry. No. C. F. ? Ghulam Hussain, 3rd Cavalry. Missing.—No. C. F. 3505 Vakil Rahim, 3rd Cavalry. Horses. —Killed 4, missing 6, wounded 1. Ammunition expended — 3rd Cavalry, 405 rounds. 3rd Infantry, 472 rounds. Lost on killed, wounded and missing, 6 carbines L. E., 1 540 rounds ammunition. M auser carbine and The robbers who numbered about 150 to 200 unmounted and 20 mounted are said to be Boir Ahmadis from Mullah Kobad. They were evidently expecting us and had themselves extremely well hidden. The horses killed and missing together with the men marked* above who were horse-holders, were surrounded after the one party had dismounted. The behaviour of the men was excellent although we were ourselves nearly surrounded and owing to false report as to numbers were taken somewhat by sur prise. J When I realized the strength of robbers I sent a sowar back to Yezd-i Khast to order out all troops left behind but they did not reach us in time and as it was getting dark it was useless our attempting anything else. I sent out men from the village to try and ascertain where the robbers are making for and am remaining here until I hear from you or get information to the effect that the robbers are in a more easily attacked place. I am holding caravan up to-morrow but if there is nothing to effect that robbers are in a more suitable position for us to attack them will accompany the caravan to Aminabad and return. Casualties of robbers not ascertained but it is certain 6 were killed and taken off. I feel that had we had bayonets we might have rushed them and I think the men would not have held back. I cannot say enough for the way the men behaved under the circumstances and considering the difficult ground. The robbers, too, showed great pluck. Sergeant Battle received a very slight scratch on the shoulder due to a splinter. Note by Captain Fraser, dated the 12th March 1918. Since writing my report information has been received from Hanna that the robbers passed through that village on their homeward journey, that they had 3 wounded with them and said they had 8 killed in the fight. Another 7 or 8 had died of exposure in the snow and two-thirds of the stolen sheep had also perished. G. M.
