MEMORANDUM , It would appear that in December 1925 an original concession for the operation of a petroleum field in the Bahrein Islands was conceded by the Sheik of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndicate, a British company. In November 1927 this syndicate gave to the Gulf Oil Company of Pennsylvania an option contract covering this concession, but the latter company, since it was a member of the American group, was debarred from operating in the Bahrein Islands by the terms of the Turkish Petroleum Company agreement signed on July 51st, 1928• On December 21st, 1928, the Gulf Company, with the consent of the Eastern and General Syndicate, assigned its rights to the Standard Oil Company of California under the above option, and the latter company, in turn, organized a Canadian subsidiary to hold and operate the con cession. Under the terms of the option contract it would appear that the Eastern and General Syndicate undertook to secure from the Colonial Office a renewal of the concession for one year from the date of its expiry, December 2nd, 1928. The Colonial Office, however, when approached in October 1928 by the syndicate made its approval of a renewal contingent upon the insertion in the original concession agreement of a clause providing, j - ri1: ' er 'that the concessionaires should be a British registered company; furthermore, that the managing(9 managing director and the majority of the other directors should be British subjects, and that foreigners should not control directly or indirectly any of the rights and privileges granted in the concession by the Sheik of Bahrein. The holding or operation of the concession by a company directly or indirectly controlled by Americans would effectually be excluded by the insertion of such a clause in the agreement.

Sir, The question of the disposal of the oil concession in the Bahrein Islands, which was dealt with in your memorandum of April 5rd, and in subse quent semi-official correspondence with this department, has engaged the attention of His Majesty's Government. 2. I now have the honour to inform you that His Majesty's Government are prepared in principle to consent to the participation of United States interests in this concession, subject to their being satisfied as to the conditions on which United otcites capital will participate, and in particular as to the nationality of the operating company, of its chairman and directors, and of the personnel who will be employed in the Islands. His Majesty's Government would suggest that these conditions should form the subject of direct discussion between representatives of the Eastern and General Syndicate, as being the existing concessionnaires, and the Colonial Office. 3. With regard to the oral request which you made on April 3rd to a member of this department i for a statement of the policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to the holding and operation in territoriesin territories such as the Bahrein Islands, of petroleum concessions by foreigners, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty f s Government feel bound to reserve to themselves the right to consider on its merits, and in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time, each proposal for the holding or operation of petroleum consessions by foreigners in such territories, and that they therefore find themselves unable to make any general statement of their policy on this question such as the United States Government desire. I have, etc., (For the Secretary of State). (Signed).(S 69035/29. 50th May, 1929. Sir, I am directed by Mr.Secretary Amery to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter (H.A./S.F,) of the 22nd of April and to inform you that, as a result of further consideration, His Majesty^ Government are prepared in principle to consent to the participation of United States interests in the oil concession in the Bahrein Islands subject to their being satisfied as to the conditions on which United States capital will participate, and in particular as to the nationality of the operating Company, of its chairman and directors, and of the personnel who will be employed in the Islands. 2. I am to suggest that the conditions governing the admission of United States capital should form the subject of discussion between representatives of your Syndicate and of the Oolonial Office and to say that a further letter in this regard will be addressed to you in due course, I am, etc., (S i gne d) 0.G.R.WILLIAMS. The Secretary, Eastern and General Syndicate Limited.An Interdepartmental Oonferenoe was held at the Colonial Office on Friday, 7th June, 1929, to consider the question of what conditions should govern the participation of United States capital in the operation of the Concession granted 'by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndics,te Limited, for tne exploitation of oil in the Bahrein Islands. There were present:- Mr.C.G.R. Williams (in the Chair). ) Lr.H.G, Bushe. ) Colonial Mr,J.H.Hall. ) Office, Mr.W.J,Bigg ) Lord Monteagle. ) Er.G.Jehb. ) Foreign Mr.G.H.Thomson. ) Office, Mr•J.G.Laithwaite. India Office. Mr.H.R .W .Giffard, Petroleum Department. The Chairman explained briefly the events which had led up to the calling of the Conference, and the questions which had to be considered. Mr.Bushe stated that it seemed desirable in the first instance to consider upon what grounds Kis Majesty's Government were entitled to impose conditions upon the participation of United States capital in the operation of the Concession. The Concession held by the Syndicate provided for the grant to that Company of an exploration licence entitling the Company to the exclusive right, for a period not exceeding two years from the 2nd of December, 1925, to explore for oil throughout the whole of the territories controlled by the Sheikh. That licence, which expired on the 1st of December,■of December, 1927, had, in accordance with the provisions of the Concession, been renewed for a further period of one year. In October, 1928, the Syndicate had submitted to the Colonial Office an application for the renewal of their exploration licence for a further period of one year from the 2nd of December, 1928. The Syndicate were informed that if they would give an undertaking in specified terms which would ensure that the operation of the Concession would at all times be and remain under British control, His Majesty 1 s Government would be prepared to recommend the Sheikh of Bahrein to grant the Syndicate the renewal desired. The Syndicate, however, had already entered into an agreement with certain American interests for the transfer of their rights under the Concession to American control, and were not, therefore, prepared to give the undertaking desired by His Majesty's Government. The renewal asked for by the Syndicate was, in consequence, not granted and their exploration licence duly expired on the 1st of December, 1928. Negotiations with His Majesty's Government had, how ever, been continued by the Syndicate, in the hope that, notwithstanding the fact that their rights under the Concession had passed into American control, His Majesty's Government would feel able to recommend the Sheikh to renew the exploration licence for a further period of one year. Subsequently, the local Agent of the Syndicate had asked that the sum of Rs.10,000 which.he had paid to the Sheikh of Bahrein on the 2nd of December, 1928,)r 1928, in anticipation of the renewal of the exploration licence, should, if that renewal was not granted, be utilised in payment for a prospecting licence to run from that date. In the Concession granted to the Syndicate by the Sheikh, the latter undertook fl on behalf of himself and his successors, to grant to the Syndicate on application, either after the expiry of t or during the course of n the period of the exploration licence or any extension or renewal thereof granted to the Syndicate, a prospecting licence in respect of certain areas in Bahrein to be selected 'by the Syndicate. The rights of the Syndicate at the present time appeared to depend mainly upon the interpretation to be placed upon the words H after the expiry of. 51 If these words were interpreted to mean that, 'at any time' after the expiry of their exploration licence, the Syndicate had the right to demand from the Sheikh or his successors the grant of a prospecting licence, which carries the right to a mining lease in the terms in the Schedule, the position would be that the Sheikh was for all time estopped from allowing any other person or persons to prospect for oil in his territories until the Syndicate had applied for and obtained the grant of a prospecting licence and had selected the areas in Bahrein to which that licence was to apply. This would mean that the Syndicate would be in a pssition to hold up indefinitely the development of Bahrein which was a reductio ad absiirdum . In Mr.Bushe ! s view, having regard to the terms of the Concession as a whole, the onlyonly reasonable and therefore the proper interpretation to be placed upon the words 'on application either after the expiry of or during the course of the period of the exploration licence' was 'on application during the period of the exploration licence or upon its expiry.' If that were so it could be argued that the exploration licence granted to the Syndicate had expired on the 1st of December, 1928, and had not so far been extended or renewed, and that as the Syndicate had not applied either before or upon that date for the grant of a prospecting licence, they were not now entitled to claim such a licence and their Concession had lapsed. In that case it might be said that His Majesty's Government were in a position to impose upon the Syndicate any conditions which they might wish before agreeing to recommend tne Sheikh to renew the Syndicate's exploration licence ior a further period of one year from the 2nd of December, 1928, If the Syndicate refused to accept these conditions and claimed, in accordance with the terms of their Concession, that the question should be referred to arbitration, the position of the Sheikh and of His Majesty's Government in the matter could however, in Mr.Bushe's view, hardly be said to be unassailable. Although there was no express provision in the Concession which would entitle the Sheikh to refuse to agree to the renewal of the exploration licence merely because the Syndicate's rights under the Concession had been transferred to American interestsinterests, it would, in Mr,Bushed view, be possible to contend that the Concession had been granted to a particular British Company and that the Sheikh was under no obligation to grant an exploration licence to the American interests to which the Syndicated rights under the Concession had been transferred# This contention was, however, of doubtful expediency as it would be possible for the rights under the Concession to remain in the Syndicate which could be reconstructed so that its control became American. Mr•Bus he suggested, therefore, that it should be explained to the Syndicate that their exploration licence had expired on the 1st of December, 1928, and that, in the absence of any extension or renewal of that licence, they were not entitled to claim the grant of a prospecting licence as their Concession had ^lapsed, but that if they were prepared to agree to the conditions which His Majesty 1 s Government wished to impose upon the introduction of American capital into the operation of the Concession, His Majesty 1 s Government would be prepared to recommend the Sheiltfi to renew their exploration licence for a period of one year, from the 2nd of December, 1928. This renewal, if granted, would enable the Syndicate to apply in due course for the grant of a prospecting licence. This suggestion was agreed to. It was suggested that the Syndicate might contend that their Concession made no provision for the introduction of the conditions which His Majesty's Government had sought to impose, and that as it was onlyonly the desire of His Majesty's Govermnent to impose these conditions upon the Syndicate which had prevented their being granted the renewal for which they had applied, they were still entitled to claim that renewal. Mr.Bushe considered, ho?v'ever, that in that event it would be possible for His Majesty's Government to take the line that the Syndicate had not established that the renewal for which they had applied was justified on its merits, but that nevertheless, His Majesty's Government were prepared, if the Syndicate would accept the conditions referred to, to recommend the Sheikh to grant the renewal for which the Syndicate had asked. The question of what conditions should govern the participation of American capital in the operation of the Concession was then considered. Mr.Laithwaite stated that the India Office thought that the conditions imposed should be as stringent as possible, in order that the operation of the Goncession m might remain as far as possible under British control. The Colonial Office and Foreign Office representatives ? A however, pointed out that, having regard to the terms^ of the Note which had been addressed by the Foreign Office to the American Embassy, it was not now possible to do more than to provide for the retention . of a British element in the directing and operating (Here insert ) ^ B (paragraph sug ) - Staff. After some discussion it was agreed that (gested inMo.76.) ^ the conditions to be imposed by the Syndicate should be as follows:- (a) The Company to be formed to take over the Concession to be and remain a British Company registered in Great Britain; (b) The(j9 (b) the Chairman and the Managing Director (if any) of the Company to be at all times British subjects; ^ c ^ a P5 0 P 0r ^i 0 P the Directors (between, say ^-92% and 33 /3?o), to be agreed upon between the parties, to be at all times British subjects; and (d) the local General Manager of the Company and the whole of the local Staff, with certain exceptions to be agreed upon between the parties, to be at all times British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein, It was agreed that these suggested conditions should be communicated officially to the interested Departments for concurrence before they were communicated to the Syndicate, The question of the attitude to be adopted by His Majesty's Government in the event of American interests desiriqgto participate in the development of oil in Kuwait was then considered, as this question was likely to arise as soon as the questions outstanding in regard to the Syndicate's Oil Concession in Bahrein had been disposed of. It was pointed out that the position in Kuwait differed from that in Bahrein in that Kuwait had been excluded from the scope of the agreement concluded between the various groups comprising the Turkish Petroleum Company, and that no Concession for the development of oil in Kuwait had yet been granted, though an application for such a Concession had been submitted by the Eastern ana General Syndicate. It was generally agreed that it would be desirable to resist the introduction of American interests into Kuwait, and it was suggested that, if and when a convenient opportunity presented itself, Sir J.Cadman might be sounded as to the possibility of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company applying for an Oil Concession in that territory.&amp; Mr.Janson and Major Holmes of the Eastern and General Syndicate called to see Sir John Shuckburgh on Friday the 19th of July. Mr.Williams, Mr.Bushe and Mr.Bigg were present during the interview. The representatives of the Syndicate explained the reasons which had led them to transfer to American interests the rights which they possess in virtue of their agreement with the Shaikh of Bahrein. The Syndicate themselves had spent over £50,000 in exploring for oil in Bahrein and their American friends had, it was estimated, spent a further £15,000 on the same object. The Syndicate had come to the end of their resources and although they had explored every possible avenue they had been unable to obtain assistance from British capitalists to enable them to exploit their Concession. ^hey had therefore been forced to obtain assistance from American oil interests and in return had transferred to those interests their rights under the Concession granted to them by the Shaikh of Bahrein. In transferring those rights they had made certain stipulations, which they had anticipated would be acceptable to His Majesty's Government, to ensure that those rights should be exercised by a British Company, and, in fact, the American oil interests concerned had already registered in Canada a Company formed for the express purpose of continuing the operation of the Concession. At no stage during the course of the discussion did the representatives of the Syndicate attemptli ] attempt to dispute the right of His Majesty f s Government or the Shaikh of Bahrein to impose conditions upon the participation of American capital in the operation of the Concession or upon the transfer to American oil interests of the rights conferred by the Concession. It was therefore unnecessary to make use of the various arguments referred to in the recent correspondence with the other interested Departments of His Majesty 1 s Government, though it is, of course, possible that when the Syndicate came to talk to their American friends about the conditions which His Majesty^ Government aesire to impose, those American interests will raise the question. v/hen informed of the conditions upon which His Majesty's Government would be prepared to advise the Shaikh of Bahrein to agree to the participation of American capital in the operation of the Concession the representatives of the Syndicate were at first doubtful of their ability to induce their American friends to accept those conditions. After further discussion, however, the representatives of the Syndicate came round to the view that the conditions proposed were on the whole not unreasonable, Mr. Jans on at first considered that, havin^: regard to the fact that the American oil interests concerned had already registered a Company in Canada for the express purpose of the operation of the Concession in Bahrein, they would oppose the suggestion that a Company should be registered in this&amp; this country. He eventually agreed, however, that the proposal was not unreasonable and undertook to endeavour to secure its acceptance by his American friends. Both Mr.Janson and Major Holmes considered that it would be difficult, if, indeed, not impossible, to secure the assent of their American friends to the suggestion that the local General Manager and the whole of the local staff, with certain exceptions to be agreed upon between the parties, should be at all times British subjects or subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrein. American oil magnates had a very low opinion of British directing staff and were likely to desire to employ American subjects as their local technical staff. Their American friends attached such importance to the retention in the hands of American engineers of the control of the technical work to be carried out in Bahrein that, although they might be prepared to agree to the appointment of a British subject as their local General Manager, they were unlikely to agree that more than a small proportion of their local technical staff should be British subjects. Insistence on the acceptance of the condition proposed might result in the refusal of their American friends to participate in the operation of the Concession with the result that the oil resources of Bahrein would not at present be exploited. After some discussion the representatives of the Syndicate agreed that if the condition in question could be amended by the omission of the words n the whole of the local staff, wi th'&amp; with certain exceptions to be agreed upon between the partiesand the insertion in lieu of the words n as many of the local staff as is consistent with the efficient carrying out of the undertaking' they would do their utmost to induce their American friends to accept the conditions proposed. Sir John Shuckburgh agreed to the amendment suggested. It was agreed that the Colonial Office should \ rite to the Syndicate setting out the conditions which it wss proposed should govern the participation of Aimerican capital in the operation of the concession and that the byndicate would then endeavour to secure the assent of the American oil interests concerned to those conditions and report the result of their negotiations to the Colonial Office in due course. Mr.Jans on an d Maj or H olmes we re info rme d tha t it ..as unlikely that His Majesty*3 Government would oe prepared to consent to any further modification of the conditions proposed, to which considerable importance was attached by other interested Departments of His Majesty's Government and it was agreed that if the Syndicate were unable to induce their American friends to accept those conditions the whole question should then be made the subject of further discussion at the Colonial Off ice. Colonial Office. 20th July, 1929.Mr.Jans on and Major Holmes of the Eastern and General Syndicate called to see Sir John Shuckburgh on Wednesday, 31st July. Mr.Williams, Mr.Bushe and Mr.Hall were present at the interview. Sir John Shuckburgh explained that as a result of the discussion held on the 19th July with representatives of the Syndicate, a letter was prepared in the Colonial Office communicating the conditions upon which H.M.G. would be prepared to advise the Sheikh of Bahrein to agree to the extension of the exploration licence granted to the Syndicate and to the Assignment of their Concession. This letter was on the point of being despatched to the Syndicate when Mr.Janson telephoned to ask that the despatch of the letter should be postponed pending a further discussion. It was in accordance with this request that the present Meeting had been called. Mr.Janson explained that since the Meeting of the 19th July he and Major Holmes had had an opportunity to discuss with Major Davis, the represen tative of the American group holding the option on the Syndicate's Concession, the conditions which H.M.G. wished to impose as disclosed at that Meeting. He had ascertained from Major Davis that his principals took the following view in regard to the four proposed cond itions:- (a) They were not prepared to agree to the registration in Great Britain of the Company formed to operate the Concession. They had already formed a Company for that purpose in Canada, which, as being within easy reach of their(3 viC- their headquarters in the United States, could be controlled therefrom. They contemplated that the Directorships of the new Company should, for the most part, be filled by the appointment of Directors of their o\m group, who, for the purpose of Board Meetings, could, without undue inconvenience, travel to Canada. They had no organisation in this country,which would enable them to operate a Company in London. To do so, therefore, would involve the setting up of a special organisation for the purpose. Another objection was that the taxation of Companies registered in this country was extremely heavy, much more so than in Canada. (b) They, were not prepared to agree that the Chairman and Managing Director of the new Company should at all times be a British subject. It was their intention that the Chairman of the group in America should also officiate as Chairman of the new ...ompany, and that the Managing Director (if any) should also be one of the Directors or Officials already associated with the American group, (c) Of the five Directors contemplated, they were only prepared to agree that one should be a British subject. As they were providing the whole capital for the enterprise, they considered it essential that full control■oontroi should rest in the hands of their group. (d) They were not prepared to agree that the local Manager in charge of the Company's operations in Bahrein should at all times be a British subject, although they were willing to appoint a British subject to act as Liaison Officer and to be . employed for all negotiations with the Sheikh of Bahrein and with the local population. He would, however, be subject to the authority of the local Manager who would be a technical official in charge of the Field operations of the Company. It would be entirely opposed to their organisation to appoint a non—technical Manager. Sir John Shuckburgh pointed out that in their counuer proposals the American group in effect rejected all the conditions proposed by H . I vu G -, except to the extent of the admission of one Bxicioh uirector to the Board of the Company. He felt some doubt whether the Syndicate's American associates fully appreciated the position. Without H .M.G-.'s good will and support they could not obtain or work this Concession at all. As the price of that good will, H.M .G .had laid down certain entirely reasonable conditions. These, he was satisfied, represented the minimum requirements of H.U .G. The fourth condition, that in regard to the appointment of a British local Manager, was as much in thein the interest of the Company as of K.M. G. , although the latter attached the greatest possible importance to this condition. Possibly the American group did not realise that had it not been for the services rendered by Great Britain in the Persian Gulf during the last hundred years, there could have been no question today of working an oil concession in those areas. This country, by sacrifice of men and money, had made the Gulf safe for enterprises of this character, and they had every right to impose such conditions on the conduct of commercial enterprises in those regions as they considered necessary in the furtherance of their policy of pacification and the promotion of prosperity in the Gulf States. ;-r.Janson said that all this had been explained to the American group on more than one occasion, but that they apparently felt that as they were providing all the capital they should 'call the tune.» Sir John Bhuckburg;h asked to which of the four conditions the Americans attached the greatest importance. Hr.Janson replied that undoubtedly his American associates attached the greatest importance to condition (d). He thought it possible \ that if this could be settled to the satisfaction of botn parties the remaining three conditions could be disposed of with less difficulty. The Americans apparently had a very low opinion of the managerial abilities of British subjects. They regarded the control of the local operations as the vital considera- j tion in the successful production of oil, and they were notnot prepared that this control should be delegated to either a British subject or to a person without the highest technical qualifications. Their local Manager must, in their opinion, be an official in whoa they had full confidence. They were aware of no British subject who would satisfy this requirement. Major Holmes asked whether it would satisfy H.M.G, if it were laid down that no representative of the Company should approach the Shaikh except through the British Political Agent at Bahrein. Sir John Shuckbur^h said that it was essential that a British subject should be the chief local representative of the Company. He must be the Company's 'Number One' in Bahrein. It was, he thought, a matter of indifference to H.M.G. whether or not he had. any control over the technical operations of the Company. The relations between the British Manager and the official in charge of the technical operations was a matter of internal arrangement within the Company, and one with which H.M.G-. were not concerned. But it was, from their point of view, essential that the Company's official charged with responsibility for all dealings with the Sheikh and the local authorities should be a British subject and should, nominally at least, be the Chief local representative of the Company, He would have thought that such an arrangement was in the interest of the Company themselves. H.M.G. would, he thought, be perfectly satisfied if Major Holmes were appointed as the Company's local ManagerManager at Bahrein. If the American group were so averse from agreeing to the principle of the appointment of a British subject, could it nob be mutually agreed Lhat Major Holmes should be the first local General Manager, and that the appointment of his successor should be subject to the approval of H.M.G. Major Holmes said that, for his part, he would be prepared to accept the post,and he thought it possible that SLich an appointment would be acceptable to the American groiip. In conversations which he had had with Mr.Wallace, who virtually controlled the American group, he gathered that he had won the latter^ confidence. Indeed Mr. Wallace had on one occasion pressed him to take up an important appointment on behalf of the group in Venezuela. It was finally agreed that the Syndicate should tentative!}? suggest to their American associates the adoption of the following variant of condition (d), and ascertain whether it would be acceptable. They would make it clear that this variant had not been accepted by H.H.G. and courd not be so accepted without further reference to the interested Government Departments:- 'There shall at all times be a local General Manager who shall be approved by His Majesty's Government. He shall be the Chief Representative of the Company in Bahrein and shall be responsible for all relations with the local authorities and population. All communication with the Sheikh on behalf of the Company, shall be through the British Political Agent. For the first five years after the inception of the enterprise the local General Manager shall be Major Holmes. 11 In the course of the discussion, it was mentioned to the Syndicated representatives that H.M.G,&amp; H.M.G, would require an assurance from the Syndicate that no steps would be taken which would prejudice the position of the proposed site for the landing ground and sea-plane station, the precise location of #iich would be communicated to them in the near future. The Syndicate's representatives said that they did not anticipate any difficulty with their American associates on this score, and they promised to mention the matter to the latter at an early date. It was agreed that in any letter sent to the Syndicate setting out the conditions governing the Assignment of the Concession, a clause to the above effect should be inserted. It was agreed that a further Meeting between representatives of the Colonial Office and of the Syndicate should be held on Thursday, the 8th of August at 3.30 p.m.I sBsssmaas memorandum MOTE OF CONFERENCE WITH EASTERN AND GENERAL SYNDICATE. 8TI-I AUGUST. 1929 . As arranged on the 51st of July, a further meeting was held at the Colonial Office on Thursday, the 8th of August, 'between Mr. Jans on and Major Holmes, of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and Sir John Shuckburgh. Mr•Williams, Mr»Hall and Mr.Bigg were also present. Mr.Janson handed to Sir John Shuckburgh a summary, which had been received from New York by telegram, of the comments made by the American group upon the proposals put forward on behalf of His Majesty's. Government at the meetings held on the 19th and 31st of July. This summary, which was practically identical with the views expressed by Mr.Janson on the 31st of July, read as follows:- (a) A Canadian company is essential on account of taxation and easy location for Managing Director to attend Board Meetings. (b) The Managing Director and/or Chairman cannot be British, as Americans are providing all the capital and the Gulf Oil Company have no Foreign representatives on any of their Boards. (c) The Americans agree one Director to be British out of five, but he may only hold his qualification shares. (d) TheV p- (d) The Americans agree that a person satisfact ory to the British G-overnment would be employed with title of Special Delegate Special Agent Foreign Representative or Special Representative of the company, who would directly handle with the Sheikhs under consultation with the British Political Agent all matters of business nature necessary to be taken up with the Sheikhs and also all matters oi Political or Diplomatic nature to be taken up with the Sheikhs, in all such business matters such . . .. would be guided by advice and suggestions of Local Manager of the Company, but as respect all Political or Diplomatic matters involving policy such would be guided by advice and suggestions of the Home Office of the Parent owning Company. (e) The Americans agree that as many British shall be employed in the Company as consistent with the efficient working of the property. Sir John Shuckburgh again warned the representatives of the Syndicate that no modification of the conditions communicated to them on the 19th of July could be agreed to without consultation with the other interested Departments of His Majesty^ Government, and that any modification tentatively agreed upon in the course of the present conversations I a a flconversations would have to be referred to those Departments for concurrence. In Sir John Shuckburgh 1 s view, condition (d) was the most important condition, both from the point of view of the American group and from that of His Majesty's Government, and this condition was therefore discussed in the first instance * Mr.Janson explained that the American group had not felt able to accept in its entirety the variant of this condition proposed at the Meeting of the 31st of July. They had expressed their readiness to agree to the appointment of Major Holmes as their local representative in Bahrein for the purpose of conducting business with the Sheikh of Bahrein, in consultation with the Political Agent, but they Y/ere not prepared to confer upon him the title of Local General Manager or Manager, or to allow him to control in any way the technical operations of the Company in Bahrein; nor were they prepared at this stage to conclude a contract with Major Holmes for a period of five years, as, until they had commenced operations in Bahrein and had ascertained that oil was to be found there in commercially payable quantities, they were not in a position to say whether their operations in Bahrein would extend over so long a period as five years. Sir John Shuckburgh stated that he appreciated why the American group were unwilling at this stage to give Major Holmes a definite appointment f or afor a period of five years, hut that, while the position might be reasonable in so far as related Co Major Holmes, it could not be said to be satisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty's Government. In his view it was essential to make it clear that Major Holmes, or whoever else was appointed with the approval of His Majesty's Government as the local representative of the Company for the purpose of their relations with the local authorities in Bahrein, was the chief representative of the Company in Bahrein, and was the only representative of the Company who was empowered to deal with those authorities. It was also essential that his appointment should for a definite period of five years in the first instance, or for such lesser period as the Company might continue to conduct its operations in Bahrein. If the Company discontinued operations the need for the appointment obviously ceased; but it was necessary to provide against a different contingency, viz:- that the Company might, at an early stage in the proceedings, and without any question arising of a discontinuance of operations, remove the representative approved by His Majesty's Government and invite our concurrence in the appointment of a successor about whose suitability it might be difficult for us to satisfy ourselves. It was as much in the interests of the Companjr as of His Majesty's Govern ment that the chief local representative of the Company should be persona ^rata with His Majesty's Government, and also with the local autharitfesin. Bahrein. ''Wey We oelieve that five years experience would suffice fully to convince the Company of this, ana to satisfy them that it was desirable, in their own interests, to continue to employ a suitable Bribisn subject as their chief local representative in Bahrein. Sir John Shuclcburgh did not think that unere was anj' need for the chief local representative of the Company to control their technical operations in Bahrein; the question of his relations with the official in charge of the technical operations was entirely a matter for the Company, which need nou be mentioned in the conditions governing the assignment of the Concession. After some discussion it was agreed that condition (d) might be redrafted to make it clear that Major Holmes should be appointed as the chief local representative of the Company in Bahrein, and that the company should be under an oblige-ti on to Kis Majesty's Government to employ him in that capacity for a period of five years in the first instance, or for such lesser period as the Company were operating in Bahrein, and that he should be one only official of the Company who was empowered to deal with the local authorities and population in Bahrein. It was also agreed that the Colonial Oifice snould furnish the Syndicate with a reasoned explanation of the circumstances which rendered it essential to impose this condition. As regards the remaining conditions, it was agreed that in all the circumstances, the contention of thethe Amerisan group that they should not be required to register a fresh Company in this country, might be regarded as reasamble; and it was suggested as an alternative that, if Kis Majesty's G-overnrnent agreed that the Company formed to take over the concession should remain registered in Canada, the Company on their part should agree to maintain a registered agency in this country which should at all times be in charge of a British subject, who should be the recognised channel of communication between the Company and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, It was also agreed that if the Company was to remain registered in Canada and to be presided over by the Chairman of the American group as was proposed, it would be difficult for His Majesty's Government to^insist that the Chairman and the Managing Director (if any) of the Company should be British subjects. It was suggested, however, that if His Majesty's Government agreed to waive this condition, and to the appointment of one British Director only out of five as proposed by the American group instead of the larger proportion originally proposed, the American group should be requested to agree that the British member of the Board of Directors of the Company should be nominated by His Majesty's Government in Canada in consultation with His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and that his salary as Director should be provided by the Company. With regard to the question of the local employeesemployees of the Company other than their chief representative in Bahrein, it was agreed that the fornmla originally suggested by the Colonial Office was preferable to the alternative suggested by the American group, and should be insisted upon. It was agreed that the Colonial Office should endeavour to obtain the concurrence of the other interested Departments of His Majesty's G-ovemment in the revised conditions now proposed, and, when this had been done, should communicate those conditions to the Syndicate by letter with a full explanation of the reasons which rendered / necessary insistence upon condition (d). The representatives of the Syndicate expressed the hope that if, as appeared to be the case, the modification tentatively suggested represented the extreme limit of the concessions which His Majesty's Government were prepared to make, it would be made clear in the letter communicating the revised conditions that His Majesty's Government would not be prepared to consider any further modifications of those conditions. The representatives of the Syndicate considered that, if this was done, ^ their task of endeavouring to induce the American group to accept those conditions would be facilitated. The representatives of the Syndicate did not consider that any useful purpose would be served by further negotiation with Major Davis in this country. 4 They therefore proposed to inform him generally of the result of their conversations at the .Colonial Office, and to explain that no further progress could be madebe made in the matter until the other interested Departments of His Majesty's Government, and possibly also the Government of India, had been consulted, and that some further delay was therefore inevitable. They hoped that in the circumstances Major Davis would return to the United States to report to his Principals. In any case, Mr.Jans on and Major Holmes proposed, on receipt of the promised letter from the Colonial Office, themselves to proceed to the United States in order to negotiate direct with Mr.Wallace, the Chairman of the American group; and they anticipated that, with the explanations to be furnished by the Colonial Office and with those which they themselves would be able to provide, they would find it possible to secure Mr.Wallace*5 acceptance of the conditions proposed. It was also agreed that the Colonial Office letter communicating the revised conditions should stipulate that no steps would be taken by the Syndi cate or the American group which would prejudice the position of the proposed sites for a landing ground and sea-plane station in Bahrein, the precise location of which would be communicated to the Syndicate as soon as possible.3n &lt; c/ 3^ 69035/29 Downing Street /^September, 19^9 %- : f^\ /ES /- Sir, X am directed 'by Lord Passfield to refer to the oonrereatioas with Mr. Janson and Major Holmes which took place at the Colonial Office on the 8th of August last, ani to inform you that His Majesty's GoTerament have hai under consideration the question oi the conditions zpon which they would be prepared to advise the Shaikh of Bahrein further to extend the period of the ssploration licence granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate in yirtue of the Agreement concluded betv/een the Syndicate and the Shaikh on the 2nd if December, 1925 and to agree to the aasigmaent of jhe Syndicated rights under that Agreement to a new Oanpany controlled by American interests., !I!h08e conditions are as follows:- fs.} 1/iat the Company x'ormed to t® ke over the Concession from the Syndicate shall be and remain a British.

Co.to you herewith# His Majesty's Government note that the G.S. Eastern (Julf Oil Company consider that, except in so far as the specific points referred to in their letter of the 24th of Octoher are concerned, the conditions set out in Colonial Office letter of the 16th of September last are generally satisfactory. 2. As regards the specific points referred to in the Eastern Gulf Oil Company's letter of the 24th of October, I am to make tie following observations:- (l) Having regard to the considerations referred to in the seventh paragraph of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company's letter of the 24thof October, His Majesty's Government are prepared to recognise the right of the Company to have a voice in the designation and election of the British member of the Board of Directors, and to agree that condition (b), referred to in paragraph 1 of Colonial Office letterof the 16th of September last should be amended to read as follows;- *(b) That of the five Directors of the Company one Director shall at all times be a British subject who shall be persona grata to His Majesty's^ajesty^s QpTemmant. His selection for appointment as Director shall \&gt;e raade in conaultation witli His Majesty^s Government, and his salary as Director shall be provided by the Company 1 , (2) His Majesty^ Government do not regard the proposed additionto condition (c) as entirely satisfactory. They would, however, be prepared to agree to the addition suggested by the Bastern Gulf Oil Company subject to the addition of the following furtherproviso - 'Provided also that any sooner determination of the appointment of Major Holmes shall be subject to the consent of His Majesty's Government, which shall not be unreasonably withheld (3) If the las tern Gulf Oil Company are prepared to agree to the two amendments suggested above. His Majesty's Government will be prepared to advise the Sheikh of Bahrein to extend to the 2nd of December, 1930, the period of the Exploration Licence granted to the Syndicate. It should be understood, however, that this extension would not affect the periods specified in'the agreement of the 2nd of December,1925, as those for Which a Prospecting Licence and Mining Lease could be granted, and that the further extension proposed would. If granted. Involve the payment to the Sheikh of a sum Hs.10 ,000 in respect of the year ending on the 2nd of December 1930. (4) As regards the suggested amendment of the last sentence of paragraph 4 of Colonial Office letter of the 16th of September last, I am to point out that failure on the part of the Carapany to,observe certain of the conditions set out in the first paragraph of that letter could not be remedied even afterth# lapse of a reasonable time. It should, howev er fhowever, be understood that the Company would he allowed a raasonafcle time in which to appoint a British monber of the Board of Directorg, or a Chief Leoal Representative in Bahrein, in the event of either of those posts falling vacant, and if the Sastem Oulf Oil Company so desire, His Majesty's Oovsmmsnt are prepared to agree to the 4th paragraph of the Colonial Office letter of the 16th of September last being amsn'ed by the addition thereto of the following words 'it being understood that a reasonable tine shall be allowed to elapse for the replacement of the British Direotor or the Chief local Reprssentativs in the event of either of those posts falling vacant *. His Hajesty's Government are, however. Jnable to agree to the suggestion that, in the event of a breach of the conditions prescribed, the Concession should not be cancelled but should revert to the JJastern and General Syddioate. His Majesty's Government are not prepared to eentervplate a partial or United aesi-nnent of the Concession. Any ass.gmsnt now nade must be final and complete and in such form aa to cause the assignees to bo definitely aubstituted for your Syndicate ae regards the enjoyment of all benefits and the performance of all obligationa under the Conceasion. Hio Majesty's Government are not concerned with the financial arrangements contemplated between your Syndicate and the lastem Gulf oil Company in connection with the proposed assignment, and the question of safeguarding the continuing royalty mentioned in the Company's letter under reference, or of providing financial compensation in lieu thereof, is one for settlement between your Syndicate and the Eastern Gulf oil Company. A 8 regards the suggested extension of the concession to cover the whole of Bahrein. His Majesty's Government consider that this i. a separate question which could more properly be discussed when the questions relating to the existing concession have been disposed of. M. r . 0T . r . ^ , M&amp;jesty» sGovernment have not yet reao&amp;ed a decision on the subject of the proposed extension of the concession, and would not he prepared to take such a decision until they have had an opportunity of further consultation with the local authorities. In the circumstances, they feel sure that the Company would prefer that the two questions should be dealt with separately, - and that a settlement of the questions at issue regarding the existing concession should not be delayed until a decision could be taken on the subject of the extension of that ooncesaion, 3. It must be understood that His Majesty'a Oovemment are not prepared to accept any modifications, other than those indicated in the foregoing paragraphs, of the conditions proposed in Colonial Office letter of the 16th of 8«pt«mber,192&amp; and in the Sastern Sulf Oil Company's letter of the 34fctt of October,1929, His Majesty's Gtovarnment would accordingly ua glad to be informed in due course whether the Bastem Sulf Oil Company are prepared to accept these conditions with the modifications indicated above.

His Majesty's Government are not concerned with the financial arrangements contemplated between your Syndicate and the Eastern Gulf Oil Company in connection with the proposed assignment, and the question of safeguarding the continuing royalty mentioned in the Company's letter bjidei rexe ence, or of providing financial compensation in lieu thereof, is one for settlement between your Syndicate and the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. (5) As regards the suggested extension of the concession to cover the whole of Bahrein, His Majesty's Government consider tiiat this is a separate question which could more properly be discussed when the questions relating to the existing concession have been disposed of. No decision has yet been reached by His Majesty's Government in regard ^ 9.ppli cat ion rnade by your Syndicate for such an extension. It is probable that further consultation with th( local authorities will be necessary before a decision is reached on the subject, and, while His Majesty's Government cannot indicate the line which their decision is likely to take, it would be unwise to assume that it will necessarily be favourable. In these circumstances, further delay must be anticipated, and His Majesty's Government feel that the Company will agree v/ith them that, from their point of view also, it is preferable that the two matters should be dealt with separately, and that a settlement of the questions at issue regarding the existing concession should not be delayed until a decision can be taken on the subject of its extension. It must be understood that His Majesty's Government are rep are d to accept any modifications, other than those indicatedindicated in the foregoing paragraphs, of the conditions proposed ir, rmnnial Office letter of the 16th of September, 1929, and in the Eastern G^f Oil Company's letter of the 24th of October i Q29 His Male sty's Govemnent vfould accordingly oe glad oe in formed in due course whether the Eastern Gulf Oil Company are prepared to accept these conditions with the -^odifioations indicated above. If the Company are prepared to agree to t^ose modifications His Majesty 's Government would be glad to be furnished with a draft of the proposed formal assignment o* We rights of the Eastern and Genez^/il Syndicate to the propoe- new Company.

You will have learned from my Confidential despatch of the 6th of January of the stage reached in the negotia tions with the Syndicate on the subject of the assign ment of their rights in Bahrein to American interests, until those negotiations are completed it will not be possible to say what payments will be due from the Syndicate to the Shaikh of Bahrein, but i assume that the payment of Rs.10,000/- referred to above has been made by the Syndicate in anticipation of the satisfac tory conclusion of the negotiations and the extension, until the 2nd of December, 1930, of the Licence to explore for oil in Bahrein. 2. 1 shall of course keep you informed of the progress of the negotiations.

I am directed to inform you that on the 27th ultimo this Syndicate cabled instructions to the Eastern Bank at Bahrein to pay to the Consolidated Fund of the Bahrein State Government the sum of 10,000 Rupees, being the yearly rental of the Bahrein Oil Concession, which was due on the 2nd instant. The Eastern Bank replied on the 2nd instant stating that the Bahrein Government had refused to accept this payment until they had received fuller information from us. The refusal of the Bahrein Government to accept the 10,000 Rupees is doubtless due to their knowledge of the questions which are at present in course of settlement between us and they will naturally expect advices from you before they will officially accept the renewal rental. I am therefore to say that my Directors assume, in view of the present state of the negotiations with you, that the delay by the Bahrein Government in accepting the rental will not in any way prejudice this Syndicate.

In Ms view a much simpler ®iid better procedure would be to leave the Colonial Office conditions in the correspondence, ihere was, he argued, no real need to recite those coaditloas in any formal document, or in any case in any document wnich the t&gt;haikh need sign, i'he Eastern uulf Oil Company could not, in any lace, work the Concession with any hope of success without the full support of ..is Majesty's Government, ihey could not expect to have Wit full support unless they scrupulously adhered to the conditions imposed by tne Colonial Office. Consequently, any breach of tnosje conditions would be directly against their own interests, and would provide its own penalty. 'iJhere was no need, therefore,to give the eihaikh a Concession in tne event of-ti breach of tne formal right to cancel the/Conditions, ite iioped that His Majesty's uovernaent would see their way to drop the proposal for a tripartite leed, and would be content to let the matter rest on the basis of the correspondence which had already been exchanged.

By the Agreement of 22nd December 1880 and the Exclusive Agreement of 13th March 1892, the Sheikh bound himself not to enter into an^ agreement or correspondence with any Governments other than His Majesty's Government ; not to allow the Agents of such Governments to reside within his territory without the assent of His Majesty's Government; and not to alienate, mortgage, or give for occupation any part of his territories save to His Majesty's Government. Responsibility for the protection o f foreigners in Bahrein may be regarded as having passed to His Majesty's Government as a corollary to these two Agreements. But the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have arisen in an active, form until 1900. In December of that year the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a German 'subject, Mr. Wonckhaus, intended to open a branch of his business in Bahrein. The Political Resident suggested that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between Bahreini subjects and Mr. Wonckhaus or his agent, the Assistant Political Agent should be instructed to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Sheikh. 3. The Government of India informed the Political Resident in reply that ' Mr. Wonckhaus being a foreigner and not a protected person, the Assistant Political Agent cannot claim any jurisdiction in such cases. Mr. Wonckhaus and his agent, if a foreigner and not a native Indian subject of His Majesty, must be regarded as liable in such cases to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. 'As, however, the Sheikh is bound, under treaty, not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without the consent of the British Lr. d. 4 May 1901, Government, it is expedient that the British representative should, as a ^ G 7 of L Des^^i matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to European foreigners in any of 9 May 1901 disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects, and, in the p - 614/0i - event of necessity, he should claim to protect all such foreigners as he would a British subject. I am to request that Mr. Gaskin may be instructed to this effect.' 1 he action taken by the Government of India was subsequently approved Secret Desp. to by His Majesty's Government. J- ^ 1 16 ' of 4. In June 1903, the question having arisen of the purchase by Mr. p '' 063 ' 01, Wonckhaus of certain premises in Bahrein which he had hitherto held on a temporary lease, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident as follows :—' In view ... of the belief which Mr. Wonckhaus is reported to hold that, in the event of his acquiring property,'he will not be amenable to local law, but will be subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of Courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consul or other representative of a foreign nation the right to enter into direct relations with Lr. fromg. of 1. to the Chief, and that, should any such official address the Chief, he should be PoLRes.,No.ii56E Jr referred to the British authorities. The position should also be clearly p. si'/os. 1903: explained to Mr. Wonckhaus.' 4371 75 3.309 5. Xo dispute involving' the question of jurisdiction over foreigners Lor. i, pp. 938-912. appears to have arisen in Bahrein until 1904. In 1004-5 two incidents affecting foreign subjects took place in the Islands. In the first of these, a German subject—an employee of Messrs. Wonckhaus—became involved in a biawl, m the couise of wlucli lie suffered personal injuries. .Failing, as lie thought, to secure adequate redress through the Political Agent, to'whoni toV r of n i PO No R 490 lllS fil ? t com P laint was addressed, Mr. Wonckhaus made representations to of 17 Dec.' 1904 : ' the German Consul at Basra, who addressed the Sheikh direct on the p. 293/05. subject. His Excellency, in reply, acknowledged the letter and added, I have now to inform you that this matter is before the British Government, and I cannot say anything on the subject.' The Foreign Office at a later stage insti noted the Charge d Affaires at Berlin that, should representations fo Dos of 5 Dec ' )e 11 ? a ^ e ^ ie patter by the German Government, he should state 1904, No P 261 : that it had been brought to the notice of Mis Majesty's Government, and that p. 3540/04. a British ship would be sent to Bahrein in order ihat an inquiry might be instituted. The German Government do not appear to have taken any ^G'or^No^i act ^ )n - |' le German Consul at Basra subsequently thanked the Political of 17 dbc.'i904, ' Resident 'for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles para. 26 : P.293/05. the Case.' G. In the second case (November 1904), an accidental quarrel having- arisen between a retainer of the Sheikh's nephew and a Persian, attacks were made upon Persian subjects in Bahrein. Apprehensive that the Sheikh would endeavour to deal with the case in the local Courts, they telegraphed for support to the Shah, and conversations took place between His Majesty's Minister and the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, as the result of which the latter telegraphed to the Persian community urging them to keep calm, as &lt;S I have had a long talk with the British Minister . . . and l am sure'he will p.293,05. take early steps to get the affairs settled and the culprit punished.' The Sheikh, however, adopted an uncompromising atiitnde on the question of jurisdiction, maintaining that he would not admit any interference ' in cases between Arabs and Persians, who were all Mohammedans,' and that they must go before the local Shara Courts, which, composed as they were of Sunnis, were unlikely to do justice to the Shi ah Persians. Argument proving unavailing, an ultimatum was presented to His Excellency. He accepted the demands of llis Majesty's Government, and though no specific reference to the point was made m the ultimatum, the jurisdiction of the 1 olitical Agent appears thenceforth to have been delinitely established, as a a matter of practice, in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. 7. Correspondence took place between 1908 and 1911 in regard to the preparation of an Order in Council to confer jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in the Islands on the Political Agent at Bahrein. It was decided that it was desirable to obtain a lormal request irom the Sheikh tnat he should be relieved of jurisdiction over foreigners. After discussion with the Political Agent, His Excellency addressed 'the latter on lOth July 1909, in the following terms:—' Alter compliments. It is not hidden irom you that I have had considerable trouble in many cases (that arose) in my territory in which foreigners were involved. For this reason I wish that I may not be held responsible in these cases, and I would be grateful to British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me. I mean that it (the British Government) should exercise authority in all cases in which the foreigners only are concerned, but not in other cases ; and in cases that occur between foreigners and my subjects, it is necessary that you and I should settle them jointly.' 8. The Political Resident remarked, with reference to the reservation contained in the concluding sentence of the Sheikh's letter, 'As its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the joint Court, and gives G?of r i.?Noli863, to feigners the same treatment that British subjects now receive, there seems d. 31 July 1909. ' no need for exception to be taken to it.' 9. The Sheikh subsequently represented that his letter of 10th July 1909, giving jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government, was intended only 'to cover subjects of recognised Powers and not the dependents of petty Arab potentates in Gulf, with some of whom he claimsto have speciiU arrangements providing for reciprocal acceptance of each others diiect-jurisdiction. I informed him that if he could produce Viceroy 's tel. to agreements, and if the other parties, on being referred to, acknowledged s p their validity, I thought we should be prepared to recognise them . . .' peating tel. from 6 In the light of the protest in question, the wording of the Draft Order in S 0 ™ 8 ;^ Council was amended to its present form, under which (Article 8 of the ' b ' 7 ' Oidei in Council of 191.3) the power conferred by the Order extends to the persons and matters following in so far as by Treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means. His Majesty has jurisdiction in relation to such persons, matters, and things, that is to say :— (1) British subjects as herein defined within the limits of this Order. (2j J' orelgners with respect to whom the Sheikh of Jjahi'ein has agreed until His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction btj His Majesty. (o) Bahrein subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners ; with the proviso that all cases wherein such Bahrein subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of this Order. (4) 1 he expression 'person to whom this Order applies' shall be construed in accordance with the above three sub-Articles. (5) 1 he property and all personal or proprietary rights and liabilities within the said limits of British subjects and of foreigners within sub-Article (2) and ol; Bahrein subjects within sub-Article (3), whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits of this Order. (6) British ships and ships belonging to foreigners within sub- Article {2) with their boats, and the persons and property on board thereof, or belonging thereto, being within the limits of this Order; provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not be exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High. Court in Lngland in the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships. (7) If any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country, State, or tribe have or have not been placed under the jurisdiction of l lis Majesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the Political Pesident, and a certilicate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the cjuestion and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.' 10. Part V of the Order, to which reference is made in Article 8 quoted above, deals with the important class of case, whether civil or criminal, in which the parties are respectively a Bahrein subject and a person to whom the Order applies. I he procedure laid down in it is as follows : — ' (a) Crhninal. Article 41.—(I) When a Bahrein subject desires to institute a complaint against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to institute a complaint against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall entertain the same, and may— (а) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, himself hear and determine it in his District Court, or (б) send it to the Joint Court, or (c) if tlie^ defendant is a Mahommedan, refer it to a Kazi for decision, sending a representative of the Agency to record briefly the proceedings. Such decision, when endorsed by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be considered as if it were that of the District Court. (2) ]\othing in this Article shall prevent the Political Resident from exercising the revisory powers possessed by him under Article 4 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated the 31st May 1861.* ' J * See para. 1 above.4 (b) Civil. Article 45.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to bring a suit against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to bring a suit against a Bahrein subject, the Poiitieal Agent shall admit the complaint, and (a) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, may hear and determine the suit in his District Court, or (b) may hear and determine it in a Joint Court, or (c) may refer it to the Majlis-el-Urf for decision, or (d) in cases between pearling-masters and divers, may refer it to the Salifah Court, or (c) with the consent ol the several parties, may refer the case to- one or more Arbitrators for settlement. (2) The judgment of the Joint Court or of the Majlis-el-Urf shall for all purposes be considered the same as if it were that of the District Court. (3) An appeal from the decision of the Salifah Court shall lie to the Political Agent acting in concert with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and in all Salifah cases their joint decision shall be final. (4) The award of the Arbitrator under Sub-Article 1 (c) shall be final, and shall not be open to appeal unless the same shall within a. reasonable time have been ordered by the Political Agent to be set aside on the ground that it is not final or is defective, or that the Arbitrator has exceeded his authority, or has been guilty of misconduct in the matter. _ (5) Nothing herein mentioned shall prevent the District Court, the Joint Court, the Majlis-el-Urf, the Salifah Court, or the Arbitrator from referring any matter in the progress of a suit which involves a point of Mahommedan law to a Kazi for decision, or from sending any party or witness, being a Mahommedan, to a Kazi for the administration of an oath.' 11. At no subsequent stage does the Sheikh appear to have shown any signs of going back on his delegation of responsibility in respect of foreigners other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty's Government. Difficulties, however, arose in the post-war period in connection with his claim to. exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and p. 5040/20. inhabitants of El Katr. In 1920 protests were received from Ibn Saud as to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Sheikh over Kejdi subjects. A similar protest appears to have been made at about the same time by the Sheikh of Qatr, both parties requesting the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction on Res 6 ?) 8 / 27 ' Vo1 ' t, ^ r behalf. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November g! of i .^o t0 295 s, 1920 a notice that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of of i Sept. 1927, ' Arab Rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. The decision was not well received by the Sheikh ; but it has not been contested by him, and since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British Political authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922, as subsequentlv amended.

IDsh ISTh/V- Sir, ! UufifiUifi &gt; in*. nLuuijyb; Negotiations have now, we think, been concluded for the transfer to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited (a Canadian Company) of the Concession Agreement dated the 2nd December, 1925 entered into between His Excellency The Sheikh of Bahrein and the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, Limited, as modified by stipulations or conditions v/hich have been agreed with His Majesty's Government and so that the same will become binding upon the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited, We are interested as Solicitors advising the American inter ests , We understand you are cognisant of all the facts relating to the case and you, no doubt, have a copy of the draft of the 'Assent' which it is proposed should be entered into between His Excellency and the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, Limited. You will have observed that this document is contingent, for its effect, upon the vesting in the Bahrein Petroleum Com pany Limited, of the said Concession Agreement. Such vesting will be effected by another document which in the view of the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, Limited and the Bahrein Petroleum ^ Company, Limited is sufficient for the purpose. This document,x. I \i From &gt;-RESHFIELDS, LEESE &amp; M U N N S To Sheet N9 2. Date 14th March, 1950. will not be produced to His Excellency but notice of it will be given by the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate Limited to His Excellency as is provided by the 'Assent.' We are concerned to see what (if any) laws applicable in Bahrein, affect the position. You will appreciate, of course, that we have to advise the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited that the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, Limited are definitely the legal owners of the said Concession Agreement and the rights thereunder according to the local law, as against all parties, and that when the transfer of the Agree ment to the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited is complete that Company will stand in the same position as the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate Limited now stand. There may be requirements of the local laws necessitat ing some act or formality, e.g. registration of a deed or other document or alteration of a Register by attendance of the parties by proxy to complete the title of the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, We understand there is in Bahrein, a Register of Owner ship of land but what the purpose of it is, we do not know. Would you be good enough to explain this to us, and at the same time tell us to what particular interests it relates? Would you also please advise us whether the estate or interest created by the leasing of territory under the Con-t . (130) S, LEESE &amp; MUNNS, Sheet NO Date 14th March, 1930. cession Agreement of the 2nd December 1925 creates such an estate or interest in land as would be governed by the locs.1 laws? If so, what steps would have to be taken to comply with such laws, and when? We use the term 'local laws' without having any ver^/ clear idea of what this phrase means. So far as the Regis ter we have referred to is concerned, we believe that this has been established by Custom. There are, of course, the Bahrein Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922, and tnere are, no doubt. Regulations made by you but as to the practical local effect of these, we have no knowledge. There are also, no doubt. Orders issued by His Excellency or other the State Government of Bahrein. There is one further question we would like to put to you, and that is, By whom and in what form (if any) a Receipt for moneys payable under or in respect of the Concession Agreement of the 2nd December 1925 should be given so as to constitute a complete discharge to the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited or the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, Limited, as the case may be, as against His Excellency and all other- parties (if any) interested? As you know, there are cer tain periodical payments due under the Agreement and if the provisions concerning a Mining Lease become operative, thenFIELDS, LEESE &amp; MUNNS, Sheet N o 4. Date 14th March, 1930 royalties will also probably become payable and we would like to be able to advise our Clients now and for all time what they should accept as a formal and final discharge for such payments made by them. We enclose a form of Receipt which we suggest might serve as a precedent* Do you think it will be sufxlcient? Major Frank Holmes is kindly bringing this letter to you: we have discussed it with him, and he will no doubt be able to afford to you any further explanations which you may require. If so, please cable fully to us. It would be a great convenience to us, and we think to others concerned, if we could have your short reply by cable, followed by a confirmatory letter in detail. If you could expedite the letter by Air Mail, we would appreciate this. Will you kindly permit Major Holmes to reimburse you all fees and expenses incurred in The Hon.

'he Bollcitors liave asked m to cable my reply. I infoa^ed Major holmes verbally, however, 'he TUght Honourable .ord as b fie Id, P .O., lis Majesty's Secretary of State 'or the Colonies, Jolonial Office, wmon . \I &gt; ' however, that I regretted that I not in a position zo answer these queBtion^j tiiat tlie Baiiraln atate was juridically an inciepemerit oovernmnt ana the aijaikh an independent Huier though ho did not exerciBC Jurieciiction ov&lt;?r foreigners, and I therefore suggested to him that he should approach Mr Bel grave, Acivaser to the Bahrain Govermiient, on arrival at Bahrain, \sho would be in a position to give hiis full infonaation regarding any fortualities connected nx til the registration of land which raight be required by the hoi rain law and also supply him with details regarding the register of land which was being prepared- Major Holiaes expressed the view to rae that the oil concession did not confer any ownership in tl e land and in this view X am inclined to agree. If so, no registration would ^resmoably be nece^cfcry except for such land as the Coza^any wish to occupy for buildings, etc. I do not, however, know how far the procedure for the registration of land his proceeded or #iat rules have been fraried regarding it.

Oth Sir, I liave the honour to refer to the Bahrain Oil Ooncession of 1925 and to draw jour attention to Article YI in the ihird Schedule of Mining Lease. This lease will, at the option of the Eastern and General Syndicate or tneir successors inevitably.follow the present prospecting lease, and it is the far reaching provisions of this clause that I 'wish td 'bring to jour notice. 2. You will ooserve that the wording of the second paragraph sajs that « If in spite of the efforts of the said guards thefts should occur, the Shaikh undertakes to re-r -cover the propertj stolen and to compensate the company for anj damage sustained in his territorj. ? in the event of non-recovery of the stolen propertj the value thereof shall be deducted by the company from any sums due to the Shaikh by the company. 1 3. I pointed this out to Mr. Belgrave, and he agreed with me that the State incurred a very serious lia- -bility by this section. Further, I pointea out that apart irom the question of compensation for theft, the words * and to compensate the company for any damage sustained in his territory T unless read as referring to the stolen property, would involve the State in possible liabilities that might run into thousands of pounds. I4:» 1 su^iGstBd two lijpo trie tic b.1 cases* One, a company's employee might steal 10,000 rupees from a safe bclongiiig to iheiiiand oy the wording of this clause the State v /ould clearly have to compensate the. company. Mr. Belgrave agreed nth me. Then again there is another possibility, suppose that wilful damage or sabotage occurs ris caused to trie machinery or plant, by the guards, the employees or dis- - grunt led inhabitants of Bahrain, either in or in transit from the Customs or anywhere at all inside the terri ~ l ' Li: v ^ters: it could be ag^aed that the State : jvas liable to compensate the company for this loss since it would be Any damage sustained in his territory. 1 and to do so migiit consume the royalties for the remainder of the lease. ^ sent ior Major Holmes ano. asked his view on the Article as viewed in thy light of these hypotheses. He agreed that the Article was very v^^rue, but saia tnat it had been inserted bv t- ! e Oolopf^ 1 11 ce ^^4' hy felt sure thrt the 6ompan.y would never Hepirp fo strain its meaning' uo tnr t extent. Tie woula not, however/bin a himself as to what they ;Quld interpret it to mean, as he saiu it was a ma,tte.r for 1-wyers to aeciae. enough, ..'oidtcL fie ^xpre^-i hi^sferif in writing or in any my coimidt the Compai though he holds full power of attorney from them. I gathered tnat his personal view of the meaning was that the Shaikh was responsiole for keeping the guard up to their duties ana pre- -venting petty thefts, but not for cash etc, in the charge oi ohe Company f s servants. He was however of the opinion that che guard \/oulci be responsible for- preventing damage or sabotage even by the Company ? s servants, and that the State would have to indemnify them. 6. 1 toici him that it was essential, in my opinion, that the question should be clearea up before we proceeded an^ fuitaer, so that the State might know exactly what they had to contend with. I suggested that a letter should be given ulLUUr s : his syndicate or by the proposed Company indicat- -ing the extent to which tney considered the Satliable.He appeared to resent this' and said that it was 1 Going baciv T on the concession, to v /hich I replied that to ask for an explanation of a section could not be held to be going bacj£ on an agreement# lie then said that once the assignment of the Goncession was signed, if the State approached the concessionaires, he was sure that thej would agree to a reasonable interpretation. I said that the State would then be in their hands, and Major Holmes, interrupting^saic that was exactly where they were now,. I disagreed with this, and said that I should suggest to you that the Shaikh be advised not to sign the Assignment until the point had been elucidated. 1. iiajor Holmes now became much alarmed and saia that we should be putting the idea into the Shaikh f s ksax head that he could alter the agreement at will, and creating a very dangerous precedent. I to hi him that I saw no reason why he should be informed, and that in any case he could have acquired that idea when I mentioned - the Assignment to him,but that he had not done so. He reiterated his point that the concession could not be tampered with, but I said that the assignment amounted to a favour from the Shaikh and had been put through to suit the concessionaires , anc that it was unreasonable is in the circumstances to refuse a statement of how the State stood as regards liabilities that could at present ^be/Scarcely^ assessed . 8. I then told Major Holmes that I would put forward the suggestion to you that the Shaikh should not be asked to sign the new Assignment until this matter has been cleared up / and undertook to info rip him in writing that I was going to ao so, that he might advise his firm. 1 gather his principal cause for alarm is that a ship- -load of nearly a thousand tons of materials has already left the States, and he fears that this eleventh hour hitch may cause great delay owing to the necessary consulta-4. tions with their American associates. I feel very earn- -estlj that the State has been so kept in the dark throughout the whole negotiations that we, who are definitely responsible for advising them, should leave no stone unturned to have this matter cleared up. 9. Should you decide that it is too late to take action at this stage, another opportunity will occur to bring pressure to bear on the Bahrain Petroleum Oompany, though they would no doubt re uire a _uia pro quo. In 1928 a draft supplementary agreement for an exploring, prospecting anc mining concession for the remaining areas of the islands was forwarded to the Secretary at Bus hire with this office letter 0-193 dated the 5th July. This agreement eventually fell through because Captain Parke ( who was acting as adviser) greatly increased the amounts payable in royalty. I understand from Major Holmes that he will recommence negotiations for this directly the present Assignment is disposed of. Since they are anxious to acauire this extra territory, ( not, xiajor Holmes tells me,on account of the supposed oil it covers, but because it will give them greater freedom in siting their pipelines,) ad- -vantage might be taken of this to get the Concession- -aires to accept a revised rendering of the clause to which I have taken objection, and to have it so worded fchat the liability of the Siate is reduced to reasonable- proportions. A suitable wording would appear to be one which confined the Shaikh r s responsibility to thefts directly attributable to the guards negligence ( but excluded offences by the Company's servaats ) and/or damage for which the guards could be held personally liable. It must be remembered that the guards will- be a wild5. w ild. and undisciplined 1 oodj of men, probably similar to our night watchmen, and that it is not reasonable to expect from them an efficiency and ability whicn have not yet been instilled into the MA NAMA Police Force. 10• There is one further point yhich I should like to mention. Last summer the .uestion of keeping- certain areas free from rigs etc belonging- to the Oil Company were considered, so as not to interfere with aviation. Has any conclusion been arrived at regarding this/ Major holmes believes that an undertaking has been £Civen by them, and if so I vould be glad of a copy to complete my file. I had understood that it was to be embodied in the new Assignment, but this has not been done. 11. I explained to Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Abdullah the purport of the Assignment and although Shaikh Abdullah showed alarm at hearing that the Company was not entirely British, upon learning that His Majesty*3 G-overhment had approved the transfer^ His Excellency said he was prepared to sign it after it had been translated. This has now been done, but in view of points 1 have raised in this despatch I would be glad to know whether I should not await further instructions frolii you. The witnessing of the original concession was, I find, carried out by Major Daly and not the Political Resident of the day, so there would, prima facie, appear no reason why the Political Agent's signature should not suffice on a deed transferring it to a third party.

Attention: Mr.Lloyd, Sir, We refer to the conversation which we had with Mr.Lloyd last week when we discussed the modifications which had been suggested in the Mining Lease to be granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to Eastern and G-eneral Syndicate Limited or their Assignees in accordance with the Concession dated the 2nd December, 19S5. We cabled to our Clients and informed them that a proposal had been made to restrict the liabilities of the Sheikh under Clause 6 of the Mining Lease to 10,000 Rupees per annum, and that a fu.rther suggestion had been made to release him from all liabiliuy for thefts by the Company's employees. We have now received cabled instructions from our Clients on this matter. Our Clients do not consider that they should be asked to agree to any such modifications as the form of the Mining Lease has been agreed for some time, and also as the Assent, in the form in which it is proposed it should be signed, has been approved by the Colonial Office. This Clausen j C. M This ClaLise which makes the Sheikh personally liable was clearly inserted originally so as to ensure that he would enforce the covenants in the Mining Lease to protect the Company's property and recover it if stolen. The fact that theft might be committed by an employee of the Company should not relieve the Sheikh of the liability to use his utmost endeavours to recover the same, and though it is true that the employees will have greater opportunities of stealing than outside persons, our Clients consider, and we agree, that it would be dangerous to draw any distinction between employees and other persons. Our Clients are, however, prepared to assure the Sheikh that they will not hold him responsible for thefts by the Company's European employees as the Sheikh will not have the same opportunities of enforcing nis authority on such persons. If such assurance is required, it should, we consider, be given in a separate letter and should not be inserted in the formal Assent. We should be obliged if you would therefore give the necessary instructions to the Political Agent so that he can obtain the execution by the Sheikh of the Assent in its present form at the earliest possible date. If you desire a letter of assurance to be given to the Sheikh at the same time, perhaps you will let us know, when we could quickly agree a short form of letter.

Saclosure, V n J Freshfields, Leese &amp; Manns, New Bank Buildings, 31, Old Jewry, E .G.2. 9th May, 1930. Attention: Mr.Lloyd. Sir, We enclose herewith a print of the proposed Assignment of the Concession granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate Limited in the form in which it is at present proposed that it should be executed. The reason for the deletion of the last two lines of Clause 3 is that the royalties referred to in those lines were payable on the happening of certain events prior to a fixed date; that fixed date is now passed and the events have not happened. You will observe that the second sentence of Clause 3 specifically refers to the consideration payable under the Option Agreement. As you know, we are endeavouring to ascertain whether the Assignment will need to be registered in the Local Land Registry as should this be necessary we understand you will require the statement of the consideration to be omitted from the Deed. From a cabled reply to our enquiries, #iich we have received, it would appear that registration is not necessary except at the British Agency. We The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office, S .W .I. understandunderstand that if registration is necessary the Colonial Office or the India Office will insist on the statement of consideration being deleted. Gould you please inform us if this is the case as regards the Colonial Office, and could you please make enquiries from the India Office as to the attitude which they will take up? We are, etc., (Signed) PHESHFIELDS, LEESE &amp; MOWS.79035/30. Doming Street, 15th May, 1930. G-e ntlemen, I am directed by Lord Passfield to ^ acknowledge the receipt of your letter ON/EJB , v' V- of the 7th of May regarding the liability imposed upon the Sheikh of Bahrein by Article VI in the Mining Lease scheduled to the Bahrein oil concession of the 2nd of December, 1925. 2. It is noted that your clients are not disposed to agree to the limitation of that liability to a sum not exceeding Rs.10,000 in any one year, or to the further suggestion that the Sheikh should be released from all liability for thefts committed by employees of the concessionary company. 3. The Secretary of State cannot but regret that your clients should have rejected these suggestions, but, having regard to the basis on which the negotiations for the assignment of the ^ concession have -been conducted, he will not press further the view that the modifications proposed should be adopted. r 4. Lord Passfield considers that an assurance should be given to the Sheikh of Bahrein on the n lines suggested in the third paragraph of your letter, but he is advised that the exemption from respons ibility MESSRS. FRESHFIELDS, LEESE &amp; MUNNS. - - A \responsibility which it is proposed to aooord to the Sheikh should extend to thefts by any employees of the companies concerned 'v^ho are not of local (i.e. Bahrein) origin', since any persons who fall within this definition will not be under the direct aiithority or control of the Sheikh. An assurance in these terms can best be given in the form v . of a letter, which Major Holmes might be authorised to sign on behalf of the two companies concerned, and to deliver to the Sheikh at the time of signature of the agreement setting out the conditions which govern the assignment of the concession. It is suggested that the letter might be in the following terms:- 'In further consideration of the assent of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the assignment of the Bahrein oil concession, to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited, the said Company agrees that the provisions in the second paragraph of Article VI of the Mining Lease, (which forms the Third Schedule to the concession) shall only apply in respect of thefts or damage committed by persons who are of Bahrein origin.' On the receipt of information that this form of assurance is acceptable to your clients and that Major Holmes has been authorised to sign a letter in the terms set out above, the necessary instructions will be sent to the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf. P, 5. As regards your letter CN/EJB of the 9th of May, I am to inform you that you are mistaken in supposingsupposing that either the Oolonial Office, or, so far as is known, any other department of His Majesty's Government, would wish to insist on the omission from the assignment enclosed in that letter of all mention of the consideration to be paid by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited, to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited.

Sir, / id We thaiik you for your letter dated the 15th instant, and we observe that the Secretary of ^tate is of the opinion that the Jheikh should be relieved of liability for thefts comnitted by any of the Company's employees who are not of Bahrein! origin. From our conversation on the telephone yesterday, we understana that the objection you see to making the iheikh personally liable for the acts of persons other then Bahrein natives is that such persons are subject to iiritish jurisdiction and that therefore the Sheikh would not be able to enforce his absolute authority over them, or, if they left the country, over their possessions so as to compensate himself for sums deducted by the Company from the suns payable to him. We may say that we understood and we advised our Clients that the question of amending uhe ining Lease was originally raised by the Finance Minister to the Sheikh's Government and that if our Clients did not wish to make any concessions at this stage the Colonial Office would give instructions that the Assent should be signed in its present form. It would now, however, appear that the Secretary of otate also requires an alteration to be made. As we have informed our Clients that the Assent has been approved by the Authorities, they are naturally very unwillirv^ to make any further conces sions and express some surprise that they should be requested li &lt;r '41 •; [A 3 (g) requoateci to do bo . do not baliera that our Clients have clone thia bacause '^ity wish to an fore a gainst th© ah«ikh the strict Uxm of the %r«0mdnt as this would olaarly bo bad polioy on thoir part but thoii|| :,&gt;uu.x.^uua ioi that onm m alteration such ao thiy has boon rnade f the door is open to further bargaining, 4a our Clionte hay® specifically stated that they are prepared to releaae the uheikh from liability for thefte by European employees, m oarmot acivis© them to extend such reloaee to all employees excepting Bahrain nativea, the reaaon beir^ that jurisdiction under the Order in Council of 191^ does not, apparently, extend to all I ore fevers, wd in fm% m und^rstarui from the liiaia Office timt it is questionable whether His ; ajesty has jurisdiction of^r rer©iaa© of ^hosi there muet be a oonsideraale mamk^r* furlher, the duty of arresting offendirii; foreigner who oome within British juriediotion ia ytlli. cast upon the Jheikh md therefore it tfould appeiii^ to us that there should be an inducement to cauBt him to eifeet an arreet*. le agree* however, that if it is proved Umt Uie offender haa left the country, it would be unreasonable to hold the Sheiiih liable for his niadeeds. fe have informed our Clients by cable of the secretary of atate 1 &amp; request and have Blasted to ihm that a letter m^t be addreassed to the Sheikh explicitly statir^ that hiz liability shall not extend to forei nero coming within British jurisdiction if such foreigner* ^re arrested or escape fr&amp;s the country.

Prom Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon^ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to forward, herewith, a copy of a letter addressed me by the Local Representative of the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd, Bahrain , and the draft agreement transmitted therewith. 2. I have not had time to study this fully, but I am of the general opinion that there is no need for urgency and that it would be preferable to observe the working of the first agreement, if only for a short while, so that we may observe its weak points and ensure that they are not repeat ed in the second. The Syndicate will however wish to expedite the matter as the extra area facilitates the laying of pipe lines. 3. I consider it would be preferable,should the new concession fcxs be granted,to make one combined concession for the whole area and cancel the old one which has certain undesirable features; the Syndicate would, I believe, agree to this. 4. It would appear that when the result of the cold weather boring is known the State would be in a better posi- -tion to know the value of what they are granting and if oil is found they would be justified in asking for a far higher annualuannual premium.

The real knowledge as the value of any prospective oil bearing area can only do proved by the area,bein^j given the acid test of a comprehensive and carefully directed drilling programme.Bahrein 5-7-1930. iThe surface conditions alone give a comparatively slight indication as co where the oil deposit, if present, is probably lodged# Boring within areas having the most promising looking surface indications will often jive negative results. This is owing to oil travelling for long distance through certain formations of strata. Deep well boring is a costly proceeding as the trend of an oil deposit is difficult to locate. 2ho Company has spent large suras on examining and testing virgin country, and will spend still larger suras in boring. It is essential that the Oompany should be protected against the danger from others who would make iise of the information supplied by our testbores. We desire to be protected against any form of oil operations (drilling work) in the area outside the 100,000 acres over which we now have a control. It would be possible at present for an outside company to use the information obtained by our testbores and to drain oil deposits which may be located by our Company at great expense, before we have had time to define the trend and limits of our oil deposit. When I made my first application (23-4-1928) the Political Agent of Bahrein at that time* informed me that His Excellency Sheikh Hamad was willing to grant the Company the additional area. I have no information that he has altered his attitude in this matter. % Oompany desire to be protected as far as possible and to reap the reward of the outlay which they are prepared to risk in proving the oil value of the Bahrein K, aras.

You will notice that in the. first letter No. 70935/30 the Colonial Office suggests that Major Holmes . should approach Belgrave for certain information. The f&amp;i&amp;i is not an important one, 'but it seems that Major Holmes can not address the Bahrain G-overnment direct and that if the Company wish to obtain information from them they should do so through us. If the Colonial Office do this again, perhaps their attention might 'be drawn to this point. 3. Would you please look at letter No. C.N/E.J.B dated 17th May 1930 from Freshfields to Colonies. On the o second page you will notice the amazing statement that the India Office consider that it is questionable that His Majesty has jurisdiction over Persians I This statement is not commented upon in the Colonial Office reply, so perhaps they share this impression.lt might be as well to enlighten them upon this point.
