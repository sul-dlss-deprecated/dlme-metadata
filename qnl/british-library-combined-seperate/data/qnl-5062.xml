Case number 1 is a straightforward case (folios 6-12) involving a male slave who has absconded to Muscat, and includes a copy of the manumission statement sent by the Muscat Agency to the Bahrain Agency for approval (folio 8). Case number 2 involves the abduction of a woman and two daughters by a Kalba inhabitant (folios 13-30). Correspondence relayed from the Bahrain Political Agent (Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Crabshaw Galloway) to the Shaikh of Kalba via the Sharjah Agent seeks to recover sufficient finance from the alleged kidnapper to enable the relatives of the abducted women to buy their freedom. As the alleged kidnapper has moved to Fujairah and is described by the Shaikh of Fujairah as being in 'bad financial circumstances', the Bahrain Agent requests that the Shaikh of Fujairah bear the costs for securing the release of the kidnapped women (folios 22).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00023e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00023e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
