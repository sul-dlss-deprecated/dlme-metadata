The following Notification, issued by order of the Most Noble the Governor General of India in Council, dated the 28th ultimo, is republished for general information. JBy Order of the Right Hon ble the Governor in Council, Hr~Er~GOLBfcSMll&gt;r Secretary to Government. Bombay Castle, 1th May 1852. NOTIFICATION. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. Fort William, the 28th April 1852. The Governor General of India in Council, having failed to obtain redress from the Court of Ava for injuries which had been inflicted on British Subjects, in gross violation of existing Treaties, was compelled to declare that reparation should be exacted by force of Arms. To that end an Expedition was immediately prepared and despatched to the Coast, in the hope that a a blow promptly struck against the Burmese Power might possibly lead to a concession of the just and moderate demands advanced by the Government of India, and might thus avert the necessity for engaging in extended and costly war. The Governor General in Council has had the satisfaction of publishing, for general information. Des patches which announce the success of the Expedition, in the capture of Martaban, in the destruction of 'the formidable defences constructed along the River, and in the assault and occupation of the fortifications of Rangoon. The Governor General in Council cannot employ terms too strong in expressing his unqualified approba tion of the brilliant service which has thus been performed, and his gratitude to those by whose joint exer tions it has been achieved. His admiration is due equally to the perfect cordiality and concert with which Navy and Army have acted together; to the gallantry which has been conspicuous in the Field; and to the fortitude and patience with which all have endured, without a murmur, a fierceness of climate, whose deadly influence is, unhap pily, too well attested by the number of those who have fallen victims to its effects.[ 989 ] The Governor General in Council especially desires to offer to the Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty V Naval Forces in these Seas his warm acknowledgments of the ready co-operation, and of the very effective aid which His Excellency has afforded to the Government of India by the powerful Squadron under his command, whose operations he has so ably directed, and in whose services he has borne so distinguished a part. To Lieut.-Genl. Godwin, Commanding the Forces in Ava, the Governor General in Council begs leave' to tender his most full and cordial thanks for the manner in which, by his intrepidity, his energy and ability, he has brought the Military Operations of the Force to their present successful issue ; and to congratulate him upon having thus won fresh and higher honors upon the same scene on which he formerly gained so much distinction. The Govornor General in Council has great satisfaction in publicly rendering to Commodore Lambert his sincere acknowledgments of the promptitude with which he gave his assistance to the Government of India, of his constant exertions on its behalf during a trying service, and especially of the prominent share he has now borne in the destruction of the River defences ; thus materially facilitating the movements ot the Squadron, and the ultimate success of the attack. The best thanks of the Governor General in Council are due to Brigadier Elliott, Commanding the Madras Brigade, and to Lieutenant Colonel lieignolds, who, after having taken a part in every operation of the Troops, has assumed the command of the Bengal Brigade, from which illness, which the Governor General in Council regrets, has removed Brigadier Warren. The Governor General in Council is happy to record his appreciation of the essential service rendered by Captain Lynch, the Senior Officer of the Indian Navy, to whose ability, judgment, and discretion His Excellency the Rear Admiral has borne his testimony on this occasion. And His Lordship in Council at the same time desires to mark his sense of the services of Commander Mellersh, of Commander Fishbourne, by whose aid the Government has largely profited, of Commander Tarleton, Commander Luard, Lieutenant Rice, R. N., Captain Xiblett, of H. C. S. ' Phlegethon, and of Surgeon Minter, whose personal exertions have been severally commended by His Excellency. The Governor General in Council has to add his marked acknowledgments of the valuable assistance aflbrded during the attack on the land defences of Rangoon by Lieutenant Dorville, R. N., and the Xaval Brigade under his orders. The Governor General in Council has further remarked with gratificatioix the distinguished conduct ol Captain BrookingTof H. C. Steamer ' Proserpine.' His Lordship in Council wishes to express his warm approbation of conduct which has elicited the applause, both of the Admiral and of the General who witnessed it. The conspicuous gallantry of Major Eraser, Commanding the Engineers, and his indefatigable exertions since the expedition was resolved upon, more especially in the field, command the highest praise, and the best thanks of the Supreme Government. To Lieutenant Colonel Foord, Commanding the Artillery; to Major Turton, and Major Reid, of the Bengal Artillery; to Major Montgomerie, of the Madras Artillery; to Lieutenant Colonel Coote, of Her Majesty's 18th, who has been severely wounded; to Lieutenant Colonel Thomson, of the 40th Native Infantry; to Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, of 26th Madras Native Infantry; and to Major Lockhart, of Her Majesty's 80th Regiment; to Captain May hew.

The Governor General in Council has to offer his thanks to Lieutenant Colonel Bogle, Commissioner of the Tenasserim Provinces, for the valuable aid he rendered to General Godwin in connexion with the at tack upon Martaban ; and His Lordship in Council particularly desires to record his approbation of the energetic and successful exertions of the Commissioner in giving effect to the preparations of the Govern ment for ensuring, as far as possible, the health and comfort of the Iroops to be employed upon the Expedition.

Not only to the Officers he has thus specially named, but to all the Officers, to the Non-Commissi6hed Officers, of whatever designation, and to the Soldiers and Sailors of the force, the Governor General in Council desires to convey his true and hearty thanks for the alacrity, the endurance, the bravery and good conduct they have displayed during the several operations in which they have been engaged.[ 990 ] ^ The Governor General in Council deeply laments to know that our success has not been achieved with out the sacrifice of valued lives.
