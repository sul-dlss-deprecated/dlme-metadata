Clive to Sir Austen, Chamberla — 24.) (No. 484.) ^i 1 '' Gulhek, 1927. I HAVE the honour to enclose copies of two comprehensive despatches addressed by the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Government of India on the subject of Bahrein and its future status. 2. Colonel Haworth recommends that the sheikh should, if possible, be induced formally to request His Majesty's Government to extend to him the protection which was refused to his predecessor in 1849. 3. I am only concerned with the possible reaction of any such request on the Persian Government. I cannot help feeling, however, that, looked at solely from the point of view of Anglo-Persian relations, it would be preferable—supposing that His Majesty's Government and the Government of India approve in principle Colonel Haworth's suggestion—to defer any such action until we have settled satisfactorily some of our outstanding questions, including more especially the negotiation of a new treaty. 4. Admittedly the Persian claim to Bahrein is extremely weak, but it is significant that, when discussing recently with the present Prime Minister the question of the air route to India, his Highness immediately caught me up when I mentioned Bahrein as one of the probable landing grounds in the event of a route along the southern side of the Gulf being decided on. 5. I naturally declined to be drawn into any discussion of the status of Bahrein. I merely report this as showing that Persian pretensions have in no way lessened with the lapse of time. 6. I would not, however, wish it to be supposed, in spite of the Prime Minister's remarks, that any trouble need be anticipated with the Persian Government should it be decided to construct an aerodrome on the island of Bahrein. I understood his Highness's remark rather in the nature of a reminder that Persia's claim to sovereignty had not been renounced than as a warning that the Persian Government would enter a protest. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Government of India and His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel L. B. H. Hawtorth Govemmmt of India in the Foreig (Confidential.) ' Sir, 1, 1927. I HAVE the honour to state that since I assumed charge of the appointment of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf the question of our relations with the State of Bahrein has given me some cause for reflection. Our position in that sheikhdom, and the amount of control that we exercise, appear to be open to criticism when viewed from an international standpoint. This would be of no great importance but for three factors :■— -«■ (1.) Persia has never ceased to claim sovereignty over Bahrein, and our own Foreign Office have recently not been desirous of raising the question of the status of that place. (2.) The de facto ruling chief, with whose consent we intervene, was placed in his position by us, when we deposed his father from the chief authority. (3.) The new growth of the Wahabi power. 4229 [16910] b I2. The ex-Sheikh Isa, still nominally sheikh, appealed to the Viceroy against his deposition, and through his solicitors despatched a caveat to Government saying that he was not bound by the acts of his sons. An appeal to the League of Nations by Persia forwarding an appeal by Sheikh Isa or one of his relations on the lines of the Persian protest in 1869 would, I think, place u's in a difficult position. While I do not consider this a very likely event now, owing to our better relations with Sheikh Isa, it does not seem to be sound politics to leave so important a matter to chance; there are many other combinations to consider, such as Sheikh Hamad himself changing his view with regard to us; interference by Ibn Sand with the religious appeal; indeed, any of the possible derangements which can occur where matters depend upon the personal element alone. 3. In studying the question of the development of our position in Bahrein to its present condition many other matters arise, such as the still existing claims of Persia, and in the past those of Muscat, the Wahabis, the Egyptians and the Turks, all of which affect the validity of the Persian demands. 4. In order to prevent one despatch being too unwieldy I have found it necessary to divide the subject into two despatches, the first dealing with the subjects mentioned in the above paragraph, i .e., the international aspect, the second dealing with the facts which led to our taking so intimate a part in the internal administration of the islands and with the degree to which that interference has now reached. The first despatch is bound to be a long one. When I say that the important dates which we have to consider to-day are 1783, 1803, 1811, 1820, 1822, 1838, 1848, 1859, 1869, 1880, 1886 and 1892, while many other dates of almost equal importance occur, it will be seen ( that a period is covered during which constant activity was kept up which cannot be disposed of in a few pages, and of which activity every incident which I quote has an important bearing on the decisions and the opinions to be formed. 5. In this despatch, then, I will deal with the history of the sheikhdom for the last 150 years, showing how Bahrein became involved in our policy in the Persian Gulf and the facts upon which Persia bases its claim to the island, a claim which she has never dropped though it is a century and a half since she has had any form of jurisdiction in the place. In actuality both the Wahabis and the Sultan of Muscat have had far more recent possession of the islands, and the claim of Persia has been kept alive by purely diplomatic or fictitious incidents which have occurred through the difficulties in which the Sheikhs of Bahrein have found themselves, either in preserving their independence, or in meeting the activities of rival pretenders to the sheikhdom. The claims of Persia would not intrinsically stand the test of examination by a committee of the League of Nations. 6. Tor the purpose before us it is necessary to go back to the year 1782, at which date Bahrein was unquestionably in possession of the Persians, who had first occupied it in 1602, when they expelled the Portuguese. How long they held it has apparently not been determined, but in 1718 the islands were taken for a short time by the Omani Sultanate. In the middle of the 18th century the Howalah Arabs controlled the politics of the archipelago, but in 1753 the Persians definitely occupied the islands. In 1783 they were once for all driven out by the Arabs, led by the sheikhs of the Utab tribe, who still hold Bahrein to-day. 7. When it is said at any time that the Persians held the Bahrein Islands, the expression needs explanation/ Until as recently as 1854 Bushire, from whence the sea power came, was held by an Arab sheikh under Persian sovereignty, and to this day the Persian islands of the Persian Gulf are occupied by Arabs and Arab sheikhs, who are similarly Persian subjects. These are the men who supplied thd ships and the crews which 'acted for the Persians in Persian Gulf history ; the Persians have never been seamen. , ™ _ , . , 8. Thus,, in 1783, Bahrein was held by the Arab Sheikh Nasir of Bushire, under the orders of the Persian Government, then settled at Shiraz. The garrison, when attacked by the Arabs from the southern mainland, was commanded by Sheikh Nasir's son, and after a siege of two months' duration, the latter capitulated on the 27th July, and the garrison were permitted to return to Bushire. Henceforward, the archipelago was ruled by the A1 Khalifeh section of the Utabi tribe, a fact which gave umbrage to the Jalahmieh section of the tribe, who withdrew to Qatar on the mainland, whence the Utab had come, and who, for many years to follow, supplied claimants or joined in with other claimants for the attacks on the ruling sheikhs.■ 'f 11 s ^ me y ear J J' 83, the Persian Arab Sheikhs of Bushire and Hormuz, assisted by Persian troops, made preparations on a large scale for an attack on -bahrem, m which the Sheikh of the Qowasim on the Pirate Coast was to take part, but the expedition never sailed. In 1785 similar preparations were made, but were broken up by the death of Ali Murad Khan of Shiraz. During the domestic difficulties of the Shiraz Government which followed .Bahiein remained unmolested, during which time it acquired a great mercantile fleet, and the prosperity of the islands developed till they became the chief commercial emporium of the western end of the Persian Gulf. m ' ;&lt;)r next generation such threats as were made to the independence of Bahrein came, not from Persia, but from other sources. In 1791 Sayyid, Sultan of Muscat, with the encouragement of the Persian Governor of Shiraz, which place was no longer the seat of the Persian Government, declared war on Bahrein. The Utab Sheikhs, alarmed by his proceedings, opened correspondence with Sheikh Nasir of Bushire, and, on their offering to become tributary to Persia, the sheikh proceeded privately to Bahrein and received an instalment of the revenue for the previous year on behalf of Persia. 11. In 1800 Sayyid, Sultan of Muscat, invaded Bahrein, deported twenty-five of the leading families to Muscat, and established an Omani garrison on Muharraq Island. This garrison was, in the following year, however, compelled by the Utab to surrender and to evacuate Bahrein. The Persians do not seem to have assisted, but in the same year, 1801, the Muscat ruler, with assistance from Bushire, given with the permission of the Persian Governor of Shiraz, again landed at Bahrein. 12. By this time, however, the Bahrein Sheikhs had secured the support of the Wahabis, who were threatening the outposts of Oman, and Sayyid Sultan was obliged to return to protect his own country. Por the next ten years the Sheikhs of Bahrein succumbed, though reluctantly, to the influence of the Wahabis. In 1803 they sent a fleet to cruise against Muscat during the pearl season, and not only sustained the resultant pecuniary loss, but also received a heavy defeat. In 1805 they joined a movement to destroy Wahabi influence, but in 1810 the Wahabis appointed an agent to live at Bahrein to superintend the administration, though leaving the local authority in the hands of the Utab Sheikhs. At the same time they appointed Wahabi teachers to convert the people to the Wahabi doctrine. 13. In 1811 the Wahabi Amir reduced his garrison in Bahrein in consequence of the gradual advance of the Egyptians on his frontiers. The Imam of Muscat attacked Bahrein, and the Wahabi agent was taken prisoner and the power of the Utab restored. 14. To follow, year by year, the change of fortune of Bahrein, its dependence now upon the Wahabis, its dangers now from the Sultan of Muscat, and then the Egyptians, who had ousted the Wahabis, the claims of Turkey from the date they conquered the Wahabi country, and the continued though intermittent claim of Persia, though every detail of it bears upon our position in Bahrein and that of Persia, has taken a hundred pages of foolscap to note upon. It is obvious that no despatch could bear this weight. I have accordingly written, with the assistance of Major Barrett, Political Agent of Bahrein, a monogra ph on the subject, which I will forward separately and which can be referred toT'iT necessary, and in this despatch I will attempt to keep to the main events which have affected the question. 15. In 1817 the Resident found the conduct of the Utab Sheikh most unsatis factory in connection with piracy, our main concern in the Persian Gulf, and Bahrein became the principal mart for the property plundered by pirates, and the main depot from which the Qowasim, the pirate centre, drew their supplies of rice and dates. In the previous year, 1816, the Resident, Lieutenant Bruce, of the Indian navy, had made in informal agreement with the sheikhs, and in 1819 an agreement of a similar nature was contemplated by the Government with the object of restraining the Bahrein Arabs from piracy. 16. In 1820 the Persian Governor asked the Sultan of Muscat, and, indeed, the British also, to convey Persian troops to Bahrein. In the same year the Bahrein Government, fearing that an attack would succeed, made full submission to the Sultan of Oman and agreed to pay him an annual tribute of 3,000 dollars per annum. Both parties appear to have asked for the guarantee of the British Government to this agreement. [16910] b 2u In February of the same year a preliminary treaty of peace was made by the sheikhs with the Bombay Government to prevent the sale of plundered goods, and under this treaty the sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the general treaty of peace of the Trucial Coast. 17. In 1822 an extraordinary incident took place, and it is upon this that the Persians mainly base their claim to the Islands of Bahrein. Captain Bruce, the Resident at Bahrein, had been considerably worried by the attempts of rival claimants to the Bahrein principality, and he finally came to the conclusion that the only way to achieve peace, and to prevent piracy, was to hand Bahrein over to Persia. Accordingly, in August 1822 he made an extraordinary and unauthorised agreement with the Prince, Governor of Shiraz, relating to the whole of the Persian Gulf. It may be added that the Governor of Shiraz was also not authorised by his Government to enter into this agreement. 18. In this agreement, with reference to Bahrein, it was stated that the Islands of Bahrein had always been subordinate to the Government of Fars, against whose authority the sheikh of the islands had lately become rebellious, that accordingly the flag granted to the sheikhs under the general treaty of Persia should be withdrawn, and that no assistance should in future be granted by Great Britain to the Utab Sheikhs, that on the contrary she should assist Persia against them by lending one or two vessels. In other words, the title of Persia to Bahrein was explicitly admitted. 19. The Government of Bombay promptly disavowed the action of their representative in Fars and removed Captain Bruce from his appointment. In doing so they remarked regarding the agreement:— ' It acknowledges the King of Persia's title to Bahrein, of which there is not the least proof, and to which the British Government cannot assent without injuring the pretensions of the Imaum and the Attabees. It promised our aid against every power possessed of an island in the Gulf, and expressly against the Attabees, to whom we are bound by a treaty of friendship, and with whose conduct we have every reason to be satisfied.' The Government of Bombay also pointed out that the agreement totally violated all the principles of our policy in the Persian Gulf. The Shah of Persia appears to have been equally annoyed with his representative for conducting unauthorised negotiations, and he equally refused to ratify the agreement, n Muscat ma( j e its last attack on Bahrein, and was defeated partly by the Utab, partly by cholera. , • . The Imam lost considerable prestige in the Gulf by his defeat, and m future confined his attention mainly to Africa. 1 „ .. It may be stated that the various attacks of Muscat were oased on the failure of Bahrein to pay the tribute to which it had bound itself. _ A 21. In 1830 the power of the Wahabis was again established in Central Arabia, and Bahrein immediately felt the repercussion. ^ At the end of the year the Wahabis presented the sheikhs with a demana icr the payment of zakaB and for the cession of Dammam, on the mainland of Hasa, which was still held by Bahrein. The sheikh attempted, without success, to obtain the intervention of the British authorities; in consequence, an agreement was ma e i with the Wahabis in which the supremacy of the Wahabi Amir was acknowledged, 1 and the right to the payment of the zakalE admitted. The Amir in return undertook ^ 1 to protect Bahrein against external aggression. In 1833 the sheikhs threw oft their i allegiance, but in 1836, as there was talk of the Persian Government raising their claim to sovereignty, the sheikhs once more became reconciled to the wahabi Amir and agreed to pay him 2,000 dollars per annum as tribute, the Amir promising m return to supply troops for the defence of Bahrein. _ ^ - 22. As will have been seen throughout, the object of the British Government had been to achieve maritime peace for the safety of the cariying of their trade, and in 1836 a restrictive line was laid down for the chiefs of the Trucial Coast beyond which hostilities at sea were not permitted. This restrictive line was extended to the Sheikhs of Bahrein. j ^ 23. In 1838 the Wahabi Amir was captured by the Egyptians and deported to Esrypt, a puppet being set up in his place. -u i, j j The Sheikh of Bahrein was much alarmed at the rumours he heard and, m5 reply to the demands of the puppet Amir Khalid, professed himself to be a subiect of the Persian Government; as a result the Persian Governor of Shiraz sent an envoy to reside at Bahrein, but his mission was a failure. The intentions of K hurshid Pasha, the Governor of Hasa, now became clear, and the Government of India found themselves, to some extent, bound to anticipate the intentions of Eter Alajesty s Government regarding the policy to be pursued in the Persian Gulf, and the presence of a British naval squadron in the Gulf was made use of, and the commander was instructed 'strongly to use his influence' to deter the Egyptian general from further encroachment. The admiral was empowered, in the event of the Sheikh of Bahrein soliciting British aid, to afford «very encouragement to resist, and all the support he could render without engaging in actual hostilities. The Governor-General of India was not disposed at the time to enter into any new engagement with the Sheikh of Bahrein, but the admiral was instructed, in case such an engagement should be suggested, so far to encourage the proposals of the sheikh as to transmit them for the consideration of the Government of India. In other words, the Government realised the seriousness of the situation if the Egyptians desired to annex Bahrein, but did not wish to be drawn into a difficult situation unless circumstances really demanded it. 24. From this period dates our more active intervention in the affairs of Bahrein. In a letter dated the 18th April, 1839, the Indian Government advanced beyond' the position they had taken up, and empowered the admiral, in the event of the sheikh claiming British intervention, and offering to place his territories under British protection, to assure him of the temporary protection of Her Majesty's squadron and to intimate his action to the Egyptian commander. About the same time the admiral visited Bahrein, accompanied by Captain Edmunds, Assistant Political Resident, and Sheikh Abdullah gave the latter a promise that he would take no steps to place himself under the authority or protection of a foreign Power without first consulting the British Resident; but in the same year the sheikh unexpectedly acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and covenanted to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dollars per annum on condition, that his local authority should be preserved and that no Egyptian representative should be sent to reside at Bahrein. The sheikh justified his action by the Resident's refusal to give him advice, of a specified assurance of support, and of a virtual immunity from disturbance which he had purchased for a trifling and mere pecuniary sacrifice. 25. The Resident delivered a written protest to the sheikh, and another in nearly the same terms to the Egyptian commander. The sheikh protested that he - would never, even at the demand of the Egyptians, place himself in opposition to the British Government, and he offered, on condition that distinct pledges of protection should be given him in writing, to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependent of the British Government—but he refused to put this in writing. 26. This circumstance is most illuminating, especially in relation to our dealings with the sheikhs of Qatar and the trucial coast to-day, where the circum stances are very similar. Without our definite pledge of assistance the Sheikh of Bahrein of that day could not afford to compromise himself with the Power on the mainland. The Egyptian question was brought to an end in the following year, 1840, on the evacuation of Hasa. 27. By his conduct with the Egyptians, Sheikh Abdullah had forfeited the trust of the British Government, and the possibility of his being displaced by a more favourably disposed sheikh was discussed. In 1842 a rival appeared in the form of one, Mohammed-bin-Khalifeh, a grand- nephew of Sheikh Abdullah. The Wahabis, who were once again in power, supported the young claimant, and Isa-bin-Tarif of Qatar, and Bashir-bin-Rahmak, an Utab chief of the Jatahmieh section, asked permission of the Resident to join themselves with Sheikh Mohammed, This sanction was given, and in April 1843 Bahrein passed into the possession of Sheikh Mohammed. 28. In 1843 the Government of India issued orders that an invasion of Bahrein by the ex-Sheikh Abdullah would be prevented, if necessary, by a British naval force. In 1847, however. Sheikh Mohammed bound himself to pay tribute to the Wahabis at the rate of 2,000 dollars per annum. 29. In the same year, 1847, Turkish claims to Bahrein were advanced from6 Basra, apparently for the first time. The sheikh was invited to declare his allegiance to the Sultan and to submit a detailed list of his shipping in order that it might be registered under the Turkish flag. For various reasons the sheikh was disposed to accept this advance on the part of the Turkish Government. 30. This caused the Bombay Government to state that it was obviously desirable to exclude interference by foreign Powers in the affairs of the Persian Gulf, inas much as without retaining supreme authority the British Government could not hope to secure the performance of the objects' which they had attained in that quarter at a large expense. The board of directors concurred in their recommendation that ' any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British naval force.' The Resident, Major Hennell, was authorised to ascertain whether the sheikh was inclined to enter into a. closer connection with the British power, and some months later Sheikh Mohammed expressed a wish that his sheikhdom should be taken under British protection, but in 1849 the Resident was directed to decline the proposal of the sheikh, but to assure him of the continuance of the goodwill and friendship of the British Government. In 1850 the sheikh was on bad terms with us. and sent insulting messages to the Resident. 31. In 1851 the sheikh was on the point of succumbing to the Wahabis when a British squadron arriving took the islands under their wing. In the same year a claim by the Porte to the sovereignty over Bahrein was summarily rejected by the British Government. 32. In 1853 the British Government authorised the Government of Bombay to offer every obstacle to an attack upon these islands by the Wahabi Amir, who was now nominally subject to the Ottoman Empire, on the ground that Her Majesty's Government would no't permit the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Government or by anyone acting for them or in their interest. In 1859 the Persian Gulf squadron was again despatched for the protection of the islands, and the Wahabi Governor sued for pardon. 33. In 1859 Sheikh Mohammed made simultaneous application for protection to the Persian Governor of Pars, and to the Turkish Vali of Bagdad. The response of the Turks was delayed, but a Persian agent, one Mirza Mehdi Khan, a well-known Anglophobe, almost immediately arrived in Bahrein, the Persian flag was hoisted, and Persian sovereignty proclaimed. Scarcely, however, had these ceremonies been performed when Mohammed Bey, the emissary of the Mustafa, Nuri Pasha, appeared, the Persian flag was again lowered and the Turkish flag raised into its place—to complete the absurdity the Persian agent refused to leave Bahrein or surrender his imaginary authority. 34. Sir Henry Rawlinson, the British Minister in Tehran, differed from Captain Felix Jones, the Resident, and regarded the matters as of slight account. He contented himself with obtaining from the Shah's Minister an assurance that no military occupation of Bahrein should be undertaken by Persia until the question of title had been settled by diplomatic discussion. The Government of Bombay instructed the Resident not to interfere with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Turkey or Persia, otherwise than by a protest, and by an intimation that the matter had been reported to Her Majesty's Govern ment, and that aggression on the neighbouring tribes would be prevented by force if necessary. While discussion on the subject was continuing, the Turkish and Persian agents apparently vanished from Bahrein. 35. In 1861 the sheikh commenced hostilities against Hasa, but was brought to his senses by the despatch of Her Majesty's ships to the spot. He made submission and signed a'convention in May of that year, acknowledging the validity of the treaties and conventions concluded with the British Government by his predecessors, and undertook to recognise the jurisdiction of the British agent and the Political Resident over British subjects of every kind in Bahrein, and to allow the latter to reside in his dominions. One result of this convention was to assimilate the position of the Sheikh of Bahrein, who was not a party to the Perpetual Treaty of Peace, to that of the trucial chiefs. 36. In 1863 the chief was again behaving badly, and at the end of 1865 the Resident seized one of his war vessels. The Persian Government, who had in 1862 complained about a similar incident, now complained again on the ground that.*7 7 under the agreement concluded by Captain Bruce in 1822, Bahrein was dependency of Persia. The Government of India informed the Minister at Tehran of the facts of the case, and stated that whatever might have been the pretensions of the Shah to Bahrein in bygone days, he could not now be regarded as having any rights in the principality. This view was approved of by Her Majesty's Government in 1867. 37. At this time the Sheikh of Bahrein was paying a sum of 4,000 dollars j annually to the Wahabis on account of Qatar, but was held by the Government of ! India to be independent as far as Bahrein was concerned. Owing to his treacherous and piratical destruction of Dohah and Wakrah, the chief towns of Qatar, in October 1867, Sheikh Mohammed of Bahrein was deposed in 1868 by the action of the British Government, and his brother, Sheikh Ali, was appointed in his place, and protest was again made by the Persian authorities. 38. A complaint, in which Bahrein was claimed to be the property of Persia, was addressed by the Shah's Minister to Her Britannic Majesty's Minister in Tehran; another was addressed by the karguzar at Shiraz to Colonel Pelly, the Resident at Bushire; and a third, with which were enclosed two letters from the deposed Sheikh of Bahrein, was lodged at the Foreign Office on the 13th April, 1869, by the Persian Minister in London. A principal ground of complaint was that no previous notice had been given to Persia of the British intention to proceed against Bahrein. 39. In a reply sent on the 29th April, 1869, after consultation between the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Persian Minister was reminded that the Sheikh of Bahrein had at different periods in the past entered into direct communication with the British Government; he was assured that the sole objects of the British Government in holding the sheikh to those engagements were the prevention of piracy, of the slave trade and the maintenance of the police of the Gulf, duties of which Great Britain would gladly, if it were possible, divest herself in favour of Persia. In conclusion, a promise was given that, should punitive measures against the Sheikh of Bahrein again become necessary. Her Majesty's Government would, if practicable, cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand, and that in cases which this might be impossible in consequence of the delay which a reference to the Court of Tehran would involve, a full communi cation on the subject would be made to the Persian Government. The object of this reply was to avoid causing irritation at Tehran, but it is not surprising that it was subsequently quoted against us. 40. In the same year Sheikh Mohammed attacked Bahrein and Sheikh Ali was killed in the defence. The British Government blockaded Bahrein, captured and deported the sheikhs concerned in the attack and replaced Sheikh Ali by his son. Sheikh Fsa. (The latter has reigned for fifty-eight years, and was in 1923, four years ago, deposed by us from the actual control, his son. Sheikh Hamad, the present sheikh, being made deputy ruler in his place.) 41. In the same year, 1869, the Persian Government were informed of the action taken and the usual complaint followed. The Government of India replied to the Secretary of State, pointing out that the Persian Government had no navy and was incapable of assisting the British Government in maintaining the peace at sea, while, had they had a navy, it would only have meant that they would have been embroiled with the Sultan of Oman, with the Arab principalities, with the Wahabi power and with Turkey, all of whom were antagonistic to her; indeed, the assertion of claims by Persia had already caused the revival of similar obsolete claims by Turkey and the other Powers. 42. In a despatch of the 27th May, 1870, the Government of India observed :— ' If we are no longer prepared to continue the performance of the tasks we have undertaken we must withdraw altogether; but the consequences of such a step would be so disastrous, not only to our national honour but to the peace of the Gulf, to the prosperity of the tribes inhabiting the littoral, and to the lives and prosperity of our subjects who during the peace of the last fifty years have settled on the shores and embarked enormous capital in the pearl fisheries and the trade with the mainland, that we cannot contemplate this course as one of which Her Majesty's Government could for a moment contemplate.' 43. A protest was also entered by the Turkish Minister in London against the proceedings of the British authorities in Bahrein, which were represented as acts ofBritish sovereignty over ' a portion of Turkish territory.' The Ottoman Minister was informed that the British Government could not recognise the Turkish claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein. (44. In 1892 the question came under consideration again in consequence of certain taxes, recoverable from Ottoman subjects only, having been levied at Basra upon natives of Bahrein, and a demand for a refund was preferred by the British Assistant Political Agent, who contended that Bahrein and its inhabitants were under British protection. On this occasion the Turkish Government addressed the British Embassy at Constantinople and denied the title of natives of Bahrein to British protection; but the reply, given under the instructions of Her Majesty's Government, was to the effect that, as Bahrein was now under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen of England, no interference by the Ottoman authorities with the natives of Bahrein could be admitted. A year later, in April 1893, the Turkish Government again protested against the assumption by the British Assistant Political Agent at Basra of a title to protect natives of Bahrein; and once more Her Majesty's Government maintained the right of their diplomatic and consular representatives in the Ottoman Empire to extend their good offices to the class of persons in question.) 45. In 1880 interest in the Persian Gulf was being shown by foreign Powers. French, American and Japanese vessels had visited its waters. In the circumstances; believing that Bahrein, as one of the chief commercial centres, would soon become an object of this attention, the Resident, finding the sheikh disposed to conclude a special arrangement with the British Government, took the opportunity to obtain his signature to an agreement which was approved by the British Government in 1881. 46. It bound the sheikh to abstain from entering into negotiations with or making treaties with other Governments, except with the sanction of the British Government, and he agreed to refuse permission to any other Government, other than the British, to establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots in Bahrein territory, except with the consent of the British Government. 47. In 1886 the Shah of Persia had verbally requested Mr. Nicholson to convey to the British Government the fact that he considered the communication made to him in 1869 as tantamount to an admission of his rights over Bahrein, and that he was anxious to establish authority over the islands, either by sending a Governor to Bahrein or by recognising the sheikh as his representative, but that he wished the maritime police to remain in the hands of the British naval authorities. An answer was prepared, but not delivered, as the Shah did not revert to the subject. It was to the effect that Her Majesty's Government did not concur in His Majesty the Shah's interpretation of the communication of 1869; on the contrary, they considered Bahrein to be independent. 48. In 1888 an intrigue by certain Persian officials with the Sheikh of Qatar, which place now had no connection with Bahrein, was supposed to contain danger to the islands, and two warships were stationed at Bahrein with instructions to prevent, by force if necessary, any hostile attempt to land by the Turks, Persians or Arabs. 49. In 1892 a document similar to that of 1880 was signed by the Sheikh of Bahrein, with an additional provision against the cession by the sheikh of territory to foreign Governments. In this document the sheikh undertook on no account to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government, not to consent, except with the concurrence of the British Government, to the residence within his territory of the agent of any other Government. And on no account to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, any part of his territory save to the British Government. 50. The reign of Sheikh Isa was disturbed during a number of years by the ambitious projects of the Porte and the formation of a Turkish province upon the adjoining mainland of Hasa. Bahrein was, however, protected by the British Government against the danger of annexation. 51. At times, further claims by the Turks were made, and in January 1893 the local Turkish Governor of Qatif proclaimed that Bahrein and Oman had reverted to Ottoman jurisdiction and Turkish flags were forced on the owners of Bahrein boats. In August of the same year, in a formal notification by the same official, it was stated that the British Government had no connection with Bahrein, which was a part of the Turkish Empire and would in future be treated as such. This notice was posted up in the bazaars. On representation the notice was withdrawn, but the Turkish Government refused the right of the British authorities to protect Bahrein subjects at Basra or on Turkish soil.9 52. In 1895 the British Government intervened forcibly to prevent an invasion from Qatar and attacked the tribes at Zubarah on the mainland, who were supported by Turkish officers. The Turkish Government protested, but the British Govern ment replied that it did not recognise Turkish jurisdiction on the coast of Qatar. From this date forward, though Turkish claims persisted, no actual fear of annexation occurred. 53. In 1897 the Constantinople Board of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein, but the proposal was abandoned on the statement by the British delegate that Bahrein was under British protection. In 1898 the Porte, professing that «they had heard that a British vice-consul had been appointed to Bahrein, requested Her Majesty's Government to apply to them for an exequatur, a request which naturally was not considered. 54. In 1905 the Porte were again informed that Bahrein was under British protection. At this time our relations with Sheikh Isa were very strained, and in 1906 rumours not devoid of foundation were current that the sheikh desired to place himself under the protection of Turkey. 55. In the meantime the Persian Government had continued to press their claim to the islands. In 1899 our Minister informed the Persian Government that since 1880 the Sheikh of Bahrein had been precluded by treaty from holding direct relations with foreign Powers, and that his subjects were under British protection. 56. In 1905 the Persian Government refused to consider Bahrein subjects residing in Persia as being under British protection. In February 1906 the Legation informed the Persian Government that they maintained the British right to exercise good offices on behalf of Bahreinis, and declared the Persian claim to be entirely inadmissible. They stated that the island was under British protection, and that the Ottoman Government, who had on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein, had invariably received this reply. On this the Grand Vizier again raised the question, and referred to Captain Bruce's agreement of 1822. In reply it was pointed out that the agreement in question, so far from having been ratified, had been expressly repudiated by the British Government, and that the Shah had also withheld his approval, and had'censured the Prince Governor of Shiraz for entering into such an agreement without his authority. 57. Thus, though both Turkey and Persia had been informed by the British Government that Bahrein was under British protection, neither of them had, up to 1914, when war broke out, waived their claims to that place. 58. In 1910 the political agent, Bahrein, reported that two Persian merchants were issuing passes for travel to Persian subjects in Bahrein, while the Persian officials in Persian ports were taking 100 rupees security from Persian travellers to ensure that their passports on return were vise by Abdul Nabi Kazeruni, a Persian merchant residing at Manameh, the capital of Bahrein. The matter was reported to Tehran, but the Foreign Office decided that it was undesirable to raise the question by a protest to Tehran. 59. Presumably the custom continued until 1913, for in that year the political agent again reported the incident, but brought successful pressure to bear on the merchant to make him discontinue this practice. Reports show that in 1914 two other merchants were viseing passes, but the signature of any known merchant or the political agent was accepted. 60. The German firm of Wonckhaus had been established at Bahrein since 1901, and in 1909 the German Hamburg-Amerika agent appeared desirous of supporting the Turkish claim, for ships of that line hoisted the Turkish flag while lying in harbour. On the political agent taking up the question the practice was stopped. In 1913 Ibn Saud captured Hasa, and with this,and the Great War,Turkey faded out of the picture. 61. During the war Ibn Saud established a commercial forwarding agent at Bahrein, and he began to take some interest in Bahrein affairs. During the war period there was nothing to notice. At its termination, however, Ibn Saud began to take more interest in Bahrein, and he encouraged the Dowasir tribe in its contumacy by offering them sanctuary in Hasa. The political agent reported ;— ' Ibn Saud is seeking to interfere in Bahrein affairs, and it is to his advantage that inefficient administration should continue, so as to enable him to make secret alliances with independent factions, such as the Dowasir.' [16910] c10 When this tribe finally left Bahrein in 1923 they were given shelter by Ibn baud in Dammam in Hasa. 62. In 1922 the Persian question again arose over the matter of passports. In June of that year the British consul at Bunder Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah, the port at which the British-India ships call trom Bahrein, had ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certificates of identity issued to Banrem subjects, but on representation orders were issued from Tehran to Lingah that tms action was not to occur again. /-i + + + In 1923 the Persian Government instructed its officials in the (rult to treat Bahreinis as Persian subjects, and the Persian consul at Nejef issued a notice to the effect that Bahreinis should register at his consulate as Persians. In the previous year, 1922, a postal conference was held at Bushire, and the Persian delegate, while not for the moment pressing for the Bahrein Post Office, intimated that his attitude was without prejudice to Persian claims on Bahrein. At the same time a press campaign was started in the Persian papers, demanding the return of Bahrein to Persia. 63. In 1922 the Foreign Office in London began to take a strong line regarding the conditions prevailing in the Government at Bahrein, and on the 7th December of that year addressed the Government of India in the following terms : ' I am to express the earnest hope that steps may be taken forthwith for the introduction at Bahrein of reforms tending to ensure the equitable treatment of Shiahs.' Colonel Knox, the acting Resident, protested against action being pressed too strongly. „ _ _. . ... 64. In replying to the Secretary of State the Government of India, m tneir telegram dated the 14th May, 1923, stated ;— ' Knox overlooks the fact that the Foreign Office consider the time has come to face the direct issue with Persia, and that should Persia appeal to the League of Nations misrule would be the only serious flaw in our case. Publicity is a new factor that cannot be ignored. Developments are likely to have an unsettling effect on Ibn SaUd. Prompt action in Bahrein is imperative, and Knox should be given authority to take it at his discretion. • — • We desire only to put ourselves right in the eyes of Bahrein and the world.' 65. In first pressing these reforms, the Government of India stated : ' Nothing should be done to encourage the idea that the sheikh is introducing the reforms at Government dictation.' 66. The question of these reforms and our interference in internal affairs is dealt with in my accompanying despatch No. 295-S of to-day's date. 67. The international aspect of the case is then that Persia, depending upon her possession of Bahrein up to 1783, on the agreement of Captain Bruce in 1822, and on our communication to her in 1869, maintains her claim to Bahrein, notwith standing the Muscat and Wahabi possession which intervened and the long subsequent independence of the sheikhs. It is doubtful whether she to-day has any knowledge of the fact that on three occasions, in 1791, in 1838 and in 1859, she temporarily assumed protection of Bahrein, though for so short a time that no real claim could be based upon it. In the third case the circumstances would only count against her. However, in Foreign Office letter, dated the 31st December, 1926, addressed to the Under-Secretary of State, India, it is stated :— ' On political grounds it is of great importance to avoid any action which would result in the re-awakening of the controversy as to the sovereignty of Bahrein.' 68. In 1922, however, we stated, as quoted above, that Colonel Knox was unaware that we were ready to meet the Persian claim, and even to put it before the League of Nations. Thus, it is obvious it is only our other commitments with Persia which made it undesirable publicly to meet the question openly in 1926. 69. But the real danger is not from Persia, since, if the point was forced on us, we should have no hesitation and no difficulty in disposing of her very illusionary■ 11 claims. But the resulting investigation would show the weakness of our own position in Bahrein, based, as it is, upon the continued content of the sheikh. Our treaties give us no right to our present domination, a point mentioned by Sheikh Isa in his petition to Government, and which would certainly come out before an international tribunal. All that we could prove would be the independence of Bahrein and our protection based on custom and consent, but should Sheikh Hamad desire it, or should Sheikh Isa intervene, any international tribunal would limit our powers of action in the islands. Except so far as dependent upon the goodwill of the sheikh our past protection would give us internationally no ground for maintaining our position in the future. 70. Indeed, this point we ourselves have brought out in communication to the Sublime Porte, which we now desire to repeat to Ibn Saud. ( Vide paragraph 5 of Foreign Office letter, dated Foreign Office, the 7th July, 1927, to the Under-Secretary of State for India, forwarded to me under vour No. 402-N. dated the 17th August, 1927.) In that communication we stated that as regards Bahrein and the trucial chiefs of Oman, British rights in the Persian Gulf relied not merely on the agreements concluded and transmitted at that time to the Ottoman Government, but on the custom, consent, and long-established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India. 71. Persia is not then the real danger except in so far as she would expose the weakness of our position. The future danger to our policy lies in the growth of the Wahabi power and its extension to the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. 72. En this reference I will again quote from Sir Percy Cox's remarks at the Central Asian Society on the 27th October last, which I quoted in a previous despatch. He said, with regard to Ibn Saud :— ' I have discussed his ambitions with him many times. It may be of interest if I tell you briefly what they are. Practically, he thinks that he is justified in principle in regaining any territory that his forefathers had a century ago, whether as territory or as a sphere of influence. Oman was in their sphere of influence ' ' In my time, before the war, we had intimate relations with Ibn Saud; we had a treaty with him under which we paid him a subsidy, and it was part of the agreement that he should not attack or molest any friends of ours or any chiefs who were in treaty relations with us ... . but he quite realised we could not go on paying this for ever. But what he felt was this : Up to now I have been under specific obligation not to annoy the British Government by any policy that I pursue .... but now they have felt obliged to stop any payment to me, I think I am entitled to pursue my own policy and work out my destiny as I think best. He is now doing that. Up to now he has been extraordinarily correct and statesmanlike in all that he has done. We have never been able to put him in the wrong I have little doubt that in the course of time he will seek to extend his authority over the interior of Oman.' 73. The subject on which Sir Percy Cox was speaking was Oman, but if Oman was under Wahabi influence, Bahrein was under Wahabi control, and it would be difficult to say in which place our position was strongest or more important. 74. Here we have from the fountain head a statement of Ibn Sand's projects on the shores of Arabia. Let us see how his action bears out Sir Percy Cox's statements. In 1916, as Sir Percy Cox states, we had a treaty with Ibn Saud. In 1927 we attempted to include a section in the treaty with the following wording;— ' His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and Sultan of Nejd and its Dependencies undertakes, as bis fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrein, and of the Sheikhs of Katar and the Oman coast, who are under the protection of the Government of His Britannic Majesty, and who have treaty relations with the said Government.' With the exception that no reference is made to the question of determining the limits of the territories mentioned, this article repeats the provisions of article 6 of the treaty, which we had already made with him in 1916. [16910] c 212 75. Yet Ibn ; and now found it inconsistent with his dignity as an independent ruler to accept the phrase ' to refrain from all aggression or interference, more particularly because the word interference seemed to him capable of too wide an interpretation (vide Section 1, the 26th January, 1927). He has now asked us for the terms of our treaties, which he knows leave the rulers in question independent, though they may not hold communication with foreign Powers. But they do hold communications with Ibn Sand. 76. Am I, then, an alarmist when I consider that, with the growth and advance of the Wahabi power, with the activity reported by the political agent (wa# paragraph 61), with the absorption of principalities foreshadowed as possible m paragraph 8 of Foreign Office letter [E 6118/180/91], dated the 3rd November, 1926.* ■ have food for thought. . ^ , . In 1870 Midhat Pasha, Wali of Bagdad, formulated a definite claim to Bahrein as appertaining to the Qaim Majamteq of Nejd, and geographically it belongs to Qatar and Hasa. . . , We have found that the growth of nationalist spirits in China, in Persia, and in the East generally, has produced new circumstances, which we have had, at any rate partially, to accept. Would not the growth of a nationalist Arab and Islamic spirit make our position in Bahrein a matter of considerable difficulty, if that position were left in its present undefined condition. 77. My more definite suggestions in this reference I make in my accompanying despatch on our position with regard to internal affairs in Bahrein. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty s Minister, Tehran. I have, &amp;c. L. HA WORTH, p/e ■ Xlf-i Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Haworth to the Foreign gj r 1, 1927. IN my accompanying despatch No. 294—S, dated to-day, I have dealt at length with the history of Bahrein, the growth of our political interest m it, and. international claims with reference to the archipelago. 1 . , I now propose to deal with the development of our concern m the purely internal affairs of the island up to the present day. , . , , 2. This interest may be said to date from 1877; I quote extensively from Lorimer In 1869, we had installed Sheikh Isa as ruler of the island, and it was entirely, and only, due to our support, that he had been able to keep his position. Since the year mentioned the British Government considered that they were bound ' to prevent grave outrage or oppression by the ruler, or, at any rate, not to remain unconcerned spectators of such acts of violence, but rather use their influence to repress them.' In consequence, the Resident was authorised to convey to Sheikh Isa and to his brother. Sheikh Ahmad, who was his chief adviser and had a stronger character than the sheikh, the emphatic disapproval of Government at an act which the latter had committed in killing a first cousin of the sheikh, and to convey a warning against such conduct in the future. • n i. The above statements are the key to all future developments m Bahiein 3. From 1877 to 1900 we were chiefly concerned with external matters, though attempting with our advice to improve internal conditions. At this time the financial condition of the State seems to have given us most concern, and we were attempting to improve the customs system, which had much leakage. Up to 1879 the Assistant Resident in Bushire occasionally spent some time on thp islands but in 1900, as will be seen in the body of the report, an uncovenanted official was appointed to reside on the island^ By this time Lord Cnrzon was Viceroy and it is probable his interest m the Gulf and Persian affairs focussed our attention on matters connected with it. In 1903, on his visit to Bahrein Lord Curzon considered that an officer of the Political Service would have more influence * See ' Eastern ' volume, Fart XIX, No. 50.13 with the sheikh, and accordingly one was appointed in 1904. From this date our interest in internal matters increased. During the five years of the war no action was taken, but in 1919, probably owing to the treatment of the Shiahs having provoked a protest in Tehran, our immediate interest in the misrule of the State became very much greater, and on our finding Sheikh Isa entirely obstructive he was removed from active control, his son Hamad acting as his deputy. With this short summary T will come to details. 4. In 1880 the sheikh entered into closer relationship with the British by a treaty in which was included a provision by which he agreed to have no negotiations with foreign countries, and in 1892 he made a further and more extended treaty in which he stated he would cede no territory to foreign countries. The protection given by Great Britain to Bahrein resulted in a considerable increase of material prosperity, and our interest, our influence being more and more powerful, was turned to internal improvement and reform, and to precautions against political competition on the part of European Powers. 5. In 1899 differences came to light between Sheikh Isa and his nephew, Ali-bin-Ahmad, son of the Sheikh Ahmad mentioned in paragraph 2, and supplied a possible explanation for the anxiety which Sheikh Isa had displayed to have his son Hamad recognised by the British Government as his heir. Sanction to this recognition—and it is illuminating that such sanction was considered by the sheikh necessary—was granted in 1898, but it was not actually openly announced until 1901, owing to the obstruction by the sheikh to the reform of his customs, from which he was not receiving the value he should have received, the profits going mainly to the customs farmers. 6. In 1899 the British Government offered to lend the sheikh a British customs official, but he declined the offer, the reason being, apparently, that he considered his dignity and independence would be compromised. In the same year, in violation of a promise that he would not extend the current customs contract without reference to the British Resident, Sheikh Isa granted a new lease for two years, and enhanced the general rate of duty from 4 to 5 per cent., without giving previous notice to the British authorities. 7. It was felt that the time had come to replace the Indian agent, who had existed since 1829, by an European officer, and in January 1900 an uncovenanted officer of the Bushire Residency was appointed. In earlier days an Assistant Resident from Bushire had been sent occasionally to reside in the island. 8. The question of the customs was allowed to rest until Lord Curzon's visit to the Persian Gulf in 1903, when it formed the chief subject of discussion between His Excellency the Viceroy and the sheikh. Lord Curzon pressed the customs reforms on the sheikh, but the latter main tained that is was a matter which concerned himself , and there is little doubt that he considered the matter as one affecting his independence. Lord Curzon, however, gave him a final warning that the matter could not, and would not, be dropped. It may be said that in 1901 Sir N. O'Conor had recommended the appointment of a British Director of Customs as a measure which would appear to the Turks a material proof of British authority in Bahrein. To coerce Sheikh Isa into acceptance of reforms would have been easy, but it was thought better that he should consent of his own will. 9. In 1904, after the failure of various attempts to induce the sheikh to agree to a reform of his Customs Administration, a further enhancement of the status of the British representative in the islands was approved of, and in October 1904 a political agent was appointed from the cadre of the Indian Political Department. Lord Curzon had felt, while at Bahrein, that an uncovenanted officer, hailing from India, did not carry the necessary weight with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and it was hoped that a British officer would obtain more influence. 10. Sheikh Isa's conduct, however, left much to be desired, and he seemed more concerned with preserving his independence from us than with conciliating us, by whom only his independence could be maintained. 11. In November 1904 a riot had occurred in which the bodyguard of the sheikh's nephew All attacked the Persians resident in the bazaar at Manameh, the capital of the islands. Captain Prideaux, the new political agent, interviewed the sheikh in the matter, but the sheikh, on the ground that the Persians were Mahometans, declined to admit his interference, and expressed his intention of sending the case to Shara. Ultimately the matter was kept pending until the arrival of the Resident. In the meantime the Persian sufferers had telegraphed to the Shahu and had been informed, in reply, that the British Government would take action on their behalf. An undesirable incident, in which a German was assaulted, occurred about the same time, in which no redress could be obtained. 12. On the 21st January, 1905, the Viceroy despatched a message to the Secretary of State, from which the following is an extract:— ' The incidents reported appear, in our opinion, to warrant and necessitate vigorous measures with sheikh, who is only encouraged in his obstinacy by our continued forbearance. ' His obstinate attitude in regard to proposed customs reforms was explained in our despatch of the 21st April, 1904, and apart from this present case he has shown a disposition to ignore the advice of our new political agent. The appeals for our assistance received from subjects of the German and Persian Governments seem to minimise grounds for any international objection, and makes the present opportunity favourable for proclaiming our protectorate.' 13. The Resident, Major Cox, spent four days discussing the case of the Persians, but without result, the sheikh maintaining that Persians were under his jurisdiction and that the case must be tried by the Bahrein courts. The status of the Persians as foreigners resident upon an island under British protection, together with the certainty of injustice being perpetrated should the case be made over to a Sunni tribunal, forbade any concession on this point. Dead lock ensued, and Major Cox left the island on the 10th December to report the situation to Government. On the 23rd February, 1905, he returned to Bahrein as the bearer of demands authorised by His Majesty's Government upon Sheikh Isa. He had been empowered to enforce compliance with the same by naval force, if necessary, and the British cruiser H.M.S. ' Fox,' and the gunboats H.M.S. ' Redbreast ' and H.M.S. ' Sphinx,' were assembled in the harbour. An ultimatum was delivered to the sheikh, from which the following is an extract of the orders received from Government:—- ' Demands should be prefaced by a reference to the long-continued support accorded to the rulers of Behrein and to the present sheikh by the British Government, who caused the usurper to be expelled, himself to be installed, and the succession of his son to be recognised. ' The sheikh should be reminded of his assurances to follow the advice of the Political Resident.' 14. Government in their memorandum of demands directed the Resident to state :— 'You have not maintained your friendship towards the British Govern ment, and have conducted yourself in a manner which cannot be permitted to continue. In the event of any continuance or repetition of an unfriendly attitude, all support and assistance, whether diplomatic or military, which you, or your predecessors, have enjoyed will be withdrawn from you, and may possibly take another direction.' A warning was conveyed to Hamad, the heir apparent, whose attitude through out the crisis had been as little satisfactory as his father's, that the ultimate recognition of his claims by the Government of India would depend upon his future conduct. 15. In his No. 123, dated the 11th March, 1905, Major Cox stated that he regarded it as a matter of considerable regret that the exigencies of Imperial politics did not admit of our making our moral protectorate into an open and effective one at the present juncture. In a later letter, he stated that he based suggestion he had made on the facts that;— (1.) The Prime Minister in a speech had referred to Bahrein as a British Protectorate. (2.) On the 21st January, 1905, the Government of India had expressed the opinion to the Secretary of State that the present opportunity seemed particularly favourable for proclaiming a protectorate. (3.) On the 22nd February, 1905, His Majesty's Minister for Foreign Affairs intimated to the Turkish Ambassador that it was a matter of commonprotection 6 1116 Island of Bahrein ancl its natives were under British ^ 0 ti!t e ?i 2 T h 4 ug , us V 1895 ' British Ambassador had informed the Porte that all Turkish claims to Bahrein, which was under the protection of the Queen of England, were totally inadmissible. 16. Major Cox had in his letter stated :— tmnnfinn ^? 0 ^ Se ? ^uT ^ ex P ect anything but periodical trouble from a con- tmuation of our laudable endeavour to carry on the government of the islands through the rule of a chief who has shown himself to possess few, if any of the and of trade* 3 neCeSSc lP 7 t ^ e maintenance of order, the security of the person? His Majesty s Government did not accept Major Cox's suggestion, but resolved to follow a more cautious policy. It was decided that for the time being the activity + 0 ; th l™ sl1 P oll tical authorities should be confined to the direction and control of if lir S external relations and that the amelioration of the internal government tru^t of the 0 she^kh indirect and Pacific means and by gaining the confidence and . ^ The position and influence of Great Britain were, however, so Lonmer states undoubtedly consolidated by the crisis of 1904-05 and the relations of the sneikh with the British political agent improved, though the former still regarded oners 01 advice as attempts to undermine his authority. Trade increased by over 50 per cent., but no progress was made in the matter of customs reform. j ^ W i as / £ e ^ t some features of the internal administration were not creditable to the protecting British power '—I quote from Lorimer. The slave trade still flourished and slaves were freely imported from Qatar and atttv . 1 ^ p P re f slon 1 ? f sub j ects was rife not only by the sheikh and the members of the Jvnaliieh, the ruling family, but also by petty magistrates and revenue authorities and specially by the Qazis, who grossly abused their functions. The chief sufferers were the aboriginal cultivating population, called the Bahama, Shiahs by religion, who lived m a condition of virtual serfage and were liable to forced labour and similar hardships. In 1905 the political agent was authorised to manumit slaves in suitable and deserving cases. l 8 - Jn 1906 rumours were current, which were not devoid of foundation, that the sheikh desired to place himself under the protection of Turkey; but in 1909 we were apparently sufficiently pleased with him to raise his salute of guns to eleven. 19 On the 14th September, 1905, however, the Government of India had laid down their idea of their position vis-a-vis Bahrein. They wrote to the Secretary of State that ' Great Britain is the protecting Power of Bahrein, and Bahrein is there- tore under the protection .... of Great Britain in the following sense (1.) The British Government, and they alone, as distinct from Persia, Turkey or any other Power, control the foreign relations of Bahrein. The sheikh has bound himself not to enter into relations with any other Power. The British Government therefore undertake the protection of foreigners. (2.) The reciprocal aspect of this obligation is that Great Britain is bound to protect the islands from any external aggression or assault. (3.) It results that British influence and authority are and must be in the ascendant in Bahrein. This influence is political both in character and origin, and it gives Great Britain the right to claim that in any matter to which she attaches high importance her advice must be followed. The acceptance of this advice is the return paid by the State for the advantages which British protection confers. The British rights were explicitly stated in the ultimatum presented to the sheikh on the 24th February, 1905. If British advice must be accepted, action in contravention of it' whether it takes the form of vacillation, bad faith, or open contumacy cannot be tolerated. ' (4.) British paramountcy is commercial as well as political.' 20. After the event of 1904-05 the political agent, though not directly empowered by an Order in Council, assumed jurisdiction over foreigners (an Order m Council to rectify this was introduced in 1919). J!)16 Sheikh Isa, though he agreed to the right of protection in the case of other foreigners, maintained his own right over Nejdis. . „ , , , In 1917 the political agent suggested we might fall in with this view 01 tne s ei as a graceful concession, and this appears to have been acted on unoihcially up o 1920. 21. Except as above, the internal affairs of Bahrein do not appear to have attracted much attention until the end of the Great War. . The political agent found himself powerless to prevent the many gross tyrannies which were being perpetrated, but used his influence as far as he could to preven certain stbusos In 1908 the political agent attempted to improve trade conditions, and in 1910 he reported that the utmost patience had been exercised in order to get the snei o agree without coercion to some compromise to meet the requirements of traders wi regard to landing arrangements, which he leased as a monopoly. 22. In 1911 the political resident again gave a gloomy picture of the condition of the Bahrein principality due to the incompetence of Sheikh Isa. . , He said that all progress was hampered by the bigoted incapacity of the sheikn,. to which was to be added the nationalist sentiment which had agitated Islam during the past two or three years. He was of the opinion that Government would have o interfere in the interests of our shipping. •+ ui In 1912 the Government of India called upon the sheikh to form a suitable scheme for the landing of cargo, a reform which was suitably carried through. 23. On the outbreak of war the attitude of the sheikh and his two sons was friendly, but the inhabitants of Bahrein were, perhaps naturally, affected by their Islamic sentiment. The arrest of Wonckhaus' agent and the capture of Basra had a quieting eltect. During the war internal affairs necessarily received little attention. In 1912 Sheikh Isa agreed to the erection of a wireless station in Bahrein, and in 1916, on the departure of the sheikh's quarantine officer on leave, we took over the quarantine duties of the place, a duty which we have continued to perform. In 1915 Sheikh Isa was invested with C.S.I.. and in 1919 with the K.G1.K 24. In May 1919 Captain Bray, who had been for six months political agent, accompanied Sheikh Isa's second son, Sheikh Abdulla, to England. ^ • -d -u • Captain Bray considered that there was some anti-British feeling m Bahrein, that there was no British party, and he considered the activities of the American missionaries to be anti-British. While this is not the case directly, indirectly it must 1^0 SO. 25 Captain Bray, the first of a series of officers from Iraq, was very much in favour of an up-to-date Bahrein, with water works, electric power, industrial schools, pearl button manufactures, &amp;c. . , , .i The deputy resident, Mr. Bill, was not, however, m favour of these improve ments, preferring rather to leave the Arab to develop slowly than to inculcate in him a divine discontent. 26. Six months later Major Dickson reported (1.) Political situation wholly unsatisfactory. (2.) Strong, long-standing and deep-seated anti-British sentiment. (3.) British prestige rests on fear and not on respect. He also stated that Sheikh Isa was a very old and weak man with sincere feelings of friendship for His Majesty s Government, but easily swayed and confused in his judgment by astute minds and intrigues, dictated for the most Pa rt by ^ten- tions evil to him and to us. It is amusing to note that as far back as 1898-99 Colonel Meade referred to Sheikh Isa as a very old man with a weak character. About the same time Government interfered in a difference between bheikh isa and Ibn Sand regarding the duties to be charged on goods proceeding to Hasa. Sheikh Isa was compelled to accept 2 per cent, duty, much to his chagrin, as e considered Government had favoured Ibn Sand at his expense. 27 In the meantime. Sheikh Abdulla had visited England and had an interview with Sir Arthur Hartzel. which was illuminating with regard to the sheikh's feelings. Sheikh Abdulla asked that— (1) Sheikh Isa should be put on an equality with neighbouring Arab rulers m the exercise of authority over all persons except subjects of Great Britain and the Great European Powers Nejdis and Persians, &amp;c.) -17 I / (2.) Sheikh Isa should be empowered to select the bench of magistrates. (3.) Sheikh Isa should be given a port at Zubarah in Qatar. (4.) Sheikh Isa should be given, permission to correspond direct with London. I need not dilate on the last two points. The first two were part of the sentiment for which Sheikh Isa had been fighting throughout, that is to say, his pride of position with his fellow Arabs and his idea of his independence. 28. During 1920 the question of jurisdiction over Nejdis and the people of Hasa had caused some friction between Sheikh Isa and the political agent. On the 5th May, 1920, the Secretary of State for India informed Sheikh Abdulla by letter, through the usual sources, that, with reference to his first demand of the previous year, quoted above, the Government agreed that the Sheikh of Bahrein should exercise jurisdiction over the subjects of other Arab rulers, provided that the rulers themselves concurred, but on the 8th of the same month the political agent had already stated that Ibn Sand objected to the sheikh controlling his subjects, and in July reported that Ibn Sand had in writing requested him to exercise the jurisdiction in question. The Sheikh of Qatar sent a similar request. The political agent accordingly issued a notice on the 20th November, 1920, that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab rulers and chiefs other than those of Bahrein, are, while residing in Bahrein, entitled to the protection of His Majesty's Government. Thus jurisdiction over all foreigners passed to the political assent. The situation naturally caused friction with Sheikh Isa and left him smarting. 29. In 1921 Major Daly, who had succeeded as political agent, summed up the situation in Bahrein in the following terms :— ' Sheikh Isa's wife holds a regular court and imprisons and punishes at her will, with a total disregard of the most elementary laws of even Arab justice. The Salifeh divan court has degenerated into a single venal judge owing to Sheikh Isa having become deeply indebted to Rashid-bin-Mohanna .... a disturbing element is the rapid increase of the family of A1 Khalifeh. There is no outlet for the many younger members and no attempt is made to educate them for any occupation.' Major Daly had previously reported the gross oppression practised on the Shiahs by the A1 Khalifeh, and especially by Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Isa, who had his father and mother's complete confidence and consequently ruled Bahrein. 30. In 1921 the rising discontent frightened Sheikh Abdulla, and Sheikh Isa appointed his heir Sheikh Hamad to take over the control of affairs under his orders, but Sheikh Isa's wife, the mother of Abdulla, kept such a tight hand over things that Sheikh Hamad was powerless to make any changes. In December 1921 discontent in Bahrein had reached such a pitch that, as the Resident reported to the Government of India, a deputation of Bahreinis presented him with an appeal against the tyranny existing. The Resident, Colonel Trevor, suggested that the political agent should be authorised to intervene in cases of glaring tyranny and to give individual protection pending enquiry when necessary. 31. Sheikhs Hamad and Abdulla took alarm at the attitude of the people and on the 11th April, 1922, Major Daly was able to report that the sheikhs appeared anxious for reform, as the Shiahs were becoming restive. He had warned Sheikh Isa that he could expect no assistance in the event of disturbances. He also reported that orders had been passed for the opening of a Government office with two regular clerks for dealing with public business, and that a regular court had been established for the disposal of cases. 32. On this the Government informed the Resident that they did not desire to be drawn into interference between the ruler of Bahrein and his subjects .... that nothing should be done to encourage the idea that the reforms were being introduced at Government dictation. The political agent reported that the sheikhs, frightened at the attitude of the Sunnis, had drawn back from their reforms, and that some Shiahs were advocating open rebellion and were said to be importing arms. A week later, in July 1922, the Government of India asked the Resident whether, as the sheikh would not act, pressure should not be applied owing to the gross injustice and the victimisation of Shiahs. [169 1 0] dIS 33. On the 7th December, 1922, the Foreign Office, London, informed the India Oxfice that they desired to express their earnest hope that steps might be taken forthwith for the introduction at Bahrein of reforms tending to ensure the equitable treatment of Shiahs. My files do not show it, but I understand that Shiah pressure was being exercised through the Persian Government at Tehran. Colonel Knox, who was Acting Resident in 1923 at the time the reforms were finally put through, was not in favour of our pressing reforms on Sheikh Isa, as he considered the Persian challenge was directed not against our conduct of affairs in Bahrein but against our position there, and that reforms would not placate Persia but would provoke the larger issue. He pointed out in this reference that if we withdrew from Bahrein it would not be Persia but the Wahabis who would succeed us. 34. In January 1923 Major Daly reported that Sheikh Isa was purely obstructive in matters to the advantage of the State, and amongst them would never agree to the exploration for oil except under pressure. Colonel Trevor then reported that the state of affairs in Bahrein called for reform more urgently than ever. 35. On the 17th April, 1923, the Government of India wired to London urging reforms, since misrule had reached such a pitch, but said : 'In the present temper of Islam we are anxious to use every endeavour to induce Sheikh Isa to act ostensibly in his own interest and wish to avoid overt intimidation .... failing that, if it means his enforced retirement and deportation of Sheikh Abdulla we are determined to carry out the reforms ourselves .... such action would almost certainly force the general issue of our status in Bahrein, and might produce an unfavourable reaction on Ibn Sand, but we presume His Majesty's Government are prepared to face the consequences.' In reply, the Secretary of State gave the required authority to convey a categorical warning to Sheikh Isa. 36. A further disturbance between some Nejdis and Persians took place in which five people were killed, which assisted Colonel Knox when on the 15th May, 1923, he crossed to Bahrein to take action. He stated Sheikh Hamad's great fear was of Ibn Saud; and he reported his own anticipation that the whole management of affairs would more and more come into the hands of the political agent. 37. On the 20th May Colonel Knox had an interview with Sheikh Isa. He told him that the Government were much concerned at the condition in Bahrein, and that we were committed to a serious course of reforms, and advised him to stand aside and give Sheikh Hamad a free hand. Sheikh Isa was obdurate, and on the 23rd May Colonel Knox asked Sheikh Hamad and Sheikh Abdulla to make one last effort to induce Sheikh Isa to agree to his measures. On the 26th May Sheikh Isa was set aside, as far as control over matters was concerned, and his son Hamad appointed to rule for him. Sheikh Hamad, though well-meaning, was without experience, and had the weak character of his father, though perhaps without so much obstinacy. Consequently, for the next four years he took no step without the help or, indeed, advice of the political agent, and his complete lack of initiative forced Major Daly into the foreground. 38. In June 1923 the Government of India wrote the first of their repeated warnings that the political agent must be on his guard against being tempted to interfere too much and too directly in the sheikh's affairs or to become the administrative officer rather than the adviser. Colonel Knox pointed out that to evolve order out of chaos steps had to be taken, and that both Sheikh Hamad and Major Daly were in bad odour in consequence of the reforms having been established. 39. Sheikh Isa then appealed to the High Commissioner at Bagdad. The Sunni tribes were opposed to these reforms, and in November 1923 petitioned Colonel Trevor on his return to the Persian Gulf. On the other hand. Sheikh Hamad and Sheikh Abdulla asked Colonel Trevor if he would permanently appoint a British customs director for Bahrein. Colonel Trevor supported their request, and also recommended the raising of a small force of Baluchis to maintain order, along with other local reforms, such as law courts, &amp;c. Colonel Trevor pointed out this would entail the employment of three British officers, and that without them the reforms could not be carried out.19 Hnnfr? T.! 7 ' the ( |^ vernment of India asked the Kesident whether he was not in t2ZtL g T^r t k beyond what was laid down by them, and stated that they desired the sheikh to- be actively associated with the measures of amelioration and not merely to fodow passively m the wake of changes pressed upon them. They asked whether an Arab from Irak or Egypt could not function as director of customs It is unnecessary to go into the further correspondence on the subiect. 40. In January 1924 Mr. de Grenier took over the appointment of director of customs and in the same year a corps of Baluchis was raised under a British officer administration Ser Was a PP ointed . who deals with judicial, financial and general or • the course of a compilation of a record of rights, it came to light that feheikh Isa had frequently sold the same plot twice to different people and had given documents for land included m the property of others. 41. Outrages against life and property now began to be common, of which the*alKhallfeh 7 ^ hiS SOnS ' members of Slleikh Isa ' s f amily, n T 4 ?.- , 0r l the |4tli July, 1924, the Foreign Secretary wrote that ' the Government of India had no desire to proceed further or faster than they could carry the sheikh wholeheartedly with them. They think the political agent and the political resident India 8 a ten nc ^ to treat t ^ e island too much on the lines of a native State in Colonel Prideaux reported that he had obtained the impression that Sheikh Hamad wholeheartedly approved of the reforms. 43. On the 13th February, 1925, Sheikh Isa submitted an appeal to his -Excellency the Viceroy against his deposition. Jn.it he says, 'the ' reforms ' which my subjects did not want or demand, and which, indeed, they condemned, took the form of forcing on me inadmissible demands tor concessions to foreign syndicates.' u ^ al ^ ) re . f&lt; ? rs t0 th , e ^solutions passed by his chiefs of tribes, of which one was that the British consul should abide by the contents of the treaty contracted between affairs 1 ' 1 ' 1 Governinent and tliat of Bahrein and should not meddle with internal He concluded:— It is against .... the intolerable persecution to which I myself have been subjected in breach of treaty obligations in the matter of my prerogatives as an independent ruler of Bahrein that I seek protection and redress at vour Excellency s hands.' J 44 At the beginning of Sheikh Hamad's rule affairs in Bahrein were in chaos. JJisturbances which owed their inception to the party which desired Sheikh Isa and niisiule, were rife, and finally an attempt was made on Sheikh Hamad's life 45. In 1926 the subahdar commanding the Baluch levies was killed by one of the sepoys in the force, and Major Daly was attacked and wounded. I consider that this incident, though it had some connection with the general unrest, need not e considered politically. It had no Arab significance, except as a symptom of general conditions; it was not due to the causes which preceded the attempt on Sheikh Hamad's life. r td T h?^ ch Levy Cor P s was ' however, abolished, and an armed police corps of Punjab Mahometans enlisted, again under a British officer. 46 To-day Bahrein is quiet. Sheikh Isa meets the political resident and the political agent, and he draws his allowance. The Dowasir tribe, who left Bahrein are coming back again on the conditions which we named, and we are attempting more and more to make Sheikh Hamad the obvious head of the State. 47. But it is still obvious to the world that Sheikh Hamad does what the political agent wants him, that he frequently does what he does not want, because tne political agent tells him—we should say advises him. A glaring example of this is the Dowasir case, in which the Dowasir and all the island knew that Sheikh Hamad's sympathies were with the expelled tribe and he joined with that tribe to obtain Ibn Sand's recommendation to us in order to make easier his task of obtaining their return to Bahrein. 48. In the meantime we have a British administrator, a servant of the State who sits with Sheikh Hamad on tribunals; we have the customs director and the chief o police, all of whom were appointed by the British Government though under Sheikh Hamad's signature. ' 8 [ 1 6910] d 220 The British are still looked upon as the rulers, and how indeed can it be otherwise? We make and unmake rulers, we appoint administrators and officials. Every important point is referred to us—the question of landing charges, readmission of the Dowasir, arrival of foreigners, visit of the sheikh to Qatar, &amp;c. 49. Now on reading the history of the last 100 years it is not difficult to see how the present situation has come about, nor the causes of the differences which have occurred between the sheikh and the political agent, the difference of outlook of Sheikh Isa and Lord Curzon. 60. In the course of putting down piracy we were bound to take an interest in Bahrein affairs, for we could not allow the islands to fall into the hands of a foreign Power who might allow it to be a centre of disorder. In 1843 we allowed the sheikh to be ousted as we did not find him satisfactory, and he was replaced by us by another who was equally unsatisfactory, and who finally fled in 1868. We then recognised Sheikh All, who was killed by usurpers, whom we defeated and deported, and we ithen installed his son Isa in his place in 1869, and in 1923 we deposed Sheikh Isa and again appointed his son to rule. 51. During all this time we have protected the State from outside encroach ment, and since the sheikh was put and kept in his place by our power we have felt some responsibility for his internal administration and have felt that common gratitude on his part must give us some rights of advice. We have, however, always publicly insisted upon his independence and he has imbibed the idea of the fact that he is independent. 52. But with an uneducated Arab tribesman independence means the power to do many things of which we do not approve. It means administering the islands for the benefit of the chiefs of the tribe to which he belongs, it means—as it means in many native States in India—the exploiting of the people for the rulers, it means to a bigoted Sunni the treating of the Shiahs as people of an unprivileged class (as we see to-day in Ibn Saud's country, 50 miles away on the mainland), it means justice tempered with a consideration of the position of the ruling tribes, and to a man of 60, as Sheikh Isa was when the first crisis occurred, it means an abhorrence of all newfangled ideas. Thus the more we insisted, the more he felt his position threatened, and the more he resisted. The trouble that came was bound to come if we desired a clean administration and elementary justice. Indeed Colonel Knox, knowing the type of man and the civilisation with which we had to deal, pointed out when the reforms were made that it was inevitable that the power should fall more and more into the hands of the political agent, at any rate for some years. 53. But we have already had, in the past, our experience of trying to work by merely advising, and the Government, not the political agent, finally had to insist on threats instead of advice. Sheikh Hamad is a pleasant man but a weak one, and it is idle to pretend that he and his brothers would not backslide. He has already shown that he is very much liable to the influence of Ibn Sand and to other Arab influences. He has stated that he looks to Ibn Sand as the great Arab ruler whom they would all wish to please. He, in a way, likes the British officers he meets, but he, like every other Arab sheikh, would gladly be rid of us all and go back to his definite Arab ways amongst his fellow Arabs. 54. The question then is what are we going to do, now that Bahrein is, however little we may desire it or have desired it, administered as a British province, for apart from the British employees, the Levy Corps is entirely Indian and we have nearly completed a revenue survey carried out by Indian surveyors. 55. I am separately from this despatch submitting suggestions for the reduction of the number of the British employees and we are doing all we can to induce Sheikh Hamad to accept the responsibilities of the post which he holds. 56. But the reforms which we have introduced are essentially Western in ethics and in principle, and foreign to the Eastern mentality of an Arab sheikh. To relax too much, to allow Sheikh Hamad his way, means to go through the same grind through which we have come, and we cannot afford to-day, any more than in the past, to let Bahrein come under the influence of any other Power, Eastern or Western. It must be remembered that only in 1906, thirty-seven years after we had put Sheikh Isa on the throne, and after we alone had kept him from annexation, and notwithstanding our treaties with him, he had ideas of acceoling Turkish nationality., ^ 7 - Bahrein is more important to us that it ever has been. There is little doubt that with the development of Persia our strength on that coast will be weakened It is for us to see that it is not weakened with the Arabs as well. -D i, • . rs ^ ai1 18 vital to us as a point on the line from which our oil comes Bahrein is a keypomt on the air route to India and the East, and without it we could not maintain a service. We cannot lose Bahrein. But notwithstandine; our outwardly strong position on the islands, a single serious quarrel with Sheikhs Isa and Hamad, a quarrel engineered by Ibn Sand on religious grounds, or through .Persian on political grounds, and we should have to vacate our privileffed position or force ourselves on the principality in the face of the world, against the wishes of its rulers The fact that under treaty the ruler is not allowed to correspond with foreign Powers has not prevented him from so doing in the past and would not do so m the future. 58 - Jn bygone days, in 1849, we did not take over Bahrein when it was offered to us by Sheikh Mohammed because of the commitments it would give us in administration and defence. To-day our position in the islands is accepted by the Arabs, and wc have accepted the commitments in administration, and we should have equally to accept the commitments for defence if Bahrein were threatened. Indeed, I am separately suggesting it as a naval base and the headquarters of our squadron in the Persian Gulf. 59. The objections to a protectorate are purely political; they are no longer administrative. But Sheikh Hamad knows that he cannot stand without us, and, indeed, I would say that, notwithstanding his personal outlook, he is content to keep us there for that reason. His state of mind is a mixed one to be swayed either way by the course of events. At present, though turning towards Ibn Saud in his personal feelings, he looks towards us, and has no desire for the rigid strictness of Wahabi rule. 60. I would suggest then that Sheikh Hamad should be induced to approach us saying that he fears the political situation, and would be glad if we would extend to him the protection which was refused to his predecessor in 1849. With the consolidation of our position we could afford to cut down the British staff to one man, and insist that Sheikh Hamad should make all the show of a rulership, as in an Indian State, since our position would be unassailable except by force. 61. The protectorate thus concluded need not be proclaimed for the moment if it is not desired, but it would legalise and consolidate a position which is loose and uncertain. I cannot, personally, face with equanimity a future based on the present circumstances of world politics, especially of Eastern politics, and the conditions under which we are now tolerated in Bahrein, conditions which with the advance of the Wahabi power might, in place of a willing subordination, become a forcible bond founded on no right with a hostile people in open sympathy with an advancing Islamic power. 62. We are losing our position in the northern coast of the Gulf; we shall equally lose it in the southern if we allow Ibn Saud to consolidate his power on the whole southern littoral. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. I have, &amp;c. L. HA WORTH, Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Haworth to the Foreign (Confidential.) • / ' / ' 3 0 i Sir, 10, 1927. I HAVE the honour to state that in my despatches of the 30th April and the 9th May last, and in my despatch dated the 1st September, 1927, I have throughout advocated some advance in the policy which we have hitherto followed in the Persian * This despatch was received later than Sir R a Olive's despatch, but is printed with it for facility of reference.Gulf, and I think that some explanation is required of my reasons for the suggestions I have made. 2. Our interest in the Persian Gulf dates from 1616. In 1615 it had been necessary to find markets for our surplus goods in the factory at Surat, and in 1616 the ship ' James ' sailed for Persia with a mission to Persia, headed by Edward Connock, and with cargo. The result was that in 1624 we established a factory at Bunder Abbas. Thus our first interest in the Gulf was purely commercial. 3. For the next 150 years our commerce was mixed with war either with the Portuguese, Dutch or French, and our commerce sailed either in armed ships or under armed convoys, and the factories we established in 1643 at Basra and in 1763 at Bushire were protected by military guards. 4. When the danger from European countries ceased, we still had the same problem in guarding our commerce from the Arab pirates, chiefly the Jowasim, and in the common interest of the Gulf we established a police of the Indian navy, which had by this time been formed. Thus in a despatch to Sir Henry Willock, dated the 3rd October, 1820, the Bombay Government state :— 'You will be pleased to avail yourself of the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government that as our views are exclusively limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation we formerly offered between His Majesty and the Utubis of Bahrein.' 5. In 1820-21 Sir Montstuart Elphinstone made the following note :— ' On the other hand, all the officers—political, naval and military—who have been employed in the Gulf, are of the opinion that without a station in this part of the sea we shall never be able to eradicate piracy . . . .' From this arose our station at Basidu, which we finally evacuated, mainly on account of climate. 6. In 1822-23 the Governor of Bombay observed with regard to the charges against Captain Bruce in connection with the treaty he had made :— ' The object of the British Government was to preserve the peace of the Gulf, as it was owing to the wars among the Powers who inhabit its shores that the growth of piracy was encouraged.' Thus, from 1820 to 1869, our policy was dictated by the suppression of piracy and the prevention of wars of which piracy was a by-product. All our agreements with the sheikhs of the Trucial Coast, Qatar and Bahrein, were to this end. 7. In 1869 we informed the Persian Government that— ' The sole object of the British Government in holding the sheikhs (of Bahrein) to these engagements were the prevention of piracy and the slave trade, and the maintenance of the police of the Gulf—duties of which Great Britain would gladly, if it were possible, divest herself in favour of Persia.' Our interests were still those of commerce. 8. But in 1880 Russia began to take an interest in the Persian Gulf, and in 1881 established a Russian consulate in Bagdad. From 1888 onwards the dominant note in political affairs in Persia was the opposition existing between Great Britain and Russia, and there were indications of a joint policy, adverse to Great Britain, on the part of France and Russia. 9. From 1894-99, as Lorimer says, was one of incipient movements gathering force which were after its close to invest the Persian Gulf with prominence. The chief factors were the understanding between Russia and France, and foreign schemes for a railway to connect the Mediterranean with the Persian Gulf. A fresh indication of the strategical importance attached by Russia to the straits forming the entrance to the Persian Gulf, was afforded by the journey of a Russian engineer officer, who came by Kerman and Bunder Abbas to Hormuz in the spring of 1895; he remained for two days, made a survey of Hormuz, and at his departure gave it to be understood that the island would be made a Russian coaling station. 10. This brings us to Lord Curzon's Viceroyalty of 1899-1905.1 &gt; 23 In his book ' Persia and the Persian Question,' published in 1892, Lord Curzon had written;— ' It is no exaggeration to say that the lives and properties of hundreds of thousands of human beings are' secured by this British protectorate of the Persian Gulf, and that were it either withdrawn or destroyed, both sea and shore would relapse into the anarchical chaos from which they have so laboriously been reclaimed. That the Persian Government has been enabled to reassert its authority upon the northern littoral, that the pirates of the opposite coast have been taught that rapine is not a safe religion, and, where they once swept the sea with laden slave dhows now dive harmlessly for pearls; that the Arab tribes, instead of being subjected to the curse of Pashas, retain the liberty they so dearly prize, is due to the British Government alone. .... But at least she must, and does, claim, in return for the sacrifices to which she has submitted, and the capital which she has sunk, and for the sake of the peace which she is here to guard, that no hostile political influence shall introduce its discordant features upon the scene. A Russian port in the Persian Gulf , that dear dream of so many a patriot from the Neva and the Volga, would, even in times of peace, import an element of unrest into the life of the Gulf that would shake the delicate equilibrium so laboriously established, would wreck a commerce that is valued at many millions sterling, and would let loose again the passions of jarring nationalities only too ready to fly at each other's throats. Let Great Britain and Russia fight their battles or compose their differences elsewhere, but let them not turn into a scene of sanguinary conflict the peaceful field of a hard-won trade. I should regard the concession of a port upon the Persian Gulf to Russia by any Power as a deliberate insult to Great Britain, as a wanton rupture of the status quo, and an intentional provocation to war; and I should impeach the British Minister, who was guilty of acquiescing in such a surrender, as a traitor to his country.' 11. In 1899-1900 it was clear that the predominance of the British Government in the Persian Gulf was threatened, that with this the security of British India was being endangered by the policy of foreign Powers, especially Russia, France and Germany. The naval designs of Russia in the Persian Gulf, and her railway schemes in Persia, the French project of a naval base in the Gulf of Oman, and the powers acquired by Germany for constructing a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, were all circumstances of serious import. 12. Our interests in the Persian Gulf were no longer commercial only; they had also become political; and in 1903, Lord Lansdowne, in reply to a question from Lord Lamington, said :— ' I do not yield to the noble lord in the interest which I take in the Persian Gulf, or in the feeling that this country stands, with regard to the navigation of the Persian Gulf, in a position different from that of any other Power. The noble lord told your lordships, with absolute truth, that it was owing to British enterprise, to the expenditure of British lives and money, that the Persian Gulf is at this moment open to the navigation of the world. It was our ships that cleared these waters of pirates; it was we who put down the slave trade; it was we who buoyed and beaconed those intricate waters In the third place—I say it without hesitation—we should regard the establishment of a naval base or a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal. I say that in no minatory spirit, because, so far as I am aware, no proposals are on foot for the establishment of a foreign naval base in the Persian Gulf.' 13. This was, then, our position up to 1914, the year of the war, during which we occupied Basra. As a result of the war we obtained a mandate for Iraq, Czarist Russia and Turkey disappeared from the scene, and there was consequently no danger, for the moment, of a foreign occupation in the Persian Gulf. As a consequence, the importance of this area was temporarily dimmed. 14. But in the meantime the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had developed their operations, Abadan had been built, and a large part of the oil and petrol which supplies our fleet and our home country was being prepared at the head of the Persian Gulf.24 f \ It also became apparent that the Persian Gulf, lying as it does between Iraq and Jndia, was of first-class importance strategically in connection with the air route to the East, and that, since Persia could not be depended upon as a country on that route, the Arab coast was of vital importance to us. 15. Consequently, the southern coast, with the sheikhs of which in bygone days we had been obliged to make treaties for the safety of the seas, now became the important item in the route for aeroplanes. We had been content in the past to make general treaties, but it had been our object to avoid occupation of any part of the coast, since with regard to our troops, ' Our stationing them on the continent, either of Persia or Arabia, could not fail sooner or later to involve us in the politics of those countries.' 16. But again our circumstances have changed. To-day we are involved in the politics of those countries. In the past our policy has been to avoid protectorates. Can we continue to follow this policy ? Two lines of action lie open to us to meet the new situation :— (i.) To continue as we are, to await a period of war, if it comes, when we can, as in the last war, seize such vantage points aswe may desire. (ii.) To prepare the ground beforehand and acquire definite ^protectorate^ or (&amp;) protection over the countries which we know we shall require. 17. We are, as I have pointed out elsewhere, and as is apparent, losing, with the development of Persia, our strong position on the Persian coast. We cannot afford to do the same on the southern coast. Whatever may be the position with Ibn Sand on the Hasa coast, we have already established that we can use the Arab air route with a three-engined machine, or in time of war, strategically, with any machine, by making a few necessary arrangements. 18. But if we allow Ibn Saud to acquire the Arab sheikhdoms of the coast, this statement no longer holds good and our line is cut. Thus, to have matters as they are is no longer possible; we must have a stronger hold on the sheikhs. Similarly, we must occupy the MassandanvPeninsula in order to hold the Gulf and protect the egress of our oil and petrol. The above, then, is the foundation upon which I have made the recommendations which I have written. 19. But it is also to be remembered that we may not always hold the mandate for Iraq. We may find our position in Iraq that which it is in Persia. How much the more necessary is it for us to be established at Bahrein and the mouth of the Persian Gulf at Khassab \ Bahrein has an excellent protected harbour to be made at a small cost, has a better climate than the Massandan Peninsula, and should be the headquarters of our fleet, at any rate in peace time. What should be the headquarters in war time it is for the navy to decide. In the above I have left out Muscat, with its possessions of Gwadur, &amp;c., since they are not definitely situated in the Persian Gulf. Muscat is, in fact, as definitely a protectorate of ours as is Bahrein, though neither are officially acknowledged, and the question of Muscat has certain complica tions, such as foreign treaties. It is, however, connected with the same political issues of defence, of India and the air route. The Sultan only continues ruling because he has our support, and I think there is little, doubt that political events will force us to admit officially the protectorate of the coast of Oman, which in practice exists to-day.

I would then suggest that if you agree I obtain a document from Shaikh Hamad countersigned tey Shaikh Isa authori sing us to defend their independence from Persia before the Geneva Convention and if possible stating their dependence on our protection. With this and our position in Bahrain for 100 years and especially our suzerain acts in Bahrain for last 60 years (i.e. since last theoretical occupation by Persia) including imposition of present de jure and de facto rulers Persian Government should have no case.

Clive to Sir Austen Ch — 12.) (No. 577.) Sir, 25, 1927. WITH reference to my telegram No. 223 of the 24th November, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a note from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs embodying a formal protest by the Persian Government against article 6 of the treaty with His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and Nejd signed at j P Jeddah on the 20th May, 1927. 2. It cannot cause surprise that the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over Bahrein should be reasserted in this form since, in spite of this claim having been repudiated on many occasions between 1822 and the present day, it has never been specifically abandoned by the Persian Government. The undertaking given by the King of the Hejaz to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territory of Bahrein embodied in this treaty, if it had been allowed to pass unques tioned by the Persian Government, would have very materially weakened their pretensions to maintain such a claim to sovereignty in the future. Nor is it perhaps surprising that the Persian Government have referred in their note to the reply given by Lord Clarendon to the Persian protest of 1869 which, as was pointed out by His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire in the most useful review of our relations with Bahrein contained in his despatch to the Government of India, No. 294 of the 1st September last (a copy of which formed the first enclosure to my despatch No. 484 of the 7th October) was somewhat equivocal in its terms. The general attitude of His Majesty's Government on this question is doubtless unaltered since the date of the Marquess Curzon's instructions to my predecessor embodied in paragraph 6 of his despatch No. 480 of the 31st October, 1923. We have now, however, a new feature to deal with—the notification of the matter to the League of Nations and the reference to article 10 of the Covenant. 3. I am inclined to think that the Persian Government have made a tactical error in referring the question to the League of Nations at this stage. It would have been cleverer, it appears to me, to have awaited our inevitable repudiation of their claim before doing so. It seems now open to His Majesty's Government to leave the matter to the League to deal with, and it may be hoped that a statement of the British case before that body will lead to the shadowy Persian pretensions being disposed of once for all. I am aware that in the early part of 1926 you were loth to bring this question before the League for settlement. I take it, however, that the fact that it is Persia who has raised the matter removes the more serious of the objections which you saw to the proposal when it was made in 1926. Direct treatment of the matter here between this Legation and the Persian Government would almost certainly lead to an unsatisfactory and inconclusive battle of words, which would be particularly embarrassing' at the present time when the proposals of His Majesty's Government for the conclusion of a new treaty and the settlement of our main outstanding questions are about to be presented to the Persian Government. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and of its enclosure to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty's Acting High Commissioner for Iraq and to His Majesty's consul-general at Bushire. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. Enclosure in No. 1. Note from the Acting Minister for R. M le Ministre pl&amp;iipotentiaire, 30, 1306 22, 1927). INFORMATION has reached the Persian Government that in article 6 of the treaty concluded at Jeddah on the 20th May, 1927, between Sultan Abdul-Aziz Sooud [324 m—1]3 and the British Government, is stated: 'His Majesty the King of Hejaz an Neid, &amp;c., undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with tne terri tories of Koweit, Bahrein and with the Sheikhs of Katar and the coast ox Oman w o have special treatv relations with the British Government.' . In view of the fact that the proprietorship of the Persian Government over Bahrein is established, and at the time of the conclusion of the private treaty between the British Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein the Persian Government ha , by right, made a protest (against it), and Lord Clarendon, in his reply to tne Persian Minister in London on the 29th April, 1869, had formally considered that pro es well founded, you will admit that the above-mentioned article is, as far as it re ers o Bahrein, contrary to the territorial integrity of Persia and prejudicial to e goo relations (which have) always existed between two friendly neighbouring coun ries. Under the circumstances my Government strongly protests against that part oi the above-mentioned treaty and expects the British Government to take necessaiy steps, as soon as possible, for the deletion of that part. I have the honour to inform you that in view of the fact that my Government is a member of the League of Nations, and in view of article 10 of the fundamental rules of the League, which guarantee the territorial integrity of the States of its members, a copy of this note will be sent to the League with the suggestion that the protest of the Persian Government in this matter should be taken into consideration.

A copy of that letter is now en closed. 4. Government will perceive that the Persian Eoreign Minister pretends that Bahrein 'is the.property of Persia'. The British GovernmentGovernment hold an emphatically opposite opinion? as appear from the subjoined extracts from a series of letters?- Sir Charles .food, to His IXcellency the Governor of Bombay, '&gt;10.2, dated 18th February 1861.-'Bahrein should be regarded as independent, and subject neither to Turkey nor to Persia'.

On a subsequent occasion it was laid down 'by the Govern .ent of Vide Mr.Secretary Goldsmid's letter Ho.166,3e-• India that Her cret Department,dated 3ist May 1853, to Gap- tain A.E .Kemhall,Resident,Persian Gulf,and Majesty's Govern enclosure,from Government of India,Ho.177, of 10th May 1853. -ment would not admit of the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Government,or by any one acting for it or in its interests,'and 'consequently, that the Government of India should offer every obstacle to an attack upon that island by the Wahabee Chief'. Again, Mr.Alison, in his letter to this Office Ho.25, of 26th July 1862, considered himself 'Preciuded, under instructions from the foreign Office, from entering into any discussions on the subject of -'Bahrein with the Pet si an Government'. 5. The Persian foreign Minister pretends that 'the right of Persia over the Ports of Omman' (Omman, including the Muscat territories, and a portion of the Arab littoral known as the Pirate Coast, and along which are located many independent Arab Chiefs with whom we have treaty engagements,) is a treaty stip- / ulation between England and Persia. If so, I must plead igno rance of the fact, nor can I suppose that Government would, for an instant, acknowledge any alleged claim on the part of Persia to sovereignty over Muscat and our Arab Chiefs. 6, The Persian Foreign Minister would pretend to dread that we may use force against Persian Islands. The simple reply to this is, that 'Persia owes the possibility of trade in the Gulf and the tranquillity of her Gulf littoral wholly to the British Maritime Police of the Gulf. Persia has not a gun afloat to pro tect her own shore, and the Arab chiefs have, on more than one occasion, expostulated with me for preventing their old sea raids, and have frankly admitted that, if it were not for the British Resident, they would seize every Persian merchant craft and plunder the Persian sea-ports. My opinion, based on many years'! observation and experience, is that, if we were to abandon our maritime protection of the Persian Gulf, trade in these waters would soon become impossible, and the ports on the Persian li ttoral(TXT) littoral would become subjects to hostile attack, and, perhaps, fall into the hands of Arab Chiefs. 1 - &gt; ' ^* It is remarkable that, while the Persian Foreign Minister would pretend to dread violence on our part towards Keshtn and ormuz, the ersian Governor General of tJouthern Persia is ir 1 '* debted to me for having placed a gun-boat and the 1st Assistant Vide my Reports Uos.32 and 45,dated respectively Residert at 4th and 23rd April,and Ho.52,dated 9th May 1663. ilis di S p 0Sa ;L y in view to enabling him to inspect those islands. His Royal Highness has, as Government are aware, expressed his thanks and satisfaction for-the same. 8. I observe that the foreign Minister incidentally refers to vide my letcers wo.115,of 1st December 1866,and Angaum as a lTo.14, of 16th January 1867. Persian island. Since the date of my letters now noted, 1 have not troubled ) • Government with my opinion on this question, unless when it was especially called for by the viceroy. But I think that His Vide Government Telegram of 5th August 1868, Excellency,the and my reply of 6th idem.. Governor in , • i Oouncil would probably wish to have his attention attracted to the present allusion to Angaum. 9.. • The Persian foreign Minister asserts I gave no information of my intended movements on the Arab Coast. I submit that I am in no way accountable to Persian authority in respect to ray duties in Arabia. As a matter of fact, however, I did, in an unofficial manner and in the course of friendly conversation, inform the Prince Governor General of Pars of the Government intention to punish the Bahrein Chief. At the same time, I should not wish this unofficial circumstance to be adduced, as some inconvenience might thence, perhaps, result to His Royal Highness. 10. Government will recollect that just before proceeding to l Bahrein, the danger to the Persian Coast, from the inflamed state Vide my telegram of 19th August 1868. of the Arab Coast,was so imminent, that I tele- gramed to : r.Alison on the subject, and sent copy of my telegram to India. 1 entertained little doubt that, had it not been for the recent6. recent check glyen to the Arabs, a descent on the Persian ports Vide paragraph 6 of my letter Ifc.lll, would have, ere now, dated 25th September 1868. had taken place. 11. On the whole, Government will probably deem fit;- . lstly *' ,1,0 adnere 'to their fixed policy of declining-■ to allow,or -even to discuss, Persia's pretensions to sovereignty over Bahrein or Ommanj and 2ndly.- Government will, perhaps, concur with me in considering that, under all the circumstances of the case, a letter of thanks for maritime protection would have been at once more reasonable and appropriate than is the present protest on the part of the Persian Minister for jj'Oreign Affairs. .

The Government of Fars and its Foreign Agent have learnt that, notwithstanding your perfect knowledge of treaty stipulations oetweeu the Government of Great Britain and Persia, and the rights of the Persian Government in the Gulf of Persia and in the Persian Ports and islands situated in that Gulf., and particularly in regard to its right to the island of Bahrein, which island ia absolutely the proper 0ty of the Persian Government, which right is no^ only established oy the 'treaty between the two exalted states, but in addition tnereto there are sundry other manifest and strong proofs in favour of the ^ right of the Persian Government to the ownership of the island in question, these proofs are forthcoming, and are,perhaps, m a great measure known by you, and that, although it was not right^for yoji on any consideration whatever (without the orders of the Far^ Government^ or its Foreign Agency, and without any intimation of your intentions or the necessary notices in regard to the rights of tne saojects ox the Persian Government and the treaty stipulations, seeing that p^r feet friendship and amity existed between the exalted Governments), you have absolutely and independently with tne help of ships of war reaaired unexpectedly to the island of^Bahrein, which island,with its forts and seat of Government, is the centre of (.displays) tne flag of the Lion and Sun, the emblem of the exalted Persian Govern ment, and attacked those places with cannon shot, and destroyed and razed them to the ground; also have burned two Buteels and large '-.lushwa belonging to the sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa, the Governor of| .that place, and a subject of the Persian Government, and transferred to sheikh All bin Khuleefa, the brother of sheikh Mahomed,tne Gover- \ - nor of the place, after exacting a fine from him of ten thousand— It tomans. Such absolute and independent proceedings on your part are in opposition to treaty stipulations, and contrary to the manifest and proved rights- of the Persian Government in regard to the ownership of the aforenamed island and the people thereof, especially in reference to the rights of the Sheikh Mahomed bin Khuleefa himself, and will, on 1 no account, b© consonance with the wishes of the Persian Government, i I cannot, therefore, hut strongly and in due form protest against such proceedings, and plainly to express the non-consent of my Government thereto.

The British Government readily admit that the Government of the ' Shah has protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British authorites, and they^ have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are undoubtedly aware,that the shei^cns of Bahrein have, at different periods,entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you that the British I Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for tne purposes of preventing piracy and slave trade and of maintaining the Police of the Gulf, if the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf fer ^hese purposes,this country would he relieved of a troublesome and costly duty, but if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties,Her Majesty's Government cannot suppose His Ma jesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be en couraged by impunity.5?'*° * I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings enter Gained bv Her Majesty's Government towards Persia&gt; and their desire on all I occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shahj; and m regard to this question I have the honor to state to you that.wnenever it is practicable to do so, tier Majesty's Government will cause the Persian Government to 'be informed beforehand -of any measures 01 coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh ox Bahrein maj have rendered necessary. But the British Government cannot consent to debar its officers, to whom the superintendence of the police ox tne Persian Gulf is entrusted, from the exercise of the rignt oi punisn- ing, by prompt measures, the Sheikh of Bahrein, on occasions when a reference to the Court of Teheran would be attended with embarrassing delays,which might endanger the general peace of the Gulf, but wnen- ever such a necessity shall arise a full ■communication respecting it shall be made to the Persian Government.19/109 * Qi&gt; (Jt\ Telegrajn P.

I HAVE the honour to state that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently addressed a note to His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, of which the following is a translation :— '1. According to information received by the Persian Government, a treaty was concluded between His Britannic Majesty and Ibn Saud and signed at Jeddah on the 20th May last, of which article 6 is as follows :—■ His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Kuwait and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government.' ' 2. The sovereignty of Persia over the Island of Bahrain being well founded, the Imperial Persian Government, at the time a special treaty was concluded between the British Government and the Sheikh of Bahrain, right fully protested, and Lord Clarendon, in a letter dated the 29th April, 1869, addressed to the then Persian Minister in London, formally acknowledged the justice of that protest. ' 3. You will realise that the insertion of article 6 in the above-mentioned treaty, in so far as it relates to Bahrain, is averse to the territorial integrity of Persia, and, consequently, incompatible with the friendly relations subsisting between two neighbouring countries. '4. I therefore earnestly protest against the insertion of the above article in the treaty, and shall look forward to suitable measures being taken, as soon as practicable, by His Britannic Majesty's' Government, with a view to its elimination. ' 5. I have to add further that, Persia being a member of the League of Nations, the Imperial Persian Government, conformably to article 10 of the Covenant, which guarantees the territorial integrity of its members, have forwarded a copy of their note to the League of Nations, with the request that their protest may receive due consideration.'

' f*- I duly referred to my Govern ment your note of the November.containing a formal protest against the terms of Article 6 of the treaty of Jedda concluded on the 20th ay 1927 between Mia Britannic ajesty and His ajesty the King of the Hejaz and of isejd and its Dependencies, on the ground that the reference in that article to the Islands of Bahrein is contrary to the territorial integrity of Persia. In reply I am instructed to inform Your Excellency that His ajesty's Government are not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over these islands is or can be based. Geographically the islands are not a part of Persiq, nor are the inhabitants of Persian race. His Majesty's Government therefore presume that the Persian Government can only refer to the fact that during certain periods previous to the year 1783 Bahrein was overrun and occupied by Persian troops or by the followers of certain chiefs from the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf; but it is clearly impossible to attach serious importance to a claim founded on such remote historical events. TheSi The Persian Government are under a complete misapprehension if they suppose that His Majesty's Government, either in 1869 or at any other time, intended to recognise that Bahrein was a part ofPersia. On the contrary, they have consistently endeavoured to secure that the peaceful development of the islands and the welfare of the Arab inhabitants shall not be disturbed by i unjustified attempts on the part of their neighbours to subject them to a foreign domination.

Sir, I have the honour to state with referenee to my f telegram Ko. 124, dated 8th February 1928, that in my despat«h Ko. 294-3, dated let September 1927, on the subjeet of our position at Bahrain and the 'crsian tlaims I have not referred to two events mentioned by Lorimer in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Vol. I, 'art I, page 935. • (i) ;r he fact that in 1899 apparently we informed the French Minister at Tehran of the fact that the Shaikh of Bahrain was precluded by treaty with us from holding direct relations with any foreign ower. ' (il) The unauthorised visit by a Belgians customs official to Bahrain in 1901 in the 'ersian gunboat '' &gt; ersepolis ,, » This official, onsieur Simais, whom I remember as a foreign adventurer of the type that used to arrive in Persia in bygone days and who usually drifted into the Customs or some other department until he was finally dismissed, went to Bahrain to demand the right to seal commercial vessels proceeding to 'ersian ports. He visited the Shaikh saying that he was acting under the orders of the Shah and requested him to allow the .osting of ''ersian officials at Bahrain. In; V 2 In x'eadiiif; oi this episode it appeared only to related to the unauthorised indiscretion of a Belgian 02 ficial and at the time I did not consider it worth follow -ing up in regard to 'ersian claims. In a recent issue of the Habl ul Matin, the at Persian paper published in Calcutta, which has a long and inaccuat# article; on Persian claiiis to Bahrain - a trans- -lation of which I for' ard separately - the claira is made that the ' ^ersepolis' made a voyage to Bahrain in oonnect- -ion with the punishment of some irabs there. 'his statement msxx*naturally I knew to be in- •correct and I accordingly looked up the old file relalin, to the miter, with the result already shown* ^ - I v;as however aatonished to find that in our /Sl proteat^rerarumj:; this incident not only did ^ Oategorioalljr and with considerable firmness our position, regarding Bahrain in the following words w Uo intimation was given of this ex si an mission to an irab State under -British Tot* -ection and bound by special treaties, of which the ersian Government cannot be ignorant, to the Govern- -raent of India...*..,,., it is my dutjr to place on record in the clearest manner that H.M. the Kmperor of India cannot acquiesce in any foreign interference in the affairs of Bahrain, or in those of any of the J racial Chiefs on the rab Coast of the 'ersian Gulf, and that any attempt to disturb the relations estab- -lished by treaties of long standing between these Chiefs and the Government of India will be regarded by the latter as an unfriendly act. I have endea- -voured ever since I have been here to maintain the iost cordial friendship between ray Government and that of H.M. the Shah, and I have a right to expect that if negotiationsfef 3 negotiations are entered into between ersia k * and Bahrain due regard should be had to the special re- -lations between that State and the Empire of India and that any communication which the ersian Covern- -aent wish to raake to the Bhaikh should be conveyed through H.B.M. Legation at 'ehran. 'I await the explanations which I feel sure Your Highness, who I believe cannot have authorised the extraordinary proceedings of M. Sinai*, will be good enough t© offer with regard to this regrettable incident. N but that the Grand Wazir in replying not only did not deny our claim but stated that Iff. airaais had acted without the instructions of the 'ersian Govemraent and would be re- -primanded for his action 'his coiaiaunication and the reply received remove the value in argument of any weakness shown in lord Claren -don's corMunication of 1869 or in our failure t© reply to the .-hah f s verbal request in 1886 and give a valuable base to our reply to the Grand Wazir in 1905. It may be worth while looking up the papers of the point mentioned at (i) to see if the reply we gave to the (trench Minister in 1899 was in any way coiaiaunicated to the 'ersian Government.

As you will see, it is at this stage purely provisional, and the line taken in it may have to be altered considerably in the light of consideration of the Viceroy's telegram of 18th December 2590-S and of the Colonial Office letter of 19th December, of which I send a copy by this mail, on the question of a Protectorate. But you may care to see the direction in which our minds have been working. I also enclose copy of a d.o. from Shuckburgh, in reply to Oliphant's letter of 3rd December on Bahrein. Yours sincerely. 3d. L.D. wakely. / D. de 3. Bray, K.C.I.l., C.S.I.,O.B.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.s7cJ &gt; n India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I. 22nd December 1927. Dear Baxter, 1. The position as regards Bahrein has now been rather changed by the Government of India's telegram of 18th •December of which we have sent you a copy, and the Colonial Office letter of 19th December 49025/27, both of which raise the question of regularising our position by securing an engagement from the Sheikhs or concluding a Treaty of Protection with them. We are separately considering this and will let you know our views as soon as possible: clearly I if the final decision is in favour of a Treaty of Protection or the like, the Kote to the Persian Minister would need modification. lor the moment I return your redraft. After discussion with Wakely, I venture to offer the following suggestions for incorporation in it should the decision on^ ^ the question of a Treaty of Protection be adverse, and should we in consequence be able to address the Persians on the lines originally contemplated. 2. Paragraph 2 . It is perhaps worth while to make the point that the ruling Sheikh is the lineal descendant of the Arabs who conquered Bahrein in 1783 (cp. the genealogical table in Lorimer (Vol. I, part III)). 3. Paragraph 4(a ) We discussed the other day the omission of 'the' in the first line: but after further consideration I think that this might stand in view of the wording of what follows. (b) I suggest, on the draft, certain verbal amendments in lines 4-5, and 9 of page 2. (c) Line 14 of page 2. we feel uneasily that the ; Persians had, in fact, some 'reason to infer' from the terms of the Note of 29th April 1869 that we recognised their sovereignty over Bahrein: and, as it is in any case, in our view desirable to be quite definite on the point, we suggest ojn.£i u di-i| qo J i * that 'has no reason to infer' might fee replaced fey 'is under a complete misunderstanding in inferring'. (d) Page 3, line 19, - Page 4, line 19. This is the one point of sufestance on which we feel serious misgivings. We agree that reference to the terms of our lote of April 1869 is inevitafele, feut the draft as it stands seems likely to leave an impression unduly favourafele to Persia. On closer examination of the Hote of 1869 it seems to us possifele to separate the (at first sight) emfearrassing statements in its third and fourth paragraphs from the question of the status of the Sheikh; and we suggest therefore for consideration the substitution for the passage on page 3» line 19 to page 4, line 19 of your redraft of the following;-- 'That Note stated that Her Majesty's Government had given due consideration to the protest of the Persian Government against 'the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored fey the British authorities', but it in no way admitted any such right. On the contrary, the whole tenour of the Note went to make it clear that Her Majesty's Government maintained their right to enter into direct treaty relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein (as independent rulers); and while at the same time it indicated that Her Majesty's Government would gladly transfer to Persia, if she were able and willing to perform them, certain duties in the Persian Gulf towards the performance of which the Treaty relations in question contributed, and offered, in view of the friendly feelings entertained fey Her Majesty's Government towards Persia, to cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand, when practicafele of any measures of coercion which the conduct of the Sheikh might have rendered necessary, it is evident that no recognition of the validity of the Persian protest, or of the Persian claim to suzerainty, was thereby intended or implied. The Note, in fact, as the Persian Legation . . . . ' The© \ g/ Tlie aoceptanoe of this would involve the alterations shown in pencil in lines 1, 2 and perhaps 3 of page 5 of the draft. 4. Page 6. Last 4 lines - 7 amend as shown in pencil on the draft. 5. Page 7, lines 6-8. We feel that some more definite repudiation of the Bruce Agreement is desirable that 'cannot he regarded as binding'. He suggest 'regarded as ever having possessed any binding force'. We suggest further, for consideration, that it might be desirable to strengthen the whole sentence by the addition after the words 'agreement' of some such phrase as 'having regard to international law and custom' (cp. in this connection Sir G. Spring Rice's Bote to Persia of 13th August 1907 - Tehran Despatch 179 of 15th August 1907)» 6. The above represents our departmental comment on the ■ - ' ' '■ ' ■ ' lotes but in view of its importance and the interest of India in the question at issue, we should be glad to be consulted officially after it has been examined in the Foreign Ofx'ice, before a reply goes to the x-'ersian Itinister. Yours sincerely, Sd. J.G. Laithwaite.

Hovannes Khan Sir, Mossaed, Persian Minister. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your lote Ko.910/306 of the 26th Hovember, containing the formal protest of your Government against the terms of Article 6 of the Treaty of Jeddah, concluded on the 20th May 1927, 'between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and lejd and its dependencies, on the ground that the reference in that Article to the Islands of Bahrein is contrary to the territorial integrity of Persia. i HB 2. In reply I must request you to inform your Government that His Majesty's Government are not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty- over these islands is or can 'be based. Geo graphically the islands are not a part of Persia, nor are the inhabitants of Persian race. His Majesty's Government are aware that during part of the 17th century and for some years during the latter part of the 18th century Bahrein was t Tri £b v was overrun and occupied by Persian troops, or by the followers of certain Chiefs from the Eastern shores of the Persian Gulf; but it appears to be established that in or about the year 1783 the Government of the Shah were dis possessed of the islands by an invasion of Arab ? insert i- 'under the leader ship of the direct lineal ancestor of the present Sheikh tribes,/ and that since that date the islands have never at any time been under the effective control of Persia. OsCeasctHs 3. The Persian Government have on various/ /» alleged that their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein has been, recognised by His Majesty's Government. While it is not evident that, even if this assertion were justified, it would confer on Persia the right of ownership ihich on other grounds appear^so difficult to esta blish, His Majesty's Government feel that they must once and for all declare this statement to be entirely inadmissible. 4. The special treaty relations between His Majesty's Government and the successive Sheikhs ? substitute for words in brackets the first in the series of under takings by which those relations are regulated of Bahrein, to which reference is made in the Treaty of Jeddah, have now been in existence (- J ifst-o£-1kes«-ag^ee»Ba4s) for more than a century, (undertakings)/ havingHttS. ? substitute for the words in bracket;- the claim to in dependence of the Sheikh. ? substitute for the ?/ords in brackets?- is under a complete misunderstanding in Aif erring *1 having been signed in the year 1820. The agree ments have throughout been concluded on the basis that the Sheikh of Bahrein is an independent Ruler. His Majesty's Government do not deny that /(this elaim) is one which has from time to time been contested by the Government of the Shah, and in particular in the discussions which took place in 1869, to which reference is made in your Hote. They desire, however, to point out that your Government (has no reason to infer)/ from the terms of the communication made by Lord Clarendon to the Persian Minister on the 29th April 1869, that any recogni^.'^ ? substitute for words JLn brackets the redraft Suggested in 3(d) of the accompanying demi- official letter. of the validity of the Persian claims to sovereignty . in Bahrein was at that time intended. (That Uote stated that the British Government readily admitted 'that the Government of the Shah has protested 'against the Persian right of sovereignty over/ 'Bahrein being ignored by the British Authorities, 'and they have given due consideration to that 'protest', and proceeded, as a mere matter of courtesy to the Persian Government, to assure them that their sole purpose in holding the Sheikh of ill Bahrein to his engagements was that of preventing: piracy and the slave trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf, and they would therefore,therefore, in view of the friendly feelings entertained 'by them towards Persia, and their if dSsire on all occasions to meet as far as possiHe the wishes of the Shah, cause the Persian Govern ment to he informed beforehand, so far as was practicahle, of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct'of the Sheikh of Bahrein might have rendered necessary. l?o recog nition of the validity of the Persian protest was therefore intended or implied; and) as the ? omit words in brackets ? insert pencil amendment shown. Persian Legation at Constantinople were reminded P in December 1871 by Sir Henry Elliott then/ British Ambassador in Turkey, {Lord Clarendon's ITote) contains nothing more than an acknowledg-r ment that the Persian claim to suzerainty had previously been made,. The numerous supplementary^ agreements entered into between the British I Government and the Rulers of Bahrein between 1869 and the present day have equally proceeded on the assumption that no claim to sovereignty in Bahrein on the part either of the Government of the Shah or of the Turkish Government could ' t possibly be admitted by His Majesty's Govern ment. 5. Thei ^ Sb 5. The attitude of His Majesty's Government towards this question vsas still more clearly defined when in the year 1906, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, on their instructions, addressed to the Persian Governmsnt a note stating that 'His Majesty's Government have 'never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of 'Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim is in 'their view, entirely inadmissible. His %jestyfe' 'Government consider the island of Bahrein and 'its inhabitants to be under British protection, 1 I 'and must decline to entertain any further re presentations on the subject'. The Mote added that this reply had invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, which had on several occasicn advanced a claim to Bahrein. In reply to this Uote a forinal protest was received from the Persian Government, in which their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein was based on an agree ment dated the 20th August 1822, between Captain William Bruce, 'the special Commissioner of the British Government', and the Prince Governor of Shiraz. This agreement, however, as was pointed out in a reply from His %jesty's Minister dated the 3rd January, 1907, and again on the I 3^ s L^-23rd February 1907, was promptly disavowed at ' insert 'having regard to inter national law and custom' ? substitute for M 'binding ,, 'ever having possessed any ^ binding force' the time, as having been entered into without authority, by the proper representatives of His Britannic Majesty, and His Majesty the Shah also refused to recognise its stipulations and ex pressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructioni. In these circumstances the agree ment/ clearly cannot be regarded as (binding) From the foregoing remarks Your .ixcellency will observe that the Persian Government are | ■ under a complete misapprehension if they suppose . that His Majesty's Government either in 1869 or I at any other time, intended to recognise that Bahrein was a part of Persia, and that, while they have indeed admitted that a claim on the subject has from time to time been put forward by the Persian Government, they have never admitted the validity of the claims which either the Turkish or Persian Governments have fre quently put forward in the past. Their con sistent endeavour in the matter of Bahrein has been to secure that the peaceful development of thethe islands and the welfare of the Arah inhabi tants shall not be disturbed, by unjustified attempts on the part of their neighbours to subject them to a foreign domination. They are not now prepared to -contemplate any departure from this policy. 7, A copy of this Hote has been send to the SecretaryGeneral of the League of Nations.Downing Street, 19th December 1927.

SECRET. 28th December 1927, Sir, I arn coraraanded by the Air Council to refer Colonial Office letter of the 19th December 1927, No. 49025/27 requesting the views of the Air Council upon Colonel Haworth's suggestion, put forward in his despatches Nos. 2942-S and 29^3 of the 1st September 1927, that His Majesty's Government should regularise their position in Bahrein by means of a Treaty of Protection. 2. From the point of view of British air interests, Bahrein is of great potential importance and the Air Council would strong ly desire to see our position there consolidated, either by tne means suggested by Colonel Haworth or by any other course which may be considered politically feasible. Bahrein is an importano link in a route betv/een Basra and Karachi, and its isolation from the mainland and the long continued presence of a British political officer on the island, should make Bahrein less likely to be disturbed by anti-British movements than might other places on the Arabian coast. ■ 3, ■ The reasons which impel the Air Council to favour a Treaty of Protection or other similar measure aret- (a) The difficulty which is being experienced in obtaining permission for j/fjying facilities from the Persian Government and the consequent desirability of finding and alternative route. It is, however, at leasu Dossible that when the Persian Government realise that and alternative route is being made available their own attitude will change. (b) As regards use for military purposes, the Southern route would be less likely to interference or to the imx)osition of arbitrary conditions than would tne route over Persian territory. (c) 1(w) (c) In the, it is to be hoped, unlikely event of warlike operations in the Persian Gulf or against the Hedjaz, the use of Bahrein as an aeroplane or seaplane 'base would 'be of first importance. (d) Its value as an antidote to Ibn Saud's expanding influence and the evidence which it would afford to the trucial Chiefs that H.M. Government is not without the means of maintaining its prestice in the Persian Gulf. The Air Council infer from Sir Robert Olive's telegram No, 223 of November 24tji that a statement of policy in the matter is of some urgency. I am, etc,, (Sd) H. McAnally.

M' ri Sir, I ara directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No, 49025/27 of December 19th regarding the administration of the islands of Bahrein. 2, The Secretary of State has given his attention to the suggestion made by Colonel Hav.otth in his despatch No, 295-S of September 1st, 1927, to the Government of India (of which a copy was enclosed in your letter No. 49025/27 of November 16th) to the effect that His Majesty's Government should take an early opportunity of regularizing their position in Bahrein by concluding a Treaty of Protection with the present Sheikh. Before expressing a definite opinion on this matter, however, he would prefer to await the considered views of the Government of India. J 3» At the same time, as Mr, Secretary Amery will have observed from the Viceroy's telegram No. 2590/S of December ISth | to the Secretary of State for India, a suggestion for the im mediate (though partial) regularization of the position of His Majesty's Government was recently put forward by His Majesty's Resident in the Persian Gulf, Colonel Haworth, in fact, proposes to obtain from the present Sheikh a document, countersigned by Sheikh Tza, authorising His Majesty's Govern ment to defend the independence,of Bahrein against Persia at Geneva, and if possible stating the dependence of the Sheikhdom on the protection of His Majesty's Government. 4. With this proposal Sir Austen Chamberlain is in entire concurrence, subject only to the proviso that no sort of pressure be brought to bear on the Sheikhs in order to induce them to sign the document.

Hovhannee Khan Mossaed, Persian Minister, ^7 Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note Bo. 910/306 of the 26th November,containing the formal protest which the Persian Government have seen fit to make agai&amp;st the terms of Article 6 of the Treaty of Jeddah, concluded on the 20th May 1927, between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and Nejd and its dependencies, on the ground that the reference in that Article to the Islands of Bahrein is contrary to the territorial integrity of Persia * 2, In reply I shall be grateful if you will inforiji your government that His Majesty*s Government are not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over these islands is or can be based. Geographically the islands are not a part of Persia, nor are the inhabitants of Persian race. His Majesty's Government are aware that during part of the seventeenth century and for some years during the latter part of the eighteenth century Bahrein was overrun and occupied by Persian troops, or by the followers of certain Chiefs from the Eastern shores of the Persian Gulf; but it appears to be established that in or about the year 1783 the Government of the Shah were dispossessed of the islands by an invasion of Arab tribes under the leader ship of the direct lineal ancestor of the present Sheikh and that since that date the islands have never at any time been under the effective control of Persia. 3. The Persian Government have on various occasions alleged that their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein has been recognised by His Majesty's Government, While is it not evident that, even if this assertion werel-j were justified, it would confe on Persia the right of ownership which on other grounds appears so difficult to establish, His Majesty's Government feel that they must once and for all declare this statement to 'be entirely inadmissible. The special treaty relations*between His Majesty's Government and the successive Sheikhs of Bahrein, to which reference is made in the Treaty of Jeddah have now oeen in existence for more than a century the first in the series of undertakings by which those relations are regulated having been signed in the year 1820. The agree ments have throughout been concluded on the jfasis that the Sheikh of Bahrein is an independent Ruler. His Majesty's Government do not deny that the claim to independence of the Siieikh is one which has from time to time been i contested by the Government of the Shall, and in particular in the discussions which took place in 1869, to which reference is made in your note, I desire, however, to point out that your government are under a complete mms- linaerstanding in inferring from the terms of the cominunica tion ijiade by the late Earl of Clarendon to the Persian .iviinister on the 29th April, 1869, that any recognition of the validity ol the Persian claims to sovereignty in Bahrein was at that time intended. In that note it was stated that Her Majesty's Government had given due considers tlon to the protest of the Persian Government 'against the 'Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British authorities', but it in no way admitted any such right. On the contrary the whole tenor of the note should have made it clear that Her Majesty's Government maintained their right to enter into direct treaty relations with tne Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent ;rulers; and while at the same time it indicated that Her Majesty's Government would gladly transfer to Persia, if she were able and willing to perform them, certain duties in the PersianPersian Gulf towards the performance of which the Treaty relations in question contributed, and offered, in view of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty's Government towards Persia, to cause the Pexsian Govexnment to oe informed beforehand, when practicable, of any measure of coercion which the conduct of the Sheikhs might have rendered necessary, it is evident that no recognition of the validity of the Persian protest, or of the Persian claim to suzerainty, was thereby intended or implied. The Note, in fact, as the Persian Legation at Constantinople was reminded in December 1871 by Sir Henry Elliot, then Her Majesty's Ambassador in Turkey, contains nothing more than an acknowledgement that the Persian claim to suzerainty had previously been made. The numerous supplementary agreements entered into between the British Government and the Rulers of Bahrein betv/een 1869 and the present day have equally proceeded on the assumption that a claim to sovereignty in Bahrein on the part either of the Government of the Shah or of the Turkish Government could not possibly be admitted by His Majesty's Government. 5. The attitude of His Majesty's Government towards this question v/as still more clearly defined when in the year 1906 His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, on my predecessor's instructions, addressed to the Persian Government a note stating that 'His Majesty's Government, have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim is, in their view, entirely inadmissible. His Majesty's Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject'. The Hote added that this reply had invariably been made to the Ottoman Government which had on several occasions advanced a claim, to Bahrein. InIn reply to this Note a forms.l protest was received from the Persian Government, in which their claim to sover eignty over Bahrein was 'based on an agreement dated the 30th August, 1822, between Captain William Bruce, 'The Special Commissioner of the British Government', and the Prince Governor of Shiraz. This agreement however, as was pointed out in a reply from His Majesty's Minister on the 3rd January 1907, and again on the 23rd February 1907, was promptly disavowed at the time by the proper representatives of His Britannic Majesty, as having been entered into without authority, and His Majesty Path Ali Shah also refused to recognise its stipulations and expressed his displeasure that the Prin^ of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions. In these circumstances, having regard to international law and custom, the agreement cannot be regarded as ever having possessed any binding force. 6, Prom the foregoing remarks you will observe that the Persian Government are not justified in supposing that His Majesty's Government, either in 1869 or at any other time, intended to recognise that Bahrein was a part of Persia, and that, while they have indeed admitted that a claim on the subject has from time to time been put forward by the Persian Government they have never admitted the validity of the claims which either the Turkish or Persian Governments have frequently put forward in the past. Their consistent endeavour in the matter of Bahrein has been, to secure that the peaceful development of the islands and the welfare of the Arab inhabitants shall not be disturbed by unjustified attempts on the part of their neighbours to subject them to a foreign domination. They are not prepared to contemplate any departure from this policy, 7, A copy of this Note has been sent to the Secretary- General of the League of Nations,I r ic^ L C. . P/5/28. INDIA OFFICE.

The Arabs mention ed that Bahrein had equally been claimed by the Turks who described it as 'Mahrus'. One man mentioned that perhaps the Portuguese will but in a claim.

Section l [E 220/51/91] No. 1. Sir Austen Chamberlain to Hovhann Sir, Office, anuary 18, 1928. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your nofe of the 26th November, containing the formal protest which the Persian Government have seen fit to make against the terms of article 6 of the Treaty of Jeddah, concluded on the 20th May, 1927, between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and Nejd and its dependencies, on the ground that the reference in that article to the Islands of Bahrein is contrary to the territorial integrity of Persia. 2. In reply, I shall be grateful if you will inform your Government that His Majesty's Government are not aware of any valid grounds upon which the claim of the Persian Government to sovereignty over these islands is or can be based. Geographically, the islands are not a part of Persia, nor are the inhabitants of Persian race. His Majesty's Government are aware that during part of the 17th century and for some years during the latter part of the 18th century Bahrein was overrun and occupied by Persian troops, or by the followers of certain chiefs from the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf; but it appears to be established that in or about the year 1783 the Government of the Shah were dispossessed of the islands by an invasion of Arab tribes under the leadership of the direct lineal ancestor of the present sheikh, and that since that date the islands have never at any time been under the effective control of Persia. 3. The Persian Government have on various occasions alleged that their claim to sovereignty over Bahrein has been recognised by His Majesty's Government. While it is not evident that, even if this assertion were justified, it would confer on Persia the right of ownership which on other grounds appears so difficult to establish, His Majesty's Government feel that they must once and for all declare this statement to be entirely inadmissible. 4. The special treaty relations between His Majesty's Government and the successive Sheikhs of Bahrein, to which reference is made in the Treaty of Jeddah, have now been in existence for more than a century, the first in the series of under takings by which those relations are regulated having been signed in the year 1820. The agreements have throughout been concluded on the basis that the Sheikh of Bahrein is an independent ruler. His Majesty's Government do not deny that the claim to independence of the sheikh is one which has from time to time been contested by the Government of the Shah, and in particular in the discussions which took place in 1869, to which reference is made in your note. I desire, however, to point out that your Government are under a complete misunderstanding in inferring from the terms of the communication made by the late Earl of Clarendon to the Persian Minister on the 29th April, 1869, that any recognition of the validity of the Persian claims to sovereignty in Bahrein was at that time intended.

II.— Translation of the letter addressed Excellency Sir Robert Henry Clive According to the Persian Government's information, Article 6 of the Treaty signed at Jeddah, on May 20th, 1927, between Sultan Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud and the British Government, is in the following terms :— ' His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependen cies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Kuwait and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty rela tions with His Britannic Majesty's Government As Bahrein is incontestably an Persian possession, and as upon the con clusion of the special agreement between the British Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein the Persian Government rightly protested against that agreement, and Lord Clarendon, in his reply to the Persian Minister in London dated April 29th, 1869, officially recognised the justice of that protest. Your Excellency will agree that the above-mentioned article, so far as it concerns Bahrein, constitutes an infringement of the territorial integrity of Persia and is incompatible with the good relations which have always existed between the two friendly neighbour States.

With repprd to the suggested action to regularise the British position, % Lords concur with the opinion ex ressed by the Government of India in their telegram of 29th December, 1927, that the appeal of Persia to the League of nations has made it extremely undesirable to take any action whilst the matter may be considered sub-judice, except the seeking of a Power of Attorney to represent the case for the independence of Bahrein before the League. 3.

I have, &amp;c. L. HAWORTH. Enclosure in (2). tvC'/lS~S, Lieutenant-Colonel Haworth (Confidential.) Sir, to be used m our refutation of the Persian claim'to Bahrein, I have the h^oufto3 state that it would appear that any weakness which, as far as the position of Great Britain is concerned, may lie in the statement of Lord Clarendon in 1869, would be met by the admission of the fact that at that date we made no special claim to the 'protection of Bahrein. Indeed, in the treaty of 1861, we refer to the independent ruler of Bahrein. In 1869 we were, like Persia, interested in the safety of the Persian Gulf for commerce, and would gladly have accepted Persian co-operation in maintaining order had her naval position admitted of it. Our special position arose out of our continued policing of the Persian Gulf against piracy and our general assistance to Bahrein which culminated in our treaty with the sheikh in 1880, from which year may be said to date the suggestion of ' protection,' since we accepted the control of his foreign relations. The 1892 treaty was an extension of that of 1880. This explains our position vis-a-vis Persia, but does not touch the position of Bahrein vis-a-vis Persia, which is not affected by any statement we may or may not have made prior to our acceptance of the control of her foreign relations in 1880. But we have, since 1822, when we disavowed to the Government of Pars the action of Captain Bruce, informed the Persian Government of our belief in the independence of Bahrein from Persian control. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, London, and His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. I have, &amp;c. L. HAWOETH.o v r S) GONTIDENTIAL .

Lord Birkenhead directs me, however, to take this opportunity to suggest that, if consideration has not already been given to the precedent set in 1897 in the case of the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf, Sir Austen Chamberlain might think it of some interest in the present connection since while the major objections of policy would still require examination one at any tate of the difficulties referred to in Admiralty letter of 25th January Ho.

Yours ever, GHAIIGERY. sty's Consulate-General, B U S H I R E.o G 0 F Y. British Legation, 0 • '• Tehran. vp 8th February, 1928. Sir, .iith rexerence to previous correspondence on the suTDject of the ownership of Bahrein, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith translation of an article on that question which is said, to Ise in answer to a recent article in 'The Times' 1 and. which purports to give the history of Bahrein from the earliest days. 2 ' T he 'Shafagh-i-Surkh' is in no sense even a semi- ofxicial organ, buo as all papers are sulDjecteo. to a loose Government censorship, the article in question may be said, to have received the Government's approval prior to publication, although such approval does not amount to inspiration. 2. Other papers have made references to the ownership of Bahrein, but none of them has attempted to write its history in the same retailed manner. 4. A Majlis Deputy, at the instigation, I am told, of a member of the present Government, made a remark in open session last week to the effect that the Persian Government should send a G-overnor to Bahrein and that Bahrein should send ;ht Honourable ■Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., U.P., ^fOREIGH OFFICE.-2- Ml If send, a Deputy to the Majlis. The remark, however, was J i passed over without any comment from the deputies present. Copies of this despatch are 'being sent to the Government of India and to His Majesty's High Commissioner [i for 'Iraq, Baghdad. I have the honour to 'be with the highest respect, I Sir, Your most obedient, humh1e S e rvant, (Signed) R.H.Glive. tlinelosure in Tehran Despatch !To. 79 dated 8th February, 192.8 extract from the ''Shafa^h-l-Surkh'' dated S9th January. 1928. Under the title of r, The illogical whispers about Bahrein' this paper says:- The newspapers of London, ica/itated also by the Iraq, Press, have recently begun to publish unfounded and illogical talks about Bahrein and we find it necessary to answer them and to let the public become aware of the iaols. =je therefore puDlish nerewith one of the articles published recently by the Weekly Times of London together with the commehfe of one of the nas^eriui ana. inixiateu ^ersian writers who has sent; his article to be published in our paper. (Here the translation of the article of The Times is reproduced). ^ I have not sufficient information in this connection from the time of the Acheminians, Asaknians, and ?Sel t juks? but from the time of the Sasanians to this date when the history of all parts of Persia is clearer than the Sun Bahrein has always been an inseparable part of Persia. Even in the time of Mohammed, the Prophet, who despatched Ala Hafri to Bahrein to invite the inhabitants to believe in the Mohammedan faith, Munzar ibn Savi was appointed by Akasareh dynasty as the Governor of the Arabs, and, Somokht, the Persian, was the Governor of that province, both of whom were converted to Islam. Some of the Christian and Zoroastrian inhabitants who refused to be converted agreed to pay a fine. The Second Caliphat, after the invasion of Persia, followed up the policy of His Holiness the Prophet and treated the Zoroaatrians of Persia like those of Bahrein. In the time of the supremacy of the Arabs Bahrein like all parts of Persia, was under Arab rule. As soon as, however, Persia became independent, the Persians turned their attention to that part of their c ountryI ■ o Hurmuz and was under the oeoupation of Touran Shah-itm-Songhor Shajur'' In the 910 or S13 Hijra, that Songhor the Second son of ^ o Touran Shah, asaended the throne the Prtugese raided and occupied Hurmuz and subsequently they occupied Bahrein too. The local governor however was maintained and Rolcneddin Masoud, the brother of Sharafeddin Lutfulla, the minister of Hurmuz was the Governor. Disliking the aggression and intervention of the Portugese he asked for help from Khajeh Moineddin Fali/kho was his relative. Khajeh informed Alia Yerdi Khan, who was the Governor of Fars under Shah Abbas Safavi and in accordance with his (Allah Verdi's) order Khajeh formed an army composed of the warriors of Fal and Asir and recovered Bahrein from the Portugese. From that date up to the end of the Safavieh dynasty Bahrein was directly under Shiraz. At the end of the Jafavieh dynasty when the affairs of Persia again fell into chaos wouxxti^ iBahreinj and occupied it as history shows in the time oi ohe jubt ...ing, Azed-ed-Dowleh, of Pailam, who was of pure Persian race, and who used to rule the island. After the extinction of the Dailami dynasty and in the time of feudality, Bahrein was still subordinate to the southern ports. For instance in the time of Bani Kaisar, the island of Kais was their ik capital and they had supremacy over Laristan and the major part of tne islands and ports ol the Persian Gulf, Bahrein included. Atabak—Abou—Bakr—ibn—Saad-Zanki, the Ing of Fars after having B occupied, in the year 626, the island Kais and annihilated the Government of Bani Kaisar captured, in the year 633 Bahrein, Katif and Ihsa, and daring the whole period -^tabaks of Fars and Solghors had under their own occupation the islands Bahrein, Ghatif and Ihsa. After the raid of the Moghols, in the time of Jangisian and Tamourian Bahrein was under their occupation. After the Moghols became weak and feudality prevailed again in Persia Bahrein was subordinate to the Persian ports in the Persian Gulf and for some time it was annexed to the Island of it ro fltcJ n u oliaos tlie SiieiMi of JabTsareh., Howli, who was from the Arabs of the Talieri port and a Persian subject took advantage of the opportunity and annexed Bahrein to his own jurisdiction. After n the rise of Nadir Shah, Mirza Taghi Khan, the Governor of Fars, captured Bahrein from the SheiMi of Jabbareh and annexed it to Shiraz (1150). In the year 1151 Saif-ibn-Sultan who was still (T) ^unaware of the power of Nadir Shah captured Bahrein and made a general massacre. In the 1152, however, in virtue of the orders of Nadir Shah, Mohammed Taghi Khan and Kalb Ali Khan invaded Masghat and killed Saif ibn Sultan and again the whole islands of the Persian Gulf were occupied by the Persian Government agents. Nadir Shah, in recognition of the services rendered by Sheikh Ghais and Sheikh ITasr who were governors of Bushire entrusted Bahrein to them and for a long time Bahrein was annexed to Bushire and under the rule of A1 Mazkoor, and a regiment of soldiers was always garrisoned there. In the year 119 7 which coincided with the time of the governorship of Ali llorad Khan Zand, as Persia was in an abnormal condition, the Bani Atabeh, who are the present Sheikhs, availed themselves of the opportunity and captured the island from A1 Hazkoor, they dispersed the Government troops and drove them out, but as soon i' ; ' ■ • as Persia revived the Bani Atabeh expressed their allegiance to the Persian Government and agreed to accept the same responsibil ity as A1 Mazkoor had. One of the evidences proving their allegiance to the Persian Government which I can remember is that in the time of (ty&gt;Abdolla-ibn-Ahmed who was a Contemporary of Path Ali Shah, a * u.**- u oertain Eslcandar Khan went to Bahrein detailed hy the Goirernor ^ M j N 'tl' 16 Sheikhs, in addition to the payment of the revenues vArV, General of Pars to collect revenues,and presents wrote a letter %A.' jl II i m to the Governor General of Pars who was the son Path Ali Shah fUr' 1 '' / and in the letter they precisely expressed their allegiance and ^ K*' 1. k ^ - r I ^, ^'jv^loyalty to the Persian Government. „ v i V* •* ' * Lflr those times the ships belonging to the British ^ Governmentit' -- (5&gt; ^ T pv^t^ i cvA - ^ c&gt;&lt;' (D iGrovemment used to frequent the Persian Gulf the British Govern- Iment used to acknov /ledge the sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein in the treaties which have been concluded between them and the 'ersian Government. One of the treaties was concluded in Shiraz in the time of Hassan Ali Mirza, the son of Fath Ali Shah, and the Governor of Fars. Another proof of their strong ties to Persia is that in the year 1258 when a war broke out between Abdolla-ibn- Ahmed and his nephew, llohammed-ibn-Khalifeh, although Hejd territory was much nearer to the island and the Sultan of Hejd had much power at the time and could easily support him, Abdolla with all the inhabitants of Mohragh who abandoned Bahrein, immigrated into Persia because theij^ had recognised themselves as Persian subjects and were not willing to be deprived of the protection of their own Government. Most of the inhabitants of Kais and the N Arabs of Lingah now are from the descendents of those emigrants. As Mohammed-ibn-Khalifeh took the affairs of Bahrein in his' hands and became Emir, he expressed in turn his allegiance to Persia and this caused Persia to refrain from backing up Abdolla / ibn Ahmed. Meantime the influence of the Britishers in the Persian Gulf increased and owing to apathy of the Persian Govern ment, Mohammed Ibn Khali fell who was a cautious man became embarrassed and delegated a special representative called Khali1 Merrikhi to the Court of lasser-ed-Din Shall and said that until the time when the Arab tribes were the only enemies of Bahrein .they could repulse them without charging any expenses to the |Persian Government but now that a powerful Government decided to interfere they were unable to resist and it was necessary that a detachment of troops be despatched at once to the place. The Persian Government therefore despatched immediately a detachment to the island in sailing vessels but the warships of the British Government presented them from landing. This caused open enmity of the Britishers against Sheikh Mohammed and they began to draw up plans for his annihilation. According * r' ammm5 H k According to their old policy instigating brother against brother, the Britishers instigated SheiMi Ali ibn TChalifeh against his own 'brother and in order to ensure the victory of bheiich Ali they raaae ready their warships and 'bombarded the fort oi Abi Hamer where bheiKh. .. ohsunmed used to live and the Persian flag was hoisted. The poor SheiMi was obliged to flee. After the flight of SheiMi Hohammed the Britishers concluded a treaty with Sheikh Ali and according to information gleaned by me (the writer) the Persian Government protested through its Minister in London against this treaty and the British Government in reply to the protest aclaiowledged the sovereignty of Persia over the island. In the year 1286, SheiMi Mohammed ibn Khalifeh again gathered some forces and attacked Bahrein, as a result Sheikh Ali was killed and his followers were defeated and repulsed. After a while the British war ships again under the pretence that in the fighting some of the Hindus resident in Bahrein had been killed, bombarded the city of Menameh and made captive Sheikh Mohammed who had been captured by deceit by the sons of Abdolla ibn Ahmed and deported the said Sheikh to India. Meanwhile SheiMi Issa Ali seized the occasion and with the help of the Nairn clan who were his tribe captured Bahrein. This is a brief history of Bahrein and our readers can undoubtedly gather from the above account that Bahrein has, since the time of Sasanian, been continually under Persia and one of the Persian islands except in the time of Islam when Persia had no dependencies. There are still many villages there which have kept their Persian name such as Salm Abad, Koub Abad, and Barabar and the fortifications there are still an evidence of the Persian ownership. and :rivan also once belonged to Persia; this is quite right but it should be noted that the Persian Government its rights on those lands in consequence of wars and treaties, but with Perhaps they say that Afghanistan, Kharasm, Turkistan, regard^SJ - 6 - '11 regard to Bahrein the Persian Government has conoluded no treaty V'ith a!:j -/'oody in accordanoe with which it may have made away its rights to another party. ■ It was only in the last half century that the British Government was very weak and on account of lack of Havy* specially could not pay attention to Bahrein. Does anybody lose xiis ownership ix, lor instance, owing to lack of capital and means, I10 oould not dp3.w bencf its fpom his let no. ? Ixi snort xjahrein is one of the psipts of Peps is. as 'before • Answer to The Times. -i-iie Times of London has brought all the evidence in its own favour. For instance it says that Bahrein consists of five islands and is distant from fifteen to thirty miles from ^raoia. it ui/ies go explain that as the island is nearer to the shores of Arabia its annexation to Arabia is more logical than 1 to rersia. If this is a reasonable proof we wonder why Canada should not be annexed to the United States of America as it is nearer to that country. Another proof brought by the paper is tnat the Britisners nave ueen interfering for half a century in the island; I wonder whether the paper has been ill-informed or it is ignorant in this matter; owing to the chaos ana disordered conaiuion of Persia, British agents until about six years ago were interfering in all the internal affairs of Persia in the coasts southern psxis and even financial and judicial matters used to be settled in the British Consulates at Mohammerah, Bushire, Lingah, and Bandar Abbas,. They had until very recently their own post offices in our ports; no sooner did they become suspicious of one of the chiefs or Khans of one of the ports than they at once bombarded their homes as in the year 1525 or 36 the Aslou, ITaiband, Haleh Shiou and Chirou ports were bombarded by ,t them. Another ridiculous proof brought by the paper is that it says that in the 16th century the Portugese occupied BahreinK- . | © Bahrein and in the year 1602 the Persians expelled, them from that land., in the year 1783 the Ara'bs captured. Atoob of Bahrein and in the year 1800 the Sultan of Masqat oeoupied that plaoe, aiter one year the '/ahhahies drove him out and the region remained in their hands until the year 1811 when Atoo'b again occupied the place Although this part of the article is full Oi. errors and mistakes, we do not mind because we are not bound co put right the mistakes of the paper, we only have to point out that the writer of the article has tried to conceal the fact of Persian sovereignty over the island from the time of the i&gt;aoanians to assered Din Shah and has only mentioned the expulsion of the Portugese from the islands by the Persians, / ' Another point in the article vtiich is so skilfully inserted is that the paper says that in the year 1783 the Arabs of Atoob took ^anrein from ersia. This is indeed very strangej the small clan of Atabeh who with all their followers do not exceed 500 families is shown by the paper as a rival of Persia. The paper neglects to mention the fact that such skirmishes between the trioes in Persia have always happened but it never invalidated the sovereignty of Persia, For example, A1 Moashasha, had for some time supremacy and lOiazaal was the last Sheikh of that line. There are still many places in Persia such as Baluchistan, y Luristan and the chieftainship changes from one Khan to another but they are all under the Persian Government. The most ridiculous part is that the treaty concluded secretly by the Uast India Company or the Government of India with the Sheikh of Bahrein is deemed by the paper as a proof of the Sheikh the independence of kafcaasxn and the legality of the inter ference of the Britishers. This is exactly like somebody who persuades the tenant of a house to claim to be the owner of the house and then to draw up with the tenant an agreement so that after he has succeeded in establishing his claim, the new owner may reward the man who has helped him by giving him a share of the rthe pro!it. If the British Government in the time of disturbances have concluded some treaties with the SheiMis of Kishm, iiangam, Ghais and IChassal, does this treaty deprive Persia ox' her right of sovereignty ? Is this treaty worth a cent in the present world ? Another .point to which the paper alludes is the raid of the Sultan of Iaskat on Bahrein; the paper tries to explain that if Bahrein 'belonged to Persia they would not raid it. If the writer had referred to the history of the Persian Gulf he would certainly not have made such foolish statements; customarily, in the time of disturbances in Persia, the SheiMis of Arabia have always raided the islands on the opposite side, like the Sultan of Maskat who raided Bandari Abbas, Minab, Biabai, Roudan, P.oudbar, xjingeh, Hurmuz and Ghishm. The raiders were once driven out from those places by Prince Tahmasib Mirza and an army headed by Abdol Baghi Hirza. The Sultan of Nijd likewise raided the shores of Sheebkooh in the time of Saoud ibn Abdol Aziz and eventually the inhabitants themselves annihilated them and filled the walls of the village Meryakh with their bodies. The Wahhabies who reside now on the shores of Laristan remain from that time. As regards the allegation of the paper that Sheikh Issa owing to old age abdicated and granted the rule to his son. Sheikh Ahmed, this is indeed more ridiculous. If the realities can be concealed to such an extent it should be admitted that reality has no worth in the world. The British agents who, after the great war, were proud of their victory changed their gentle policy and appointed a rough military man (Major Daily) to interfere in the internal affairs of Bahrein and to take into his own hands, the police, municipality and finances. As they tried to secure a signature from Sheikh Issa submitting to their interference and the Sheikh refused to recognise them they pressed the Sheikh hard; and as the Britishers suspected the youngero o - 9 - younger son of the SheiMa to te the one who prevented the Sheikh giving his signature they compelled him to dismiss SheiMi ^uttolla; axl the vtfise and honest people who were round the Sheikh veie albo exiled. As they obtained no result from this pressure they, (the Britishers) on the pretext of a disturbance which everybody knew by Y/hose hands it was conspired, brou^it their warships and threatened the Sheikh asking him to resign, but the oheiich i esistea and the Britishers failed. Subsequently after a few days tney published a notice in the town stating that as the Sheikh was old he was dismissed by the Britishers and his son Sheikh Ahmed was appointed in his place. They invited the inhabitants to agree with the appointment but as they all refused to do so they cancelled the first notice and stuck another notice on the walls stating the official maintenance of Sheikh Issa in his own capacity and the appointment of Sheikh Ahmed as his deputy, j.-rom this date they took into their own hands all the axj.aiis 01 Banrein, But tne imiabitants remained on strike and did not obey Sheikh Ahmed, The Davasar clan even immigrated i-rom Bahrein to Ghatif and other tribes made preparations to immigrate, but as all the lands and property of Davasar were confiscated the rest did not dare to move. These people however did not fail to protest through the press of Persia, Sgypt and Syria, they demanded justice and made the world hear their cry. They even gave a power of attorney to a lawyer to file a suit in the courts of Bombay against the dismissal of Sheikh Issa and a subscription amounting to 300 to 400 thousand rupees was collected for this purpose. But they could not do anything and poor Sheikh Abdol Wahhab died. In addition they despatched a representative with letters to Tehran but as the Persian Government owing to lack of Navy could not help them the representatives returned disappointed. In all this discussion the ■'Times'' is illogical and this ill h ) it- 10 - this is our answer to it and we wonder indeed why the English newspapers which are famous in the world for their thorough investigation of reports have published such unfounded and nonsensical statements. I think we must admit that they purposely ignore facts although they are aware of them.0 0 0 N F I DENTIAL NO.122-0.of 1928 British Agency Consulate Bandar Al3'bas, April 23, 1928 Sir, lith reference to my letter No.70-0. dated the 26th March last, the Consular Agent at Lingah has now reported that the Deputy Governor of Lingah in his letter No.69 dated the 18th Farwardine 1307 (- 7th April 1928) returned to him the originals of the communications adoressed 'by his predecessor to the Governorate and the Director of Customs respectively informing them of the removal of the restrictions previously notified, in regard to passengers desirous of proceeding to Bahrein.

The French-Minister at Tehran stated on 17th July,1899, that he.had been given to understand that the British Resident f at Bushire -would accord protection to natives of the Baihrein Islands living at various ports in the Persian Gulf. He asked for confirmation upin this point in view of the fact that certain questions had arisen 'between these natives and French citizens. Sir M.

In reply to your lfo.179 S I return herewith Teheran despatch No.79 and enclosures,your office notes and my additional remarks. The latter are based on H conversation with 11 .E.Sheikh Hamad and his brothers and certain extracts from huham- raad Khalifa al Habhan's History of Bahrein. 2. ^ copy of the Diwan of Saiyid Abdul Jalil was lent to me by Sheikh Mahomed bin Isa, and from it I took the extract which is attached to my notes. Political Agent.BahreinConfidential . 1» According to A1 Habhan's history, Nadir Shall when his kingdom took a stronghold, wrote to his Govern or in Shiraz, Mir2a Taqi Khan, ordering him to seize Bahrein from the hands of Sheikh Jahbara, He obeyed his orders, invaded Bahrein with a large force and conquered it. Sheikh Jahbara himself was away from Bahrein in the holy city of Meccajhis viceroy could not withstand the army of Mirza Taqi Khan, so he took to flight and the soldiers of Uadir Shah got hold of Bahrein, This took place in the year 1150 A.H, Hext year (1151) Saif 'bin Sultan, the ruler of Muscat invaded Bahrein and after bringing about a general slaughter became its master;but in the following year (1152) Kadir Shah issued orders in the name of his governors Muhacamad Taqi Khan and Ali Khan, bidding them to put the ruler of Muscat to death. They, thereupon crossed to Muscat and put him to death. After his death, Nadir Shah again became the master of Bahrein and appointed Al Mazkur to govern it on his behalf. These were Sheikh Ghaith and Sheikh Kasir ' ai Hazkur, E, The writer of Sheikh iibdulla bin Ahmad*s letter to the Governor of Shiraz was Sheikh Abdul Jalil, the po£t of Bahrein, whose book was printed in Bombay,The reply is given in full in the book, I am attaching a copy with its translation. It is mostly flowery no things, The portion I have marked does however appear to profess some sort of allegiance. Sheikh Mahomed bin Isa says that the whole letter is merely a polite and flowery rejection of the Governor's proposals. It seems to me difficult to determine where polite persiflage ends and real business begins. Perhaps you may be able to check the translation of the portion I have marked and see if it bears a definite interpretation. A rather important point made by Sheikh Mahoied and confirmed by his brothers is that at the time of this visitW\ visit Sheikh AMullft was not the Head Sheikh. The Ruler was Sheikh Sulaiaan (from whom Sheikh Isa is descended)» Sheikh Abdulla, his brother was merely associated with him, in the way that Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa was af terwards associated with Sheikh Abdulla and even Ahmed bin Ali, Sheikh Isa^ brother was associated with him in the early days of Sheikh Isa's rule* The associated re lation enjoyed very large revenues and was a super coun sellor and commander of the armies. His influence in the at lairs otthe State was immense but he was not the head, Muhammad al Habhan makes no mention of the incident but he gives the date of the death of Sheikh Sulaiman and the succession of his brother Abdulla as 1236 A.H. Uabhan aftexjdescribing the events leading to the, defeat of Sheikh Abdulla says ' Thenhe (Sheikh Abdullaj went to Fars, where he scattered his army, every tribe in a small town and himself put up, together with his companions in a small town in Kaband called ETakhl Hashil. There was a consiberable number of all tribesmen with Sheikh Abdulla and there was a considerable number of their followers as well, Theyi^ some of the sons of Sheikh Abdulla went to Damam ( on the Arab coast south of C^atif) and took their re sidence there. He himself went to Kuwait to seek the help of its ruler Al Sabah, but did not succeed in his &lt;•*- object; the&gt;jhe proceeded to Hejd when^also he could se cure no support. Then in the year 1265 he set out to Muscat to secure the help of Sultan Sa£yid Said, but wh«n he reached there he died,' Sheikh MohamAd bin Isa says that Sheikh Abdulla bin Ahmed went .to Kuwait but sent his family to Bedha Khan ac at Asalu, From Kuwait he went to Nejd to ask help from Faisal bin Saud but was refused. He then went to Muscat and died there. His family went to Damam and some of them i,e, theV\P the descendants or his son Mubarak are still in Hasa, Ti^ey have gardens in Q.atif but never possessed a single, garden in Persia. It is true that a number of Abdulla , s followers eiaig grated to Persia, but the reason is that they were traders by sea. They depended on their trade with India for a livelihood so went to ports on the trade route. Their move was certainly not due to any desire for 1ersian nationality. It must be remembered that at cwXZ&amp;X that time^Persian rule on the sea coasts did not exist 4. Mahacxad al Nabhan speaking of Sheikh Mahataqd bin Khalifa says ' There are fanous stories current about him, some of which I will produce for the sake of enjoyment/and evidence ( of his chaste Judgment, acute genius, clear perception and quick penetration x into the interpretations of dreams). It was his in genuity that he hoisted an Ottoman flag on the south west tower of Galah Abi Mahir and a Persian flag on the south east, so that whenever either of the sove reignties imposed dominion on him, he alleged his con nection with the other and thus remained safe. But CU fire of jealousy inflamed the hearts of the ingljsh, who could not bear to see his union with the two Muslim^ powers and consequently instigated the Arabs and his nobles to rise against him. On account of his extreme vigilance, they could not extract anything from him till 26 years had passed over his rule. In describing Col.Pelly^ first attack on Port Abu Mahir Mohamed Nab^an says ' The Consul counted his (Sheikh Mahomed*s) going away as a further proof of his violation of the agreement and as flying away from retribution, so he ordered his ship of war to direct guns against Qalah Abi Mahir, which was demolished so that the two flags, the Ottoman and Persian, which Sheikh Muhammad had hoisted over it fell down.' Sheikh Mahomed bijfc Isa says the Persian flag was flyingflying over Abu iialiir 3?ort when Col.Pelly borabarded it at his first attack. He says there is no proof that SheiMi Mahomed bin Khalifa accepted Persian nationali ty. kfeien he was turned out of Bahrein he looked to Arabs and not Persians wasv assistance» 5, Ifabhanjioes not mention Merakhi, Sheikh iiohamed bin loa however knows about him. He says that Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa was not the ruler at the time he sent Meva.i.kJuA.0Persia, Sheikh Mahomed may have been living in Bahrein with the permission of his brother Sheikh Ali at the time, but tne rule had passed to his brother Ali and the sending of Merakhi was merely one of his intrigues to win back the rule. The wording of the newspaper article bears out Sheikh Mahomed bin l3a , s contention. Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa was ob viously smarting under his defeat and was seeking al lies wherever they could be found. 6, It is not known whether Persian troops were despatched and turned back. They certa-inly never landed. If the warships acted as the newspapers say, it is a point adverse to the Persian claim, 7, Habhan* s description of the affair is as fol lows : - The battle of Azzila (1286), Sheikh Mahomed equipped an army from Darin ( on Tarut island near Q,atif) consisting of Bani Hajir and Sheikh Kasir bin Mubarak A1 Abdulla ( he was grandson of the former Sheikh Abdulla bin Ahmed A1 Khalifa) had made a promise to help him, so he accompanied him among his followers. When they landed, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa came out with a large army, the rest of Al Abdulla, with Sheikh Muhammed bin Abdulla at their head, being in his com pany with their followers and dependants. Sheikh Ali however suspected their attherence when he learnt the alliance of their brothers with Sheikh Muhammad bin KhalifaKhalifa, so lie asked tiieza to renew the agreement,which they did. Then Sheikh Ali sent his son Sheikh Ihrahim to A1 Ahdulla coramanding them to attack the forces of his brother (Sheikh Muhaaaaad), They expressed their consent and obedience, but when he (Sheikh Ibrahim) turned his back to go to his father's army, Sheikh Muhaaamad bin Mubarak and a man from Bani Haj ir assaults ed him so he died. A1 Abdulla thus exhibited themsel* vea as enemies of Sheikh Ali, A fierce and bloody battle then took place between the armies of Sheikh Muhammad and A1 Abdulla and that of Sheikh Ali, Sheikh Ali was killed and his army dispersed. It was the highly cherished desire of A1 Abdulla to see Al Salman (i.e.the present rulers) reduced to the situation which comes to pass through division and dissension. when Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa came back and his brother was killed they considered it a proper oppor tunity, so they alleged that they were the cause of Sheikh Muhammah bin Khalifa's victory. They even went a step further and assumed that they had a better righ^T to the kingdom than he. They kept waiting for a favour able opportunity till one day they got hold of Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa whom they imprisoned in ^alah Abi Mahir, Theiteldest brother Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdulla be came the ruler. After this Sheikh Isa bin Ali went to Q,atar, All his brothers and cousins followed him except his bro ther Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali who went to ITejd, XX XX Before 3 months were over the English Consul at Bushire whdfname was Bailey (Pelly) came to Bahrein in /I his war ship and consulted the tribes and people about whom they would like to be their ruler, All of them agreed to send for Sheikh laa, so the Consul wrote to him/'N liiia to come to BaJarein, He readied Bahrein with his own tribe, the tribe A1 Kuaim and hia followers and put up at Muharraq* When he saw the Consul the latter told him that it was the desire of the people of Bahrein that he should become their ruler. He effected an agreement with the Consul and ascended the throne. The Consul on his arrival had enquired of Sheikh Muhammad bin ^bdulla concerning Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa and had been told that the latter had been killed in the fight* lifter enquiry however the Consul came to know that he was imprisoned in Q.alah A^Mahir. So he surrounded it with his naval force and placed a number of guns over the Dar ul Hukm in Manama, so that they (presumably the A1 Abdulla) fled away with their Chief Sheikh Kasir bin Mubarak, When Sheikh Isa bin ^li had arrived with his army, the spacious world had become narrow in the eyes of Sheikh Muharamad bin Abdulla, so that he now sought refuge in the English war ship. The Consul refused him at first but when he explained that if he were to remain in Bahrein, he would be murdered, he took him in along with his brother's grandson Sheikh Ali bin Nasir bin Mubarak, Then the ship sailed off with him and with Sheikh Muhatamad bin Khalifa.' Sheikh Hamad and his brothers assure ate that Nab- han , s description of the incidents described is subs tantially correct. They say that Lorimer is wrong in stating that Muhammad bin Abdulla was holding Rifa in the name of Sheikh All (page 397) and they insist that Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifa was confined in Abu Mahir as prisoner of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdulla, the usurper and was reecued by Col.Belly.

Political. Agent,Bahrein. Bahrein,6th May 1928, I i *\3&gt; Translation of a letter alleged to have been written by one of the ruling Shaikhs of A1 Khalifah Fatiily to Wali of Shiraz i.e. Mirsa Husain Shah Zadeh son of Shah Fateh All King of Persia* in way as the letter appears quoted in the Diwan compiled by one Abdul Jalil Baori. May God support firmly the props of islain and make the sanie deep-rooted ; may He strengthen the loop of Faith and make the same firm# may He ripen the gardens of the Hanifi Religion and make the same to put forth loaves# may He fill the cisterns of the Muhammadan Creed and make the same abundantj may He cheer up the hearts of the Faithful arid make the same shine» arid may He disunite the union of the resisting party ( of foes) and disperse the same through the existence of His Highness ( Wali of Shiraz extolled as) the offshoot of the Conquering Authority and product ( son) of the possessor of an admirably handsome dominion ( i.e.King Fateh Ali Shah of Persia) who ( Governor of Shiraz) is possessed of such energies as before which ( the two proverbially powerful stars known as they are near the pole of the lesser bear) n Farqdan w lack power and who has a perfect knowledge of the orbit of ' Farqdan' even though he may not see the actual ' Farqdan', Such an extolled personage is the king ( Wali of Shiraz) whose shrewed horses are the crowns of Chosroes sect of Kings and who has&gt; by dint of his vehement terror# caused the prawling rebels to humiliate their noses ( i.e. bow down their heads by way of sub mission). Such rebels then have become subdued reduced as they are to a low status. He has also made the ess tensive©xbensiv© p&amp;fcina of the East flow ( with blood) as a result of hi3 vigorous actions of cutting ( his foes* throats. So the circlo of his authority 1,0, his doiainion vsith all its surrounding and impregnable countries acquired as these are with the fore© of his imposing swords, has become a sort of difficult point for the aggressors and a torch irradiating his power and authority in the hearts of mischief-mongers« it is he who removed the night like dark veil from ( the face of) Adventures with the lamp of his opinion as also he made to disappear all causes ofl distress and misery by ( extending) the hand-palm of his vigilance, it is again he who has spread the bed-sheet of peace over all the corners of his country as also it is h© who is a uriitor of his entire subjects by dint of the balance of his justice. Again it is the same energetic personage who has showered favour of his beneficience and bounty on the pastures of those that are sincere whose tongues scentiHated with the prism like offer of en2bogy and thanks due to him. So his vast edifice is so to speak a safe pasture for the freed (slaves) and his gateways are unconquerable forts for the shelter-seekers. He is the support of country son of a king occupying the throne m the centre and a chofiost pillar namely the most reverend and esteemed Shah Zadeh ( son of Shah Pateh All and Wall oi Shiraz), May he attain the good and benefit from God and may his fortune-star not cease from ascending to the constellation of prosperity and may the moon of his eminence continue shming m the centre of his perfection. Amen, Then 1 offer to this hoblo personage ( ray) best com pliments and salutation and wish God to shower his universal mercy and constant blessing on him. As to the purport of this letter ( we submit that) there reached us from your pleasant and flowery courtyard and High and grand vestibule a despatch ( for understandingV 7 the eloquence of which) the (famous) orators tarried to stop into the yard ( contents) of the letter i.e.the con tents of the letter were understood with much difficulty even by the expert litterateurs of the day and even the powerful tongues (seemed to) lack power for making out the sense, of its contents, it is comprised of an entirely per fect eloquence and ( doubtless) its writer was endowed with I the gift of Rhetoric and eloquence. So neither Abdul Kamid I nor ibn Raugha ( the then contemporary orators of renown) could reveal the morning light of its shield from the nigbt- like dark veil of its lines and prases, so its nightingale warbled in varied rhymed tunes, the rains of proficiency shed its showers over the yard of its gardens and the brooks of eloquence gushed out of its flowing cisterns and its flowers blossomed out and its birds warbled joy fully, This place became beautiful ( by its advent), the eyes enjoyed delight ( by its sight) and God willing all the matters arid affairs turned out better. So we found it fairer than the complete moon of the 14th night and purer than the drizzles when these shower down from the clear cloud. The (above) letter contains a request for our coming into the string of subjugation and our coming within the shelter of concession ( compound) so that ( the wall of Shiraz) may use us as arrows and swords - He preferring us for this - for the overthrow of his enemies and so that he may use us ( as instruments) in slaughtering those that have deviated from his allegiance and so that he may ex tirpate with our help the glory of those who deny him obedience and follow mischivious ways ever after subjugation and so that he may sincerely gam over from us the pure friendship that may be free from the impurjties of disunion t and whose sweetness of taste may not be embittered by the bitterness-4- 'IP 1 bitterness of disunion. r, . So we acquaint him with ( our ) disposition which I our ancestors have so far been following up arid ( our) t eiaperauent that our forefathers have comaitted to our charge ( and this is) that we do not turn back from the friendship of those for whom we cherish sincerity and do not hesitate from gripping the loop of allegiance of those whose leadership we consider incumbent and our documents are never defiled with the filth of contra- dict/ion after their ratification and we never substitute ( t/.iQ wraps oi ) disooedience and sin for ( the gannent of) deference. This being the case how can we not be so and we righteously behave in these ways with those to whom obedience is inevitable and whose friendship is a boon and whose loyal friends are in utmost glory and in enjoyment of blessings and whose foes are in misery and painful tortures. Whereas this(fact) became clear to us, we received the esteemed despatch in a state of ut most, glory, esteem and respect and we felt as if a noble / (heavenly) letter has been inspired to (us) and we acted upon the wishes it explicitly conveyed and we entered the yard of your- noble orders through the gate of obedfence and we thanked God the bountiful and gracious as he granted us success m taking the righteous path and diverted us from the paths of enemity and brightened our eyes with the appositeness it ( the letter) contained. And we received the bearer of your esteemed despatch i.e. your servant Iskandar Khan m utmost glory and respect and we met him with the utmost pomp and beneficience and with tne extreme respect and glory and with the utmost esteem and welcome and we contracted friendship with him as we found him to be a well wisher of your admirable Government arid-6- and an attainor of high rarika of pre-emption in the service of your grand-vestibule. The nesaanger iskajiidar Khan is (doubtless) a good individual and i swear by my age that he gave a (good piece of) advice and(said) what he was entrusted with and he was not dishonest ( in this act of his). Since we found him as we described him above we were willing even to tolerate his short comings. At the time when wE^entrusted him with our word (of message) So take from him what he conveys from us and what he takes care of. We have explicitly stated to him what we intended( to say). May your days be prosperous ( of smiling teeth) and may all of your frontiers be encompassed with your care and may the publj)© be obedient to your orders throughout all ages and days through the intercession of prophet Muhammad and His moon-like shining posterity.Confidential m &gt;0^' ]((/ No.sis-Ny^?^.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 117, I have the honour to transmit to-you herewith a translation from the Moscow Radio of the speech made by the U.S.S.R. Ambassador in Tehran at a dinner which he gave to certain representatives of the local press on the 26th April, wherein reference was made to the question of Bahrein between Great Britain and Persia. ( 2. ^ The first paper to issue an abridged report of what the Ambassador said was the 'Tufan,' a Bolshevik subsidised newspaper, and it may have exaggerated the remark regarding Bahrein which the Ambassador made, by reporting that the Russian Soviet would help the Persians in that matter. Two days later, however, other papers printed full reports of the speech, and these tally with the Moscow Radio report, which only mentions that public opinion in the Soviet Republics expresses sympathy with Persia in the question of Bahrein. All the reports, however, agree that M. Davtian made as much play as was possible with the imperialistic bogey. 3. A very sober reply was made to this speech by Malik Shuara, a Deputy journalist, thanking M. Davtian for his expressions of friendship and studiously avoiding any reference to Bahrein. This omission was seized upon by the editor of ' Nahid,' a vulgar picture paper of Tehran, who rose and said that as Malik Shuara had not taken notes of M. Davtian's speech, he had forgotten an important point in it, namely, the question of Bahrein, adding that it was an inseparable part of Persia and that the latter would succeed in securing its right. Another pressman made a similar speech, explaining that if Malik Shuara had not mentioned the question of Bahrein, it was because it was so obviously clear that it needed no explanation, and that only when somebody tried to prove that day was night and night was day, would it be necessary to enter into explanations regarding Bahrein. 4. Following these intrusions, Malik Shuara again rose and gave the history of Bahrein and its relations with the British. He finally expressed appreciation at the sympathy of Persia's friends, and said he hoped Persia would regain Bahrein, which was populated chiefly by Persians. 5. As reported in my telegram No. 121 of the 29th April, I took the opportunity of an interview with the Minister of Court to enquire whether his Excellency approved of foreign representatives making such speeches. Would it have been agreeable to the Persian Government if last year, when about thirty Persian merchants were kept languishing in jail at Baku without trial and the Persian press was working itself into a state of excitement, I had given a dinner to the chief editors in Tehran and expressed the sympathy of His Majesty's Government with these unfortunate merchants? The two questions were, indeed, very different. I merely cited this as the sort of instance in which I might have earned a little cheap popularity on the lines employed by M. Davtian, although I added that, had I done so, my Government would most probably have shown their disapproval of such methods of diplomacy by recalling me. 6. Taimourtache at once replied that he entirely disapproved of speeches such as that reported to have been made by the Soviet Ambassador, and he would take the first opportunity of telling him so. Persia had no desire for the gratuitous sympathy of third parties. She was quite capable of looking after her own interests. A copy of this despatch, with its enclosure, is being sent to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. •-W /p- /V R H c ' LrvF / / /tc.-V/Z-*, 'f- ft [464 x—2]Enclosure in No. 1. The U.S.S.R. (Translation.) . t ohran ON the 26th April a big dinner was given to the representatives 01 tne press and the Soviet economic organisations. Representatives 01 the newspapers an journals were present. In welcoming the representatives of the press, Dav lan, e U.S.S.R. Ambassador, said the following in his speech : ' Respected representatives of the press, -.1,^1, ' I am very pleased to see you to-day at the Embassy, together with the representatives of our economic organisations. I hope that by this inen y meeting we shall still more strongly fortify the friendly relations which already so happily exist between us. ' The press in all countries is of enormous importance, and exercises a great influence on public opinion. The press is more particularly important m a country like Persia, where great efforts are being made towards reform, and where a new life is developing. By the publication of daily reliable information and an accurate description of events, the press has the power to assist in the efforts which are being made to strengthen Persia's independence, to improve the economic position of the country, and to carry out reforms. In this respect the Persian press has an especial responsibility. At the present moment Persia is confronted with a whole series of historical problems. At the present moment the Persian Government is making decisive strides towards the emancipation irom unequal treaties which have fettered Persian independence over a long period of years. ■ This task is extremely difficult and demands a correspondingly great amount of support from the public opinion of the whole country. You know that there are several Powers which have not, so far, consented to relinquish those privileges which they now enjoy thanks to their policy of possession, and which do not desire to enter into the way of full and equal rights in their relations with the Persian people. ' I am convinced that the efforts of the Persian Government will be crowned with success, and that Persia will succeed in freeing herself from these unjust, imperialistic and unequal treaties. You may rest assured that, in this task, the Persian Government and Persian public opinion will meet with, in the person of the Soviet Union, as always, a most reliable and, a most dependable, friend. ' Public opinion in the Soviet Union follows with great sympathy the efforts which the Persian Government is making in insisting upon the territorial integrity of Persia against the grabbing policy of Imperialists. The fight which the Persian Government is making for the Bahrein Islands, which belong to Persia, elicits particular sympathy. ' The policy of the Soviet Government towards the Persian people has always been a policy of friendly co-operation and sincere neighbourly goodwill. This policy emanates from a sincere desire to meet the Persian people in their efforts to improve their political and economic situation. ' This policy is wholly sincere because we should like to see Persia a strong country and economically powerful and independent. In this respect the policy of the Soviet Union is sharply distinguished from the policy of several imperial Powers which are endeavouring to accomplish the exact opposite, viz., the weakening of Persia. It is in their interests that Persia should always remain weak so that she may not be able to oppose their plans. ' The October revolution not only freed the peoples of the U.S.S.R. from the Tsarist knout, but it avenged those grabbing and oppressing activities which were perpetrated by the Tsarist Government in relation to Persia. ' Tremendous problems of economic development now confront the Persian people, and very great efforts in this connexion are now being made. In those efforts you may count upon the friendly assistance and the maximum co-opera tion on the part of the Soviet Union, and especially on the part of the Soviet economic organisations working in Persia. ' Our economic relations have undoubtedly been improved and strengthened by the agreements signed last October, and hope that we may still furtherQGJXwim'wnjg, . D.O.

During the month of May His Excellency Shaikh Hamad showed me a letter he had received from the Kabir of 'Ali who complained taat iChan Bahadur Muhammad Skarif, a lead •mg Persian merchant, and , Ali bin Husain the Secretary of the Manamah Municipality had interviewed him at the Khan Bahadur^ ^aruen soon after night fall. They asked him to obtain for them signatures to a memorial to the Persian Government complaining of the tyranny of the British Government and of the A1 Khalifah family and ask -ing for the inclusion of Bahrain in the Persian Empire. I question«lthe writer of the letter and ♦Ali bin Husain cind decided that there was insufficient evidence to take up the matter. Khan BaHxlur Muhammad Sharif has many enemies in Bahrain and the friends of the late Secretary of the Municipality, 1 Ali bin Khalifab, are always trying to discredit 'Ali bin Husain. 3. In a letter dated 4th August my Indian Assistant reports that 'All Mn Husain ha8 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ StJ i .

They have been advising the villagers to gain the sympathy of |jhe Persian Government whose big official will be coming to Bahrain in the Pahlevi man-of-war at the end of Safar. % Assistant further reports that a secret meeting was held at 'Abd •Ali bin Rajab's house, which was attended by 'Ali bin Husain, Khan Saiiclur Muhammad Sharif, Hajji Hasan bin Marzuq. of Sitra and others. A petition address -ed to Tehran was drawn up and was sent Iby dhow to Bushire, Later Khan Sariaur MuhammadrSahrif, 'Ali bin Husain and Jasim Kanoo went to Sitra to meit Hajji Hasan bin Marzuq,, the Eabir of this island, who is a most unscrupulous individual.

He has been staying with Hasan bin Husain Minavi and has been going round coffee shops and the private majlis of Persiams and Sahrattia. It is suspected that he is a Bolshevist spy so he has been put under observation, 5.

Legal status of Persians would also lead to same difficulty which exists in Iraq and presence of Agent would produce a demand for a siiailar concession at Koweit and Dibai. Also Ibn Saud would insist on'the recognition of his Ag ent and the clash of powerful interests would bo diminish his power as to make hia a figurehead.

Becognition of Persian accred- -ited agent would have to he forced on the Shaikh, with had reactions along the Arah littoral, would he danger/ous in its local effect, would lead to requests for Persian representatives at Kuwait, etc. and would make x similaa and possibly even more dangerous claim on the part of Ihn Saud hardly resistible and ( unless we declared an out and out protectorate) would weaken our own position _____ , which is based largely on our admitting no guardian-ship of foreign interests other than ourselves. As for its efficiency as a face saver to Persia, after her open claim to full sovereignty it weems unlikely to reconcile her even temporarily.

Question has again been considered by us but objections feel appear to lose little force even if Persia could be induced as condition precedent to waive all claims to suzerainty or sovereignty over Bahrein, I which seems doubtful. We therefore still incline to the view that in the long run policy of no compromise would be best. This refers to your telegram No.3058, dated the 26th instant.I!

Cv The Daily Press has recently announced and our representative has heard officially in the Persian Gulf that the Persian Government has put forward a claim for the ownership of the Bahrein Islands. i Owing to the difficulty of obtaining information as to the position and outcome of the Persian Government's claim, my Company has been compelled to delay closing certain financial arrangements with its associates who are providing part of the capital for the development work,as the Directors are unable to give to such associates the definite assurance they require that the Bahrein Islands will not pass out of the hands of the Present Bahrein Government into those of the Persian Government. I am to ask if you would kindly give my Company any information which will make the position clear and enable it to give the assurance required. I am, etc., S d. H.A.ADAMS, Secretary, E. &amp; G.
