Correspondents in the file include the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle), and representatives of the India Office (Roland Tennyson Peel; John Percival Gibson), Admiralty (C Wallworth), and Petroleum Division (F C Starling). The letters include detail of the value and extent of spare stocks kept at Bahrain by the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO), and reference to the AIOC having already made their own provision for a store of spare parts in case of a restriction on supplies due to war.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty Secretariat, Military Branch</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Division</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Equipment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000b0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
