The recoomended plan is given in paras. Id to 24. This plan can only be provisional until it is ascertained whether the oil fields will develop. 3. I would be grateful for any re.aarks or suggestions on the recommended plan and appreciation in general before any action is taken in regard to forwarding the appreciation to the Air Ministry.

Memorandum Reference Air Officer Commanding^ sec 10647/4/Air.0., dated the 6th February 1939, forwarding an appreciation in respect of the defence of Qatar. 2. Since admittedly this appreciation is designed for temporary purposes pending fuller information of the possi- bilities of oil development in Qatar X need not make any leng thy comment. I have the following remarks in regard to details Paragraph 2 of the Appreciation It gives a somewhat incorrect impression to say that the cret letter No. peninsula is practically uninhabited in the interior, since at most times there are large numbers of nomads. It would be more correct to say: “There are practically no permanent habitations in the interior, but at certain periods of the year there are nomads in considerable numbers'*. Paragraph 3 The name of the Oil Company is “Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited' and its camp is roughly two miles inland from the western coast. Paragraph 7 First sentence, last word 'Hummocks' would be more correct than 'Hills'. Last sentence It would be more correct to say: 'There is difficult hilly country/-country (though not high hills) immediately north and north east of the Oil Camp and test well. Paragraph 8 I do not quite understand why Dohah should be named as an important tactical point. It is not actually the Shaikh’s capital, it is a very bad port, and its only importance seems to be that it is the largest 'town' in Qatar. The aerodrome to the north of the town is not, to my mind, well located strategically. Paragraph 11 It is a little disturbing to read that 'With the present number of British squadrons in Iraq and with their commitments in an Empire emergency, it may not be possible to implement our obligations to the Shaikh of Qatar”. If this is so, then no guarantee should have been given; or if His Majesty’s Government approved of a guarantee then surely energetic steps should be taken to ensure that it can be carried out. Paragraph 12 As stated above I think the Dohah landing ground is badly placed. It is 55 miles by road from the Oil Camp which, assuming oil developments, will presumably be the main point of defence. I have personally seen an area about 2 miles from the Zekrit landing, on the road from Zekrit pier to the Oil Camp, which could be cleared and used as an aerodrome very cheaply. The Royal Air Force will presumably wish to verify this view and the Air Liaison Officer might take an early opportunity of visiting Zekrit. In so far as expenditure is concerned, I think the Oil Company will be prepared to meet the cost of clearance provided it is allowed to use its own aircraft in normal times. Paragraph 16/-Paragraph 16 The recommendation to secure the Salwa Wells presumably depends on the existence of a state of war with Saudi Arabia or of anarchy in Saudi Arabia# In other circumstances I do not see how forces operating in conjunction with the Royal Air Force can enter Saudi territory to seize the Wells. To my mind the importance of these Wells is over estimated, and I am inclined to believe that even Bedu forces would not be entirely dependent on them. Nevertheless I admit that Jalwa would be a useful gathering point for such forces. Paragraph 18 I am strongly in favour of encouraging the Shaikh of Qatar to buy four, if not six, Bren or Lewis guns, and mount them on Ford V-8 ’’pick-ups'. He himself is very anxious to have armoured car's, but it should not be difficult to convince him that these will be useless in Qatar, and he will certainly be eager to purchase the next best thing. Paragraph 19 The Shaikh is purchasing 2,25,000 rounds of ammunition. Paragraph 23 I strongly support the recommendation made here for Royal Air Force exercises in co-operation with the Shaikh 1 s forces. Apart from their training value they should have considerable political effect. Political Agent, BahrainSeernt.

With reference to the Honourable Political Resident’s letter C/234 dated 28th June, 1939, herewith copy of a report made by Air Liaison Officer, BAHREIN on a reconnaissance carried out by him with the object of selecting suitable sites for a possible landing ground near the ’’Petroleum Development (QATAR) Ltd.” oil camp on QATAR Peninsular. The re rt also includes a paragraph on the suitability of D0IIAT-ES- ZEKRIT as an alighting area for flying boats. Relevant maps and sketches are also attached. iA-^ lUjMMf-S/i Air Vice Marshal, C ommanding British Forces in ’I raq.COPY s s o p a g. REPORT Oil LAUDING GROUND AID FLYIIIG BOAT ALIGNING AREA &gt; D O HAT-ES-ZEKRIT, QATAR* I left BAHREIN by launch about 0615 hours local time and arrived at the company’s pier at DOHAT ZEKRIT about 1330 hours# where I was met by Mr. DICKSON the Local Manager* We proceeded to the camp which is approximately 6^ miles from the pier. About two miles from the landing stage Mr. DICKSON pointed • to me an area that he considered might be suitable for landing ground; we drove over this in a car but it was rather uneven and very stony. On our arrival at the camp I explained to Mr. DICKSON what area and surface were required for landing ground and was told that I should be extremely lucky if I found anything s litable in the vicinity. Mr. DICKSON had a certain amount of flying experience in the Canadian Air Force during the war which v/as a great help to me as he has some idea as to what would and what would not make a landing ground. The following morning we started early and made an extensive tour of the area up to 15 miles from the camp in search of possible landing grounds. The country in the vicinity of the camp at JA3AL DUKHAN is extremely rough and broken with a lot of odd snapped hills varying from 100 to 300 ft. above the level of the surrounding country, the surface being light sandy soil with a lot of loose stone. The camp is situated on the northern end of a small coastal plain about 4 ^ miles by a mile which is generally soft and sandy with harder ridges running through it. The result of my search was the discovery of three possible areas marked 'A’', 'B' and n C' on the attached nap. I will deal with these three areas separately. AREA 'A'. On the sandy coastal plain about a mile south of the camp consists of soft sand to the depth of about a foot, the car, a 'Ford V8 n Saloon, fitted with large tyres did not sink appreciably when driven on straight course, but the surface begins to cut up rather badly if one braked hard or if the car was turned two or three times in small diameter circle. The loading of a car of this type is very light and the surface in its present state would not support aircraft. The area is large enough to get a minimum run of 800 yards in any direction and in the opinion of Mr. DICKSON and myself, if oil was found a landing ground could be constructed by laying down heavy oil and sand mixed, or bitumen and sand. Plenty of stone is available for packing if required. The possibi of this area Id be home in mind. AREA 'B'. This is situated some IS miles from the camp on the DOHA road, about two miles Test of UMM AL GAHAB Nells as shown on the attached map. This area is about 900 yards long in a NNW of the direction and an average width of about 300 yards. Surface hard and composed of small gravel and soil and should be hard enough to support any modern aircraft. The length is into the prevailing wind; there is little or no possibility of extension in other direction. A 'Vincent' or 'Valentia'~ could, in my opinion, use this area without further work other txan marking out, though to my mind it is too far from the camp to be of any use. AREA 'G'. This is the area referred to earlier in this report and is situated on DOHAT ZEKRIT road about 4^ miles from the camp. This site is between 70 and 100 ft., above sea level. The surface is composed of four inches of hard packed sand and gravel with larger stone and earth below. It is extremely hard but as shown on the sketch it is not level and there are two undulations running across the area. I succeeded in getting a small 'L' shaped area 400 yards by 190 yards and 200 by 75 which could possibly, with a small amount of work, be /renderedrendered serviceable for old type aircraft and night be extended by 400 yards in length and 100 yards in width by means of levelling. To my mind large amount of levelling would be necessary before it could be made serviceable for modern aircraft, but as I am a flying- boat pilot and have little or no knowledge of modern aircraft, I would prefer to have an expert opinion before definitely approving of, or condemning this area. The hard and stony nature of this sub soil would render any levelling an expensive and slow undertaking and at present the company has no apparatus capable of carrying out this work, though no doubt if oil is discovered they will have grader and tractor etc. I studied DOHAT ZEKRIT carefully on my arrival and departure in the launch and in the afternoon of my second day in QATAR and came to the conclusion that the area is perfectly suitable for flying boats. A run of 2000 yards can be obtained into the prevailing wind and of 700 yards 1TE/S' r direction. The average depth of this run is 8 to 10 ft., a good anchorage is obtainable in lj fathoms at low water springs, with sandy bottom, about 200 yards 350° True from the end of the jetty. The IC T 0R, though open is protected by shoals at the mouth and though a short steep sea may be raised by strong northerlies, it will be impossible for a swell to work up. If regular use by flying boat is contemplated a few buoys showing the limits of the deep water should be laid down. The depth of water at the pier head at low tide is about 4 ft., the average rise and fall of the tide is in the region of 3 ft. There is a crane at the end of the jetty capable of handling weights up to three tons; the jetty is connected to the camp by telephone. The camp has a Tireless Station, the particulars of which are as follows :- Gall Sign :- DOH. normal working wave length of :- 745 meters. Honrs of working;- 0600 &amp; 1000 G.M.T. (This watch carried out with Gable and 'ireless, BAHREIIi) . Transmitter :- Marconi type TT5C1 Power :- i- K.7. Range of wave length 12 - 2000 meters. Type of transmission :- CV/, ICT.7 or telephony. The wireless operator is an ex-R.A.P. wireless operator mechanic. In conclusion it is considered that areas ’’B 1 ' and 'C' could be used by experienced pilots in old type aircraft such as 'Vincents' without further work, other than marking out. There is no site suitable for landing ground for modem aircraft without extensive levelling operations. As the company are desirous of constructing an aerodrome for their own use if oil is found, I suggest that we wait until oil is found as we shall not want a landing ground on this site if the oil is a failure. The Company will construct a landing ground to our requirements for their own and our use. In this case I suggest site 'A' treated with either oil or bitumen. I enclose one map of QATAR for retention, and a tracing of the map from which I want three blue prints made and the tracing returned, and a copy of a chart of DOHAT ES ZEKRIT which I want copied and four copies sending to me as this one has been borrowed from P.D.Q. Ltd., who want it returned. Sgd. R. GOATES. Squadron Leader, Air Liaison Officer, BAHREIII.Form 110. C. 3.1S r' Copy o! Telegram FROM PETBQLEUM-CQNGES^TONS-, T0 LIMITED, BAHREIN.

Meanwhile, it occurred to me that you may possibly be able to call on some other source to supply us with some extractor springs (I suggest a dozen) and at least sixty chargers, a com bination of broken extractor springs and no chargers reduces the efficiency of the six Qatar riflemen very considerably.

As regards the general letters to the ttulor of Qatar and to the Truclal Coast Shaikhs, drafts of which were for warded by you under you letter doted the 3rd June, I would prefer to keep these with me and to issue letters on the same lines direct to the Rulers concerned in case of an emergency arising. The draft for Muscat of course should be sent to the Political Agent, there, as Muscat is outside my jurisdiction. 5. As regards passport arrangements, I am afraid these hove to remain as they are for the present. If there is time we will issue visas to your American employees; other wise emergent arrangements will have to be made for their entry into India. As regards Portugese Indian subjects, the above arrangements will also apnly.As regards Iraqis these v; ill have to be returned to Iraq by any means available. British subjects can of course go to India at any time provided their passports are valid for India. I will ensure that there is no difficulty about staying at Sharjah in transit. 6. As regards the rifles and S.A.A. these have already been handed over to you. 7. As regards the desirability of putting wells, engines, vehicles etc. out of action, I am not really competent to lay down principles for this, but will let you know if I receive any instructions.

We would like to draw your attention to the position regarding the six rifles issued to us. They were received on the 11th June and taken to Qatar on the 12th June 1941. When the Engineer-in-Charge inspected them at Qatar, four of the six had broken extractor springs. Two of these four were fitted with extractor springs by the Engineer-in-Charge, and two returned to the Defence Officer for exchange. These two were only two or three weeks in Qatar, and the pitting and corrosion could not have occurred in Qatar. We believe these rifles were stored in Bahrain for over a year. Reference para three of the Defence Officer’s letter, it would seem to us that it is highly probable that the remaining four are in similar condition already, but we are enquiring from the Engineer-in-Charge. We are also asking the Engineer-in-Charge to take the necessary steps to ensure that the rifles in future are kept clean and oiled. Flannelette and oil are available.
