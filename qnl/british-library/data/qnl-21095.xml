I enclose a copy of this letter. Adviser to the Government. R.Z.CQNFILZNTIaL. La.V REaiiELINa Q’^^RSHIP OF LANDED PROPERTY BY FOFiLIGF SUBJECTS. Trie above Law seems to have caused a sensation amongst tne Iranian subjects in Bahrain lately. I have learnt that since the last few days the Iranians(botn Sunnis and Shia’hsjhave been holding meetings ana discussing this problem with a viev; to finding a solution for it. Some of them decided to adopt Bahrain nationality in order to save their property from falling into others 1 hands. Amongst these were Haji Abdul Nabi Busheri and Haji f Abdul Aziz Khunji(who nave actually applied for naturalisation;and others refused to do so and preferred to remain as Iranian subjects partly on their own accord and partly by the influence of more fanatical Iranians. I heard that iibaur Raszaq. son of Haji Muhammad Tayib Khunji is one of those who are deadly against the idea of naturalisation who has in fact prevented nis cousin .nbaur Rahman Muhammad Tahir Ehunji from applying for Bahrain nationality when the latter tried to do so. One of the arguments brought forth by those who are not in favour of naturalisation ; is that the Bahrain G-overnment would not compel the Iranians to sell their lanced property even if they no not chaijge their nationality and that this is said only in order to frighten ana induce them to adopt Bahrain nationality which will put them into trouble later when they happen to go to Iran. It is understood that the Sunni Iranians are more strict in tnis respect than others. 25,7/ January 22, 19^8. \V Dear Weightman, V Regarding the Law regarding ownership of immovable property in Bahrain by foreigners dated 8th May 1937, para 3. It is stated that after one year from publication of notifi cation (November 1, 1937) the Bahrain Government may compulsorily acquire or sell the property, bjit the price to be received by owner in either event is not to be less than the sum determined by Article four. article four lays down the procedure for assessing property. Am I right in assuming that the property of persons, to whom this order applies, who do not submit any lists, should be assessed by the Bahrain Government after the expiry of the three months mentioned in the notification dated Novem ber 1, 1937. Valuable property is owned in Manama by Iranians resident abroad and no lists have yet been received from them. jAven if these persons apply for Bahrain nationality it is improbable that their applications will be accepted as they do not reside in this country. The policy of the Government is to grant Bahrain nationality to Iranians living and working in Bahrain but not to persons living elsewhere. Yours sincerely, R. Leightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. R.rr,n-fl -ential. D.0.No.C/86-1.a/24. 30th January 1938. iaas askBd for an int&gt;ex*pre'tat&gt;ion of a cer-» tain point in connection with the Law regarding ownership of immovable property in Bahrain• Aa apparently this lav; was drafted and approved by us I assume that it is our bu siness to construe it* 2# The point is this* Under Article 3 of the Law the Bahrain Government may compulsorily acquire the property of a foreigner belonging to a 'notified otate 1 * f but the price to be received by the owner may not be lees than the sum de termined by the procedure described in Article 4* Article 4 requires that within three months of the date of the foreign country being notified, every foreigner v/ho is a subject of that country shall submit a list of his immovable property to the District Court, i.e* to the Political Agent* There after the Bahrain Government appoint an assessor and the owner may do likewise, and in case of disagreement between them the District Court (i.e* the Political Agent) appoints his own assessor to give © final decision* $ow Iran was notified on November 1st, 193? and the three months expires tomorrow. 3o far only one Persian national has submitted s list of property, fcy information is that there has been a good deal of discussion amongst the Persians whether or not they should acquire Bahrain nationality in order to assure their property, and there is a strong party which believes that/- i* ble Lieutenant-Colonel Ur Trenchard Fowl®, K.C.I.S*, C.B.K., Political ;&amp;siaent in the Persian Gulf, Bush Ire.that the Property Law is only a bluff by the Bahrain Go vernment to induce Persians to acquire Bahrain nationality. Consequently there is quite a number of Persian property ovners who do not propose either to acquire Bahrain nation ality or to submit lists of property. There are also some big Persian property owners who do not reside in Bahrain and naturally none of these have sent in lists either. Anyway, whatever the reason may be, there can be no doubt that we shell have numbers of Persians who do not comply with Article 4 of the Property Law in submitting lists. The law contains no definite provision for the action to be taken if such lists are not submitted. The obvious sol ution is for the Bahrain Government to proceed ex parte, appointing their own assessor who will submit his report to the District Court, end the District Court should, I think, automatically accept that assessment unless it is satisfied from any infomatlon in its possession that the assessment is deliberately partial. Then on the expiry of the year prescribed in Article 3 the Bahrain Government will proceed either to acquire the property or to sell it. 3. Since| however, the law was drafted and approved be fore my time I should like to have an assurance that this procedure is correct and to be authorised to inform the Bahrain Government so officially.

V 4W Banrain property J^aw,n nf .y of a, note l T^e Bahrain Property Law is a retaliatory measure and presumably treats the Iranians in the same way as the Iranians treat the foreigners. 2. On the publication oi the notification declaring that the nationals of Iran are prohibited from owning immoveable property in Bahrain such nationals would authmtically come under the ban. But they are under Article 3 given one year’s grace and thereafter their property is liable to be compulsorily acquired or put up for sale by the Bahrain Government. Hie amount of compensation to be paid for such compulsory acquisition or sale is however not to fall short of the amount to be fixed under Article 4. If the foreigner concerned omios to take the requisite steps mentioned in Article 4 h± for the valuation of the prooerty the result would be that there would be no 'sum determined by the valuation prescribed by Article 4' and consequently the HQ compensation payable will be subject to^minimum. The foreigner cannot by his own inaction render the law inope rative. 3. Tne procedure, therefore, to be adopted in the event of a foreign national of a notified country failir^ to take asdLaction under article 4 witnin the prescribed time will not be that of proceeding gx oarte under that Ar^tide fer which there is no provision - but that of proceeding ^ compulsory acquisition or sale under Article 3 as if there were minimum sum payable as compensation. The owner,- or rather the person who used to be the owner - will, there upon, be entitled, if the property is put to sale, to only the actual priee realised at the sale or, if the property is compulsorily acquired, to only such compensation as is considered reasonable, and no more.7aT^&lt;- ii-anslation of a letter dated 23rd ^afar 1357 ( 24th April 1938; from Abdallah bin Ibrahim to the Political Agent, Bahrain, A • I beg to state that X have purchased a plot of land measuring 30 X 40 Dharas equivalent to 45 X 60 feet from Haji i Abdul Aziz Haji Lutf Ali hhunji for Ks.600/-. it is situated near Haji Abdul Aziz‘s garden at Hu rah and bounded on the North and .'est by the land of the seller and on the South partly by the road and partly by the mosque and Ilautah of Abdul Ohaffar bin Ali Akbar and on the Hast by the road and the house of Salman bin Hamadhan Baluchi, usual Bn ding.

V'e have the following observations to offer on the points raised* 2. In the first place, in paragraphs 3 (a) and (b) Fowle uses such phrases as to obtain Persian nationality 41 and M to retain their Persian nationality*’ • Again in paragraph 6 appears the phrase ”obtaining Persian nationality** But it is Persian Law and not Bahreini law which regulates Persian nationality, although the 'master nationality** rule prevents Persian nationality being invoked in Bahrein by a person who possesses duel Bahrein and Persian nationality* It would therefore be more correct in the paragx referred to to refer to 'the right (under Article 2 of tt tionallty Law) to ’’avoid the acquisition of Bahrein nationality' • 3* As regards the two classes of Persian nati mnls to which Fowle refers in paragraph 3 of his letter we are for tae purposes of this letter only concerned with those in category (b), i.e. those who fail to register their property as required by rticle 4 of the Property Law* As regards ius class, the law is now seen to be defective in that it does not provide very clearly what is to happen if a person wh0 register his property fails to do so* One reading which Is a possible one, is t lat the words 'in that event' in tue 3rd sentence of Article 4 (line 7) mean that the owner has )nly the right to appoint an assessor if he has submitted a/ )B on, Esq Office.. llB ^ ; unfortunotely, as Article 4 is drafted, the Bahrein Oovernnent also only gets the rir’-ht to a;&gt; oint an assessor after a list has heen filed. It seems necessary therefore to have a new article (which in turn will necessitate a fresh King’s Regulation as well) in order to fill the gap in the law* 4 . V e suggest therefore that an amending law be enacted on the following lines: 5. At the end of Article after the words M Article 4' add the words 'or Article 5 as the case may be’* and add a new Article 5 - as follows: 'If a foreigner to whom the provisions of Article 3 apply fails to submit a list of his property as required by Article 4, the Bahrein Government may apply to the District Court for the valuation of the property with a view to its compulsory acquisition. In this case the District Court shall give notice to the ov/ner of the property, who shall be permitted to appear, and shall then determine the valuation of the property; and may adopt for its purpose such procedure as the Court shall deem just and appropriate in the circumstance^’ • 6* Under this text the District Court could in fact still allow the owner to appoint an assessor, as in Article 4, and it may be, in many cases, best that it should do so, as we want to go a long way to avoid any reasonable ground of complaint; but it v/ill not do to provide in terms that a man who does not obey the law and register his property is still just as well off as a mm who does* Moreover, even if this amending legislation takes time to effect we think that the District Court should in practice so deal with the matter in the meanwhile, i.e. should in general give a man whose property is to be confiscated a chance of appointing an assessor unless there is something very much against him* 7 * There is Just one other point to which it is necessary to draw attention. In the English text of the Iroperty Law which formed an enclosure to the Political Resident’s/Resident's Express letter No#C/^52 of £4th 3epte’iter 1937 to the Government of India (a copy was sent to us in India Office letter p.Z#6717/37 of 14th October 1937) the words 'benefit, except within the limits required for their” are omitted between the words 'their” f nd 'residence” in Article 1.

My dear Peterson, u In his letter 210/3/30 of the 20th February to Lacy Baggallay Morgan suggested a possible line of defence for use in the event of tne Iraqi Governaient returning to the charge aoout the date of inception of Kuwaiti nationality. 2. While Morgan’s suggested reply mignt serve its purpose, we think that on the whole it is better not to mention to the Iraqi Government our apprehensions about the possiole revival of capitulatory rights* 3. For tne reasons explained in paragraph 2 of Foreign Office despatch No.ddo of tne 13th December, 1934, our main anxiety in the past has beon lest some foreign Power (e•g.the United States of America) might make a claim to such a revival. But we feel that with the passing of time it is now really too late for the United States or any other Government to make such a claim. 4. If therefore tne matter is again raised by the Iraqi Government we tnink there is no longer any reason wny you should not reply as suggested in the relevant part of paragraph 6 of tne Foreign Office despatch referred to above. 5. There is one other point I might mention here. Baghdad despatch No.73 of tne 28th February enclosed the ^ Embassy* s ? U. Cfos- « 3p.

The Shaikh of Bahrain is in fact bound to his Majesty*s Government by treaties which deprive him of tne full attributes of soverigntyj and it is now generally recognised that inter-nationally his Shaikhdom is a British protected state, and it is His Majesty’s Government who are internationally responsible for wnat its ruler does.

It seeras to us doubtful whether the solution suggested by the Govern ent of India Is tenable on a strict interpretation of the text. 3 . But leaving the question of legal interpretation apart, we feel that it is in any case desirable, in order to avoid confusion in the future, that a new icing's Regulation should be published embodying an amendment which makes the position absolutely clear for those who are likely to be affected. Otherwise a Persian subject who had not ecu lied with the provisions of Article 4 might have some justification for complaining, if his property were disposed of in the manner suggested by the Government of India, on the ground that it was not stated that a particular penalty, or indeed any penalty, was involved. 4. Moreover, as indicated in paragraph 6 of my letter of the 2^1 at iteroh, it seems most desirable to avoid giving the Persian Government any presentable cause of complaint or doing anything which might lead to further difficulties with them. 5 . e feel, therefore, that the very least that is required is that if the Bahrein Government do move ex ,arte, they should do so in the sense of putting the assessment procedure/ *4 P.

To The Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN. Sir, I have the honour to address you in connection with the Law regarding ownership of immovable property in Bahrain by foreigners. a / v^\ /r 2. By the terms of Article 4 of Bahrain Government Notice No. 19/1366 dated the 8th May 1937 Persian property owners were required to submit lists of their properties by 31st January 1938. No definite provision, however, is made in the Law to cover the cases of those who failed to register their property. The Adviser (Mr. Belgrave) made enquiries from this Agency as to the correct procedure to be f ollowed in such cases, and ultimately the matter was referred to His Majesty’s Government. A His Majesty's Government have now reached the con clusion that an amending Law is necessary and have accord ingly suggested that such a Law be enacted on the following 'At the end of Article 3, after the words 'Article 4' add the words 'or Article 6 as the case may be' and add a new Article 5 as followss 'If a foreigner to whom the provisions of Article 3 apply fails to submit a list of his property as required by Article 4, the Bahrain Government may apply to the District Court for the valuation of the property with a view to its lines. compulsory/-compulsory acquisition. In this case the District Court shall give notice to the owner of the property, who shall be permitted to appear and shall then determine the valua tion of the property; and may adopt for its purpose such procedure as the Court shall deem just and appropriate in the circumstances.” 3. It will be observed that under this text the District Court could still allow the owner to appoint an assessor, as in Article 4, and it may be, in many cases, best that it should do so, since it is desirable to avoid any reason- 4. In order to regularise the position in the j proposed by His Majesty^ Government, I have been ed to request that the matter be put before His Highness an* explained to him, and that his signature b$ obtained to an amending Law on the lines suggested.

Sir, t I have the honour to refer to the o x uestion of immovable property owned by Persians and the regulation^ govejiing the same issued on 27th Safar 1356 (corresponding to 8th May 1937) ana 27th 3ha 1 ban 1356, (corresponding to 1st November 1937). Within the last 2 or 3 months.a number of applications have been made to the Land Department for registration of gifts by Persian parents to their minor children of immovable property which according to the rules would have to be sold if the parents retained the property. It is clear that these gifts to minors are made in order to evade the regulations. Minors are le^gally incapable of administering properties according to Shera Law. The properties are in fact administered by the parents who will continue to benefit from the properties as ^ before. In this way the Law is ineffective. According to the Nationality Law a minor born in Bahrain of Persian parentage has the option of adopting Bahrain nationality on coming of age. I am unable to aetermine the nationality of minors during the period before they come of age. Gan you advise me on this point? There is now a Government Department (known as the Minors Department controlled by a ^e^lis unuer the presidency of Shaikh Sulman bin Named. I enquire whether you approve of my suggestion that the property of these minors who may in the future become Bahrain subjects or Iranian subjects should be placed under the administration of this !^f' Department till the minors come of age. With reference to the proposed amendment forwarded under your letter No .0/483'-1.a/24 of the 27th July 1938 . According to the Arabic Calendar the year has now expired but if the English Calendar is followed,7 days remain of the year. Would it be possible to issue the amendment before the period expires? I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government. toNo. C/672-1.a/24 Political Agency* Bahrain, the 1st November 1938. To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN Memorandum Reference your letter No. 782 dated the 25th October 1938 in which you raise certain questions regarding immovable property owned by Persians in Bahrain. 2. Though it is highly probable that the object of these gifts by Persian parents to their minor children in Bahrain is to evade the Property Law, it is not, I am afraid, possible to prevent it legally. I understand that there are not a great many such cases and there will not be much time for other similar cases to arise. 3. ith regard to your fourth paragraph I should point out that © child born in Bahrain of Persian parentage is from birth a Bahrain subject and there is no question of his adopting Bahrain Nationality later on. Under the Nationality Law all that can happen is that the parent can apply to have the child registered as a foreign subject within two years of the birth; or the child himself can, on reaching the age of 18, register as a foreign subject. Otherwise he is and remains a Bahrain subject. 4. In regard to the suggestion that the Bahrain Govern ment Minors Department should take over the administration of property gifted by Persian parents to such children, I think you agree with me that it is impossible to apply this suggestion unless all minors* property comes under the/-- 2 - i the control of this Department. In other words It will be necessary for the Bahrain Government to undertake further legislation to place all such property in the charge of the Department without exception, and this would involve the Department in more work than it could manage at present. Clearly discrimination in respect of certain sections of the community is neither desirable nor possible. 5. With regard to your last paragraph, I am awaiting daily the arrival of the new King^ Regulation; and as I have explained verbally it will do no harm if the Amending Regulation arrives a few days after the beginning of November.

This requirement particularly affected Persian (Iranian) citizens in Bahrain, and had an impact on relations with the Government of Iran.The correspondence is principally between the Political Agent, Bahrain (and Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain); the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the India Office; and officials of the Government of Bahrain. There is also correspondence from the Government of India. Enclosures include correspondence from the Foreign Office; HM Minister, Tehran; and HM Ambassador, Iraq.The papers cover: protests by the Government of Iran against the Bahrain property and nationality laws, July 1937, January 1938; the decision to issue a notification that the Bahrain property law applied to Iranian nationals, August-November 1937; interpretation of the Bahrain property law, January-June 1938; a report on the effect of the property law on Iranian subjects in Bahrain, some of whom decided to adopt Bahrain nationality, 25 January 1938 (folio 77); translations into English of approximately thirty letters from individuals to the Political Agent, Bahrain, reporting the ownership of property in Bahrain, with descriptions of the property concerned, January-May 1938; repetition of Iran's claim to sovereignty over Bahrain, May 1938; the need for an amending law to cover the failure to register property when required to do so, March, July-December 1938, resulting in the simultaneous publication of the amending law by the Government of Bahrain, and the
