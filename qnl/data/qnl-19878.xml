The three sheiks informed Hennell that a note had been received from His Royal Highness Feerooz Meerza [Firouz Mirza Nosrat-ed-Dowleh], Prince Governor of Fars, which stated that Sheik Nasir had been deposed from his position as Governor of Bushire. Hennell relays the sheiks' concerns about how they should respond to the Prince's note. Hennell goes on to report that some hours after this visit, he received a deputation of ten of the principal merchants of Bushire, headed by Hajee Mahomed Bakir. The deputation asked Hennell to convey to the Prince its earnest desire that in removing Sheik Nasir from his position, he should not withdraw his favour from those other members of the Al Muskoor family who have done nothing to incur his displeasure. The letter is followed by two enclosures: a translation of a letter from Hennell to the Prince, dated 3 September 1850, in which Hennell states the merchants' concerns; and a list of the aforementioned ten merchants.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000037#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
