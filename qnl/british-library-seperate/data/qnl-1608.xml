Throughout the file, there are items of numerous correspondence with Ibn Sa'ud detailing his subsidy, ongoing conflict with Ibn Rashīd of Ḥā’il and Sharīf Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī of Mecca at al-Khurmah and Turabah, as well as his views on British and French involvement in Syria, Iraq and Palestine.Contained within the file are papers related to Harold Richard Patrick Dickson's 1920 visit to Ibn Sa‘ūd at al-Ḥasa to discuss his subsidy, the Najd Mission to Bombay, the situation in Syria and Iraq, the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and his relations with Sharīf Ḥusayn. Included is Dickson's correspondence (folios 11-14, 33-42, 51-58, 99-103 and 159-199); a list of cash presents made by him (folios 59-60); and 'Diary of Political Agent, Bahrain, during his recent journey to Hassa and back January 29th to February 20th 1920' (folios 61-77, including a rough sketch of the town of Hofuf on folio 66). As a result of his visit to al-Ḥasa, Dickson also compiled 'Notes on the "Akhwan" Movement' which details the history, theology and customs of the Ikhwān movement, the system of Ibn Sa‘ūd's government, and its connection with the movement, and a list of settlements (
                           hijar) established by the movement (folios 105-120). There is also an extract from the Bahrain Political Agent's diary dated 31 December 1919 on the influence of the Ikhwān movement in Bahrain (folios 23-25).In the context of Ibn Sa‘ūd's ongoing conflict with Sharīf Ḥusayn, there are reports of attacks on villages in the vicinity of Taif (folios 212-217); letters written by Sharīf Ḥusayn, Khālid bin Manṣūr, Amir of al-Khurma, and Muḥammad bin Sa‘d bin Ghannām, Amir of Turabah (folios 230-239); and details of a mission from Sharif Faysal to Riyadh requesting Ibn Sa'ud's friendship (folios 242-267). In addition there is correspondence concerning a deputation from Kuwait to Riyadh following rising tensions between Ibn Sa‘ūd and Shaikh Sālim al-Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ as a result attacks by the Ikhwān movement under the leadership of Fayṣal al-Dawīsh (folios 346, 352-363).Also covered in great length within the file are preparations for a proposed meeting between Ibn Sa‘ūd and Sharīf Ḥusayn (folios 204-211, 221-226) in Aden with the possibility of Farḥān al-Rahmah or Dhari Beg accompanying Dickson on the mission (folios 315-318). In various correspondence with Ibn Sa‘ūd it is proposed that such a meeting should take place after the
                           hajjpilgrimage; Ibn Sa‘ūd performing the Hajj; Najd pilgrims should be accompanied by a qualified Indian Muslim officer and a meeting take place in Mecca between Ibn Sa‘ūd and Sharīf Ḥusayn (folios 319-328, 338-343). Khan Sayid Siddiq Hasan, Indian assistant at the Bahrain Agency, is proposed to accompany Najd pilgrims (folios 350-351). Sharīf Ḥusayn agreees to these terms (folios 374, 379). However, due to the requirement to limit the number of Najd pilgrims, Ibn Sa‘ūd is advised to refrain from making pilgrimage himself (folios 435-439 and 444).Also included within the file is correspondence concerning:Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd's visit to London (folios 45 and 92) and the announcement in
