The Double Crown of the beneficent goddess Mut, whose name means &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; characterizes her as a conveyor of kingship and the divine mother of pharaoh. Amun, whose name means &ldquo;hidden,&rdquo; is portrayed as a man wearing a tall, plumed crown. When he appears with a solar disk at the base of the crown, he is known as Amun-Re, who possesses both hidden and solar creative powers. When shown in tightly enveloping garb and with an erection, he may be called Amun-Re-Kamutef, associated with fertility and regeneration. An amulet in this virile attitude would have held the promise of eternal rebirth after death. Monthly rebirth is also invoked by the full and crescent moons of Khonsu, the divine heir of Amun and Mut. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn popular religion the protection of pregnancy and birth was entrusted to such deities as Taweret and Bes. The appearance of Taweret, &ldquo;The Great One,&rdquo; as a pregnant hippopotamus with lion and crocodile features is a dramatic symbol of protective motherhood. The dwarf with a lion&rsquo;s face and legs likely represents Bes, who was worshipped in the home as a protector of motherhood, birth, and rebirth.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2010-05-05", "date_added": "2011-01-20 15:12:51", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "16.246", "object_id": 3165}, {"accession_number": "05.345", "object_id": 3215}, {"accession_number": "05.396", "object_id": 3224}, {"accession_number": "08.480.50", "object_id": 3237}, {"accession_number": "44.120", "object_id": 3464}, {"accession_number": "58.92", "object_id": 3654}, {"accession_number": "71.83", "object_id": 3804}, {"accession_number": "76.38", "object_id": 3853}, {"accession_number": "37.254E", "object_id": 3995}, {"accession_number": "37.950E", "object_id": 4116}, {"accession_number": "51.147.2", "object_id": 65293}], "geographical_locations": [], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.53.179_wwg8.jpg", "id": 75393, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.53.179_wwg8.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.53.179_wwg8.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 72, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 144, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 288, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 576, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1152, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.53.179_wwg8.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": "West Wing gallery 8 installation", "caption": " <em>Inlay in Form of Seated Goddess</em>, ca. 664-30 B.C.E. or later.
