Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, for period from 16th to 31st October 1900. 17th October .—Seih Suleiman reported to me that since he had opened a branch of his shop at Birjand, he had sold 50 camel-loads of green tea bought in India. The tea Mas sold chiefly to Afghans from Herat. He has ordered a large consignment as a second venture. This should be good news for the Indian green-tea grou r er. 18th October. —Mr. Miller, Bussian Vice-Consul, went for a small tour towards the north of Seistan, I am glad 1o say he is very frightened of cross ing the Afghan border by mistake, and this, 1 think, makes him avoid goino- towards Robat. He has often said he wished he knew where the actual Seistan-Afghan border was between the Seistan Bund and Koh-i-Malik Siah. 20 lh October .—Rumours are being maliciously spread, both here and at Birjand, that plague exists in Quetta, and that travellers to India are subjected to annoyance by detention. I have of course contradicted this rumour everv- where. 22 nd October.—-1 started on a tour first to the Seistan Bund, and then along the Afghan border as far as the Naisar. This part of Seistan is the most interesting portion of the country. Along the border live most of the Balu chis of Seistan, whose habit it is to transport their ghi and wool to Quetta. I was able, by visiting nearly all the Baluch villages, to help many to set out on the journey, and to enlighten them about exchange and market values in Quetta. The border, owing to the dispute which exists and on which I have already reported, has in consequence additional interest. I first visited Iskil, where as usual I was well received by Mir Abbas, one of the leading men of Seistan. He was starting several camels to Quetta. He complained to me that in Quetta his men carrying ghi and wool had a very bad reception : being ignorant of the language they were at the mercy of Hindu brokers. These men had in past years swindled the Seistani unmercifully. He pointed out the great drawback there was in Quetta by there being no caravanserai specially allotted for the Seistan trader. The trader was, therefore, obliged to seek the shelter of any merchant who would put him up. This friend-in-need generally turned out to be his worst adviser and largest gainer over business transactions. One man especially he mentioned, viz., Lorinda, whose name was now famous throughout Seistan, as having robbed the Seistani more than any Customs official or Persian Government subordinate. I asked why these men had not appealed to the English Sahib, and the answer he gave me was that during the winter, when the traders arrive at Quetta, the Sahibs were mostly away at Sibi, and if they did present a petition it meant staying in Quetta for a week or more. This delay to a trader with the high price of feeding for camels precluded him taking this step. I was not prepared to believe such stories about Quetta at first, but later in my travels the same story was repeated to me in every village by all classes. The story was not a made-up tale for my ears, for many of the villages were visited unexpectedly, and I heard direct from the traders themselves, without any interpreters, their tale of woe. To very many of them I gave letters directed to Sahibs, and asked that they should be dry-nursed in Quetta. To some I granted a free 3rd class ticket to Karachi, so that they could there perhaps learn market values for both their wool and also of their requirements in cottons, etc. I suggested to them that it probably was not now necessary for them to go beyond Nushki, To this they did not agree, saying that at Nushki the Hindu brokers were even more unscrupulous than at Quetta. I have written to Quetta reporting their grievances and have no doubt that the Seistani trader will find himself more hospitably received this year. In the struggle for trade from Birjand and Seistan it is as well that Quetta should bear a better name, though at present the Baluch trader knows no other market.24th October. —Marched to Shereepabad. 26th October, —Arrived at the Seistan Bund across the Helmund. At this time of the year the water in the Helmund is at its lowest, neither being flooded by winter rains, or melting snows. It is at this time, therefore, that the bund is repaired ; in fact at this time of the year and for about two to three months a bund at all can be said to exist. When I visited the bund in June, I reported that the famed bund was in reality no bund at all, as it did not extend across the whole river. This time I learnt that the bund is rebuilt every year in October, and only stands until a freshet of water brought down by winter rains carries it away. The moment any rain fills the Helmund with water, the level is sufficient to irrigate the arable portions of Seistan. A bund which could raise the water several feet would increase the cultivated area of Seistan ten-fold. Though I have never visited Egypt, I cannot help always comparing this country with it. It is a land where little or no rain falls, and which is entirely dependent on the water of the Helmund. The fertility of the soil is beyond question, and would grow a very large crop of cotton besides wheat, but it is limited to the area watered. This area, too, is much contracted, first by the water being taken from the Helmund at the very place it is wanted, instead of being brought from further up the river, and secondly, because the river-bed has been made an artificial border between Afghanistan and Seistan. This river-bed, which can be easily trained one way or another, is dragged to opposite sides, for the purpose of irrigation, and of course constitutes a cause of endless dispute. Unlike the Nile, the Helmund pours the whole of its fertilizing power into the lap of Seistan, for none escapes to the sea. It would he a nice calculation for scientific irrigation to so drain the river that no overflow on Naisar remained. While at the bund I saw lots of fine mahsher fish rising, and only wished I had a rod. The natives were trying to catch them in an impotent way, with small stationary nets. One fine fish of about 25 lbs. was brought into my camp. Certainly in India I could picture no better place for fishing during October. ° ° 27th October. —Ghulam Deh. It was reported to me that Mr. Miller had distributed several Sardaris or coats to Baluch chiefs. Mr. Miller, through one Pasand Khan, whom lie pays well, is very attentive to any Baluch he can secure. Fortunately Pasand Khan commands no respect and has no following among the Baluchis. The fact, though, that he receives a monthly stipend from Mr. Miller, and that Sardar Syed Khan, the Baluch Chief, who guards the interests of our caravans between Itobat and Seistan, and who hns in many ways afforded help to us, receives no pay, is not well spoken of among the people. I have, while addressing village assemblies of Baluchis, been heckled, and asked why he is not paid by us, as Pasand Khan is by the Russians. The question is an awkward one for me. I have already urged the claims that Syed Khan has on us, and the important work he has done for us, and hope it may not be long now before some monthly stipend be given him. Throughout the whole of my tour he accompanied me. His men kept guard every night over the camp, while we were passing along the Afghan border, a very necessary precaution, for thieving on the Persian border is an amusement the Afghan can enjoy with impunity. 28 th October. —Nutak. From here large caravans were starting for Quetta, and to many I gave letters of introduction to the Assistants in Quetta, asking that they might be protected from brokers, for these people all had the same story to tell of Quetta inhospitality and their difficulties there. As I had my Hospital Assistant in camp with me, I had numerous visitors, a great many coming from the Afghan side of the border. 30th October.—Vokok, Here more caravans w r ere leaving for Quetta, and I was able to encourage them much by telling them of good rates in Quetta for wool and ghi. 31st October.— This is always a markedly friendly village. It belongs to Sardar Syed Khan Daroi, at present banished from Seistan. °While here 1 was told that it was rumoured that Sir Naoroz Khan had been offered by the Amir Abdul Rahman land on the left bank of the Helmund, viz., th3 land just above Seistan proper. This land can be easily watered by a canal from the Helmund, and would only be the land which formerly was watered under the name of Seistan of which Houzdor and Kunder lands are cotermin ous. These two deserted towns are within the present Seistan border, but are in ruins owing to their water-supply from the Helmund being in the hands of the Afghans. From here I continued my way down to the Naisar, and returned to Nasratabad on the 6th November. As I approached the Naisar I marched for miles over an absolutely flat fertile plain, land that had been for years under the water of the Ha moon, but which had during recent years been reclaimed owing to the shifting of the Helmund bed. No land could be more productive. For years it has received a wealth of that fertilizing soil which great rivers can bestow. Here I was told there w^as no need even to sow for a harvest: last year’s crop sowed itself, and so the tiller of the soil was spared all labour but the reaping. No one can traverse Seistan, and see its capabilities for production, its many ruined cities and villages, but bemoan its fate. A scientific distribution of its waters and a settled government is all that is required to make it one of the richest producing countries in the world. As to its climate,, so universally abused, I have now passed the whole hot weather here, and judging from the health both of myself and my camp, I think we can all say we have never been better in our lives. There have been no cases of fever in my camp since 1 came. The wind, which prevails for about six months, makes life possible; without it the climate would be stifling and probably unhealthy; with its help rooms can be cooled by passing it through wetted thorns, wdiile, on account of its incessant force, it could be made to work wind-mills and water-mills for the great benefit of the country. Notes from Birjand .—From Birjand I continue to receive very satisfactory reports. The Amir, the Shawkat-ul-Mulk, sends me constant messages of friendship and has done everything he can to help Seth Suleiman’s agent there. The merchants are constantly writing to me for information about the Quetta trade-route. Their difficulty at present is that they cannot easily find out Quetta market rates, etc. I am doing all I can for them. Several hundred camels have started or are on the point of starting for Quetta. Some mer chants are waiting to hear of prices in Quetta, a few are hesitating, because the Russian Agent has spread reports that there is plague in Quetta^ and some are only delayed from w 7 ant of transport. All are anxious to go to Quetta. If I had a good Indian trader at Birjand who could lead the way, they would all follow. Seth Suleiman’s agent is doing all he can, but he is engrossed in his shop. As they have heard about the cotton famine in Lancashire, several hundred camels are bringing cotton from Birjand to Quetta. Birjand is a larger trading centre than Seistan, and at this time of the year and during the summer the British Consul should have his head-quarters there. General 'Remarks .—From the above it will easily be seen that a very large number of camels will this year go to Quetta, many of them on a trial trip, and I am naturally anxious that the traders should be well received, and be fairly treated. This year we have had matters both here and at Birjand our own way, but our success has roused the Russians to some action, and there are many signs that failing to draw the trade towards Askhabad they will begin to place as . many obstructions in the way as possible. Their obstructive policy is worked through the Persian officials to whom they seem to be able to dictate more easily than we do. Some time ago Mr. Miller sent his Mirza to Meshed on the pretence of fetching his family. This man has been doing all he can to point out to the Wall that we, the English, are undermining his power here and that we mean to take Seistan by a coup and such fables. The result has been that stringent orders have come to the Amir that ghi and wheat are absolutely prohibited from leaving the country. The customs subordinates, mere robbers with no definite orders, have been incited to harass the caravans leaving for4 Quetta, and a Persian doctor openly helped by Mr. Miller spreads rumours of plague .in Quetta, and threatens quarantine on returning caravans, etc. Such tactics are of course only to be expected, and it is pleasing to see how very little they are able to affect the caravans now leaving from all parts of Seistan, and making for Robat by different routes. The horses of my escort have lately suffered from glanders, and on this excuse I am sending eight of my escort under a very trusted native officer to Robat for change of air. Their presence on the road will intimidate the Customs officials and I hope assure caravans that no harm will come to them. The escort of course will in no way forcibly interfere, but the Persian fears possible interference; The Amir throughout behaves very well and keeps me informed of all orders that are sent him. About the wheat, he said that he was not aware that any was exported; but said Mr. Miller would always report when it was. The Persian doctor and his quarantine may, I hope, be removed by an order from Tehran, and the Customs officials I am reporting to Mr. Castigne, the Belgian head of the Khorassan Customs in Meshed. Colonel Temple will no doubt bring pressure on him to appoint some respectable man here, now that Seistan has grown so important. It is a pity that the Seistan Customs are not under English supervision. Purport of a letter, dated the 24 th September, from Hadji Mahomed Mohsin, one of the leading traders in Birjand, to Major E. C. Trench. I have received your kind letter and have informed all the traders of its contents. We all agree that the Seistan-Quetta route is for many reasons pre ferable to the Bunder Abbas route, and we all intend for the future sending our camels by the Quetta route. Some Afghans told us that some of the marches were long, and that the water in a few places was bad, but we have learnt from Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali that many improvements have of late taken place. The caravans are bent upon using the Quetta road in future, as on the Bunder Abbas line camels contract all sorts of diseases, and die in large numbers. The climate besides is very bad, which is not the case on the Quetta road, where travelling is very pleasant. I wrote last week to the traders at Herat to send caravans to Birjand for Quetta, in company with others from Kainat. The Herat caravans prefer travelling by out-of-the-way paths to avoid paying customs duties, but now that your wishes are known they are sure to come by the Quetta route. Exd.—J. E. F. G. I. C. P. 0. No. 437 F. D.—7.12-1900.—31Diary No. 18 of Major G. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, for period from 16th November to 30th November 1900. 16th November 1900. —Received a visit from the Mulla of Neh Bandan. He was introduced by one of the Seistani Mullas. He was anxious to lead the way from Neh to Quetta with a caravan. He said that if he went over, one thousand camels from Neh would follow. He came to me to receive some assurances about the road, as he had heard complaints and bad reports of Quetta. I assured him he should receive letters to Sahibs in Quetta, and be given everv help there. Quetta during the winter is a most unsuitable place for the camel, especially the animal from the warm plains of .Seistan, Neh, etc. The cold at Quetta during the winter kills the Seistan camel, while the price of fodder is prohi bitive. When a railway and a telegraph line is accomplished to Robat the trade and traffic, I believe, will be enormous. Traffic by the Nushki camel-route when developed to its fullest extent can never, I believe, be more than a fraction of the traffic which would pass over a railway. 19th November.—X caravan of eighty camels laden with unab (a red nut used as medicine) arrived from Herat, having come by the following route :— Herat, Doshak, Aodaru, Yezdun, Gazik, Tabbas, Duruh, Nasratabad. The men with the caravan reported that there were several hundred more camels coming from Herat, that these few caravans were all trial caravans. It depended on the treatment they received in Quetta, the prices they realized on their mer chandise, etc., whether all the caravans from Herat who usually use the Bunder Abbas route would in future use the Quetta route. A great many caravans have gone this year on trial trips to Quetta. 22nd November. —A second caravan of 100 camels, also a trial caravan, passed through for Quetta from Herat. The caravan men had heard a great deal about the difficulties at Quetta and were, they said, very much afraid of the cold for their camels, but they said they had determined to make the trial this year, and if not successful would continue as before to use the Bunder Abbas road. A scare was started among the camel-men in Seistan that quarantine was to be placed on every one returning from India. Several camel-men engaged by Seth Suleiman refused to take up their contract. The scare was artificially produced by Agents of the Russian Vice-Consul. I visited the Amir, and as usual found him ready to help. He ordered the men, who had agreed to go, to start at once, and told them that quarantine had been prevented. The camel-men on receiving this order made no demur, and have since started. 24th November. —I heard that the Wali of Meshed had approved of the Sartip Mir Mausum going to India to visit an oculist. In conversation with Mr. Miller on the subject of tea, he remarked on the fact that all Russians are prejudiced in favour of tea brought to Russia over land, that such tea commands a very high price, reaching a figure of 7 or 8 roubles per pound. On tasting some tea I had received from Calcutta, he remarked that if such tea could be landed in Russia by the dry route, through Seistan, he thought it would meet with a ready sale and compete with the Chinese imported tea. -' He promised to send samples of my tea to Moscow, Petersburgh, and the Customs officials, for their report, promising to give me a translation of the same. If Indian tea can find its way to Russia by the Seistan overland route, and compete with Chinese overland tea, the Seistan route will have opened a very profitable market to the Indian tea-growers. 25th November. —The Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk very severely beat a leading khatkhuda on the charge that he was plotting with the Sartip Mir Mausum agamst him. There probably was no truth in the rumour, but the Amir was, I think, anxious to show some strength and overawe any waverers who mightbe induced to encourage the Sartip to create differences with his father. The khatkhuda who was beaten happened to be one of the few men in Seistan who was friendly with the Russian Vice-Consul. 30th November.—I received a private visit from the Amir. In previous conversation he has often asked me about the status and rights of Indian Princes. I have always suspected that he did so with a view to future events, but I was surprised to hear him tell me in a 1 ! seriousness that he knev quite well that Seistan could not long remain under Persian rule, and would, he hoped, be a province of India. I replied that the Indian Government had never taken anv part of Persia and had no intention towards Seistan.. In the best of humours he replied, “ You know and I know that it will be English , gi\ing me to understand that he knew where his interests lay. Latei in the couveis- ation he said he was glad he had received the sanction of the V ali of Meshed to the proposed visit of the Sartip to India, he said he didn t at all vant him to uo to Tehran, where there would be intrigues, but was glad for him to have an opportunity of seeing his future masters ! As long, therefore, as the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk and his sons rule in Seistan, there need, I think, be no doubt about the paramount influence which the English will hold in Seistan. G. CHENEVIX-TRENCH, Major, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan*Camp Diary of Lieutenant-Colonel H. M, Temple, Agent to the Gofernor- General of India and Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan and Seistan, dated the 6th November to 5th December 1900. 6 th November 1900 .—'While at Sehdeh I received a visit from the Deputy Governor. He said that there were about 1,000 souls in the place. The fort had fallen into ruins, and the present houses had of late years been built outside the fort. Formerly this valley and village had been much subjected to Turkoman raids, which had ended since the Russian occupation of Trans-Caspia. He had himself witnessed several raids. Wheat, barley, beetroot, turnips, opium, etc., are grown here. There are three karezes. Wool is exported partly to Birjand and partly to Sabzawar. Sugar is imported from Sabzawar. The climate is colder than Birjand. There is a wind-mill and a strong wind blows in the valley in summer. Snow lies deep in winter. Not many caravans came from the south to this village, though several came as far as Birjand. Nothing is manufactured; and neither silk nor cotton is grown. 7th November .—Sixteen miles, Sehdeh to Ghilek. The route crosses the plain and then enters some low hills from which the clustered domes of the village Jafirabad can be seen in the plain. Amongst the hills the village of Kala Haji Mirza Ahmad is passed. Then the route crosses the Gudari Naokhan after which Ghilek is reached. At this place there are about 50 families. It is situated at a great altitude. The cultivation is on terraces on hill sides and there are a few gardens. Supplies are obtainable at this season of the year and the water is good. Cultivation at this and similar villages is extending now that Turkoman raiding has ceased and life and property are more secure. The country is poor and waterless. Doubtless more water could be procured by means of kanats, but the expenditure of capital would be so great as to render any profit on the outlay more than doubtf ul. Ancient kanats which have become filled up are in places being re-excavated as this is cheaper than making new kanats. All over this part of Khorassan the wind in summer is very high, but it decreases in winter. Flocks of sheep and goats are always to be met with. There are more goats than sheep. A tree on the hills is only rarely to be met with. Shrubs about one foot high are generally to be seen and are useful as they constitute almost the only fuel to be found. The people of the Kain province are extremely poor. 7 th November .—Gilek to Birjand, 18 miles. The track rises continuously until the summit of the Gudari Saman Shahi is reached. This pass, which is about 7,000 feet high, has an easy ascent and descent, and is not difficult at the summit. Descending the pass the follow ing villages are passed:—Ziraj, 15 families; Pisute, 20 families; Maiabad, 10 families; Karimabad, 5 families, and Ishkambarabad, 20 families. At some distance from the town I was met by the Deputy Karguzar and Passport Officer, with some sowars. Nearer the town Sartip Ibrahim Khan, with two led horses and a large following, met me, and conducted me to my camp. I was received in a very cordial and satisfactory manner. From the Shaukat-ul-Mulk downwards the people are disposed to regard the British in a very friendly light. Abbas Ali, the Hospital Assistant, is permitted to see the Shaukat-ul-Mulk at any time, while the Russian Agent is but very rarely received. The Agent of Seth Sulaiman has opened a shop here. To encourage him and strengthen his position in the town I visited his shop, taking with me all the sowars and farrashes, so that my visit to his shop might be as conspicuous as possible. He appeared to have done a considerable trade in fancy goods, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk being his best customer. He has also rendered himself very useful in inducing local traders to send their goods to India via the Seistan route. I urged him to establish a shop in Meshed and gave him advice as towhat goods, such as leather-ware, saddlery, tea, cutlery, etc., would be most likely to find a ready sale. 9 th iVWmfor.—Halt at Birjand. Amir.ud-din, the agent of Seth Sulai- man, called and asked me to mention him favourably to the Shaukat-uhMulk as it would help, and I said I would do so accordingly. He said Armenian merchants are coming here, and will bring about twenty-five camel-loads of Russian merchandise, chiefly piece-goods imported to Meshed. There is a certain amount of trade wfith Herat here. He said that he had no trouble with the Customs contractor here. The son of the Deputy Governor of Kain also came; he said that about 200 camel-loads of wool were sent to Bandar Abbas for shipment. This wool will be almost certainly sent via Seistan now that the road is in good order. Some wool is also sent to Sabzawar for export to Russia. Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan, the Postmaster, came to see me. He said that the Postmastership was not a paying occupation, and that he could not take it up unless he engaged in trade. He was thinking of abandoning it and engaging in trade with Quetta, to which place he was thinking of making a journey. I encouraged him as much as possible in this idea, and urged upon him the advisability of starting a shop in Meshed and of acting as a forwarding agent for Persian merchants. Before the Shah left for Europe he sent a proposal to Tehran for the establishment of a post office in Seistan, but received no reply. He hoped that now the Shah is returning an answer will be sent. There js more correspondence here now that the Consulates have been established in geistan. While Amir-ud-din, the Agent of Seth Sulaiman, was here, his shop was robbed by one of the servants of Mirza Muhammad Hussain, the customs contractor, who lives in the same caravanserai. The thief was arrested and imprisoned by the Shaukat-ul-Mulk. About half the property valued at 80 tumans was received. To-day the thief escaped from jail and gave himself up at my camp throwing himself on our mercy. Amir-ud-din said that he had to pay the cost of keeping the prisoner in jail and he asked that he might be released. He also had hopes that the thief would procure the rendition of some of the remaining property. I said that I would speak to the Shaukat- ul-Mulk about it. Mirza Muhammad Husain, the Customs contractor, came to see me. He said that he has paid 7,500 tumans for the contract for Seistan, Kain, Turbat, Turshiz, Sabzawar, Jam, Bakharz, and Khaf. He complained of the Russian quarantine arrangements which he said had discouraged traders and done him much harm. He said that it was the custom of the country to charge 5 per cent, on the value of imported goods, not at the invoice value, but at the rate at which they were sold at the place where the duty was paid. He said he had referred the matter to M. Castaigne, the Director-General. I explained to him that it was to his advantage to give facilities to traders, as, if obstacles were put in their way, trade would decrease. He said he was about to proceed to Seistan to superintend customs arrangements there. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk visited me and I returned his visit. As he has treated Amir-ud-din, the Agent of Seth Sulaiman, and Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali well, I thanked him for it pointedly in their presence, and I have no doubt that he will continue to afford them assistance. He is still suffering from an accidental revolver wound in the hand which was inflicted by a revolver going off while he was fingering it about six months ago. His hand has a serious scar on it, and he cannot use it with comfort. He lives in a small garden house about a mile and a half outside the town where he holds a weekly Darbar. He comes into the town occasionally. The town is now said to have about 30,000 inhabitants crowded together in a small space in huts. The streets are narrow and tortuous. There is no regular bazar, but scattered shops. There is little doubt that most of the export for India from here will now use the Seistan route. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk is an intelligent man, and he seems to obtain a fair idea of the course of current events from Persian news papers. He seems to be very friendly to us. When M. Miller passed through on his way to Seistan he complained to Meshed about the accommodation which had been given him, notwithstanding the presents sent him by the Russian3 Government when Captain Sykes was here. I did not notice anything which tended to show that the Shaukat-ul-Mulk regarded the Russians in a specially favourable light. They sent him a silver tea set with a silver samawar. This was a mistake, because it is contrary to their religion to drink out of silver vessels and the present was useless. The very religious will not even smoke out of a silver kalyan. I mentioned to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk the case of the thief who had taken refuge in my tent and he said that he would deport him from Birjand. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk keeps up some troops, some of them Tvere in uniform when I visited him. He said that they did not know much about drill, but that they were good shots. 11th November .—Halt at Birjand. I visited the Sartip, Mir Ibrahim Khan. He lives in a garden about T| miles from the town. He is a pleasant, young man, but has nothing to do with the government of the district. However, I impressed on him, as well as on everyone else, the advantages of the Seistan route. He occupies the old house in which his father, the late Amir of Kain, lived. I also visited the Deputy Karguzar, who also holds the post of passport official. He said that he had assisted Amir-ud-din, who had at one time been troubled by the customs contractor. He said that he was always willing to give any assistance that he could. This contractor had given annoyance to Afghan traders, but the JSaib Karguzar had prevented him. He said that he quite appreciated the advantages of the Seistan route, and that he would do what he could to support it. I also visited the Postmaster. He said that a great improvement would follow if the land in Seistan which now belongs to the Persian Government were sold to cultivators. He said that the Russians had an impossible idea of trying to persuade the Persian Government to grant them the lease of Seistan and that he had reported to that effect to the Persian Government. He said that the town of Birjand contained about 5,000 houses and about 25,000 indivi* duals. It is watered by only one karez and the supply is very valuable. The Mustaufi came to visit me. I pressed on him the advantages of the Seistan route. He said that he was sending some camels to Quetta vid Seistan through Amir-ud-din, with goods for sale and to bring a return load. He has much influence in Birjand and with the Shuakat-ul-Mulk, and most of the business of the place is done either through or by him. There is no doubt that he will support the Seistan route and is well aware that much advantage will accrue to Kain by the opening of this route to trade. 12th November .—Birjand to Sir-i-Chah, 2T miles. Before starting I returned the visit of the Mustafi. Amir-ud-din was present and I am glad to say that he is on excellent terms with him. The route crosses the plain, the first village met with is Marak, with about twenty families, 12 miles from Birjand. The next village amongst low hills is Ranishk with about twenty families. After passing the Gudar-i-Rogh, Sir-i-Chah is reached. This place has a ruined fort and about eighty families. It is situated higher than Birjand and is much colder. The people of Sir-i-Shah are mostly traders, many are Babis. There is a good deal of cultivated ground which grows turnips and beetroot. 13th November .—About 18 miles, Sir-i-Cbah to Duruksh. The route passes through low hills and crosses the Gudar-i-Pakhrud to the village of Eakhrud, about the 6th mile. A short distance further on the Gudar-i-Purkhas is crossed, beyond which the village of Purkhas lies (about 50 families). To the south lies the village of Pazlabad. Bezun is the next village with about 20 families, beyond which lies Duruksh. Here there is a Deputy Governor of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s. He visited me, and I returned his visit. There are three villages close together which contain about 2,000 inhabitants. I impressed on him the advantages of the Seistan route. There are a great number of looms employed in making carpets at this place. The manufacture is of ancient date. Duruksh is at high elevation and is cold at4 this season. A good deal of rain fell during the day. There is not much cultivation. 14th Aoe:m5(?r.—Halt at Duruksh. There are about 80 factories containing about 120 looms at Duruksh, The old designs, which were very good and thoroughly Persian, are being changed by Turk merchants, who order rugs and carpets of Russian, Turkish, and other designs mostly bad, and still worse in colour. The industry is being seriously damaged from an artistic point of view. There is a much readier and quicker sale than there was formerly, the work now done is mostly very coarse and rough in comparison with the carpets previously woven which were very fine and^contained work of far higher quality. No carpets are being sent at present to India, they are all taken to Russian or Turkish territory. The Governor of Duruksh belongs to the same family as the Shaukat*ul-Mulk. 15th November, —Duruksh to Zahan, about 22 miles. The route passes amongst hills the whole way. At about the 5th mile the villages of Upper and Lower Bulander are reached. The upper has about 30 families and the lower about 10 families. At about the 8th mile the Gudari Khang is crossed, after which the Dusht-i-Shikoh is reached. At about the 12th mile is the Gudari-i-Shikoh. At the 16th mile lies the small village of Baimurgh with about 15 families. The gardens of the village of Zahan commence at about the 20th mile. This village is in a narrow valley with a fair supply of water, and has about 200 families. Woollen socks and gloves are made in considerable quantities here. 16th November. —Zahan to Isfidin, about 18 miles. The road passes through the narrow valley in which Zahan lies which opens out on to a plain on which stands the village of Panjao with about 110 families. After passing over this plain a gorge is entered, down which the route winds. After crossing the Gudar-i-Afi, the village of Afi (about 60 houses) about 10 miles from Zahan is reached. It contains a large number of barberry trees, the produce of which is taken to Meshed and other parts of Persia. After leaving the gorge the village of Khatibi is reached. It contains about 15 families and is the private property of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Thence to Isfidin, the plain is wide and open. Isfidin has about 300 families and a number of gardens. A Deputy Governor resides here. The chief products of the place are cotton and wheat. 17th November. —Isfidin to Garamah, 18 miles. In the morning it rained heavily. The route leads across the plain to low hills. Owing to the rain the land under the hills was heavy mud and would be impossible to cross after a whole day’s rain. The route crosses the hills by the Gudar-i-Gilkan and the Gudar-i-Aghol-Ghazi after which it reaches by a gentle descent the little village of Garmah. Muhammad Siddik Khan, a relative of a former Governor of Khaf, has come to live here. His cousin Mir Nasrullah Khan was once Governor of Khaf, but has fled to Herat, There is a hot spring here said to have medicinal qualities. The village has about 10 families. The black tents of the Bahluli nomads are to be found in places. 18th November. —Garamah to Buniabad, about 18 miles. I received a visit from Muhammad Siddik Khan, a well educated man. He said that saffron was now being grown at Garmah for the first time. As regards Khaf, he said that the people were dissatisfied owing to the oppressive rule of the son of the Rukn-ud-Dowleh. Also that Mir Nasrullah Khan was not likely to come back from Herat. He also said that the Baluchis considered themselves to be superior to the Bahlulis and would not intermarry with them. The Shah Az Kuh mountain which overlooks the Zirikoh plain appears to he much higher above the surrounding country on this side. The route lies amongst low hills the whole way until the Zirikoh plain is reached. Tak wood shrubs are plentiful on the way. There is no cultivation and what water there is is brackish. Buniabad has about 15 families. There are Balu chis and Bahlulis in the neighbourhood. 19th November. —Buniabad to Ibrahimi, about 14 miles.5 There is no cultivation on the route which passes over an open plain. It rained nearly all day. Ibrahimi contains about 50 families. 20th November. —Ibrahimi to Nashtifan, about 20 miles. The route passes over an open plain on which some ruined villages are to be seen. There is no cultivation. There are several filled up Itanats. Leaving this plain the route passes over a rising ground on which there is a little cul tivation at Bushrabad. Nashtifan has a large number of pine trees, used to break the wind which comes with great force. The town contains about 300 houses and 22 wind-mills. The wind was both very high and cold. 21st November. —Nashtifan to Khaf, about 10 miles. The following villages were passed :—Mirabad, about 30 families; Tizab, 20 families, and Khargird, about 30 families. Bui (Khaf) contains about 1,000 houses, and a small bazar. There are some Hindus here from Shikarpur engaged in money lending. The Governor of Khaf, the Mumtaz- ud-Dowleh, son of the Rukn-ud-Dowleh, the Governor-General, sent a recep tion party to meet me, with two led horses and a number of sowars. 22nd November. —Halt at Rui. The Governor came to visit me, and I returned his visit. I found him to be extremely friendly. The Russians have a quarantine post at the village of Bahrabad, about 12 miles away. The Governor said that nothing had been heard of cholera nearer than Kandahar, or of plague, but that neverthless this quarantine post had been kept up for about four years. He had strong suspicions as to why this quarantine line had been established and kept up. He had heard that a Russian traveller, who called himself a naturalist, was travel ling from Meshed to Seistan. The Persian Passport Officer came also to call on me. lie was on his way to Seistan. 23rd November .—Khaf to Karat, about 24 miles. The Governor’s son drove me part of the way in his carriage. He seemed impressed with the cheapness and excellence of English goods. The route passes over a plain until the hills are reached which are crossed by the Dahana-i- Karat. I was here met by Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, the nephew and son- in-law of the Shuja-ul-Mulk, Governor of Bakharz, with some sowars. They escorted me to Karat, down a path called the Gulu-i-Shutur. On this day also the wind was very high and cold. Karat has about thirty families. It has. a minar and a ruined caravansarai. There is a Russian quarantine post here with five Persian Hazara sowars. Muhammad Ibrahim Khan told me that one of the men at each post can read and write and has to send in a monthly report about the caravans which pass through each post. . The sowars have to patrol +he line. These men are supplied by his uncle, but it was not known what the 0 bject of patrol was. The Mirza at each post gets 8j tumans and the sowars 7^ tumans a month each. At this place snow fell. 24th November. —Karat to Karez, about 24 miles. Muhammad Ibrahim Khan came and called in the morning and rode out part of the way with me, with some sowars. He is a pleasant, young man and disposed to be very friendly. The route crosses over the Hashtadan plain until some low hills are reached crossed by the Dahana-i-Kulf, from which the villages of Parmanabad and Taiabad can be seen. Descending these hills a large reception party came out to meet me. They were headed by Muhammad Ali Beg, the uncle of the Deputy Governor of Taiabad, also Muhammad Jan Khan Sultan, the Deputy Governor of Karez. Altogether there were about one hundred sowars and we rode into Taiabad a large party. Parmanabad has a ruined fort and about fifty families. The Russians have a post at this place.of five sowars. Taiabad has a ruined mausoleum and a mosque and contains about six hundred families After leaving this place the greater part of the reception party went to Paizabad, where the Governor of Bakharz is living. The route continues through some low mounds until Karez is reached. 25th November. —Halt at Karez. There are about 150 families at Karez. It has an old ruined fort and a ruined mausoleum. There is a small caravansarai. The Russians have a doctor and a military officer (Soudnik) at this place, with ten Russian Cossacks, 753 F. D.6 besides two infantry soldier servants of the Russian officers and two com pounders and also two Turk intrepreters. There are no Russian traders. The Persian doctor who was sent here to proceed to Herat has returned to Meshed. He got no further than the Persian frontier. At the present season there is little trade passing through Karez owing to the winter. It increases in the spring and continues through the summer. Wool and opium are chiefly brought from Herat for Turat-i-Haidari. 26th November .—Halt at Karez. I went to call on the Russian doctor and the Sub-Lieutenant in charge of the Cossacks. The former has been here several months and is longing to be sent back to Ashkabad. A halt here was necessary to allow the ground to dry after heavy rain. 27th November .—The Shuja-ul-Mulk, chief of Hazaras in Khorassan, and the present Governor of Bakharz, came to call on me. He seemed much depressed at the present weak position of the Persian Government. He seemed to think that much might have been done, but that the time had now passed. I tried to uncourage him pointing out the great achievements of Nadir Shah who had materials of a similar nature to work with as exist now. With regard to the quarantine, he said that the Russians had no business at Karez and that, in his opinion, the quarantine was only an excuse to veil political designs. He said that plague had never been anywhere near this part of Persia and that cholera at Kandahar and Kabul was very distant. I received a visit from Sarhang Muhammad Agha, an officer belonging to the Persian Cossack Brigade in Tehran, at present on duty with the Ptussians at Karez. 28th November. —I returned the visit of the ShujVul-Mulk. With respect to the visit of Shah to Europe he said that there was no necessity for it, and that it would have been better if he had remained in Tehran to set his own affairs in order, as they were in a bad state. He regarded the loan raised by the Shah from the Russians as a very unfortunate affair. With regard to the Persian army he said that the men were neither properly fed nor clothed, and that these were the chief reasons why they were disorganised. I also returned the visit of the Sarhang Muhammad Agha. He is a native of TJrumia, and an officer of pleasing address. 29th November .—Karez to Abbasabad, about 16 miles. The route passes over an open plain the whole way. The little village of Sardah (20 families) lies on the west. The fort of Muhsinabad is passed. It contains two guns.. The nominal garrison consists of 12 gunners and 200 infantry, but the garrison present consists of one gunner and about 50 infantry as the rest are very irregularly paid if at all, and they are usually absent earning their living. This part of the route is now becoming populated. The village of Sardah has sprung up within the last year. Abbasabad has only just become repopulated. There are the remains of two ancient villages at this place. Cultivation has again after a lapse of many years recommenoed at this place* The village was destroyed by the Turkomans. Raids have ceased for more than twenty years and cultivators are now beginning to return. They have opened a disused kanat, and a considerable stretch of land is now under cultivation. 30th November .—Abbasabad to Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam, about 16 miles. The route is over an open plain. The village of Kulud with about 50 families is passed. Some of our postal sowars were formerly at this place but the post has been abolished. The large village of Yakutainlies near Turbat. The Deputy Governor, Din Muhammad Khan, came out with a number of sowars to receive me. Zain-ul-Abidin Khan, the Deputy of the Saharmul- Mulk, and the Muntasir-ul-Mulk came out to meet me as far as Abbasabad. The Passport official also came out to meet me, altogether there was a body of seventy or eighty sowars, as I rode into Turbat-i Sheikh Jam. As everywhere else my reception was most cordial. At this place there is a great Aiwan splendidly decorated with tiling of the time of Sultan Sanjar. It is a place of pi gnmage and in a fair state of repair. Behind it is a very old mosque with some remarkably fine work in “ gatch ” plaster. The village is in a prosperous7 condition and contains about 300 families. There is an abundance of water especially after rain. There are about twenty shops here and several gardens. 1 st December. —Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam to Langar, about 16 miles. The route leads along the valley past some small villages. Cultivation has increased of late years everywhere. Langar has about four hundred families with a wide stretch of cultivation chiefly on water from the Jam river. There is a large village called Mabmudabad close to Langar containing about 300 houses. The Malik-ut-Tujjar of Tehran has an agent here who came to see me. He said that the Maiik-ut-Tujjar had bought land in the vicinity from the Itukn-ud-Dowleh about six years ago. The first year it produced only about 500 kharwars, but that it now produced about 1,500 kharwars, as the income had been spent on kanats and improving the land. The Malik-ut-Tujjar bought Langar from the Shaham-ul-Mulk. The former is partly under Russian protection. He owns a great deal of land in Kborassan which increases in value as the export to Russia and Ashkabad of produce is now permanent and increasing. 2 nd December. —Langar to Karez-i-Nau, about 16 miles. Fresh cultivation is springing up along the route. This is specially noticeable at Khairabad, which has some large extent of cultivation belonging to the Malik-ut-Tujjar of Tehran. Khairabad contains about two hundred families. The export of the surplus produce grown is entirely in the direc tion of Meshed. The agent of Malik-ut-Tujjar offered me a house at Khaira bad near Karez-i-Nau. The offer was hospitable and well-meant, but as it was not convenient I did not avail myself of it. 3rd December. —Karez-i-Nau to Fariman, about 28 miles. The road passes over an open plain past the village of Kata Shamshir. There is much cultivated land. At this early date all the hills towards the east were covered with snow. The western border of the plain is much lower and the hills wdiich are not so high had no snow. Fariman has about 300 families and a large supply of water from a hill stream. The cultivation belongs to the jMuawin-ut-Tujjar, the Afghan banker at Meshed. The village was granted by the Shah to his physician, Hakim-ul-Mulk, who leased it to the banker. The latter offered me his house and as the w r eather was very damp and cold, I was glad of it. The offer which w ? as entirely unexpected displayed the good feeling and hospitality of these people. The banker was himself away from Fariman. dth December. —Fariman to Bakirabad, about 20 miles. The road crosses an open plain and thence passes through some low hills which were formerly the scene of Turkoman raids and were famous for robberies. Leaving them the route passes the village of Husainabad w r ith about twenty families of Barharis. The next village Sadabad bas about forty families and a caravansarai. There is a good deal of cultivation here. The village of Bakirabad is then reached. It has about fifty families and a new caravansarai is being built by a Yezdi merchant, Haji Husain of Meshed. All these places are flourishing as Turkoman raiejs have ceased for the last twenty years or more and the trade between Herat and Meshed is flourishing. 5th December. —Bakirabad to Meshed, about 2&amp; miles. The route passes over open country. Four days before I passed two men from Meshed were murdered at the Tapu-i-Salam, where the first view of Meshed is obtained on this route. One was buried, but the other was lying at a few yards from the public route when I passed. Passers-by had been afraid to report the case to the authorities for fear that they would be either accused or otherwise molested on the matter being”reported to the Governor-GeneraPs servants. They said that His His Highness was ill with fever, and that no report had reached him, but that enquiries would be made at once. H. M. TEMPLE, Dieutenant-Colonel, Agent to the Governor~ General of India and Meshed; ^ Her Dritannic Majesty’s Consul-General The 5th December 1900. ) for Khorassan and Seistan. G. I. C. p. o.—No. 753 F. D.—18-1-01.—60 —B. M.fU.fl ^ Diary/of Major G. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, A Seistan, for period from 1st December to 15th December- The past fortnight has been one of great encouragement. It has been made evident to me that British influence is thought to be paramount in Seistan, and that this influence is very popular among all classes. My orders were to uphold British prestige, cultivate friendly relations with the people, and en courage trade. All this I can fairly say has been done. The officials of Seistan headed by the Amir have supported me throughout my stay here. The Amir’s open and pronounced friendliness has been remarked on in previous diaries. At a Darbar held by him to celebrate the safe return of the Shah, 1 was received with every mark of attention. The Russian Vice-Consul in full uni form hurried down to the majHs with the intention of securing the foremost place, or hoping that the reading of the Shah’s proclamation and other formalities would be gone through prior to my arrival. The Amir, however, kept the wajlis sitting for half an hour, the Russian Consul included, pending my arrival. I was late, as 1 had not bten told the hour of the majlis or Darbar. Arriving last with some state and in uniform I made myself, through the Amir’s action, the most important person of the Darbar. The Amir, who received me at a greater distance from his seat than he had done the Russian Consul, conducted me to his own seat in the centre, thereby cleverly placing the Russian Consul, who had secured the right-hand seat, below me. After my arrival all the formalities connected with the reading of the Shah’s proclamation were gone through. Mr. Miller has, on occasions, tried to suppose himself the senior Consul, as he arrived here first, hut the action of the Amir at the Darbar showed everyone clearly what he thought. I paid a visit to the head Mujtahid of Seistan. Though now infirm, he is still able to sway public opinion to a great extent. His conversation was remarkable. He enlarged on the change that had come over the Seistanis since the arrival of the English, he deplored the backward condition of his country, but he congratulated his country on its proximity to the Indian frontier and English influence. The railway, said he, to Robat was promised within a year, and yet there is no work being done on it. Though an old man, he said, he would be the first to make use of it, and that it was his ambition to see it accom plished before he died. I said this to the Russian, said he, significantly. It is correct he did do so to Hr. Miller’s friend in the hearing of my Munshi. He said, all your buildings and your road you have made to the Amir’s Ark are very pleasing to me. It is a good work for the people, and has its reward from above. Continue, he said, to make my country prosper. The English are just, and God, therefore, prospers them. When first the English came here, he said, we were anxious about the effect it would have on our religion, and about the moral conduct of so large an influx of men. After seven months we know that the conduct of the English colony is good, that their settlement among us has brought us nothing but good. All people, he said, tell me of the kindness of the Sahib. This conversation was within the hearing of other mullahs and servants. I replied that when I first came I feared lest my actions should be misunderstood, now I only feared lest my Government should fail to realize the great desire there was in Seistan for advancement, and a closer intercourse with India. Both the Surhang and the Sartip, the two sons of the Amir, have very friendly relations with me. The Surhang, who has not the influence or intelli gence of his brother, the Sartip, still shows a keenness to acquire knowledge, and to improve his own surroundings, etc. He prides himself on having learnt a few Hindustani sentences, and has rebuilt his house and laid out a garden since my arrival, besides spending considerable money on furniture, etc., from India. He enjoys attending my weekly gymkhanas which have been kept up regularly since \ came. About 150 to 200 people are always present, and enjoy the one occasion in Seistan for a general meeting. Mr. Miller is a regular attendant2 and has his tea in the Shamiana with me. The Sartip unfortunately cannot attend the gymkhanas. The calling question is still at a dead-lock, he there fore cannofmeet the Russian Vice-Consul. At present the Sartip has only one idea, that is to go to India and consult an oculist. Every post I hope to receive an intimation from His Excellency the Viceroy that the Sartip’s proposed visit to Calcutta is approved of. The Amir having obtained the permission of the Persian Government for his son to go to Indians now busy making preparations, gathering presents for his son to take and arranging to send money to India for his expenses. I have told him that I await orders from India, but he has replied that the road is open, and that his son is free to visit an oculist in India ! He has on another occasion remarked that is well the future ruler of Seistan should acquaint himself with the English. I cannot now much further delay his departure, so will have to let him start in about fifteen days for Quetta. Were I to point out to the Amir that the Sartip’s visit to India had political significance, I should be playing into Mr. Miller’s hand. He would be only too glad to see the Sartip’s visit to India prevented, and has of course been busy in trying to frighten the Persians upon possible results of such a step. Nothing, however, deter the Sartip, who is quite determined to go soon. The people of Seistan are more than friendly. Regular work, regular wases, a knowledge on my part of their language, have had the usual result with the lower orders of Oriental races. The Seistani forms no exception. He mixes freely with my servants, and always has a salaam alailcnm to greet you with whenever he meets you. Everywhere I meet with the same respect. If it is asked what remains for Russian influence, I can candidly say nothing. Mr. Miller’s small establishment here seems to make no mark. His servants and establishment are Persians more interested in personal intrigues, than currying favour with the Seistanis. Mr. Miller himself, though pleasant to everyone, is not in touch with them. He is seldom seen out of his house, and admits to me that he is very dull, without interests, and without subjects. In conversation I asked him how the Russians worked with Customs authorities at Tabriz. He said the Russians are predominant there, and they have come to an understanding. I said here, where we are predominant, the same arrange ments would apply. He fully admits our predominance here, remarking one day that at Meshed I should feel what it was to be too far away from my frontier ! as he did here. I have lately gone to the expense of Rs. 25, and have made a good driving road with bridges from my house to the Amir’s house. I saw he had two carriages which he was unable to use owing to there being no roads. So I chanced the work pleasing him even though it ran through part of the city. The effect has been wonderful, it has been taken by everyone as the highest compliment I could have paid to the Amir and to the people, who benefit by it. As the old Mujtahid said your name will always remain here from the road alone. Before the road, which is only about J a mile long has been used, it has had the effect of making the Surhang make one through the city from his house to the Ark. I am therefore expecting to help the Amir to make a lot of unmetalled roads about his country. During the last fortnight the Jemadar of my escort, Shahzada Ahmed Mir, with eight sowars, went to Kobat. My object was to test the new arrange ments I have made, before the arrival of visitors. I have during my stay here found the Shahzada both from his position and from being an Afghan of great use. On this occasion he realigned a portion of the road, and arranged for the complete bridging of all the canals, except one, the main canal to Seistan, which is too wide. He reports that to travel through Seistan is like travelling in his own country. Everywhere the villagers were ready to help to build bridges and even acknowledged their responsibility to maintain them. Along the whole distance from here to Robat are wells and rest-houses at moderate distances. A Seistani Baluch, under Sardar Syed Khan, arranges to keep each post supplied with bhusa and barley. The post at Girdi is a fortified Thana, with the head-quarters of the postal sowars, and a shop-keeper. The Amir knows about the erection of these buildings, and takes the view that improvements in his country are complL3 mentary presents to him, and link him more to India. A direction he views with more favouahle glances than he does towards Tehran. The Amir has suggested to me that much land now lying uncultivated between this and Robat could be made productive, were it possible to arrange with the Afghans to dig a canal from the Helmund river in a southerly direc tion. As the Helmund above the bund-i-Seistan or Kohak is entirely in Afghanistan, it would be necessary to arrange with the Afghans to bring the canal to the Persian border watering their uncultivated portion first, and allowing the water to flow on into Persian territory. He suggested that the kind offices of the British Government might be asked for to move the Afghans. I said it would be impossible to guess what view the Amir of Kabul would take of the suggestion, but that it was possible for me to make the suggestion to my Government. Later I saw the local Karguzar in whose province such matters are. I said that it would be necessary that the A mir wrote to me on the subject, and put his views clearly on paper. The Karguzar agreed and said he would ask the Amir to address him on the subject, and he wmuld forward the request to me for the favour of attention from the British Govern ment. Trade prospects I consider good. I am not able to keep any record of the camels going to Quetta, but I am aware of many caravans going this year which have not usually used the route. Later on statistics will show any increase there may be. I have frequently called attention to the inhospitality of Quetta, and the want of help there is to the Persian novice who arrives there after having been enticed and urged by me from here. I hear that a caravanserai is now about to be built in Quetta. This will help considerably in attracting caravans to Quetta. It is unfortunate that during the trading season most of the Quetta officials are absent at Sibi. It appears to be no one’s business to dry nurse the Persian trader who has ventured by a new route to a strange country. Bad reports about Quetta are hard to eradicate here. It has been answered to me that Persian reports about dishonest brokers and general discomfort are exaggerated. This may be, but they are believed by the very men whom we wish to induce to go to Quetta. During Captain Webb-Ware’s absence on leave the greatest help has been afforded to the Seistani traders by Mr. Buller Hughes. As first Assistant he has probably less time to spare than any other official, yet he has found time to render the greatest assistance. We are much indebted to him. The establishment of Seth Suleiman here has been of great help to me. The large profits which he will, I hope, make, and the Government patronage he has received is sure to act as a good advertisement, and bring others in his wake. The planting of Indian merchants throughout Persia is, I believe, our best way of securing a trade ascendancy and of increasing our influence. Persian trade with conterminous countries is one of barter. Caravans leave Persia carrying Persian products, and return with their requirements in exchange. I have tried to reverse this, and to induce Indian merchants to send caravans to Persia with tea, indigo, and cotton stuffs, bringing away Persian products in exchange. My efforts at present have not been successful. Indian firms have replied that they would prefer Persian traders to come to them, or else have suggested that I should have respectable and trustworthy Persian firms with whom they could deal. To induce the Persians to visit India is not easy, and to name respectable Persian firms is beyond the scope of my power. Indian merchants established in Persia would act as agents for Indian and English manufacturers, or could be named by me as respectable firms with whom Indian and English manufacturers could deal. From Birjand I have promising accounts of trade prospects. After I have visited Birjand on my way to Meshed, I hope that Birjand will show as preponderating a British influence as Seistan at present enjoys. G. CHENEVIX-TRENCH, Major, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan. G I. C. P. 0.-No.771 F. D.—19-1-1901-31.-B. M.Camp Diary of Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Temple, Agent to the Governor- General of India and Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan and Seistan, dated the 1st to 6th November 1900. 1st November ^0(9.—Suleimani—or Salayuni—to Kain; about 20 miles. The route continues along the plain,'until the village of Asadabad is reached with about 40 families. A short distance further on Taizabad, with 30 families, lies on the route. Immediately on reaching the end of the plain a low range of hills is crossed by the Gudar-i-Gharkab, and the descent to Kain commences. A stream containing at this season of the year a little brackish water is crossed three or four times. On leaving the hills, the plain of Kain is reached. The town stands close to a range of hills. At a short distance from the town I was met by the Deputy Governor with a following of sowars. He said that Kain now contained about 5,000 souls. The chief building is a large mosque which is now partially ruined. The town is surrounded by a wall in fair repair. The chief articles produced are opium, cotton, wool and saffron, which are exported to Bunder Abbas and Meshed. The Deputy Governor was most friendly. 2nd November 1900. —Paid a visit to the Naib of the Shankat-ul-Mulk. When not engaged in Government business he employs his time in trading. He has been in Kain for forty years. He said he intended to send forty or fifty camels laden with goods to Seistan for export to India. Pormerly he used to send his camels to]Bunder Abbas. The camels would carry wool, sadron, cummin seed and silk, etc. Tea, indigo, long cloth and spices, he said, came from Bunder Abbas; while sugar, Turkeyreds and kerosine oil came from Bussia via Sabzawar. Kain grows about 100,000 miskals (6j miskals = 1 ounce) of saffron yearly. He also said that a large number of camels would leave Birjand for Quetta shortly on the responsibility of Seth Suleiman. Sardar Khan, Jahan Khan, and Sardar Said Khan had been turned out of Seistan by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and would be, he said, probably supported by the Shankat-ul-Mulk. * The town of Kain has improved in the last few years and is still improving. It had been laid waste for many years in succession by the Turkomans, who carried off both property and people. Kain had once bpen a very large place but has dwindled. Kain contains about five hundred Saiyids and a college for religious students. 3rd November 1900. —Kain is dominated by an old fort. The local tra dition is that it was occupied by a Jamshid, an ancient Chief of Kain. It is a steep hill, the top of which was rendered more difficult of access by fortifi cations. The walls are now complete ruins, but it once comprised seven forts. Prom the top there is an extensive view of the surrounding country. Near it there is another fort called Kala-i-Dukhtar, on the summit of another hill. The revenue of this valley is about 3,500 tumans a year. The Shankat-ul-Mulk pays, it is said, 2,000 tumans to the Bukn-ud-Dowleh as a yearly present for the retention of the Governorship. It is said here that most of the leading followers of the late Amir are with the Shankat-ul-Mulk, that he always pays his revenue regularly and that his affairs are in good order. Saffron is more extensively grown here than anywhere else in Khorasan. 4th November 1900. —Halt at Kain. 5th November 1900. —Left Kain for Bum; 20 miles. The Deputy Governor rode out with me for some distance. The route crosses the plain and then enters a mass of hills, amongst which lie the villages of Bedmishk (10 families), Ghurwaj (20 families) and Khunik (15 families) ; the route then steadily rises until the summit of the Gudar-i-Khunik is reached. Descending on the other side the first cultivation is Tan gal Tor, where there are no houses, the route descends amongst hills until Bum (about 100 houses) is reached. There is good water and cultivation at this place.2 * 6 th November 1900 .—Rum to Sehdek about 10 miles. The road enters the hills immediately after starting and continues amongst them the whole way. The Gudar i-Kangar is.crossed. Sehdeh has about 200 families, and a robat for Jcafilas. It is situated in a broad plain with scattered cultivation. Colonel Yate had difficulty in obtaining supplies on this route. I, however, found them at this time of year plentiful. H. M.

Enclosed I send you copies of letters I have addressed to various trading centres and manufacturers. The letter to the Chamber of Commerce, Bombay, has also been sent to the Chamber of Commerce at Karachi. The large traders have just begun to turn their attention towards the new road. Unfortunately these large traders do not live in Seistan, but in Birjand. So our new route, and my being here, has taken longer to dawn on them than if they had been under my eye here. I hope very much that when I receive the samples in the form I have asked, the merchants will find the new route not only convenient but profitatble. It is this latter point which will be the chief test. I was obliged to say I would pay any cost, as my experience is that our schemes may be futile unless the cost is guaranteed. To correspond on the question means postponing the information which is an absolute necessity to the traders, until the trading season is over, which would be a great disappointment to me. In case any small sum is expended on getting these samples, I hope the Government will see me through. If the Chamber of Commerce,' and the traders don’t pay expenses as I have hinted, l will make an official application for the money spent. In any case it wowld be ruinous. Duller Hughes wrote that the kind of thing I have written would be useful for circulation, and I would be glad if you had a printed circular for distribution made in the Foreign^which would be supplied to traders making inquiries. The printed circular might be a compilation of all the letters sent herewith, I attach great importance to my method of labelling each sample. Later on I will send to the Chambers of Commerce a letter telling them of the exports available from Seistan and Birjand, and will send them samples with local prices, and similarly labelled to those I require. I understand that the Trade Intelligence Bureau in London have been making inquiries about the new route. If you are writing to them, please say that later I shall be able to give them every information possible about the imports and exports. In the meanwhile I would suggest that they be asked to collect for me samples of all English woollen goods, and flannels, for which there is, I know, a demand in Meshed, together with any other samples of articles they may think likely to be of use in Persia, among a people fond of luxuries. If they will send these samples labelled as I have asked from the Bombay Chamber of Commerce I will make a show-room at Meshed, and obtain as many orders as possible. The information on their labels must, however, be somewhat different to that on the labels from Bombay. They must send their samples first, not to me direct, but to their special agents in Bombay or Karachi, who will when labelling each sample name themselves on the sample label as the agents from whom the goods can be bought, and to whom money must be paid. These agents must themselves fill in, on the labels, the requirements I have asked for from the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and must themselves see that all information is given in Persian. If this is really well done and the samples duly labelled reach me, l shall be able not only to show traders our samples, but also to quote price to his door, and the direct route or method he can have for buying from the manufacturers in England.No. 126, dated Seistan via Quetta, Baluchistan, the 10th September igoo. From—MAJOR G. Chenevix-TkenCH, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul forSeistan^ To—The Manager, Rosa Sugar Works, Rosa, North-Western Provinces. I think Seth Suleiman has already written to you for Indian sugar for the Persian markets. I have now been approached by the wholesale dealers of sugar in Persia and asked to supply samples and prices of sugar delivered at Quetta. I therefore request you will send me samples of loaf sugar and candied sugar. The samples should be very small, about four samples of each sort of sugar. Attached to each sample should be a label on strong paper with the follow ing information written in English and Persian 1 st .—Name of sugar. 2 nd .—Lowest cost per maund delivered at Quetta. 3 rd .—Name and address of person or manufacturers willing to supply at the rate quoted. 4 th .—Name of bankers to whom drafts should be made payable at the time of ordering sugar. No other sugar samples are required. Early compliance with this request is requested. Samples should be neatly done up in small boxes of tin or wood.

As you are aware I am much interested in the trade with Persia by the new route vid Quetta and Nushki. I need not remind you that the tea demand in Persia is very great and should increase. It is hoped that the new route to Persia by Quetta and Nushki will afford a better road of ingress with Persia than any other. Merchants have now asked me to provide them with information regard ing cost of tea delivered at Quetta and I would request that you make the con tents of this letter as widely known as possible in order to ensure my obtaining as many samples of tea with details of cost. I would like to receive small samples of all qualities of black and green tea. Attached to the sample boxes must be a paper giving— (1) Name of sample as known to the trade. (2) Cost of sampled tea packed for camel transport delivered at Quetta per maund. (3) Name of firms or agents willing to supply at prices quoted. (4) Name of bankers to whom drafts should be made payable at the time of ordering. As the carrying power of the post is not great the samples should be small and packed in boxes of tin or wood; at least two samples of each quality should be sent. Should you receive any requests for information about trade in any particular line with Persia I should be glad if you would ask the applicant to send a sample duly labelled in the form requested to the Consul at Seistan, who will be able at the time of giving information to send an order for the goods sampled. 23 No, 128, dated Nasratabad, the 10th September 1900.

It is hoped that the new Nushki route to Persia^ Quetta will be the easiest ingress into Persia for all imports. The exact cost of articles brought by this route is necessary to know. The large traders of this country now desire me to obtain quotations and samples of candles from you. I shall be obliged, therefore, if you will send me neatly packed in boxes of tin or wood samples of your candles 4s., 6 s. and 8s. of every quality. Attached to each sample there should be a strong label with the following information written in English and Persian 1 st .—Name or description of sample. 2 nd .'—Lowest cost per gross, box or maund landed packed for camel transport at Quetta. 3 rd .—Name and address of person or manufacturer willing to supply the articles and samples. —Name of bankers to whom drafts should be made payable at the time of ordering. An early compliance is requested. No, 129, dated Seistan via Quetta, the 10th September 1900. From— -Major G. CHENEVix-TRENCH,Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, Quetta (not Pers a), To—The Bengal Chamber of Commerce. Independently of your letter No. 794 of 1900, I have already addressed a letter to you on the subject of the tea trade with Persia, and have asked you for samples of green and black tea, the samples being separately labelled, with price and description of tea, etc., on each label. From my position here in Seistan I cannot, l fear, give you full information about the various sorts of tea now drunk by the Persians. The chief point in the tea trade in which I am, for the sake of the Indian grower, at present interested, is the route which will be most profitable for the introduction of the tea at present consumed in Persia. Much of this tea now finds its way to Tehran, Meshed and the north of Persia via Batoum, and much by Bushire and Bunder Abbas. It is hoped that the new route to Persia by Quetta and Nushki will be found the easiest, safest and cheapest route for all places in Central Eastern Persia, and even in Northern Persia; whether this is so or not entirely depends on the price which tea can be landed, say in Seistan. When I receive from you samples of tea with price duly marked as delivered at Quetta, I can calculate from here the cost of placing that tea on any market in Persia, when it will easily be seen whether the Nushki route is the best for the import of tea, as compared with other routes. This information will be a matter of very great importance, as from these figures together with other simi lar figures the paying possibilities of a railway from Quetta to Seistan can easily be calculated. Later on I leave Seistan for Meshed, and from there I shall, after having received samples of tea, etc., be in a better position to give you information about the tea taste in Persia. Provided samples are sent to Persia of tea, prices quoted and addresses given of agents selling at prices quoted, there is no lack of Persian merchants who will order. By their orders the tea taste of Persia can be gauged.4 Similar remarks to the above apply to indigo sales in Persia, and I await samples of indigo. 1 enclose a copy of a letter I have written to Mr. E. Macnaugh- ten. As regards gunny-bags. As at present informed 1 see no prospect for trade in this line. A sample gunny-bag labelled as the tea may, however, be sent to me addressed Meshed, where, I hope to be in about two months from now, when I shall be able to find out whether there is any demand or not. Later I shall send you samples of exports, though exports from Persia will not affect you in the same way as merchants at Bombay and Karachi. No. 130, dated Seistan via Quetta, Baluchistan, the 10th September 1900. From—M ajor G. Chenevix-TrENCH, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, To—E. Macnaughten, Esq., Secretary, Tirhut Indigo Planters’ Association, Muzzuffurpur. Mr. Duller Hughes writes to me that you are anxious for information regard ing indigo sale in Persia. Quoting from Lord Curzon’s book “ Persia ” which is the standard authority reeardins; trade in Persia, the total sales of indigo in Persia in 1889 were 150,000 Tomans valuing now at 50 krans a sovereign £30,000. Ten krans are eqmva- lent to 1 Toman. In 1897 the Meshed Trade Report gives £i9.°57 as the value of indigo imported into the Meshed district only. The common dress of the Persians is a coarse cloth dyed with indigo. The demand, therefore, may be said to be very large. The chief routes for importing indigo have been Bombay and Karachi to Bandar Abbas and Bushire, while some indigo has found its way to the north by the Russian route via Batoum. It is hoped that the Seistan route, which is the only route by which a railway can be brought to the border of Persia from India, may so divert the trade from the Bandar Abbas route, the Bushire route or the Batoum route that figures may be easily forthcoming for the establishment of a railway. I have men here who are willing to try the new route, but ask to be given the cost of indigo at Quetta. I w'ould now, therefore, ask you to send me samples of every quality of indigo with the following information attached to each sample written in English and Persian :— (1) Cost of sampled indigo per maund delivered at Quetta. (2) Name of firm or agents with full address willing to supply at the rates quoted. (3) Name of bankers with address to whom drafts should be made payable for goods at the time of ordering. (4) Any special remarks regarding the samples. On receipt of the samples I will deliver them to the agents here who are desirous of dealing in indigo. At least four samples of each quality should be sent to me by post. As the carrying power of the post is not great, the samples should be as light as possible, but must be packed in boxes either of wood or tin. No. 133, dated Seistan, Quetta (not Persia), the 10th September 1900. From— Major G. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, To—M essrs. Forbes, Forbes &amp; Co., Karachi. In reply to your letter of 31st May, only now to hand owing to having come via Persia and Persian Post, I am very glad to give you all the information I can.5 The following are the figures for wool here, and I enclose a sample of washed wool. Washed wool (sample sent), 8 krans per Seistani maund. Unwashed wool, 4 to 4^ krans per Seistani maund ; carriage to Quetta, Rs. 5 per Indian maund. Note. — 1 maund Seistani=6 Indian seers. Exchange ending quarter June 15th—355 krans=ioo rupees. Although there is an unlimited amount of wool, such as I send as sample, to be obtained here at the price I have quoted, the best wool is to be had from Bir- jaod, a matter of about 16 to no krans more in carriage. I cannot now quote you the price, but it is probably about the same as here for the same quality. In any case I would strongly recommend some enterprise in wool. It appears to me that exports must be a much more profitable trade from Persia than imports, owing to the depreciation of the currency and the establishment of a gold coinage even at the low rate of 15 rupees a sovereign in India. The Birjand merchants are just now waking to the fact of the new road which will carry their produce to India, and I look to a very rapid development. At present no one is buying wool here, and I would recommend that with the figures which I have quoted before your clients, it would be very wise were they to send some agent to purchase locally. The country is quite settled and the people are quiet and friendly. A knowledge of Persian is necessary. Messrs. Ralli Brothers have been in formed of the wool figures. I am urging the Imperial Bank of Persia to open a branch here to facilitate exchange of rupees and krans and for the issuing of drafts. As regards tea, I quite agree with your remarks that the China green tea should come by this route and Karachi. It is merely a matter of expense. If you will send me samples of green tea I shall be able to afford you very full information about the future prospects of bringing it by this route. To the samples of tea which you send me, please attach a label of strong paper. On the label please state the following : — 1. Trade name of tea. 2. Cost of sampled tea packed and delivered at Quetta ready for camel transport. 3 Name of firm with address ready to supply the tea at the price quoted. 4. Name of bank to whom drafts should be addressed when ordering tea. There is no lack here of men willing to buy tea, but if it is to come by Quetta they must know what it will cost. I can or they can calculate the cost of carriage from Quetta to any place in Persia, and make their purchase accord- ingly. The Quotations and descriptions on the sample labels should be written in Persian and English. No. 133. dated Seistan, via Quetta, the qth September 1900. From— Major G. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, To—The Bombay Chamber of Commerce. I have the honour to address you on a matter of importance concerning the opening of the trade route via Quetta to Persia through Nushki and Seistan. As you are aware there exists a very large trade in Anglo-Indian articles between Bombay or Karachi and Persia for the main part through the southern ports of Persia, Bunder Abbas and Bushire. These routes as far as the sea voyage is concerned are no doubt cheap and easy, but since the goods by these routes are consigned to many parts of Persia, a long distance in the interior, bad roads and Persian petty extortions mitigate to a large extent the advantages of the sea route.* The new road from Quetta to Seistan within British territory lands the goods at the most central place in Eastern Persia, from whence easy roads plentifully supplied with camel transport can carry the goods as far nor'h as Russian com petition allows, and as far south as competition with the southern ports permits. The new route therefore taps a large area of Central Eastern Persia. There can be no doubt as to the advantages in the matter of transport, secu rity and convenience of the new route over the older routes. The road from Quetta is over a level stretch of country, 626 miles long, which is in no way a desert, but now supplied with grazing-grounds and halting-places at equal distances along the entire route. At Seistan a British Consul is stationed for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of traders. It has begun to dawn on the large traders of Birjand and Seistan that the facilities of the Seistan route are greater than those of the Bunder Abbas route and I have been approached by the capitalists of Eastern Persia, with a view of ascertaining from me, first the nature of the new route, and, secondly, the cost of articles delivered, say in Seistan, carried by this route, com pared with the cost of articles carried over the Bunder Abbas route. As regards the first question, I have been able to thoroughly satisfy them. The security and abundance of transport meets with their requirements. Though I can tell them the cost of transport from Quetta to Seistan, on the second point I am unable to afford them the accurate information which the trade naturally requires It is therefore that I appeal to you in the interests of trade, in the interests of our political position in Persia, and lastly in the interest of India itself, for your help in affording me all the information which you can, so that I may be a medium for imparting this information to the traders who are keen on giving our new route a trial. I have taken some trouble to ascertain from the traders at Birjand, who may be considered the brokers or forwarding agents for all goods from India to the towns and districts of Central and Eastern Persia within the radius of profit, exactly what their requirements are, and in what form as regards weights and measures they require quotations. Attached is a list of the requirements of these merchants, and they ask me to obtain for them samples and quotations of trade prices for the articles enumer ated landed by the cheapest route in Quetta. I have promised to afford them every assistance in this way which l can and I have now to request the favour of your help in procuring these samples. As the samples required are numerous and their collection may be rather an undertaking, especially in the form and with the details attached which I shall ask for, I am prepared to pay for the temporary employment of a clerk at any reasonable rate to carry out the collection under your orders, and as I shall want the samples sent by post to me to Seistan, I am prepared to meet the cost of postage and packing, provided you will through the agency of your Chamber obtain for me the lowest quotation in the market. Should you be prepared to do this for me, I should be obliged if you will send me samples of all such articles, as in my attached list I have noted samples are required. In most instances three, four or more samples of the same article would be convenient for circulation among the various traders of Persia. To every sample I would ask you to attach a strong piece of paper with the following information written in English on one side and in Persian on the other :— 1 st .—Trade name of article sampled : trade mark should, if possible, be attached. 2 nd .—Cost per maund (Indian) gross, or roll (or than) of each article in Bombay. In the case of rolls of cloth, the weight of the roll should be given, as well as the number of yards in each roll. yd .—Cost of same delivered by cheapest route at Quetta. 67 4 th .—Name of firm or firms with full address willing to supply at the rates quoted. 5 th —Place of manufacture of goods whether in England, Germany, France, etc. Name of banker to whom drafts should be made payable for goods at the time of ordering. 7 th .—Any special remirks regarding the samples which might be of use to the trade. Remarks thus made on the paper at f ached to each article will be of infinitely more value than any letter addressed to me giving details concerning the samples, but it is important that all remarks be clearly written in Persian as well as English. These samples are anxiously awaited and the sooner they are sent the better. Any samples in addition to those asked for which would seem to be likely to have a market should be sent in a similar fashion. As the carrying power of the post to Seistan is not great the samples should be sent off in batches. As regards payment I have said I am prepared to meet the cost of postage and collection, and if I am unable to obtain the sanction of Government for the sum, will pay my c elf, but would leave it to the opinion of the Chamber of Commerce whether, first, a special clerk is necessary, second, whether it would be usual to pay for samples asked for, or whether the merchants interested would be prepared to meet the cost. In any case I am not prepared to see any failure in carrying out my requests in the manner I have stated from want of funds. List of articles required by the merchants of Birjand and Seistan for trade in Persia by the Quelta-Nushki route for which samples are required as stated below. Spices. —Cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, pepper, turmeric, yellow, and black myrobalan, samples and price per maund required. Ginger preserved in jars .—Price per 100 jars or per jar ; no sample required. Sal amoniac, if only one quality available no sample required, price per maund. Kalai ) used for tinning, if only one quality available no sample required, price per maund. Sulphur matches .—Sample of box required and price per gross. Candles .—Price per too or gross packets required, samples of Nos. 4, 6 and 8 required. Woollen stuffs, flannels, muslins, mukmulls, sheetings, chintzes, cottons, etc .—Samples required of all possible patterns and prices, and of all varieties, prices per roll, length and width, in English yards per roll and weight of each roll. Velvets, satins, silks and brocades —Do., do. Brass, iron and copper sheets .—No sample required, price per maund. Coffee, green unroasted berries .—Sample required, price per maund. Rice .—Sample required, price per maund. Prices given per maund should be as requested, given, both in Bombay and in Quetta. Articles of which samples are not required should be described ; priced, etc., on separate pieces of paper in a similar manner to articles sampled. Five or six samples should be sent of each article. Any articles similar in nature to the above enumerated ones should be sent in sample.8 No. 14^, dated Seistan, the I4-T5 f .h September 1900. From— Major G. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan, To—The Associated Chamber of Commerce, London. You are aware of the commercial rivalry existing in Persia between England and Russia. Russia holding to a large extent the markets of Northern Persia adjacent to her own border, while England commands entirely the markets of Southern Persia. The greater the facilities for the introduction of Anglo-Indian goods are through British territory, the further north will English goods penetrate. At present English merchandise, which is universally more appreciated in Persia than Russia, finds it hard to compete in the northern markets of Tehran and Meshed on account of the difficulty of transport from the ports of Bushire and Bunder Abbas in Southern Persia. A new and easy road has lately been opened from Quetta to the Persian border touching Persia in Seistan, a province of Khorasan, at the only spot where the borders of India are conterminous with those of Persia. The difference of this route over the Bunder Abbas route is that nearly half the distance is within British territory, and over this portion of the road no obstacles exist for the construction of a railway connecting at Quetta, and land ing the merchandise at the very border of Persia, from whence easy roads could distribute it in Northern and Eastern Persia. If the trade that at present exists between Bunder Abbas and Meshed can be diverted to this route, there can be no question about the paying possibi lities of a railway, and with this view before me, as Consul-General for Khorasan and Seistan, I am most anxious not only to introduce more English goods into Persia, but to pave the way for a speedy accomplishment of a railway from Quetta to Seistan. The Persian demand is for all sorts and kinds of articles which will pander to their taste of Oriental luxury, besides many articles which may be classed as belonging purely to civilised life. The Persian wholesale dealer is accustomed to dealing direct wffiich European firms from having had transactions with Moscow through Ashkabad on the Cas- pian-Russian railway. He shows great aptitude for trade and I believe, that provided means of buying English goods are put before him, will order largely. To those of them who are awakening to facilities and securities of the new route the question of cost presents itself, and I am constantly asked at what price could such and such an article be landed by rail at Quetta. With a view to meeting their desire to buy more English goods, and of afford ing them a means of accurately calculating the cost of any special merchandise to Quetta, I am anxious to obtain for the merchants at Meshed samples and quotations of English manufactures, from which they could order what they wished. It is to obtain these samples that I appeal to you for help through your organisation and through your touch with the various Chambers of Commerce and leading manufacturers of England. I append a copy of the total imports into Persia quoted from Lord Curzon’s standard book on Persia. The figures show the imports in the year 1889, and though on account cf the depreciation of the silver currency of Persia the value of imports may have declined, the total demand valued in Persian money has undoubtedly increased. The list will show you what are the main demands of Persia. Some imports obviously cannot be supplied by England at all, and some though supplied cannot well be sent in sample form, but of the next, laying special stress on woollen materials, I would be very glad to receive such samples as manufacturers would9 Ts) be willing to send me, but I must renup^f tViof fi-. i numerous, and be specimens of qualify nth r th 1G S ? mp es sent at ^ rs t be not too of roll must hav^label ffrmlyTtachedm'the formUS t'kh^i’s iettr^ 111 .

Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan, No. 14 &lt;, from 16 th to 30 th September 1900 . 18th September 1900. —The Karguzar appointed from Tehran, for the settlement of any questions arising from the presence of two Consuls here, arrived at Nasratabad. He unfortunately fell from his horse within a few miles from the city and severely injured his arm. My Hospital Assistant attended him at once. Though shaken he is progressing favourably. He is a very old man of about 70 years of age. 19th September. —Bolan Khan, Quetta horse-dealer, arrived from Meshed. He brought 63 horses bought in Meshed and surrounding districts. Ho was very pleased with the results of visiting Northern Khorasan where he had been well received by all classes. Muhammad Rahim Khan, formerly news-writer to the Russians in Seistan and latterly landlord and righthand man to Mr. Miller, visited Munshi Ahmad Din. He was loud in his complaints against the Russians who, he said, had treated him badly. He said he had now sold his house to Mr. Miller, and that owing to friction between himself and Mr. Miller’s Persian Mirza had quitted the Russian service altogether. He said Mr. Miller had made numerous mistakes here, the greatest being his not having called on Mir Massum Khan, Sartip. Mr. Miller, he said, was afraid to act on his own responsibility in this matter by calling, though he was thoroughly aware of the great mistake he had made. 21st September. —Visited Seth Suleiman’s new shop in the City. It is by far the best building within the dirty and tumble down fort of Nasratabad. It occupies a central position and is a very substantial mark of the progress we have made in Seistan. I am sorry that there are not more Indian traders in Seistan, for, besides the retail business of selling fancy goods to the Persians, there is a good trade to be done in exporting and importing wholesale. I should like to see the Parsee start business in Persia. His very education and general bearing suit him admirably for commercial enterprise in Persia, which after all is his own country. I am writing to the head of the Parsee com munity in Bombay on the subject of the Seistan route to Persia, and asking him to do all he can to encourage some of his community to venture to Persia by this new route. If a Parsee merchant would tour through Persia with a caravan of goods, he would do a very good trade and would be able to select a place to start business in, which offered the most favourable prospects. 22nd September. —Received a visit from the Intizam-i-Diwan, one of the Mamurs here. The Sartip, Mir Massum Khan, in conversation with Hospital Assistant Ghulam Jilani, said he had not behaved well to former English officers visiting Seistan, and that then he had not rightly understood the position of affairs; now he was only anxious to be in favour with the British Government who were his powerful neighbours. He also mooted the question of visiting India on the plea of seeing an oculist. I ordered Ghulam Jilani to say that medically he * could advise the Sartip to go to India to see an oculist, but that it rested with the Sartip to obtain the sanction of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. In the evening began the quarrel in Bolan Khan’s camp over the donkey 'which ended in the attack on syces on the following morning. I have already reported fully both the beginning as well as the sequel to the attack. The quarrel over the donkey was paltry, merely an exchange of abuse between two Persians. Bolan Khan was not in the camp at the time, and was in no way mixed up in this quarrel which ended unfortunately in a serious affray. 23rd September. —As I have already reported, at about 9 o’clock in the morning, a large cro\vd of men from the city deliberately attacked with sticks2 Bolan Khan’s camp, severely wounding him and all the syces who were present. The crowd fled on my appearance back to the city in some alarm. I found the damage was 5 men severely wounded and 8 men badly beaten. In the evening I visited the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk. I found him strangely ignorant of what had taken place, facts had evidently been kept from him. I explained the seriousness of the case to him, and said that nothing but very prompt measures on his part could save the discredit to him which such an affair happening at his capital must necessarily bring. I said I quite understood that the attack was not one made against me personally or against any of my camp, but that it being made against the camp of a British subject who had done harm to no one in no way lessened the offence. Ignorance on the part of the people who made the attack that Bolan Khan was a British subject was no excuse, and that I demanded at once that the ringleaders should be severely punished to the number of ten. I further said that it had been reported to me that the Amir’s own Nazir had excited the people to attack. The Amir questioned the Nazir who said he certainly was in the gateway when the crowd was going to make the attack, but that he, instead of urging them on, was only sending men to bring back the attackers. I told the Amir that I did not consider the Nazir’s excuses were to be relied on, and said I should after further enquiry probably demand that he should also be punished. The Nazir is the most trustworthy servant the Amir has, besides being his brother-in-law. The Amir promised to make every enquiry and to afford me every satisfaction ; he was very alarmed at the occurrence and extremely annoyed that the Nazir and his own servants were the chief culprits. 24th September .—The Amir came to visit me and saw Bolan Khan and the wounded men ; he held a sort of informal enquiry which to all appearance seemed to amount to very little but which was quite sufficient, as it afterwards showed, to prove to the Amir the seriousness of the affair and even enabled him to come down on all the ringleaders. The Sartip, Mir Massum, sent to say how sorry he was about the attack, and hoped his father would deal very severely with the offenders. 2oth September .—Munshi Ahmad Bin attended at the Ark, where the Amir had ordered that the ringleaders should be punished. Everything had been prepared for the usual Persian method of beating by sticks. The Amir closed the city gates, and there was no escaping for any offenders. Any man that was sworn to by Bolan Khan and his syces as being present at the affray was beaten until 10 men who had been the ringleaders were severely punished in front of all the Sardars and Katkhudas of Seistan. The. Amir in no way evaded punishing, though many were his private servants. 26th September .—As I had demanded that the Nazir should be punished, the Amir sent him up to me, accompanied by Mustophi Khalik Khan, the Mamur from Meshed. He sent a letter at the same time, saying that the Nazir had been a very faithful servant to him for many years, and he hoped after hearing his story I should treat him leniently; he added that if I believed him guilty, it would be for me to order the punishment I thought fit. After this unconditional surrender of his Nazir and brother-in-law, I was bound, I thought, to treat him mildly. I consequently gave him a severe warning against ever being again implicated in any show of disrespect to the British Consul, and made him write an apology and promise good behaviour towards us for the future. He was much frightened, and I think the warning was sufficient for him. I consider the Amir behaved well throughout the whole proceeding and I wrote and told him I considered he had, also that I had been given full satisfaction and consequently closed the affair. I was just in time to catch the Meshed post and to send not only details of the attack, but was able to state that I had closed the affair. No one was, therefore, able to send reports of the affair to Tehran before my full report would be received by the Chargd3 d’Affaires. I quite believe Mr. Miller would have liked to have made the most of the attack as an excuse either to increase his own escort here or to work the downfall of the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk. The Amir’s prompt action and my having closed the incident should quite prevent any Kussian say in the matter. On the whole, the incident has been very fortunate, for it has taught the people to be very careful what they do towards British subjects, and has in no way strained my relations with the Amir or any of the leading Sardars here. 27th September .—The Sartip, in conversation with Hospital Assistant Ghulam Jilani, expressed his great wish to visit India and Calcutta. He said also that the Kussian Vice-Consul to whom he has never spoken sent for Ali Akbar Khan, his relative, and privately told him that, as the Amir and the Sarhang were so very friendly to the English Consul, and as he knew that the Sartip was at some variance with his father over the return of the Sardars Saiyid Khan and Jehan Khan to Seistan, he hoped the Sartip would count on his (the Russian) support. The Sartip says he sent back a polite reply, but said that as a dutiful son he had no desire to go against the wishes of his father, and that he had nothing to do with the Russians. I believe the story to be true and bears out what I have always thought was Mr. Miller’s policy in Seistan, viz., to estrange the Sartip Mir Massum from his father, the Hashmat- ul-Mulk, to take up his cause and eventually to triumphantly lead him to the Ark in Nasratabad as ruler of Seistan, Mr. Miller hoping to secure through the Sartip the support of his uncle, Sardar Saiyid Khan, Naroi, and through him again his powerful following of border Baluchis. This scheme is now completely frustrated in a great measure by Mr. Miller himself through not having called on the Sartip, though in reality in any case Mr. Miller could not have hoped for success, for he was deceiving himself that the Saukat-ul-Mulk was completely Russianized, and that he w r ould have affected the opinion of the Sartip while he was there. The Saukat-ul-Mulk at Birjand, I am beginning to find out is as much inclined to us as his brother, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. 28th September .—Paid a visit to the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk to assure him that our relations were in no way altered owing to the recent events. Paid a visit to Mir Massum Khan, Sartip. He had the conversation chiefly about India, asked whether a good oculist could be seen in Quetta, and hinted he w T ould prefer to go to Calcutta if it ever came about that he visited India. Three pilgrims arrived from Meshed; they said they had heard about the Seistau route from Persia to India when in Baghdad, and had consequently visited Meshed with the intention of returning to India by it. After three years’ absence from India, they were delighted to find themselves again among Hindustani-speaking people. 29th September .—The Jemadar of my cavalry escort visited the Sartip, and he gathered that the Amir had given his consent to the proposed visit to India. I have ordered that the projected visit to India be not discussed by my subordinates more than they can help. I do not wish to appear to be actively inducing the Sartip to take the step. The Karguzar from Tehran called on me. He had somewhat recovered from his fall. He appeared to be a pleasant, old fashioned, easy going old gentleman, and I do not anticipate his giving any trouble. He remarked that it was a pleasure to him to see my buildings and to notice some advancement in Seistan w'hich appeared to him to be a very backward country. 30th September .—Paid a visit to the Sarhang and found him occupying a very good II feet square hill tent, which he bought through Seth Suleiman from India. He was very pleased with it. The Sarhang takes great pleasure in building and in buying furniture, &amp;c., for his new rooms. Since the arrival of Seth Suleiman, he has spent a considerable sum of money on such things as chairs, tables, beds, lamps, &amp;c., and has fitted his rooms with gauze doors from India. The establishment of a British Consulate here and the arrival of an Indian shop have raised the standard of civilisation generally.Mr. Miller has through Seth Suleiman bought two Kabul tents and several smaller ones for servants. lie invited me to pay him a visit in his camp when it was pitched, lie had altogether 4 tents of about the size of Kabul tents, and 6 or 8 servants’ tents. He said he w r ould be the first Kussian officer wdio had such a camp, that the majority of them never travelled at all and wdien they did always put up in some native’s house. He also informed me that the new doctor whom he expected soon, and for w r hom he was sending his Cossack bashi to Meshed, w r as to be his brother, who intended bringing with him his wife and tw T o children. News from Birjand from Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali at Birjand. I am receiving very encouraging reports as regards the trade from Birjand. There is no doubt that the merchants there have begun to take a lively interest in the new route to India. At present they are naturally somewhat reticent about launching their caravans by a route that is unknown to them, and land ing them at Quetta where they are not sure wdiat market they will find. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk has set a very good example by sending his own camels laden with produce , of Birjand to fetch the doors and windows he has ordered from Quetta. A leading merchant has now started 30 camels as a trial trip, who are to bring back manufactured goods and Indian sugar for sale in Birjand. When the caravan arrives here, I will give them every assistance, and I hope they will receive great attention and help in Quetta; any help which w ill ensure the caravan being a success will be very valuable. At all costs, the caravan must be well received, its failure would check for a long time the desire of the Birjand merchants to adopt the Quetta route in preference to the Bunder Abbas route. I have received a petition from the Birjand merchants asking for some concessions by our new route. Some of the concessions asked for are unreason able, but I am forwarding their petition separately to the Government of India for favourable consideration. The success of the Seistan route is a matter of so much importance that I hope that some of the concessions may be granted by the Government. What is needed now is some good advertisement to the road. If I had several Indian traders here now with capital who were to send off large caravans realising handsome profits, very many Persians would follow, for they only aw^ait a lead. Every building erected on the road acts as an advertisement and brings an increase to traffic. I have already asked that a caravanserai be built at Quetta and that a trustworthy broker be put in charge, and hope soon to be able to report to the trader that a Government broker now exists in Quetta. I am doing all I can to obtain for the merchants in Persia quotations of prices ruling in Karachi and Quetta, and have sent samples of most of their exports to India. A concession, however ever so small, w ould, I am sure, attract a large amount of trade; such concessions are, I believe, not unusual in the case of opening new routes. I am informed that Colonel Temple has made a suggestion from Meshed that a drawback should be given in Karachi on all goods destined for Persia by the Nushki route, which drawback would be accepted by the Bailway in part payment of freight. Such a concession pro mulgated to the Persian merchants would have immediate results. I am my self quite confident that in the end the Seistan route will be the most popular route between India and Persia and even between England and Eastern Persia, but much time could be saved if some alluring attractions v’ere held out to the merchants. Seth Suleiman means to apply for sanction to build a caravan (sic) here. If he succeeds in doing this, it will act as a brilliant advertisement to the route. In a few days he will start a caravan of about 100 camels laden with ghee and w T ool: he could send many more had he the capital. (Sd.) G. Chenevix-Trench, Major, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan. Foreign Office Press—No. 2300—14-H-00—31.Diary No. 22 of Major 6. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, for period from 16th January to 3ist January 190^v/ The whole fortnight amounted to nothing short of a struggle between myself and the Russian Vice-Consul as to whether Sartip Mir Ma/sum Khan t*, should visit India to consult an oculist or not. / Mr. Miller made as much capital out of the event as he could ; his actions set all Seistan talking about Kussian and British influences—a gossip which the Persians enjoyed much. On the 24th January, Mr. Miller’s brother and his wife reached Seistan. They were given no reception by the Persians. The following day they duly called together on me. Dr. Miller'is a younger man than his brother, the Consul. He has had no experience previously in what may be called eastern countries, such as Persia, but was a doctor on board a Russian man-of-war. He came with his wife direct from Petersburgh. At his first visit I spoke quite plainly to both him and his brother regarding medical etiquette, in that he wished to treat the Sartip Mir Aiarfsum, iv/ who at present was in the hands of the English doctor Ghulam Jelani. 1 said / I hoped he would not bring politics into medical service. I reminded him that our doctor both here and at Meshed had attended to cases of sickness in the Russian Consulates. I then extracted from him what wa^Jmedical etiquette when two doctors attended one patient, and after some discussion both he and his brother, the Consul, agreed that, if a second doctor was called in and offered different treatment to that of the first, it rested with the patient to decide which doctor he would employ. Having secured this point, I said no more. The following day the Russian doctor in the presence of the Amir and our doctor Ghulam Jelani examined the Sartip’s eyes. It was at once apparent that the Russian doctor knew very little of his profess ; on. He condescended to argue the case with Dr. Ghulam Jelani, who very cleverly showed his superior knowledge to the Persians present. The arguments became common property in the town. Later the Russian doctor suggested trying some medicines, but the Sartip said that, as these medicines had been already tried and had done no good, he refused to submit to a second treatment. The Sartip also argued that, until he bad seen some successful cures on the eyes of others, he objected to having his eyes experimented on. So the arguments went on from day to day. Mr. Miller, the Consul, paid numerous visits to the Mullahs ; he brought them copies of the Civil and Military Gazette, and showed them the plague returns. He spread reports that the English wished to retain the Sartip, etc. He called in the services of an utterly ignorant Persian doctor ; in fact, he employed every means, and used every influence he could, to make the Sartip submit to his brother’s treatment, or at least to delay until the season had become too advanced for him to travel to India. I remained quiet during the week trusting to the Sartip holding out against any Russian treatment, and to the general opinion of the Mullahs and the Amir. Gradually it became apparent to me that the Mullahs and all the leading men, with the Amir, were much against the Russian doctor tampering in any way with the Sartip’s eyes. The Amir, however, still lacked the pluck to openly tell the Russians that he refused their treatment. I consequently visited the *Amir Hashmut-ul-Mulk. I reminded him that, since the Sartip refused the Russian treatment, nothing remained but for him to dismiss them, and make up his mind to send the Sartip to India. I told him that, according to their own agreement with me, they could now say nothing. If now he did not send the Sartip to India, everyone from here to Quetta would be informed that the Russians had not allowed the English to treat him, in fact had prevented the English from acquiring the influence they desired over the coming man in Seistan. I said that the onus of such loss of prestige would rest on him. This brought him to his senses ; he promised to visit the Russian Consul, inform him that the Sartip did not agree to his treatment, and said that, after consulting the stars and the astrologers, the Sartip should go to India,2 • &gt; The Amir was true to his word, and the Sartip started from here with a folio win 0, 'of about fifteen men on the 5th February for India. With him I sent GhulaniJelani, the Hospital Assistant. This 1 was obliged to do, as the Sartip would never have undertaken the journey to India without an interpreter. To replace Ghulam Jelani, I shall send for Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali from Birjand, making Seth Suleman’s agent there act as our agent until L reach there in a month, when I will see how the arrangement works, and whether it will be necessary to ask for the services of another Hospital Assistant during Ghulam Jelani s absence. It is not easy to say how long Sartip Mir Majtfsum Khan will remain in India. The choice of 1 season is late for going to India, as the return journey must be very hot, unless he remains in India for the hot weather. I am writing officially to ask that the best oculist in India may be named to him. Every one except the 'Russians is very glad that the Sartip has been able to go to India. He is a Chief that commands universal respect. At present he shows every promise of becoming a very enlightened ruler. Unlike his father and bis brother, the Surhang, he is particularly abstemious, and in no way given to debauch. In conversation he is quiet and intelligent. I hope that his trip to India may not only be the means of restoring wholly his eyesight, but of an opportunity of becoming lanuhar with lintish wa^s in India. As the head Mullah said to me, “ He is worth training. ,, He took with him from here some Rs. 6,000 for his expenses. He is prepared to go to Calcutta for the benefit of his eyes, and even to Europe, if necessary. * # # The Hashmut ul-Mulk is prepared to send him more money, as he requires it. The day before he left 1 received from the Wali at Meshed unconditional leave for him to visit India. I arranged to get. this from Meshed by special messenger to Colonel Temple, before the Itussians would have time to extract any more provisional sanctions. The Wali denied to Colonel Temple ever having issued a second order that the Sartip was to await the arrival of the Kussian doctor. It is impossible to say whether he did or not, or whether Mr. Miller obtained the statement out of the Hashmut-ul-Mulk under threats. For our prestige it is good that the Sartip has left, and the more mortifying to the llussians, since they showed their hand in playing to prevent his leaving. qphey being able to abolish the quarantine and to send off the Sartip in the face of the Ilussinn opposition has raised our prestige considerably. Mr. Miller requires constant watching; he and his numerous paid underlings adopt every unfair means of thwarting us at every step. Not a caravan leaves for Quetta that Russian petty agents do not spread among the camel-men reports of terrible plague in Quetta. Even the fact that Captain Bonn was detained by heavy rain was made use of, for the Sartip was told that he would experience great trouble on the road. The dishonest brokers and the absence of a caravanserai in Quetta were freely used as arguments to deter caravans from going to Quetta. I regret to say that seven camels from the large Birjand caravan, which I reported as having left here a fortnight ago, have died before they reached two stages. As this caravan was a very important one to us, I have doubts whether some Russian agents have not been employed to poison the camels. This may seem an extraordinary statement, but the pleasant exterior manner of the Russian Vice-Consul has before now covered some very underhand actions on his part. Trade prospects continue to be good. G. CHENEVIX-TRENCH, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Scistan, G. I, C. P. O.—No. 1006 F. D.—8 3-1901.—31.—Exd.—P. M M.V r Diary of Major G.

The flag of the Eussian Vice-Consul, together with my own, was lowered to half-mast. The Eussian Vice-Consul paid me a visit in full uniform. All the Persian officials, viz.) the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, his two sons, the head Mullas and leading men of Seistan at once called at my Consulate to express their sympathy. (Sd.) G.

I received letters from Major Chenevix-Trench recommending me, if possible, to pay a visit to MirjaWa on my way to Seistan as a set off against the activity of the Russian Vice-Consul among the people of the Perso-Afghan border in Seistan. After consulting with Captain Webb-Ware I decided to branch off to Mirjawa from Saindak, three stages ahead. Captain Webb-Ware accompanies me as far as Saindak. 26th January— 9.

Zaroudny, the Kussiap naturalist, who is proceeding from Seistan southwards in the direction of Mirjayva. I therefore arranged to send my main camp to Robat and to start myself with a small camp and a few orderlies for Mirjawa. An influential Persian merchant with some valuable carpets from Kirman arrived in the evening. BOth January — 13. March to Mirjawa 23 m i] es . (1) The main camp left for Robat by the main road at 8-30 thi^ mornino 1 . I started at the same time for Mirjawa. (2) The track runs through low hills until the Bug Springs are reached at 10 miles. It then enters the Mirjawa Pass, which in parts is extremely difficult for laden animals. The pass is about 8 miles in length and from the summit the descent to the Mirjawa plain is rapid. The western entrance to the Pass is reached at 18 miles and the track, turning south, runs across a stony daman or glacis at the foot of which lies the Mirjawa cultivation. (3) Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan, the head of the Held tribe, who was on his way to Saindak to meet Captain Webb-Ware, met me at the Bug Springs. 1 told him that I had instructions from the Political Assistant ordering him°to accompany me; he therefore turned back and rode with me into camp! (4) The Mijawa cultivation lies on the left bank of the Mirjawa stream in the angle formed by the junction of the latter with the Bar-i-Graban nalla {vide paragraph 14(2) ). Bor the sake of clearness I have called this New Mirjawa. Old Mirjawa with its ruined fort, built some seven generations back, lies 2 miles to the south-west. The place is deserted and the ground is at present uncultivated, the nomad inhabitants having apparently transferred thpir residence to New Mirjawa. The Mirjawa water on emerging from the hills to the west, a little below Ladis, bifurcates into two channels, one-third of the water going in the original channel to Old Mirjawa and two-thirds in a recently-made channel to New Mirjawa. I encamped at the latter place. The Sardar does not now live here. His head-quarters are at Mirkoh, about 12 miles south-west of Mirjawa and 2^ miles from Ladis. J 2 (а) Much uncertainty exists, I understand, regarding the direction of the boundary line as it approaches the Mirjawa district from the south ; and it is still doubtful whether the strip of country, over which Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan rules, lies within or without our border. There were no pillars that I could see to show how the boundary ran. The Sardar is fully conscious of this and the rather spasmo/ic nature of his allegiance to us may perhaps be accounted for in this way. But the fact that he accepts pay from us and is held responsible for the supply of forage to the thanas along the route from oaindak to Robat appears to have diminished this uncertainty in his mind ^ to have induced him to regard the country as ours and himself as a servant of the British Government. This opinion seemed to be shared bv all I came in contact with, and I have, therefore, assumed throughout my visit that Mirjawa lay within our boundary. ^ (б) (б) In the evening the Sardar gave me the following account of Mons Zaroudny s visit to these parts ° Uons * The Russian party arrived in the neighbourhood of Ladis on the 26th January, encamping at Kunrod, 2 miles west of Ladis, at the head of the3 Mirjawa water. They remained there until the 28th when they left for Gusht en route to the Persian Coast. They stated their intention of travelling by the following route :— Gazo. Drukan Naraf. Gusht. Dizak. Sib. Magas. Serbaz. No mention was made as to what point on the coast they intended making for. Prom the coast they proposed returning to Bam pur ; but no information was forthcoming as to their onward movements. The party consisted of 8 or 9 in all, viz :— fa Two Bussians. —Mons. Zaroudnj\ and his companion. Two Persians .—One Haji, their interpreter, and another. Two Prahui guides .— Supplied by Sardar Pasand Khan of Seistan. Two or three camel men. They had one tent between them and 10 camels, four of the latter being laden with long wooden boxes said to contain rifles. The whole partv travelled on foot. Mons. Zaroudny, while professing to be travelling for pleasure and in the interests of natural history, freely used binoculars and what was described as a “ large compass in a box.” He ascended the adjacent hills and made notes of the surrounding country. His companion spent his time in shooting and collecting animals, the skins of which were preserved. Both Mons° Zaroudny and his companion were unable to converse in Persian. The Sardar was at his home at Mir Koh when the party arrived at Kunrod. The following day he was summoned to Ladis. The bearer of the summons was the inter^ preter, Haji, wlm brought with him an order signed by the Mali of Meshed, requesting all Persian officials along the route to assist Mons. Zaroudny and his party, and to see that they were in no way “ molested or plundered.” This document was read to the Sardar by the Mulla of Ladis. In response to this the Sardar went to Kunrod to pay his respects to Mons. Zaroudny, when the latter stated that he was desirous of becoming his friend and pressed him to accept a rifle. He also said that he was anxious to visit Mirjawa. In reply the Sardar indignantly refused the rifle and informed Mons, Zaroudny that as the British boundary extended from Duzab in the north via Ladis to Mirjawa he could not allow him to cross the border. The Persian interpreter then expostulated that this statement was incorrect, and that as the Kussian Govern ment had just bestowed “nine crores of rifles on the Shah” the Persian authorities were in a position to dispute the boundary. The above was the Sardar’s statement in brief; but having been warned of his propensity for untruthfulness and the general unreliability of his character, I thought it well to have his story verified. r lhe Mulla of Ladis and the Sardar’s son happened to arrive in camp during my interview with the Sardar and I at once sent for the former. He corroborated the Sardar’s statement on the main ; but volunteered the inform ation that the Sardar had accepted a rifle and 96 cartridges from Mons. Zaroudny. Subsequently, the Sardar’s son, who came to pay his respects, gave me the same information. I then confronted the Sardar with his son and the Mulla; but in the meantime the old man appeared to have partaken freely of opium and he was unable to make a coherent statement on his defence. He concluded by admitting that he had accepted a rifle because he had been persuaded to do so by the Persian interpreter. I told him that I could not accept such a frivolous excuse, and I then dismissed him. 31st January — 14 . Halt. 1 (1) In the morning I taxed the Sardar with his disloyalty to the British Government and told him that an explanation would be required of him. He promised to bring me the rifle when I visited Lndis. He had been led to expect the present of a revolver from me; but I informed him that this4 would now be withheld until a satisfactory explanation of his conduct was forthcoming, and that in the meantime he might expect no further hospi tality from me. While dealing out chastisement, however, to the Sardar with one hand I treated the local inhabitants, wherever I went, liberally with the other. I paid extravagant prices for the supplies brought into my camp. In the afternoon I held some sports, at which the country side attended and I gave liberal prizes to the winners of the different events. I also gave the Mulla of Ladis a handsome present. My action in so doing contrasted favourably with the conduct of the Russian party during their visit. They seem to have earned for themselves the reputation of being misers, as they haggled over the price of the few supplies which they purchased. (2) During the day I took the opportunity of riding round the neighbour hood with the object of testing the accuracy of existing maps. There seems to be no doubt that the latter are wholly inaccurate as far as the position of *“ Parts of Persia, Afghanistan and Baluchis- the JVIirjawa Rivei is COUCemed. Ill the tau,” No. 35-s., dated March 1900 . map I had with me* which, I believe, is the most recent one, the Mirjavva River is so called from a point E of the place marked “ Marjawa ” where a stream called the “ Padha River ** joins it. That is to say, for a considerable distance up stream in a north west direction, from the point of juncture, the water-course is called the “ Mirjawa River.” After careful enquiries, both here and at Ladis, this appears to me to be quite incorrect. What in the map is called the “ Mirjawa River” should be the “ Dar-i-Giaban, and what is termed the “ Padha River” should be the Mirjawa River. Padha is a small strip of cultivation, 9 miles to the west, close to Ladis. The Marjawa River has its source in the Kunrod Spring, about 2 miles north of Ladis, and 300 yards about the place marked “ Barziar ” on the map. Prom its source until it reaches a point about 20 miles south-east of Mir jawa, when it becomes the Reg-i-Malik, it is known generally as the Mirjawa River though it changes its name according to the locality through w'hich it passes. Thus from Kunrod to Ban/an (1^ miles) it is called “ the Bangan from Bangan vid Ladis to Padana (6 miles) it is called the Ladis River; at Padaha for a few hundred yards it is the Padaha ; and thence for a distance of nearly 35 miles until it becomes the Reg-i-Malik it is known as the Mirjawa River. It will, therefore, be seen that, with the exception of about 8 miles of its course, the water is known as the Mirjawa water. It has a powerful flow throughout which seems capable of considerable development. At present it irrigates a few scanty plots of cultivations at Barziar, Bangan, C Ladis, Padaha and Mirjawa after which it runs to waste in the sandy nalla bed ' a little below New Mirjawa. Before reaching the plain, about 8 miles below * Ladis, it runs between precipitious banks 50 to 100 feet high and the river ^ bed is often 50 yards widejj^hat in the present maps is called the Mirjawa River (which I have pointed out should be the Dar-i-Giaban) is an insignifi cant depression in the ground—a dry, shallow bed of sand with a strip of scorched tamarisk jungle to mark its course. In view of the above facts I venture to suggest that it would be well to have this ill-detined portion of the country carefully re-surveyed and the resulting map compared with the terms of the Perso-Baluch Boundary Agree ment. (3) There seems to be no doubt that Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan and the local inhabitants are prepared to recognise Mirjawa as falling within our border, but, as long as the present uncertainty regarding the boundary exists, they are unwilling to commit themselves in any way for fear of incurring the displeasure of the Persian authorities. In the latter event they seem to doubt whether they could rely on us for support. It also seems equally certain that the Persian authorities are beginning to realize that we cherish hopes of including this district within our border. 1 st February — 15 . March to Ladis . 12 miles.5 / * rl) I left my camp standing at Mirjawa and marched to Ladis with a ' de tent and two orderlies. Four miles from camp the track crosses the Siriawa River diagonally running along the river bed which is here 50 yards wide. It then skirts the right bank passing the Padaha cultivation at 8 miles, and reaching Ladis at 12 miles. Ladis is merely a strip of cultivated ground with a single grass hut lying on the right bank of the stream below the ancient ruins of the Ladis Port. The latter^ said to have been built by Rustam, is a curious pile of ruins, built on the summit and sides of a long, narrow bluff of rock which overlooks the river bed. Accompanied by Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan I visited during the day Alanian Bangan, Barziar, and Kunrod—plots of cultivation each round a ruined fort and with a few nomad inhabitants in the vicinity. At Kunrod I inspected the spring which forms the head of the Mirjawa wa*er It is situated in the midst of a patch of dense tamarisk jungle and the flow of water from the outset is a vigorous one. It was here that. Mons. Zaroudny pitched his tent and stayed three days. Kunrod is on the mam road to Seistan from the south vid Dozab and the Bed Pass. 2nd February — _ 16. March to Mirjawa tta Mirkoh ...... io mues. On my return journey to Mirjawa to-day I visited the residence of Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan at Mirkoh. Unlike the other places I have seen in this district, which is characterised by a singular dearth of inhabitants, M - 1 ^k°“ contains 30 or 40 families who live in blanket tents close to the new kort which the Sardar has recently built for himself. During my visit the Sardar shewed me the rifle which Mons. Zaroudny had o-iven him and he expressed his intention of taking it with him to Robat and surrendering it to the Political Assistant there. The rifle is an old single- barrelled breech-loader of the Mannlecher pattern. It is dated ‘ 1877 and is sighted up to 1,400 yards. * 25 SM Ternary— 17 . March to Mahomed Khan Chah 25 miles. The weather has been intensely cold with hard frost at night. Many of the camp are suffering from fever. This is merely a halting place in a narrow ravine. There are no supplies, and we had to dig a well for water. 4th February — 18 . March to Duzab 36 miles. A long and tedious march over difficult ground. Here there is a strip of cultivation watered by 3 karezes, the property o one Syed Khan, a Gurgej-Rakshani, who appears to have settled here about 35 years ago. Duzab still continues to supply the Robat thana regularly with forage. During the past year about 40 maunds had been sent by Syed Khan. I He latter is eager to become a British subject; but as ffing as the boun ary remains undefined, he shares with the people of Mirjawa the same ear o offending the Persian authorities if he openly throws in his lot with us. HQ was recently sent for by the Sartip of Narmashir and warned agains ^ving dealings with the British Government. In lieu of sending one-third ot his produce as tribute to the Sartip he gives him his younger bio er an wo nephews for service. In this way he is enabled to keep up is S ^PP y fera m to the Robat thana. He is most anxious that a tham should be built at Duzab and that he should be given service. 5 (Ji February— 19 . March to Robat 25 miles. A very difficult march by the Gudar-i-Kasur route and the Lar Koh range. I found my main camp here awaiting my arrival. There are some cases of fever among the men and my camels are much fatigued with the hard marching of the past week. I am, therefore, a mg here a few days to give them a rest./ 0 Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan came to see me to-day to beg for 1Ja for his recent act of disloyalty to us. He proposes to send the°Russian t with a letter to Mr. Mjdller, Russian Vice-Consul in Seistan, asking him return it to Mons. Zaroudny. I am not dissuading him from adopting this course. Camp Robat ; The 5th February 1901. R. A. E. BENN, Captain, Hie Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul for Seistan and Kain*Diary of Major 6. Chenevix-Trench, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, for period from 1st January to 15th January 1501. The past fifteen days have been notable for the open endeavonr of Mr. Miller to prevent the bartip Mir Mansum Khan from visiting India to consult an oculist. In my last diary I mentioned the fact that Mr. Miller, who has not as yet made an exchange of visits with the Sartip, prompted Mr. Zarodny, the natural ist, to alarm both the Amir and the Sartip of the risks there were of contract ing plague, etc., in India, if the proposed journey were undertaken. The result of these statements had no immediate effect. The Sartip continued his preparations and even sent off his advance transport, when Mr. Miller pro duced an arranged order from the Wali at Meshed, saying that the Sartip’s visit to India was to be postponed until the arrival of Mr. Miller’s brother, the doctor, and that if the Russian doctor was unable to cure his eyes, the journey to India might be undeitaken. Mr. Miller backed this order by threatening the Ilashmat-ul-Mulk with condign punishment, and displeasure from Russia, should the Sartip be allowed to go to India, even at all. M r. Miller’s brother was to arrive in fifteen days, and the Amir said it was quite impossible to go against the order he had received. The Sartip’s start was therefore counter-ordered, and the visit postponed. I saw the Hashmat-ul-Mulk at a private visit; he had evidently been frightened. He said the Russians had been reporting him to Tehran and Meshed for having thrown in his lot so openly with the Engiish. He said many false stories had been circulated about him, that he had received heavy payments from the English and had virtually abdicated his rights in Seistan in favour of the British Consul. The Amir, who is still smarting under the extortionate demands for money from Meshed, felt that he could not utterly ignore the Wall’s order. He said let the Sartip wait until Mr. Miller’s brother arrives, and if he cannot improve his eyes in a few days, or if we find any other excuse, we will send the Sartip to India, as the Wali has ordered. I need hardly remark that the position is not altogether satisfactory. Mr. Miller has scored a point, not in the least from any local influence, but by using the superior influence from the north of Persia. Pear holds such a strong place in Persian minds that 1 have grave doubts whether the visit to India may not be evaded. It is unfortunate that the matter has been made so political. A month ago I could, no doubt, have started the Sartip, but hesitated taking the step, not wish ing to embai^iss the Minister, or the Government of India, by taking the step until I received an answer to my request as to whether the visit would be approved of. The attitude of the Sartip himself is one of hostility to the Russians: he resents the fact that Mr. M iller never called on him, and argues that this latest move of the Russian Consul is directed against him out of spite. Ii e vows that under no circumstances will he submit to Mr. Miller’s treatment, but ends qf' saying that it rests with his father, the Amir, whether in the end he goes or not. Mr. M iller is making the utmost use of the delay he has caused. He has told the Amir that Russia ! will never agree to the Sartip’s visit to India, that the English wish to hold him as a hostage, that they wish to hold him up as a Chief over the Baluchis, and as a force ready at all times to bully the Amir into granting concession, etc. The Russian Consul has even gone v so far as to say that Russia will pay all expenses, and send the Sartip to the Czar’s private doctor if the trip to India is abandoned, etc. I he Amir and the Sartip have a very fair knowledge of Russian ways, and are not easily deceived by such extravagant promises, and severe threats. At the same time the position is delicate, for Persian staunchness or even integrity are not to be relied on. I have several counter-moves to make to Mr. Miller’s moves, and we may yet hope to see the. Sartip safely landed at Quetta. Mr. Miller’s brother should reach Seistan in about four days now.2 I have before mentioned that Mr. Miller devotes much time towards culti vating friendly relations with the Baluchis. He has latterly been lavish in distri buting costly lungis to any Baluch who seems to be presented to him. He is entirely ignorant about Baluchis, and v r orks through a man who has no position among them. Consequently his presents sometimes fall on what are to him valueless heads, for men are brought to him from within the Afghan border*. Baluchis he would rather leave alone in preference for Persian Baluchis. In my last diary I reported the arrival of Mr. Zarodny, the Russian natural ist. Though he cannot speak Persian or Baluchi, 1 find that these omissions do not deter him from endeavouring to carry on political intrigues under the guise of being a naturalist. At first I was inclined to look on him as what he professed to be, but I hear he must be considered as playing the same rble, as most peripatetic Russians in the South and East of Persia. On his leaving Seistan, nominally for Kirman and the sea, he visited Sardar Egad Khan, the Baluch Chief, who guards our road from here to Robat and for whom a monthly stipend has been applied for. When with Syad Khan he pressed on him the gun he had brought for him; he ridiculed his not accept ing it, taunting him with being afraid of the English. He told the Sardar that Russia was prepared to pay him as much as Bs. 1,000 a month, and Rs. 500 a month to every headman he produced. Syad Khan, I believe, answered Mr. Zarodny very rudely, and refused the gun in as discourteous a way as he could. Mr. Zarodny, Syad Khan reports to me, said he intended going to Kalat, and so on through Mekran to the sea. Syad Khan warned him against such an idea. The above episode should, I think, be a warning to us to prevent any Russians from interfering in the direction of the Southern Perso-Baluch frontier and even in Mekran. I have reported some time ago to the Agent to the Governor-General, Quetta, these supposed intentions of Mr. Zarodny. In conversation with Mr. Miller, he remarked how groundless were the sus picions of most Englishmen regarding Russian officials. I at once brought home to him Mr. Zarodny’s action in offering a gun to a paid servant of the English, saying that such actions on the part of would-be naturalists gave me, at any rate, every reason to view Russian actions with suspicion. Mr. Miller, who is always on very friendly terms with me, is fortunately also very nervous in my company. He did not like the thrust, nor did he enjoy being brought to book. He at once answered me that Mr. Zarodny’s action was quite contrary to his advice, that Mr. Zarodny was a man who did not understand politics, etc., and hoped, he said, I would not view Mr. Zarodny’s action as anything but that of a madman, etc. I said £ from what I have seen of Mr. Zarodny, I cannot give him the discredit of being what you say he is,” and I reminded him that Mr. Zarodny’s actions for the future would be looked on by me with the greatest suspicion. I asked him whether, if I brought Mr. Zarodny’s action to the notice of his Government, would they apologize, or recall him. He said he was afraid they would consider the episode as too trivial! He asked whether I had anv suspicions about himself. I said I was not at all sure whether I should not very soon have a case to bring n gainst him. He understood that I meant his recent action with regard to the Sartip, but laughed and said : “ I hope not.” As a matter of fact, when his brother begins to treat the Sartip’s eyes, I shall protest very strongly against his breach of medical etiquette in taking up a case which Ghulam Jelani, the English doctor, has been treating for some months. I shall, too, remind him that the breach will be the more glaring seeing that he has made every use of Ghulam Jelani, both to attend himself and also his Cossacks. Mr. M iller does not at all enjoy cool statements of facts but keeps his temper admirably, while I do not allow such conversation to in any way strain relations. Lord Ronaldshay, who arrived on the 17th December, left here on the 12th January for Birjand. At the time he started we had a spell of intense cold here—a cutting north wind blew, accompanied by rain, and even heavy snow. At night there were sharp frosts. Such cold, I am told, and such rain have not been experienced in Seistan for forty years.3 Lord Eonaldshay liad with him Indian servants, many of them ill-clad; such servants are useless for travelling in the snow and cold of Persia, and give a had name to the country on their return to India. I was averse to Lord Ronaldshay travelling at this time of the year, but he could not spare the time and stay here any longer. The following are a few items of commerical news ichich are suggestive of the future trade prospects of this route. During the past fortnight a caravan of 243 camels arrived here from Eirjand for Quetta. This is the first caravan that has ever left Pirjand for Quetta, they usually go by the Bunder Abbas route. The caravan is excellently equipped. The camels are very fine, and are in charge of an intelligent caravan bashi, Agha Muhammad. This man has travelled to Meshed, Ashkabad and Tehran. He goes, he says, as the pioneer from Birjand, and on his report of the road, and of Quetta, will depend whether’ all the caravans from Birjand, some 6,k00 camels, will abandon the Bundar Abbas route in favour of the Quetta route. Every arrangement has been made in order that his report may be favour able. On August 4th I wrote to Lipton Co., asking them to send a representa tive to Persia to study the tea trade. Prom Calcutta I hear the matter has been referred to England. 4th August.—Wrote to the Egerton TYollen Mills, suggesting that they should send an Agent to Persia. Received no answer. Messrs Elahie Bux, General Merchants, Meerut, inquired about the Seistan route and Persian trade. Their letter was answered fully. 10 th September. — I wrote to the Rosa Sugar Works, suggesting that they should send me samples. This they have done, and it has resulted in many camel-loads of sugar being bought from them by the firm of Muhammad AH Brothers. 10th September — Wrote to the Meerut Soap Co., and have heard that samples of candles have been sent, 'these have not arrived, owing to the impossibility of carrying all the parcels for Seistan by our postal sowars. Wth September. —Addressed the Tirhoot Indigo Planters Association. Have received from them samples of indigo. The samples have been much approved of by Persian dyers. Sent samples of Seistan wool to Messrs. Forbes &amp; Co., Karachi. They have replied that many of their clients are interested in the wool trade, which they wish to attract in place of allowing it go towards Russia. Wrote to the Bombay Chamber of Commerce for an assortment of samples. Each sample to be labelled as I ordered. They have taken great pains and have sent me nearly one hundred samples, which the Birjand traders are anxiously awaiting. '1 hese have not arrived, ai d cannot, as there is no special parcel camel post between here and Quetta, which I hope there will be shortly. Wrote to the Associated Chamber of Commerce, London, asking for samples to form a show-room at Meshed. They have replied that they have printed my letter and distributed it to the various Chambers in England associated with them, also have given it to the press. Suggested to the Cawnpur Chamber of Commerce that they should send a representative. They replied that they would prefer the Persians coming to them, but agreed to pay for the luxury, by granting free railway tickets from Quetta to Cawnpur to such Persians. I have endeavoured to induce the Imperial Bank of Persia to establish a branch here. Their efforts have not been successful. They say the matter must be approached with the utmost caution. After five months’ caution there is no sign of any movement on their part. Meanwhile, great trouble is experienced by traders. I have had to issue barats or cheques, in order to send the revenue4 of Seistan to Meslied, and also on India for the nsc of traders. Several Hindu bankers are I hope soon coming who will undertake the work. I addressed a letter to Sir Jamsetjee Jeejibhoy, Bombay, asking Parsis to come and trade here. He has been very kind in assisting to encourage his com munity. The immediate result is that I have received the following applications for information about trade with Persia by the Seistan route :— Razonatk Vedu Brothers . . Bombay. Noonabhoy Alibhoy . . Karachi, with one lakh capital. Jamshedi .... Bombay. Wrote to Khan Allah Bux, former Attache at Meshed, and asked him to interest his friends in the new trade with Persia ; as a result— Mr. Danjibhoy, the well-known tonga agent, writes to say he has serious intentions of starting this trade with a large capital. Mr. Nusserwanji Jamasjee, of the firm of Jamasjee &amp; Co., writes for i nformation, saying he has large capital and intends sending a trial caravan ; his firm have dealings in China, Japan, besides all over India. Mr. Makunjee, son of the late Mamoojee, house proprietor in Rawalpindi, writes for information, saying he has a lakh of capital to put into the business. Addressed a letter to Messrs. Ralli Brothers, but have as yet received no reply. Among applications and inquiries about tea, the following tea companies have either sent me samples or show an inclination to press their trade to wards Persia:— Bundla Tea Company, Palampur ; Holta Tea Company ; Tea Company» Assam; Arcadia Tea Estate, Debra Dun; Debra Dun Tea Association, etc. Captain Webb-Ware visited Shikarpur to induce traders to come to Persia- The result has been applications from Tikam Singh, Kihal Singh and Lalaram Guidass. Among various other applicants are— Uttam Chand, Bar Mukand and Ludhiana dealers in lungis, shawls, etc., Messrs. Grossman, Calcutta. To all these applicants 1 have written long and detailed letters. Messrs Reyhart, Hull, England, have noted to me that they are sending their representative Mr Goodier to Scistan in March to buy wool, asking particulars about the Nushki route, a way they would prefer using to that through Russia at present used by them. Have addressed a letter to Mr. Cazaleh, London, one of the directors of perhaps the biggest firm of general merchants in Russia (English), suggesting that it may be possible to introduce land borne tea into Russia from India in competition with the Chinese caravan tea. Seth Suleiman here of the firm of Muhammad Ali Brothers, reports that during six months he sold 50 camel-loads of green tea at Birjand to Afghans, and could now sell over 100 camel-loads of tea had he got it. The following are items of news I have received from Birjand through the Agent of Muhammad Ali Brothers, who has a shop there :— Letter, dated 12th December 1900, states that Rs. 8,550 have been received by their firm in exchange for “ barats ” or cheques on India for the purchase of English goods; also that if the British Government will issue cheques on India, merchants from Sabzewa/ Yezd and Meshed would avail themselves of the convenience. The total value of the Kafila, with Agha Khan caravan hash! (referred to at the beginning of these notes) is 79,474 krans, equalling about £1,590. Colonel Temple reports that a rich Herati hanker from Meshed is sending his Agent to Seistan, for the transaction/necessitated by the Herat caravans St making use of this route. ' ' / Of Russian trading agents there is not a sign. The Russian Consul informs me that there has been no result from the meeting held at Nigni Yovgorod last August and referred to by the British5 Consul, Batoum. British goods in the hands of some of the merchants above- mentioned will shortly very seriously compete with Kussian goods, not in Seistan where Russia cannot compete, but all over Persia. Our commercial prospects may, I think, be taken as a good set-off to any hitch or even success which the Russians may score over the visit of the Sartip to India. G. CHENEYIX-TRENCH, Major, Eer Britannic Majesty's Consul, Seistan, / *-'Or ( Enclosure in Foreign Office letter of 25th January 1901 .) Enclosures of Political and Secret Department letter No. 5 , dated the 1 st February 1901 . CONFIDENTIAL. Memorandum by Mr. C. Bigham on the Upper Valley of the Yang-tsze Kiang and the Provinces immediately beyond its Northern Watershed. The following Memorandum has for its object a general examination of the Upper Valley of the Yang-tsze Kiang from the commercial and political point of view, some remarks being added on the economic and strategical con ditions of the provinces immediately beyond its northern watershed. In this connection the existing and future lines of traffic and the possible railway routes, as well as the prospects of British trade, direct, or resulting from the development of Chinese resources, industry and communications, are briefly discussed ; while some attention is paid to the defensible frontiers of the Empire and of the British sphere of influence. The information here submitted to Her Majesty’s Government is the result of seven months’ travel in the interior of China Proper, comprising, firstly, a journey from Canton to Peking, by way of Hankow, through the provinces of Kwantung and Kiangsi to the south, and Hupeh and Honan to the north of the Yang-tsze Kiang; secondly, an ascent of the river from its mouth at Shanghai to Chungking, and thence to Kiating and Chengtu, the head of navigation, with an excursion further west to the foot of the Tibetan Mountains ; and, thirdly, a land journey north-east from Chengtu to Peking, by way of the Tsingling Mountains, Singanfu, the Tungkuan Portress, and the Yellow Biver; the distance traversed in each case being about 2,000 miles. Valuable assistance has been obtained from Her Majesty’s Consuls along the line of route, from the various British officers and engineers who have latterly been engaged in surveying or prospecting the country, from the missionaries of several nations, and from those Chinese who had the ability and the will to give it; while the study of the literature bearing on the questions considered has contributed material aid. In these journeys, although time has not allowed the collection of statistics, or the detailed observance of the actual articles required by the inland markets, I have been generally impressed by the accuracy of the reports published from time to time by such of Her Majesty’s Consuls as have travelled in the interior, especially those of Messrs. Hosie, Bourne and Litton. The prices of labour and transport do not appear to have altered very much since the days of Baron von Bichthofen, Mr. Baber, and Captain Blakiston, nor does the standard of comfort seem to have greatly changed. In Szechuan I remarked more and in Honan less opium-smoking and early marriage than was formerly the case, and in Hunan the state of feeling is improved. Shensi is certainly the most backward and the poorest province I have visited, and its capital, Singanfu, is losing in wealth and importance every year. The excellence and cheapness of the majority of the goods made by the Chinese for their own consumption especially struck me, and the immense possibilities for mining and manufacturing, and the ubiquitous need of steam communication were always evident, the inference being that there were better prospects at present for exploiting and the export trade than for imports.2 The population, though very curious, I found as a rule quiet and well disposed, even in the larger towns, and this opinion is endorsed by the Protestant missionaries; the higher officials were invariably courteous and afforded me the usual facilities. Of the machinations of the French, whether Consular, Catholic, or commercial, I heard hut little, and from conversations with those functionaries and priests that I met, and a perusal of the French colonial press, I gathered that the local policy was one of words rather than deeds, and that any solid enterprise was equally remote from the intentions and the interests, if not the desires, of the Paris Government. In the north there was even less to he seen of the Russians, although it had been confidently asserted in Hankow that goods from Moscow and officers from St. Petersburgh encumbered the streets of Singanfu. On my arrival there I was informed that there was a shop where formerly a little Russian cloth could be bought, while a solitary traveller, judged from his language wffiich no one understood, to be a Russian, had passed through a year before. This was the foundation of the rumour. As regards the Japanese, their goods are in most places, though they are not otherwise to the fore. The Viceroys of Hunan and Hupeh, and of Szechuan, both have political leanings towards them, and have engaged one or two as instructors for their troops, but this appears to be the measure of their influence. Finally, I found no signs of the Lu Han Railway, or of the Peking Syndicate in North Honan, while the only foreign imports I saw there were Japanese and American. In this Memorandum the Yang-tsze Kiang, as a navigable river, is con sidered as starting from Chengtu, the capital of Szechuan, and the Kinsha Kiang is treated as an affluent; Hankow is taken to mark the limit of the upper and lower valleys, and the British “ sphere of influence ” is assumed to include, in addition to the geographical catchment area of the river, those pro vinces defined as pertaining to it by Mr. Brodrick in the House of Commons. The map used is that by Bretschneider, and the provinces chiefly dealt with are Hupeh, Hunan, Szechuan, Honan, and Shensi. By way of preface, the general aspect of the country will be reviewed, the particular provinces will then be examined in more detail, and, finally, the existing situation will be summarised. An endeavour will be made, in pre senting the political and commercial features of the territories under consider ation, to preserve their unity and, at the same time, to show their relation to British interests. China Proper, more usually called the Eighteen Provinces, has been by nature divided into two parts, which are economically, as they are geologically, distinct. Richthofen terms them “Loess and Non-Loess China”—for loess, the sandy loam which the Chinese call “ hoangtu ”, or yellow earth, and which covers, without any exceptions, the northerly of these two portions, and is no less conspicuous by its absence in the south, has been the ultimate cause of the physical and the social conditions which distinguish the one region from the other. Starting from the east coast, the line of separation—which is also that between the bread and the rice-eating population—follows the Lower Yang-tsze in a westerly direction to Hankow, whence it goes north-west up the Han River and its tributary, the Tan, to the Tsingling Mountains: there it turns west, and, following first this range and subsequently that of the Kuen Lun, finally terminates on the grasslands and plateaux of Tibet. China is thus almost bisected, and although there are parts to the south where loess is found, and, similarly, districts lacking it in the north, the line indicated is, for all practical purposes, exact. The characteristics of the country and the inhabitants, the methods of agriculture and trade, and the state of prosperity and enlightenment3 in these two divisions are so salient, so different and so important, that they should he continually borne in mind, for the vast influence due to them in the past must act, though probably in a less exaggerated degree, in the future. Before attempting, however, to describe the leading traits of “ loess and non loess China”, it is necessary to notice the formation itself, which is primarily responsible for their existence. Loess is a friable earth, quite unstratified, and is “ the residue of the inorganic matter of plants deposited during continual ages on the prairies that originally constituted Northern China”, of which it now forms the entire superficies, with the exception of some of the mountains of Shantung and the alluvial bottomlands of rivers. More widely spread and more highly developed here than of any other part of the globe, its prominent properties are at once more powerful and can be more easily observed than elsewhere. These are, firstly, its eminent fertility, for though very porous and requiring more constant rains than other soil, it needs no manure and but little cultivation; and, secondly, its vertical cleavage, which, while providing cave dwellings and peculiar facilities for terracing, opposes, to a people ignorant of engineering, an almost insuperable bar to efficient communications. With the exception of the Great Plain, that stretches from the centre of Honan to the sea, the loess country, cut up into sandy ravines and nullas, affords no natural roads, and presents extreme difficulties to their construction and maintenance. The rivers, their beds choked with the loam brought down by denudation and their precipitous banks so eroded as often not to admit of a path along them, are nearly all wide, shallow, and unfit for navigation, while the absence of a proper channel in the freshet season entails disastrous floods or expensive embankments. The condition of the Northern Provinces can easily be deduced, and corre sponds with the facts. Excluding one or two roads, built long ago for the needs of strategy rather than commerce, and in a bad state of repair, and one or two inconsiderable rivers of uncertain navigability, there is an absolute lack of proper transport routes, and this has rapidly brought other evils in its train. Although the Northern Provinces are nearly all rich in coal, some immensely so, it could not be cheaply supplied beyond its own localities, and the necessity of fuel having speedily consumed all the available wood, a systematic deforest ation set in. This, begun more than a thousand years ago and now almost complete, has given “ loess China ” the arid and cheerless aspect so tedious to the traveller, and has so checked the rainfall and deteriorated the climate that, were the soil not unusually prolific, the country would be a desert. The easi ness of labour and cheapness of habitations induced early marriage and, in many places, congested population, while latterly opium-smoking got a firm hold on an unoccupied peasantry. Floods and famines are as frequent as they are destructive in such regions, which, by the accidents of history, have been also continually subjected to the devastations of rebellion, and thus afford a striking object-lesson to a student pf Malthus. Primarily an agricultural country, the north has neither the means of sending its cereals and cotton to the provinces that would take them nor of exploiting and distributing the coal it needs itself. Its primitive iron and cloth industries cannot compete in South China with the imports from abroad, nor has it any exports wherewith to buy foreign goods. In consequence it has few large trade centres or capitalists (for the Shansi bankers do their business in the south), and is alike ignored by the Chinese and the outside market, while the geographical isolation of its greater part tends to accentuate its present state, which must continue until the advent of railways. Some communications do exist in its maritime provinces and in the Great Plain, which, however, has no coal and no seaport, but the other bad conditions obtain. In the interior, self-supporting and out of touch with the rest of the Empire, the case is worse. Poverty, apathy, and decay are universally manifest, and though the utilisation of the enormous potential resources of the earth may soon restore material prosperity, moral regeneration can only follow with time.4 Turning to the south the scene changes at once, and with it the chief economic features of life. Loess is replaced by soft, red sandstone, interspersed with limestone rocks a less fertile soil, for which constant irrigation and, therefore, constant labour are necessary. Navigable waterways are abundant for, besides the great river itself, which for 2,000 miles is the main artery of commerce, there are its major affluents, the Kan, the Han, and the Siang (which can all be ascended to their head-waters), and a number of minor tributaries. Further south the Canton system drains the two Kwang Provinces and extends beyond their borders, and the rest of the seaboard is no less adequately served.. Deforestation, while not so general as in the north, does not exercise much influence on a well-watered country dependent on irrigation ; coal or rice, in times of famine, can he easily and inexpensively conveyed from long distances by means of water transit; floods are infrequent, and opium- smoking is, to some extent, counteracted by employment and education, its two most able foes. Emigrants reduce the surplus population, and where a living is not obtainable on land it can usually be gained on the rivers; indeed, to the inhabitants of some provinces the rival claims of the “ boats” and the “fields” appear as nicely balanced as they do to the budding Etonian. Finally, Non- Loess China—-its great cities in contact with foreign trade for over a century has, by its tea and silk and by its purchase of goods from abroad, at once acquired wealth and knowledge and developed intelligence and energy. With the exception of the three south-western provinces (Kwangsi, Kui-'chow, and Yunnan), which are still under-populated and little known, there is a far hioffler average of comfort and enlightenment diffused here than in the north. Li?in' is.relatively cheaper ; the people are, as a rule, quieter and more settled and^ with a single reservation, thq evils of misgovernment and rebellion have been less acutely felt. In brief, we see. to the north a grain-eating, cotton-producing region immensely rich m minerals, but without proper communications, in an isolated and decadent state; to the south, a rice-eating, tea and silk-producing countrv d'Fo°^ r ^ VerSj ^ ouc ^ exterior, and generally in a'prosperous These being the essential differences between Loess and Non-Loess China the importance of the Valley of the Yang-tase Kiang is at once apparent’ Embracing portions of both divisions, with an area of 650,000 square miles and a population of at least 180,000,000, it mediates most of the traffic contains the majority of the buying-and-selling elements, and has become the repository of wealth of the Empire. Its magnificent waterway, crossing the entire country, from west to east and draining parts of twelve provinces controls, the avenues as it connects the emporia of commerce, and the power predominant on it, established at the centre of resistance and secure from external attack, may direct the destinies of the Chinese people. . The lower basin of the river, which has been frequently and comprehen sively reported on by Her Majesty’s Consuls, is now comparatively well known to commercial enterprise, especially since, under the new Regulations, steam navigation has commenced on the inland waters. West of Hankow however, Her Majesty’s Government is only represented on the Yan^-tsze Kiang by two officials m esse and two in posse, whose multifarious duties''con fining them to their ports preclude any very extended travel in the interior • hut the magnitude of British interests in the upper valley is, perhaps greater than m any other part of China, and a particular consideration of the individual provinces may accordingly be of some use. Hupeh (population 22,000,000) consists of portions both of loess and of non-loess country. The former leads to the Great Plain, and closely resembles Honan; the latter, with the exception of the Han Valley, is made up of lakes marshes, and mountains, and is sparsely inhabited. The Han, which is navi gable for steamers to Laohokou (460 miles) and for small junks to Hanchun^ (1,200 miles), waters a populous agricultural region, and affords (1) the only5 i existing route by which British goods now find their way into the North- Western Provinces, and (2) the best practicable line for a railway into Szechuan. (1) As regards the former, which goes up the Han and Tan Eivers to Jvintzekuan and thence over the mountains to Singanfu, it has maintained its position, despite the heavy li-kin exactions all along it, from the fact of its having only, five days (150 miles) of land portage, which costs on an average twenty to thirty times as much as water transport. It would probably be un able to compete with the railway entering Shensi from the east under the present conditions; but with a station of the Imperial Maritime Customs established at Kintzekuan the trade would be materially relieved, while the considerable revenues, which now enrich a few local officials rather than the Provincial Treasury, would be deflected to Peking. (2) A railway to Szechuan could follow the river from Laohokou to Tzeyang or Hanchung, the one 290 and the other 230 miles in a straight line from Chengtu. Its advantages are that it would pass through easy and fertile country for four-fifths of the way, while the passes of the Tapa-shan do not rise above 4,000 feet and are not difficult. Though it might not take much of the direct Szechuan trade, it would have the Han Valley to draw on, and would carry the wool from South Kansuh, and should it be built, a branch might be added to Kintzekuan and Singanfu, which should do much to revive that city by developing its trade with Hankow and Chengtu. But the con struction of this branch would be expensive, and, as an isolated undertaking, a doubtful speculation. The chief feature of Hupeh, however, is the treaty port of Hankow, which, with the contiguous cities of Wuchang and Hanyang, bids fair to become the London of China. The seat of a Viceroy, the centre of the tea trade, and the limit of ocean-going steamers, it has already a population of close on a million, and as the prospective junction of the trunk lines from Peking and Canton will become, on their completion, the commercial focus of the Empire, and receive a vast accession of importance. Should the present dynasty ever be induced to alter the seat of Government, now that the raison d'etre of Peking has dis appeared with the control over Manchuria, Hankow could well be advocated as a new metropolis. Nanking is too exposed, Chengtu too remote, and Singanfu untenable against a Power that commands the approaches from Central Asia ; but Hankow, 600 miles from the sea and close to the loyal province of Hunan, might well, by its central position and its affluence, inspire the most reforming monarch or tempt the most reactionary Court. Hunan (21,000,000) is about equally divided between hills and alluvial land, the former lying to the west and the latter occupying the valleys of the Siang and Yuen Bivers. It produces coal and tea, and buys cotton and piece-goods, but of its waterways, the Siang alone can be ascended by launches, and that not beyond Siangtan (150 miles). This city, which formerly received and distributed the Canton overland trade, has rapidly diminished in wealth and population (now about 300,000) since tiie Yang-tsze has been navigated by steam, but the railway should restore its prosperity. Changsha, the provincial capital and the home of the literati, and Changte, where some missionaries have recently got a footing, are both large cities; but Yochow, the new treaty port, though its situation at the entrance to the Tungting Lake appears commanding, does not seem to have any brilliant future, for it has a bad anchorage, and the Shipping Companies have decided that Hankow is a better place to break bulk for goods to and from the interior. The Hunan Bailway, which is to run from Hankow by Changsha and the Siang to the Cheling Pass (1,000 feet), and thence by Shaochou and the North Biver to Canton, will probably insure the opening of Siangtan—the project has already been mooted among the local Chinese merchants—and this will still further modify the importance of Yochow.6 The prospects of this Canton-IIankow line are exceedingly good. It will connect two great ports, follow an existing and popular trade route, and pass through the finest and by far the most accessible coal-fields in Southern China. The anthracite of the Liu mines (to which His Excellency Changchitung is already building a tramway from the Liu River), and the bituminous coal on the Siang, though not of the same excellence as the products of the Honan or Shansi mines, are both of good quality and easily extracted, and even now supply most of the Viceroyalty. No other railways appear likely ; the road by Kweiyang to Yunnan, and that by Changte to Chungking were recently respect ively examined by Captain Wingate and Captain Watts Jones, R.E., and both were deemed impracticable. The Hunanese are, as a rule, w T ell-to-do, and their character is worthy of some attention. The countryfolk are believed to be, and perhaps in consequence really are, somewhat braver and more independent than the rest of the Chinese people. Physically they are strong and active, and under proper training might be formed into efficient soldiers. The educated classes who furnish a large proportion of the best Mandarins of the Empire, are noted for their fervent “ patriotism”, which, having latterly become rather “pro-Chinese’’ than anti- foreign, is now identifying itself w r ith reform. Their political influence is considerable and might, by judicious management, be turned to some account in the formation of public opinion. Szechuan, the largest and richest province in China, contains about 45,000,000 of people. Accurate statistics are almost impossible to procure, but the best and most recent authorities support this figure rather than the more startling estimates that are not infrequently seen in the newspapers. Although the centre is very densely populated, vast tracts on the northern and western frontiers are almost destitute of inhabitants. In like manner the populations of the chief cities have been much exaggerated. Chengtu, Chungking, and Tzeliojin, the centre of the salt wells district, each holds some half-a-million souls, but no other place approaches them in size. The Chengtu Plain, which supports nearly four millions and concentrates much wealth and power, is exceptional, and its prosperity and fertility by no means extend over the whole province. The general configuration of Szechuan is as follows: In the midst a collection of innumerable hills and valleys draining to the south and usually denominated the Red Basin, the limits of wffiich are roughly marked by the main stream of the Yang-tsze and lines joining Suchow, Yachow% Mao and Wan. All round this depression is a mountain rim, 5,000 or 6,000 feet high to the south and east, and double that altitude to the north and west. In the Red Basin, the Yang-tsze and the affluents to its left bank, connected by winding stone paths and handsome covered bridges, supply a remarkable net work of communications. The well-watered valleys chequered with fields of silver, red and green, dotted with farms and relieved by wooded hills, present a most attractive landscape; while an admirable system of irrigation, in a country that is by no means naturally fertile, testifies at once to the genius and the labour of its inhabitants. The chief centres of commerce are Chengtu, the capital, Chungking, the Treaty and shipping port, Tzeliojin for salt, Kiating for silk and white wax, Ningyuen and Suchow for metals, and Yachow and Tasienlu for the Tibetan trade. The musk and medicines that constitute the latter, and the wool of the Amdon pasture lands, as well as a large proportion of the minerals from Northern Yunnan and Kuichow—chiefly zinc, quicksilver, and lead—come to Suchow (Suifu) and Chungking; and when the rich copper mines of the Kienchang Valley are properly exploited, their output will follow the same route. The iron and coal which are also found in Szechuan, the former plentifully and the latter more rarely, are not of sufficiently good quality for export. Imports from abroad are not yet very great. Cotton, cloth, kerosene oil, and small articles, such as matches, are the most in demand. There is, however, a vast and ready\ \ &lt; 7 field for British goods, the people being able and willing to buy. All the cities, with the exception of Tasienlu, are situate in the Red Basin or its offshoot, the Kienchang Valley, which comprise the present producing and future buyin^ districts of the province. J ° The Chinese in Szechuan, though soft and much addicted to opium-smoking, are a quiet, industrious, and law-abiding people. They are well disposed to foreigners and are without doubt cleaner, better mannered, and better dressed than in any other part of the Empire. Judging from a European point of view their cities show no little elegance and refinement, their public buildings com bine solidity with some degree of art, while their country houses are frequently spacious and picturesque. Possessing some idea of luxury they appreciate Western manufactures, and their desire to increase their riches may lead them to adopt Western methods. The “ barbarians/’or tribesmen who inhabit the northern, western, and southern mountains, also deserve some notice. They fall into two main cate gories : (1) The Sifan and Mantze, wdio present in varying degrees an admixture of Chinese and Tibetan blood, and are evidently of Mongol origin. They are tributary to the Government, in social and trading relations with the civilised community, and have been described by several travellers. (2) The Lolos, who inhabit an independent territory of their own to the south. They are particularly interesting as being the only white people speaking a yellow language. According to Bons d’Anty they are of Caucasian stock— “ Le rameau brun de la race blanche”—and former immigrants from the Himalayas. The blue-eyed, fair-haired type is still to be met amongst them, but their tongue is akin to Bur man and no roots cognate to Sanskrit can be traced. Their polity is patriarchal, and their chief occupation appears to be brigandage and waging war upon each other and the Chinese, to whom they attach considerable value as slaves. Their country has accordingly been declared by the Government, with equal discretion and truth, to be always in the “ grosse Belagerungszustand ”. All these tribes, though not, I believe, the Miaotze, or “ aborigines ”, wdio are found in Kwangsi and Kuichow, are hardy and courageous mountaineers, as superior to the Chinese in bravery as they are in strength, and would probably afford excellent material for troops. It now remains to examine the question of communications : firstly, with the exterior; and, secondly, inside the province. After a careful study of the different routes by wdiich Szechuan can be entered, I am convinced that the Yang-tsze Kiang is by so far the chief and natural highway that it must eventually displace all others and monopolise nine-tenths of the traffic. To start with, no railway can ever compete with it as regards exports, for the freight down stream, which is now less than nothing, the men who tracked up paying for the privilege of rowing dow r n and only getting their food, must always remain extraordinarily low with a current averaging 5 knots an hour the whole way from Chungking to Ichang. A line up the Han, the only other practicable entry from the seaboard, might carry imports; but the imports to Szechuan from the east are all comparatively cheap and bulky articles, while its additional mileage would only emphasise this dis advantage. This is not deprecating its construction, which has been alluded to above, but merely demonstrating that it could only be supplementary to the Yang-tsze Kiang. The other approaches from the sea, i.e., the land road from Ichang, that from Hunan to Chungking, the Great North Road from Singanfu, and the southern route from Canton and Kuichow are impracticable from an engineering stand-point, and pass through wild, desolate, and poverty-stricken countries. The same objections apply to the mountain tracks from Kansuh, and still more so to those from Tibet. We are relegated, therefore, to the Y unnan side, that is to say to a line from either Tonquin or British India.8 Commercially, France and her Colony have hut few interests to develop or defend in Szechuan, for the rice and silk connection is mainly confined to the coast; and since the opening of the West River and the consequent attraction of the Southern Yunnan and Kwangsi trade to Canton, most of the prospects of a railway from Hanoi to the north, which can now only look to mining support, have disappeared; while its construction would he most costly. Poli tically, French influence is almost limited to the Catholic propaganda, which are, however, neither so identical with it, nor so widely spread as is generally supposed. The priests have certainly a considerahle number of adherents, but being without funds and disliked by the Mandarins on account of their inter ference in local matters and assumed official rank, their power is pretty well on a par with their popularity. For these reasons and those stated before, the idea of a line from Tonquin to Szechuan may be regarded as highly improbable. Finally, a railway from Assam or Burma must be in any case an arduous undertaking and one unlikely to pay for some time, though there is no doubt that it would promote British prestige and commerce. There are several possible routes from the valleys of the Irawaddy or Bramhaputra across the Yunnan Plateau, but it is not proposed to discuss them here, in view of the fact that Her Majesty’s Government is already in possession of the technical reports of those officers who have recently being employed in their examination. As regards the interior, the natural indication is a main line from Chengtu to Chungking, by way of Kiating and Tzeliojin, with branches to Kuan and Yachow ; for, besides passing the most populous and richest cities, and connecting the capital of the province with its port, it would have cheap coal all along its route. The undulating country presents some minor difficulties owing to the alterations in levels, and the land is comparatively dear, but once built, a railway should rapidly realise very large profits. It appears, then, that British interests in Szechuan may best be served by the bettering of communications, the first and most important item of which is to facilitate and promote in every way the steam navigation of the Upper Yang-tsze Kiang. On this really depends the thorough opening and indeed the commercial future of the whole province. Any outlay on the survey of the rapids by experts, and on the subsequent execution of the blasting or other operations they might recommend, would not, I believe, be false economy for Her Majesty’s or for the Chinese Government. In addition, the river between Hankow and Ichang should be properly buoyed and lighted, and the permission to tow barges accorded, both matters for the Imperial Maritime Customs, who receive large tonnage dues. Some opposition to steamers to Chungking might be expected from the established Companies, as their “ chartered junk business w T ould suffer, while the increase of cargo in proportion to transport would probably bring in new competitors and break their ring ; but the general benefits to British trade would be incalculable. At the same time, the acquirement of new Treaty ports (Chengtu, Kiating, and Suchow, for preference), the maintenance of a certain display of lorce on the Upper River, and the encouragement of railway enterprise, are of hardly less necessity and almost equal value. Honan (24,000,000) drains partly to the Yang-tsze and partly to the Yellow River. Most of the former portion consists of the Great Plain and the Han Valley, its remainder is a mountainous region to the west. In the latter and northern third of the province, wdiich includes all the navigable course of the Yellow River, the loess conditions are strongly pronounced. Cotton and grain form the crops, the roads are few and bad, the population poor and very dense. Here,'however, and in the adjoining districts of Shanshi, are located the richest coal and iron-fields of China, the former being among the largest and best in the world. Their potential w r orth is enormous, and, if we accept Rousseau’s theory that iron and corn are the great civilisers of humanity, we may expect to see Northern Honan, where all three abound, become, in time, the socialist, as it will certainly be the manufacturing centre of China. F or9 the latter, the only necessities are proper working and proper communications. The best mines, of which the Peking Syndicate holds the concession, lie on the left bank of the Yellow River, extending from Chingwa to Tsiyuen in Shansi, and are undoubtedly the most valuable known asset of China. Any line from here to the south must pass through country where coal could be sold at every station and it seems urgent that such a line, under British auspices, should be built at once, and the power of a prohibitory tariff not left to the Lu Han Rail way. We have no trade in these parts at present, and can look for none, except as following the development of industry; but having established a position which, by timely strengthening, may be made the nucleus of our commercial, no less than our political influence in the north, it seems vital to utilise it. The Lu Han Railway having already taken the north and south route, the next best line would be diagonally from Honan-fu to Nanking, for it would tap an easy and populous grain country, greatly in need of coal throughout its length Honan-fu would, of course, be itself directly connected with the Chino'wa coal-fields, and branch lines to Tungkuan and Shensi, and. by way of the Juchow mines and the Nankau Pass to the Han, could be profitably added. The minor rivers of Honan do not require much consideration, for they are only navigable near the limits of the province. No improvements are ever likely to make the Yellow River really serviceable, owing to the nature of the surrounding country, and the best that can be hoped for is to check its powers of destruction. At present it is practicable, when not in flood, for clumsy and ponderous boats of 1 foot draught between Kaifong and Honan-fu, a distance of 120 miles. These are the two chief cities of the province : the former, which was once the home of the Chinese Jews, being its capital, and the latter, which is the junction of the roads to the west, its cotton mart; but their aspect is desolate, life in them is stagnant, and they evince few signs of affluence or progress. Shensi (8,000,000) consists of two distinct natural divisions, separated by the range of the Tsinglingshan. The southern third contains the valley of the Upper Han, and is closely allied in formation and products to Szechuan. Its only big city is Hanchung, and its trade routes have been already discussed. The northern, and by far the more extensive portion of the province is a loess country, and is, politically and geographically, in close relation with Kansuh. This is due to the fact that, shut in to the south and east by mountains, and to the north bv the inhospitable wastes of Mongolia, its interests and commerce have been always directed to the west. Since the Taiping. and Muhammadan rebellions, cultivation has been mainly confined to the basin of the Wei River, which alone in the province is navigable, and that for only 140 miles. Its capital and distributing centre is Singan-fu (500,000), which, once the metropolis of the Empire, still recalls by its massive walls and gates, no less than by its famous Nestorian tablet, the civilisation of the. dynasties that erected them. Here converge all the existing roads, and to this rather than to any industry or wealth is due the prominence that the city still retains. The peculiar configuration of Northern China admits of only one piactieable approach from the east to the west. This is that by the Tungkuan Fortress, which, situated at the great bend of the Yellow River, commands the narrow passage between two mountain systems. At Tungkuan, which has been called, with some reason, the Gate of Central Asia, the road from .Peking, and e north meets that from Honan-fu and the east, and, continuing to Smgan- u, where it joins the Laohokou trail from the south, again bifurcates, one branc i going to Szechuan and Tibet and the other to Kansuh and Turkistan. (T ere is, indeed, another crossing 20 miles higher up the river, at Taikmgkuan, ut i is strategically commanded by and dependent on the lower garrison, and e position for military purposes can be considered as one.) Of the two roads mentioned, that to Kansuh and Turkistan is. by far the most important, for it has mediated since the days of Byzantium and Rome the trade of Europe with the Extreme Orient, and still aflords the on ^10 feasible route for a railway into China from Central Asia. Such a colosal undertaking would only enter into the purview of one European ^Government, but being 'now needless to its strategy or commerce, both already better provided for on the north-east, its inception may be regarded as distant. Nevertheless, that section of it that would traverse the alluvial land of the 'VYei Valley, from Tungkuan to Singan-fu, and on to Tsinchow, in Kansuh, is a reasonable and might well be a profitable line. It would encourage agricul ture and colonisation in the north-west, attract the wool that now goes through Mongolia, and, connected with Ilonan-fu, supply in return the coal and iron that are now tediously hauled up the river or expensively transported by cart. At the same time, it should promote the foreign trade. The bulk of this latter, which is not very large, follows at present the Laohokou route, previously described, though some American, Japanese, and Russian piece-goods (the latter about 10 per cent of the whole) come via Tientsin and Honan. The general impression in Shensi is one of poverty and decay, and though the inherent recuperative force of the people and the soil insensibly struggle against retrogression, they are hampered by natural conditions and past history, and need extraneous and'artificial assistance to restore them to prosperity. Having now completed the examination of those provinces which it was proposed to review, an attempt will be made to summarise their existing commercial and political prospects, and in connection with the latter to briefly consider the military situation. Most of the chief trade requirements have been already enumerated, and it is unnecessary to recapitulate them in detail. Improved communications are the first thing, and in this respect the needs of the north appear more press ing than those of the south. But it is in the latter part of China that we must look for our greatest present and future trade. Here we have a long-established lead in a rich market to which we can carry our goods ourselves. Here we can sell the articles we manufacture and purchase those we desire, and here our merchants can find both steady and growing profits, and can turn over their money quickly. Here then we should concentrate our attention on the development of our commerce and of those arteries on which it primarily depends. The north is for the moment rather the sphere for capitalists. Railways are a sine qua non, for the country must be exploited before it can be expected to buy. But the increased demand for labour and the rise in wages, consequent on new industries, must soon introduce new wants. The necessity here is to be first in the field and also to lower our prices. The protectionist Companies holding concessions may go to their own countries for men and material, but as the Chinese come in they will go to the cheapest market, and it is essential that that should be our market. The Chinaman is a bad economist, and the condition that outweighs all others in his eyes, whether he wants a general manager, a locomotive or a yard of sheeting is cheapness, quality being a minor consideration. In the old days it was different; there was only one sort of cloth to be bought. It w as British, and he took it or left it at its own price. Now there are three or four sorts : some certainly superior to others, but there is also a difference in cost, and with him that is the decisive factor. This was early recognised and acted on by our rivals, and if we hope to play a leading part in the future import trade of North and, indeed, of South China, whether in skilled labour, machinery, or piece-goods, it is incumbent on us to do the same. Adaptability to circumstances is a law of existence. Among minor recommendations— (1) The establishment of some institution at Hongkong or Shanghai, analogous to that at Vladivostock, w^here commercial agents could learn the language, wdth a Trade Bureau for the collection of statistics and study of the inland market: and (2) The organisation of Joint Stock Companies on the German plan in union with native merchants would do much to attract capital and energy.11 (3) The consolidation under a charter of the various British Syndicates, particularly those concerned with the railways of Hunan, Yunnan, Szechuan, and Honan, would materially augment their financial security, and at the same time cement the political influence of Her Majesty’s Government. But all such schemes must derive mainly from private initiative, and though the improvement of the Upper Yang-tsze might well be made a public undertaking, the great questions of cheaper imports, railways, and mining will depend ultimately on the interest taken in China by the working classes of England. There are, however, broader issues involved. The Chinese Empire, from its possession of unlimited raw material and cheap labour, the prime element of cost in all production, must in the future compete with, if it does not outrival, the present economic superiority of the West. The control of these resources and this population by a protectionist Power might menace the commercial peace of England, just as their subjuga tion to military despotism has in the past imperilled the political existence of Europe, and to guard against such a danger is only self-defence. Although our command of the carrying trade of the Ear East, and the fact that our language has become its language of commerce, are both great advantages, they are not enough. Political predominance is also necessary, r or this influence at the seat of Government is, of course, the first requisite, but influence in the provinces is not to be despised. The Viceroys, though not enjoying the independence of the great Indian satraps a century ago, are nevertheless very powerful, far more so for instance than the present Turkish Valis. They have their so-called armies and arsenals, their own mints and treasuries, and their separate judicial and administrative systems. At their Courts the li-kin is collected, and the Railway and Mining concessions not infrequently granted, for the “ confirmation” at Peking often depends not a little on their recommeudations. It would therefore seem advisable to endeavour to increase our influence in the provinces by having Consular Representatives at each Viceregal capital. Most of the higher officials on the Yang-tsze Kiang are by no means impervious to the utility of foreign ideas and methods, though still timid, and the necessity of conciliating a variety of conflicting minor interests is, as a rule, their main difficulty in admitting foreign enterprise. The plea advanced is that “ the people are not ready for it ”. There are numerous indications that this is not the case. To cite a few : dollars, called “ foreign money ”, already go all over South-Eastern China and Manchuria, and. are deservedly popular; inquiries are continually being made by both Mandarins and merchants as to how and where they can get their sons taught English ; and the praises of, and desire for, the “ fire wheel cart” and the “ fire wheel boat” are almost universal, the people beginning to recognise that the dislocated labour will adjust itself. Considerable secular use could also be made of the British missionaries who are scattered all over the Empire and are the real pioneers of enlighten ment. They are, as a rule, in possession of or in the way of obtaining extra ordinarily accurate information as to the state of the country and the feeling of the people, and would, in nine cases out of ten, be only too willing to impart it to Her Majesty’s Government. But all political predominance is finally founded on the ultima ratio regum, and a necessary corollary to it is a control of the military situation. The naval supremacy of Great Britain precluding any serious invasion of &gt; China by a Power based on the sea, only one remains that can threaten her by land; but the position of this Power is peculiarly strong. Without pausing to discuss the Asiatic policy of Russia, her great mission of the civilisation and conversion, or rather the Russification of the Eastern nations, which, dear to the statesman and the soldier, attractive to the educated proletariat and specious to the lower classes, is perhaps necessary subjectively to the Empire itself, it12 may be assumed that there will he a continual tendency on her part to terri torial aggrandisement in the south. The fact that the vast territories of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Turkistan lie open to attack, and that no Power either would or could defend them, is only an additional incentive. A Government then interested in the reform or the defence of China must consider— (1) What is her best defensible frontier; and (2) What means exist for giving her an effective army. The question of the retention against attack of the outlying dominions of China may be speedily dismissed. Manchuria, crossed by Russian railways and flanked by her fortresses, is no longer tenable. The deserts and prairies of Mongolia and the distant steppes of Turkistan could only be defended by whole sale devastation. The forcible entry of Tibet from the north hardly comes into the range of practical strategy, and its occupation by Chinese garrisons is even less probable. Hated alike by the Yellow Llamas and the Tibetan people, the Peking Government has few interests beyond its limited trade relations and its partiality for buffer States to bind it to a country where its suzerainty is almost nominal, and of which its fear is commensurate with its ignorance. But the curtailment from the Empire of these huge and inaccessible dependencies, inhabited by alien races, would be rather a source of strength than of weakness, for attention and force could be the more easily concentrated on the defence of the Middle Kingdom, its population, and its wealth. The line of the Great Wall, though no longer the boundary of China Proper, the provinces of Chili and Shanshi extending far beyond it, presents, on the whole, an adaptable military frontier. Buttressed at either extremity by mountains, its centre protected by the sandy wastes that descend to the Yellow River, all the routes through it from the north converge at a limited number of natural passages which can be readily fortified. No other approaches are practicable for any large bodies of troops owing to the lack of roads and supplies. Its vulnerable points are at its eastern end, where the railway is exposed to attack from the sea, to the north of Kalgan, where the Chinese colonists have settled and cultivated a broad strip of country, and in the west of Kansuh, where the disaffected Muhammadans are frequently in revolt. There is also a lack of good lateral communications immediately within the Wall, though their construction need not entail any great expense. The base would be the Wei Valley and the plain of Northern Honan, connected with it and each other by rail, while its eastern flank could be protected by the sea. Generally speaking, it is the best line available, and in any case the most northerly in the defence of which a Naval Power could materially assist or participate. There is, however, further south another frontier which so nearly coincides with the limits of the British “ sphere of influence ” that its description may be of interest. Roughly it is the course of the Yellow River from the western borders of Shantung to Tungkuan, and thence the chain of the Tsingling Mountains to the confines of Tibet. The Yang-tsze Kiang runs parallel to it, at an average distance of 250 miles throughout its entire length, and would afford an admirable base, while its flanks are secured to the east by the Kiangsu marshes and the sea, and to the west by the tremendous range of the Kuen Lun. Premising the neutrality of the Power in occupation of Shantung, it would only be necessary to hold the positions of Weihui, Tzechau on the left, and Kaifong-Cheng-Honan-fu on the right bank of the Yellow River to close all the roads from the north that are east of Tungkuan. Beyond that fortress the strong passes of Lantien, Tiencha, Tsinchow, and Serku command the north-western approaches. Should there be a possibility of attack from Shan tung, the line could be completed by the erection of one or two entrenched camps on the Kaifong-Nanking road, though the lake country itself is an almost insuperable barrier to any advance on a large scale. All the forward and13 lateral communications that would be needed follow actual trade routes if not probable railways, and the total length of the entire frontier, from the sea to Tibet, is barely i,000 miles. The second question to be considered is the formation of an effective native army, for the existing institution is worse than useless. At first sight, the prospects do not appear very encouraging, for the Chinese are absolutely deficient in those religious or altruistic sentiments, which such oreat thinkers as Prince von Bismarck and Mr. Kidd tell us are essential to success in war or trade. Possibly such conditions do not apply to the Yellow races, for the Japanese, who are a singularly sceptical people, certainly make material progress. But the Chinaman lacks in addition that confidence in himself which makes so strongly for valour whether on the battlefield or the Stock Exchange, and indeed seems to be the most cowardly of all the Asiatic peoples, the Persians not excepted. Nevertheless, under European discipline, and with that good food, good pay, and good leading on which the physical bravery of uneducated masses so greatly depend, much may be done, and the best material for recruits will probably be found in Hunan, Shantung, and among the tribesmen. The question of officers is a much harder one. As there is no aristocracy of birth in China, and consequently no caste to draw on open competition, preceded by early military training, would appear to be the best solution; though it will be long before any standard of education or any rate of emolu ment 5 can exalt the military career from the disrepute into which it has fallen. But foreign officers will in any case be essential for a Chinese army, no less than foreign control of its organisation and concurrently of the hypothecated funds; without this nothing can be done. Similar considerations apply in the main to the reform of the civil adminis tration, for the literary and bureaucratic classes, enervated and peculating, are equally weak in moral and physical stamina, and though they may learn to obey, appear as yet incapable of command. But the body of the people does not share all these defects. The Chinese, in the words of Dr. Johnson, are a “ distinct and very singular race of men ”, but they have many excellent qualities. They are laborious, honest, and lawabiding, and latterly they have been by no means blind to the evils of the present regime. They are, I believe, eminently capable of advance ment, and the only real obstacles are the vested interests and reactionary influence of the Mandarins. These, however, could be dealt with arbitrarily. Einally, whatever political destinies are reserved for China, two conditions are necessary for her reform. They are, firstly, the development of the resources of the country; and, secondly, the consequent spread of knowledge among the people. The nation that accomplishes this work will keep open to trade the greatest potential market of the world and will incidentally confer on a quarter of its inhabitants the inestimable benefits of Western civilisation.
