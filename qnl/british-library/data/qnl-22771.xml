The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Surgeon General With the Government of Bombay, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour td&gt; invite a reference to your circular memorandum No.s/ 219 , dated the 12th February 1925, to the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, in v/hich the date for the submission of annual indents for drugs, etc., by the dispensaries in the Persian Gulf is fixed as the 1s t Janu ary. 2. It has already been found that, as the supply indented for in January is for use during the financial year beginning with the month of April following, the date fixed for the submission of the indents is extremely inconvenient for accounts purposes for the following reasons:- fa) That the cost of the supply if adjusted before the end of March is debited to the grant of one year while the supnly relates to the subsequent ^ear*. (b) That the date fixed being in the last quarter of the financial year and means of aeaemedatieR communication between the various Gulf ports and India being none too speedy, there is not a sufficient margin of time to ensure that the cost of the supply will always be adjusted in the financial year in which the supply is made. (c) That as a result of the second reason it is very often libely that the cost of two indents may be debited to one year’s grant and thus ceeate a difficult situation in regard to the control of expenditure against budget grants. 3. I shallI shall he vary grateful if, in oonsicleration of the above you can see your way to changing the date for the cutnission of indents by the dispensaries in the Persian Gulf from the 1st January to the 1st April. The latter elate would ensure the cost of the supply being adjusted against the grant of the year to which the supply relates and in which the supply is made, 4. In the neantlrh© I an instructing the Residency Surgeon and the hedical Officers in charge of dispensaries in the Gulf to withhold the submission of their indents due on the 1st January 1G27, till a decision has been arrived at on the present reference.
