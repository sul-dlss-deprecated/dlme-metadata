                           Hamburger Fremdenblatt, 3 December 1915.The report discusses Rohrbach's opinions on the current situation in Europe and how Germany now had an advantage following the opening up of routes to the Middle East and the Suez Canal through the provision of railways and money to Turkey. The lecture also focused on Germany's need for raw materials, how access to the Middle East can provide them with oil, minerals, cotton and wheat, and the potential future economic benefits posed by the war-time alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey. The lecture concludes with the suggestion that as Germany cannot compete with Britain in its Naval strength it could use the Suez Canal as a point of pressure to try to secure access to the sea and its own position in the heart of Europe.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Hamburger Fremdenblatt, Newspaper</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Paul Rohrbach</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Germany</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Suez Canal</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Turkey</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Middle East</geographic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00024e#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00024e#share">Unknown</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
