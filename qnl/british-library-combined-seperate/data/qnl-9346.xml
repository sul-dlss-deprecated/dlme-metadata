The issue arose in response to a request from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited to the Foreign Office in 1938 concerning the extent of Iranian (generally referred to as Persian) territory, in order that the company could choose the precise location of the 100,000 square mile oil concession granted to them by the Iranian Government.The islands principally concerned are Tamb (also referred to as Tumb and Tunb), Little Tamb (also referred to as Nabiya Tunb), Abu Musa, Farur, Little Farur (also referred to as Nabiya Farur), Sirri, Arabi, and Farsi.The papers include correspondence from the Foreign Office describing the position of the British Government with regard to the status of each island; the question of whether to offer an ex gratia payment to the Shaikh of Sharjah in respect of any oil found at Sirri, September-October 1938; papers concerning the extent of Iranian territorial waters and the issue of offshore oil fields, including comments by the Petroleum Department, 1938; and the flying of the flag of the Shaikh of Ras al Khaima over Tamb Island, 1942.The file also includes India Office confidential prints dated 1928 relating to the status of some of the islands concerned.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Little Farur</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Little Tamb</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Farsi Island</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sirri</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Farur</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Musa Island</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Tamb Island</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Iran</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001d6#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001d6#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001d6#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
