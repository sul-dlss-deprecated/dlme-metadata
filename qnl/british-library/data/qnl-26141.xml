No. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir PROOF. to Sir COSMO PARKINSON. (Received 19th May, 1936.) My dear Parkinson, The Residency, Aden, 5th May, 1936. As it has been proposed that I should go to England this summer to discuss with the India Office and the Colonial Office details connected with the transfer of Aden, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were discussed at a meeting at the Foreign Office in 1933, and adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. I also enclose a copy of a Draft Estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending copies of my note and of the draft estimate to the India Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours, &amp;c., B. R. REILLY.

Income Tax. —I consider that the present income tax rates should be continued, as proposed, under an Aden Ordinance to be made by the new Aden Crown Colony Government. A point for consideration is the levy of the present surcharge on income tax and super tax which was introduced by the Government of India as an emergency measure in 1931, and which has subsequently been reduced from 25 to 8^ per cent. If this surcharge is to be continued by the Government of India next year, I consider that it should be continued in Aden also, but that its abolition in Aden should be considered when it is abolished in India. The question of the collection of income tax from firms, companies, and individuals doing business in Aden who have their headquarters or principal branches in India, and who therefore at present pay the income tax arising from the profits of their Aden business in India instead of in Aden, is of great importance, as the question of balancing the future Aden budget will depend to a great extent on the amount of income tax that can be derived from this source. In September, 1933, a statement was sent to the Acting Chief Commissioner at Aden by the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India showing the approximate amount of income tax and super tax paid on their Aden business by certain firms having their headquarters at Bombay, Surat and Calcutta, with branches in Aden. The statement was as follows: — Bombay. Bengal. T otal. Net income tax and super tax. Net income tax and super tax. Rs. Rs. Rs. 1930-31 31,640 2,49,211 2,80,851 1931-32 8,276 2,00,171 2,08,447 1932-33 1,52,294 ' 99,307 2,51,601 It will be useful if this statement can now be brought up to date. Meanwhile the Income Tax Officer at Aden is requesting the local managers of the Aden branches of firms whose headquarters are in India to be prepared to submit to him separate returns on account of their Aden business before the 1st of April, 1937, for the purpose of income tax assessment. Point 2. Post Office and Telephones. —In November, 1933, the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India sent me the following information on this subject: — “ The total receipts and expenditure of Aden head post office and the five post offices under it for the past three years are : — Receipts. Rs. Expenditure. Rs. 1930-31 1,73,645 1,83,728 1931-32 1,66,546 1,76,921 1932-33 1,61,071 1,79,449 As regards telephones, as the Aden telephone system was taken over by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department only from the 1st of July, 1932, when the whole system was reconstructed, it is not possible to give any reliable estimate of profit and loss. From the various estimates which have, however, been prepared from time to time, it is computed that approximately a sum of Rs. 1,63,200 has been spent by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department on the work of remodelling the system, including capital expenditure on buildings, and on this basis, the annual expenditure on interest, depreciation, maintenance, establishment and overheads, etc., is computed at Rs.42,700, approximately, exclusive of (1) battery charges, (2) hot and cold weather charges, (3) lighting, (4) stationery and printing, and (5) other contingent charges. “ The receipts for the first year are reported to be Rs.58,710, but as already remarked this is based on pure estimates and is susceptible of modification. ^ It is desirable to bring this information up to date, and to obtain detailed statements of revenue and expenditure for several years. I suggest that this be done through the India Office. With regard to the Post Office figures, I assume that the receipts include the proceeds of the sale of stamps, but I do not know whether the expenditure figures(C21513) B* 3 include the cost of printing them. The printing of stamps for Aden will in future presumably be arranged by the Colonial Office, and the cost debited to Aden, and it will be of interest to know what the annual expenditure on this account is likely to be. With regard to telephones, it will be seen from the Government of India letter that I have quoted that approximately a sum of Rs. 1,63,200 was spent in 1932-33 by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department on the work of remodelling the system, including the capital expenditure on buildings. It must be decided whether this sum is to be paid to the Government of India by His Majesty's Government or by the new Aden Administration. It appears to me undesirable that the new Colony should commence its existence burdened by a debt of this nature, and I hope therefore that the payment can be made by His Majesty's Government. In this connexion I wish to refer to Point 14 in the minutes of the meeting held at the Foreign Office in 1933, which recorded my suggestion that all Government buildings at Aden should be transferred free of cost by the Government of India to His Majesty's Government (and by the latter to the new Aden Government). If this principle is accepted, the Government of India's expenditure on telephone buildings should be excluded from the sum to be paid to them for the telephone system. A reduction should also be made on account of depreciation of the system during the years since it was installed. At present, both the Aden Rost Office and the Aden Telephones are directly but separately under the control of the Postmaster-General, Bombay, who sends to Aden a Postmaster and an Officer in Charge of Telephones. Neither of these officials is in any way subordinate to the other; their work is conducted independently of each other in Aden, although they are both under the same control in India. After the transfer, it would probably be necessary that both Posts and Telephones should be placed under the combined control of an officer responsible to the new Government, and that there should therefore be an Officer in Charge of Aden Posts and Telephones. I suggest that this officer be obtained on deputation from the Government of India, unless the Colonial Office can supply him. A tentative provision for the cost of his appointment has been made in the Draft Estimates. An alternative that has been suggested to me is that the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department should continue to work the Aden Post Offices and Telephones for a few years after the transfer, as I understand was done in the case of the Traq Post Offices. If the administration of the Postal and Telephone Departments is taken over by the new Aden Government, it is probable that additional staff will be necessary in the Post Office for maintaining Exchange accounts, and in the Telephone Department for billing and accounting, work which at present is done in Bombay; and with the appointment of a Director of Posts and Telephones it will still be necessary to have two subordinate officers in separate charge of each of the Departments under the Director. The retention of control by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department would obviate the necessity for additional expenditure of this nature. I do not, however, know whether the Indian Department would be prepared to manage the Aden Post Offices and Telephones on behalf of the Aden Government, or, if so, on what terms they would be willing to do so. I suggest, however, that this possibility be examined by the Colonial Office, and that, if there is no objection to it in principle, it should be discussed with the Government of India. Point 3. Printing and Sale of Stamps. —I have referred to this question under Point 2. Indian postage rates are at present in force in Aden; that is to say, the minimum charge for ordinary letters is (1) One anna to any place in India, (2) 2|- annas * to the United Kingdom and all the British possessions participating in the British Imperial postage scheme and (3) 3^ annas to any other part of the world served by foreign post except Ceylon and Portuguese India. I consider that these Indian rates should be continued, at any rate for a time, if this is possible under Colonial administra tion. An exception may be the rate to India. If the Government of India decide to raise the postage from India to Aden from the first to the second category, it may be necessary for the Aden Government similarly to raise the rate from Aden to India. This change would be unpopular in Aden, especially with the Indian community, many of whom have a large business correspondence with India. It will be more satisfactory if the present postal rates between India and Aden could be preserved by special agreement, and I recommend that the possibility of making an arrangement to this effect be examined. Point 4. Mail Contract .—It was agreed at the meeting held in 1933 that the India Office should ascertain whether mail steamers must call at Aden under the terms of their contract with the Government of India, and it was proposed that the existing arrange ment should, if the Government of India agree, remain unchanged, at any rate for the4 balance of the period of the Government of India s present mail contiact. I do not know what has been done with regard to this matter since the 1933 meeting, but I hope that an arrangement can be made as proposed. Details should also be obtained regard ing other payments that have to be made for the conveyance of mails to other destinations than those served by the mail contract and for the on-carriage of mails dropped at Aden for transhipment. Point 5. Currency. —It was agreed at the 1933 meeting that Aden should continue to use Indian currency, and that, subject to the agreement of the Government of India, arrangements should be made for the supply of necessary currency from India. I do not know whether any further action has been taken on this subject, but I recommend that the Government of India’s consent be obtained to the arrangement proposed. Point 6. Treasury and Finance. —I understand that it is the practice in most Colonies for the budget to be brought forward annually by a Chief, or Colonial, Secretary. This appointment does not exist in Aden at present, and will not exist unless the Administration is reorganized on a Colonial model. I have therefore proposed the appointment of a Treasurer, and I understand that this suggestion was accepted at the 1933 meeting. At that meeting, Mr. Cowell said that he would enquire of the Personnel Division of the Colonial Office as to the probable rate of pay it would be necessary to offer. If the transfer of Aden is to take place in the early part of next year, I consider that the selection of a Treasurer should be made as soon as possible, to enable him to take up his duties immediately on Aden becoming a Colony. I further suggest that the officer selected be sent to Aden on special duty some months prior to the transfer, to study the financial position of the new Colony and to assist in the preparation of its first budget. With regard to the latter, I shall make some further remarks later in this note. I have suggested that the Treasurer should be in charge of the Income Tax and Salt and Excise Departments as well as of the Treasury. This would place him in control of all the Government Revenue and Expenditure Departments of the Colony and might involve some rearrangement in the existing superior posts of these Departments. The duties of Treasury Officer and of Collector of Salt and Excise are at present performed by the Extra Assistant Commissioner, an officer on Rs. 500-50-750 a month, who also performs magisterial and administrative duties. Both he and the Income Tax Officer are now nearing their time of retirement. I suggest that the Extra Assistant Com missioner’s appointment be revised and re-named, and that it be filled by a junior Colonial Office official, whose duties will be mainly magisterial and who would, as far as possible, be relieved of some of the other work now performed by the Extra Assistant Commissioner. A whole-time Income Tax Officer, however, will still be necessary though he would work under the control of the Treasurer. These are points on which I shall be glad to have the advice of the new Treasurer, which is an additional reason for my request that he should be sent to Aden in advance of the transfer to look into the present system of working these Departments and to advise on any changes that might suitably be made in them. Point 7. Audit. —It has been proposed to place the Aden accounts under the Director of Colonial Audit, who would send an auditor once or twice a year, a contribu- ' tion to his salary being made from Aden. It has been assumed that it will be unnecessary to appoint a special local auditor but that a local audit clerk would probably be necessary. The Examiner of Outside Audit of the Bombay Presidency, who paid a recent visit to Aden, advised that a local audit staff of one superintendent and two clerks should be maintained for internal audit. This would be an additional expense, but contributions to the cost could be expected from the Port Trust and Aden Settlement Fund. I suggest that the strength of the local subordinate audit establishment be decided after consultation with the new Treasurer. Point 8. New Laws and Enactments .—It has been agreed that all existing Indian Laws and Enactments, including the Indian Civil and Criminal Procedure, Codes, and procedure should remain in force. This will presumably be effected by means of an Order in Council as in the case of British Somaliland when it was separated from Indian control. With regard to new Laws, it has been proposed that the Governor should be given power, with the consent of the Crown, to enact them, the concurrent power of the Crown to legislate by Order in Council being retained.5 There will be an Executive Council, of which I suggest that the following should be ex officio members: — The Governor. The Air Officer Commanding. The Political Secretary. The Civil Secretary. The Chairman of the Aden Port Trust and Settlement. The Treasurer. If non-official members are appointed they should be representative of the different communities in Aden, and they would therefore probably have to be not less than five in number, which would allow for one European, one Indian, two Arabs (as representing the largest community) and one Jew. I do not suggest that this racial allocation should be laid down by regulation, but it would probably be followed in practice by the Governor in making his recommendations. If it is not considered advisable to add these non-official members to the Executive Council at present, they might be made members of an Advisory Council, which would also include the members of the Executive Council, and would be summoned at the Governor's discretion only to discuss matters on which he wished to obtain direct contact with local public opinion. With regard to the drafting of new Laws or Enactments, it has been proposed that the Governor should ask for the advice of the Colonial Office on drafts prepared with the assistance of the Judicial Assistant at Aden, and that in cases of real urgency or emergency he would have to do the best he could, leaving any errors to be remedied later. In this connexion, I may mention that the designation of Judicial Assistant has been changed in 1933 to District and Sessions Judge, but he still acts in an advisory capacity in legal matters to the Resident and Chief Commissioner, and it should be made clear in the terms of future appointments that he is to continue to exercise this function for the Governor in addition to his judicial duties. I suggest that “ Legal Adviser ' be added to the present official designation of this officer. Point 9. Local Bodies .—It has been agreed that the Aden Port Trust and the Aden Settlement should continue their separate existence and should not be merged in the new local Administration, and I consider that this is the best course. Point 10. Lighthouses .—At the meeting in London in 1933, the Colonial Office undertook to take up the question of future arrangements in connexion with lighthouses with the Board of Trade. I do not know the result of this consultation, but I adhere to the view that the two lighthouses on Perim Island should be taken over and maintained by the Board of Trade, possibly with a contribution from the Government of India, light dues from ships on their account being collected not at Perim or Aden, but at Suez, as I understand is already done for the upkeep of other lights maintained by the Board of Trade in the Red Sea. The two lighthouses at Aden are at present managed by the Aden Port Trust, the Government of India paying for half the up-keep of one of them. It is possible that the Port Trust would be willing to forgo this contribution from Government, and would undertake the entire upkeep of these two lights_ from its own funds. In that case no light dues of any kind would be collected from shipping at Aden or Perim, as the present collection of light dues at these places on behalf of the Government of India would presumably cease. This change would be welcome here, as being calculated to enhance the popularity of the Port. Point 11. Ecclesiastical.—There has been a considerable amount of correspondence on this subject, and I have recently advocated the appointment of Royal Air Force chaplains at Aden and its separation from the Diocese of Bombay. My reason for departing from the recommendation made in my letter of the 10th of August, 1933, that Aden should remain in the Diocese of Bombay, and continue to be served by chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Establishment, was that I was given to understand that it would be impossible to send these Indian Service chaplains to Aden after the transfer except on a voluntary basis, which, in my opinion, would be unworkable. I have, however, now heard from the Bishop of Bombay that he hopes to find a means of overcoming this difficulty. If so, I would gladly revert to my original view that the present ecclesiastical arrangements should continue. This opinion is, however, subject to one reservation. At present the normal establishment here is two chaplains, of whom one is paid wholly by the Government of India and the other is paid in the proportion of one-quarter by the Government of India and three-quarters by the Air Ministry. As at least three-quarters of the members of the Church of England in Aden belong to the Army and Royal Air Force, I consider that the Air Ministry ought to pay three- quarters of the total cost of the Ecclesiastical Establishment. I understand that they B*2 (C21513)6 are willing to do so for one chaplain but are not prepared to pay any part of the cost of a second chaplain. I do not consider that Aden revenues can justifiably be debited with one and one-quarter of the cost of the chaplains who are here mainly for the benefit of His Majesty’s Services, and, if the Air Ministry are not prepared to modify their view, the establishment will have to be reduced from two chaplains to one. In my opinion this would be an undesirable result, as I do not think that one chaplain is sufficient, and the absence of a second chaplain leaves no provision for sickness or short leaves of absence. If it is eventually decided to increase the permanent garrison of Aden, I hope that the Air Ministry will modify their view and will agree to bear a proportionate share of the cost of two chaplains. At present thd Air Ministry pay an annual contribution of Rs.45© in respect of the maintenance of Churches and Rs.450 for the maintenance of cemeteries. I recommend that these contributions should continue to be made. Point 12. Lunatic Asylum. —It was agreed at the 1933 meeting that the best course would be, if the Government of India saw no objection, to permit the existing practice of sending lunatics from Aden to India to continue, possibly for a small agreed payment per head by the new Aden Administration. I do not know whether this matter has been taken up with the Government of India : if not, I suggest that this be done now. Point 13. Rate of Income Tax. —This has been dealt with under Point 1. The question whether officers serving under the Civil and Political Administration should pay British income tax depends on the decision with regard to the framing of the budget. If all officers are paid from the Aden budget, and a grant-in-aid received from His Majesty’s Government, the officers would be liable to Aden income tax and not to British income tax. At present the Government of India receive an agreed sum of £500 from His Majesty’s Government towards income tax on the salaries of Military and Air Force personnel and Political Officers, who are exempted from Indian income tax. A similar amount may be expected from His Majesty’s Government after the separation. Point 11. Transfer of Government Buildings. —At the 1933 meeting I suggested that the most satisfactory course would be that all Government buildings should be transferred free by the Government of India to His Majesty’s Government who would, in their turn, transfer them to the new Aden Administration. This procedure would be in accordance with the course adopted with regard to military buildings at Aden owned by the Government of India when the military control of Aden was transferred to the Air Ministry. Similarly, when the Air Ministry found that some of these buildings were surplus to their requirements, they were returned free of cost to the Government of India, who, in their turn, transferred them free of cost to the Government of Bombay, who handed them over, also free of cost, to thei Aden Settlement. The above remarks refer to the fourteen points that were discussed at the meeting held in London in 1933. I propose now to comment on certain other points which, in my opinion, also require consideration. Point 15. Budget. —At present the finances of Aden and of the Aden Protectorate are entirely separate, the former being controlled by the Government of India and the latter by the Colonial Office. A budget for Aden is submitted annually to the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India, and all receipts and expenditure are credited and debited to the Government of India. Aden has no separate financial existence. Income tax due from several firms doing business in Aden is collected from their head offices in India and not from their branches in Aden. The accounts of the Post Office and Telephones and of the Mercantile Marine Department (including Lighthouses), which are directly administered by the Government of India and not through the Chief Commissioner, are dealt with in India and not in Aden, and do not appear in the Aden budget. The latter therefore in its present form is not an accurate presentation of Aden’s financial position as a whole. After the transfer there will have to be a comprehensive budget showing all Aden Government revenue and expenditure, and, as both Aden and the Aden Protectorate will then be under the control of the Colonial Office, the question arises whether the Aden and the Aden Protectorate budgets should be combined. This is a point on which I desire instructions. I suggest that there7 might be one budget divided into two parts—Civil (for Aden) and Political (for the Protectorate). The finances of Aden and of the Aden Protectorate could thus be kept distinct for local purposes, but would be combined in the budget submitted for approval annually to the Colonial Office. A grant-in-aid from His Majesty's Government will be necessary and it should include, in addition to actual expenditure on the Protectorate, all contributions at present made by His Majesty's Government towards civil services, for example, Police, Civil Hospital, Residency and Treasury Establishments. It is hoped that the remaining expenditure on Aden can be met from local revenue, but this will depend largely on : — {a) the amount of income tax that will be realized from firms doing business in Aden which at present do not pay income tax here, (6) the future of the Aden salt industry, and (c) the future position of Aden with regard to trade with Abyssinia which may possibly be diverted from Aden as a result of future developments in that country. I am submitting, as an accompaniment to this note, a Draft Estimate for an Aden budget (as distinct from the Protectorate) based on the actuals of the last three years and on the assumption that existing expenditure on personnel and service will be maintained, but with the addition of the increased revenue that it is hoped to receive and of increased expenditure that appears to be unavoidable. These increases are calculated on estimates that can at present be only tentative. They will need further examination in the light of fuller information regarding future income tax receipts and the prospects of the salt industry and of the Abyssinian trade, and in relation to whatever decisions are made by His Majesty's Government regarding future administrative personnel and other details of administrative expenditure, such as Ecclesiastical Establishment and lighthouses. Point 16. Personnel .—In Mr. Cowell's letter to the India Office dated 24th October, 1933*, an assurance was given on behalf of the Colonial Office that all Indian administra tive personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent, and that it was intended that when vacancies occurred, though there would be a gradual substitution of officers of the Colonial Service in the Aden Service, Indians and officers of the Indian Political Department would remain eligible for appointment to such posts. In a telegram from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, No. 798, dated 25th March, 1933f, it was stated that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to retain a proportion of Indian Service administrative personnel in Aden Service for some years after the transfer takes place, and it was suggested that posts at present staffed from India might continue so to be filled for about five years from the date of separation in the first instance. If so, not only would officers who are serving in Aden at the time of the transfer be retained, but they would in the ordinary course be relieved by other Indian Service Officers for about five years. It is understood that they would be retained at Aden on Indian rates of pay and on Indian terms of service. Their leave rules would therefore differ from those of officers in Colonial Service. The latter will probably be given leave after 18 months of duty, but Indian Service officers usually do longer spells of continuous duty and then obtain longer periods of leave than is customary in Colonial Service. The question arises as to how leave vacancies, in the case of these officers will be filled. In the case of Colonial Service officers now serving at Aden, there is an adequate reserve to enable leave to be taken without the necessity of obtaining other officers for replacement. This is not so in the case of Indian Service officers now in Aden. When one of them goes on leave it will therefore be necessary for the Government of India to replace him by another officer, either temporarily for the period of his leave or substantively. This may have already been arranged between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, but if not, I suggest that a clear understanding should now be reached on this point. Indian Service officers may remain at Aden either {a) on deputation, or {b) by retiring from Indian Service and transferring to Colonial Service. With regard to {a), the conditions under which officers may serve on deputation are laid down in Part VII, Chapter XII read with Appendix 11 of the Government of India Fundamental Rules. Deputation must be on a voluntary basis and officers are entitled to a deputation allowance not exceeding 25 per cent. The Aden Administration would also have to pay contributions to the Government of India towards leave, passages and pensions of these officers. This must be taken into consideration in calculating the cost to the new Administration of retaining Indian Service officers at Aden. f Enclosure in No. 17960/33 [No. 22] : not printed. * No. 35 in Middle East No. 50. (C21513) B*38 v With regard to (6), I do not think that officers belonging to Indian cadres are likely to elect for transfer to Colonial Service. I have, however, been informed privately that Mr. J. T. Lawrence, M.A., Indian Civil Service (retired on premature pension), who was Judicial Assistant at Aden from 1927 to 1931, would be willing to return to Aden after its transfer as District and Sessions Judge on any reasonable rate of pay offered to him by the Colonial Office, provided that he will be permitted to continue to draw his ^ Indian pension. The services of an officer such as Mr. Lawrence, who is familiar with ™ Indian law and procedure, who has experience of Aden, and who is still young enough to work energetically in a hot climate, would be very valuable, and they could be obtained comparatively cheaply if his Colonial Service pay were additional to his pension. I hope that this method of recruiting officers for Aden, who are suitable in age and other respects, may be approved by both His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. I may mention incidentally that this principle has been adopted in the case of the present Civil Administrator, Kamaran, who is a retrenched Indian Army Officer drawing his Indian Army pension in addition to a salary in Kamaran. I attach statements (A and B) showing the present superior and subordinate staffs in the existing Government administrative departments in Aden. In addition to these there are the officers and subordinate staffs of the Aden Port Trust and Aden Settlement, which I assume will remain unchanged. At present the administrative machinery for Aden is entirely distinct from that of the Protectorate, the only connecting link between the two being the Resident and Chief Commissioner. When both Aden and the Pro tectorate are under the same control by the Colonial Office, it may eventually be decided to modify this dual system by appointing a Chief Secretary and an Assistant Secretary and possibly some junior Political Officers whose work, like that of the Governor, will be concerned with both Aden and the Protectorate, or who will be interchangeable between these two branches of the Aden Government. If so, I suggest that this change should be brought about gradually, and that there should be no immediate alteration in the existing system. At present the Resident and Chief Commissioner has on his immediate staff a Political Secretary responsible to him for Protectorate affairs and a Civil Secretary who deals, under the Chief Commissioner’s direction, with Aden affairs. There is no official corresponding to a Chief Secretary, but the Political Secretary is senior to the Civil Secretary, and it is established that he acts for the Resident and Chief Commissioner when the latter is absent. This arrangement is open to the objection that the Political Secretary who has at times to act as the head of the dual administration, is familiar with only one side of it. It has, however, the merit of enabling the Political and Civil Secretaries to devote their whole time and attention to their respective spheres, which differ very greatly from each other owing to the strong contrast between conditions in Aden and conditions in the Protectorate. Aden is a small and progressive urban area which includes an important fortress and naval and air force bases, an active commercial community of a variety of races, and a busy fuelling and trading port, and is directly administered under the laws and customs of British India. On the other hand, the Protectorate is not under any form of direct British administration: its more advanced parts are governed by Chiefs under the Moslem Sheria Law, and its backward districts are merely tribal areas, many of which are in a semi-anarchic condition. The officers who deal with Aden and those who deal with the Protectorate have very divergent problems and there is a good deal to be said for letting them specialize in their own particular duties. After the transfer, officers belonging to the Government of India Services who remain in Aden will be on deputation, unless they transfer to Colonial Service, and it will not be possible to retain them here without their own consent and without that of their departmental superiors in India. I have consulted the principal officers now in Aden with regard to their wishes in the event of the transfer taking place early next year, and remarks on this subject are included in the attached statement A. I assume that the assurances given by the Colonial Office with regard to terms of service applies also to the Subordinate Services, and that their services under the Govern ment of India will count towards their pension. I should like to be in a position to give an immediate assurance to them to this effect. If this is done I am confident that the majority of the members of the present Subordinate Services in Aden will wish to continue to s6rve after the transfer. When the members of these Subordinate Services or others who transfer to the new Administration, retire, their pensions would be payable by the Government of India and the Aden Administration in proportion to their services under the respective Governments. Those who do not wish to remain and who belong to Services in India will presumably be absorbed into India. Those who have been recruited specially for Aden will wish to know what will happen to them if they are not willing to serve under the Colonial Office, that is to say, whether they will be re-employed in India or be given pensions or proportionate pensions. These are points for the decision of the Government of India.9 (C21513) B*4 Point 17. The Governors Powers—The financial and administrative powers of the Chief Commissioner are now defined by the Government of India, and there are special provisions dealing with his powers in relation to the Aden Port Trust, which is a statutory body constituted under the Aden Port Trust Act of 1888 (Bombay Act No. V of 1888). The general financial and administrative powers of the future Governor will doubtless be defined by His Majesty's Government, and, in doing so, it should be decided to what extent he will exercise powers now reserved to the Government of India in respect of the Aden Port Trust and in respect of certain Acts and Regulations regarding which the powers of the Chief Commissioner are now limited. I attach a copy of the Government of India Notifications, Nos. 171-N dated 1st April, 1932, and 199-N dated 15th May, 1934, under which the powers of the Chief Commissioner in respect of laws and enactments are at present regulated. The Chief Commissioner’s financial powers are defined in Chapter V of Part II of the Government of India Book of Financial Powers. Point 18. Table of Precedence.—At present the precedence of senior officers serving in Aden is regulated by the Indian Warrant of Precedence. When Aden is separated from India their appointments will disappear in this Warrant, and their precedence must then be regulated by the Colonial Office Administration. Aden being a Naval, Military and Air Force centre, it is necessary to decide relative seniority of civil officials with Naval, Military and Air Force officers. At present the Political Secretary ranks below a Lieutenant-Colonel, the Civil Secretary and District Magistrate ranks with a Major, and the Chairman of the Aden Port Trust ranks between the two. In my opinion, the grading of all these three officers ought to be raised. The Political Secretary should rank with Lieutenant-Colonels, and the Chairman of the Aden Port Trust and Settlement (who holds a most responsible position) might well do the same. The Civil Secretary might also be put on the same grade as the Political Secretary. The District and Sessions Judge at present ranks above Lieutenant-Colonels, and I think that this should remain unchanged. I recommend that his designation under Colonial Administration be Chief Justice and Legal Adviser or Judge and Legal Adviser I recommend that the opportunity of a change in the Warrant of Precedence be taken to make the alterations that I have suggested. The Civil Administrative Medical Officer, the Port Officer, and the Commandant of Police at present rank in accordance with their seniority in their own Services, all three at present being graded with Lieutenant-Colonels. As long as these posts are filled by officers of the Indian Services this practice might continue; but in view of possible changes in future I suggest that the appointments of Civil Administrative Medical Officer and Port Officer be classed with Lieutenant-Colonels and that of the Commandant of Police between Lieutenant-Colonels and Majors. The officer in charge of the Aden Administration is now the Resident, Chief Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief, being Resident in respect of the Protectorate and Chief Commissioner in respect of Aden. I understand that it is the intention of His Majesty's Government that he will in future be termed Governor and Commander- in-Chief, this designation being in respect of both Aden and the Protectorate. At present he ranks 13 in the Indian Warrant of Precedence and is entitled to a salute of 13 guns. After the transfer his appointment will disappear from the Indian Warrant and I presume that his salute will be increased to 17 guns in accordance with paragraph 52 of the King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions. Visits of British and Foreign warships are frequent at Aden and calls between the Resident and Commander-in-Chief and Naval Officers are regulated by paragraph 99 of the King’s Regulations and Admiralty Instructions. The practice in this respect will be altered if the Resident is given the status of the Governor. The Air Officer Commanding at Aden now ranks at 33 in the Indian Warrant: in future he will presumably rank in Aden immediately after the Governor. It will be necessary to give the Treasurer a position in the new Warrant and this will depend on the’relative seniority that he should hold in respect of other civil officials and of Naval, Military and Air Force officers in Aden, and on the position that he will hold as a member of the Executive Council. At present the two Political Officers, the Frontier Officer, the Education Officer, the Civil Surgeon, the Assistant Commandant of Police and the Extra Assistant Com missioner have no positions in the Warrant, and it is for consideration whether any or all of these officers ought to be graded. Point 19. Perim and Kamaran. —Perim is British Indian territory and adminis tratively part of Aden, and it will therefore be included in the transfer. Kamaran is not British or British Indian territory but it is administered by a Civil Administrator controlled by the Government of India through the Chief Commissioner at Aden, and its staff is largely drawn from India. The question of its future control11 (C21513) B*** Fund standing to the credit of Government servants in Aden, who are transferred (not lent on deputation) to the new Aden Administration should be handed over from the Indian Fund to a new General Provident Fund to be maintained on the same lines by the Aden Administration, to which Aden Government servants would continue to be able to contribute. This would mainly affect the Subordinate Services. Point 23. Savings Bank. —At present the Government of India have a Savings Bank administered by the Postal Department. This Savings Bank is a great help to middle class people, including subordinate Government servants, who deposit their small savings there. As there are no other banking facilities for small depositors in Aden it is desirable that this Bank should be continued under the new Administration. The Somaliland Government, it is believed, maintain a similar Bank. Point 24. Cash Certificates. —At present the Government of India issue Cash Certificates, which are in the form of a loan, cashable in five years. As this system is closely connected with the borrowing policy of the Government of India, such a system for a small Colony would not be practicable. I suggest, however, that it be arranged with the Government of India that facilities be given to existing holders of these certificates to cash them in Aden on maturity. Point 25. Postal Insurance. —At present the Government of India have a Life Insurance Fund administered through the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department for the benefit of all Government servants. It would not be possible for the new Govern ment to institute a similar Fund. It is, however, desirable that an arrangement be made for receiving premia from present policy holders at the Aden Treasury for remittance to the Government of India. Point 26. Judicial and Revenue Stamps. —Indian Court Fee, Notarial and Revenue stamps are at present used in Aden. Presumably new stamps will be printed for Aden, and existing stocks will be returned to India when the new ones will be printed. Point 27. New Flag. —At present the “ Viceroy's Union ' is flown by the Chief Commissioner. The use of this Flag will be discontinued after the transfer, and a new flag should be authorized. B. R.

The Civil Surgeon is ex officio in charge of the Department and receives .a charge allowance of Rs.100/- per mensem. A sum of Rs. 1,000/- has been provided as supervision charges payable to the Bombay Government. This item will probably be eliminated on transfer. (8) Police. A contribution of £8,000/- received from His Majesty’s Government on account of Armed Police has been entered on the Revenue side. (9) Ecclesiastical Department. Proposals are under consideration. At present the Air Ministry pay fths of the pay of one Chaplain, and a contribution of Rs.450/- for Maintenance of Churches, and Rs.450/- for Maintenance of Cemeteries. This amount has been entered on the Revenue side'. (10) Education. On the Revenue side there may be a reduction of Rs.5,000/- if the present contribution from the Port Trust ) the suitability of which has been questioned by the Government of India, ceases. (11) Medical.—Civil Administrative Medical Officer. The Port Health Officer is in charge of the Department ex officio and receives no extra remuneration. (11) Medical.—European General Hospital. The Port Health Officer is also in charge of the European General Hospital. An approximate provision has been made for the Deputation allowance for S.M.S. Officers deputed from Bombay. Civil Hospital. An approximate provision has been made for the S.M.S. Officers deputed from Bombay for the Civil Hospital and other dispensaries. (17) Central Public Works (Civil Works) Department. The Port Trust carry out the work on behalf of Government who pay to them supervision charges at 24^ per cent. The Chairman, Aden Port Trust, receives an allowance of Rs.100/- per mensem from the Port Trust fund for super vising the work and accounts. The Department is budgetted under a separate head and is not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. It is included under (73) Civil Works. (17) [a) Salt. No provision has been made for pay of officers, as the Department is in charge of the Extra Assistant Commissioner. It is budgetted under a separate head III—Salt, and is not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. The revenue on account of salt will depend on the future policy of the Government of India with regard to the admission of salt from Aden into India. There.may be a considerable fall in revenue. (18) Ports and Pilotage. Is budgetted under a separate head 27—Ports and Pilotage, and not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. The Principal Officer ) Mercantile Marine Department, is an Officer of the R.I.N. who receives his grade pay as Commander (Rs. 900/-) plus a staff allowance of Rs. 620/- (free water and quarters from the Port Trust). The pay and allowances are shared in moities by the Port Trust and Government. (19) Lighthouses and Light Ships. Is budgetted for under a separate head 21 — Lighthouses and Lightships, and not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. The Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department^ is in charge of the Department. On the revenue side, the total revenue is for all light dues including India, and a proportionate share only has been taken into account in the Draft Estimate on the assumption that the Perim lights are to be maintained and supervised from Aden. I any however, recommending that they be taken over by the Board of Trade, in which case both revenue and expenditure on their account would disappear from the Aden Estimates. (20) Income Tax Department. Is budgetted for under a separate head, Demand No. 17 Income Tax, and is not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. Income tax receipts vary, and the estimate should be taken with reserve, as much depends on the prosperity of the port and trade and also on the export of salt. The largest factor in income tax receipts is Salt Industry, which pays a large sum. An addition of Rs.2,47,000 has been made on the Revenue side on account of the anticipated yield of income tax from firms doing business in Aden which now pay their income tax in India and not at Aden. This estimate is based on the average of the figures given by the Government of India in 1933 for the years 1930-31 to 1932-33. The Income Tax Officer is due to retire. Leave and pension contributions, Deputation allowance and Passage Contribution have been provisionally made—subject to new arrangements in con templation. (22) Postal Department. Recent figures for the staff and allowances have been given by the Postmaster. They do not however include supervision charges for inspection and directorate. Leave and Pension contributions and deputation allowances for Postal subordinates have been made. (23) Telephones. The figures of the Telephones are purely a guess and not an accurate estimate. (24) Indian Partnership Act. Administration of the Indian Partnership Act is a minor Department under (5) and it is budgetted for separately under Miscellaneous 69 and not included in the annual Aden Budget 85A. General Remarks. Under Expenditure, provision has been made for the cost of additions to staff that will probably be unavoidable. The figures are only tentative and refer to a proposed Treasurer, local Audit Staff, Contribution to a Colonial Office Auditor, the future administration of Perim, Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Extra Postal and Telephone staff. Interest on Provident Lund. A tentative provision has been made in the Draft Estimates for this item which does not appear in the annual budget. In the Draft Estimates, the salaries of the Extra Assistant Commissioner (who performs, amongst other duties, those of Treasury Officer) and of the Income Tax Officer have been shown as they are at present. These posts may, however, be revised after the transfer, if a new appointment of Treasurer is created._ - — —-—- ESftySHBH -—,— ■ ——- 26 Draft Estimates based on the figures of Revenue and Expenditure of the AFTER THE Revenue Heads.

(Memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office, 20th May, 1936.) Estimates. It is proposed that there should be two budgets, (A) for the Colony, and (B) for Military and Political or Protectorate matters. (A) Colonial Estimates. —The Revenue would appear under the following main heads:— (1) Income tax. (2) Salt duty. (3) Excise, stamps, fees, and dues. (4) Contribution from Imperial Government. Income tax to be collected under an Ordinance to be passed in the Colony, the rates to be roughly equivalent to the Indian rates now in force in Aden. The contribution from the Imperial Government to include an amount in respect of the Armed Police (towards the cost of which the Treasury contributes £8,000 a year at present) and a part of the salaries and pension liability of the officers performing duties in the Protectorate. The Expenditure would include: — (1) Salaries and passages of the Resident, Political and Civil Secretaries, and Political Officers. (2) Civil Services—Treasury, Justice, Education, Medical, Post Office, Works, etc. (3) Police. (4) Non-effective charges (pensions, etc.). Municipal and Port affairs would remain under the same control as at present, pending further consideration. (B) Protectorate Estimates. —Revenue would consist, initially, wholly of a grant from Imperial Treasury. Expenditure would cover: (1) The Levies. (2) Political expenditure on subsidies, grants, etc., in the Protectorate. (3) Expenditure in Perim. Kamaran would be considered separately; presumably its budget would be self balancing. In any event the administration is maintained primarily in the interests of India. With a view to the inauguration of the new system, it is desirable that a Treasurer or Financial Secretary should be appointed to take up his duties immediately on the transfer; it would be preferable that he should actually arrive in Aden before that date, and Treasury should be asked to provide funds accordingly. He should, besides framing the Estimates and controlling the accounts, be the adviser to the Governor on all financial and monetary questions. It is for consideration whether it will be desirable also to appoint a Legal Adviser. Aden Transfer—(C.21513/54). '50.Aden Transfer—(C.21893/55). 12 and 24. 78128/36 [No. 1]. No. PROOF, THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA (Finance Department) to THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. (Copy received in Colonial Office 30th May, 1936.) Simla, 7th May, 1936. Subject:—Financial adjustments between India and His Majesty’s Government consequent on the separation of Aden from India. Sir, I am directed to forward for information a memorandum on the financial adjust ments between India and His Majesty’s Government consequent on the impending separation of Aden from India and to enquire whether the Secretary of State accepts its conclusions. I have, &amp;c., J. C. NIXON, Secretary to the Government of India. Enclosure in No. Memorandum relating to the Financial Adjustments on the Separation of Aden from India. By Section 288 of the Government of India Act Aden is to be separated from India. The first part of sub-section (5) of that Section has much the same import as that of Section 448 (1) and (2) which applies to Burma. But whereas in the case of Burma there is Section 452 of the Act contemplating a financial adjustment between India and Burma to compensate for any possible unfairness on account of this inevitable division of property and on account of other factors, there is no corresponding clause relating to Aden. However, this omission can hardly affect the proposition that if a financial adjustment between India and His Majesty’s Government consequent on the separation of Aden is equitable, it should be effected. 2. The report of the Indo-Burma Tribunal has now provided a model for the financial adjustments to be undertaken when a country is split up into two parts. But where one of the parts is so small relative to the other as is the case of Aden compared with India, it would be supererogatory to apply all the niceties necessary in the separation of Burma from India. 3. When His Majesty’s Government took over the military control of Aden, the concerned buildings were transferred free of cost. This was in consonance with the practice and conceptions of the Government of India at the time. It has been assumed in past correspondence regarding the separation of Aden that civil buildings would be similarly handed over to His Majesty’s Government free of cost. But if, in view of the new conceptions forced on them by the report of the Indo-Burma Tribunal, a financial adjustment ought to be forthcoming on account of such assets as buildings, then the Government of India would be justified in going back on their previous opinion so far as civil buildings are concerned. The report of the Tribunal on this point, however, does not merely mean that Aden should pay India for the buildings in Aden any more than it means that India should pay Aden for the buildings in India. The report lays down that buildings come into the picture as an asset when calculating the balance of liabilities over assets. Aden ought to assume responsibility for a small fraction of the uncovered debt liability of India. Against this Aden ought to get credit for the fact that there is not in Aden a corresponding fraction of the dead assets of the Government of India. 4. It would, however, suffice in the case of Aden if His Majesty’s Government reimbursed the Government of India for— {a) obligations of the nature of debt specifically referable to Aden at the date of separation, and (b) some portion of the pensionary liabilities arising out of Aden.5. The formerly Indian military land in Aden was made over to the War Office subject to the two following conditions: — {a) the lands were to revert to the Government of India in the event of their ceasing to be utilized for military purposes, and (b) the Government of India was to provide the War Office free of cost with any land in Aden which might subsequently be required by the War Office in connexion with the defence of Aden. These two conditions will naturally lapse upon the separation of Aden. 6. The following were the balances- of civil debt and deposit heads in Aden on 31st March, 1935: — Credits. Rs. as. P- General Provident Fund ... 1,18,962 11 0 I.C.S. Provident Fund (Sterling Branch) 9,219 8 0 Cemetery Endowment Fund ... 7,585 8 8 Revenue deposits 17,518 9 11 Personal deposits: Rs. as.

Assuming that responsibility for all of these items is assumed by the Aden authorities, they involve together a net liability against Aden of about Rs.1-01 lakhs. The present currency chest of the Reserve Bank of India at Aden will be closed and its contents brought back to India. 7 7. The item of Rs.5 lakhs above is the outstanding balance of a loan of Rs.10 lakhs drawn in 1925-26 by the Aden Settlement Fund for an electric supply project. The loan is at present carrying a rate of interest of 6| per cent. The local authority maintains an invested sinking fund for the eventual repayment of this debt. Its annual contribu tion to the fund is about Rs.45,000. In December, 1933, the balance in the sinking fund was just over Rs.50,000.3 8. In regard to the Posts and Telegraphs Department there are certain adjustments to be taken into account. The capital account of that Department corresponds to an identifiable item in the public debt of India. The figures for Aden on 31st March, 1935, were— Capital outlay (i.e., depreciated value of assets as on 1st April, 1925, plus cost value subsequently): — (1) Post Office buildings at Steamer Point, Aden and Khomaksar ... ... 1-55 (2) Aden telephone exchange ... ... ... T57 Rs.3T2 lakhs. Less depreciation ...... ... ... ... ... -19 ,, # Net 2-93 This sum would be due by Aden to India. (The figures exclude the value of land as this is not borne on the block.) 9. Other items under Posts and Telegraphs which would require adjustment, as they stood on 31st March, 1935, are— {a) Savings Bank Deposits. (The Government of India will be responsible for any Indian savings bank accounts dead before the date of separation) .... , ... Rs.4-48 lakhs. {b) Provident Fund Deposits ... ... ... ,, -15 ,, (c) Cash in the hands of Postmasters ... ... ... ... ,, -19 ,, The first two items would stand to the debit of Aden and the last to its credit. That is, between them they constitute a liability of value Rs.4-44 lakhs. Any balance of unpaid foreign money orders outstanding on the date of separation would also have to be adjusted. The amount will be small. It was only about Rs.450 on 31st March, 1935. The clearance of certain suspense heads (which show a credit of about Rs.4,750 to Aden on 31st March, 1935) might also involve adjustable items. 10. For the following elements, presumably adjustments will have periodically to be done through an exchange account and in consequence they need not be considered as coming into the separation question— Payment of Indian Post Office Cash Certificates. Money orders with India. Receipts and payments on account of Indian Postal life insurants. 11. The pensionary liabilities of Aden fall into the following categories : — {a) pensions in issue on the date of separation for service wholly in Aden (i) payable in Aden, and (ii) payable in India or elsewhere; (6) pensions in issue outside Aden on the date of separation covering part-time service in Aden; (c) future pensions arising out of whole time service in Aden; (d) future pensions arising out of part time service (whether before or afteu separation) in Aden. Of these, in the civil class, Aden will continue to disburse (a) (i) amounting at present to about Rs. 17,000 a year. (There is one pensioner who never served Aden drawing a pension from the Aden Treasury. The commuted value of his pension on 31st March, 1935, was about Rs.3,650 and Aden would be due to obtain a credit for this sum.) Aden will naturally become responsible for (c). Aden should in future meet the part of {d) on the basis of length of service referable to service in Aden. There is no practical manner of apportioning (6) and Aden will have to be exonerated from bearing any share of that class. Class {a) covers mainly subordinate personnel. As regards {a) (ii), five pensioners of the Aden Police department have been identified who draw their pensions at Barabera in Somaliland. Their charge amounts to about Rs. 1,000 a year. After separation Aden will bear this debit direct. Five other persons drawing pensions in India for whole time service in Aden have been identified. The commuted value of the pensions drawn by these as on 31st March, 1935, is about Rs.56,000. This sum would be debitable to Aden in a financial settlement upon separation.4 12. As regards pensions arising out of the Posts and Telegraphs department in Aden, any which were sanctioned before 1st April, 1921, would appear among civil pensions. It is unlikely that any which matter exist now. For the rest, only four pensioners have so far been discovered. One person is drawing a pension of Rs.37-11 a month in Aden for whole time service in Aden. Aden after separation will be responsible for this. Another is drawing a pension in Aden of Rs. 115-2 a month although he did not spend his v whole service there. Aden would obtain a credit for the capitalized amount of his pension ascribable on a time basis to his service out of Aden. Two other pensioners have been found in India who spent their whole service in the Posts and Telegraphs Department in Aden. The capitalized value of their pensions on 31st March, 1935, was about Rs. 15,300 which would be a debit in a financial settlement to Aden. 13. If, particularly in the Posts and telegraphs Department, personnel to serve in Aden cannot be obtained from the present services and in consequence the Government of India have to abolish some posts and pay compensation to individuals thereby, the compensation element would be due to be debited to the account of Aden. nmary (in Rs. lakhs) of the items mentioned above is as follows::— Liabilities by Aden to India. Paragraph 6 101 „ 8 ,.. 2-93 „ H •56 „ 12 ... •15 4-65 Liabilities by India to Aden. Paragraph 9 4-44 ,, 11 ,.. •04 . 4-48 Net amount due to India Rs.-17 lakhs-. I t 1^ If the cash balance in the treasury is above the normal figure on the date of separation, the difference will be taken to the currency chest. Under the terms of the Aden Settlement Fund Loan, India can claim nothing from the sinking fund before the date of separation. The amount of actual cash adjustment as on the date of separation is not likely to be a figure out of order with the figure at the end of the last paragraph. In view of the fact that as an outcome of separation India will save (according to the 1935-36 budget figures) Rs.16 lakhs a year on the military budget alone, it is not worth while India’s demanding payment of such a relatively small sum as this. It will therefore not be necessary to recalculate the position as on the actual date of separation. But it will be well to render the account set out in this memorandum as a record of the sums involved, and so that His Majesty’s Government and the Departments of the Government of India, and especially the Accounts Department mav understand the position. J 16. It may then be laid down that all pensions in issue in Aden on the date of separation will be borne by Aden, while pensions payable in India which cover the whole time or part time service in Aden will be borne by India. Any pensions payable outside India or Aden for whole time service in Aden will be borne by Aden which will however be relieved from bearing any share of such pensions if they cover only part time service m Aden Pensions sanctioned after separation will be allocated between Aden and India on the basis of length of service.PROOF. 78127/36 [No. 1]. No. TRANSFER OF ADEN. Proposals for Discussion with Sir Bernard Reilly. (Memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office, 20th May, 1936.) Personnel. It is contemplated that all officers at present serving in Aden should be offered appointment under the Colonial Government on the same terms as to salary, leave, passages, etc., as they at present enjoy. As to discipline, they would come under the Colonial Regulations. Those not wishing to accept appointment would either be transferred to service in India or retired on such pension from India as they have earned. Officers retained in the service of the Colony of Aden would preserve their pension rights from India, and (if pensionable) would ultimately receive pensions in respect of their service under the Colony at rates not less than they would have earned if Aden had remained a part of India. Pension in respect of service up to the date of transfer would ultimately be paid from Indian funds. Officers newly engaged by the Colonial Government, or promoted to higher posts, will come on such terms of service, including pension rights, as may be fixed by the Government of Aden with the approval of the Secretary of State. Subject to the concurrence of the India Office and the Treasury, it is suggested that the Resident should issue a notification to all officers on the above lines shortly before transfer takes place. Salaries, etc., will be provided in the annual estimates and will not require special legislation. Draft pension legislation is under consideration, and will have to contain provision for the calculation of the pensions of officers retained in the service of the Colony and already having pensionable status.

No. 1. INDIA OFFICE to COLONIAL OFFICE. (Very Secret.) India Office, Whitehall, Sir, London, S.W.l, 2nd February, 1933. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that in connexion with the forthcoming constitutional legislation he has had under consideration the question of the future of Aden, and that he has thought it desirable to invite the views of the Government of India on the question of taking steps to separate the Settlement from India. 2. To enable them to consider the question further the Government of India are anxious for an indication of the views of His Majesty’s Government on the follow ing five points. They ask whether in the event of separation His Majesty’s Govern ment would be prepared to— (a) relieve India of the contribution at present paid towards the military and political administration; (b) maintain the policy of making Aden a free port; (c) assume liability for the difference between revenue and administrative charges without imposing additional taxation or reducing the standard of administration. The present difference, on the basis of figures for 1929-30 to 1931-32, averages about &lt;£2,000 per annum, but will probably be more than covered by additional income tax receipts from certain Aden firms which now pay all their income tax in India instead of Aden; (d) retain a proportion of Indian Service administrative personnel in Aden service for some years after transfer takes place; (e) agree to the retention of the right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court, if this is found to be administratively and legally possible. 3. The Secretary of State would suggest that the simplest course would be that the Government of India’s inquiries should be considered in the Standing Aden Com mittee at the earliest possible date, and if Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister agrees he would suggest that a meeting might be arranged, if possible, on Monday, 6th February. The Government of India are committed to consulting the Indian Legislature and the interests concerned before any action can be taken in regard to the future of Aden, and since it is important to reach a decision in time for its announcement, if necessary, as part of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government on Indian Constitutional ques tions! which are to be laid before Parliament in the course of the spring, it is, as will be appreciated, of the first importance to clear the ground with the minimum of delay. 4. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Treasury, Air Ministry, Admiralty, and War Office. I am, &amp;c., J. C. WALTON.17960/33 [No. 18]. No. 2. ADEN STANDING COMMITTEE. Minutes of the Nineteenth Meeting held on the 10th February, 1933, at the Colonial Office. Present: Mr. H. E. Cowell, C.M.G. (In the Chair), Colonial Office. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite } . Mr. G. E. Crombie j India Office. Mr. E. A. Grieve, O.B.E., Treasury. Group-Captain E. E. C. Peirse, D.S.O., A.F.C., Air Ministry. Commander J. W. Eivett-Carnac, D.S.C., Admiralty. Lieutenant-Colonel G. B. Henderson Uy Office. Mr. A. Earl, C.B.E. Mr. S. I. James, Secretary. Mr. Cowell said that the meeting had been called to hold a preliminary dis cussion regarding the future of Aden in connexion with the forthcoming legislation in respect of India. The whole question had been reopened by a letter* fiom the India Office (copies of which had been sent to the Departments represented on^ the Committee), in which they said that the Government of India had asked for the \iews of His Majesty’s Government on certain points in order that they might further con sider the question of the separation of the Aden settlement from India. ^ The Govern ment of India had asked whether in the event of separation His Majesty s Government would be prepared to :— (a) relieve India of the contribution at present paid towards the military and political administration; (b) maintain the policy of making Aden a free port; (c) assume liability for the difference between revenue and administrative charges without imposing additional taxation or reducing the standard of administration; (d) retain a proportion of Indian Service administrative personnel in Aden service for some years after transfer takes place; (e) agree to the retention of the right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court, if this is found to be administratively and legally possible. Mr. Cowell said that he had discussed the whole question with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and that his views on the various points were as follows : (a) This was a financial question which must be left to the Treasury. (b) In view of the great importance at present attached to tariff considerations, the Secretary of State would not be prepared to bind himself to maintain Aden as a free port indefinitely, although in all probability it would remain so in practice. (c) This is for the Treasury to decide, but if they are willing to meet the annual deficit in the administration of the settlement, the Colonial Office could undertake to maintain the existing standard of administration without in creasing the burden of taxation. Such an undertaking would, however, be expressly liable to reconsideration in the event of any fundamental change of circumstances. (d) This would clearly be to our advantage, and we should probably undertake to retain for a fixed period of years the Indian Service personnel in all posts in Aden in which they are at present employed. After which, the gradual substitution of Colonial Service officials in the Aden Service would be considered. Indians would, of course, remain eligible for appointment to such posts. (e) There would be no objection to this, which would probably be the most convenient arrangement. On the general question, the Secretary of State considered that it would be prefer able for Aden to be under one administration, but if it were decided that the Govern ment of India should make no further contribution to the military and political expenses, he would feel some doubt about approaching Parliament for the vote of such a considerable sum of money merely to alleviate administrative difficulties. He would require an assurance that there would be no interference on the part of the Government of India. «Mr. Cowell said that it had also been suggested that an assurance would be required from His Majesty’s Government that, if the Aden Settlement passed to their control, there would be no racial discrimination. There should be no difficulty about this. Mr. Laithwaite said the question of the transfer of Aden to His Majesty’s Government had been raised with the Government of India, partly as the result of informal discussion with members of the interested Departments here. The Secretary of State and the Government of India were as yet uncommitted on the subject, and it would be necessary for the latter to consult the Indian Legislature and the interests involved before a final decision could be taken. The question was a controversial one in India, and any proposal for transfer would certainly be the subject of severe criticism in the Indian Legislature. There were two chief difficulties :— (1) The Bombay commercial interests in Aden were very apprehensive that if the Settlement passed from Indian control, their interests would not be properly looked after. Assurances on points (6) to (e) should go a long way to remove their objections, but Mr. Laithwaite was inclined to think that some more definite guarantee than that contemplated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies would be desirable as regards the maintenance of Aden as a free port. (2) The transfer would be unpopular in any circumstances. But its un popularity would be enormously aggravated if there were to be any;, ques tions of coupling it with the retention of any Indian financial contribution. In the Secretary of State’s view it would be politically impossible to main tain any contribution in the event of transfer. A contribution could indeed be imposed and the money would be non-votable, but the item would be open for debate annually in the Indian legislature and the pressure for its abandonment would be exceedingly difficult to resist. With regard to the question of maintaining Aden as a free port, Mr. Cowell intimated that if there were a possibility of deadlock on this point, it would probably be possible to devise some formula to satisfy both sides. Mr. Laithwaite explained that the need for a decision was urgent, as it was desired to deal with the question in the White Paper which was to be issued at the end of March. Mr. Grieve emphasized the importance of reaching a decision now that the whole question of the future constitution of India was in the melting pot, and of not allowing the Aden question to go by default. He explained that, although it had been suggested that members of the Committee should be in a position to represent the views of their respective' Ministers, it was quite impossible for him to refer the matter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer at this stage. He pointed out that this was a case in which the Chancellor must reserve his view until the various political and strategic considerations had been advanced by the Departments concerned. It was, he urged, for the other Departments to submit views to the Cabinet to which the Chancellor could speak. He could not, therefore, at this stage give any opinion as to what the Treasury attitude would be. It was suggested that India might pay a fixed sum (probably less than the present maximum of £150,000 per annum) for a definite period of, say, 10 years. Mr. Laithwaite, however, thought that there could be no question in any circum stances of an Indian contribution in the event of transfer, save possibly as part of a general arrangement in which all portions of the Empire interested in the position of Aden would participate. Group Captain Peirse said that the Air Ministry had never been satisfied with the present arrangement, and recalled the difficulties which had arisen at the time of the operations against the Imam in 1928. The transfer of Aden to the Home Government misfit, of course, involve an extra burden on air votes of some £85,000 (at present contributed by India), but this was a matter foi the Treasury. From the point of view of speed and efficiency of administration, the Air Ministry had always advocated the change. Lieutenant-Colonel Henderson said that, although there was only a relatively small military contingent in Aden, the War Office agreed with the Air Ministry as to the desirability of having Aden under one administration. Mr. Earl endorsed this view and said that, although the change would mean additional expenditure by the War Office of about £16,000, strategic interests must take precedence over financial ones.4 At this point there emerged an aspect of the question which was new to the majority of the members of the Committee. This was that, if under the new Constitu tion, Aden remained a part of India, the existing arrangements, failing special pro vision, might not be continued and military control of the Settlement might revert to the Government of India. Group Captain Peirse at once stated that this possibility entirely altered the situation, since the Air Ministry could not contemplate military control of Aden passing from the Imperial Government. He, therefore, suggested that the India Office should restate the position likely to result from the constitutional changes in India. It was generally agreed that in the new circumstances an added importance was given to the need for arriving at a satisfactory settlement as to the future administra tion of Aden under the new Constitution. In reply to a question, Mr. Laithwaite explained that defence and external affairs would, under the new Constitution, be reserved to the Governor-General. Mr. Cowell said that the port of Aden was a vital link in Imperial communica tions, and he suggested that it might not suit Admiralty requirements if the defence of the port was taken out of the hands of His Majesty’s Government, since, in that case, the port would be in the same position as any other port in India. Commander Rivett-Carnac said that he had not come prepared to represent his Department’s views on the wider issue which had been now raised. Speaking personally, he thought the Admiralty would, in the new conditions adumbrated, oppose the resumption by India of responsibility for the defence of Aden. Aden was an Essential fuelling port and base on the lines of communication to the Far East; and if India obtained a greater degree of self-government its retention under Imperial control as an additional base for the East Indies Squadron would acquire added importance. Group' Captain Peirse said that the defence of the Protectorate w T ould become more difficult still, if agreement had to be reached with the authorities in India on every step which had to be taken. The Air Ministry had never contemplated such an event, and the possibility of such conditions would clearly strengthen their view that it was desirable for Aden to become the entire responsibility of His Majesty’s Govern ment. Mr. Cowell said he imagined that we should be able to maintain our relations with the tribes of the Protectorate, provided that, as he supposed would be the case, we should be allowed to retain certain Political and Military Officers in Aden itself. At the same time, our interest in the Protectorate was only part of the defence scheme of the port of Aden. It seemed more than probable that if the defence of Aden became the concern of the authorities in India, considerable friction, if not in efficiency, might result. After general discussion, it became clear that the crux of the problem was the defence of the port of Aden, and the question was whether the risks involved in the possible retransfer, now or at a later stage, of military control at Aden to the Indian Federation were such as could be faced. The following conclusion was eventually reached :— The India Office would prepare a memorandum for the Cabinet, setting out what the position was likely to be on the establishment of the Indian Federation as regards the exercise of military control at Aden, while the Admiralty and Air Ministry would submit a memorandum describing the strategic importance of the port of Aden and marshalling the arguments against the transfer of its military and political control to the Government of India. Mr. Cowell said that it did not appear necessary for the Colonial Office to put up a separate memorandum, since the political relations with the Protectorate tribes was only a minor aspect of the matter and was in fact only part of the defence question. 17968 33 [No. 1]. No. 3. MR. J. G. LAITHWAITE (India Office) to MR. H. R. COWELL (Colonial Office). [Answered by No. 4.] My dear Cowell, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l, 21st April, 1933. I enclose a copy of an air mail letter from the Government of India, together with the enclosure in original. As you will see, it is proposed to replace the Aden&lt;3 5 Civil and Criminal Justice Act, 1864 (and certain amending Acts), by a Regulation making provision for the administration of justice at Aden by Courts both Civil and Criminal. The change is, I understand, no more than a matter of procedure and raises no question of substance, and it is suggested solely consequent on the recent transfer of the administrative control of Aden from the Government of Bombay to the Govern ment of India and the establishment of Aden as a Chief Commissioner’s province. I do not imagine that you will be very actively interested and write only to say that we propose, subject to any comments you may wish to make, to submit the Government of India’s recommendation for approval. If you feel doubt on any point perhaps you would let me know and we might discuss it. Yours, &amp;c., J. G. LAITHWAITE. Enclosure in No. 8. Government of India. Home Department. (Confidential.) 112 (No. p 670/32—Judl.) New Delhi, the 3rd April, 1933. To His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London. As a result of transfer of control of Aden to Government of India, Chief Commissioner has suggested a draft Regulation to replace Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Act, 1864. Draft has been revised by Government of India and a copy of revised draft is enclosed. It is being forwarded to Chief Commissioner to be examined and if necessary further revised. Chief Commissioner and Government of Bombay consider, and we agree, that this is an urgent measure which should be promulgated as soon as possible. Meanwhile as you are aware question of separation of Aden from British India is under consideration. Bombay Government consider it desirable that draft should be issued before this separation takes effect. We agree and would be glad to know by telegram whether you see any objection to this course. (Sd.) Joint Secretary to the Government of India. 17968/83 [ No. 2]. No. 4. MR. H. R. COWELL (Colonial Office) to MR. J. G. LAITH WAITE (India Office). [Answered by No. 5.] Dear Laithwaite, Downing Street, S.W.l, 6th May, 1933 Thank you for your letter of the 21st of April,* regarding the draft Regulation to replace the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Act, 1864, and certain amending Act:-:.. The intention of Section 23 of the draft Regulations is not altogether cleai to us, but we assume that the object is merely to assist the Somaliland Courts by enabling their decrees to be enforced against persons or property within the jurisdiction of the * No. 3.6 Aden Courts. If this is correct, we have no objection to the Section. Apart from this, we have no comments to offer on the draft, which I return herewith. The point has, however, been raised whether, if we take over Aden, we should be free to make whatever provision seemed proper to the Secretary of State in regard to procedure prior to appeal to the Bombay Courts. Roberts Wray assumes that this would be so; but you suggested that there might be, for all you knew, some technical difficulty. Perhaps you would ask Chamier about this? Yours, &amp;c., H. E. COWELL. 17988/33 [No. 3]. No. 5. ME. J. G. LAITHWAITE (India Office) to ME. H. E. COWELL (Colonial Office). My dear Cowell, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l, 9th May, 1933. Many thanks for your letter of the 6th May,* about the draft Regulation to replace the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Act, 1864, &amp;c. The assumption in the second paragraph of your letter is correct. As regards the point in the last paragraph, I enclose a note by Sir Edward Chamier. We have not yet, as you know, considered in any detail the procedure to be adopted in connexion with the various details of the transfer of Aden. From what he says there seems, however, no reason to anticipate that any difficulty will arise over the matter in which you are interested. Yours, &amp;c., J. G. LAITH WAITE. Enclosure in No. 5. Note by Sir Edward Chamier. When the island of St. Helena was made over to the Home Government and again when the Straits Settlements were made over to the Home Government statutory provision was made for the future government of the territories and for legislation by Order in Council, see 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 85, Section 112, and 29 and 30 Viet, c. 115, Sections 1 and 2. Some such provision will be made in the case of Aden. I understand that in some way or other, it is intended to provide that the right of appeal to the Bombay High Court shall continue but I do not know whether this provision is to be made by the Statute itself or by Order in Council made under the Statute. In either case the Home Government will be able to make such provision as it thinks proper regarding procedure prior to appeal to the Bombay High Court. I see no reason for any difficulty about this. E. Chamier, 8th May, 1933. 17960/33 [No. 24]. No. 6. INDIA OFFICE to COLONIAL OFFICE. Sir, India Office, 17th May, 1933. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit to you, for the information of the Under-Secretary of State, Colonial' Office, copy of a telegram from * No. 4.i the Secretary of State to the Government of India and two letters from the Chief Commissioner for Aden on the subject of the Aden administration. I am, &amp;c., S. F. STEWART. Reference to previous correspondence : Letter from the India Office of the 29th March, 1933 * Copy also sent to Treasury. Enclosure 1 in No. 6. Sir. (Confidential.) (No. C/215.) The Residency, Aden, 18th April, 1933. Future of Aden. I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter addressed to me by Mr. Framroze Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw, and of its accompaniment, a copy of a resolution passed at a meeting convened in connexion with the future of Aden. 2. Mr. Framroze Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw is the local head of the principal Indian (Parsee) firm in Aden. He has informed me that he has heard from a private source in India that the separation of Aden from India is contemplated, and that he therefore called this meeting in the hope of preventing it. I understand that it was attended by both Indians and Arabs. I told Mr. Framroze Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw that I was prepared to forward to Government any considered resolution passed by a representative meeting, and I accordingly do so, with my comments. 3. It will be seen that the sense of the meeting was opposed to a transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office on general grounds, and particularly on account of its- anticipated, effect on the local salt industry, on post and telegraph charges, on the cost of administration, and on the method of government. 4 The future administration of Aden is an Imperial question of more than local concern, but I trust local interests will receive full consideration in any decision that is taken with regard to it. 5. The danger to the salt business of Aden if it loses the protection of the Indian salt tariff is obvious, and will be serious, especially in view of the severe competition of the recently established salt works at Ras Hafun m Italian Somaliland I he pro duction of salt is Aden’s only important industry, and a setback to it will MIect very adversely not only the firms concerned but also Government revenue from income tax and royalties, and will cause a certain amount of local unemployment. It is therefore to be hoped that, whatever may be decided with regard to the future of Aden, means will be devised to safeguard the prosperity of its salt business. 6. I trust that the meeting’s fears on other points will prove to be ill-founded and that it will not be necessary to impose additional burdens on the community. I am of opinion that a change in the control of Aden need not, and ought not, involve any serious alterations in the existing system of administration, at any rate for several years; and that new taxation, new laws and a multiplication of new officmls should be avoided. An official assurance to this effect would go far to allay misgivings with regard to a possible change of control if His Majesty’s Government and the Govern ment of India decide on making one. I have, &amp;c., B. R. Reilly, Chief Commissioner. To the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi. Sir, ~ Aden, 17th April, 1933. Proposed Transfer of Aden to Colonial Office. A largely attended meeting of Arab and Indian citizens was held yesterday evening under my presidentship to consider this question, when those assem unanimously gave their verdict against the transfer and passed a lesouion, a PY * 17960/33 [No. 22] : not printed.s •of which I am forwarding you under instructions received. I am asked to request that you will be so good as to forward this resolution to proper quarters with such remarks in support thereof as you may deem necessary in the interests of those to whom this question most concerns, viz., the mercantile community of Aden comprised of Indian and Arab traders and merchants. I understand that the Jews as a community entertain similar ideas as those expressed in the resolution, but were unable to attend the meeting on account of some festivities. I have, &amp;c., Framroze H. C. Dinshaw. The Chief Commissioner, Aden. Resolution. This meeting of Arab and Indian citizens of Aden view with alarm the contem plated transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office, which if carried into effect would not fulfil the pledges given by the Government of India through its accredited representa tives from time to time. The transfer would be highly detrimental to the residents of Aden, as they would be cut off from their Indian connexion which has proved so far beneficial. The Colonial Government, it is feared, will not be able or willing to look after their welfare as can be expected from India in which they are represented in the legislatures. The salt protection duty of the Government of India has materially helped the salt industry to this place and which will automatically cease to exist immediately her connexion with India is severed. The bulk of the business is in the hands of Indians, to whose wants the Colonial Office cannot show the same sympathy as can be expected from the present Government. Postage and telegraph rates will also go up automatically. Expenditure it is feared will be doubled or even trebled by high paid English officers being imported direct, as is at present being done in British Somaliland, and to meet which customs and other duties will be levied, to the detriment of the trade of this port, which is already dwindling. It is also feared that landlords will be materially affected by the change, as different laws and regulations foreign to the citizens will be applied to Aden. Further, this meeting strongly supports the various representations made by public bodies to the Government of India and the emphatic protests they had received from different quarters which now stand as good and strong as when they were made. The news has caused surprise to Arab and Indian merchants, who have played an important part towards the development of Aden ever since its conquest in 1839 and who have very large vested interests in Aden. This meeting also reminds the Government of India of the assurances they gave in the Council of State and prays that the Governor-General will, in the interests of the Arab and Indian citizens of this port take up the same position his Government rightly took up a few years back when this question was raised, and the step fraught as it is with far-reaching consequences to the well-being of the inhabitants of this place will it is hoped not be allowed to be carried out without consulting the people most concerned and without giving the Indian Legislature an opportunity to examine it in all its bearings. This meeting requests that the Chief Commissioner of Aden will kindly impress upon the Imperial Government, as well as the Government of India, that the transfer will be highly detrimental to the interests of Aden. Enclosure 2 in No. 6. (Confidential.) Sir, The Residency, Aden, 19th April, 1933. Future of Aden. I have the honour to forward a translation of a letter which has been addressed to me by a number of the leading Arab residents in Aden on the subject of the possible transfer of the administration of Aden from the Government of India to the Colonial Office. This expression of their views is a direct result of the meeting held a few days ago under the auspices of Mr. Framroze Hormusjee Cowasjee Dinshaw, which was reported to you in my letter No. C/215 dated 18th April, 1933.9 2. In my opinion the letter represents the real opinion of intelligent members of the Arab community, which, as you are aware, forms the majority of the population of the Settlement of Aden. They regard with considerable apprehension the possibility of the inclusion of Aden in a self-governing Indian Federation, and the consequent prospect of an Indian domination over an Arab town. The Aden Arabs are extremely conservative, and they desire as little change as possible in the existing administration of the Settlement. This sentiment is expressed under the headings (1), (2), and (3) in their letter. Of these the first, namely, the continuance of Aden as a free port, is, in my opinion, vital to the prosperity of the place, which is based on its transit trade. I understand their heading (4) to refer to their desire that Government posts in Aden should, as far as possible, be filled by local recruitment. I have, &amp;c., B. B. Reilly, Chief Commissioner. The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. (Translation.) After Compliments, Aden, 18th April, 1933. There are reports and rumours of the intending transfer of Aden to the Colonial Government. The Indians have held a meeting to protest against this transfer. As the majority of the people of Aden are Arabs to whom this question is more important than to any other community, we thought it better to express our opinion on it. We have no objection to the transfer of Aden to the Colonial Government if (1) the Port will remain free, i.e., no tariff will be imposed on exports and imports; (2) if taxes in general will remain as they are if not reduced having regard to changed conditions; (3) if the laws and local rules will remain as they are unless it is considered necessary to alter some of them in the interest of the place; (4) the rights of the people remain as they are, if not improved upon; the people to have a prior right to Government posts and appointments, &amp;c. If this is not possible, Aden may form part of the “ Reserved Area,” i.e., under the Governor-General of India. We have confidence in our Governor, Colonel Reilly, as we consider him to be one of us. If he will remain for ever a Governor of Aden, we would accept any Government without reservations, but alas he will have to go one day from Aden. 32 signatories. To H.E. Colonel Reilly, C.I.E., O.B.E., Chief Commissioner, Aden. Enclosure 3 in No. 6. From Secretary of State to Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. (Dated 15th May, 1933.) Telegram. (Secret.) 1196. Aden. Reilly has shown me his letters to you of 18th and 19th April regarding representations from Indians and Arabs. I understand that he fears that local agitation against transfer will grow unless the proposed safeguards are made known at an early date. Inquiries as to future arrangements are also beginning to be made here, and if we are pressed in Parliament it may, before long, become difficult to withhold information of what is contemplated. It seems preferable that first announcement should be made in India. Though I realize that natural occasion for this would be debate in Legislative Assembly, I am impressed by desirability of an early statement with a view to indicating assurances which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give in event of separation, and thus forestalling propaganda based on ignorance of these assurances. Would it be possible to take the opportunity of representations submitted to Reilly to make announcement, which could indicate that10 full opportunity would be given for discussion in Legislature in due couise, and that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give the assurances covered by my telegram of 25th March last, No. 798? Matter appears urgent for reason given by Reilly and because we may have Parliamentary questions in near future. Addressed Government of India, No. 1196. Repeated Aden, No. 1197. 17960/33 [No. 26].

As regards main question whether Aden should be removed from control of Government of India when latter becomes responsible to Indian electorate instead of to British Parliament, we feel that there is much to be said on both sides, and that we cannot commit ourselves to any opinion until discussions, to which we are pledged, have taken place in Legislative Assembly and we have heard and considered what Indian public opinion have (sic ? has) to say. 3. It was not possible during last session of the Assembly to allot special time for discussion of the question, and our expectation that it might be raised during debate on the White Paper was not fulfilled. Discussion must therefore be postponed until September session, but meanwhile we suggest it might be raised before Joint Select Committee in London. Indian “ participators ” are a very representative body and include several members of the Legislative Assembly, while, possibly for this purpose, members of the Legislatures sent for Reserve Bank and Railway Board discussions might be added. Select witnesses on behalf of Indian interests in Aden might also be called. We would suggest that in such discussions Government spokesmen should take the line that, for reasons explained in paragraph No. 3 of your telegram, 9th March, 630, His Majesty’s Government are considering the question of separating Aden from India on or before the date of federation, and are therefore anxious to elicit Indian opinion on the subject before making up their minds. The countervailing advantages and safeguards to accompany separation, as detailed in your telegram 798, should also be explained, in order that Indian opinion may appreciate that there are two sides of the question, even from the Indian point of view. 4. Our views on subsidiary question, as to when and how separation should be effected, cannot be formulated until discussions have taken place and main question is decided. We would, therefore, recommend that His Majesty’s Government should, if they think it necessary, merely take power in Government of India Bill to separate Aden by Order in Council, as suggested in your telegram of 7th January, 57.11 * No. 6. 17960/33 LNo. 27].

Following is proposed text of announcement: Begins:—His Majesty’s Government have recently received representations from Various communities amongst inhabitants of Aden, on the one hand pro testing against and on the other, advocating transfer of administration fiom contiol of Government of India to His Majesty’s Government. The matter is one which is now receiving consideration of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India in connexion with impending constitutional changes. It is clear that no decision can be reached until Indian Legislature and other interests have had an opportunity of stating their views and those views have been considered. It is proposed to initiate discussions on subjects both before Joint belect Committee and subsequently at (? next) session of Indian Legislative Chambers. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government think that it would be convenient that considerations which suggest desirability of a transfer of administration and conditions that would be entailed by such a transfer, should be made known, so that problem can be discussed with full knowledge of the facts. _ The reasons which suggest that Aden should not remain linked with India under the new Constitution are, that it is an area geographically remote from India; that it would not naturally fit into the new federation, that it is already to some extent under Imperial control, and that it is inseparable in practice from Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of India control. If12 * No. 8. it should be decided that the administration of Aden should be separated from that of India, His Majesty’s Government contemplate that the following con ditions would be established: (1) India would be relieved of annual contribution approximately £150,000 sterling, or B,s.20 lakhs, at present payable towards military and political administration. (2) The right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay High Court would be maintained if this arrangement were found to be administratively and legally * possible. (3) His Majesty’s Government would maintain existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in present economic situation should take place. The prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transhipment trade, so that abandonment of policy of a free port would obviously be against its financial interests. (4) His Majesty’s Government would do their utmost to maintain present standard of administration and would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became, in their opinion, absolutely necessary. (5) A proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place. (6) No racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty’s Government. 17980/33 [No. 28]. No. 9. INDIA OFFICE to COLONIAL OFFICE. India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.l, Bib, 30th May, 1933. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to 'the telegraiphic correspondence with the Government of India (ending with their telegram of 22nd May, copy of which was forwarded to the Colonial Office under India Office letter of 23rd May,* relative to the question of the separation of Aden from India, and the proposal to make an announcement of the assurances which His Majesty’s Govern ment are prepared to give in the event of separation taking place. 2. The object of the proposed announcement is to prevent the growth at Aden and in India of agitation against transfer. Colonel Reilly, the Chief Commissioner, who is now on leave in this country, fears that, unless an announcement is shortly made, propaganda against transfer may make great headway at Aden, and may gain many adherents among the Arab population, as well as among Indians, as a result of ignorance of the conditions of transfer to which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree. 3. Subject to the views of Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare would propose to authorize an announcement m the terms set out in the Government of India’s telegram, No. 1289, subject to the alterations which he has suggested to them in the telegram of which copy is enclosed.

I feel it would be undesirable for His Majesty’s Govern ment to raise separation of Aden as an issue before the Committee. It may be raised by Indian delegates after announcement and Committee may discuss it. But it is probable that it would decline to hear special evidence on the subject. 2. I appreciate Government of India’s inability to commit themselves to any 'opinion until matter is discussed in Legislative Assembly and public opinion elicited.13 * Enclosure in No. 3. 3. In the meantime, however, I agree that an announcement should be made simultaneously at Aden, in India, and in this country on the lines of your telegram 1289. I propose to make it here in answer to a question m Parliament and do not wish to be apologetic about it. I am consulting Colonial Office and Treasury as to proposed text, and will then telegraph further. Meanwhile please telegraph whether you agree to the following alterations (1) in first sentence substitute “ deprecating for “protecting against”; (2) substitute the following for the third and fourth sentences from “ It is clear that ” to “ Chambers.” Begins :—Full opportunity will be given for discussion in the Indian Legislative Chambers at their next session and for all the interests concerned to state their views.—Ends.

I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 1489 of the 17th June, 1933, on the subject of the proposed transfer of the Administration of Aden to the control of His Majesty’s Government. 2. During the past week, a sufficient time having elapsed since the publication of the Announcement on the 20th June, 1933, I have invited the opinions of thirteen leading and influential Arabs on this matter, in a series of private and informal inter views. My informants were especially selected as representative of religious (Moslem), commercial (wholesale, retail, and transit trade), and real estate interests in Aden; and they are well qualified to voice the genuine opinion of all classes of the Arab community, owing both to their own comparatively enlightened understanding of the issues involved and to their influence over and acquaintance with the less intelligent attitude of the lower orders. 3. The impression that I have received from these frank and friendly conversa tions is that the Arab community in Aden as a whole are satisfied and content under the existing political and administrative conditions, but that they view with grave mis giving the possibility of “ Indianization ” of the government of Aden consequent upon constitutional changes in India. Representing an overwhelming racial majority in territory that is geographically and historically an integral part of Arabia, they fear the subordination of Arab and Indian interests, and they forsee an increase in the commercial domination of Indian firms in Aden, if the Settlement is to remain under the control of an increasingly self-governing India.18 4. On the other hand, while they are acquiescent in the prospect of transfer and reliant on the honesty of the intentions and purposes of His Majesty’s Govern ment, they are characteristically apprehensive of change, and are not confident that that which is now contemplated will be to their social or material advantage. As one of my visitors expressed himself— tc We are warm in this fire. Shall we perhaps be burned in another? ” 5. The following particular points have emerged in the course of my conversa- ^ tions in regard to the Announcement:— ' Condition 1.—There is a ‘ c bazaar rumour ” widely believed among uneducated Arabs, that the annual contribution of Rs.20 lakhs of which India would be relieved, will be borne by Aden. Enlightened classes are not free from this suspicion, and it has been suggested,to me that this misapprehension should be removed by the issue of a further and clearer Announcement in this regard. Conditions 3 and 4.—While intelligent opinion understands that His Majesty’s Government would be unable, at the present, or perhaps at any, juncture, to bind themselves unconditionally to the maintenance of the existing fiscal policy in Aden, there is general disappointment that a more definite statement has not been made on these issues. Miscellaneous. —Religious circles profess to be preoccupied with the need for the administration of the Sher’ia Law in Aden according to the Shafe’i doctrine, which is followed by practically all the Arab Moslem community. It appears, how ever, that Arab opinion generally is satisfied with Indian Law in that respect'which follows the Hanafi doctrine; and I think that the contention of the ’Ulema represents a pious hope for the future, rather than an argument for or against transfer. 6. _ The publication of the Announcement has had the desired effect of crystalliz ing the issues at stake, and has tended to confine controversy to the conditions with which it dealt; and while it has not prevented the exchange of irresponsible rumours in the bazaars, there is no evidence that these rumours have their source in propaganda directed by (Indian commercial) circles which are still uncompromisingly hostile to transfer. 7The sense of this appreciation has been generally confirmed by official and unofficial observers whom I have consulted in the matter, and whose activities bring them into close touch with the Arab community in Aden. The situation will continue to be closely watched, and developments will be reported to you from time to time. 8.

Yours, &amp;c., J. G. LAITHWAITE. i^nciosure 1 m JNo. 20. Dear Laithwaite. _ _ Sum merset, Lymington, Hants, 10th August, 1933 . In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are :— r l ncome tax from firms doing business at Aden which at present is collected by the Government of India elsewhere than at Aden, e.g., Calcutta or Bombay .—There19 are many such cases, the most important probably being the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany, which does a very large business at Aden, but whose income tax is paid, not at Aden, but at Calcutta. In the event of separation it (and other firms in the same position) ought to pay in respect of its Aden business to the new Aden Government. 2. Post Office and Telephone receipts and expenditure. —These are now dealt with in India, and we do not know at Aden whether these services are run at a profit or at a loss, I hope the former, in which case the profit should accrue to the new Aden Government. 3. Printing and sale of stamps. —If Aden becomes a Crown Colony it will pre sumably have its own stamps, and the cost of printing them and the proceeds from their sale will be items in the new Aden budget. 4. Mail contract. —The mail steamers between England and India must at present call at Aden under the terms of their contract with the Government of India. If Aden is separated from India an arrangement for its mail service will presumably be made by the Imperial Government. 5. Currency. —In view of the close business connexion between Aden and India it will be convenient if Aden continues to use Indian currency, and an agreement for the supply of currency can, I suppose, be made with the Government of India. 6. Treasury and Finance. —If Aden becomes a Crown Colony it will have its separate financial arrangements and separate budget, and this will probably necessitate the strengthening of its financial staff by the appointment of a Treasurer, who might also control the income tax and Salt and Excise Departments. This is a matter which will require careful consideration by the new administration. I should be strongly opposed to the appointment of any new officials who are not absolutely necessary, and the new organization ought to be carried out as economically as possible. 7. Audit. —Aden accounts are now audited by the Accountant-General, Bombay; and new arrangements for audit will have to be made. This may involve the appoint ment of a local Auditor, or alternatively, the Home Treasury may be able to undertake the audit. Here again the need for economy as well as efficiency ought to be borne in mind. 8. New Laws and Enactments. —In my opinion all existing (Indian) laws and enactments ought to remain in force, and the Indian Civil and Criminal Codes and Procedure ought to be retained. But it will be necessary from time to time to make new laws, enactments, and regulations and to modify old ones. Such changes will probably be infrequent, and I hope that it will not be necessary to appoint a new official for the purpose of drawing them up. But the method and machinery for doing so must be considered. 9. Local Bodies. —These are the Aden Port Trusts (constituted under a Govern ment of Bombay Act of 1888) and the Aden Settlement, which deals with municipal matters under the control of the Chief Commissioner. Each of these bodies has its own revenue and expenditure, and in my opinion they should continue their separate existence as at present, and should not be merged into the new local administration. 10. Lighthouses. —There are four in the territory to be included in the new Colony—two at Aden and two at Perim. The two at Aden are managed by the Aden Port Trust, but the Government of India pay for half the upkeep of one of them. The two at Perim are maintained by the Government of India, to whom lighthouse dues are paid. If Aden is separated 'from India the responsibility and expenditure of the Government of India will presumably be undertaken by the Imperial Government, perhaps with a contribution from the Government of India, as the lights are largely used by ships engaged in Indian trade. It would not be right to make Aden bear these charges unless it receives lighthouse dues sufficient to cover them, and the imposition of dues at Aden ought to be avoided as much as possible, as it tends to drive shipping away to the rival French and Italian ports in the neighbourhood. ‘ 11. Ecclesiastical .—Aden at present forms part of the diocese of Bombay, and is served by chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Establishment. I think this arrange ment ought to be allowed to continue, at any rate for a time. 12. Lunatic Asylum. —There is none at Aden, and lunatics are now sent to India. There are too few of them to justify the establishment of a local asylum, and it would be convenient if the Government of India would permit the existing practice to continue, in return, presumably, for a small agreed payment by the new Aden administration. 13. Rate of Income Tax. —I consider that the Indian rates of income tax ought to be continued, and that they ought to apply to officials employed at Aden as well as to the general public, these officials paying their tax to the Aden administration, and not to the British Treasury.* Enclosure in No. 19. 20 If I had a typewriter with me I should send a copy of this letter to Cowell, as the Colonial Office will be concerned with some of the points I have mentioned as much as, or even more than, the India Office. If you are taking up these questions with the Colonial Office perhaps you will send him a copy. In that case I shall be very grateful if you can send a copy to me also for reference. I expect to be in London for a day or two this month, and for about a fortnight next month, and I return to Aden in October. I can call on you when I am in London if you would like to discuss these matters with me. Yours, &amp;c., B. R. Reilly. Enclosure 2 in No. 20. Dear Reilly, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l, 12th August, 1933. Many thanks for your letter of 10th August and the very valuable list of points for consideration in connexion with the separation of Aden. I have had copies made, one of which I now enclose, and am sending one to Cowell, as you asked me to. I have also given one to Walton. Wh hope to see you at the Middle East Sub-Committee on Tuesday morning to discuss relations with the Imam.

REILLY (Resident, Aden), MR. H. R. COWELL (Colonial Office), AND MR. J. C. WALTON AND MR. J. G. LAITHWAITE (India Office). {The references in the Note below are to the points raised in Colonel Reilly’s demi-official letter of 10th August, 1933.* Colonel Reilly’s demi-official letter of 10th August, 1933, was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Cblonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. Point 1. Income-Tax arrangements in the Event of Separation. —Mr. Cowell said that Crown Colonies as a rule were responsible fon their own income-tax arrange ments and fixed their own rate of income-tax. There would probably be much to be said for fixing (under a special Aden Ordinance, to be made by the new Aden Crown Colony Government) the present Indian rate of income-tax as the rate in future to prevail in Aden. Colonel Reilly emphasized that if and so long as Aden was to continue to draw staff from India the question of income-tax would be one of real importance. So far as budgetting was concerned it would be important to reach an understanding well in advance of actual separation as to whether firms such as the Anglo-Petroleum Oil Company, the shipping companies and the salt interests, which did a large business in Aden, but whose income-tax was at present paid not at Aden but at Calcutta or elsewhere in India, should pay in respect of their Aden business to the new Aden Government. It was agreed that this point should be taken up. 2. Post Office and Telephone Receipts and Expenditure. —It was agreed that the Government of India should be asked to indicate, if possible, to what extent these services were at present run at a profit or at a loss, with a view to the necessary information being available in connexion with the framing of the Aden budget. 3. Printing and Sale of Stamps. —Mr. Cowell agreed that if and when Aden was established as a Crown Colony it would issue its own stamps and that the cost of their printing and the proceeds from their sale would be items in the new Aden budget. 4. Mail Contract. —It was agreed that the India Office should ascertain whether Colonel Reilly’s statement that under the terms of their contract with the Govern ment of India the mail steamers between England and India must at present call at Aden was correct. It was also generally agreed that the simplest course would be to allow existing arrangements, if the Government of India agree, to remain un changed, at any rate for the balance of the period of the Government of India’s present mail contract. 5. Currency. —It was agreed that, at any rate for the time being, much the best arrangement would be that, if no objection was seen by the Government of India, Aden should continue to use Indian currency, arrangements for the supply of the necessary currency being made with the Government of India. Mr. Cowell men tioned that in Mauritius for a very long period Indian currency had remained current, and that precedents were not lacking for action on the lines suggested. G Treasury and Finance. —MM. Cowell indicated that if Aden became a Crown Colony the colonial administration would be responsible for the annual prepara tion and submission of a budget. Colonel Reilly stated that the financial staff was not at the moment very strong and that what he had in minrl was that on the separation of Aden a gazetted officer should be appointed as Treasurer. He should also be in charge of the Income-tax and Salt and Excise Departments. He was opposed to placing any heavier burden on the finances of the new colony than could be avoided, but22 part, at any rate, of the expenses of the official in question might be met by the suppression of existing posts whose duties would in future be performed by him. Thus, it might be possible to abolish the existing Income-tax officer. Mr. Oowell said that he saw no difficulty in providing an official of the necessary status from the Colonial Service. The type of man wanted would probably be a good Assistant Treasurer in a large colony who would in the ordinary course be able to hope for appointment as Treasurer in a large colony. He would inquire of the Personnel Division of the Colonial Office as to the probable rate of pay it would be necessary to offer. Colonel Eeilly emphasized that it was important to select for this post a man of experience and some strength of character, who could assist the Resident in rejecting doubtful demands from units of the Aden administration. 7. Audit. —Mr. Cowell stated that it would be possible, without any difficulty, to place the Aden accounts under the Director of Colonial Audit, who would send over once or twice a year an auditor, perhaps from East Africa. (At present Somaliland and the Seychelles are run jointly for this purpose.) A contribution to his salary would probably have to be made from Aden. It would be unnecessary to appoint a special local auditor, though a local audit clerk would probably be necessary. 8. New Laws and Enactments. —There was general agreement as to the desir ability of retaining in force all existing Indian laws and enactments, including the Indian Civil and Criminal Codes and Procedure. There was also general agreement as to the desirability of some elasticity. While changes would probably be infrequent it was important that it should be possible to make them if and when occasion arose without, e.g., the necessity of passing an Act of Parliament or the like. It was thought that the simplest course would be to provide in the initial Act of Parliament or Order in Council that all laws, &amp;c., already in force in Aden should continue in force until otherwise provided : and to give the Governor power, with the consent of the Crown, to enact laws. The concurrent power of the Crown to 1 legislate by Order in Council would be retained, in accordance with the usual practice in Crown Colonies. Mr. Cowell mentioned that in certain Colonies and Protectorates, e.g.. St. Helena, Gibraltar, and Somaliland, the Governor, who had no’ legislature, made his own laws, the simplest thing would be that if there was no urgency in regard to any law or enactment the Resident should ask the Colonial Office for advice on drafts prepared with the assistance of the Judicial Assistant at Aden. In cases of real urgency or emergency he would have to do the best he could, leaving any errors or loopholes to be remedied later. 9. Local Bodies. —It was agreed that the Aden Port Trust and the Aden Settle ment should continue their separate existence and should not be merged in the new local administration. 10. Lighthouses. —-The Colonial Office undertook to take up the question of the future arrangements in connexion with lighthouses with the Board of Trade. The simplest arrangement would probably be that the Board of Trade should take them over, possibly with a contribution, as suggested by the Resident, from the Govern ment of India. The Resident emphasized that from the point of view of maintaining the attractiveness of Aden as a port, it was most important that the light dues should not at any rate be raised above the level at present charged by the Government of India. The result of any increase might well be to drive traffic to Jibouti or else where . 11. Ecclesiastical. —It was agreed that the possibility of allowing Aden to remain part of the Diocese of Bombay and to be served by Chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Department should be investigated by the India Office, if necessary with the Govern ment of India; and that unless any serious objection proved to exist, this would be the most satisfactory course. 12. Lunatic Asylum. —It was agreed that the best course would be, if the Government of India saw no objection, to permit the existing practice of sending lunatics from Aden to India to continue, possibly for a small agreed payment per head bv the new Aden administration. 13. Rate of Income-tax. —This was covered by the note under head (1) above. The Colonial Office indicated that if and when the salaries of officials at Aden were naid from revenue raised in Aden (including any general grant-in-aid from the Treasury) there would be no question of any application of British income-tax to officials. So long, however, as the Treasury provided anv individual salaries, those salaries would be liable to British income-tax. It would be desirable, therefore, to arrange the estimates initially so that the salaries of the Residents and all other officials were borne on Aden revenues.23 * No. 21. f Enclosure in No. 23. f4. Colonel Reilly, in addition, raised the question of the future of the Government buildings, &amp;c., at Aden. He suggested that the most satisfactory course \vould be that they should be transferred free as they stood to the Imperial Govern ment, on the analogy of the military buildings. 17960/33 [No 46].

This is in reply to your letter of the 14th instant, on the subject of the proposed transfer of Aden to His Majesty’s Government. We agree that it is desirable to scotch the rumour which appears to be current in Aden that the annual contribution of Rs. 20 lakhs (£150,000) of which India would be relieved in the event of separation, would in future be borne by Aden. We have no objection, therefore, to your authorizing the Government of India to issue a state ment to the effect that the annual contribution of Rs. 20 lakhs would in future be borne by Imperial revenues, and that no additional charge on this account would be imposed on the revenues of Aden. As regards the possibility of increased taxation in Aden in future, the Secretary of State has, of course, stated in his announcement in the House of Commons on 19th June, 1933, that His Majesty’s Government would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became in their opinion absolutely necessary.

No. 26. MINUTES REGARDING THE APPOINTMENT OF A TREASURER, In connexion with the contemplated transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office we have discussed with the Resident the question of the appointment of a Treasurer. Under existing circumstances there is no Treasury officer of standing in Aden, since the accounts are kept in India and there are only sub-accountants in Aden. It will be necessary in the future to have a Treasury officer of experience who will be in a position to advise the Resident on financial questions. It is, of course, too early yet to consider details of the appointment, but for the purposes of estimating the cost of administration the Resident would be glad to know, roughly, what salary would be required to obtain an officer from elsewhere in our service for the appointment of Treasurer in Aden. According to the Colonial Office list the annual expenditure of the Settlement is in the neighbourhood of £90,000. H. R. COWELL, 16th May, 1933. The annual expenditure is, roughly, equivalent to that of St. Lucia where, after some argument with the Treasury, the salary of Treasurer has been fixed at £500- £550. But the Windwards must be a much more attractive place to live in than is Aden, and I suppose very much less expensive. Much must depend upon the general conditions of the appointment, but I should say that a salary of not less than £700 would be necessary. The third man in the Cyprus Treasury, the Chief Accountant, FI. C. Ley, is on £400-£600; the third man m Palestine on £550-£750; and the junior Assistant Treasurer on £300-£550 In Somaliland the Treasurer draws £800, and the Assistant Treasurer is on a scale rishm to £700. In Seychelles the Treasurer’s salary.is Rs. 7,450 + Rs. 1,000+Rs 500 fo? quarters. The expenditure of these Dependencies is much larger, but particularly if, as it would seem from the attached particulars, salary is likely to be liable to United Kingdom income-tax, j; I don’t think we could find a man for less than £700 (without quarters). Possible candidates would be :— H. C, Ley, Chief Accountant, Treasury Department, Cyprus* K. C.

Mr. Robinson, I contemplate that the salary will be paid from Aden funds, and will not be liable to United Kingdom income-tax, but only to local income-tax at the rate now current in India. In the circumstances, could we provisionally suggest a salary of £600 to £700? H. R. COWELL, 29th August, 1933. I think so. S. ROBINSON, 29th August, 1933. Colonel Reilly informed. H. R.

In this connexion I see that according to the short summary of Sethna’s speech on 31st August by Times correspondent, he contended that Government of India would lose Es. 10 lakhs in revenue from the salt and other taxes. Can you estimate and let me know what, if any, is the balance of revenue in respect of Aden over the cost of the civil administration? 3. A misleading impression might be caused by Sethna’s reported quotation of Bray’s remark on 29th January, 1929, if this was quoted out of its context and without regard to circumstances in which it was made. Obvious meaning of Bray’s statement was that total transfer, including civil administration, had been abandoned as a solution of old post-war controversy as to future of Aden because this had been settled by His Majesty’s Government’s decision of December, 1926, and transfer of civil administration had thus ceased in 1929 to be in question. Since 1929 the conditions of the problem of course have been entirely changed by the approaching constitutional changes in India. Bray’s promise of prior consultation before transfer would have been meaningless if he had meant that all idea of transfer had been abandoned for ever. 17960/88 [No. 571. No. 29.

Future of Aden was discussed in Council of State on 31st August on resolution that communique of 20th June, be taken into consideration, moved by bar 1 azl-i-Husain, who stated that the official members would not take part in the debate and announced that, if a transfer (? was, omitted) effected, His Majesty’s Govern ment would meet contribution of Es.20 lakhs hitherto borne by India. 2. Amendment was moved by Sir Phiroze Sethna to the effect that Council while no longer objecting to the transfer to Imperial control of political and military administration as at present exists, is definitely of opinion that civil administration should not be transferred to the Colonial Office but should remain with the Govern- ment of India or be retransferred to Bombay. Part 2. , Dealing with the communique, Sethna referred to the interview which the Aga Xhan s deputation had with you recently, and said difficulty of including Aden in future federation is not insurmountable, particularly if administration is retransferred to Bombay; against a saving of 20 lakhs India would lose about 10 lakhs revenue from salt, income-tax and super-tax; assurances regarding racial legislation and segregation valueless, and the position of Indians in Aden would become the same as in Kenya and other colonies. Continuing, he enumerated the following obiections to separation:— o j (1) Sentimental connexion—prosperity due to Indian enterprise. n i 1 l°i nalila i ld P ° rtS WGre P ros P erous P rior to the transfer from Bombay to the Colonial Office after which, higher taxation, due to the more costly administration drove out the Indian traders and killed trade—same would happen ito Aden. (3) Separation will lead to increase in the number of official appointments with consequent rise m taxation. (4) Indian trade with Aden will be lost owing to the inevitable departure of Indian mercnants. rart 3. (5) Eum of salt industry. Proceeding, said Aden Arabs, Jews, and Indians were opposed to separation and concluded by expressing hope that the Government would respect the wishes of the 1 Legislature if against transfer.* No. 28. t No. 30. 27 3. Other speakers, who with one exception opposed separation, traversed the same ground, only additional points being:— (1) Indian merchants developed business in Aden in the belief that it would remain under India. (2) Aden and Bombay opinion opposed separation. (3) His Majesty’s Government should repay India’s expenditure, at least twenty lakhs yearly for the last 95 years. (4) Aden people can voice grievances in the Indian Legislature without difficulty but could not do so easily in England. (5) Aden no&lt; more difficult to merge in the federation than the Andamans. 4. Sethna’s motion was adopted. Record of proceedings will be sent to you soon as possible.

(Copy received in Colonial Office ,14th September, 1933.) [Answered by No. 31.] . Sir, c/o Postmaster, Srinagar, Kashmir, 11th August, 1933. In connexion with the Aden transfer question I remember to have read in a Bombay paper a few months ago, what purports to be the views of the Government of India, from which it would appear that the dual control is intended to be retained even after the civil administration of this territory passes under the control of the Colonial Office. The High Court of Bombay under the Government’s scheme, as reported, will function as a superior court, as at present, to which appeals from Aden would lie, presumably because law and justice will continue to be a responsibility of the Indian Government to be administered through its officers in Aden. In other words there will be Colonial Government without Colonial courts which, if seriously intended to be put into practice, will be, perhaps, without a parallel in any other part of the Empire. 2. It is quite possible that the views of Government have not been properly reported, and as one interested in the future of Aden, I should be much obliged to be told if the transfer is intended to be outright and from which date it is to take effect; whether the machinery of law will be Colonial or Indian, and what is more important, so far as this writer is concerned, whether legal practitioners from India will be allowed to appear before the newly-constituted courts or will be debarred a&amp; in British Somaliland.

WALTON (India Office) to MR. H. R. COWELL (Colonial Office). [Answered by No. 35.] Dear Cowell, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l, 10th October, 1933. I enclose a copy* of the debate in the Indian Council of State on 31st August on the question of the transfer of Aden. We are much disappointed with the result of this debate and the subsequent debate which took place in the Legislative Assembly on 18th September (the report of which will be sent to you in due course). We had hoped that the Government of India, with the announcement of 19th June as their brief, might be able to induce the Legislature at least to take a less one-sided view of the question. But the Government of India—in the debate in the Council of State, at any rate—appear to have adopted a purely laodicean attitude. The results of the debates, though they are not likely to affect the final decision, will make matters a bit more difficult. Our Secretary of State anticipates that the Indian delegates in the Joint Select Committee will raise the question some time during the autumn session of the Committee, and he is anxious to prepare a good case to meet them. We are preparing a brief for him. There are two points in the debate in the Council of State on which you will probably be able to assist us :— (1) On page 103 you will see that Sethna entirely distorted the meaning of assurance (5) in the announcement of 19th June. The meaning of that assurance was, of course, that a proportion of the administrative personnel at Aden would continue to belong to the Indian Service for some years. Sethna appears to have misunderstood it as meaning that only a proportion of the Indians at present serving among the administrative personnel would be retained for some years, and that the remainder would be “ sent away.” You will remember that we had wind of a possible misapprehension of this sort, and discussed the matter with you some time ago. It may be desirable to make it clear that what is meant is this, while the higher political appointments (in which officers of the Indian Political Department, but not Indians, are concerned) would be staffed from the Colonial Service on the expiry of the terms of the present incumbents, there is no intention that transfer should make any difference to the conditions on which Indians are at present serving in other posts, and that the position of such Indians actually holding appointments at Aden will remain as at present. You will remember that the appointment of Muhammad Yasin Khan, the Registrar of the Resident’s Court, was a case in point. (2) On page 114 you will see that Sir Muhammad Akbar Khan (the only member of the Council of State who spoke in favour of the transfer) stated that he supported separation on the clear understanding that Indians . should not be stopped from entering the Aden Protectorate as is the custom now.” In order to make this point clear, could the Secretary of State, if he wishes, say that transfer will make no difference in this respect to the present position (which is, I understand from Reilly, that Indians have the same freedom of movement to and from the Protectorate as other non-Arab inhabitants of the Settlement)?

I regret the * Not reprinted. t No. 34.30 * No. 2. f Enclosure 2 in No. 6. delay in replying to your letter which has been due to the necessity of xefeience to higher authority. As regards the two points in the debate which you mention, I have to reply as follows :— (1) Your announcement of the 19th June did not go as far as we were quite ready to go in regard to the retention of administrative personnel, as you will see on reference to the minutes of the Aden Committee of the 10th ^ February.* We should be prepared to give an assurance thah i n event of the transfer of Aden, all Indian administrative personnel in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on the terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent, and that it was intended that when vacancies occurred, though there would be a gradual substitution of officers of the Colonial Service in the Aden Service, Indians and officers of the Indian Political Depart ment would remain eligible for appointment to such posts. The posts of Resident and Political Secretary would be matters for special considera tion. In giving this assurance we are assuming that the Indian conditions of service contain provisions for the retrenchment of officers or the abolition of offices somewhat similar to the provisions in our service. It would be understood that all newcomers of the Aden Service would be appointed on definite terms, and would have no claim to Indian conditions of service unless these were specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment. (2) We can give an assurance that Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter the Aden Protectorate under precisely the same conditions as any other British subjects. Yours, &amp;c., H. R.

[Answered by No. 39.] Dear Cowell, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l, 28th November, 1933. I ought to have written before to thank you for your letter of the 24th October,* relative to the question of the transfer of Aden. The additional information contained in your letter has been of great assistance to us. 2. The Secretary of State put in a memorandum to the Joint Select Committee representing the views which he himself desired to express to them at this stage, and this, together with a memorandum by Sir P. Sethna, has been printed in the records of the Committee. I enclose a copy of the record.! 3. Copy is also enclosed of telegraphic correspondence with the Government of India. As regards paragraph 4 of the Government of India’s telegram of 17th November, we should be glad to know what you think of Sir B. L. Mitter’s point. Though we take the view here that the Indian fear of racial discrimination is already really answered, as was pointed out in the Secretary of State’s memorandum, by the categorical assurance in the statement of 19th June, it may be that Sir B. Mitter feels that Indians may be apprehensive that the guarantee of no racial legislation may still leave some loophole for discrimination in practice, e.g., in regard to trade. We are aware that there would be no grounds for any such apprehension, but, in order to meet the point, it might be desirable, if you are able to agree, to inform the Government of India that there will be no racial discrimination, either in legislation or in adminis tration.

Copies of debates have only just been placed in hands of members of the Executive Council, some of whom, as is usual during move to Delhi, are on tour. Some delay in formulating our views on debates and on questions set forth in first paragraph of your telegram is thus inevitable. We are however fully alive to urgency and importance of putting before you at the earliest possible moment our considered opinion on future of Aden, which, as debates in both chambers have shown, is matter of considerable material and sentimental importance to India. We shall telegraph our views as soon as possible and trust no decision as to Aden’s future will be taken until you are in possession of them.

Reference our telegram of the 3rd instant, 2400 (sic) Aden. 2. Having regard to the views expressed by all sections of Indian opinion in recent debates in the Assembly and Council of State, we strongly urge that when the future of Aden is considered, strength of genuine Indian sentiment in favour of retaining it as part of British India should be recognised. This sentiment can be met by maintaining broad features of the present arrangements under which the defence of Aden and relations with adjoining protectorate are a responsibility of His Majesty’s Government, while the civil administration alone is concern of the Government of India. We see no serious difficulty in carrying forward these arrangements into the new constitution. Civil administration would, as now, be entrusted to Chief Com missioner as officer subordinate to the federal Government, but subject to convention that the officer appointed by His Majesty’s Government to hold charge of the protec torate and political relations with the interior would automatically be appointed Chief Commissioner by the federal Government. We trust that His Majesty’s Government may see their way to accept the arrangement on these lines, which would leave them free to protect themselves in any way, both as regards the defence of Aden and its use as strategic point. So little is involved in the civil administration of the town of Aden, that it would seem politically most undesirable simply, for the purpose of effecting its transfer from the future federal Government, to embitter Indian feeling in a matter in which practical issues are of such minor importance. We would draw particular attention to this aspect of the case. It may perhaps be necessary at some future date for His Majesty’s Government to assume civil control of Aden, but to do so now would we feel be most unfortunate. We are at present preparing to hand over to India a large measure of control of her own affairs and, in so doing, are demonstrating our trust in her future willingness to maintain the Imperial connexion. If, at the same time, we take from her what small measure of control she still exercises over the one Imrterial link with which she is directly con nected. we shall incur the obvious criticism that our professions of trust are meaningless and that we do not believe either in her power or will to remain within the Empire, such action on our part will, we feel, engender widespread resentment in India and will undoubtedly be a most unfortunate precursor to the introduction of the new constitution. 3. His Excellency the Viceroy, who was absent in Assam when the above opinion was formulated, concurs in these views which represent those of the majority of his Council. 4- Should His Majesty’s Government approve of these proposals, we will con sider in detail the question of including Aden in our proposals for the Chief Com missioner’s provinces in the new Constitution. 'Ur33 Secretary of State for India to Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. Telegram. (Secret.) 30th October. 2658. Your telegram dated 12th October 38. C. Aden. 2. I have given fullest and most sympathetic consideration to your views and have closely studied debates in Legislative Assembly and Council of State. But while I fully appreciate your arguments, and recognise, too, that effect of debates must unfortunately be to crystallise opposition to transfer and afford a grievance, 1 remain of opinion that the only satisfactory solution of the Aden problem is that the Settle ment should be separated from India not later than the date of Federation. Importance must of course attach to expression of opinion by Legislature. But it is common ground between us that its resolutions have no binding force in this matter; and fact that their resolutions were adopted in absence of any guidance from Government or any elaboration of the strong case for a transfer and the substantial safeguards offered by His Majesty’s Government makes it necessary to some extent to discount opinion recorded. 3. To remove any possibility of misunderstanding I think it desirable to elaborate in greater detail than I have hitherto done arguments, which are in my view decisive, in favour of immediate transfer. They are substantially :— (а) Anomaly of including in new constitutional arrangements area already to some extent under Imperial control, inseparable in practice from Aden Protectorate for which India has ceased to be in any way responsible, geographically remote from India and predominantly Arab. Complete divorce between civil administration of Settlement on the one hand and political and military control of Settlement and Pro tectorate on the other would be impracticable. Existing condominium works efficiently only with some difficulty and in practice because in the last resort decision of all questions arising rests in His Majesty’s Government either directly or through Govern ment of India. This would no longer be to the same extent the case under the new constitution. For defence purposes distinction between Protectorate and Settlement will in any event be impossible and it is therefore essential that defence of the latter as well as of former should continue to be direct responsibility of His Majesty’s Government. But if Settlement became part of Indian Federation a continuance of the present system wherebv defence rests in His Majesty’s Government in respect of the Settlement as well as of the Protectorate would be constitutionally anomalous and might give rise to most serious difficulties. Anomaly would be difficult if not impossible to defend effectively against criticism in Legislature and might lead to not illogical demand for retransfer of military control of Protectorate to Government of India. You will appreciate too practical awkwardness of criticism in Legislature of action at Aden of forces in no way under their control, e.g., in quelling riot. (б) If dual control is not abolished now it will be much more difficult to abolish it later once Settlement has become incorporated in Federation. Issue is one which must in my view be faced now or not at all. While I appreciate force of your argument for postponing decision objections seem to me overwhelming. (c) Indian population represents only one-eighth of population of Settlement, though its financial interests are of course very important. As you will have seen from Chief Commissioner’s despatch No. C.403 of 15th July last Arab community while well satisfied with existing system are gravely apprehensive of possibility of Indianisa- tion at Aden, and of subordination of Arab to Indian interests under reforms. More over, effective representation of Arab community in Indian legislature would be extremely difficult nor would it be easy to feel entire confidence, even making all allowance for good will and fairness of legislature, that Indian might not preponderate over Arab interests in case of conflict. It is essential to give great weight in reaching present decision to interests of Arab inhabitants. (d) Strategic position of Aden and its importance from this aspect to Eastern Empire generally and not merely to any single unit is strong argument for control bv Home Government and decisive objection from Parliamentary standpoint to reten tion of existing condominium under new constitution. 4. Assurances already given by His Majesty’s Government in my view cover all reasonable apprehensions, and I am disappointed at failure of legislature to recog nise their generous character and at attempts of various speakers to distort them. In liaht of apprehensions expressed in debate I have now secured however specific additional assurance from Colonial Office that in event of transfer Indian British sub jects would be allowed to enter Protectorate under precisely same conditions as any other British subjects.34 5. Colonial Office are further prepared to give assurance that all Indian administrative personnel serving in Aden at the time of transfer would be retained on terms of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent. When vacancies occurred (though there would be gradual substitution of Colonial Service officers) Indians would remain eligible for appoint ment though on definite terms to be agreed in each case and on basis of Indian con ditions of service only if these were specially imported into their agreements or letters of appointment. 6. On two further points arising out of debate I should like to add (a) that parallel with Somaliland drawn by Sethna was quite misleading. Somaliland ports have gone down because of inability of local administration, owing to unruly character of inhabitants, to levy any direct taxation with the result that administration depends entirely on import duties. Position at Aden is exactly the reverse as Aden is a free port and cost of administration is met by direct taxation. (b) Prominence of Salt question is understandable. But this is essentially a matter for the Indian Legislature, having regard to the Fiscal Convention, In view of solicitude shown in debate for commercial and other interests of Indians at Aden, Legislature may possibly be responsive to any appeal made by Sethna and his friends on behalf of Aden salt manufacturers when question arises. 7. I will endeavour to take an opportunity in immediate future either in the Joint Committee or in discussion with Sethna and his friends to explain reasons for transfer and comprehensive character of assurances, and so to redress balance and emphasise true position. Meanwhile I shall be glad if you will urgently consider matter further, and let me have your observations by telegraph as early as possible. # Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India. (Keceived 6.45 p.m., 17th November, 1933.) Telegram. (Secret.) 17th November. 2731. Your telegram of the 30th ultimo, 2658, Aden. 2. Me have considered most carefully points of view expressed in this telegram. Some of us are not prepared, in spite of your arguments, to resile from attitude already expressed in our telegram of the 12th ultimo, 38 C, which gives local argu ments in favour of the retention of Aden by India. These arguments are admittedly based on sentiment, but, as we have already said, Indian sentiment is likely to prove a most important factor in regulating the relations between the future Government of India and His Majesty’s Government. Those of us who hold this point of view are not prepared to admit that practical difficulties against the retention of Aden settlement by India are so great as to outweigh advantages which would result from its inclusion in the Federation. The difficulties attendant on such a concession to Indian sentiment seem small, while its effect, at a time goodwill of informed Indian opinion in regard to new constitution is of considerable value, would be great. 3. On the other hand, some of us have been considerably impressed by your arguments. In particular, Flis Fxcellency the Commander-in-Chief, who was not present when the question was under consideration in October, desires us to place on record his emphatic agreement with your point of view. In his opinion position at present is entirely anomalous. Aden is of too great importance to the Empire to be placed under divided control. The protectorate and settlement must, from the defence point of view, be solely under the Government of India or under His Majesty’s Government, and he is of opinion that, particularly in view of the transfer already effected of the defence of the protectorate to His Majesty’s Government, the only logical and possible course is to transfer complete control of the settlement as well. 4. Sir B. L. Mitter, who was also not present last month, concurs in the view that divided control is impossible and that, provided Indian interests are fully safe guarded, advantage lies in the transfer of complete control to His Majesty’s Govern ment. He presses, however, for a definite statement by His Majesty’s Government granting full safeguards for Indians against discrimination of any sort vis-a-vis European or other traders in Aden. 5. In these circumstances, it appears to us that decision must finally vest (sic, ? rest) with His Majesty’s Government. We have endeavoured in this, and in our previous telegram, to set before you local point of view. This point of view is entitled to the fullest consideration, but we feel that it is for His Majesty’s Govern-35 * No. 36. f No. 37. ment to decide whether it is sufficient to outweigh the considerations of imperial interests, many of which are beyond our purview. 6. We feel, therefore, that it is unnecessary for us to enter into a detailed consideration of the points raised in your telegram under reference. In regard, however, to salt interests raised in paragraph No. 6 (b), we would point out that we see no reason to suppose that future Indian Legislatures will assume an attitude different from that described in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Finance Department’s letter C.55 Gr.L.33, of the 13th February, 1933. 17960/33 [No. 75].

The expression of views by this Council to the Governor on all matters relating to the town and its people would be of great importance as it would be the only medium for discussion and assist ance between the people and the Governor.

The total receipts and expenditure of the Aden head post office and of the five sub post offices under it during the years 1933-34 and 1934-35 are shown in detail in the accompanying statements. As noted therein the expenditure on staff is based on actual payments made after deducting the emergency cut in pay which was 5/ of pay in the years 1933-34 and 1934-35. No allowance is made for leave and pension charges. As regards the telephone system in Aden, I would request a reference to Clow’s letter Ho.P-228/33 dated the 9th January 1936 to the address of the Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office. The system is working at a profit and it has been proposed to give some relief to the subscribers by reducing the rate of rental for direct connections. The existing contract for the conveyance of mails between England and India by the P. &amp; 0. S. N. Company’s ships is between His Imperial Majesty’s Government and the Company and not between the Government of India and the Company. The contract was executed in 1908 for a period of seven years subject to determination at or after the expiry of that period on giving 24 months* notice. The contract has been allowed to continue in force and as at present arranged is not terminable before the 31st January, 1938. In accordance with the terms of the contract, the mail steamers between England and India must call J.C.Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. at/2 .

We are putting in hand the preparation of a draft Order in Council under section 888 of the Government of India Act, providing for the administration of Aden as a Colony by a Governor and Commander in Chief, with t he necessary subsidiary instruments (Royal Instructions etc.) When the draft is in shape it will be desirable to have a conference with your Legal Adviser, and indeed there are certain provisions of the Order which I think we shall have to ask him to draft - see for example sub-section (3) (c) and (d) of Section 288 of the Act.

I enclose copy of a letter sent to Reilly on 5th November, and of his reply dated 26th November. As regards the last para, of Reilly’s letter, the matters referred to which have to be settled are, I think, administrative arrangements m connection with such subjects as were discussed in a preliminary way at the meeting at the 1.0. on 15th August, 1933, vi^ .. income tax, post office and telephone receipts and expenditure, stamps, A mail contract, | currency, local bodies, lighthouses, ecclesiastical affairs and lunatics. As the provisional date of transfer is 1st April, 1937, it would seem that the personal consultation with Reilly which is desirable would be in time if he came home, as he suggests, about the middle of June 1936. Meanwhile, such further information as is required for the discussion of these matters can be obtained by the 1.0. from the G. of I. and by the G.O., perhaps, from other I Depts. of H.M.G.^such as the Board of .Trade, who may be concerned with particular/particular questions, such as lighthouses^ Apart from administrative questions we have, of coarse, to complete the legislation required for the transfer of Aden by 0. m C. under Section 288 of the G. of I. Act, 1935. This requires co operation between the C.O. and I.Q.; and the G. of I. (and also possibly Reilly) will have to be consulted on the draft 0. in C.; but as the broad lines of the Order are already indicated in the section of the Act, it does not seem that oral consultation with Reilly will be necessary. Consequently, though it will H desirable, as explained below, to draft the Order pretty early in the new year, it does not seem necessary that Reilly should advance the date of his leave on this account, as it would seem to be sufficient to send him the draft, when it is ready, by mail for any observations. The timetable which we have in mind for the 0. in C. is as follows. Under Section 309 of the Act the draft of the Order will require affirmative resolutions by both Houses of Parliament before it can be made. There will be a very large number of orders which will have to be made under the same procedure before Pt. Ill and other parts of the Act can be brought into operation, as is intended, in April 1937. This/about the middle of June it will be m time for discussion of the .administrative details of the change.

I am also grateful to the Colonial Office for their the proposal to appoint me as^first Governor after the transfer, and I hope that this retention of an Indian 4 Service Officer may help to make the transition as smooth as possible and to reassure those among the local people who are apprehensive about the consequences of the change.

On the other hand the arguments against early transfer are very v/eighty and, I think, conclusive. There are a number of administrative questions to be settled in connection with the transfer and their examination has not proceeded very far. Some of these points are set out in Sir B. Reilly’s note at Flag X. The present intention is to discuss them when Sir B. Reilly is in England next summer. ^ The present arrangements for control at Aden may be cumbersome/2 4 - cumbersome, 'but they are known and they seem to work. A hurried transfer of control to the Colonial Office before j all the administrative questiore which arise have been worked out, and carried out at a time when the international situation must be placing a great strain on the Resident at Aden and his officers, might well result in considerable confusion. I have sounded the Colonial Office on this aspect of the question and I think they v/ould deprecate transfer in a hurry. There is a further consideration which is perhaps of less importance. It is that in the event of transfer being more or less simultaneous with the introduction of Provincial Autonomy, it would be less easy for the Indian politicians who were interested to whip up an agitation on the subject. The pill would be &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;.

(a) Chaplains v This is a P.&amp; J. question, which cZ~~ tfc has been discussed -with Reforms Committee. After discussion with Mr. Peel agreed that the simplest course, as it had teen decided in principle that it was unde si rad le to amend the Act so as to give the Government 01 India power to compel Bombay chaplains to serve in /— C m/M-i '] Aden, ana as tne Colonial Office made no provision for the spiritual needs of the inhabitants of their territories, would be to deal with the matter on the basis of one Air Force chaplain, whose administrat^tions would be available to the civil population, any supplementary ^Ministration^ being arranged by the civil population themselves. Ihe P.&amp; J. Department willproweveyy after consultation with the Colonial Office and Air Ministry, dispose of this matter direct with the Government of India. (k) The question of succession at Aden , sir Bernard Reilly’s period as Resident expires in April 1936. He v/ould then, in the ordinary course, go on leave. He falls under the operation of the Indian compulsory retirement rule on attaining the age of 55 in March 1937. The earliest date at which the transfer of Aden is likely to take place is 1st April 1937, the probable date of the introduction of provincial autonomy, and Sir Samuel Hoare recently gave an indication oi this in the House of Commons (the Government //' ) India, who have in the past been disposed to prefer the latest possible date for transfer and possibly something approximating to the date of the introduction of federation, were/2 were not consulted before this undertaking was given. But they have not protested and it iuay he that interest in holding on to Aden is now somewhat waning* On general grounds the sooner the transfer takes place, as it has now been decided in principle that it shall take place, the better). The question affects Sir B. Reilly in two ways; (a) if there was any prospect of transfer taking place earlier than April 1937 and if he is unlikely to be extended after April 1936, he would like to be associated with any preliminary discussions that might take place during the present sumner as to outstanding points in connection with transfer. (b) if, on the other hand, the transfer does not take place before April 1937 and it is decided to •extend him approximately up to that date, he would welcome an opportunity of attending such discussions next year. 2. As regards his own position, he would very much welcome an extension (which would have to be agreed with the Colonial Office) up to March 1937. If the Colonial Office shewed any sign of being prepared to consider him as the first Governor of the new Colony for, say, a year or two after March 1937, he would greatly appreciate it. It would much simplify his arrangements if he could be given any idea before he returns to Aden in September of the probable attitude of Government. 3. The Colonial Office think very highly of Sir B. Reilly and might well be prepared to consider him for the Goveinoiship, at any rate on a short term. So far as we are concerned there would equally be great advantage in having him in office during the transition period. He knows the Aden/a O * I Aden problem in all its aspects and tne process of transfer would be likely to be carried through much more smoothly with a Government of India incumbent than with a Colonial Office incumbent with little or no previous experience of Aden. I suggest in these circumstances that it might be worth sounding sir C. Parkinson informally on the subj ect. point, especially as pressure of work in the Office is so great, in investigating the relatively unimportant details which will have to be disposed of in connection with the transfer so far ahead and they had better be left till next year. If and when they have to be considered the standing Aden Committee, on which Colonial Office, Air Ministry, Treasury, Board of Trade (when necessary) and this Office are represented, will be the simplest machine for handling 4 Whatever the decision, there does not seem much them, u JaJi ti C\) aA tT^ IK 7 ,Air Mail CONI’IDENTIAL.

The Government of India have been considering the future of ^den having regard to the Secretary of State’s declared intention that separation shall take place as soon as possible and in any case before Federation - perhaps at or about the time of the initiation of Provincial Autonomy. Clause 270 of the Bill provides that on a date appointed by His Majesty in Council Aden will cease to be part of British India and arrange ments for regulating the Civil Administration there after will be made by Order in Council. Are we to presume that all the necessary action for bringing about this change in the Administration will be initiated by the India Office or are the Government of India expected to take any action? There would appear to be certain questions of detail which will require to be examined before the change takes place in consultation between the India Office and the Government of India and we presume that the India Office will initiate the correspondence regarding these Questions. Yours sincerely, J.C. Walton n R M ^ Secretary, Whitehall, London, S.W.l.1/ Vn Sir V. Dawson . I attach a brief regarding the retention of the ri^it of appeal from aden to the Bombay High Court. The precedents mentioned in the last paragraph may not carry much weight with Sir J* Wardlaw-Milne # in view of lying from the courts of a British colony or protectorate to the Bombay High Court. I have referred to Sir H. Pearson the question whether there are any precedents in the past of the latter sort. e*g* (as may at one time have been the case) for appeals to the Bombay High Court from the Zanzibar Protectorate or the hast Africa Protectorate. But apart from precedents, the case for the retention of the ri ( ht of appeal from Aden is strong enough* the C.G. (Mr. Cowell) and with Sir B. Reilly was held on l^Tth August, 1933, at which it was generally agreed that arrangements for continuing existing Indian laws in the manner suggested in the second paragraph of the brief would probably be desirable. the fact that they do not include m informal meeting with a representative ofI presume that Clause 272 of the draft G. of 1. Bill, which provides that the British Settlements itet, 1887, shall apply in relation to Aden is quite adequate to provide for the retention of the right of appeal (see Section IV of the Britisa Settlement' Act) and for the continuance of existing laws in force (see Section II of that Act),Retention of right of appeal in judicial cases at Aden to the Bombay High Court. In strongly recommending the separation of Aden from India the Chief Commissioner pointed out that the loss of the ri$it of appeal in judicial cases at Aden to the Bombay High Court would be a practical objection to separation, and he therefore recommended that this right should be preserved. The G. of I. asked whether would agree to this condition, among others, if Aden were separated. The S. of 3. for the Colonies, on being consulted, saw no objection to the retention of this right of appeal which, indeed, he thought would be the most convenient arrangement. The maintenance of this right of appeal has accordingly been publicly announced as one of the conditions which H.I.G. contemplate establishing if the administration of Aden is separated from that of India (S. of S^s reply to Mr. David Grenfell’s question in the H. of C. on 19th June, 1933, and his memo, to the J.S.C., published in its records of 20th November, 1933). The reasons which make it very desirable to separate Aden from India are the important strategic and other Imperial interests which centre at Aden, and the interests of the Arab population. Ail the objects in view will be completely secured by the transfer of the responsibility for the government of Aden from the G. of I. to H.L.G. So long as these objects are secured, it would be undesirable to disturb unnecessarily the existing conditions and arrangements such as the system of law in force and the judicial system. Thus, so far as can be foreseen at present, it will probably be found convenient, in the view not only of the 1.0. but ox the C.O. and of the Chief Commissioner, to provide generally that existing Indian laws, including the Indian Civil and Criminal Codes, and procedure should continue in force (but with power, of course, to repeal and amend them, and to pass new laws) when the transfer takes place.&lt;s This is a practical reason for providing that appeals should continue to lie to the Bombay High Court. There are precedents for the right of appeal to the Bombay High Court, when this is convenient, in cases arising outside India: for example, that Court has already appellate jurisdiction in certain cases arising in Abyssinia and various places in the Persian Gulf^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ' ‘by* ^ ^ 3 I.By Air ^ll .

Colonel Reilly emphasised that if and so long as Aden was to continue to draw staff from India the question of income tax would be one of real importance. So far as budgeting was concerned it would be important to reach an understanding well in advance of actual separation as to whether linns such as the A.P.O.C., the shipping companies and the salt interests, which did a large business in Aden, but whose income tax was at present paid not at Aden but at Calcutta or elsewhere In India, should pc,y in respect of their Aden business to the new Aden Government. It was agreed that this point should he taken up. '* £g.st Off ice, and telephone tph e ipts and expenditure . It was agreed that the Government of India should^ ue asked to indicate if possible to what extent these ' services were at present run at a profit or at a loss, witim2 with a view to the necessary iniomatron being available In connection with the training ot the Aden budget. 3* Printing and sale of stamps . Mr. Cowell agreed that it and when Aden was established as a Crown Colony it would issue its own stamps and that the cost of their printing and the proceeds from their sale would be items in the new Aden budget. 4. Mail contract . It was agreed that the India Office should ascertain whether Colonel Heilly’s statement that under the terms of their contract with the Government of India the mail steamers between England and India must at present call at Aden was correct. It was also generally agreed, that the simplest course would be to allow existing arrangements, if the Government of India agree, to remain unchanged, at any rate for the balance of the period of the Government of India's present mail contract. 5. Currency . It was agreed that, at any rate for the time being, much the best arrangement would be that, if no objection was seen by the Government of India, Aden should continue to use Indian currency, arrangements for the supply of the necessary currency being made with the Government of India. Mr. Cowell mentioned that in Mauritius for a very long period Indian currency had remained current, and that precedents were not lacking for action on the lines suggested. 6* Treasury and finance . Mr* Cowell indicated that if Aden became a Crown Colony the colonial administration would be responsible for the annual preparation and submission of a budget. Colonel/3 Colonel Reilly stated that the financial staff was not at the moment ver y strong and that what he had in mind was that on the separation of Aden a gazetted officer suoula he appointed as Treasurer. He should ai s0 he ir charge of the Income Tax and Salt and Excise Departments. He was opposed to placing any heavier ourden on die finances of the new colony than could Qe avoiaea, hut part at any rate of the expenses of the official in question might be met hy the suppression of existing posts whose duties would in future he performed hy him. 'Thus, it night he possible to abolish the existing Income Tax Officer. lljr ‘ U)ive11 31 f d f^t he saw no difficulty in providing an official of the necessary status from the Colonial oo,rvice. The type of man wanted would probablj oe a good Assistant Treasurer in a large colony who would in the ordinary course be able to hope for appointment as Treasurer in a large colony. He would enquire of me Personnel Division of the Colonial Office as to the probable rate of pay it would he necessary to e-er. colonel Reilly emphasised that It v^s Important to select for this post a man of experience end some strength of character, who could assist tne Resident in rejecting doubtful demands from units of the Aden administration. 7• Audit. ^ C ° We11 Stated that ^ would be possible, without -ny aixficuity, uo place the Aden accounts under the Director ox Colonial Audit, who would send over once or ° WlCe a ' ysar an Editor, perhaps from East Africa. (at present Somaliland and the Seychelles were run jointly for this purpose). A contribution to his salary would probably have to be made from Aden, it would be unnecessary/4 unnecessary to appoint a special local auditor, though a local audit clerk would probably be necessary. 8. New Laws and Enactments . There was general agreement as to the desirability oT retaining in force all existing Indian laws and enactments, including the Indian Civil and Criminal Codes and Procedure. There was also general agreement as to the desirability of some elasticity. While changes would probably be Infrequent it was important that it should be possible to make them if and when occasion arose without, e.g., the necessity of passing an Act of ^ Parliament or the like. It was thought that the simplest course would be to provide in the initial Act of Parliament or Order in Council that all laws etc. already in force in Aden should continue in force until otherwise provided, and to give the Governor power, with the consent oi trie Crown, to enact laws. The concurrent power oi the Crown to legislate by Order in Council would oe retained, in accordance with the usual practice in Crown Colonies. Mr. Cowell mentioned that in certain Colonies and Protectorates, e.g. St. Helena, Gibraltar, ciid Somaliland, the Governor, who had no legislature, made his own laws, subject to disallowance by the Crown (i.s. colonial Office). As regards drafting, the d imp lest thing would oe that if there was no urgency in regard to any law or enactment the Hesident shouldksk _ . . i tne Colonial office for advice on drafts prepared with one assistance of the Judicial Assistant at Aden. In cases of real urgency or emergency he would have to do ohe oest he could, leaving any errors or loopholes to be remedied later. 9• Local bodies. It was agreed that the Aden Port Trust and the Ad orv Settlement/Settlement should continue their separate existence and should not he merged In the new local administration. 10. Lighthouses . The Colonial Office undertook to take up the question of the future arrangements in connection with lighthouses j with the Board of Trade. The simplest arrangement would prohahly he that the Board of Trade should take them over, possibly with a contrihution, as suggested by the Resident, from the Government of India. The Resident emphasised that from the point of view of maintaining the attractiveness of Aden as a port, it was most important that the light dues should not at any rate he raised above the level at present charged by the Government of India. The result of any increase might well be to drive traffic to Jibouti or elsewhere. 11. Ecclesiastical. It was agreed that the possibility of allowing Aden to remain part of the Diocese of Bombay and to be served by Chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Department should be investigated by the India Office,.if necessary with the Government of India; and that unless any serious objection proved to exist, this would he the most satisfactory course. 12. Lunatic Asylum . It v/as agreed that the best course would be, if the Government of India saw no objection, to permit the existing practice of sending lunatics from Men to India to continue, possibly for a small agreed payment per head by the new Men administration. 13. Rate of Income Tax . 'This was covered by the note under head (1) above, ihe Colonial Office indicated that if and when the salarie oi officials at Aden were paid from revenue raised in Aden (including any general grant-in-aid from the Treasury} there/6 tiiere would de no question oi* any application of British income tax to officials. So long, however, as the Treasury provided any individual salaries, those salaries would he liable to British Income Tax. It would he desirable, therefore, to arrange the esthmtes initially so that the salaries of the Resident and all other officials were borne on Aden revenues. 14. Colonel Reilly in addition raised the question of the future of the Government buildings, etc. at Aden. He suggested that the most satisfactory course would be that they should be transferred free as they stood to the Imperial Government, on the analogy of the military buildings.5 ./ f.Z. 4899/33 . lei: Lymington 252 . Summerset, iiymington, HANTS. loth August, 19H3. Dear Laithwaite, in conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that 1 should enumerate some of the points that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Ihose that occur to me are;- Income-tax, from fi rms doing business at Aden which frt present is g_Q l,lected bv the Government of India ^-jeevyhere thap at Adan,, Q-t Ualcutta or Bombay. There are many such cases, the most important probably being the ringlo-Persian Oil Company, which does a very large business at Aden, but whose income-tax is paid, not at Aden, but at Calcutta. In the event of separation it (and other firms in the same position) ought to pay in respect of its Aden business to the new Aden Government. Past Office and Telephone r eceipts and expenditure , these are now dealt with in India, and we do not know at Aden wnether these services are run at a profit or at a loss - I hope the former, in which case the profit should accrue to the new Aden Government. ^and sale of stamps. If Aden becomes a Crown Colony it will presumably have its own stamps, and the cost of printing them and the proceeds from their sale will be items in the new Aden budget # Mail BQQtxaQp.* The mail steamers between England and India must at present call at Aden under the terms of their contract with the Government of India. If Aden is separated from India an arrangement for its mail service will presumably be made by the Imperial Government.5. Currency . In view of the close business connection 7 { between Aden and India it will be convenient if Aden continues to use Indian currency, and an agreement for the supply of currency can, I suppose, be made with the (jovemment of India. 6. treasury and finance . If Aden becomes a Grown Colony it will have its separate financial arrangements and separate budget, and this will probably necessitate the strengthening of its financial staff by the appointment of a treasurer, who might also control the Income-tax and Salt &amp; Excise departments. this is a matter which will require careful consideration by the new administration. I should be strongly opposed to the appointment of any new officials who are not absolutely necessary, and the new organisation ought to be carried out as economically as possible. Audit . Aden accounts are now audited by the Accountant-General, Bombay; and new arrangements for audit will have to be made. 1‘his may involve the appointment of a local Auditor, or alternatively the Home Treasury may be able to undertake the audit. Here again the need for economy as well as efficiency ought to be borne in mind. 8. New. Laws and Enactments . In my opinion all existing (Indian) laws and enactments ought to remain in force, and the Indian Civil and Criminal Codes and Procedure ought to be retained. But it will be necessarv from time to time to make «/ new laws, enactments and regulations and to modify old ones. Such changes will probably be infrequent, and I hope that it will not be necessary to appoint a new official for the purpose of drawing them up. But the method and machinery for doing so must be considered. 9. Local Bodies . These are the Aden Port Trust (constituted under a Government of Bombay Act of 1888) and the Aden Settlement, which deals with municipal matters under the control of the chief Commissioner. Each of these bodies has(3* its own revenue and expenditure, and in my opinion they should continue their separate existence as at present, and should not be merged into the new local administration. 10. Lighthouses . ihere are four in the territory to be included in the new Oolony - two at Aden and two at Perim. The two at Aden are managed by the Aden Port Trust, but the liovernment of India pay for half the upkeep of one of them. The two at Perim are maintained by the U-overnment of India, to whom lighthouse dues are paid. If Aden is separated from India the responsibility and expenditure of the U-ovemment of India will presumably be undertaken by the imperial Government - perhaps with a contribution from the Government of India, as the lights are largely used by ships engaged in Indian trade. It would not be right to make Aden bear these charges unless it receives lighthouse dues sufficient to cover them, and the imposition of dues at Aden ought to be avoided as much as possible, as it tends to drive shipping away to the rival French and Italian ports in the neighbourhood. 11. ecclesiastical . Aden at present forms part of the diocese of Bombay, and is served by chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Establishment. I think this arrangement ought to be allowed to continue, at any rate for a time. 12. Lunatic esylum . There is none at Aden, and lunatics are now sent to India. There are too few of them to justify the establishment of a local asylum, and it would be convenient if the Government of India would permit the existing practice to continue, in return, presumably, for a small agreed payment by the new Aden administration. 13. Late of income-tax . I consider that the Indian rates of income-tax ought to be continued, and that they ought to apply to officials employed at Aden as well as to the general public, these officials paying their tax to the Men administration, and not to the British Treasury. if/If I had a typewriter with me l should send a copy of this letter to Cowell, as the colonial Office will he concerned with some of the points 1 have mentioned as much as, or even more than, the India office. If you are taking up these questions with the C.O. perhaps you will send him a copy. In that case I shall he very grateful if you can send a copy to me also for reference. I expect and for about in October, would like to to he in London for a day or tm this month, a fortnight next month, and 1 return to Aden I can call on you when I am in London if you discuss these matters with me. Yours sincerely, (Sgd). B.R.

Colonel He illy’s d.o. letter of 10th august 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th august. In addition to Colonel Heilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. mint I . Income tax arrange mention the event of separation . Mr. Co'well said that Crown Colonies as a rule were responsible for their own income tax arrangements and fixed their own rate of income tax. There would probably be much to be said for fixing (under a special Aden Ordinance, to be mad el by the new Aden Crown Colony Government} the present Indian rate of income tax as the rate in future to prevail in men. Colonel Heilly emphasised that if ana so long as Aden was to continue to draw staff from India the question of income tax would; be one of real importance. 3o far as. J I budgeting was concerned it would be * important to reacn an understanding well in advance of actual separation as to whether firms such as the A.P.C.C., the shipping companies and the salt interests, which aid a large business in men, but whose income tax was at present paid not at Aden but at Calcutta or elsewhere in India, should pay in respect of their Aden4 5 / 1 tiusiness to the new Aden Governirient. It was agreed that this point should he taken up. 2. Post Office ana telephone receipts ana expenditure . It was agreed that the Government of India.' should he asked to indicate if possible to what extent these services were at present run at a profit or at a loss, with a view to the necessary information being available in connection with the framing of the Aden budget. 3. Printing and sale of stamps . Mr. Go we 11 agreed that if and when Aden was established as a Grown Colony it would issue its own stamps end that the cost of their printing and the proceeds from their sale would be items in the new Aden budget. 4. Mail contract. It was agreed that the India Office should ascertain whether Colonel he illy r s ' statement that under the terms of their contract with the Government of India the mail steamers between Gngland and India must at present call at Aden was correct. It was also generally agreed that the simplest course would be to allow existing arrangements, if the Government of India agree, to remain unchanged, at any rate for the balance pf the period of the Government of India's present mail contract.5. Currency . It was agreed that, at any rate for the time being, much the best arrangement would be that, if no objection was seen by the Government of India, Aden should continue to use Indian currency, arrangements for the supply of the necessary currency being made with the Government of India. Mr. Cowell mentioned that in i^uritius for a very long period Indian currency had remained current, and that precedents were not lacking for action on the lines suggested. 6. Treasury and Finance . Mr. Cowell indicated that if Aden became a Crown Colony the colonial administration would be responsible for the annual preparation and submission of a budget. Colonel Reilly stated that the financial staff was not at the moment very strong and that what he had in mind was that on the separation of Aden a gazetted officer should be appoiited as Treasurer. He should also be in charge of the Income Tax and Salt and excise Departments. He was opposed to placing any heavier burden on the finances of the new colony than could be avoided, but part at any rate of the expenses of the official in question might be met by trie suppression of existing posts whose duties would in future be performed by him. Thus, it might be possible to abolish the existing Income Tax Officer. Mr. Cowell said that he saw no difficulty in providing an official ofthe necessary status from the Colonial f^fi-e-e ♦ The type of man wanted would prohahly he a good Asst.Treasurer in a large colony who would in the ordinary course he able to hope for appointment —7 as Treasurer in a large colony. pay would prohahly he in the the Aden administration. 7. Audit . Mr. Cowell stated that it would he possible, without any difficulty, to place the Aden accounts under trie Director of Colonial Audit, who would send over once or twice a year an auditor, perhaps from East Africa, (at present Somaliland and the Seychelles were run jointly for this purpose). A contribution to his salary would prohahly have to he made from Aden. It would he unnecessary to appoint a special ~ ' u-t-uci-l US . Theresas general agreement as to the desirability of retaining in force all existing ^Indian laws and enactments, includinghfndian Civil and Criminal Cor . and Procedure. There was also general neighbourhood of £500 to £600 a y e &amp; r -J Colonel Reilly emphasised that it was important to select for this post a man of experience and some strength of character, who could assist the year agreeme;10 . Lighthouses . The Colonial Office undertook to take up the question of the future arrangements in connection with lighthouses with the Board of Trade. The simplest arrangement would prohahly he that the Board of Trade should take them over, possibly with a contribution, as suggested by the Resident, from the Government of India. The Resident emphasised that from the point of view of maintaining the attractiveness of Aden as a port, it was most important that the light dues should not at any rate be raised above the level at present charged by the Government of India. The result of any increase might well be to drive traffic to Jibouti or elsewhere. 11. Ecclesiastical . It was agreed that the possibility of allowing Aden to remain part of the Diocese of Bombay and to be served by Chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Department should be investigated by the India Office, if necessary with the Government of India; and that unless any serious objection proved to exist, this would be the most satisfactory course. 12. Lunatic Asylum . It was agreed that the best course would be, if the Government of India// y ^tu J r / ^ 1 v» ^ India saw no objection, to permit the existing practice of sending lunatics from Aden to India to continue, possibly for a small agreed payment per head by the new Aden administration. 13. hate of Income tax. This was covered by the note under head (1) above, ihe Colonial Office indicated that if and when the salaries of officials at Aden were paid from raised in Aden, there would be no question of any application of British income tax to officials*sws*! ^ ' Colonel he illy in addition raised the question of the future of the Government buildings, etc. at Aden. He suggested that the most satisfactory course would be that they should be transferred free as they stood to the Imperial Government, on the analogy of the military buildings.INDIA OFFIC&amp;, WHi r^UALLg 3« 1. -J P•^♦4899/53• lath August 1933.

Those that occur/to me are:~ / 1* business at. Aden which at present ia collaGted by the G overnment of India elsewhere than at ..den , e.g. at Calcutta or Bombay.

These are now dealt with in India, and we do not know at Aden whether these services are run at a profit or at a loss - I hope the former, in which case the profit should accrue to the new Aden Government * 3V Aden becomes a Crown Colony it will presumably have its own stamps, and the cost of printing them and the proceeds from their sale will be items in th© new Aden budget. 4* Mail fiantragt* The mail steamers between England and India must at present call at Aden under the terms of their contract with the Government of India.

If Aden becomes a Crown Colony it will have its separate financial arrangements and separate budget, and this will probably necessitate the strengthening of j, its financial staff by the appointment of a treasurer, who might U&amp;S ' 'h fro i* tv- yA X w ; t XX' K .i. also control the Income-tax and alt t: Excise departments. This is a matter which will require careful consideration by the new administration. I should be strongly opposed to the Vv - appointment of any new officials who are not absolutely^ {pZ Cv| necessary, and the new organisation ought to be carried^’but r 7 ' - . -Ia3 jtT &amp;^J r &lt; r • - ' , v ; ^ .

But it will be necessary from time to time to make new laws, enactments and regulations anti to modify old ones. ^ ,4 * T o f l r tA&amp; uch changes will probably be infrequent, and I hope that it ' \ 'WV- . .,/i ^ , v to appoint a new official for the purpose of drawing them up.

It would not be right to make Aden bear these charges unless it receives lighthouse dues eufficient to cover them, and the imposition of dues at Men ought to be avoided as much as possible, as it tends to drive shipping away to the rival French and Itali an ports in ^ the n eighbourhood. dccles last leal .

Full opportunity will be given for discussion in the Indian Legislative Chambers at their next session and for all the interests concerned to state their views* Meanwhile, His Majesty's Government think that it would be convenient that the considerations which suggest the desirability of a transfer of the administration and the conditions that would be entailed by such a transfer should be made known, so that the problem can be discussed with a full knowledge of the facts* The reasons which suggest that Aden should not remain linked with India under the new constitution are, that it is an area geographically remote from India; that it would not naturally fit into the ne* federation; that it is already to some/some extent under Imperial control, and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which ims already passed wholly out of Indian control. If it ♦V should be decided that the administration of Aden should oe separated from that of India, His Majesty's Government contemplate that the following conditions would be established; (1) India would be relieved of the annual contribution approximately £150,000 sterling, or Rs .20 lakhs, at present payable towards the military and political administration. (2) The right of appeal in judicial cases to the Bombay ^igh Court would be maintained. (3) His Majesty's Government would maintain the existing policy of making Aden a free port unless some radical change in the present economic situation should take place. Prom their own point of view the abandonment of this policy wouid clearly in existing economic conditions be financially unsound, since the prosperity of Aden depends largely on its transit trade 0 ( 4 ) Hls ^jesty's Government would do their utmost to maintain the present standard of administration and would not impose any additional taxation unless such a course became, in their opinion, absolutely necessary. (5) A proportion of Indian service administrative personnel would be retained in Aden service for some years after transfer took place. ( 6 ) Jo racial legislation or segregation would be permitted by His Majesty's Government.
