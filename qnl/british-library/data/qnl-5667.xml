This document is the property of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Confidential. 1899 Baluchistan and Persia. Note by Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick. (Letter from India, No. 189, Secret, 19th October 1899.— Pol. 992/99.) 1. The letteT on which orders are at this moment required refers to the northernmost portion of the ^reat tract, nearJy 850 miles wide, and for the most part desert, which lies between British India and Jvelat proper on the east and Persia on the west, and which extends from the Arabian Sea up to the Southern boundary of the Ameer’s dominions. The whole of that vast tract, with the exception of a small portion adjoining the Afghan border, and (as I understand) Lus Bey la, is included in the dominions of the Khan of Kelat, but his authority over most of it is extremely limited. 2. We are, so far as I can make out, under no obligation to provide a system of administration for any portion of that tract. I see it has been suggested that the circumstance that it has, by arrangements with the Ameer and Persia, been marked off as a British sphere of influence gives rise to some such obligation, and that is an argument which has been often used in similar cases, not only in India but elsewhere; but there is really little foundation for it. It was for the very purpose of preventing any such embarrassing result arising in such cases, on the coasts of Africa, that Sir E. Mnlfit insisted on having the 35th article of the Act of Berlin altered to the shape in which it now stands. With similar foresight Lord Lans- downe’s Government, in making their first proposals to the Secretary of State for a demarcation with the Ameer, took particular care to explain that the demarcation should not be understood to impose on us any such obligation, and the Durand Convention was so drawn as to avoid doing anything of the kind. The demarcation agreements with Persia I have never seen, but unless they are widely different from that with the Ameer, it could hardly be contended that they impose any such obligation on us. It is, no doubt, possible that if those dwelling in one of our demarcated spheres of influence were to persist in raiding across the boundary demar cated, and the other party to the demarcation were to appeal to us to restrain them, we might ultimately be driven to establish some system of control, and that threatened to become the position on the north of the Tochi Valley before I left India ; but, as a rule, unless our officers are fussy, such difficulties do not arise in an acute form in out-of-the-way places, and if they do not we are under no obligation to establish any system of administration or control up to the demarcated border. So much for our responsibilities towards the other parties to the demarcations. Next, as to our obligations to the Khan of Kelat, which also are referred to, the most we have undertaken to do for him, as I understand, is, “ to respect the independence of Kelat and “ to aid the Khan in case of need in the maintenance of a just authority “ and the protection of his territories from external attack by such means as “ the British Government may at the moment deem expedient ” (Vol. 9, Aitchison’s treaties, p. 397), and there is certainly nothing in this to require us to go in, and set up, either in his name or our own, a state of things which has hitherto never existed and which it would never occur to him to set about establishing. As regards any obligations to the people of the country, no doubt the role of apostles of civilization is a tempting one, but it is one which we have no right to take up, at the expense of the Indian taxpayer, in all the wild and out-of-the-way tracts which have fallen on our side of the Durand line. I may add that, as justly observed by the Government of India in a correspondence to which I shall presently have S. 62 . A9 to refer, “ the work of administration cannot be undertaken without an “ extension of responsibility, which is not measured by the expenditure in men and money necessary to keep internal order, but by other and far “ reaching considerations of Imperial policy.” • ^ * 3. The Baluchistan officers, I know, would not agree with this view. They have always displayed an almost passionate desire to bring under their administration every wild tract of country they can get hold of. They first set to work on the southern portion of the great tract above referred to, and pushed their interference to such an extent, that serious disturbances resulted, and Lord Elgin’s Government had to interfere and isssue orders insisting on the country being again placed in the hands of the local chiefs. Whether those orders will stand remains to be seen. It may be that it will be found impossible now to restore the pre-existing state of things, and I suspect some people would be only too glad to find that it was impossible. 4. More recently attention has been directed to the northernmost portion of the tract (the portion with which ive now are immediately concerned), with the result that in 1896 a proposal was submitted for opening a trade route from Nushki to Koh-i- Malik-!3iah in Seistan on the Persian border, and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State in his letter of the 23rd of October 1896. Now if this trade route was to be regarded simply as a means of developing trade, it might well be doubted whether it would be justifiable to invest public money on a scheme so highly speculative. On the chances of this scheme succeeding I do not pretend to pronounce an opinion. The matter is one for consideration by men like Sir C. Bernard, who have made such subjects their study; but I observe that there is a difference of opinion on it among the local officers, and I can AA r ell understand this, for a trade route across Avhat is practically a desert, between termini about 450 miles apart, and with no prospect of any traffic to speak of except the through traffic between these termini does not seem a very hopeful sort of thing. I may add that the form in which the statistics of traffic are submitted are not such as to show how much of the traffic comprised in them really uses the new route for any distance worth speaking of. Thus the statistics for 1898-99 show the A'alue of the trade in round numbers as follows: — Es. Imports - . 3,47,000 Exports ..... 3,81,000 Total - 7,28,000 but these figures include trade passing through Nushki to and from Afghan istan and Kelat Avhich apparently can come along the route only for a distance not worth speaking of. It is impossible to make out from the export tables how much of the exports go to Seistan; but I observe from the import tables that of the Es. 3,47,000 total imports shown only Es. 161,000, or less than half, comes from Seistan. 5. It is candidly admitted in the correspondence that the thing is only an experiment, and it is added in justification of it that we could easily abandon it in the event of its not proving a success; but Ave know, from our experience in the Gomal and Wano, and in the Tochi, and, need I add, on the Chitral road, that it is almost impossible to start a route and protect it without getting mixed up with the affairs of the country it traverses to such an extent as to make it impossible after a little time to come away. 6. The matter, however, does not rest there. If there was any chance of our being able to withdraw in this case, we have cut it away by undertaking to administer the country through which the route passes right up to the borders of Persia. The country west of the Nushki Niabut, which, I under stand, is not subject to the Khan of Kelat, we took possession of on our own authority at the time Ave opened the route; and we have noAV completed the arrangement by taking over in perpetuity from the Khan of Khelat the Nushki Niabut, and, as the Government of India put it, practically annexingZ) 3 that country. This last step, I observe, was advocated by the Agent to the Governor-General, on the ground that one result of it would be “ to give “ us an unbroken belt of administered territory all along the Afghan border “ from Domandi on the Gomal to Koh-i-Malik-Siah ” on the Persian frontier—a thing which, as I have already explained, was scarcely contemplated by those who started the Durand demarcation. We can, of course, if the trade route proves a failure, reduce certain establishments we have sanctioned; hut I do not see how we could retire from the country we have annexed unless indeed we were to do so at once before we are further committed, 7. But there is still something more. The measures to which I have just been referring are really the prelude to more ambitious schemes. It has* for some years been urged that the vast tract lying between us and the Persian border should be opened up by lines of railway, and various schemes have been proposed and surveys and estimates made. The proposal of the late Sir K. Sandeman, who was in correspondence with Lord Curzon on the subject^ was that we should begin by making a railway from the sea, and Sir William Lee-Warner, in his .Memorandum on Mekran written a year ago, held the same view, and proposed a railway starting from the sea and running up to Nushki. Other authorities have given the preference to one or other of several lines from Nushki to the west. It is one of these latter, running from Nushki to Koh-i-Malik-Siah, that at this moment is most in favour, and it has the support of many authorities, from Lord Salisbury down to the energetic young officer now in charge of our new acquisition It is not, of course, proposed to start this project at once. Forward schemes must be developed gradually, and the present moment is not a propitious one for the discussion of them. Lord Curzon’s colleagues have thought it best to reserve the consideration of all such projects for the present, and Lord Curzon himself, who argues at considerable length in favour of this Nushki-Seistan line, tells us that he would he prepared to let it stand over indefinitely in the event of our being able to arrive at a certain under standing with Bussia, of which it is enough here to say that the chance of our being able to arrive at it seems to be of the very smallest. 8. Thus the construction of railways in the country between our frontier and Persia is a matter which is not submitted for our consideration at this moment, but, as it is the second step in a scheme, the first step in which is now being sanctioned, and as all our recent troubles have been due chiefly to our having been led on step by step without seeing whither we were going, I think it well that we should consider what' the result of our constructing such railways would be. That such railways would not within any time to which we can look forward pay anything like their working expenses (to say nothing of interest on capital) is about as clear as anything of the sort could be ; but there is something more serious than that to be considered. If w r e w r ere to leave the vast wilderness lying between us and the Persian frontier in its present state, and if it were possible (which, however, now that we have assumed the administration, is by no means likely) to leave it without troops, there would be no need to trouble ourselves about it in the event of war with Itussia, for there would be nothing in it to tempt an invader. But if we were to construct railways, then we should be compelled even in time of peace to establish militarv stations to protect them, and in the event of -war we should be com pelled to reinforce those military stations up to whatever strength might be necessary to enable them to hold their own against any force that might be brought against them, and this, I may observe, applies with special force to the case of a railway like the proposed Nushki Seistan line, which would run along our border and close to it. We should thus, in the event of war* be out there on the extreme left in a position somewhat similar to that in which we should be in the country from the Malakand to Chitral on the extreme right, and, both our flanks being thus immensely extended, our centre, where all the really important work would have to be done, Avould be correspondingly depleted. 9. It will be observed that I have been treating the scheme up to this as if its only object, or its main object, was the introduction of some system of S. 62. A 24 administration in the wild tract wdiich intervenes between us and Persia, and the development of trade and the construction of railways there; and if this were its main or only object, I should certainly oppose it; hut it is impossible to look at the way in which the whole matter has been treated, from first to last, without seeing that the paramount object aimed at is a widely different one, and one which, it is at least conceivable, might justify all that is proposed. The object to which I refer is that of checking Russia in her advance towards Southern Persia, and primarily to Seistan, and further of obtaining for ourselves, if possible, a position in Seistan, when Persia falls to pieces. 10. Now' this is a matter which I am altogether incompetent to discuss. I am quite unable to judge how far our starting a great trade and estab lishing railway communication between India and Seistan w r ould go towards counteracting Russian influence in Seistan, or whether it is the most effectual mode open to us of counteracting that influence. Again, I am not in a position to form anything like a true estimate of the difference which Russia’s being or not being in Seistan w r ould make to the British Empire generally, or to India in particular. 11. One danger I see that is apprehended from Russia getting hold of Seistan is that she might work downwards from there, and get an outlet on the sea, which is one of her chief objects. What I understand is feared is not that she w’ould creep down through the tract to which I have been referring, for any attempt on her part to do that would of course give rise to a casns belli, but that she would creep down through Persian territory. Now', though there are other routes, and possibly more expeditious routes, by which Russia might attempt to get doAvn to the sea, I can perfectly w r ell understand that it might be expedient to resort even to elaborate and costly measures to close the Seistan route to her. But what I desire particularly and most strongly to insist on is that it is not merely Indian interests, but also and far more Imperial interests that are involved here. I presume I am right in thinking that the danger India w r ould have most to fear in time of trouble from Russian men-of-war in the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Sea would be, not the danger to which she more than any other British possession w r ould be exposed, of attacks upon her coasts, as the danger to which she, in common with the United Kingdom, and a very large proportion of Her Majesty’s dominions abroad, w’ould be exposed, of having her merchant shipping attacked, on the high seas. If that is so, and if elaborate and costly measures should in consequence have to be adopted to prevent Russia getting down to the sea, it seems too obvious for argument that India should not be called upon to bear more than a certain share of the cost of those measures; and further that if Her Majesty’s Government, with whom the decision of such questions must really rest, should determine that those measures could be most effectually taken in a wuld tract which is within the sphere of influence of the Government of India, that circumstance ought not to be allow'ed to make any difference in this respect. To call upon India to pay the whole cost or anything at all like the wdiole cost in such cir cumstances would be almost like asking our South African Colonies to bear the cost of the present w r ar, or even like calling on the ratepayers of Portsmouth to defray the cost of the fortifications there. I think it the more necessary to insist on this point, because it seems to me that people are inclined to forget altogether that the state of things in which the Persian question w r as exclusively or almost exclusively an Indian question has long passed aw T ay. 12. I turn next to another danger which is apprehended from the Russians getting hold of Seistan, namely, that they would thereby acquire an additional position from which to attack Afghanistan; and here no doubt it may with some show r of reason be argued that the interest involved is wholly Indian. I say no more than “ with some show of reason,” because I think it might w'ell be contended on the other side, that seeing wdiat India is to England, and bearing in mind the terribly heavy permanent charges which the Russian danger imposes on India, and the absolutely crushingcharges which India would have to hear in the event of a Hussion invasion in defending herself on the Indian side and in Afghanistan, I say I think, having regard to all this, it might very fairly he argued that the cost of any auxiliary measures to he undertaken from the Persian side, whether in the tract now under consideration or elsewhere, should be borne by Imperial revenues. I will, however, for argument sake, assume that the interest to which I am now referring is to be treated as wholly Indian. But assuming this it is necessary, in order to get some idea of what contribution India ought to make in respect of that interest, that we should consider what the extent of that interest really is. I would put the question thus. Seeing that the Russian railway is already at Kushk, only 80 miles from Herat, and that the materials for an extension to Herat are already there; seeing that things in this respect are already almost as bad for us as they possibly can be, would the presence of Russia in Seistan add so much to our difficulties as to make it worth our while, in order to keep Russia out of Seistan, to occupy the extensive and absolutely worthless country lying between us and the Persian border, to spend there vast sums which would otherwise be available for defensive measures on the Indian side of Afghanistan, and to lock up there in the event of war considerable military forces which could otherwise be employed elsewhere ? This is a question for military experts, and I should like to know what their answer to it would be. 13. There remains the suggestion that if we can keep Russia out of Seistan we may be able to get hold of it ourselves when the break-up comes, and that if we further get possession of the valley of the Helmund we might take the water of that river under control, bring it down to Seistan in canals, and thus restore Seistan to what is said to have been its former position as the granary of that part of the world. Now, the political, military, and engineering questions arising out of that suggestion are altogether beyond my province, but even if they were within it I should think it unnecessary to go into them here. I should think it enough to say that India can take no part in such a scheme. Even if we were to arrive at an understanding with Russia, as Lord Curzon thinks we possibly might be able to do, by which Seistan would fall within [the British sphere of influence, and subsequently England acquired possession of that province, and Her Majesty’s Govern ment were to oiler it to India as a free gift, with a view to her developing its resources for her own profit, I think the offer should be declined. We have quite enough, and far more than enough, on our hands without going out there, and the scheme would be far too speculative a thing for the guardians of the Indian revenues to look at. 14. Now, what is the practical conclusion to which I come ? It is this,— We should not, from a reluctance to raise what are called “contentious questions,” shut our eyes to the fact that what we have now under con sideration is the first step in a momentous new departure—that we should not confine ourselves to the particular Despatch on which orders are now sought, but should look into all the papers available here, and should, before going further, consider the whole scheme as it is sketched out in them, obtaining the opinion of military experts on the military questions involved, and the opinion of financial experts on the financial questions involved ; and that we should endeavour to come to some understanding with the Eoreign Office, not only as to the general nature of the programme to be attempted, but also as to the way in which the cost of all measures which are to be undertaken, whether in the country between Quetta and the Persian border or elsewhere, should be apportioned between Indian revenues on the one hand, and Imperial or other revenues on the other. I think we should insist on a distribution of the cost by fixed shares and not in the way lately suggested by the Government of India, which would throw on Indian revenues the whole of the expenditure to be incurred in, or in connection with, those very parts of Persia in which British influence is to be pushed, and in, or in connection with, which before many years expenditure may have to be incurred to an extent which it is impossible to estimate. If we do not tackle this question now, I fear the result will be6 that we shall he drawn on gradually from one thing to another, and that the view will come more and more to prevail that we are bound to find the money for whatever the Foreign Office may think it necessary to do in connection with the parts of Persia to which I refer. It must be borne in mind in this connection that, as a result of the system under which we work here, the majority of the Council, by which rrtoney grants must be sanctioned, would usually not have access to all the papers connected with matters of this kind, and further that they would on many occasions, as on this present occasion, not be applied to for sanction until after the Government had been irrevocably committed to the expenditure. 15. In conclusion, I desire to explain that nothing is further from my mind than any desire to interfere with the Foreign Office in their manage ment of Persian business. I see plainly that even as things now stand this Council cannot reasonably expect to have much of a voice in Persian affairs, and year by year, as other European nations come to have more and more to do with Persia, those affairs must pass more and more under the exclusive management of the Foreign Office—indeed, as my colleagues may perhaps remember, in a note I wrote some months ago, I urged that the control of all affairs west of Baluchistan and Afghanistan should be vested exclusively in the Foreign Office, who would seek our advice or aid only when they thought fit. All that I insist on is that we should, without further delay, come to some definite understanding as to the incidence of the charges for expenditure. I will only add that, even as things now stand, we are, in my opinion, paying a very much larger share of the expenditure than is fair to the Indian taxpayer. « 22nd November 1899. D. Fitzpatrick.A. 145. This document is the property of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Confidential. 1899 . Baluchistan and Persia. Note by Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick. (Letter from India, No. 189, Secret, 19th October 1899.— Pol. 992/99.) 1. The letter on which orders are at tin’s moment required refers to the northernmost portion of the great tract, nearly 350 miles wide, and for the most part desert, which lies between British India and Kelat proper on the east and Persia on the west, and which extends from the Arabian Sea up to the Southern boundary of the Ameer’s dominions. The whole of that vast tract, with the exception of a small portion adjoining the Afghan border, and (as I understand) Lus Beyla, is included in the dominions of the Khan of Kelat, but his authority over most of it is extremely limited. 2. We are, so far as I can make out, under no obligation to provide a system of administration for any portion of that tract. I see it has been suggested that the circumstance that it has, by arrangements with the Ameer and Persia, been marked off as a British sphere of influence gives rise to some such obligation, and that is an argument which has been often used in similar cases, not only in India but elsewhere; but there is really little foundation for it. It was for the very purpose of preventing any such embarrassing result arising in such cases, on the coasts of Africa, that Sir E. Mulct insisted on having the 35th article of the Act of Berlin altered to the shape in which it now stands. With similar foresight Lord Lans- downe’s Government, in making their first proposals to the Secretary of State for a demarcation with the Ameer, took particular care to explain that the demarcation should not be understood to impose on us any such obligation, and the Durand Convention was so drawn as to avoid doing anything of the kind. The demarcation agreements with Persia I have never seen, but unless they are widely different from that with the Ameer, it could hardly be contended that they impose any such obligation on us. It is, no doubt, possible that if those dwelling in one of our demarcated spheres of influence were to persist in raiding across the boundary demar cated, and the other party to the demarcation were to appeal to us to restrain them, we might ultimately be driven to establish some system of control, and that threatened to become the position on the north of the Tochi Valley before I left India ; but, as a rule, unless our officers are fussy, such difficulties do not arise in an acute form in out-of-the-way places, and if they do not we are under no obligation to establish any system of administration or control up to the demarcated border. So much for our responsibilities towards the other parties to the demarcations. Next, as to our obligations to the Khan of Kelat, which also are referred to, the most we have undertaken to do for him, as I understand, is, “ to respect the independence of Kelat and “ to aid the Khan in case of need in the maintenance of a just authority “ and the protection of his territories from external attack by such means as “ the British Government may at the moment deem expedient ” (Vol. 9, Aitchison’s treaties, p. 397), and there is certainly nothing in this to require us to go in, and set up, either in his name or our own, a state of things which has hitherto never existed and which it would never occur to him to set about establishing. As regards any obligations to the people of the country, no doubt the role of apostles of civilization is a tempting one, but it is one which we have no right to take up, at the expense of the Indian taxpayer, in all the wild and out-of-the-way tracts which have fallen on our side of the Durand line. I may add that, as justly observed by the Government of India in a correspondence to which I shall presently have S. 62. A2 to refer, “ the work of administration cannot be undertaken without an extension of responsibility, which is not measured by the expenditure in “ men and money necessary to keep internal order, but by other and far “ reaching considerations of Imperial policy.” 3. The Baluchistan officers, I know, would not agree with this view. They have always displayed an almost passionate desire to bring under their administration every wild tract of country they can get hold of. They first set to work on the southern portion of the great tract above referred to, and pushed their interference to such an extent, that serious disturbances resulted, and Lord Elgin’s Government had to interfere and isssue orders insisting on the country being again placed in the hands of the local chiefs. Whether those orders will stand remains to be seen. It may be that; it will be found impossible now to restore the pre-existing state of things, and I suspect some people would be only too glad to find that it was impossible. 4. More recently attention has been directed to the northernmost portion of the tract (the portion with which we now are immediately concerned), with the result that in 1896 a proposal was submitted for opening a trade route from Nushki to Koh-i-Malik-Siah in Seistan on the Persian border, and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State in his letter of the 23rd of October 1896. Now if this trade route was to be regarded simply as a means of developing trade, it might w r ell be doubted whether it would be justifiable to invest public money on a scheme so highly speculative. On the chances of this scheme succeeding I do not pretend to pronounce an opinion. The matter is one for consideration by men like Sir C. Bernard, who have made such subjects their study; but I observe that there is a difference of opinion on it among the local officers, and I can well understand this, for a trade route across what is practically a desert, between termini about 450 miles apart, and with no prospect of any traffic to speak of except the through traffic ‘ between these termini does not seem a very hopeful sort of thing. I may add that the form in which the statistics of traffic are submitted are not such as to show how much of the traffic comprised in them really uses the new route for any distance worth speaking of. Thus the statistics for 1898-99 show the value of the trade in round numbers as follows: — Rs. Imports - 3,47,000 Exports - 3,81,000 Total - 7,28,000 but these figures include trade passing through Nushki to and from Afghan istan and Kelat which apparently can come along the route only for a distance not worth speaking of. It is impossible to make out from the export tables how much of the exports go to Seistan; but I observe from the import tables that of the Rs. 3,47,000 total imports shown only Rs. 161,000, or less than half, comes from Seistan. 5. It is candidly admitted in the correspondence that the thing is only an experiment, and it is added in justification of it that we could easily abandon it in the event of its not proving a success; but we know, from our experience in the Gomal and Wano, and in the Tochi, and, need I add, on the Chitral road, that it is almost impossible to start a route and protect it without getting mixed up with the affairs of the country it traverses to such an extent as to make it impossible after a little time to come away. 6. The matter, however, does not rest there. If there was any chance of our being able to withdraw in this case, we have cut it away by undertaking to administer the country through which the route passes right up to the borders of Persia. The country west of the Nushki Niabut, which, I under stand, is not subject to the Khan of Kelat, we took possession of on our own authority at the time we opened the route; and we have now completed the arrangement by taking over in perpetuity from the Khan of Khelat the Nushki Niabut, and, as the Government of India put it, practically annexing3 that country. This last step, I observe, was advocated by the Agent to the Governor-General, on the ground that one result of it would be “ to &lt;n V e tc us an unbroken belt of administered territory all along the Afghan border “ from Domandi on the Gomal to Koh-i-Malik-Siah ” on the Persian frontier—a thing which, as I have already explained, was scarcely contemplated by tnose who started the Durand demarcation. We can, of course, if the trade route proves a failure, reduce certain establishments we have sanctioned; but I do not see how we could retire from the country we have annexed unless indeed we were to do so at once before we are further committed. 7. But there is still something more. The measures to which I have just been referring are really the prelude to more ambitious schemes. It has for some years been urged that the vast tract lying between us and the Persian border should be opened up by lines of railway, and various schemes have been proposed and surveys and estimates made. The proposal of the late Sir B. Sandeman, who was in correspondence with Lord Curzon on the subject, was that we should begin by making a railway from the sea, and Sir \\ illiam Lee-Warner, in his Memorandum on Mekran written a year ago, held the same view, and proposed a railway starting from the sea and running up to Nushki. Other authorities have given the preference to one or other of several lines from Nushki to the west. It is one of these latter running from Nushki to Koh-i-Malik-Siah, that at this moment is most in favour, and it has the support of many authorities, from Lord Salisbury down to the energetic young officer now in charge of our new acquisition. It is not, of course, proposed to start this project at once. Forward schemes must be developed gradually, and the present moment is not a propitious one for the discussion of them. Lord Curzon’s colleagues have thought it best to reserve the consideration of all such projects for the present, and Lord Curzon himself, who argues at considerable length in favour of this Nushki-Seistan line, tells us that he would be prepared to let it stand over indefinitely in the event of our being able to arrive at a certain under standing with Bussia, of which it is enough here to say that the chance of our being aide to arrive at it seems to be of the very smallest. 8. Thus the construction of railways in the country between our frontier and Persia is a matter which is not submitted for our consideration at this moment, but, as it is the second step in a scheme, the first step in which is now being sanctioned, and as all our recent troubles have been due chiefly to our having been led on step by step without seeing whither we were going, I think it well that we should consider what the result of our constructing such railways would be. That such railways would not within any time to which we can look forward pay anything' like their working expenses (to say nothing of interest on capital) is about as clear as anything of the sort could be ; but there is something more serious than that to be considered. If we were to leave the vast wilderness lying between us and the Persian frontier in its present state, and if it Avere possible (which, however, now that we have assumed the administration, is by no means likely) to leave it without troops, there would be no need to trouble ourselves about it in the event of war with Russia, for there would be nothing in it to tempt an invader. But if we were to construct railways, then we should be compelled even in time of peace to establish militmw stations to protect them, and in the event of war we should be com pelled to reinforce those military stations up to whatever strength might be necessary to enable them to hold their OAvn against any force that might be brought against them, and this, I may observe, applies with special force to the case of a railway like the proposed Nushki Seistan line, which would run along our border and close to it. We should thus, in the event of war, be out there on the extreme left in a position somewhat similar to that in which we should be in the country from the Malakand to Chitral on the extreme right, and, both our flanks being thus immensely extended, our centre, where all the really important work would have to' be done, would be correspondingly depleted. 9. It will be observed that I have been treating the scheme up to this as if its only object, or its main object, was the introduction of some system of S. 62. a 24 administration in the wild tract which intervenes between us and Persia, and the development of trade and the construction of railways there; and if this were its main or only object, I should certainly oppose it; but it is impossible to look at the way in which the whole matter has been treated, from first to last, without seeing that the paramount object aimed at is a widely different one, and one which, it is at least conceivable, might justify all that is proposed. The object to which I refer is that of checking itussi'a in her advance towards Southern Persia, and primarily to Seistan, and further of obtaining for ourselves, if possible, a position in Seistan, when Persia falls to pieces. 10. Now this is a matter which I am altogether incompetent to discuss. I am quite unable to judge how far our starting a great trade and estab lishing railway communication between India and Seistan w r ould go towards counteracting Pussian influence in Seistan, or whether it is the most effectual mode open to us of counteracting that influence. Again, I am not in a position to form anything like a true estimate of the difference which Russia’s being or not being in Seistan would make to the British Empire generally, or to India in particular. 11. One danger I see that is apprehended from Russia getting hold of Seistan is that she might work downwards from there, and get an outlet on the sea, wdiich is one of her chief objects. What I understand is feared is not that she would creep down through the tract to which I have been referring, for any attempt on her part to do that would of course give rise to a casvs belli, but that she would creep down through Persian territory. Now, though there are other ixmtes, and possibly more expeditious routes, by which Russia might attempt to get down to the sea, I can perfectly well understand that it might be expedient to resort even to elaborate and costly measures to close the Seistan route to her. But what I desire particularly and most strongly to insist on is that it is not merely Indian interests, but also and far more Imperial interests that are involved here. I presume I am right in thinking that the danger India would have most to fear in time of trouble from Russian men-of-war in the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Sea would be, not the danger to which she more than any other British possession would be exposed, of attacks upon her coasts, as the danger to which she, in common with the United Kingdom, and a very large proportion of Her Majesty’s dominions abroad, would be exposed, of having her merchant shipping attacked, on the high seas. If that is so, and if elaborate and costly measures should in consequence have to be adopted to prevent Russia getting down to the sea, it seems too obvious for argument that India should not be called upon to bear more than a certain share of the cost of those measures ; and further that if Her Majesty’s Government, with whom the decision of such questions must really rest, should determine that those measures could be most effectually taken in a wild tract which is within the sphere of influence of the Government of India, that circumstance ought not to be allowed to make any difference in this respect. To call upon India to pay the whole cost or anything at all like the whole cost in such cir cumstances would be almost like asking our South African Colonies to bear the cost of the present war, or even like calling on the ratepayers of Portsmouth to defray the cost of the fortifications there. I think it the more necessary to insist on this point, because it seems to me that people are inclined to forget altogether that the state of things in which the Persian question was exclusively or almost exclusively an Indian question has Ion' passed away. 12. I turn next to another danger which is apprehended from the Russians getting hold of Seistan, namely, that they would thereby acquire an additional position from which to attack Afghanistan; and here no doubt it may with some show of reason be argued that the interest involved is wholly Indian. I say no more than “ with 'some show of reason,” because I think it might well be contended on the other side, that seeing what India is to England, and bearing in mind the terribly heavy permanent charges which the Russian danger imposes on India, and the absolutely crushingcharges which India would have to hear in the event of a Hussion invasion in defending herself on the Indian side and in Afghanistan, I say I think, having regard to all this, it might very fairly he argued that the cost of any auxiliary measures to he undertaken from the Persian side, whether in the tract now under consideration or elsewhere, should be borne by Imperial revenues. I will, however, for argument sake, assume that the interest to which I am now referring is to be treated as wholly Indian. But assuming this it is necessary, in order to get some idea of what contribution India ought to make in respect of that interest, that we should consider what the extent of that interest really is. I would put the question thus. Seeing that the Russian railway is already at Kushk, only 80 miles from Herat, and that the materials for an extension to Herat are already there; seeing that things in this respect are already almost as bad for us as they possibly can be, would the presence of Russia in Seistan add so much to our difficulties f as to make it worth our while, in order to keep Russia out of Seistan, to occupy the extensive and absolutely worthless country lying between us and the Persian border, to spend there vast sums which would otherwise be available for defensive measures on the Indian side of Afghanistan, and to lock up there in the event of war considerable military forces which could otherwise be employed elsewhere ? This is a question for military experts, and I should like to know what their answer to it would be. 13. There remains the suggestion that if we can keep Russia out of Scistan we may be able to get hold of it ourselves when the break-up comes, and that if we further get possession of the valley of the Helmund we might take the water of that river under control, bring it down to Seistan in canals, and thus restore Seistan to what is said to have been its former position as » the granary of that part of the world. Now, the political, military, and engineering questions arising out of that suggestion are altogether beyond my province, but even if they were within it I should think it unnecessary to go into them here. I should think it enough to say that India can take no part in such a scheme. Even if we were to arrive at an understanding with Russia, as Lord Curzon thinks we possibly might be able to do, by which Seistan would fall within ;the British sphere of influence, and subsequently England acquired possession of that province, and Her Majesty’s Govern ment were to offer it to India as a free gift, with a view to her developing its resources for her own profit, I think the offer should be declined. We have quite enough, and far more than enough, on our hands without going out there, and the scheme would be far too speculative a thing for the guardians of the Indian revenues to look at. &lt; 14. Now, what is the practical conclusion to which I come? It is this,— We should not, from a reluctance to raise what are called “ contentious questions,” shut our eyes to the fact that what we have now under con sideration is the first step in a momentous new departure—that we should not confine ourselves to the particular Despatch on which orders are now sought, but should look into all the papers available here, and should, before going further, consider the whole scheme as it is sketched out in them, obtaining the opinion of military experts on the military questions involved, and the opinion of financial experts on the financial questions involved ; and that we should endeavour to come to some understanding with the Foreign Office, not only as to the general nature of the programme to be attempted, but also as to the way in which the cost of all measures which are to be undertaken, whether in the country between Quetta and the Persian border or elsewhere, should be apportioned between Indian revenues on the one hand, and Imperial or other revenues on the other. I think we should insist on a distribution of the cost by fixed shares and not in the way lately suggested by the Government of India, which would throw on Indian revenues the whole of the expenditure to be incurred in, or in connection with, those very parts of Persia in which British influence is to be pushed, and in, or in connection with, which before many years expenditure may have to be incurred to an extent which it is impossible to estimate. If we do not tackle this question now, I fear the result will be6 that we shall be drawn on gradually from one thing to another, and that the view will come more and more to prevail that we are hound to find the money fgy whatever the Foreign Ofiice may think it necessary to do in connection with the parts of Persia to which I refer. It must be borne in mind in this connection that, as a result of the system under which we work here, the majority of the Council, by which money grants must he sanctioned, would usually not have access to all the papers connected with matters of this kind, and further that they would on many occasions, as on this present occasion, not he applied to for sanction until after the Government had been irrevocably committed to the expenditure. 15. In conclusion, I desire to explain that nothing is further from my mind than any desire to interfere with the Foreign Office in their manage ment of Persian business. I see plainly that even as things now stand this Council cannot reasonably expect to have much of a voice in Persian affairs, and year by year, as other European nations come to have more and more to do with Persia, those affairs must pass more and more under the exclusive management of the Foreign Office—indeed, as my colleagues may perhaps remember, in a note I wrote some months ago, I urged that the control of all affairs west of Baluchistan and Afghanistan should be vested exclusively in the Foreign Office, who would seek our advice or aid only when they thought fit. All that I insist on is that we should, without further delay, come to some definite understanding as to the incidence of the charges for expenditure. I will only add that, even as things now stand, we are, in my opinion, paying a very much larger share of the expenditure than is fair to the Indian taxpayer. D. Fitzpatrick. 22nd November 1899. NA. 145 &gt; This document is the property of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Confidential. 18 J9. Baluchistan and Persia. Note by Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick. (Letter from India, No. 189, Secret, 19th October 1S99.— Pol. 992/99.j 1. The letter on which orders are at this moment required refers to the northernmost portion of the great tract, nearly M50 miles wide, and for the most part desert, which lies between British India and Xelat proper on the east and Persia on the west, and which extends from the Arabian Sea up to the Southern boundary of the Ameer’s dominions. The whole of that vast tract, with the exception of a small portion adjoining the Afghan border, and (as I understand) Lus Beyla, is included in the dominions of the Khan of Kelat, hut his authority over most of it is extremely limited. 2. We are, so far as I can make out, under no obligation to provide a system of administration for any portion of that tract. I see it has been suggested that the circumstance that it has, by arrangements with the Ameer and Persia, been marked off as a British sphere of influence gives rise to some such obligation, and that is an argument which has been often used in similar cases, not only in India but elsewhere; but there is really little foundation for it. It was for the very purpose of preventing any such embarrassing result arising in such cases, on the coasts of Africa, that Sir E. Malet insisted on having the 35th article of the Act of Berlin altered to the shape in which it now stands. W T ith similar foresight Lord Lans- downe’s Government, in making their first proposals to the Secretary of State for a demarcation with the Ameer, took particular care to explain that the demarcation should not be understood to impose on us any such obligation, and the Durand Convention was so drawn as to avoid doing anything of the kind. The demarcation agreements with Persia I have never seen, but unless they are widely different from that with the Ameer, it could hardly be contended that they impose any such obligation on us. It is, no doubt, possible that if those dwelling in one of our demarcated spheres of influence were to persist in raiding across the boundary demar cated, and the other party to the demarcation were to appeal to us to restrain them, we might ultimately be driven to establish some system of control, and that threatened to become the position on the north of the Tochi Valley before I left India ; but, as a rule, unless our officers are fussy, such difficulties do not arise in an acute form in out-of-the-way places, and if they do not we are under no obligation to establish any system of administration or control up to the demarcated border. So much for our responsibilities towards the other parties to the demarcations. Next, as to our obligations to the Khan of Kelat, which also are referred to, the most we have undertaken to do for him, as I understand, is, “ to respect the independence of Kelat and “ to aid the Khan in case of need in the maintenance of a just authority “ and the protection of his territories from external attack by such means as “the British Government may at the moment deem expedient” (Vol. 9, Aitchison’s treaties, p. 397), and there is certainly nothing in this to require us to go in, and set up, either in his name or our own, a state of things which lias hitherto never existed and which it would never occur to him to set about establishing. As regards any obligations to the people of the country, no doubt the role of apostles of civilization is a tempting one* but it is one which we have no right to take up, at the expense of the Indian taxpayer, in all the wild and out-of-the-way tracts which have fallen on our side of the Durand line. I may add that, as justly observed by the Government of India in a correspondence to which I shall presently have S. 62. A2 to refer, “ the work of administration cannot be undertaken without an “ extension of responsibility, which is not measured by the expenditure in men and money necessary to keep internal order, but by other and far “ reaching considerations of Imperial policy.” 3. The Baluchistan officers, I know, would not agree with this view. They have always displayed an almost passionate desire to bring under their administration every wild tract of country they can get hold of. They first set to work on the southern portion of the great tract above referred to, and pushed their interference to such an extent, that serious disturbances resulted, and Lord Elgin’s Government had to interfere and isssue orders insisting on the country being again placed in the hands of the local chiefs. Whether those orders will stand remains to be seen. It may be that it will be found impossible now to restore the pre-existing state of things, and I suspect some people would be only too glad to find that it was impossible. 4. More recently attention has been directed to the northernmost portion of the tract (the portion with which we now are immediately concerned), with the result that in 1896 a proposal was submitted for opening a trade route from Nushki to Koh-i-Malik-Siah in Seistan on the Persian border, and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State in his letter of the 23rd of October 1896. Now if this trade route was to be regarded simply as a means of developing trade, it might well be doubted whether it would be justifiable to invest public money on a scheme so highly speculative. On the chances of this scheme succeeding I do not pretend to pronounce an opinion. The matter is one for consideration by men like Sir C. Bernard, who have made such subjects their study; but I observe that there is a difference of opinion on it among the local officers, and I can well understand this, for a trade route across what is practically a desert, between termini about 450 miles apart, and with no prospect of any traffic to speak of except the through traffic between these termini does not seem a very hopeful sort of thing. I may add that the form in which the statistics of traffic are submitted are not such as to show how much of the traffic comprised in them really uses the new route for any distance worth speaking of. Thus the statistics for 1898-99 show the value of the trade in round numbers as follows: — Bs. Imports - 3,47,000 Exports ----- 3,81,000 Total - 7,28,000 but these figures include trade passing through Nushki to and from Afghan istan and Kelat which apparently can come along the route only for a distance not worth speaking of. It is impossible to make out from the export tables how much of the exports go to Seistan; but I observe from the import tables that of the Its. 3,47,000 total imports shown only 11s. 161,000, or less than half, comes from Seistan. 5. It is candidly admitted in the correspondence that the thing is only an experiment, and it is added in justification of it that we could easily abandon it in the event of its not proving a success; but we know, from our experience in the Gonial and Wano, and in the Tochi, and, need I add, on the Chitral road, that it is almost impossible to start a route and protect it without getting mixed up with the affairs of the country it traverses to such an extent as to make it impossible after a little time to come away. 6. The matter, however, does not rest there. If there was any chance of our being able to withdraw in this case, we have cut it away by undertaking to administer the country through which the route passes right up to the borders of Persia. The country west of the Nushki Niabut, which, I under stand, is not subject to the Khan of Kelat, we took possession of on our own authority at the time we opened the route; and we have now completed the arrangement by taking over in perpetuity from the Khan of Khelat the Nushki Niabut, and, as the Government of India put it, practically annexing3 that country. This last step, I observe, was advocated by the Agent to the Governor-General, on the ground that one result of it would he “ to give “ us an unbroken belt of administered territory all along the Afghan border “ from Domandi on the Gomal to Koh-i-Malik-Siah ” on the Persian frontier—a thing which, as I have already explained, was scarcely contemplated hy those who started the Durand demarcation. We can, of course, if the trade route proves a failure, reduce certain establishments we have sanctioned; hut I do not see how we could retire from the country we have annexed unless indeed we were to do so at once before we are further committed. 7. But there is still something more. The measures to which I have just been referring are really the prelude to more ambitious schemes. It has for some years been urged that the vast tract lying between us and the Persian border should be opened up by lines of railway, and various schemes have been proposed and surveys and estimates made. The proposal of the late Sir K. Sandeman, who w r as in correspondence wdtli Lord Curzon on the subject, was that we should begin by making a railway from the sea, and Sir William Lee-Warner, in his Memorandum on Mekran written a year ago, held the same view, and proposed a railway starting from the sea and running up to Nushki. Other authorities have given the preference to one or other of several lines from Nushki to the west. It is one of these latter, running from Nushki to Koh-i-Malik-Siah, that at this moment is most in favour, and it has the support of many authorities, from Lord Salisbury dow r n to the energetic young officer now' in charge of our new acquisition. It is not, of course, proposed to start this project at once. Forward schemes must be developed gradually, and the present moment is not a propitious one for the discussion of them. Lord Curzon’s colleagues have thought it best to reserve the consideration of all such projects for the present, and Lord Curzon himself, who argues at considerable length in favour of this Nushki-Seistan line, tells us that he would be prepared to let it stand over indefinitely in the event of our being able to arrive at a certain under standing with Bussia, of wdiich it is enough here to say that the chance of our being able to arrive at it seems to be of the very smallest. 8. Thus the construction of railways in the country between our frontier and Persia is a matter which is not submitted for our consideration at this moment, but, as it is the second step in a scheme, the first step in which is now being sanctioned, and as all our recent troubles have been due chiefly to our having been led on step by step without seeing whither we were going, I think it well that we should consider what the result of our constructing such railways would be. That such railways would not within any time to which we can look forward pay anything like their working expenses (to say nothing of interest on capital) is about as clear as anything of the sort could be ; but there is something more serious than that to be considered. If w r e w r ere to leave the vast wilderness lying between us and the Persian frontier in its present state, and if it were possible (which, however, now that w'e have assumed the administration, is by no means likely) to leave it without troops, there would be no need to trouble ourselves about it in the event of w r ar with Bussia, for there would be nothing in it to tempt an invader. But if we were to construct railways, then w r e should be compelled even in time of peace to establish military stations to protect them, and in the event of w T ar w r e should be com pelled to reinforce those military stations up to whatever strength might he necessary to enable them to hold their own against any force that might be brought against them, and this, I may observe, applies with special force to the case of a railway like the proposed Nushki Seistan line, which would run along our border and close to it. We should thus, in the event of war, he out there on the extreme left in a position somewliat similar to that in which we should be in the country from the Malakand to Chitral on the extreme right, and, both our flanks being thus immensely extended, our centre, where all the really important work w ould have to be done, would be correspondingly depleted. 9. It will be observed that I have been treating the scheme up to this as if its only object, or its main object, w r as the introduction of some system of S. 62. A 2administration in the wild tract wdiich intervenes between us and Persia, and the development of trade and the construction of railways there; and if this were its main or only object, I should certainly oppose it; bat it is impossible to look at the way in which the whole matter has been treated, from first to last, without seeing that the paramount object aimed at is a widely different one, and one which, it is at least conceivable, might justify all that is proposed. The object to which I refer is that of checking Xlussia in her advance towards Southern Persia, and primarily to Seistan, and further of obtaining for ourselves, if possible, a position in Seistan, when Persia falls to pieces. 10. Now r this is a matter which I am altogether incompetent to discuss. I am quite unable to judge how far our starting a great trade and estab lishing railway communication between India and Seistan would go towards counteracting Russian influence in Seistan, or whether it is the most effectual mode open to us of counteracting that influence. Again, I am not in a position to form anything like a true estimate of the difference which Russia’s being or not being in Seistan would make to the British Empire generally, or to India in particular. 11. One danger I see that is apprehended from Russia getting hold of Seistan is that she might work downwards from there, and get an outlet on the sea, which is one of her chief objects. What I understand is feared is not that she would creep down through the tract to which I have been referring, for any attempt on her part to do that would of course give rise to a casus belli, but that she would creep down through Persian territory. Now, though there are other routes, and possibly more expeditious routes, by which Russia might attempt to get down to the sea, I can perfectly well understand that it might he expedient to resort even to elaborate and costly measures to close the Seistan route to her. But what I desire particularly and most strongly to insist on is that it is not merely Indian interests, but also and far more Imperial interests that are involved here. I presume I am right in thinking that the danger India would have most to fear in time of trouble from Russian men-of-war in the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Sea would he, not the danger to which she more than any other British possession would be exposed, of attacks upon her coasts, as the danger to which she, in common with the United Kingdom, and a very large proportion of Her Majesty s dominions abroad, would be exposed, of having her merchant shipping attacked, on the high seas. If that is so, and if elaborate and costly measures should in consequence have to be adopted to prevent Russia getting down to the sea, it seems too obvious for argument that India should not be called upon to bear more than a certain share of the cost of those measures; and further that if Her Majesty’s Government, with whom the decision of such questions must really rest, should determine that those measures could be most effectually taken in a wild tract which is within the sphere of influence of the Government of India, that circumstance ought not to be allowed to make any difference in this respect. To call upon India to pay the whole cost or anything at all like the whole cost in such cir cumstances would be almost like asking our South African Colonies to bear the cost of the present war, or even like calling on the ratepayers of Portsmouth to defray the cost of the fortifications there. I think it the more necessary to insist on this point, because it seems to me that people are inclined to forget altogether that the state of things in which the Persian question was exclusively or almost exclusively an Indian question has lono* passed away. 12. I turn next to another danger which is apprehended from the Russians getting hold of Seistan, namely, that they would thereby acquire an additional position from which to attack Afghanistan; and here no doubt it may with some show' of reason be argued that the interest involved is wholly Indian. I say no more than “ with some show of reason,” because I think it might well be contended on the other side, that seeing wdiat India is to England, and bearing in mind the terribly heavy permanent charges which the Russian danger imposes on India, and the absolutely crushingcharges which India would have to hear in the event of a Russian ievasion in defending herself on the Indian side and in Afghanistan, I say I think, having regard to all this, it might very fairly he argued that the cost of any auxiliary measures to he undertaken from the Persian side, whether in the tract now under consideration or elsewhere, should be borne by Imperial revenues. I will, however, for argument sake, assume that the interest to which I am now referring is to be treated as wholly Indian. But assuming this it is necessary, in order to get some idea of what contribution India ought to make in respect of that interest, that we should consider what the extent of that interest really is. I would put the question thus. Seeing that the Russian railway is already at Kushk, only 80 miles from Herat, and that the materials for an extension to Herat are already there; seeing that things in this respect are already almost as bad for us as they possibly can be, would the presence of Russia in Seistan add so much to our difficulties as to make it worth our while, in order to keep Russia out of Seistan, to occupy the extensive and absolutely worthless country lying between us and the Persian border, to spend there vast sums which would otherwise be available for defensive measures on the Indian side of Afghanistan, and to lock up there in the event of war considerable military forces which could otherwise be employed elsewhere ? This is a question for military experts, and I should like to know what their answer to it would be. 13. There remains the suggestion that if we can keep Russia out of Seistan we may he able to get hold of it ourselves when the break-up comes, and that if we further get possession of the valley of the Helmund we might take the water of that river under control, bring it down to Seistan in canals, and thus restore Seistan to what is said to have been its former position as the granary of that part of the world. Now, the political, military, and engineering questions arising out of that suggestion are altogether beyond my province, but even if they were within it I should think it unnecessary to go into them here. I should think it enough to say that India can take no part in such a scheme. Even if we were to arrive at an understanding with Russia, as Lord Curzon thinks we possibly might be able to do, by w r hich Seistan would fall within [the British sphere of influence, and subsequently England acquired possession of that province, and Her Majesty’s Govern ment were to offer it to India as a free gift, with a view to her developing its resources for her own profit, I think the offer should be declined. We have quite enough, and far more than enough, on our hands without going out there, and the scheme would be far too speculative a thing for the guardians of the Indian revenues to look at. 14. Now, what is the practical conclusion to which I come ? It is this,— We should not, from a reluctance to raise what are called “ contentious questions,” shut our eyes to the fact that what we have now under con sideration is the first step in a momentous new departure—that we should not confine ourselves to the particular Despatch on which orders are now sought, but should look into all the papers available here, and should, before going further, consider the whole scheme as it is sketched out in them, obtaining the opinion of military experts on the military questions involved, and the opinion of financial experts on the financial questions involved ; and that we should endeavour to come to some understanding with the Eoreign Office, not only as to the general nature of the programme to be attempted, but also as to the way in which the cost of all measures which are to be undertaken, whether in the country between Quetta and the Persian border or elsewhere, should be apportioned between Indian revenues on the one hand, and Imperial or other revenues on the other. I think we should insist on a distribution of the cost by fixed shares and not in the way lately suggested by the Government of India, which would throw on Indian revenues the whole of the expenditure to be incurred in, or in connection with, those very parts of Persia in which British influence is to he pushed, and in, or in connection with, which before many years expenditure may have to be incurred to an extent which it is impossible to estimate. If we do not tackle this question now, I fear the result will bethat we shall be drawn on gradually from one thing to another, and that the view will come more and more to prevail that we are bound to find the money for whatever the Foreign Office may think it necessary to do in connection with the parts of Persia to which I refer. It must be borne in mind in this connection that, as a result of the system under which we work here, the majority of the Council, by which money grants must be sanctioned, would usually not have access to all the papers connected with matters of this kind, and further that they would on many occasions, as on this present occasion, not be applied to for sanction until after the Government had been irrevocably committed to the expenditure. 15. In conclusion, I desire to explain that nothing is further from my mind than any desire to interfere with the Foreign Office in their manage ment of Persian business. I see plainly that even as things now stand this Council cannot reasonably expect to have much of a voice in Persian affairs, and year by year, as other European nations come to have more and more to do with Persia, those affairs must pass more and more under the exclusive management of the Foreign Office—indeed, as my colleagues may perhaps remember, in a note I wrote some months ago, I urged that the control of all affairs west of Baluchistan and Afghanistan should be vested exclusively in the Foreign Office, who would seek our advice or aid only when they thought fit. All that I insist on is that we should, without further delay, come to some definite understanding as to the incidence of the charges for expenditure. I will only add that, even as things now stand, we are, in my opinion, paying a very much larger share of the expenditure than is fair to the Indian taxpayer. D.

(Letter from India, No. 189, Secret, 19th October 1899.— Pol. 992/99.) 1. The letter on which orders are at this moment required refers to the northernmost portion of the great tract, nearly 850 miles wide, and for the most part desert, which lies between British India and Kelat proper on the east and Persia on the west, and which extends from - the Arabian Sea up to the Southern boundary of the Ameer’s dominions. The whole of that vast tract, with the exception of a small portion adjoining the Afghan border, and (as I understand) Lus Beyla, is included in the dominions of the Khan of Kelat, but his authority over most of it is extremely limited. 2. We are, so far as I make out, under no obligation to provide a system of administration for imy portion of that tract. I see it has been suggested that the circumstance that it has, by arrangements with the Ameer and Persia, been marked off as a British sphere of influence gives rise to some such obligation, and that is an argument which has been often used in similar cases, not only in India but elsewhere; but there is really little foundation for it. It was for the very purpose of preventing any such embarrassing result arising in such cases, on the coasts of Africa, that Sir E. Malet insisted on having the 35th article of the Act of Berlin altered to the shape in which it now stands. With similar foresight Lord Lans- downe’s Government, in making their first proposals to the Secretary of State for a demarcation with the jj^meer, took particular care to explain that the demarcation should not be understood to impose on us any such obligation, and the Durand Convention was so drawn as to avoid doing anything of the kind. The demarcation agreements with Persia I harm never seen, but unless they are widely different from that with the Ameer, it could hardly be contended that they impose any such obligation on us. It is, no doubt, possible that if those dwelling in one of our demarcated spheres of influence were to persist in raiding across the boundary demar cated, and the other party to the demarcation were to appeal to us to restrain them, we might ultimately be driven to establish .some system of control, and that threatened to become the position on the north of the Tochi Valley before I left India ; but, as a rule, unless our officers are fussy, such difficulties do not arise in an acute form in out-of-the-way places, and if they do not avc are under no obligation to establish any system of administration or control up to the demarcated border. So much for our responsibilities towards the other parties to the demarcations. Next, as to our obligations to the Khan of Kelat, which also are referred to, the most avc have undertaken to do for him, as I understand, is, “ to respect the independence of Kelat and “ to aid the Khan in case of need in the maintenance of a just authority “ and the protection of his territories from external attack by such means as “the British Government may at the moment deem expedient” (Vol. 9, Aitchison’s treaties, p. 397), and there is certainly nothing in this to require us to go in, and set up, either in his name or our OAvm, a state of things which lias hitherto ne\ r er existed and A\ r hich it Avould never occur to him to set about establishing. As regards any obligations to the people of the country, no doubt the role of apostles of crdlization is a tempting one, but it is one which Ave have no right to take up, at the expense of the Indian taxpayer, in all the wild and out-of-tke-Avay tracts which ha\'e fallen on our side of the Durand line. I may add that, as justly observed by the Government of India in a correspondence to which I shall presently have S. 62. A‘2 to refer, “ the work of administration cannot be undertaken without an extension of responsibility, which is not measured by the expenditure in “ men and money necessary to keep internal order, but by other and far “ reaching considerations of Imperial policy.” 3. The Baluchistan officers, I know, would not agree with this view. They have always displayed an almost passionate desire to bring under their administration every wild tract of country thdy can get hold of. They first set to work on the southern portion of the great tract above referred to, and pushed their interference to such an extent, that serious disturbances resulted, and Lord Elgin’s Government had to interfere and isssue orders insisting on the country being again placed in the hands of the local chiefs. Whether those orders will stand remains to be seen. It may be that it will be found impossible now to restore the pre-existing state of things, and I suspect some people would he only too glad to find that it was impossible. 4. More recently attention has been directed to the northernmost portion of the tract (the portion with which we now are immediately concerned), with the result that in 1896 a proposal was submitted for opening a trade route from Nushki to Koh-i-Malik-Siah in Seistan on the Persian border, and was sanctioned by the Secretary of State in his letter of the 23rd of October 1896. How if this trade route was to be regarded simply as a means of developing trade, it might well be doubted whether it would be justifiable to invest public money on a scheme so highly speculative. On the chances of this scheme succeeding I do not pretend to pronounce an opinion. The matter is one for consideration by men like Sir C. Bernard, who have made such subjects their study; but I observe that there is a difference of opinion on it among the local officers, and I can well understand this, for a trade route across what is practically a desert, between termini about 450 miles apart, and with no prospect of any traffic to speak of except the through traffic between these termini does not seem a very hopeful sort of thing. I may add that the form in which the statistics of traffic are submitted are not such as to show how much of the traffic comprised in them really uses the new route for any distance worth speaking of. Thus the statistics for 1898-99 show the value of the trade in round numbers as follows: — Its. Imports - 3,47,000 Exports ----- 3,81,000 Total - 7,28,000 but these figures include trade passing through Nushki to and from Afghan istan and Kelat which apparently can come along the route only for a distance not worth speaking of. It is impossible to make out from the export tables how much of the exports go to Seistan; but I observe from the import tables that of the Its. 3,47,000 total imports shown only Rs. 161,000, or less than half, comes from Seistan. 5. It is candidly admitted in the correspondence that the thing is only an experiment, and it is added in justification of it that we could easily abandon it in the event of its not proving a success ; but we know, from our experience in the Gomal and Wano, and in the Tochi, and, need I add, on the Chitral road, that it is almost impossible to start a route and protect it without getting mixed up with the affairs of the country it traverses to such an extent as to make it impossible after a little time to come away. 6. The matter, however, does not rest there. If there was any chance of our being able to withdraw in this case, we have cut it away by undertaking to administer the country through which the route passes right up to the borders of Persia. The country west of the Nushki Niabut, which, I under stand, is not subject to the Khan of Kelat, we took possession of on our own authority at the time we opened the route; and we have now completed the arrangement by taking over in perpetuity from the Khan of Khelat the Nushki Niabut, and, as the Government of India put it, practically annexing3 that country. This last step, I observe, was advocated by the Agent to the Governor-General, on the ground that one result of it would be “ to give “ us an unbroken belt of administered territory all along the Afghan border “ from Domandi on the Gomal to Koh-i-Malik-Siah ” on the Persian frontier—a thing which, as I have already explained, was scarcely contemplated by those who started the Durand demarcation. We can, of course, if the trade route proves a failure, reduce certain establishments we have sanctioned; but I do not see how we could retire from the country we have annexed unless indeed we were to do so at once before we are further committed. 7. But there is still something more. The measures to which I have just been referring are really the prelude to more ambitious schemes. It has for some years been urged that the vast tract lying between us and the Persian border should be opened up by lines of railway, and various schemes have been proposed and surveys and estimates made. The proposal of the late Sir li. Sandeman, who was in correspondence witli Lord Curzon on the subject, was that we should begin by making a railway from the sea, and Sir William Lee-Warner, in his Memorandum on Mekran written a year ago, held the same view, and proposed a railway starting from the sea and running up to Nushki. Other authorities have given the preference to one or other of several lines from Nushki to the west. It is one of these latter, running from Nushki to Koh-i-Malik-Siah, that at this moment is most in favour, and it has the support of many authorities, from Lord Salisbury down to the energetic young officer now in charge of our new acquisition. It is not, of course, proposed to start this project at once. Forward schemes must he developed gradually, and the present moment is not a propitious one for the discussion of them. Lord Curzon’s colleagues have thought it best to reserve the consideration of all such projects for the present, and Lord Curzon himself, who argues at considerable length in favour of this Nushki-Seistan line, tells us that he would be prepared to let it stand over indefinitely in the event of our being able to arrive at a certain under standing with Bussia, of which it is enough here to say that the chance of our being able to arrive at it seems to be of the very smallest. 8. Thus the construction of railways in the country between our frontier and Persia is a matter which is not submitted for our consideration at this moment, but, as it is the second step in a scheme, the first step in which is now being sanctioned, and as all our recent troubles have been due chiefly to our having been led on step by step without seeing whither we were going, I think it well that we should consider what the result of our constructing such railways would be. That such railways would not within any time to which we can look forward pay anything like their working expenses (to say nothing of interest on capital) is about as clear as anything of the sort could be ; but there is something more serious than that to be considered. If we were to leave the vast wilderness lying between us and the Persian frontier in its present state, and if* it were possible (which, however, now that we have assumed the administration, is by no means likely) to leave it without troops, there would be no need to trouble ourselves about it in the event of war with Russia, for there would be nothing in it to tempt an invader. But if we were to construct railways, then we should be compelled even in time of peace to establish military stations to protect them, and in the event of war we should be com pelled to reinforce those military stations up to whatever strength might be necessary to enable them to hold their own against any force that might he brought against them, and this, I may observe, applies with special force to the case of a railway like the proposed Nushki Seistan line, which would run along our border and close to it. We should thus, in the event of war, he out there on the extreme left in a position somewhat similar to that in which we should be in the country from the Malakand to Chitral on the extreme right, and, both our flanks being thus immensely extended, our centre, where all the really important work would have to be done, would be correspondingly depleted. 9. It will be observed that I have been treating the scheme up to this as if its only object, or its main object, was the introduction of some system of S. 62. A 24 administration in the wild tract which intervenes between us and Persia, and the development of trade and the construction of railways there; and if this were its main or only object, I should certainly oppose it; bat it is impossible to look at the way in which the whole matter has been treated, from first to last, without seeing that the paramount object aimed at is a widely different one, and one which, it is at least conceivable, might justify all that is proposed. The object to which I refer is that of checking Russia in her advance towards Southern Persia, and primarily to Seistan, and further of obtaining for ourselves, if possible,'a position in Seistan, when Persia falls to pieces. 10. Now this is a matter which I am altogether incompetent to discuss. I am quite unable to judge how far our starting a great trade and estab lishing railway communication between India and Seistan would go towards counteracting Russian influence in Seistan, or whether it is the most effectual mode open to us of counteracting that influence. Again, I am not in a position to form anything like a true estimate of the difference which Russia’s being or not being in Seistan would make to the British Empire generally, or to India in particular. 11. One danger I see that is apprehended from Russia getting hold of Seistan is that she might work downwards from there, and get an outlet on the sea, which is one of her chief objects. What I understand is feared is not that she would creep down through the tract to which I have been referring, for any attempt on her part to do that would of course give rise to a casus belli, but that she would creep down through Persian territory. Now, though there are other routes, and possibly more expeditious routes, by which Russia might attempt to get down to the sea, I can perfectly well understand that it might be expedient to resort even to elaborate and costly measures to close the Seistan route to her. But what I desire particularly and most strongly to insist on is that it is not merely Indian interests, but also and far more Imperial interests that are involved here. I presume I am right in thinking that the danger India would have most to fear in time of trouble from Russian men-of-war in the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Sea would be, not the danger to which she more than any other British possession would be exposed, of attacks upon her coasts, as the danger to which she, in common with the United Kingdom, and a very large proportion of Her Majesty’s dominions abroad, would be exposed, of having her merchant shipping attacked, on the high seas. If that is so, and if elaborate and costly measures should in consequence have to be adopted to prevent Russia getting down to the sea, it seems too obvious for argument that India should not be called upon to bear more than a certain share of the cost of those measures; and further that if Her Majesty’s Government, with whom the decision of such questions must really rest, should determine that those measures could be most effectually taken in a wild tract which is within the sphere of influence of the Government of India, that circumstance ought not to be allowed to make any difference in this respect. To call upon India to pay the whole cost or anything at all like the whole cost in such cir cumstances would be almost like asking our South African Colonies to bear the cost of the present war, or even like calling on the ratepayers of Portsmouth to defray the cost of the fortifications there. I think it the more necessary to insist on this point, because it seems to me that people are inclined to forget altogether that the state of things in which the Persian question was exclusively or almost exclusively an Indian question has long passed away. 12. I turn next to another danger which is apprehended from the Russians getting hold of Seistan, namely, that they would thereby acquire an additional position from which to attack Afghanistan; and here no doubt it may with some show of reason be argued that the interest involved is wholly Indian. I say no more than “ with some show of reason,” because I ‘think it might well be contended on the other side, that seeing what India is to England, and bearing in mind the terribly heavy permanent charges which the Russian danger imposes on India, and the absolutely crushingo charges which India would have to hear in the event of a Russian invasion in defending herself on the Indian side and in Afghanistan, I say I think, having regard to all this, it might very fairly he argued that the cost of any auxiliary measures to he undertaken from the Persian side, whether in the tract now under consideration or elsewhere, should be borne by Imperial revenues. I will, however, for argument sake, assume that the interest to which I am now referring is to be treated as wholly Indian. But assuming this it is necessary, in order to get some idea of what contribution Endia ought to make in respect of that interest, that we should consider what the extent of that interest really is. I would put the question thus. Seeing that the Russian railway is already at Kushk, only 80 miles from Herat, and that the materials for an extension to Herat are already there; seeing that things in this respect are already almost as bad for us as they possibly can be, would the jnesence of Russia in Seistan add so much to our difficulties as to make it worth our while, in order to keep Russia out of Seistan, to occupy the extensive and absolutely worthless country lying between us and the Persian border, to spend there vast sums which would otherwise be available for defensive measures on the Indian side of Afghanistan, and to lock up there in the event of war considerable military forces which could otherwise be employed elsewhere ? This is a question for military experts, and I should like to know what their answer to it would be. 13. There remains the suggestion that if we can keep Russia out of Seistan we may be able to get hold of it ourselves when the break-up comes, and that if we further get possession of the valley of the Helmund we might take the water of that river under control, bring it down to Seistan in canals, and thus restore Seistan to what is said to have been its former position as the granary of that part of the world. Now, the political, military, and engineering questions arising out of that suggestion are altogether beyond my province, but even if they were within it I should think it unnecessary to go into them here. I should think it enough to say that India can take no part in such a scheme. Even if we were to arrive at an understanding with Russia, as Lord Curzon thinks we possibly might be able to do, by which Seistan would fall within ithe British sphere of influence, and subsequently England acquired possession of that province, and Her Majesty’s Govern ment were to offer it to India as a free gift, with a view to her developing its resources for her own profit, I think the offer should be declined. We have quite enough, and far more than enough, on our hands without going out there, and the scheme would be far too speculative a thing for the guardians of the Indian revenues to look at. 14. Now, what is the practical conclusion to which I come? It is this,— We should not, from a reluctance to raise what are called “ contentious questions,” shut our eyes to the fact that whqit we have now under con sideration is the first step in a momentous new departure—that we should not confine ourselves to the particular Despatch on which orders are now sought, but should look into all the papers available here, and should, before going further, consider the whole scheme as it is sketched out in them, obtaining the opinion of military experts on the military questions involved, and the opinion of financial experts on the financial questions involved ; and that we should endeavour to come to some understanding with the Eoreign Office, not only as to the general nature of the programme to be attempted, but also as to the way in which the cost of all measures which are to be undertaken, whether in the country between Quetta and the Persian border or elsewhere, should be apportioned between Indian revenues on the one hand, and Imperial or other revenues on the other. I think we should insist on a distribution of the cost by fixed shares and not in the way lately suggested by the Government of India, which would throw on Indian revenues the whole of the expenditure to he incurred in, or in connection with, those very parts of Persia in which British influence is to be pushed, and in, or in connection with, which before many years expenditure may have to be incurred to an extent which it is impossible to estimate. If we do not tackle this question now, I fear the result will be6 that we shall be drawn on gradually from one thing to another, and that the view r will come more and more to prevail that we are bound to find the money for whatever the Foreign Office may think it necessary to do in connection with the parts of Persia to which I refer. It must be borne in / mind in this connection that, as a result of the system under which we work here, the majority of the Council, by which money grants must he sanctioned, would usually not have access to all the papers connected with matters of this kind, and further that they would on many occasions, as on this present occasion, not be applied to for sanction until after the Government had been irrevocably committed to the expenditure. 15. In conclusion, I desire to explain that nothing is further from my mind than any desire to interfere with the Foreign Office in their manage ment of Persian business. I see plainly that even as things now stand this Council cannot reasonably expect to have much of a voice in Persian affairs, and year by year, as other European nations come to have more and more to do with Persia, those affairs must pass more and more under the exclusive management of the Foreign Office—indeed, as my colleagues may perhaps remember, in a note I wrote some months ago, I urged that the control of all affairs west of Baluchistan and Afghanistan should be vested exclusively in the Foreign Office, who would seek our advice or aid only when they thought fit. All that I insist on is that we should, without further delay, come to some definite understanding as to the incidence of the charges for expenditure. I will only add that, even as things now stand, we are, in my opinion, paying a very much larger share of the expenditure than is fair to the Indian taxpayer. D.

The note is principally concerned with the costs and benefits of a proposed railway line, which would run from Nushki (recently taken over by the British from the Khan of Kelat) to Koh-i-Malik-Siah [Malek Sīāh Kūh], in Seistan [Sīstān].The file questions the argument that such a railway line would counteract Russian influence in Seistan. Also discussed is the extent to which the Government of India should be expected to finance such a scheme. Fitzpatrick makes the argument that it is wider Imperial interests, rather than those of the Government of India, which are most at stake, and that therefore a distribution of the cost should be made by fixed shares, rather than by relying solely on Indian revenues. He concludes by referring to a note that he wrote some months earlier, in which he advised that the control of all British affairs west of Baluchistan and Afghanistan should be vested exclusively in the Foreign Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Khan of Kalāt, rulers of Kalāt</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Council of India</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Dennis Fitzpatrick</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Durand Line</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Koh-i-Malik-Siah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kelat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Railway lines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade routes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x000302#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
