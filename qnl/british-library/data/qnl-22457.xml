Dear Sir, A short time ago you were kind enough to help this Agency out by letting us have tv»o bicycles for official purposes. I am now writing to ask another favour of you. The Assistant Political Agsnt, Captain Dixon, has a 10 H.P. Vauxhall car whose battery (6 volt) has become completely useless. All efforts to ta procure a 6 volt battery from the bazaar and other sources in Bahrain, having failed, I am now constrained to enquire whether you could kindly assist by supplying one, as I understand you have some 6 volt batteries in stock. It is quite essential for the performance of his duties that Captain Dixon^should be able to use his car, living as he does some two miles from the Wr v ncy. At present he has a battery which has been -Sent him by the State Engineer, but this is liable to be wanted back at any moment. I would therefore be most grateful if you could let me have^ on payment, a 6 volt battery for C a ptain Dixon.
