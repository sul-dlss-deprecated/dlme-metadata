U!J 'fa , A. J. / FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. A Memorandum and an Express Letter from Kabul to the Government of India on the subject of the purchase of Tiger Moth Training Aircraft is submitted. The Afghan Government have intimated that they have decided to postpone consideration of the matter iintaJL the new financial year. They do not intend to train more than six pilots in the near future. The suggestion that the Afghan Government should purchase Tiger Lloth Aircraft, since their system of training pilots on Service Aircraft was wasteful, appears to have come from the British Instructors in the first place. (Quarterly Report on Afghan Air Force Ext.8190/41). 'Hie Counsellor has made out a good case for the supply of the machines should the Afghans decide to purchase and^ if and when/ the Afghans turn to us for help in their problems created by recent events, it may be as well to bear this form of assistance in mind. The Afghans refused the Government of India’s offer to train a certain number of Afghan pilots free in India, althou^i it seems that the Afghan Air Force Commandant favours training ex-Afghanistan. If they change their mind, no doubt the Government of India's offer will still hold good for it may be easier, under present conditions, to train Afghan students in India than to spare Training Aircraft for Afghanistan.

The question of the purchase of Tiger Motn aircraft as training machines was discussed recently by the Military Attache with the Chief of the General Staff and the Afghan Air Force Commandant. 3. The Military Attache reports that a slight difference of opinion was noticeable as between the Chief of the General Staff and the Air Force Commandant. The former was strongly in favour of the suggestion His view was that the very considerable saving in upkeep costs justified the initial cost of the trainer aircraft and that the use of such aircraft lessened the danger of loss of service aircraft used for training purposes. j should if possible be arranged for.out of Afghanistan. If this could be done it was unnecessary to spend money on training aircraft. He admitted, however, that training aircraft would be very useful and would save wear and tear of service machines. * the Air Commandant said that they would put the suggestion to purchas* training aircraft to their Government. They would suggest that a Tiger Moth should be flown to Kabul for test and if satisfactory that funds should be made available for the purchase of four machines. 4. It is considered that if possible and provided that the political situation warrants it, any official request from the Afghan Government on these lines should be sympatiie tic ally considered and that a Tiger Moth should be made available for a test in Kabul. There is a considerable cash saving to the Afghan Government in using these light aircraft for training instead of service aircraft and this is an aspeett of the matter which they would much appreciate. At the same time so long as the Afghan Government do not send their pilots for training to India the possession of these training aircraft will compel them to ( of the machines. Furthermore, these machines do not increase the fighting strength of the Afghan Air Force. The Air Commandant on the other hand was of opinion that training At the end of the discussion both the Chief of the General Staff an retain Britisn instructors and mechanics so as to make the best use W.

M detention of British influence in Afghan Air Force. Reference correspondence ending with Secretary of State for India telegram N p .llGQa.^ dated luth September, 1941. ^T' At a recent interview between Military Attache and Afghan Chief of General Staff and Air Commandant the subject of the retention of the present instruc tors and mechanics was brought up. It was explained to the Air Commandant that the contracts of the two civilian mechanics, Messrs Bradley and Robinson of hawkers and Roils Royce respectively, were due to end in February 1942 while tne tnree Royal Air Force sergeants who had been made available by the Royal Air Force, two as photographic and wireless experts and the third as a fitter, were due to return to India in ITovember 1941. 3. The Aii* Commandant stated that he was in favour of retaining Messrs Bradley and Robinson and the three sergeants and proposed to take up the matter with his Government, he hoped to be able to obtain a decision within the next few weeks. As regards the flying instructor, Flight Lieutenant Newman, his con tract did not expire till June 1942 and the Commandant stated that the question of a renewal of his contract could be considered in the spring. 4. In view of this discussion it may be expected, provided the political situation does not deteriorate, that an official request for the renewal of the contracts of Messrs Bradley and Robinson and for the retention for a further period of the three Royal Air Force sergeants will shortly be received. 5. In this connection the following matters require consideration. M r. R o binson . Messrs Rolls Royce agreed to his staying in Afghanistan till February 1942 on the understanding that they would be relieved of all responsibility for his pay and this was taken over by the Government of India- reference correspondence ending with Foreign Express letter No. F.605-F/4Q., dated the 20th March, 1941. Rolls Royce were also informed that it was not ^reposed to suggest a further extension of Mr. Robinson’s service.— reference / neg ation telegram No. 3 14., dated the 9th February, 1941. Mr. Robinson - him- g&lt;Q^stfrf~Tnight be willing to stay on but would require an assurance from his firm similar to that already given that his prospects would not suffer — reference F.Z.884/41., dated 14th February, 1941 forwarded with India Office end'&amp;rserner.tT W.E. dated the 22nd February, 1941. 6. As a result of the experience of the past year it is considered that the grants made to the three Royal Air Force sergeants for civilian clothing and for fuel (reference enclosure to External Affairs Department Express letter No. F.6Q6-F/40., dated 4th January, 1941) are inadequate. It is understood that tne actual expenditure incurred on civilian ciotning was over Rs.400/- each. As regards fuel, the allotment of Rs.500/- has already been exhausted and the price of wood fuel is rising. It is suggested that an allotment of Hs.700/- should be made for the next year. A demand has also recently been made for the payment of electric light charges. This is being taxen up with the Afghan Government but if they are not prepared to pay the bill it is considered this charge should also be met by the Government of India. 7. If the three sergeants stay on or are succeeded by others it is considered that some small additional grant should be made for furniture. It was found possible to loan a few articles from the Legation stock on the presumption that these would only be required for a year but if the attachment of the sergeants is to be continued some at least of these articles will have to be returned to the Legation. 8. As regards the statement of the Afghan Air Force Commandant that as Flight Lieutenant Newman's contract does not expire till June 1942 the question of its renewal could be taken up next spring, it is considered that it should be made clear to the Afghan Government now that unless they agree to the retention of a British Instructor, whether Flight Lieutenant Newman or another is immaterial, His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to renew 1 any of the contracts.

Moreover, I cannot see how the Axis powers could get aircraft to Afghanistan in present circumstances. The difficulty will therefore be that the Afghans, instead of wishing to get rid of British influence, will probably demand more aircraft and possibly more instructors. Though we are not shown the Air Ministry letter I gather that they have (as usual) said that there are no aircraft to spare in the near future. That being so, I think we should concur in the draft telegram, and should bear in mind the point about aviation spirit made by Mr. Peel. (Sgd. ) I.T.M. Pink. 8. 9. I I agree. (Intld. ) H.A.C. 9. 9.

We have now received the Government of Indian views by telegram and also a letter from the Air Ministry agreeing with the Government of India •'ft earner. Colonel Lancaster in his letter has stressed our favourable position in regard to air force matters in Afghanistan. Our prestige is high on account of the better performance put up by British machines and the more thorough training which Afghan students have had under R.A.F. instructors. The present arrangement^ under which six British instructional staff (including 4 R.A.F. instructors) are now in Kabul, comes to an end next Spring and His Majesty’s Minister and the Government of India both advise,on political grounds,retention of our influence and the immediate preparation of a scheme so that requests for help can be met promptly. The Minister points out that there are as yet no indications that the Afghans intend to continue the Present British connection. With an Allied occupation of PersiaT^^ev®?^ and the natural routes of communication with the Axis powers blocked, Afghanistan may perforce hfive to change her external policy and if she wants help it is to us-that she will no doubt turn. The Afghan Air Force is small but has already shown its/fl5^ in maintaining internal order and in helping to control tribal disturbances on the Afghan border. The Government of India’s three points in drawing up a scheme are (a) Provision of air craft; (b) training facilities in India; (c) retention of our Mission in Afghanistan. As to (a) neither India nor H.M.G. could supr-dy any planes for some time to come. As to (b) the Government of India have training facilities in India but would need instructors and training air craft from H.M.G. The Air Ministry have said that they would be prepared to examine sympathetically a request for strengthening their Missi onymozfi is no doubt would cover extra instructors for the Afghan students in India. As to (c) the Government of India and the Air Ministry agree that there will be no difficulty. t At the moment one cannot foresee the course of developments &gt; and here again, as in the case of assistance in military training, our policy must depend on political developments and any proposals can only be exploratory at present.

From Peel to Caroe through Viceroy's Department. Repeated co Fraser—fytier. 169. Most secret. It is clear that events of next six months in luiddle East may be of critical importance and we have recently been in consultation with Foreign Office on urgent and vital necessity for countering Axis activities in this area. Foreign Office, with a view to thwarting Axis intrigues as far as possible are now urgently investigating steps in Iran to strengthen intelligence and other secret activities largely under guise of commercial intercourse - for example by subsidising British business ventures and by using agents as commercial representatives or advisory experts on German model wherever opportunity occurs. We realise difficulties in pursuing similar P ol icy oi infiltration in Afghanistan but we feel that general lino to take now should be to seize any opportunity offered by Afghan Government for introducing' British subjects into the country and that vie should not allow this policy to be limited by considerations of expense or by rigid restriction of our economic activities to area East of Kabul-Kandahar line. We should be grateful if you could consult with D.I.B. and let us have an early expression of your views and any suggestions for acuion on above lines, he are glad to see from your telegram No. ^613 of 3rd June, which wo have taken up .rith the Foreign Office, that Government of India are already thinking along somewhat similar linos. r D.I.B. will no doubt have shown you information from secret sources regarding Axis intrigues with Bose and Faqir of Ipi. Foreign Office are most anxious to be assured that everything possible is being done to deal with situation. In light of above we should be grateful for further information and comments of Government of India in regard to two following cases: (a) Road engineer for Afghan Government (reference Government of India's Express Letter No.F.141-F/41 of 24th March to Kabul). How does this particular matter stand? On ‘information available at uhis end it seems to us that Government of India might well have o-dopted Fraser-Tytier's suggestion that they should find part of pay of Forestry expert and road engineer in order not to lose opportunity offered of introducing British experts into Afghanistan. (b) Helmand. Bridge and bridges on Horat-Kandahar road (correspondence ending with Katodon 153 of 16th May). We have not seen full correspondence between Government of India and Kabul regarding Helmand Bridge but it seems that British tender was 'much too high to bo accepted' (see Fraser-Tytler's d.o. letter of .-2nd March to you). In order to prevent this most important contract from going to Germans, did Government of India consider 'whether it might not have been 'worth while to subsidise Gammon out of Afghan Fund? As regards other bridges, we recognise importance of strategic considerations, subject to your views on Prime Minister's remark reported in last sentence of Katodon 153. On the otner hand Fraser—Tytier reckons that bridges could not possibly be finished before winter of 1942-1943 at earliest and in present emergency wc doubt whether there is much to bo gainedby taking too long a view of future developments. As it is desirable during critical months ah^ead to interfere vith Gorman plans in evory possible way, would there not be much to be said for using the pretext of assisting with these bridges to secure a footing for ourselves and to oust German influence from this important area? It would no doubt be possible without much difficulty to spin out time before and during construction on one excuse or another and local Afghans could bo kept sweet by judicious expenditure in right quarters. We should bo glad if you would consider matter again from this point of view and let us have your views..■&gt;EX No.29. avti^LiOPY Kabul. irV %ir Sir, VXZt Utr, 1941. 3750 1941 I have the honour to forward ^ herewith a copy of a despatch, as marked below, vfctich I have addressed to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

There are now indications that some eighty students from schools in ?abul are being selected for training in aviation, and squadron-Leader C.B.S.Burt-Andrews considers that as the initial training given by an 1taiian ixxs true tor in i.abul to a previous batch of students i.as a complete failure, the Afghan Government must choose between cai'ryiii^ out future training in i abul entirely on the Bi*itish *.A.F. syste i which has proved satisfactory, or once more give the stuaeuta a very inferior initial training under Italian super- have to consider which countries may be our possible co«i»petitox*s in aviation subjects in this country and come to a decision wnether we should sacrifice the interest and influence »e already have, or embark on attempts to maintain the position we have gained in this sphere and if possible ixxcrease it.

I would urge that similar action be taken in regard to the training of furthery - 7 - Air Force personnel in India, and the retention of our exietin^ instructional euiff (including Uie three R. ,.f\ sergeant instructors) no^ in Kabul. I eug^est that the whole position be reviewed and a uexinite decision reached referring our luture policy as it ai’tecte the .Ighan Air rorce. The review eaould take into account the following.' consiceratiorus:• (a; should the . k f*,han (iovernuent ask for the supply of wore British uircrait, i^re we prepared to ;a*et u.eir require- „ientav 11 is possible that w« oay not be jbie to do so for six to twelve months.

If they do, should we sac- rii*ce our present advantages uno alu.ow tiieu to urn to Italy huaeia or uenasny for assistance. (b) Altn ugh the Afghan Government at the «nc of 1940 turned down our ofi.er to train seventy students in aviation in India it is possible that later this year they may again ask for these facilities. hould they do so, I am strongly of ^.he opinion Uiat Uieir request aaould be mst. he training of these additional students will assist In pAacin^ tne vfghan Air Jorce on a sounder oasis, result in an increase in Urn number of officers ana ;aen with a pro-British bias in the Air Force, ana proviae a method of maintaining and possibly increasing our influence. Aii® grant oi such facilities, provides quicker and * .ore beneficial resultc Uian the actual sale of aircraft.- 8 - ^noulc we not lor various reasons be in a position to train Afghan personal in India 9 then we nave to lace the fact that the Afghan Government will turn to Italy, Russia or Germany for assistance. T am convinced that had we been able to despatch the seventy students to India within a or two of Uie request being made, the offer to train uieu woulvi not have oeen refused at a later stage. he ueiay in uieir despatch gave our co^ipetitors an opportiinity of maxi^ rtipresenta tions to the .fgnun Government wiiicn in this case jroved effective. I suggest that in future all details be arrange so Uiat Uxe r .A.F. or other training ^s^biisxwaent can accept the students at snort notice, the students be sent to India i* s iiiit;diately, ^nd for the first two or Uiree months oe taught i,relish axKi urn uneory of aviation etc., aiia l-ter commence Ui6 nore tccnnical siue of their trnining. Vhis procedure would avoid a premature leakage of information in Kabul, and once the students reach India, representations by our competitors would be of little avail. (c) It was difficult in the first instance to secure the consent of the nfgnan Government for the attachment of three K.A.F. uergeants for one year to the *fghan Air Force, 'rheas F.C.Q.e arrived in Decer i oer,1940 ana curing Uie period they have been in Kabul have siiown the Afghan Air Force how useful they can oe to them, ^particularly in organising a photographic and /T section. hquacron Leader Burt-.ndrews considers tha; the retention of Uiese three instructors for a further year vould be in our interests *s well as those of tne &gt;fghans. r^very Knglishman employed in Uiia country means one less foreigner, and the advantage of this to us from an oral propaganda point of view ic very ouvioue.
