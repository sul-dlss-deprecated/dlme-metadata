The principal reason is the lack of Interest amongst the operators of jewellery stores in proooting the sale of natural pearls, their reluctance in learning to distinguish between natural and cultural pearl b, and in falling to pass any information on to the consuming public. The average dealer in thv i. does not appreciate the beauty or quality of a fine natural pearl, and usually prefers to sell cultured pearls or even simulated pearls. Secondly, the present luxury tax on jewellery items together with the high rate of taxation on the income of the middle and upper bracket groups combine to prevent any great increase in the sale of natural pearls as it is amongst the middle and uppar class bracket income groups that the greatest market for pearls exist. ThlrdXfar, the reluctance of the dealers to advertise extensively the natural pearl. Tha great maount of publicity given to the cultured pearl has tended to discourage dealers in natural pearls from advertising. Fourthly the uncertainty of the supply of natural pearls at the present time. There is some doubt whether pearls will be available since the Import control announced by the Government of India. There is also considerable concern as to whether arrangements can be made for drilling the pearls. It is understood that some drillers have been transferred from Bombay tb the Bahrein Islands in an attempt to establish the pearl drilling industry amongst tha fishermen in the Islands, but it is not known how successful this will turn out to be. Drilling has been attempted in the D.S. Juergens and Andersen Company at one time brought in a considerable Quantity of pearls to be drilled in this country. The result was quite unsuccessful. The pearls were either broken or so badly burned In drilling that they were unsuitable for jewellery uses. Drilling of pearls must be done slwwly and the high labour cost and fast production methods of the tnlted States males It an entirely unsuitable industry for this country. 7th January, 1948 F.I&amp;.

Jj.il M !r• Bloch makes a good impression and seeias to he ready to take an active part in helping to re-establish the Persian Gulf Trade. barren of Julius Raunheia &amp; Company stated the prohibition of imported pearls into India will create a i-lacK roax’ket in Bombay and merchants will evade taxes also; pearls will be smuggled into Bombay via Portugese India. He stated further, the efforts of their Indian representative o. Pack, to operate in the Persian Gulf were not very success ful. Nevertheless, his firm has done more business in natural pearls lastaonth than any previous month in the history of their 25 years as a company dealing principally in pearls. Their purchases amounted approximately to |250,000 during 19*7 and they are regarded by the trad 3 as the largest dealers in the United States. The tivo prominent New York Jewellers, Cartier and Tiffany, purchase their pearl requirements from Raunhelm's whenever they are unable to import their needs from their Paris offices, even then, they often purchase from Raunhein^s representative, -ir• arren appears to be fully informed regarding the conditions prevailing on the Persian Gulf and in India, and seems to be quite content to rely on his Bombay representative to continue to send him the merchandise he requires. Hr. Gory of Cartier and Mr. Moore of Tiffany stated their firms only sell the natural pearl and will continue to do e verything they can to uphold the real pearl and discourage the imitation. Mr. Simon Lieberzoan of Jacques Bienenfeld Pearls Inc., has given considerable thought to the problem. In thr first place he expressed a desire to be an exclusive agent for the Persian Gulf authorities. When he was informed that the inquiry could not be confined to one individual he stated the natural pari industry was dying a natural death as the Persian Gulf fisheries could not opr ate of selling only the percentage of pearls ad required by the United States. He claims that it would be very costly and difficult to develop a wide market for natural pearls now that they represent only 2$ of all pearl sales in the United States. He went to great pains to explain his knowledge of pearls and the wide variation of value placed upon them by members in the trade, also the tricky finesse needed to trade successfully. Ke continued with a statement that his firm operated at a loss during 194?. Although he told me lias rtrict confidence that he intends to go to the Persian Gulf when the pari fishing starts this summer, two other dealers have since informed me of his intentions. lie expressed a desire to discuss the subject with the British Consul therefore, i* you wish to see him perhaps you will arrange for a meting. His a ddress is 608 Fifth Avenue, New York City. Dr. A.E. Alexander stated the United States could absorb substantial quantities of natural parIs but it would cost money to develop the market. He stated that during his visit to Bahrein last, year, it was proposed to Sir Salman al Khalifa, the Sheik of Bahrein in the presence of Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave/Dalrymple Belgrave, C.B.E., Advisor to Bahrein Government, that the United States pearl dealers would work to create markets for Persian Gulf pearls, provided that fishery concessions were granted and $ 250,000 was advanced annually by the Sheik of Behrein for 4 years. There has been no response to the suggestion. Mr. Charles Murray of Cromur Inc., 630 Fifth Avenue, New York City, a pearl dealer who accompanied Dr. Alexander on his trip to Bahrein last year stated it was also proposed to the Sheik of Bahrein that as soon as a demand for pearls was established an export duty would be arranged to recoup finance advanced. He is particularly enthusiastic to play his part to develop a market as soon as pearls are available. He believes in a strong company to control the production and develop a sound market but claims nothing can be done v/ithout the assistance and co-operation of the British Government. Mr. Albert Osterwald, secretary of Pearl Associates, Inc. explained a 10 grain pearl costing a dealer $4000 in 1924 dropped to $400 after the crash in 1929, and the price has not recovered. Prices in Bombay have been too high to interest American importers but a small amount of trading has continued in second hand pearls. 11 Original Letter dated January 21, 1948 .m-mi, mxs mm block i-o a. s.^.c. wmi . mm M. BLOCH, ROCKEFELLER CENTRE, 610, FIFIK AVENUE, WV YORK. January 17, 19*8 ir. E#L*C* Tappin, l f Circle Road, Scarsdale, New York* Dear Mr* Tappin j With reference to your enquiry regarding pearls fron the Persian Oulf, I ?;ish to present the following: The embargo on shipments of pearls into India from the Persian Gulf has created a problem not too easy to overcome. It is difficult to transfer the pearl Industry, rhich has been built up over centuries in India, to tne United States. In the Persian Gulf, the merchandise ^hich can be considered as the most basic aspect of the fishery is the Khaia. (The name given to all the small pearls of 0.80 to 2.JO grains) In the past it was purchased by Indian merchants who imported them into Bombay, &gt;here they ^ere drilled, bleached and sorted into various qualities, sizes and colours for world distribution. The Indian workmanship Is very good and labour costs very low. India absorbed 20$ of the production of all qualities. Only the highest quality has been accepted on the United States market to now, representing a value approximately 20$ of production. Even If Bombay merchants could transfer business to the Persian Gulf they could not transfer their funds according to present regulations and therefore could not purchase in Bahrein, as they could only recover part of the purchase from the United States. Attempts might be made in the United States to drill and bleach the larger pearls as they are not so difficult to handle and would perhaps Justify the cost, but demand is negligible. I cannot see how an American concern could organize from the United Sta tes the replacement of the ancient Indian process when as besides the points exposed above there would constantly be the risk that the Indian Government might lift the embargo at any time and all the expenses and work would have been in vain. The only way this second risk could be avoided is by a concession granted covering the pearl fishing areas for 20 years, as has been done at different times in Venezuela during some 4-0 years and up to recently In the Dutch East Indies Fisheries Provided/—y-y Provided a concession is possible^ powerful company could be organized whereby the „ Bahrein would be invited to take a seat on the board, and consideration given to process the pearls also in England and France for guropean distribution* A big company can do so many things that private concerns cannot do t and provide stability in prices and outlay even in difficult periods. I would willingly take steps with colleagues in the trade to organize this undertaking. Much work and effort would have to be made to find suitable markets for the entire production of the Persian Gulf and to overcome the strong position of the so called cultured pearl and once again to present to the world an object of outstanding beauty to be treasured* to you. I hope that the above remarks may be useful Yours very truly, (Signed Bloch) ■'■naNl-item ri 'r'. &lt; . .i v» 5^ No. 486-80/4.

His Highness came to see me personally and made an impassioned appeal on this subject* As he says in his letter the peoples of the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf have for centuries existed on the pearl trade and the present restrictions have re sulted in great distress* A few pearls are being sold to American dealers and others but the only real market is Bombay where I understand there is a large Hindu community which earns its 'living by drilling, polishing, setting and marketing the pearls.

I have the honour to enclose a copy of a petition, which has been presented to us by the leading pearl merchants and owners of pearling dhows hi Bahrain, begging us to intercede on their behalf with the Governments of India who by forbid ding the entry of pearls into India have struck a crippling blow at the chief industry of the Persian Gulf. For many centuries diving for pearls has been the principal occupation of the people of the Gulf and Bahrain is the centre of this industry. Although in recent years the diving industry has suffered a decline yet still many thousands of our subjects are engaged in the work of diving and are dependent upon diving for their livelihood, similarly in the other Arab Btates of the Gulf, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman, and also along the Persian coast, thousands of men are employed during the summer months as divers. In the past the pearls from Bahrain and from Urie other Arab emirates were taken down every year, to Bombay whore they were sorted, .polished and drilled by Indians, then they were sold in the pearl market of Bombay to merchants who dis nosed of then in India and in foreign countries aoro&amp;d. Hegular employment was provided for the v 3e Indians who did the work on the pearls. How India has forbidden the import of pearls, This action is a disaster for the diving industry of the Gulf. Tiie pearl markets of India are closed against the Arabs of the Gulf, the Arab pearl merchants are facing ruin and thousands of men who have been divers all their lives will be without employment, because if pearls cannot be sold the diving fleets will not go to sea. The friendliest relations have always existed between Bahrain and indie, there is a large Indian community in Bahrain which includes many persons who depend upon the pearl incustry. In Bahrain Indians enjoy similar rights and conciitions to those which are enjoyed by the **r«bs of the country. Bahrain imports a great proportion of its food supplies, clothing and other necessities from India and oil from Bahrain is used all over India. The friendship between Bahrain and India is of long.standing, similarly the ether Arab States in the Gulf have long established economic and political relations with India. Admittedly pearls are luxury goods and it is understood that the Governments of India wishes to discourage the people of India from spending money on luxuries. It should be considered however that a large proportion of pearls which are iiaported into India are re-exported to Europe, the U.o.A. and to the otherforeign countries, by the Indian pearl dealers, who by this trade obtain foreign currency for India, but these ifiatters are well known to the Governments of India. Our own concern is the result of the action of the Governments of India on the thousands of poor arabs who are engaged in the pearl industry in the Gulf, especially those who are our own subjects in Bahrain. By forbidding the import of pearls into India the Governments of India will destroy an industry which for many centuriee has been the chief industry of the Gulf . The first action of India under its new constitution, which affects us, ia one which will do our country irreparable harm. • We have no means of bargaining with the Govern ments of India, we can only request you to put our case as strongly as possible, to the Government;) of Hindustan and Pakistan and earnestly to request them to alleviate the present situation by opening the door again for the import of pearls into India and by allowing the unrestricted sale of poerls in the markets of India.i c Translation of petition dated 22nd VAwal, 1367 (1 February 194a) from the Bahrain Pearl Merchants to His Highness the ftuj.er* uj Your Highness is aware of the restrictions made by the Governments of India recently on the entry of pearls and we have submitted to Your Highness on several occasions the harm these restrictions have caused us. We once zcore submit this petition hoping that it would meet with Your Highness 1 attention and care and that Your Highness would deliver us from the loss of our only means of livelihood. Bahrain is not the oni.y country which has been affected by these restrictions » the whole of the Persian Gulf has been affected, In particular the Arab States. We therefore pray that Your Highness may be pleased to take up this matter with the Governments of India and Pakistan and explain to them the undermentioned factst 7 / 1. Those who iive for pearls have no other means of livelihood, they are several thousands in number. Those who deal in this trade all these years know no other trade. There are Indians who earn thair living from this industry. They drill, polish and use the pearls In many ornanents and then sail to other merchants. 2. India itself has benefited from this industry because when pearls are polished, drilled and set in ornaments they export them to foreign countries, such as and the Far East. .Sometimes they export Gulf. Thus India is benefited from this those who dive for pearls are benefited. America, Europe them to the Persian industry more than 3. Though pearl is considered as a luxury but it is nothing when compared to the ether luxury goods etc. which the States of the Persian Gulf import from Indie. 4. The quantity of pearls produced in the recent years is very Jcant when compared vrith the cost ant 1 quantities pro« duced in the previous years. 6 . The entry of pearls into India is not a new thing. This trade with India has been going on since centuries. VJe pray to Your Highness to bestow Your Highness* sympathy and to take the matter up with the authorities con cerned and save us from a disaster.DRAFT LETTER 4^ Q Major L.A#C.

In my v judgement better results might be obtained by sending this correspondence to the U.K. High Commissioner in Hew Delhi in order that he might stimulate the authorities in India to greater efforts on the import of Persian Gulf pearls for re-export. It does not seem to me that sufficient has been made of this. As you may know the Government of India are themselves taking every step now to push their export trade realising how parlous their own financial position has become. It may be, therefore, that help to extend the export trade of Persian Gulf pearls would be appreciated. I think this would be a better way to tackle it and a copy of the letter to Symon might be sent to the Political Resident.P.G.

The extent to which this reauction may effect sales is probably limited, however, in view o:‘ the comparative price of natural pearls. 1 . ''VC4j2^v\) i Yours sincerelv.

New Tork Consulate-General SUBJECT The Market for Natural Pearls from the Persian Gulf in the U.S.A. 1 Imports of natural pearls into the United States are made by a few firms who operate independently except on exceptional occanons when a financial risk is too great. Although shrewd and keen competitors they have a great respect for each other, and joint ven tures are not difficult accomplishments. —. attached as Appendix 1. Two other names are excluded from this list since they wished to make specific suggestions before their names were sub mitted as potential buyers. Their names will be forwarded together with their comments when these come to hand, but since both parties are out of New fork it is not likely that these will be received before next year. 3. Notable personalities of past years in natural pearls, such as Leonard Rosenthal and others, are now dealing entirely in cultured pearls. 4. It appears that all the natural pearl traders have in the past, been completely dependent on the Indian pearl industry for drilling the pearls. The Indians also accomplished the art of bleaching with chemicals, and the aid of sunlight to improve the lustre which, was originated by the Persian Gulf natives. 5. B It is believed in the trade that pearls are still finding their way into India despite regulations prohibiting imports. The U.S. firms who are interested in Persian Gulf pearls are in a dilemma regarding the drilling in particular and the bleaching of pearls if the pearls cannot enter India. 6. These firms and other interested parties sent a mission to the Persian Gulf last June to investigate the situation. The mission was undertaken by Dr. A.E. Alexander of the Gem Laboratory Inc. and Mr. Charles Murray, of 636 Fifth Avenue, who discovered the native ruler of Bahrein wanted 1^ million dollars before he would entertain suggest ions. They accomplished little, but their experience did not entirely discourage would-be importers and merchants who are still willing to buy from the Persian Gulf. 7 . It is considered that developing a market for the larger sizes requires unique skill, particularly to overcome the publicity given at the present time to the cultured pearl. The United States firms interested in the Persian Gulf pearls are ready to use their best endeavours to create a demand for all sizes of natural pearls, if they can overcome the difficulties outlined above. 8. A report on the Pearl Market submitted by Mr. Rene Block of 610 Fifth Avenue is attached as Appendix II to this memorandum. Mr. Block is acknowledged in the trade as being ”quite a fighter for the natural pearl”. A list of four of the principal importers of natural pearls is BRITISH CONSULATE-GENERAL, NEW YORK 4. 15th December 1947 PM:MFAPPENDIX I LIST OF PRINCIPAL IMPORTERS OF NATURAL PEARLS Raundeim, Juluis &amp; Co., 608 Fifth Avenue, New York City 20.

December, PMrMF 1947appendix II Confidential October 1944 THE PL All L LIARKET Financial Aspect The international pearl market has up to now remained in the state of depression into which it had been thrown by the crisis of 1929. Without examining in detail all the elements which determined this state of affairs, it can be said that the competition of Japanese cultured pearls - pearls made of a foreign substance, a mass of mother-of- pearl of no value covered with a thin coat of pearly material- has not been counteracted in a suitable manner. The public was not warned against this Japanese trash - introduced under the equivocation of the word ,, cultured ,, - and was allowed to believe that cultured pearls are similar to natural pearls which is false. Also no effort has been made, no initiative undertaken, no group formed to fight with adequate means the disfavor into which the natural pearl had unjustifiably fallen. In fact the price of pearls had fallen to a level representing less than 10 % of that which obtained in 1928-1929. Prices have risen noticeably since last year and have reached now, according to quality, 15 to 20 % of the old prices. Many reasons militate in favor of a rapid and lasting acceleration of this rise. First are the general reasons for the increase in prices of merchandise, because of the automatic process of the monetary depreciation. Then are the special reasons for the increase in price of the fine pearl: 1. Increase in price at the source. In Bombay pearls of certain sizes and qualities have almost tripled in price in the last two years. Even at these prices it is practically impossible to obtain them. All efforts made by certain New York merchants to buy pearls in Bombay have remained more or less unsuccessful. It must be remembered that Bombay is the most important commercial market for oriental pearls found in the Persian Gulf, particularly for most of the production of the Island of Bahrein. At Bahrein the production of the fisheries decreases from year to year. The number of divers which, twenty years ago, was about 60,000 is now under 6,000. Powerful oil refineries which have been built in recent years at Bahrein after the discovery of oil in that area, pay higher wages than the fisheries, especially as the fisheries work only about four months a year. Hov/ever, as divers share in the profits of the • boats for which they work, higher market prices would undoubtedly assure a continuation of supply. The markets of France and Great Britain were supplied almost exclusively by Bombay and the United States obtained its pearls from these two countries. The importation of pearls into the United States reached/reached a yearly average of $10 millions during the period from 1920 to 1930. This importation diminished progressively to $200,000 in 1942 and to practically nothing in 1943. 2. Healthy situation of the pearl market in the United States. The stocks are really insignificant in value in relation to the buying power of the country. They are in the hands of a few powerful New York retail houses and several wealthy dealers. The middle and small fetailers have practically nothing. Thus the market is healthy. In view of the assets of pearlr merchandise, there is no corresponding liability. 3. Sincerity of price observed on fine pearls. The prices result from the free play of the law of supply and demand. This is not the case with all other gems, particularly with the diamond, in which powerful English financial organizations are limiting production, regulating the distribution and consequently fixing the price arbitrarily, a procedure which is a real danger. The purchase of fine pearls offers more security as an investment than the purchase of diamonds 4. Gradual disappearance of Japanese pearls, called “cultured“ from the market. Their prices have gone up more than ten times in the last two years and will continue to rise. The pro hibition against importing them will probably last long after the war. In short, it has been seen, all the technical reasons are in favor of an increase in the price of pearls. The consumption has a tendency to increase because of a need to use up surplus money. Favorable publicity would easily encourage an important acceleration of the movement. A cursory examination of the question will show that the impetus is easy to give and the publicity is easy to make. Commercial Aspect In the present situation where the use of precious metals is regulated if not practically forbidden to the jeweler and where skilled labor has pretentions which render the manufacture of mounted jewels very difficult and burdensome, it is of inestimable advantage to be able to utilize pearls which are sufficient in themselves. A pearl necklace is a thing of beauty in^itself. It has no need of a mounting or setting of any kind. it can readily be enlarged or modified which is of advantage to the jeweler. And finally, publicity for the pearl is easy ahd of infinite variety. Pearls have been known since the earliest days. In India they have been considered sacred; the Hindus venerate them as attributes of divinity. Womenfeel that they are protected by pearls from an evil fate. Mythology dedicates the pearl to Venus. The pearl has at all times been the preferred gem of the great people of the world from the Pharaohs, the Chinese Emperors, the Hajahs, to the Greeks and Homans. It has remained so with modern rulers. The Queen of England, members of royal families and all the great ladies of English and American society are never with out their necklaces which they wear in one, two or even triple strands. It is supreme in jewelry and without her pearls a woman of quality is never completely dressed It is the only jewel which can be worn as well during the day or night, on a dress, a blouse or on the satin of the skin. Contrary to other jewelry which often does not complement certain costumes' or gives the appearance of a display of riches in bad taste, the pearl necklace, a pearl at the lobe of the ear or on the finger, always adds to the natural distinction of those who wear them. A woman who has a pearl necklace of natural, fine pearls is proud of it. She never feels completely dressed, nor completely at her esthetic best without her necklace of pearls. A woman is never perfectly beautiful without it. 12th December, 194-7.MEMORANDUM R3GARDING THE MARKET POSSIBILITIES OP NATURAL PEARL Several of the largest jewellery houses in this ^_area have been contacted regarding the market possibilities of natural pearls. They inform us that cultured pearls have nearly supplanted the use of natural pearls in this market.

'(ittiat we can and should hope for is close commercial relations between the G-ulf States and Pakistan, Most of the Hindu traders in the G-ulf States come from Sind and formerly had their business connections in Karachi, With the exodus of Hindus from Sind these connections have been transferred elsewhere but it seems likely that the Hindus who have left Sind will return there in due course. The Pakistan authorities have already shown signs of being co-operative so far as the G-ulf States are concerned and should Karachi revive as a business centre I think the Gulf trade could look for more favourable treatment there than in India, Malik Peroz Khan Noon for instance when he was here promised to get the embargo on the import of pearls lifted so far as Pakistan is concerned. This in itself is useless as all the Hindus who are expert in the processing of the pearls (l have been told that about 100,000 depend on this for their living) are resident in Bombay. It is possible however that if it becomes known that pearls can be freely imported to Karachi but not to Bombay the Hindus who depend upon this trade for their living will in due course transfer themselves to the former place.Ext.289A3 Extract frcan Bahrein Intelligence Summary .for .period 1 st to 15th January: 1°. £EARLS At a meeting held at the Adviserate on the 6 th of January, 1948, His Highness Sheikh SALMAN BIN HaMAD was urged \jy the leading pearl merchants who attended it, to take all measures possible, in conjunction with the Ruler of Saudi Arabia and other Rulers of the Gulf States, to forbid the entry of foreign pearls into the Gulf States. The meeting was called because during the last few days packets of Vene- suelan pearls and also pearls from the Red Sea were alleged to have been sent to Bahrein pearl merchants for disposal. The merchants represented that the pearl trade had been seriously hit by Indian ban on their entry into that country and that this latest danger would strike another blow at the industry.

The Counsellor(Commercial) at Tehran reports that his Market Investigation Officer, who has had 25 years experience in the country, informed him that Persia is already a market for Gulf pearls, although it would be difficult to estimate the importance of the trade as practically all of them are smuggled into the country. He points out that where the Persian authorities cannot prevent sugar and tea being smuggled in by the dhow-load, it is absolutely impossible for them to prevent small packages of pearls being brought in, and in his opinion it is safe to say that not 5% of the pearls on the Persian market have ever paid duty. Canada . The Trade Commissioner at Winnipeg reports that there is little or no market for pearls in his area, suchas are needee from time to time for replacement purposes are bought from supplies in Montreal or Toronto. there is only a small local market for natural pearls, the majority of those used being of the manufactured type.

Thus the ox ficial value of imports for 19 A -5 nnd 194-6 was approxi mately Esc. 700,000 and Esc. 750,000 respectively. The ain supplier was the U.S.A., then Japan, India and the U.K. There is thus a possibility that the Persian Gulf pearls might find a market here. The most probably importers are : - Jose Ramos, Lda., Rua do Ouro, 280-12, Lisbon. iiartins, Lda., Rua dos Fanqueiros, 390-22, Lisbon Armando Halpern, Rua da Hadalena, 182-22, Lisbon B.

The above are the principal Portuguese importers of precious stones and the like.ll jllW—W* 'The Government of India, it is officially announced, has decided to allow into the country limited imports of uncut diamonds and other precious stones, unpolished pearls and rough synthetic stones for the specific purpose of being cut, polished or finished in India and re-exported.

The Board of Trade . have also asked their men in Canada, U.S.A. Portugal, Uruguay, Iraq, Syria and Persia to report on the prospects for Persian Gulf pearls in those countries. The results are not yet in. Whatever those results may be^we still feel that some attempt should be made to find the solution of the problem within the y [ Indian orbit. We cannot press the Indians freely to license , the import of pearls (incidentally it was not only from the Gulf that India imported pearls in the past) 9 but we wondered whether they might not be prepared to consider doing something on the lines of the Board of Trade’s scheme here - i.e. permitting the import of pearls at least to some extent, subject to re-export of a high percentage by value, and trying to build up a re-export trade connection with hard currency f^o'l 1947 ( h/ih Q-t fa* . ^) *v countries.

If they were to be imported otherwise than by country craft, an import licence would be required. 2. This information is supported by the India Supply Commission in London. If there is any further difficulty, * the Political Resident might like to consider whether he might not pursue his enquiries through the local United Kingdom representative (whether Deputy High Commissioner or Trade Commissioner, perhaps preferably the former) at the port to which it is proposed to ship the dates. 3. You might like to pass this to the Political Resident as a part answer to his telegram. 4. Pearls a re definitely on the list of goods whose .import into India will not be licensed at all. I note that consideration is being given by the Board of Trade to other outlets; and we shall probably need more time to think about this. I wonder £very tentatively indeed^whether we might not see if an arrangement could be come to with the G-overnment of India, whereby the pearls could be shipped to Bombay for re-export only. But I do not suggest you say anything about this yet. 3. We discussed the general financial set-up and thought is being given to it here, l have taken a copy the /penultimatepenultimate paragraph of your note. It seems at first sight as though, v/hile political control has been shifted from Delhi to London, no-one has yet thought abou t*the more complicated problem of disentangling monetary control; and it seems to me that this may result in anomalies prejudicial to the interests of the Gulf States and^. so^I suppose, to our own interests. We are thinking about this here and will hope to let you know more before long.

Muscat*s annual export of dates to India is roughly 10,000 half 20,000 tons of which 90 half IfJO per cent represents dry dates. This year permits have been granted so far for 2000 half 4000 tons only and importers telegraph that further permits are not forthcoming. So tar as wet dates are concerned it is possible that other markets could be found. But dry dates (90 half 180 per cent of total crop) which are made from an inferior date have already been dried and there is no repeat no other market except India for them. If therefore permits are not forthcoming not only will merchants who have already bought crops suffer grave loss but effect on Muscat economy will be disastrously (? omission) since it depends practically entirely on these exports to finance imports from India of general merchandise. Muscat's imports from India are in excess of exports to India. 3 # Dry dates are made from dates of such inferior quality that even if drying process of this year's crop had not already been completed they could not compete in normal wet date market. Any failure in Indian dry date market would therefore bring ruin to Batinah Coast. 4 # There are also indications that import permits for dry fish are being seriously curtailed.

We are also exploring the position of potential interest by the United Kingdom industry in Birmingham, with ultimate re-export in view, and I will be writing to you again shortly on this angle. Yours sincerely.&lt; The Government of India have recently reviewed .heir entire Import Trade Control policy with a view to making the best possible use of India’s foreign exchange resources and to restrict imports of certain consumer and other non-essential goods which have arrived in the country in very substantial quantities. The new policy came into force on 1st July from which date licences for certain goods (including unset pearls) would not be issued for the present. Where orders had been placed before 16th May, 1947, licences would be issued for these goods provided they were shipped up to 30th September, 1947. 2. I am quite clear that in view of the reasons underlying the Government of India’s embargo on imports of pearls that we could not now press them to modify that embargo. To do so would be to invite them to ask us to revise the sterling balance settlement to provide the currency to finance such luxury imports. There are many far more essential things than pearls which the Government of India are having to shut out completely meantime because of the very tight exchange position. I have discussed the telegram from the Political Resident with the Treasury and they entirely agree with the view which I have here expressed. 3. It is of course unfortunate that the Persian Gulf pearl trade should be disrupted but there are a good few other luxury trades which are likely to go to the wall in the next few years while the economic blizzard is blowing. Some mitigatronTfef the embargoes placed on imports of pearls into countries such as India and - the United Kingdom might be secured from pursuing your—p —1 ' ■ ■ suggestion of selling to America. For this purpos* the treasury suggest that you should send a copy of the Political Resident’s telegram to Mr. A.E. Welch, Export Promotion Department, Board of Trade, 35, Old Queen Street,and suggest to him that some steps might be taken with our representatives, possibly in America, to see whether .some sales of Gulf pearls could be made to the Americans for dollars. Would you be good enough to send a copy of your fetter to Mr. Van Loo, Treasury, together with a copy'of the telegram from the Political Resident. v hL)SECRET No.13 of 1947 Extract from Intelligence Summary for period 1st to 15th August, 1947* x x x x 3 . 65 . EEARLS . Mr. Henry C.sVynant, an American Pearl and Gem dealer established in Bombay, visited Bahrain in the middle of the month to investigate the possibility of establishing an ol 1 ice here to buy pearls because of the ban on imports of pearls into India. He expects to return to Bahrain and to spend the winter here. He is primarily interested in the better grades of seed pearl for setting in brooches. He expects to be able to buy the entire season's catch of this type of pearl in the Persian G-ulf. He will pay for them initially in sterling (because he has balances that he has so far been unable to utilise), and ultimately in dollars.

Dear Welch, I enclose for your information a copy of telegram No. V695 dated the 27th August, 1947, which we have received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. to review India's entire Import Trade Control policy with a view to making the best possible use of India's foreign exchange resources and to restrict imports of certain consumer and non-essential goods. The new policy came into force on the 1st July from which date import licences for certain goods, including unset pearls, are not to be issued for the present. As India has for some time been the principal market for pearls from the Persian Gulf, this embargo will have a serious effect on the economic life of the Gulf States unless alternative markets can be found. 3* It appears to be quite clear that, in view of the reasons underlying the Government of India's embargo on import of pearls, we could not now press India to modify this embargo. The Treasury concur with this view, but have suggested that your representatives in America and other countries likely to be interested might be able to assist in finding alternative markets. We should be grateful if you examine this suggestion and let us know as soon as possible whether you have been able to pursue it. You may be interested to see in this connection the enclosed extract from a Bahrein Intelligence Summary for the first half of August. 4.

DepartmentV- nil P Y Cep rs ^ ' M Though economic depression in Europe and America and the unhappy state of world politics, together with the increased export of the inferior cultured pearl from Japan, have caused a Ion*' continued slump in the pearl market, pearl diving still remains the most important indigenous industry of the Arab o uates on the west coast of the Persian Gulf* Every year thousands of Arabs sail out from the main ports at the beginning of the warm weather to the pearl banks which stretch along the Arabian Coast almost from Kuwait to Dubai. Probably the richest banks are those within easy sailing distance of Bahrain, to the north and eas' of the Island, and Bahrain has for centuries been the chief pearl market of the Gulf* Indeed at one time almost a thousand boats of all descriptions, sambuks, batails, jollyboats and booms used to leave Bahrain for diving; though now scarcely a third of this number £o out. There have been particularly prosperous years when catches were good and prices were high and when the value of the pearls exported from Bahrain reached the prodigious figure of two million pounds; now, owing to the depression and the cultured pearl, the figure is barely one-tenth of that sum. 2* The following description of the organisation of the industry applies particularly to Bahrain, where His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa al Khalifah and his Government have introduced extensive reforms in the diving laws in order to ' protect the interests of the divers. 3. The diving season is divided into three parts; the early 'small dive' in shallow water near the coast, in which few boats now participate; the 'big dive' which is the main operation and lasts roughly from the middle of May till the or closure in September;and the 'reddah' or return dive after ohe QU.ffal, in which again comparatively few boats participate, usually those who have been unsuccessful in the main dive.4. The most common arrangement followed in Bahrain is for the captain (nakhuda) of a 'boat to borrow money from one of the hip merchants some time before the diving* season starts* and from this he pays advances to his crew at rates fixed by proclamation. From these advances the divers make provision for their families, and the captain uses the rest of the borrowed money to equip his boat for the season and to purchase provisions. Then on a day fixed for the big dive, the pearling fleet seta out for the various banks. Boats from any of the rab Shaikhdoms may go to any of the banks from one end of the Gulf to the other, but naturally they usually go to those wichin reasonable distance of their own home ports* It is interesting to note that the manner of diving has scarcely changed in the last five hundred years. The crew of each boat consists of the divers or ghasah ; the haulers or siyub * who haul the divers to the surface and do most of the sailing; possibly an extra hand or two known as radhlf . and one or two young boys to catch fish, prepare coffee and so on. On the banks the work goes on ever/ day when the weather is calm, living usually starts about an hour after sunrise and each diver strips off his clothes, puts a bone clip (fatan) on his nostrils and fixes leather sheaths ( khabat ) on his fingers and toes to protect them from abrasions. He slings around his neck a string bag in which he puts the oysters and he has two ropes to aid him in diving. One of these has a heavy stone attached which pulls him to the bottom; there the diver leaves go of this rope and it is immediately pulled up again while the diver gropes his way along the bottom and collects the oysters. These are some times lying loosely on sand and in other places are attached to coral or sea weed. V/hen the diver cannot hold his breath any longer — usually after about one minute — he gives a tug on the/7/ 3. \ the second rope and is then pulled to the surface by his hauler. He then rests for a few minutes and repeats the process, descending possibly 30 to 50 times in a day and often to a depth of over 70 feet. As the work goes on the shells are heaped on the deck of the boat and are usually opened after the dawn prayers on the following day. The opening of the shells is carefully watched by the nakhuda who collects any pearls that may be found and locks them away in his chest. When storms blow up, as they frequently do in the Persian Gulf, the whole pearling fleet returns to harbour or shelters behind an island or a reef until conditions become more favourable again for diving. These storms of course provide an interval for rest, for cleaning the boats and for renewing provisions. 5. In the old days the pearls were kept by the captain of the boat till the end of the season and then sold on final return to port. Nowadays merchants go out from Manama in launches and purchase many of the pearls on the banks. The fin^l sales take place in Manama after the quffal and then loans and advances are adjusted and the balance is shared out. A certain number of divers, chosen by their comrades from each boat, watch the sales and are thus in a position to know how much will be due to them. When all expenses have been met the captain takes one-fifth of the total profits and the remainder is divided among the divers and the haulers, each diver receiving two shares and each hauler one. 6. The work is strenuous and conditions are hard, but on ohe whole the divers are very healthy and suffer little ill effect from their frequent dives. While they are at work they take neither food nor drink, but they have a light meal at dawn and after sunset a good meal of rice, dates and dried fish. In the evening nakhudas and their crews visit other boats for coffee and conversation.7, After the nakhuda has sold his pearls in Manama, there comes the haggling and bargaining among the merchants, and in this process good pearls are often sold and resold several times, the price of the pearl increasing twice or three-fold* The unit of sale is called a chau, which is not itself a weight but is a mathematical calculation derived from the actual weight of the pearl* The value of the pearl is determined not only by the number of chaua it contains but also by its shape, colour and by the lustre of its 'skin”* It is interesting to watch two merchants buying and selling a pearl of which they wish to keep the price secret* Each of them places his hand under a cloth or under a table and they conduct the bargaining by signs; for instance a grasp of the whole hand may mean Rs* 1000:- a touch on the palm Rs* 500:- the pressure of one finger Rs* 100:- and so on. Finally when all the local buying and selling is finished the pearls are usually taken to Bombay or Paris and there sold to the big Indian and European jewellers*^ ^ ■ Dwur Belgrade, 1 &lt;17tr\rt‘ i v /?&gt; tfy- l^*Z&gt;9oaaber+ 1%&gt;5* I have had a iwti with the Board of Trade upon the question of your getting la touch r/ith Laadoa jeweller 6 with a view to their sending hqyers out to Bahreln&lt;rlfcMa|B**t that It sight perhaps be a good thing if you got in touch with the London Jewellers ' Council, 7 f Hatton Garden, £*C*1« 9 although there wo ld, of course, be no objection to your contacting individual firms as you suggest, such es Cartiers. * C.

Of course if someone who was not a real expert went out and tried to buy pearls it would be he who would be in difficulties, not the Arab sellers, who know the business inside out. I have heard lately complaints from people in the jewel trade in London that some Americans are buying up all the pearls on the Bombay market with the result that when the London men want pearls, from the Gulf, they have to buy thepa from America at much enhanced prices. I believe it would be an excellent thing for Bahrain if sane of the London firms, such as Cartier, sent a buyer to Bahrain. 9\ \ImR x x 80. Pearl Trade. It is probable that the pearl dive this year from Bahrain, Sharjah, and Dubai will be on a much reduced scale. This is due to the absence of rice and the difficulty of cooking wheat and baking bread in small over crowded sailing vessels and also to a certain extent to the demand for unskilled labour at all these three places. It is probable that the numbers taking part in the dive frcm other parts of the Trucial Coast and Qatar may be much the same as usual but their range will be restricted as the absence rice will necessitate frequent returns to port tar re-victaulling. x x X X Xbifastaxr mail.

He spoke in general terms about pearling and said that it would be a good thing if a close season could be introduced and the pearling cut down to a couple of months each year. The Political Agent replied that, while an excellent idea, any thing of this sort would have to be arranged by the common consent of the Rulers concerned and that it would be very difficult for Government to do anything*?

Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 29145/1933 of the 2nd Novemher 1933, concerning pearl-fishing in the Lead Sea, I have the honour to report that the Saudi Arab Government have granted to Sheykh Abdurrahman Qusaibi a concession for pearl-fishing along the coasts of this kingdom* Little is known of tbe terms of this concession, whichwas first heard of in oeptember of this year and of which no account has as yet been published, although it is alleged that the concession is a monopoly and moreover applies to both Led Sea and Persian Gulf shores of the Saudi Arab Kingdom. 2. Sheykh Abdurrahman Qusaibi is a member of the merchant family of that name in the Persian Gulf, whose firm is, as you are aware, well known both in Surope and India as dealers in pearls. It is under stood that Ibn Baud has now granted them this con cession for a period of fifteen years against, in all probability, a remission of some part of the lar^e debt ?/hich he had owed the firm for several years. The concessionaire is said to have agreed to the annual payment of twenty per cent of the gross profit derived from the concession and to have made Ibn Baud The Principal Becretary of Btate for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade.an advance of five hundred pounds gold to he repaid hy deduction from the first and if necessary subse quent payments due to the Government. 3. As a result of the concession a party of sane seventeen Venezuelan and Chilean pearl divers with equipment, arrived in Jedda early in September under the leadership of a Syrian-Venezuelan named oalim Abouhamad, stated by the 1'rench Consulate here to be a Maronite Christian belonging to a family well-known in the Lebanon, and proceeded to inspect along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia from Wejh in the north of Jizan and the Farasan Islands in the south. The partjr returned to Jedda this month. 4. It is reported that Salim Abouhamad is favourably impressed by the commercial possibilities of exploita tion, especially in the south, northern shores having on the whole proved disappointing, but thinks it necessary to prohibit all pearl-fishing for two years in order to nurse the beds which at present contain chiefly small sized shells of little value. Sheykh Abdurrahman is said to be making proposals to this effect to the Saudi Arab Government but the king*s reaction is still unknown. 5. The experiment so far has involved Sheykh Abdurrahman Qusaibi, on his own admission, in financial loss and it remains to be seen whether these first efforts will be followed up. At any rate Salim Abouhamad*s contract with Qusaibi seems to be at an end with his return, and he and his party are under stood to be preparing to leave the country. At first a return ticket to Venezuela was foreshadowed but nowit is “believed that Salim Ahouhamad is suffieiently impressed hy the possibilities at the southern end of the ±ted Sea to approach the Italian authorities in Eritrea with a proposal for a concession for himself there, ne now intends to visit Massawa touching on the way at -tiudeyda, with a view, perhaps, to explore the possihilitj.es of securing a concession from the Imam of the Yemen as well. 6.

K&gt;L‘ 6 FEB 1955 Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. The Saudi Government have granted a concession for pearl fishing in Saudi waters to Abdurrahman Qusaibi 7 apparently in return for a remission of debt and a further advance of £500 to Ibn Saud. It is alleged that the concession is a monopoly and that it applies not only to the Red Sea but also to the Persian Gulf shores of Saudi Arabia. If this is in fact true there are possibilities of trouble with the Saudis over the rights of our Arab proteges in the Persian Gulf, since previously urv oJrda\j) the pearl banks^have been considered the common property of the pearl fishermen whatever their nationality. On the other hand there has been no sign as yet of any attempt on the part of Abdurrahman Qusaibi to develop his concession in/in the Persian Gulf, although certain exploratory work has been done on the Red Sea side of the pen^insula. The suggestion in paragraph 4 of the Jedda despatch that it would be a good thing to prohibit all pearl fishing for two years in order to nurse the beds is interesting. ^ Similar suggestions have recently been made in other quarters (see the extract from the Koweit Intelligence Summary at P.Z. 6999/34 below).COPY . 29146/1933 O.T» 53 &gt; (3262/3625/2).

Pearling Season . The pearling season was officially closed on the End October 1934, by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E.,C.S.I.,Ruler of Kuwait,who visited the pearling banks in his yacht, for the purpose. The pearling boats started arriving bacx on the 3rd October,when Kuwait 'Niqa' (inner harbour) was a scene of great excitement. The season’s pearl catch was exceptionally poor - less than half in value of that of the previous season. Only one Kuwait boat was lucky enough to get a 'Hasba' (big pearl) which fetched Rs.14,000/-, while only half a dozen other pearls fetched prices ranging from Rs.3,000 to Rs.6000. One old and prominent pearl merchant told the writer that the trouble lay in the fact that the oysters nowadays seemed to be failing to produce pearls and the number of oysters caught which failed to produce a pearl was very greatly in excess of what was the case 10 to 15 years ago. He opined that possibly (a) Poison from the Oil Refinery at Abadan or Oil driven ships in the Gulf were affecting the productivity of the oyster beds: (b) That the beds were getting worked out seeing that /that what with 'Radda' and 'Khanchiyeh' seasons, as well as the 'Ghaus' proper the said beds only get 3 months rest in the year. He further opined that matters had grown so serious, that it behoved the Rulers of Kuwait, Bahrain, Q^itar and Trucial Coast to petition His Majesty 1 s Government to appoint a I 'Commission' to make thorough enquiry into the matter,with a view to making recommendations for (a) Closed season on certain Banks, (b) Stopping all fishing except during the Ghaus.To Chairman Under Secretary Secretary of £ftate Committee Under Secretary..

Colonel Colville is informed that the patent rights in this apparatus are owned by The Critonia forwarding Mr* Barouk*s enquiry to the Political Resident at Bushire, in the belief that His Majesty’s Government might view with disfavour the introduction of modern diving equipment in the Persian Gulf on the grounds that such a departure would inevitably lead to the crippling, if not the eventual extinction of, the native pearl fishing industry which forms so important a proportion of the economic wealth of the native inhabitants* 4.

Prices are at least 25^ higher than in the past year, and great local benefit has been obtained by the exceptionally fine 'Raddah' (divers T own diving) which is still in progress owing to the unusual calm weather prevailing. All the profits from this diving go direct into the divers’ pockets and much distress will be alleviated by this. Some small boats have done better in the 'Raddah” diving (the return diving) than in the Diving Season proper. 2. it is understood that a leading firm of pearl traders has been able to obtain from a Paris Bank and London Bank an overdraft against a security of pearls, or probably against the increased credit brought about by the improved prices for pearls. As the Banks have, for sometime, refused such drafts, the fact that they have now done so, is a hopeful sign. Hindu merchants are also accepting pearls as security. It is understood that they consider that pearls have reached their lowest prices and that they, therefore, $re better and surer security than any other commodity.CB.

Moreover, were such a venture by Britisn subjects countenanced by us it would be difficult, if not impossible, to oppose the intrusion of Foreign European nationals engaging in a similar venture.

I told him that he would probably receive a reply on the general lines of the draft, but took the opportunity to add that a more substantial difficulty was that ary interference by outsiders with the preserves of the Arab fishermen would undoubtedly be strenuously resisted (particularly at the present time, when the pearl market was glutted and as a result considerable hardship was being experienced in the Gulf areas which depended on it), and must be attended by considerable risk. I added that he would appreciate the difficulties which would be caused to H.M.G. in their task of keeping order in these areas by any incident, and said that I thought we should much prefer that matters should be left as they were.

So early as 1857 the view was accepted hy Government that it was inexpedient that British subjects should engage in the pearl fishery in the Persian Gulf which was regarded as being the monopoly of the local Arab tribes. In 1911 the Trucial Sheikhs, the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Sheikh of Koweit » gave undertakings not to respond to overtures from any quarter for concessions for fishing on pearl banks over which they have pearling rights,without first consulting the Resident throu^i the Residency Agent, and they agreed to grant no concessions save with^ut^the approval of H.LI.G. In 1914 American enquirers as to pearl culture and the methods of the industry were put off by the Government of India/mmm 'T' .»« India (P.2830/14), and obstacles had previously- been put in the way of other alien enquirers. It will be seen that Colonel Barrett has endeavoured to head off the present xjnerican enquiry. On the question of the cultivation of cultured pearls in Bahrein, the Political Resident’s reply to the Political Agent, Bahrein, seems entirely to dispose of the matter.

Cultivation of Cultured pearls in Bahrein. I have the honour to forward a copy of the 1.

Letter Ho.1448 dated the 20th June 1929,] which has passed between the from the Secretary to the Political j Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the } Political Agent, Bahrein and Political Agent, Bahrein. ) this office’ on the subject of scheme for the cultivation of cultured pearls in Bahrein and I trust that the Government of India approve of my ruling on the question raised by the Political Agent. I have, etc., Sd. C.C.J.Barrett, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.Ho.C/77 of 2nd June 1929 The Political Agency, Bahrein Prom Captain C.G. Prior, Political Agent, Bahrein, To The Secretary to the Political Resident in the P er si an Gulf, Bu shire• Sir, I have received a letter from the Adviser to the Bahrein Government in which he tells me that he has information leading him to suppose that Abdul Rahman Qusaibi will attempt to start the cultivation of cultured pearls in Bahrein. He suggests that whether the information be true or not, legislation might be considered with a view to prevent this. 2. There is no need for me to point out the harm that would result to the Pearling industry of Bahrein if it were to be suspected by the big buyers that cultured pearls were being made / on the banks here. Bahrein pearls are celebrated for their colour, quality and lustre, and any suggestion that they were being tampered with would have a most serious effect on all connected with the industry. 3. While it will not be difficult for the Bahrein Government to prevent their own subjects manufacturing such pearls, yet it will be impossible for them to exercise any control over foreigners doing so on the Banks, for as the then Political the Banks are free to all, and should for example a Persian desire to commence such an industry it would be hard to prevent him. The only way that this could be done would be to extend the Bahrein Order in Council to the Banks or to secure an would presumably include the Persian Government. ( A question which has not yet arisen this year but which may be raised in an acute form before long ip the use by Persians of proper diving Agent mentioned in para. 4 of his letter Ho.247 dated 1.12*29 agreement between all/ Governments who send divers there. This _ —- — — If diving apparatus, and this if insisted on would undouttediy cause a free fight at the Banks) « 4 , I confess that I am ignorant of the chances of raising cultured pearls successfully in the free-for-all conditions that obtain here. I understand that such pearls take a considerable time to grow, and I see no means of the cultivators protecting their oysters during the pearls’s infancy. The problem must have arisen in Ceylon and I suggest the Ceylon Government be asked for information in the matter. 5. The possibility of successfully producing such pearls does not alarm me as much as Mr. Belgrave, but even the threat of it will have an adverse effect on our stample industry and I should be glad to know the views of the ‘ Hon’ble the Political Resident in the matter. I have, etc. ,$ Ho.1448 of 192^. British Residency and Consulate General, Bushire, the 20th June 1929. To The Political Agent, Bahrein. Sir, With reference to your letter Ho.C/77, dated the 2nd June 1929, I am directed to inform you that the trade in cultured pearls has already 'been prohibited by the Shaikh of Bahrein and the prohibition would naturally apply to any cultured pearls produced by Abdul Rahman qusaibi. The Hon’ble the Political Resident believes that the Arab divers and merchants whose livelihood would be threatened by Qusaibi's action, may be trusted effectively to prevent his profiting at their expense. As the pearl banks are free to all no individual Arab or Persian Government could afford him the protection he would require to bring to maturity any plan he may have conceived. In the case of a fracas at sea appearing imminent H.M’s Government, in view of its position as Policeman of the seas of the Persian Gulf, would interfere to preserve order and could then presumably adjudicate in the dispute. There is, however, no likelihood that events will reach this stage as Abdul Rahman Qusaibi knows the strength of Arab feeling in the matter. I have, etc. , Sd. A.A.Russell, Captain, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

The majority of this correspondence is between British officials but the file also contains correspondence from a number of external parties interested in gaining access to the Persian Gulf pearl market. The British officials are from the Board of Trade, the Government of India, the Political Agency in Bahrain and the Political Residency in Bushire (Bahrain after 1946).Much of the correspondence contained in the file relates to an attempt by British authorities to find an alternative export market for Persian Gulf pearls after the newly independent Government of India imposed a ban on the importation of these pearls into the country.The file also contains correspondence related to the importation of dates from the Gulf into India, the granting of a pearl diving concession in Saudi Arabia and several other matters that primarily relate to external parties enquiring for information regarding the Gulf's pearling industry.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>International trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000119#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
