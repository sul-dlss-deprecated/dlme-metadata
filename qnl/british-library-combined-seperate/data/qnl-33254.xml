The letter concerns correspondence that is being forwarded to the Captain, shipping movements to and from Bushire, the expected arrival of 500 men to garrison Karrack and the mysterious arrival in Bushire of Abdella Khan. The latter has expressed concern over the departure of General Malcolm and Captain Pasley to India and Bussorah [Basra] respectively.2. Letter from William Bruce to Captain Charles Pasley, Acting Envoy Extraordinary to Persia, dated 24 August 1808. The letter discusses a visit to the Resident by Mohumed Hossain Khan and Aga Mohumed Jaffer, who delivered Persian letters on behalf of Abdella Khan. During their visit the departure of General John Malcolm and Captain Pasley was discussed, as was why company goods had been shipped out from the factory at Bushire; for the latter the threat of the Wahabees [Wahabi] to Bushire is cited as the motivation. In addition to this, the subject of a building that the Shaik [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān] is constructing against the wishes of the Government at Sheraz [Shiraz] is raised.3. Translation of a letter from William Bruce to Abdella Khan, dated 19 August 1808.
