Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received September 27.) (No. 426.) !Sir, Gulhek, September 5, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 336 of the 7th July last, enclosing a report by His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz upon the Rowanduz route, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith an interesting memorandum by Mr. Simmonds, commercial secretary at this Legation, upon the future prospects of this route. 2. You will see that Mr. Simmonds does not consider that this route can ever compete seriously with the Batoum, or even the Trebizond, routes. Its value in Persian eyes doubtless consists in the fact that it affords a bolt-hole in the event of complete intransigence on the part of the Soviet Government. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 72) and to His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz (No. 32). Rowanduz Road. I WENT over this road between the 17th and 20th August in company with Major Pybus, who is, I understand, preparing a detailed report. The condition and nature of this road have already been very fully described by Mr. Stanhope Palmer, and there is not much that I can usefully add to his reports. At present the surface of the road is generally bad, to put it mildly, and in many stretches it consists of badly defined and unmetalled track, although in other cases a new road is under construction. It is quite possible for a private car or lorrv to reach the Irao frontier from Tabriz in one day at this time of the Nathaniel's lorries can now get no ireignt num .oaguciu lu xaunz-, tm-nuugn freight is offered to a certain extent in the reverse direction. The Russian route to Batoum is now open again at the freights previously ruling, i.e., the special increase of 300 per cent, imposed during the Persian-Soviet dispute has been removed. Mr. Palmer said that Persian merchants, probably acting again on instructions from their Government, are refraining as far as possible from using the Russian route at present, as they hope by this means to obtain still further reductions. Such reductions, in my opinion, are unlikely, as the Persians are much more dependent on this route for quick and cheap transport than the Russians are in need of the additional freight. The present rates for carpets from Tabriz to London via Batoum are, according to Mr. Palmer, little more than half those quoted by Douri (for Haim Nathaniel) for transport to London via the Rowanduz route. Some reduction of rates on the Rowanduz route will no doubt become possible as the condition of the road improves, but it is unlikely that they will ever seriously compete with the Russian route, especially as the latter is an all-weathei route. Even if Douri were able in the next year or two to bring down his rates to approximatelv those now charged on the Russian route, rates on the lattei would no doubt be reduced, as the Soviet Government would not lightly relinquish the hold they now have over the Persian transit trade. [915 dd—6] I have, &amp;c. V. A. L. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Rowanduz Route.2 In my opinion, the Kowanduz route can never seriously compete with the Batoum route for the transport of Persian goods to European markets, and vice versa. At best it can only be an auxiliary route for special types of high-valued goods or in case of a recurrence of friction between the Persian Government and the Soviet. The Trebizond route would seem to offer possibilities of greater development—^ as an alternative, once the road has been put into good order, as at least this route leads direct to a Black Sea port, whence goods could be sent by cheap sea freights to Europe. Freight rates on this route would have to be brought down to the level of those charged on the Batoum route, as in normal times goods will naturally be sent by the cheapest routes. As in the case of the Kowanduz road, the Soviets would probably reduce their rates even below economic levels rather than allow any appreciable proportion of the transit trade from Northern Persia to slip out of their grasp. Development of one or both of these road routes could therefore at best be used as a lever to secure better terms from the Russian railways, but it is not likely to supplant the latter. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires suggested that the use of the Rowanduz road by the Russians themselves for transport of their exports through Northern Persia into Iraq and neighbouring countries might be a possibility. This would normally depend to a certain extent on the degree to which the Persians succeed in constructing the proposed road from Resht to Tabriz. It seems to me that the cost of transport across a considerable stretch of Persian land territory, paid for in foreign currency, would considerably handicap Russian trade by this route. Sea freight to Basra would possibly be cheaper even in foreign bottoms, but most Russian exports to Basra are sent in Soviet ships, the majority of the expenses of which are met in paper roubles. Such expenses can scarcely be reckoned as adding considerably to the cost of transport, particularly as the major part would be paid by one Soviet institution, the exporters, to another, the shipping lines.

HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of Tabriz despatch No. 52 of the 19th November on the subject of Rowanduz road traffic. Tehran, December 3, 1932. Enclosure in No. 1. Acting Consul Davis to Mr. Hoare. (No. 52.) Six^ Tabriz, November 19, 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that a steadily increasing number of Persian subjects travelling to Bagdad, Beirut and Constantinople are applying at this consulate for visas for the Rowanduz road. Though this route is as yet but little used for merchandise, it is certainly becoming popular with travellers from Tabriz, who find it very quick, direct and convenient. The closing of the Trebizond road for the winter (vide my immediately preceding despatch) will probably increase the traffic on the Rowanduz road still further, the only competing routes being the expensive and unpopular one through Tiflis and Batoum and the very long detour by Zinjan, Hamadan and Kermanshah. There is, in my opinion, every reason to believe that, as the public realise the advantages of this route and the professional chauffeurs become accustomed to traversing it, a volume of traffic by no means inconsiderable will result. 2. The Russians, fearful of the results which the competition of the Rowanduz road may have on the transit trade via Julfa and Batoum, are already offering merchants considerably increased facilities for the forwarding of goods by that route. At the same time they are using the propaganda weapon against the Rowanduz route, spreading reports that the Iraq section of the road is unsafe and that bands of Kurds are frequently holding up traffic, robbing passengers and looting goods. This consulate is doing all it can to counter these false reports by assuring chauffeurs and intending passengers that the road is perfectly safe on the Iraq side and that they may use it without the least apprehension. 3.

Reference your memo No. E.C.1863 dated 14th March, 1932. The import and export trade between f Iraq and Persia has been fostered and financed for many years by the merchants of Baghdad. The easiest and cheapest route for this business was by the Persian Gulf to Basra, by rail or river to Baghdad, and thence, via Khanaqin, to the main distributing centres of Kermanshah, Hamadan and Tehran. The merchants of Baghdad had their connections in the principal centres of trade of the world and were thus in a position to supply the imports and sell the exports to the best advantage. This position was maintained for many years, to the mutual benefit of both countries, but in recent years other routes to Persia have been developed. Those to and through the northern provinces of Persia have had most influence to the disadvantage of the merchants of Baghdad. The Soviet Government of Russia, which had the advantage of distance and nearness to the source of supplies augmented by a great system of Railways established a hold on the trade of iersia at great advantage to itself and to the disadvantage of Persia. Northern and Western Persian tradeA- @di&gt; trade centres are far from the sources of supply and their fine products are far from their best markets. The Soviet Government traders exploited this position to the fullest possible degree and, by virtue of making large profits in the North and West, were able to compete in the markets ordinarily dealing with Baghdad. Until very recent years Baghdad merchants had only one route for their exports and imports i.e. by the i ort of Basra and the Government of ^raq. greatly improved the facilities of the Port in order to foster this business. The opening of the road across the desert between Baghdad and Damascus was soon recognised by merchants as a route by which high valued goods could be imported and. exported, and it was quickly adopted. The Railway Administration of f Iraq canvassed the markets of Persia for transport of high valued imports and exports, and arranged transport, by rail from Khanaqin to Baghdad and by motor lorry from Baghdad to the Mediterranean, and onward to Europe and .aaerica. The facilities thus provided enabled goods from Persia to reach these markets very quickly and thereby effected considerable saving in bank charges. The possibility of a Railway being constructed between Baghdad and Haifa came under consideration some years ago and has since been pursued with great hopes of a successful issue and, in view of this Railway coming into existence, f Iraq looked for means to extend the benefit which vould result to her trade with Persia. A direct rail connection between Haifa on the West, and Nhanaqin on4, on the East, will be of inestimable value to both ’Iraq and 1 ersia in the trade relations with Central Persia, but it would have little effect in the North and Vest of iersia. f Iraq has an old world trade route between her ri or them Liwa and Azerbaijan. This route was perhaps never suitable for other than pack animal trails ort, and even for that uneconomical means of transport had over long distances fallen into disuse. The ’Iraq Government saw that there would be considerable advantage to her trade with Persia if the Howanduz-Rayat route could be opened for transport by modern means, and, with its intention of constructing a Railway to Erbil and the probability of railway connection with Haifa, realised that this route would become of great importance. A survey of the route was therefore made, and although it was found to be possible to construct a well engineered road capable of carrying fast and heavy traffic it was also seen that the construction would involve the expenditure of a very large sum of money. Undeterred even by this fact and taking the long view, the work was under taken and is now nearing completion. It only requires the co-operation of Persia to maxe the opening of this route of great value now to both countries, and, when the future Hallways are constructed, of much greater value. The produce of the fertile plains and valleys in the North of Persia will by this route reach their markets under conditions of competitive rates for transport that will greatly enhance the return to the farmers and fruit growers in the North West provinces. Samples of the dried fruitfruit from thero were sent some years ago for valuation in the fruit market of Liverpool and the report was that the fruit was first class and had only to be treated and cased suitably to ensure an excellent sale price. The exports of Azerbaijan are principally cotton, carpets, wool, nuts, dried fruit, casings, animals and skins, all high priced articles which find a ready market if the cost of transport is at all reasonable; the imports are also of considerable value. The latest figures of imports and exports available show that the markets of Azerbaijan export goods to the value of Krans 100 , 000,000 and import goods to the value of Krans 64,000,000, per annum. The largest item of export is carpets which is nearly Krans 40 , 000 , 000 , per annum; raisins is next with about Krans 20 , 000,000 and almonds and apricots about Krans 15,000,000 per annum.. Turkey is the largest importer of Azerbaijan goods at Krans 31,000,000, of which Krans 29,000,000 is carpets which of course are re-exported. Germany takes second place and her principal item is raisins, of which she receives nearly Krans 16,000,000 worth. Russia takes Krans 28,000,000, of which sheep and goats, almonds and cotton to the extent of Krans 5 , 000,000 each are the three largest items. The principal items of imports are textiles, sugar, tea and mineral oil. Import of textiles amount to Krans 32,000,000, of which Russia supplies nearly Krans 80,000,000, Italy coming next with Krans 8 , 000 , 000 . Sugar from Russia amounts to nearly Krans 10 , 000,000 and tea from British India at Krans 7,500,000 is the next biggest item. ThereThere There is a great probability that with the facilities offered by transporters of 'Iraq entering into this business, in conjunction with the merchants of Baghdad and Azerbaijan, great advantages will result to both countries irom the opening of the trade route through the lowanduz (Jorge connecting iersia with the markets of the world* A recent innovation has been the introduction of through Bills of lading between European Ports and any destination in Persia. These Bills are negotiable at once and by using them a consignor at a continental port obtains a document covering the carriage of a consignment by sea, rail and road to any town in iersia, thus avoiding the employment of Agents en route, the consignee paying 80$ cash against the Bill of Lading and the balance of 80$, plus charges, on receipt of the goods at final destination. The merchant in Persia therefore knows exactly what his goods will cost him at destination and pays there, and is freed from all charges ana commissions en route, and also from a great deal of correspondence and cost of telegrams, and is saved also the cost of commission on drafts on exchange to various points. These facilities are of the greatest value to the Persian merchant and could be greatly developed by improved trading relations between Persia and 'Iraq. The opening of the Bowanduz-R^yat route from 'Iraq will enable these facilities to be used to a very great extent, and the merchants using them will be free from the almost complete monopoly which now forces them into the hands of Russian agencies for handling the exports and imports of Korthern Persia.There Is a great need for a Trade Treaty between Persia and ^raq which will ensure the same treatment and facilities at 'Iraq points of entry to Persia, as are enjoyed by other countries, both in the North and at kohammerah. At the present time because of the difficulties by the direct route - Khanaqin and through Kasr-i-Shirin - goods from Baghdad for Kemanshah, Hamadan and Tehran are being sent via the ’Iraq Railways to Basra, by river to Iohammerah, and, thence by road to these places, at a very much higher cost of transport than by the direct route.

I haire the honour to report that I duly visited the greater part of the Persian section of the Rawanduz Route', and considered that the whole had been well conceived and executedo Starting from the jetty at Haidarabad In the extreme SoW« corner of Lake Urumiah a chauss^e runs past Nagadeh to a Customs House at Khaneh and then a few kilometres further to the frontier at Rayat. A total of 82 kilometres. 2o The heavy rains have much delayed construction work this year, and getting near the LIYAN Chai (&lt;xt kilometre 63) from Haidarabad, the road was temporarily broken from kilometre 5?£ for a distance of 5|- kilometres and we had to take to a very rough track across fields which ended at the livan Chai bridge at kilometre 62o This bridge is not yet finished and we had to let the oar cross empty and walk over ourselves. Beyond the bridge and between it and the Customs House at Khaneh ( 6 ?|-) the ohauss^e has 2 other short breaks in it - at kilometres 63 and 67„ The breaks at kilometres 57^ and 67 are marked by big stones across the track; as the second at least is dangerous. 3o At Khaneh there is a customs and military post of 35 men under a 2nd Lieutenant. 15 more men are at a forward post * close up to the frontier. This Sir R*H„ Clive, H.CoM.G., etc., etc., etc.. His Britannic Majesty 17 s Legation Teheran.This officer proved obstructive, and at first did not want to let me go any further at all without telephoning for orders to Sauj-Bulaki He then hinted that my luggage strapped on the car possibly contained contraband; and did not want me to approach the frontier unless I unstrapped it all and left it at Khaneho Finally he agreed to let me retain my luggage and proceed, but only on condition that I took one of his soldiers in the car and did not cross the frontier* It proved useless to protest to this officer that it was to the Persian interest that I should see exactly what had been done in construction work, that I had a special recommendation from the Director of the Hoad Department for Azerbaidjan* for this ranker officer had no respect for the Hoad Department or anyone or anything except his Superior Officer at sauj-Bulak and his orders 0 I, therefore a only went on as far as the crest of the last pace, whence a sharp descent led to a small plain with the vil lage of Hayat nestling behind a small hill at the further side of this plain* 5 0 From Khaneh the only real steep ascent in the Persians section starts; and it is a very impressive one indeed* At the crest a walk of about 10 yards enables one to command uninterrupted views up to the Iraq frontier and back over the plain of the Livan Ch&amp;i* 6 * The descent towards the Iraq side is much more gradual than that on the Persian, and there are only 5 acute hair-pin turns; but on the Persian side there are 14 single hair-pins and one double hair-pin while the road about 450 metres in this short stretch of 7,200 metres*7o The curves are wide, however s and well hanked; excepting one stretch of about 600 yards crossed by a small stream in the hand of a narrow curve. This will now he widened and a bridge will be built across this rivulet, 8 , This section and the bridge over the LIVAN Chai should be terminated by this autumn. As said above the exceptional rainfall this year has delayed work considerably, 9, The final stretch up to the frontier, consisting of the last 2 kilometres unmade and 600 yards before that only half made, is being purposely left unfinished in order to fix the exact point of junction of the Iraq and Persian sections in consultation with the Iraq Hoad Engineers, 10o I spent one night at the Hoad Department ? b mud Hut at Nagadeh* Y^here the Deputy Chief of the Rawanduz Road Section and the Haidarabad Harbour-Master also spent the night and we had long discussions, 11 9 Here I saw the new sign-boards prepared for Haidarabad port, which ran:- To Iraq Frontier 83 kilometres To SaujABulak 57 w To Urumiah 65 ' My oar 7 a speedometer (in kilometres) was well in agree ment with the above, and with the sectional plan of the Rawanduz road shown me in this hut, 12, The general idea is that either:- (a). Goods should use the railway from Tabriz to Sharafkhaneh and the steamer from there to Haidarabad; and vice versa, and/or (b). Goods should use lorries from Tabriz to Danalu, and steamer from there to Haidarabad; and vice versa. At present the road to Sharafhkaneh is terrible West of Sofian; and that to Danaiu is very bad much of the way. Route (a)Route (a). Has several objections:* There are at present only 2 trains a week from Tabriz taking 3 hours and 20 minutes: but these are at present in tended to correspond with the steamers for Urumiah (port of Qolmankhaneh)• The steamer goes on to Haidarabad once a week only, and, as a night is lost at Golmankhaneh, the stretch Sharaf khaneh-Haidarabad takes 24 hours* From Urumiah (Golmankhaneh) to Haidarabad by this steamer is 6 hours* Route (b). There is only one steamer a week from Danalu to Haidarabad, but this takes 6 hours only a Tabriz to DanaXu should be possible by car next year in 3 hours* It now needs 5 hours, lake Steamer s:- These are merely small tugs, and passengers and merchandise are embarked on large barges - one or more of which is towed behindo They have holds and ,? eabins T, of a sort* From Golmankhaneh to Urumiah there is a good road, mostly ohauss^e, and the run of 12 miles takes only about half an hour in fine weather. It will thus be see that once a week goods could be sent to and from Iraq via Haidarabad both by Sharafkhaneh and by DanalUc The first route would collect the produce of Ururniah Salmas, Hhoi and Maku and the second that of M&amp;ragha, Mianduab, Sauj-Bulak, Uahnu; and either could collect that of Ardabil and the Mughan* On the first route the steamers also touch at AG CUNBAD a port of the SHAHI promontory, but X could see no local produce or purchasing power there sufficient to interest Iraq or Great Britain in this call* 13, At Urumiah itself hopes are entertained of concentrating all the eventual Rawanduz Traffic upon this town, and the Sharaf- khaneh route* It is true that the surplus produce of Khoi (cereals); of Salmas (cereals and tobacco); and of Maku wool. cottoncotton and cereals would naturally come through Ururaiah in any case and for o artain commodities from these districts and from the Urumlah district itself the Urumiah^Golmanhhaneh road and steamer to Haid&amp;rahad might he a good route in the present poor state of the Urumia-Haidarabad roado X cannot, however, at present see any advantage in this route for Tabriz and beyond* It entails the use of the railway Tabriz-Sharafkhaneh, and the at present slow and round-about steamer services to Haidarabad. The combination of lorry to havalu and steamer from there would therefore seem preferable under present conditions* 14* It is 8 however, clear to me that there are two camps The Urumiah one which desires to utilise the railway and the steamer service at all costs; and the Road department one, which desires to improve the main roads and dispense with uhe transshipments called for if the aid of the steamer and railway services is to be invoked* X confess that 1 feel the latter to be the right idea; as one would not be tied down to a weekly service, and such things as A*P*0«C. or Mosul Kerosene and Benain could be put on a lorry and run without transshipment straight to their Persian destinations - as the Russians now do with their oils from tlulfa* X foresee also a market in Iraq for fresh fruit such as grapes and apricots from Urumiah and Maragha; and a mere weekly service with the further rough handling caused by extra trans shipments would probably prevent the success of any such trade* 15* The JETTIES at the lake ports are rather ramshackle wooden affairs ranging in length from 220 yards at Haidarabad and 220 yards at Golmankhaneh to over 600 yards at Sharafkhaneh* I have not seen that at Danalu* TheseThese piers have been twice increased in length lake-wards in the last 2 years by long additions; - each addition being at a lower level of some 6 or 8 feet than the preceding section s and reached by an inclined plane or even by a ladder. These additions at lower levels have been necessitated by the rapid shrinkage of the lake in 1927-28 and again last year. Following this year’s abnormal rainfall the lake level had 9 however, risen again 20 inches this year up to June 10th, and is still steadily rising. Hails with hand-propelled trucks are installed upon the original shoreward sanctions only, and porterage by hand must again be used upon the longer and much narrower two new lakeward sectionso Embarking and disembarking of both merchandise and pas sengers is a difficult business in winter weather. When approach ing a port the towed barge or barges are oast off and reach the pier-heads partly by acquired impetus and partly by the use of long punting-poles. 16. As the steamer leaves Golmankhaneh for Sharafkhaneh on Tuesdays at 7;30 A.M. I decided to leave Urmia the afternoon before in order to have leisure to make my road-notes etc. I found that there was still no sort of accommodation at Golmankhaneh, and we slept on board the barge alongside the pier - a most uncomfortable arrangement which I should not advise others to imitate. 17. The train from Sharafkhaneh started long after we were able to get away in our car; but the 'road' was so bad as far as Sofian - where it meets the excellent Julfa-Tabriz ohauss^e «* that the train just got to Sofian ahead of us. 18. Dep 6 ts. There is not much dep 6 t accommodation immediately available at any of the three ports visited, but this could of course be easily and speedily remedied. 19.19&lt;&gt; Separate detailed Road Reports will be furnished by me in due course, but the following is a reeumd of what may be consid ered the chief feeders of the Rawanduz Route:- Ao Mahu, via Khoi and Salmas to Urumiah- B. Tabriz via Julfa and Khoi and Salmas to Urumiaho Co Tabriz via Ehoi (direct) and Salmas to Urumiah* As regards A and B. I have so far only traversed the Sal mas -Ur umi ah section; and the small portion of the Julfa-Tabrlz ohauss^e between Sofian and Tabriz, The usual route to Urumiah from Tabriz (excepting the Lake and Railway route described above) is B« There is an excellent chauss^e from Tabriz to Julfa and a very good chaussdie from Julfa to Khoi c X believe the section Khoi-Salmas is not nearly so goodo The section Salmas-Urumiah needs repair upon parts of it: and it includes the long GUSEGHI pass rising to 6000 feet with continual curves and bends* These are not nearly broad enough and are not all of the same width and while the grading and bank ing is good and the surface has been newly repaired on the Salmas side only, no repairs have been made on the Urumiah side and there are often deep ruts on this side - sometimes right in the centre of the curves. In its present state this pass would be dangerous when covered by snow which would both mask the ruts of the surface and might form cornices concealing the edges of the narrow and vary ing tracko C« I am told the direct Ehoi route is execrable; but I propose to see this on my second tour. DoD« Urumiah to Haidarabad. . This is a very bad road in parts, and at one part there is an extensive swamp which it would be difficult to cross soon after heavy rain or when snow was melting. E. Tabriz to Mianduab-Sattjbulafc and Haidarabad. A detailed report on this road will follow B while Mr. Vice Consul Summerhayes has already reported upon it as far as Mianduab. The road calls for extensive repairs: as it is badly rutted and there are mud- holes. I turned off it and stayed one night at Maragha; the by pass road to which is very good and mostly chauss^e. The small by-pass from this road to the port of Danalu has been resurfaced recently and is also in good condition. There is one bad steep descent nearing Sauj-Bulak with narrow and sharp hairpins calling for the use of both hand and foot brakes. I doubt if a long wheel-based lorry could negotiate this easily: but it is short and could easily be improved. Note^- Thene is now no practicable road closer to the southern margin of the Lake than Much of the land shown on the maps in this quarter is really salt marsh or mud flats. F® Ushfru to Nagadeh. I did this the day after a heavy hail and rain storm of 2^ hours following on nearly a week 3 s fine weather. The bar stuck twice in mud having once to be helped out. The plain near Ushbu is inclined to be swampy anyhow s and is traversed by numerous irrigation channels. I turned back at a particularly deep channel 2 miles l. of Ushnu; as I had in any case decided not to enter Ushnu itself for political reasons. &lt;?„&amp; H. The feeders of Tabriz itself: G® from Ahar. H. from Astara via Ardabil. They are both bad and almost impossible in winter. 20c20* On my return here I called upon the Director of Roads 9 and he declared that he did not believe he would attempt a road close around the south shore of the Lake* but would endeavour to improve the existing Mianduab-Sauj Bulak-Haidarabad Sections.

He would also hope to do some work this year or next upon the Urumiah-Haidarabad section. But I gathered that it might be three years or even more before the whole network Tabriz-Maragha-Sauj Bulak-Haidarabad and Hhoi-Salmas-Urumiah-Haidarabad could be placed upon a sound all- weather basis. 21 o A rest house is contemplated at Nagadeh , which* though at present a miserable looking village of mud huts, is in the centre of the fertile SULDUZ district - whereas H&amp;idarabad consists of solely the Earhour-Master 8 s house and a depSt and has no water- supply. There are no villages very near it either. 1 was assured that there is little Malaria in the Suldua* but confess I doubt this as there are abundant irrigation channels and the land is inclined to be swampy and rice is cultivated there. In fact the district must have been a mere mud-bath during all this spring; to judge by its condition following on the 2 ^ hours storm mentioned above. 22 To come to the question of the economic future of the Rawanduz Route. A.

SUGA.R , The distribution of Russian sugar may be said to be escectly the same as for Oils® There are persazneft Branches at Urumiah, Mar&amp;gha &amp; Sauj- Bulak; and the Russian Consul General accompanied by the Director of the Shark Company stayed at this Urumiah Branch on the night of June 20th and went on to Sauj-Bulak on June 21sto At Nagadeh there was only a Tf visiting ,, vendor with small stocks; and X presume this will be the case at Uehnu as at Mianduabo I should add here that there are comparatively few cars based on provincial towns. Maragha. Has 2 public cars; 2 private cars; no lorries; and 2 'garages’ 1 . Sauj-Bu lak. No cars or lorries. 1 'garage'. Urumiah. There are generally 5 or 6 cars and 5 or 6 lorries at disposal in the 3 garages. There are 3 or 4 garages. Actually I hired for 40 krans the private owner-driven car of the son of the Governor of the SU1DUZ to drive me to Golmankhaneh as the cars available in the garages had no speedometeri My chauffeur from Tabriz to Urumiah said that he could do with his new Ford about 100 kilometres (62^- miles) per 4 gallon tin of Benzine upon the Tabriz-Julfa chauaseSe and similar roads; but that upon bad roads such as the Maragha-Mianduab-Sauj Bulak, and Haidarabad-Urumiah sections he averaged about 32 kilometres (20 miles) to a tin: and still less on the Sharafkhaneh-Sofian stretch.I only met two cars, and 3 or 4 lorries used partly to convey passengers on the Tabriz-M&amp;raglia, and Sofian-Tabris sec tions, and one car between UrumiabL and Haidarabad. Oar car was the first this year to try the Uohnu road® In other words the use of a car is rare between Maragha and Urumiah, though more frequent in the northern half of Azer- baidjan* Practically speaking the new Ford is the best-indicated for the bad roads, sharp turns and gradients, and narrow manoeuvring space# Our oar - a new Ford - had already run over 41,000 kilometres (25,000 miles) and we had not the slightest trouble with it (not even a puncture) and we sailed up the Rawanduz climb of 7,200 metres miles) at a gradient of Is 16 in exactly 15 minuteaS In estimating the possibility of competition in kerosene etc. it must be remembered that the Russians are always prepared to make sacrifices in order to retain their grip of a marketo A recent instance was quoted to me while I was on this tour where the Russians had paid 16 krans a pud freight to Ramadan for their sugar and yet sold this at Ramadan for 65 krans a pud when the orIce was round about 78 krans at Tabriz» In the face of competition one would expect to see the Russians drop their prices at all of their distributing cen tres near the Rawanduz Route. Bitumen . The Director of Roads gave me confidentially to under stand that he would like to try crude Bituminous products from Mosul on parts of his roads, whij-e prepared Asphalt would be too expensive. Other Imports. The total value of Imports from Great Britain into Azerbaidjan by all routes was only a little over one million krans in both 1930-31 nnd 1929-30; but presumablypresumably this volume might be increased both in cuantity of goods actually established on the market and by the addition of new ranges which cannot transit Russia and which the delays of the Trebizond route discourage Importers to order* British India imported just under eight million krans (chief ly tea) in 1930-31 and nearly twelve million krans the year before* I visited thoroughly the Bazaars of Maragha, Sauj-Bulak and Urumiah and found them very poor indeed* There was no display of gold ornaments in the Jewellers 8 booths;, no large stocks of carpets or other valuable native manufactures, no sign of any native indus tries* Without very substantial advances in native purchasing power and Standard of living there seemed no field anywhere for British manufactured articles, but mostly for cheap continental articles* B* Exports* It is from the encouragement to and opportunity offered for the export of native agricultural produce and I ex pect the main initial success of the Rawanduz Route. Maragha is centre of a district of 300 villages, all irrigated by a network of miniature canals from the SOEI river; which district paid 420,000 tomans in taxes last year* Cereals and of course grapes and raisins are the chief products but some cotton is pro duced and this latter and cereals could be increased. The Mianduab diotrict grows much cotton, though this year the crops were entirely destroyed by hail on June 2nd. There are also quantities of raisins and cereals* The Souj-Bulak plain grows tobacco, as also do its dependent districts of Mangour, Mamish and lahijan. k little wool also comes from the tobacco districts. Nagadeh, Rnhdunu and the SUIPUZ district produce rice,tobacco,* and cereals* The Ushnu valley produces tobacco, wool and cereals. I feel sure ricerice could be grown here also, Urumiah . Has 4 main districts producing raisins,, last year 300 waggon-loads were produced and all except 7 have been soldo Note :- A waggon-load is estimated at from 700-900 puds according to the form of packing and degree of compression of the raisins. This year 4 * of the crops were destroyed by hail early in June, which broke the tendrils, Almonds in quantities and some rice is grown. An experiment with 200 puds of cotton seeds is being made this year. The Russians sold 100 puds of this at 3 krans per pcud on condition that the crop be resold to Russia at one kran below the market rate. Tobacco is grown around Urumiah itself and in the Targavar and Margavar districts, Wool is also produced in large quantities in the same districts as the tobacco and also at Dasht, Salmas. Tobacco and cereals; and wool from SOMAI &amp; BRADOST, Khoi Chiefly produces cereals, Maku Chiefly produces cotton and wool . Tabriz Produces Almonds at Dehkhargan and the Sharafkhaneh district, Sharafkhaneh. Almonds and cotton in the Gunei districts. Ax dab 11 and the lySughan produce wool in the Shahsavan zones: cotton in the Bilasevar zone. Or to give the above ranged under commodities:- Almonds Shaxafkhaneh district, and the Dehkhargan and Govgan districts of Tabriz and Uxumiah. Ururaiah produced 5000 puds last year. Apricots.

Wool, Maku, Salmas (The Samai &amp; Bredost districts), Ushnu., Urifiniafe (The Targavar, Margavar and Dast districts) 0 B’rom the Urumiah and Ushnu districts together 14,000 puds of wool and 2,000 puds of larab*s wool called GUZAM was produced last year. Much also comes from the Shahsavan tribes of the Mughan and the Ardabil districto A little from Sauj~Bulak province (Mangour, Mamish and lahijan districts) 0 Potential fer tility and Population , The main point, however, is that there are vast stretches of fertile soil, or of potential rice-fields lying unproductive. Villages are dotted like islands in vast seas of plains. There appears to be enough water ready to hand, but not enough population nor incentive to increase production© Taxation. As there is no ready market for surplus cereals and fruits and any attempt at exportation is subjected wo the strangle-hold of Russia, peasants incur a dead loss if they produce more than they can be certain of selling - for if the price drop through over production the taxes by weight remain the same© Such taxes may even be arbitrarily increased oy s, uc i-T^ advised or unscrupulous local Authority© in%la the case of Ururaiah raisins for instance a chance of se curing not merely a temporary hut a permanent market was offered when the Smyrna crops failed last year 0 The Urumiah Authority, however, vested in one person as the Governor is also Reis Beledieh* He chose this moment to impose an additional tax of 1 leran a pud on raisins and maintained this tax until all except 7 waggon-loads of raisins had been sold, des pite a telegram of protest to Teheran and a reply from the Ururaiah deputy that this tax was irregular» Each transaction still entails the payment of a Municipal Tax of 4 shahis per pud by both vendor and purchasers, Similarly the Tobacco Monopoly has increased the tobacco tax from 8 fcrans per sagat batman to IS;with the result that less to bacco is being planted at Urumiah and elsewhere this year than usually. At Urumiah this Governor said to me that the peasants were unwilling to plant the usual second seasonal crops - TS as they said that they could find no market for them 11 . I had, however, noticed many newly ploughed fields from Maragha to Sauj-Bulak, and I naturally wondered if lack of a ready market or fear of new arbitrary impositions were the real cause of this apparent apathy at Urumiah. While this particular individual hats such dual autocratic powers in Uxumiah, it might be regrettable that Urumiah be made the centre of the Rawanduz Route traffic© The clear decrease of population in recent years is very marked. The reasons would seem to be:- ( a ) The ravages of war and their consequences : Urumiah and its district was sacked ir 1918-19 first by the Assyrians and Armenian Levies; then by the Turks. The native moslems seized this opportunity to pillage and even massacre the resident ChristiansChristians&lt;&gt; The Catholic and .Russian ivlissions were gorapleteily destroyed as well as most of the Christian suburbs of Uruudah end the present central nucleus of the town is still surrounded by the remains of devastated Christian suburbs,, Every possible obstructionist method to prevent the return of Christians to Urumiah is adopted by the present Governor &amp; Their title-heeds are declared to be out of date or forgeries,, and their vacant sites are stld for the '’Benefit of the Munici pality” . Last year on two occasions arrests were made on trumpery charges of local Europeanised Assyrians; but this was before the arrival of the actual Governor, So that the discouragement of Christians must be a deliberate policy, which in the absence of a French or British Consulate Governors of Urumiah can carry out with impunityo ill this does not ma&amp;e for the assured prosperity of this one important section of A^erbaidjano S ubsidiary hlsasters 0 The disastrous earthquake of last year reduced the population of the Salmas plain by about 60/L Here an enlightened course has been pursued, and as Salmas now depends direct from Tabriz and no longer from Uruadah it will no doubt recover slowly, Hew sites have been given free, EOOeOOC tomans was distributed in relief and there will be no taxes till 1935 or 1936, (©) SXMKO » Wherever I passed on the West side of the Lake 1 saw traces of cr heard of the disastrous raids of SIMKO. Hagadeh itself following his raids had been reduced from 1000 families to 215 only: and the: STJLIXJZ had suffered severely, Talu, H-'idarabad and many adjoining villages had been abandoned and fallen into ruins. These are merely two capital points of the Hawanduz Route, butbut there are eeores of villages in other quarters which have neve completely recovered from the raids and exactions of Sin&amp;o and hie mem It is to he hoped for the future of the Rawanduz Route that his mantle has not fallen upon the shoulders of the young son of Xhurdish Aghs - the chief of the Harki* This tribe ranges between Iraq and Turkey in winter, and the Ushnu hills in summer Their migration is often accompanied by 'incidents'. Two years ago they attacked Ushnu at night and pillaged it, while last year Khurdish Agha supported Simko in his demands; and the death of both of them (even if they were treated in a treacherous manner, as is sometimes alleged} at Ushnu probably saved that section of the Province from renewed pillage* The 'settled' Kurds are represented to me as being quite satisfied with the existing regime, probably they are, as they have a stake in the country,, While those of the Urumiah Governorate are not called upon to furnish conscripts, those of Sau^=Bulak and Ushnu districts do so. All retain and carry their rifles, and seem ready upon these terms to aid the Government to repel raiders who might start by pillaging their own fields and huts* With an assurance of something approaching order and an intelligent Economic Policy I quite agree with the many persons, starting with the Governor of Urumiah himself, who declared that the Saujbulak Sulduz, Ushnu, Urumiah and Salmas districts could produce five times what they did in 1929-30o I need not labour the obvious economic truth cf the reper cussion of material prosperity upon the numbers of the populatioj (and vice versa); but besides this slow but automatic increase c: population probably other settlers would be speedily attracted t a zone which had a regular trade with Iraq and boasted its own outlet to the Mediter ranean via Iraq, Benefits3?

Bu t - from remarks dropped during discussions I concluded that it would be futile to count upon sentimental considerations weighing for anything in this purely commercial undertaking* When I to marked to one Authority that I had had an enquiry for raisins from a firm in India e he at once said ^Ohp but we can send tuese via Mohammer ah'. He hastily added that of course the route was long and perhaps would be more expensive than via Bawanduz and Basrah, Another personage said that he could not understand why freight rates from Mohammerah were so high, and, when I pointed out that the Suez Canal dues were very high, clearly showed that he was more interested in the possibilities of the EisiDin- AlexandrettaAlexaQdretta route than in the possible JSrbil-Bagdad-Haifa railway route* At present there is some hope expressed of shaking off the thraldom of Russia 0 but I candidly doubt whether such enthusiasm or patriotism would long resist the acid tests of an all-round reduction of Russian freight rates* a little better general treat ment over trade exchanges* and a slightly enhanced respect for commercial agreements on the part of the RussianSo A few weeks of all three improvements combined would probab ly suffice to again swing the tide of trade along the old channel; but* of course, the actual strangle-hold would have to be permanent- J ly removed as any new relapse on the part of Russia might well divert trade the Iraq way again - and this time permanently . Russia has, however, the ”adVcntage' 1 of maintaining a |j battalion of propagandists - paid or volunteers under commercial obligations - throughout this town and the whole Province* Trebizond Route;- Nothing much is heard of this route at present* lj I hope to have more to say ©3T it after visit to Khoi and Ma*.u in August* The Turkish Consulate General dis played an almost embarrassingly open interest in my recent tour* The Turkish Consul General did not proceed in this direction this year himself as he had intended; but his son Sureya Bey who, as already reported, hoped to obtain a transport concession for the Treoizond route left Tabriz for Urumiah and 'Sauj=B^luk T5 on June 25th - two days after I returned* Cther Political Aspects; The Russian Consul General came to Urumiah via M&amp;ku and Khoi on June 21st and left Urumiah for Sauj=»Baluk on June 22nd 0 At Nagadeh I was told on the morning of June 17th that the latter * s visit there was anticipated and that orders had been given not to allow him to visit the route West of Nagadeh* Later the same day a road-guard rather theatrically and quite unnecessarilyf, unneoesearily stopped nay oar on the way baolc from Nagadeh to Haidarabad and declared he had orders to loo]£ out for the Russian Consul General. Similarly at Urumiah the Governorj when returning rpy call on June 21st, said that the Russian Consul General had probably arrived there and he could not see why he should want to see the Rawanduz Route 0 As I had no other indications whatever that my Russian Colleague had in fact wanted to do more than maice a round of his Russian Trade Organisations, I could not regard these spontaneous declarations - coupled as they were with the concrete ^QQt that obstructionism had been shown to me by the military at £k a fleh on June 16th - as more than a confirmation of the usual Persian dislike for Foreign Consuls to stir far outside the limits of their town of residence. All my Colleagues, however, appeared decided to tour in the same direction this year and two have already started,, The Turks have a Consulate de 2e Classe at Urumiah, and the new Consul Jemal Bey used to be a Chief of Section in the Angora Foreign Office. He came here from Mitylene. He appeared very friendly, and I gathered that his life at Urumiah was not very pleasant just now* The Russian Consulate at Urumiah was suppressed last year 0 Distributions: As this report forms a corollary to my report 29 C to the Commercial Secretary upon the trade carried by the Julfa-Tabriz railway, I am sending copy to the Department of Overseas Trade and Bagdad.

'*• oieoueeea the plans which he has lormec for the develop ment of the Persian export trade as a result of his recent investigations in urope# 2. He has reached, ag was almost inevitable, the twofold conclusion 1) that to extend the market for ^rsian produce abroad the cost of inland transport must be sensibly reduced and 2) that the quality of that produce, as well as methods of grading and packing, must be consider ably improved. X do not propose enumerating his ideas in the latter regard. It steads to reason that cultivation must be supervised by exports and that foreign technicians will have to be employed for the purpose, in view of the absence of local talent. Colonel ^acCormaek is trying to induce ^reek families, expelled by the Turks and acquainted with the packing of fruit, to come to Persia, d. His scheme for the immediate development of internal ooiananleations is more interesting. It comports;- a) A law lor the appropriation of se ven million Tomans of the Hugur and Tea Monopoly Funa for pur oses of road construct ion. The 'Shefagh-i- Surkh' of October IBth, it may be noted, estimated etat 6,81^,066 Tomans or £l # 262,7v0 at to-oay'e rate of exchange $54 Krane to the t sterling) the amount that has accumulated in that Fund up to date. 1 aehod Colonel MnesCormaek whether he thought each a law would paaa the kajlia, the jealousy of the latter, where the application of the Monopoly Fund ia concerned, ueing well-known. He said he felt little anxiety on this account ae he hao elaborated a echeme 'which would please ©very section of the country'. b) Two millioni of the seven million Xom&amp;nB appropriated {or borrowed) from the Monopoly fund to be devoted to the construction of a railway, presumably a light railway, from the ’Iraq frontier at ^uraitu to the foot of the Paitek Pees, end of a rope railway to facilitate the carriage of t code over th© paae. Colonel MacGormack took it for granted that 'Iraq Bailwaye would continue their line to th© frontier point in the event of this project materialising* I asked whether this did not entail the establishment of a dual frontier post, the nedd for which had been urged for many years* I was told that the Persian authorities were now agreed among themselves of the necessity for this innovation and that there was no reason why the dual customs post should not materialise in the near future 'as long as the Persian and ’Ira^i customs officers were kept irom mixing together'• I expressed the hop© that this did not mean that •oods would have to be examined in two distinct buildings* Colonel MscCormack's reply was not very reassuring although he said that everything would be done to occasion as little anoyance&amp;jLM0jr*i*»e© ttoa delay poe^ible to travellers* a) The h&amp;eteain^ of the worh on the Isswauidsu H#«d # 4) The reeonetrustioa of the tfuaGep-Meshed road, lor vrftich at le&amp;st 400*0u0 Tojssijis ?oulo 1 e&gt;# r^^uired* Meshed1 merchants ere very anxious to develop their trade sith India and to organise rsotor transport services for pssa^ngors and poods oeteeen Meshed and railhead at Dusdeb* Danish, a powerful Persian nerehant of Meshed, la at present nepotl&amp;tlnp with the An^lo^Perslen Oil company for their agency in 8*st Persia* he hor&gt;ee to be able to hrisg patrol the whole way fres Busdny to ^oahea in sU-wheeled tank lorries ead compete with the aussisas all sleaf the line* Asssft reoeatly opened an agency in hirjead* I enqp ired shethar the j»s&amp; 1 for extend* tn$ the rsllssy to Sist&amp;a had been abanaoned# x wss given to undorstend that it abandoned* Major Hftn f e feUm&amp;te* Colonel moCortm** said, h&amp;u been based on the erroneous assumption that mils could be laid on the desert without &amp; solid foundation being mad© for them* Colonel Morris, the now American Director general of •oeda, reckoned that the coat of building a beesavllle as Ussy between buaesp end Meshed would be in the neighbourhood of 4&amp; aiilion tomans* ?hs cost of constructing a lio$ from ihisdep to Siston only woulc still bo prohibitive unoer exist ing financial eircumatenees* b* Colonel M^oCorasaok dealt some length on the opportunities which would be gives ‘Iraq to develop its transit tradetr? ue with rei sia* The tiovernment of ’Iraq must however raeot hlia halt way* He hoped to conclude eora© form oj transport agreement with ’Iraq railways before lon^.

Dr. Millspaugh has just returned from Tabriz, where he has been with Minister of Public Works, and called immediately to tell me that he is wholly in favour of constructing Persian section of the road for motor traffic, is anxious to begin as soon as ever an understanding can be reached with Irak, and has a credit of 100,000 tomans available which he will allot to the purpose, and which is estimated cost of construction. He says that no reliable computation of volume of merchandise to travel along new route can be made, but that Tabriz merchants are keen on it, and say they would send by it everything which they now send to Constantinople, which they estimate at 50 per cent, of total exports of Azerbaijan. Principal articles of export are carpets, intestines and dried fruits. What procedure do you suggest? Do you think anyone need go from here to Bagdad to discuss matter? Do you consider that road engineers from either side should meet at frontier to ensure proper junction of two sections of road ? Persian section will pass east and south of lake. As regards trial caravan to Saojbulagh, Dr. Millspaugh thinks there will be no difficulty in finding back*load, and is favourable to idea. He will consult Tabriz merchants, and asks whether they could be placed in direct communication with anyone in Bagdad. He also enquires probable size of caravan. Enclosure 2 in No. 1, .. ^ _ r . Sir P. Loraine to Sir H. Dobbs {Bagdad). (j\0. loO.) Tehran, June 1, 1926. ’ I HAVE the honour to acquaint your Excellency, with reference to my telegram No. 74 of the 31st May, with the upshot of the conversation which I had yesterday afternoon with Dr. Millspaugh, on his return from Tabriz the previous day. 2. It was most agreeable to find that Dr. Millspaugh, whose visit to Tabriz had coincided with that of the Minister for Public Works, was imbued with the keenest interest in the projected route and a firm resolve to have it created with the least possible delay; I might say, indeed, that I have never previously seen Dr. Millspaugh so positively enthusiastic about a project. He told me to begin with that he rather doubted obtaining a satisfactory result through the usual channels of the Persian Government—this, of course, was said in personal confidence—but he gave his personal assurance that he would do everything in his power to push the matter rapidly through. He told me that he had been much impressed by the attitude of the Tabriz merchants generally; they had been badly hit by the Russian embargo and by the unfair practices of the Russian State trading [1321 x—5]2 organisations, but they were bearing their bad days with fortitude and their patriotism seemed perfectly sound. They were irritated by the new sales tax in Turkey, for 50 per cent, of the whole trade of Azerbaijan passed through Constanti nople, and complained of vexatious delays on the Trebizond caravan route; he had found them unprepared to formulate their difficulties and grievances in a clear or concise manner, but singularly reasonable in the statement thereof, which he eventually extracted. They considered that the new route from Azerbaijan to Irak, would be an excellent thing, and when asked by Dr. Millspaugh what proportion o^ s their trade via Constantinople could be sent in future by Irak, they replied that they were quite willing to send the whole of it and cut out Constantinople altogether. 3. Dr. Millspaugh had called for approximate estimates for the creation of communications between Tabriz and the Irak frontier on the Rowanduz Road. Four estimates had been handed in :— (1.) 2 million tomans for a standard railway. (2.) 1-| millions tomans for a light railway. (3.) 800,000 or 900,000 tomans for a horse-drawn tramway line. (4.) 100,000 tomans for a motor road passing to the east and south of Lake Urumia. Dr. Millspaugh felt that the construction of a good motor road would meet all present and immediately forcgable requirements. He had available a credit of 100,000 tomans, which he could immediately devote to the construction of the motor road, and he promised the Tabriz merchants so to allot it, provided that an under standing could be reached with the Government of Irak for the completion of the Irak section of the road. What he wanted to ascertain from me was where matters stood as regards Irak, what guarantees the Irak Government required in order to put in hand the construction of their section of the road, and how soon it would be possible to get down to business. I told Dr. Millspaugh that the Irak Government were not going to make political considerations in connection with the failure of Persia to recognise Irak an obstacle to the construction of a mutually beneficial trade route, and that they merely wished to know whether the Persian Government were really serious in their desire to create it. Dr. Millspaugh said that he could give me that assurance as from himself straight away. I told him that I had informed the Persian Government officially of the attitude of the Irak Government, and gave him to read, to his obvious satisfaction, a copy of my note to the Persian Government No. 133 of the 24th May, copies of which are enclosed herewith. I also informed him that your Excellency was willing for your part to take up the matter energetically with the Irak Government as soon as the necessary assurances had been received in regard to the intentions of the Persian Government. 4. At this, also, Dr. Millspaugh expressed the liveliest satisfaction. 5. Dr. Millspaugh's next enquiry was how best to set about the matter. He wished to know whether, in your opinion, any direct conversations between Persia and Irak would be necessary, and said that he himself would, if indispensable, be willing to go to Bagdad to discuss the matter or send a representative of his own choice. He thought, however, in view of my explanations in regard to the attitude of Irak, that this might be superfluous. He said that one point which would evidently require careful attention was the proper linking up on the frontier of the two sections of the road, and he therefore made the suggestion that engineers from either side might be directed to meet at the frontier and make the necessary arrangements for this purpose. 6. Dr. Millspaugh stated clearly that, in his opinion, the creation of this trade route was beneficial from every aspect, and he was very much attracted by the possibilities of a through route from Azerbaijan to Bagdad, which, so far as he knew, had never before existed. He dwelt on the general and particular economic advantages, general, in so far as the creation of a new trade route was concerned; particular, in so far as the new route would help to deliver the Azerbaijan traders from the dependence on Russia and Turkey, whose yoke they had found so irksome, die also considered that the project offered distinct political advantages. 7. Lastly, I explained to Dr. Millspaugh the idea which you had put forward of sending a trial caravan to Saojbulagh, providing that a return load could be guaranteed. The details of his observations in this regard have already been furnished to you in my telegram under reference, and there is no need to enlarge upon them here. 8. I shall await with great interest your reply to mv telegram and, if there are no difficulties of a grave kind to be overcome in Irak, I think the project can be put3 rapidly through, and that the construction of the Persian sector of the road will be begun as soon as definite assurances from the Irak Government as regards their side of the frontier are forthcoming. 9. Copies of this despatch are being forwarded to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to the Government of India, and to His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz. , I have, &amp;c. PERCY LORAINE. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. » Sir P. Loraine to Sir Davood Khan Meftah. M. le Ministre, Tehran, May 24, 1926. I HAVE the honour to inform your Excellency that on learning of the interest taken by the Persian Government in the improvement of the trade route leading from Azerbaijan to the northern districts of Irak by way of Ryat and Rowanduz, I caused immediate enquiry to be made of the Irak Government as to how far they would for their part be able to co-operate in such a scheme. I considered that in the interests of both countries it was desirable, before any decision was come to or any expenditure incurred, to ascertain whether agreement on the principles of the project did, in fact, exist between the two Governments. It appeared clear to me that such a scheme would scarcely be practicable unless pursued with equal energy on both sides of the frontier; it appeared unlikely that one country w T ould expend money on the improvement of the trade route unless reasonably assured that a corresponding effort would be undertaken by its neighbour. His Excellency the High Commissioner for Irak has now replied to my enquiry, and I am authorised to convey to your Excellency a formal assurance that the Irak Government for their part are prepared, in so far as the financial situation of the country permits, to co-operate with the Persian Government in the establishment of a rapid and permanent trade route between Azerbaijan and Irak. They regret the obstacle that has been put in the way of friendly discussions of this nature by the continued inability of the Persian Government officially to recognise the Irak Govern ment, but they are nevertheless willing to do their best to minimise any delay which may arise owing to this cause. I should be very much obliged if your Excellency could see fit to communicate this assurance to the proper quarters; and I need scarcely add that, if a corresponding assurance on the part of the Persian Government is forthcoming, the chances of an early materialisation of the project would be considerably increased. I avail, &amp;c. PERCY LORAINE.HXTRaCT from Koonomic Reports tioCr,F.313/26.) 236. Trodf with Por»l^ (Reference paragraph 228). The British Minister in Tehran has suggested that it would be best to defer the comzunioation to the Persian Government of the Iraq Government’s promise of co-operation in regard to the opening of the Azerbaijan trade route, as he hopes by this means to impress upon the Persian Government the advisability of early recognition of the Iraq Govern ment. The Acting High Commissioner has telegraphed his concurrence* In the meantime, the Council of Vinistere have' agreed that steps be tasen to construct a motor road from Arbi! to the frontier through Rswandus. The Ministry of Comnunications and /orks while unable to give an estimate of the cost of this work until a rated survey has been completed, have asked the Ministry of Finance to rake a special budget allotment of Rs 2# lakhs for the purpose. Of this sum they estimate that approximately Re. 40,000 will be required for the two bridges, the necessity for which was pointed out in paragraph 210 (a); the Ministry desire to place the order for these bridges as early as possible. The Ministry of Finance do not. however.agree that the time is yet ripe for such a substantial allotment of funds, and the Acting High Commissioner supports this view. He has rointed out that he has received no further definite indications of the intentions of the Persian Government and that, in the present financial situation, the Iraq Government cannot afford to begin the construction of a motor road until it is assured that the intentions of the Persian Government are serious. He has recoronended nevertheless that the following measures be undertaken if the money can be found. (1) temporary improvement of the existing track (2) bridges (3) survey of the route.Jff- The AdministratiTe Inspector let Arbil has put forward proposals for an alternatire route to the trontder for road construction which he maintains will tap a larger area in the hill district that that at present contemplated* A copy of ' Persian Commercial itatistioe for the year 1303', received from the Tehran negation has been supplied to the Council of Ministers.

Co.^M.g.g.U^L D.G. No. P.O. 36. The Residency, Baghdad, 22nd February, 1926. My dear Prime Minister, His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran has recently addressed me in a matter which may prove to be of great importance to ’Iraq in the near future. 2. It appears that the Persian Government have been, for some time past, considerably exercised over the question of their Azerbaijan trade. Not only is traffic with Turkey, between Tabriz and Trebizond, liable to constant delay and interruptions, but the road is a loig and difficult one. Of greater importance is the fact that Russia has recently placed an embargo on all imports from Persia except cotton. This embargo may last for years or months, or may be removed immediately, but it has at any rate thoroughly frightened the Persian Government, who are now exceedingly anxious to open a trade route from Azerbaijan to 'Iraq. Even if the embargo were to be removed inr/iediately, it must be borne in mind that the balance of trade with Persia is adverse to Russia, and that it will always be to the interest of the latter to restrict imports from Persia. Persia fully realises this and is desirous of securing an outlet from Azerbaijan that will leave her independent of Russia. The inmediate step that she proposes to take is the construction of a Decauville line from Sherafkhaneh along the eawtem and southern shores of Lake Urumia, via Sauj Bulagh to the 'Iraq frontier near Rayat. I under stand that a railway embankment, constructed by the RussiansRussians during the war, already exists over a portion of this route, and that Persian intentions are serious is evinced by the fact that the Majlis have granted an appropriation of 5~0,000 tomans to facilitate exports from the northern and eastern provinces. 3. The opening of a rapid trade route between Azerbaijan and Baghdad via Rawanduz and Arbil will not only be of general benefit to the finances of ’Iraq but will'also have a great effect upon the security and prosperity of what has hitherto been one of the more backward districts of ’Iraqi Kurdistan. 1 suggest, therefore, that the Ministries concerned should take immediate steps to effect such minor improvements in the route as are capable of early execution, and to formulate proposals for the construction of a motor road from Arbil to tho frontier near Rayat. I understand that the security of this route is at present good, but the possibility that a largely increased volume of traffic may need greater protection than at present exists should not be lost sight of. I have enquired from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran as to the nature and volume of the export trade from Azerbaijan, and will not fail to keep you fully supplied with all information that I may receive. 4. In this connection I wish to touch briefly upon the whole question of ’Iraq transit trade with I ersia. Your excellency is doubtless aware of the extent to which the finances of ’Iraq depend upon this trade; they must continue so to depend for many years, until the internal resources of this country can be more fully developed, in discussing their programme of railway development, the Persian Government have until recently shown a disquieting tendency Utendency to ignore the desirability of a connection with f Iraq via Kermanehah. The bill which was recently r-v presented to the Majlis included a programme for eight railway lines, in which a line to the ’Iraq frontier via Kennanshah did not find a place. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister informs me that, when the bill was discussed in the Majlis, a very large number of deputies insisted vigorously upon the importance of this line, and that the law as finally passed did not contain any I programme at all. The result is that the Persian Government are not, as 1 feared would be the case, | committed to a prograunae excluding the Kermanshah line. This development is a pleasing indication that the Persian people realise, to a greater extent than was previously believed, the importance to them of a railway connection with ’Iraq. 5, I have recently discussed with Mr. Vernon the possibility of abolishing the half per cent transit duty. The possibility that the legality of these dues may be challenged under the Freedom of transit Statute has already been pointed out in my letter No. P.0. 20 dated the 21st January, 1926. Quite apart from this, 1 believe that the existence of this duty is not only obnoxious to the Persian Goverrraent but is to a certain extent restrictive of transit trade. Mr. Vernon does not consider that it is at present possible to abolish the duty, but I am by no means convinced that it will not be possible in the near future. The duty at present produces about 5£ lakhs of rupees per annum, and I believe that the loss attendant upon its abolition would be partly made up, in an indirect fashion, by an increase in the trade. It might also be possible slightly to iissrease through railway freights, and the possibility of /-' ■ n the talking over by the Customs Department of all bonded warehouseswarehouses, and of a slight increase in bonded warehouse dues, might also be considered. I believe these sugges tions to be of importance and hope that consideration will be given to them in due course. 6. To revert to the main subject of this letter, 1 suggest that the Council should authorise me to inform the Persian Government, through his Britannic Majesty f s Minister at Tehran, that the ’Iraq Government are prepared, in so far as their financial situation permits, to co-operate with the Persian Government in the estab lishment of a rapid and permanent trade route between Azerbaijan and ’Iraq. They regret the obstacle that has been put in the way of friendly discussions of this nature by the continued failure of the Persian Government to recognise the 'Iraq Government otficially, but they will, for their part, do their best to minimise any delay which may arise owing to this cause. I have already informed Your Excellency, in another connection, that 1 have urged Sir Percy Loraine to take this opportunity of urging upon the Persian Government the necessity of recognising the ’Iraq Govern ment, am it appears to me a suitable opportunity for the ’Iraq Government, while displaying a friendly attitude, to make a dignified reference to the subject. 7. I am sending a cox&gt;y of this letter to the Ministries of Finance, Conmunications k Works and the intei'ior, and to the Rais of the Royal Diwan. Tours sincerely, (Signed) B. H. Bourdillon. His Excellency ’Abdul Munsin Beg al Sa’dun, President of the Council of Ministers, Baghdad.Copy. ECONOMIC IMPORT NO.50 . Attached to Intelligence Summary No.4 dated the 18th February 1926. 210# with Persia . (Reference para.208). (a) felegrama have been exchanged with the British Minister at Teheran in regard to the proposed opening of a trade route between Azerbaijan and *Iraq, viz. the road from Tabriz to Abril and Kirkuk. It appears that, in consequence of the virtual closure of the Russian and Turkish irontifirs to Persian goods, a serious congestion oi exportable articles exists in Azerbaijan; and that the situation has suggested to the Persian Government the possibility &lt;*f a permanent outlet from Azerbaijan which it* independent both of Russia and of Turkey. The matter is receiving careful consideration from the ♦Iraq Ministries concerned who are fully alive to its importance especially in view of the recent extension of the •Iraq Railway system to Kirkuk. As regards the condition of the road in *Iraq territory, there is a motor road from Kirkuk to Arbil and from Arbil to Dera (20 miles) on the way to Rawanduz is passable for motors. It is reported that the stretch of 33 miles from Dera to Rawanduz was used for wheel transport during the war. The road fi'om Rawanduz by way of Rayat to the Persian frontier at Zinu ohaikh ^ 39 milee) is now open to pack transport and is carrying in perfect safety a small export trade from ’Iraq. ~&gt;o far as pack transport is concerned it is passable except for short periods dependent on weather conditions when the rivers Chomakir and Rawanduz Chai, which have to be crossed between Dergala and Rezan, cannot be forded. For wheeled traffic, apart from general improvements to the road, bridges will have to be constructed at these points: thethe sites have already been inspected by the Public Works Department but the spans are considered too great for construction with local materials and the two bridges will take time and money to build. It is, however, nown that Russian cars came at least part of the way from Zinu Shaikh to Rawandus during the war.\ It should, therefore, be quite feasible to construct a road for carts. As regards the Persian side of the frontier, the Persian Government talk of an extension of the Decauville railway from Sharaf Khanih on the north shore of Lake Urmia to Sanj Bulagh or the frontier. It seems that a railway embankment was built by the Russians for this purpose during the war and is still in existence. The 'Iraq Government are prepared to assure the safety of their aection of the road. The British Minister at Teheran has been requested to supply information as to the main classes of exoort and a rough estimate of the volume of trade anticipated. It seems from Persian Customs statistics that one of the most important former exports is that of carpets to Constantinople by way of Khoi and Trebizond. It is said that, thou^i the Khoi route is passable for motors, goods are still normally carried by caravan, the journey taking between one and two months over a distance of about 600 miles. With a railway to the Persian frontier on the Rawanduz goode would have to be carried by road only 160 miles to railhead at Kirkuk. (b) (Reference para. 204). In connection with the Persian gmin shortage, the Persian authorities have decided that motor transport up to !•£• tons capacity will not be commandeered in future; also that animal transport now entering Persia will not be called upon to carry more than 30$ grain; and that motor transport of whatever capacity now entering Persia will be free.- *•.
