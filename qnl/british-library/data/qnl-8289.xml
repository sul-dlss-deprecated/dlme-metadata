He also requested to see detailed accounts of all moneys paid in relation to rites and alms;The late Maharana's mothers belief that her son was murdered through witchcraft and her wish to see those she believed responsible brought to justice. Colonel Wright responded that the original letter containing the accusation of witchcraft had been proved by the Colonel to be a forgery and had been corroborated by Baidha Rao and that the British Government viewed accusations of witchcraft dimly and would put them down with a 'strong hand'.The letter concludes with a discussion of the power that the Maharaja's mother formerly had and difficulties in attempting to continue to be involved in administrative affairs.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023694719.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
