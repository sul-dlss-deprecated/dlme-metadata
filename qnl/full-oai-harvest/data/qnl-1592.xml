                           Lapwing; Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah, ruler of Bahrain; and the
                           kaymakam(Ottoman governor) of al-Qaṭīf.These correspondence concern the murder in 1900 of Salmān bin Di‘aj Āl Khalīfah, cousin of Shaikh ‘Īsá, together with some twenty-five others, at the hands of the ‘Behaih’ section of the Āl Murrah tribe while on their annual hawking trip on the mainland of Eastern Arabia at al-Darayah, some thirty to forty miles south of al-Qaṭīf.The file contains details of the murder itself (folio 7), as well as subsequent dealings with Turkish officials and the Āl Thānī family in order to avert revenge attacks (‘blood feud’) by the Āl Khalīfah family (for example, folio 45) between 1902 and 1906. There are incidental references to the outbreak of plague in the Gulf in 1903 (folio 76).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Homicide</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002fb#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002fb#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
