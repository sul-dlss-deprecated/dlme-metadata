The documents include an assessment of Shaikh Isa bin Ali's rule and discuss the rationale behind the appointment of an Agent to the island as well as the logistics and price involved in doing so. The correspondence is primarily between the Political Resident in Bushire and the Government of India.Later documents, from 1904, discuss the need for the Agent to assume more responsibility and the Political Resident's desire to appoint an officer of the graded-list to the post. The volume also contains documents from 1907/8 related to the practicalities of using the Political Agent's boat against pirates in the area.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>National Economy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Religious conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rights of states</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arab nationalism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Social reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00012f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00012f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
