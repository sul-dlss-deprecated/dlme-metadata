His claim is against the late Hilal bin Ramazan (also referred to as Hilal bin Ramadhan al Shumais) of Debai [Dubai] for non-payment of dates sold to him in 1932 or earlier. The correspondence is mainly between the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Residency Agent, Sharjah who investigate and report on the progress of the claim. Included in the correspondence is a petition from the claimant Ahmad Gharibi to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and a letter in Arabic and English from the Residency Agent to Yusuf bin Nasir, the judicial receiver at Sharjah responsible for administering the estate of the deceased Hilal bin Ramzan. Letters between the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Residency Agent, Sharjah are also in Arabic and English.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Debt recovery</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Debai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00025d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00025d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
