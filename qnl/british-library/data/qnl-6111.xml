There was no mention anywhere of Imperial Airways having to pay duty on oil and petrol imported for thfeir use i.e. dram by their aircraft. Please see Kuwait 'Civil Air Agreement' on page 152 file VI/10. Petrol and oil imported by H.M.G. for civil aircraft is exempted of customs duty (para 15 of agmt.) £ 500 are provided annually to compensate H.E. for the privileges given by him to H.M.G. in respect °f civil aviation. It is also stated that a further sum representing the Customs duty on petrol and oil for refuelling of the civil aircraft other than the I. Airways, (they being exempt/, will be paid by H.M.G. to the Shaikh, ipara 16 of the agreementl. As no civil aeroplanes (except Imperial Airways) visited Kuwait during 1934-35 no question of payment of duty on petrol and oil arose. Now P.R. thinks that the sum of £ 500 p.a. for all the privileges enjoyed by the Imperial Airways is not an adequate compensation to the Rule^ and before any representation is made by the latter he suggests that H.M.G. provide some sort of compensatory payment in lieoof the exemption of duty or ask the Imperial Airways to pay Customs duty on jdaaix petrol and oil they import for Ttse of their aircraft at the rate of 5$ ad valorem.

(Sd.) H. A. RUMBOLD&gt;.L lilDlA Oi i: FIGE v i HI IEHALL, S . Vf. 1. P.Z. 5028/35. 2nd August, 1935. Sir ^ I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the express letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf dated 2nd July, of which a copy was forwarded to the Air Ministry on the 26th July, No.P.2. 5028/35, on the subject of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement. Lord Zetland feels that there is a clear case in equity for re-examining the effect of the exemption from customs duty granted by the Sultan of Muscat (and the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit) in respect of petrol and oil imported into Muscat for the use of Imperial Airways. It is obvious that none of these Rulers could have appreciated, at the time when the agreements were concluded, the extent of the revenue which they would lose by this concession. Both for this reason and in view oi the desirability of retaining the confidence and good wall of the rulers concerned, His Lordship trusts that the proposals of the Political Resident will receive the sympathetic consideration of the Air Council, whose views he would be glad to learn at an early date. Copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am etc., (Sd.) M.J.CLAUSON. he Secret ary Air Ministry. 'is.32956 II/D-13-C.A, AIR MINISTRY, LC1TO01T, W.C.2. 31st August, 1935. I Sir , I am directed by the Secretary of State for Air to refer to India Office letter of the 2nd August, Ro.P.Z.5028/ 35, in regard to the exemption frcm Customs duty of petrol and oil imported into Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit, for the use of Imperial Airways, Ltd. 2. I am to request you to inform the Secretary of State for India that Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister concurs in the view that there is a case for re-examining the effect of the Civil Air Agreements with the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit. 3. It seems to Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, however, that if the concession proposed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is made in the form suggested by him, it will be extremely difficult to avoid continuing it on the same basis in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme. This would, of course, involve much larger payments than those now in question. With five services a week; instead of two, and having regard to the heavier type of aircraft to be used, the liability would be trebled, anc would thus in each case amount to £750 per annum in addition to the annual rental of £500 paid to each of the three Rulers. 4. It is not considered that this Department should be committed to payment of more than £250 a year in each case, especially having regard to the pressure which is being applied to the Governments of Iraq, Palestine and Egypt to give remission in full in connection with the Empire Air/ ae Under Secretary of State, Political Department , India Office, S.W.l. t0 2 . Air Mail Scheme. It is suggested therefore that, in all three cases, petiol and oil should he exempted from Customs and other duties a payment heing made not exceeding £250 per annum to each Ruler, in part compensation, although it should he clearly provided that this payment will he the maxim um v;hatever the actual consumption of petrol and oil may he. . - ^ •• •— It seems essential to make it clear that the agreement will cover the extended frequency of services visualised in 1937 onwards. 6. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister presumes that if this suggestion commends itself to Lord Zetland there would he no difficulty in securing an amendment of the current Civil Air Agreements or, alternatively, in negotiating fresh agreements, say, for a period of five years from 1st January 1936. **&gt;*1011 7. It seems preferable that a similar arrangement for the payment of this 'compensation ,, should, if possible, he made in all three cases. The present procedure in Muscat, under which the Sultan is called upon to make a substantial disbursement annually, tends to focus his discontent. 8. The object which the Political Agent has in view would in this manner he equally well achieved, as each Ruler wouldhenefit to the extent of £250 per annum. On the other hand, excessive liability for Air Funds in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme would he avoided. 9. in regard to refundment of duties under the current Muscat Agreement, I am to forward herewith a copy of a letter dated 21st August from Imperial Airways Limited. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister will he glad to he furnished with any observations that Lord Zetland may wish to offer with reference to the second paragraph. 10.

I am directed to refer to the information given by the Air Ministry to my Company on the 28th December 1934 to the effect that the Sultan of Muscat had agreed to grant exemption from fuel duties in respect of deliveries of fuel at G-wadur to my Company’s aircraft with retrospective effect to the date of agreement, namely 25th October 1934.

Please furnish your views by post as soon as possible whether the present arrangements regarding the payment of customs duty on petrol and oil imported for Imperial Airways should be changed and if so how this should be done. 3. Do you consider that a lump sum payment of the £250/- proposed by the Air Ministry, or if, say, £500/- a year (in addition to the annual rental of £500/~ a year) would be likely to be accept able to the Ruler as perpetual compensation for loss of duty on fuel used by Imperial Airways irrespective of possible further expansions of the Company^ service? s. 6 .

Reference your confidential ISxpress Letter Iio762-S, dated the 26th September 1935. 2. As Imperial Airways have now doubled their services to and from the Bast, and are likely shortly to expand further, I am of opinion that the Shaikh should get something more than the £.500/- per annum now paid to him - In other words I agree with the contents of the Political Resident's Express Letter No.459-3, dated 2nd July 1935, to Secretary of State for India. 3. As regards the best method of doing this, I gsa of opinion that we should give the Shaikh a further ’'lump sum' annually (over and above the £.500/- which is now paid by the Air Ministry into his account with Lloyds Bank, London). 4. As regards amount to be given: If it is the intention to renew the Civil Air agreement for another period of five years from 1st January 1936 (See para 6 of Air Ministry's letter No. 3.32956 II/DDCA, dated 31st august 19 35) then I think it would be sufficient to offer the Shaikh an extra £.2dfo/~ P^r annum, as proposed by the Air Ministry, and then to reconsider the question of further compensation at the end of that period - This sum to beThis sum to bs paid retrospectively frcm 1st January 1935 (Vide para 10 of Political Resident's letter No.459-S of 2nd July 1935 ) as this would obviouly be the only fair thing to do. 5. If on the other hand the increased subsidy is to be in the nature of ' a perpetual compensation ” for loss of duty on fuel used by Imperial Airways, irrespective of all future expansions of the Company's service, then I think we could ask the Shaikh to accept nothing less than £.500/- per annum. 6 . Vhatever sum is eventually decided upon however, I am strongly of opinion that Kuwait and Bahrain should receive exactly similar amounts, as any attempt to differentiate between them would be resented and would defeat the object we are anxious to attain. 7. I naturally have not discussed the matter at all with the Shaikh, but curiously enough since his return from England he has hinted that with the expansion of Airways services, he trusted he would get an increased compensatory allowance, showing I think that he is watching events* 1 8 * I give below the information called for in para 5 of your letter under reference: (a) Quantity of petrol provided for the use of Imperial Airways in •••• ••«. •••• •••• 24r4:80 Gallons• -ditto- librieating oil -do- .... 77 Gallons.

I had therefore suggested that it should fee accepted as a principle that the sum of €.500 paid at present to the Balers should fee regarded only as considerstion for the privileges under A, and that the Civil Air Agreements should be rmended so as to provide for the payment of customs duty on all petrol and oil imported for the use of Imperial Airways. 4. It is now generally agreed that the Eulers in question have a clear case in equity for a re-examination of the effect cC the existing Civil Air^ Agreements (vide paragraph 2 of Air Ministry letter Mo. 8 .32956 Jl/b. 0 .a*A., dated the 31st August 1935). the Air Ministry, however, are averse from making a concession in the form suggested fey me, i.e. payment of customs du » &amp;8 ** *ould fee difficult to avoid continuing it 0 n the same tests in connection with the Empire Air ^ail Scheme, and h»ve suggested (vide paragraph 5 of their let er quoted afeove) that privilege B should fee compensated for fey an annual payment of £.250 to each Buler in addition to the annual payment of £•500 for the privileges accorded under A, it feeing made de*r that /th»t the addition*! payment would cower the extended frequeno of services visualised in 193? and a nw^rds. 5. X am still of opinion that the simplest and most satisfactory way to deal with B is for customs duty to tee paid on the actual amount imported. If f however, the objections to this proposal cm the part of the Air Ministry are very strong, the only alternative is to fix a lump cum to tee paid annually in lieu of customs duty. But in equity to the Rulers this sum should have some relation to the actual amount of duty the filler surrenders. I do not know, for instance, ©n what teas is the Air Ministry suggested the sum of £.250. hen the lump sum of £.500 to cover teoth A and B was fixed the service had only recently been transferred to the Arab route, and it was difficult to arrive st any reliable data. The service has now been running on the Arab Coast for over three years and figures of the importation of fuel for aircraft on the basis of a weekly service ©an doubt less be supplied by Imperial Airways, If this consumption is multiplied by five this would give a rough approximation •f the f tl consumption when the service is expanded to its ^ ximom, i # s # a t five services a week, in 193?. the customs duty on fuel at Kuwait and Bahrain is that at Muscat is 1Q^» but in order to bring the Sultan of Muscat into line with the Rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain the duty at Muscat may regarded a# feeing 51 for the purposes of assessing the annuel payment under B (vide paragraph 9 of my Express letter q ©tad above)* with these factors as a basis it should fee possible to arrive at a lump sum which would not only fee fair te the Ruler, but would fee based ©n a principle which would be /-j&amp;SSi. 10 P a ■ »4~ te ret'dily un ^ era to od by him* 6 . The present CiTil Air Agreements are due to aspire in 1958, 1 r&amp;eomnmd that the eyetem proposed in ay preceding paragraph should be applied as follows. The financial clause of the OiTil Air Agreement should be modified so that the sum of £*500 paid at present for A and B is allocated to A only from the date on which Imperial Airways service was duplicated, i.e, 1st J&amp;nwry of this year. Similarly, the sum th t is finally fixed for B should be allocated for that purpose from the same date* the actual sum paid to be 0 n a sliding scale corresponding with the increases of services, 7, 1 hare for the sake of clearness considered the allocation of these sums under the separate headings of A and 3, If, however, it is not desired from the point of view of the Air Ministry to draw attention to the fact that a separate sum is actually being p* id ©n account of B, doubtless the revised financial clause could be so worded as to include payments ua er both heads in one figure* 8 , with reference to paragraph 7 of the Air Ministry letter quoted above. If the proposal in my paragraphs 5 and 6 above is adopted i think it would be possible to induce the Sultan of Muscat to agree t© non-payment of customs duty in the first instance instead of the present system of a refund. 9, It is, of course, not intended that the payment for B proposed in ay paragraphs 5 and 6 above should cover customs duty on fuel and oil imported by Imperial Airways for the use of aircraft other than their own, the question of which is treated / P• 5- / b &gt; treated separately under the Agreement* 10* In concluaion 2 must point out thr^t the presumption in paragraph 6 of the Air Minietry letter quoted abore is not likely to be borne out by facte. Xhe Euler* in question are already becoming concerned at the present increase of the Imperial Airways Services so far ec it affects the financial term# of their Agreement* f and will certainly prove diffieult when it cornea to an agreement covering e further increase in these services unless they receive what they consider to be adequate compensation. •d, f.C.Fowls, hi eut.-Col Uriel* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Fernandez, Imperial airways agent. 3. as the matter is somewhat complicated, I would like to make the following tEro points clear before proceeding further. (a) That Mr. Yusuf al Gbanim works f cr the xi.I.O.C. purely on commission agency basis, that is to say, he disposes of the consignments of petrol, oil, ana other bye-products received from xvbudan purely on his principals 1 account, remitting them the sale proceeds of same less his agency commission, rrices, both retail and wholesale, are dictated by ^badan. lb) That duty on petrol iaviation spirit included) oil, etc. is levied in kind and not in cash. This may be due to the fact that the local Customs Dept t. have no means to know the cost of such consignments (short of asking the A.I.Q.C., Abadan to furnish same), since consignments are received and disposed of on consignor ’ s account . 4. To come to the question of petrol and oil supplied to Imperial airways: The system of accounting at present obtaining is as under:- The pilot of every machine refuelling here signs the a.I.G.C. agent, a receipt (in quintupli cate) for tie amount of fuel taken from the latter, who forwards a copy of the receipt (in duplicate) to Abadan and another copy to the local x*gent of Imperial Airways. The Imperial Airways Agent in turn forwards his copy of the receipt to xJ?ea manager, Cairo, and so on. The amounts are finally adjusted, it seems,2 -r ^ it seeras, by the London Head offices of the two Companies concerned. It will therefore be seen that the whole matter of customs exemption enjoyed by Imperial Airways at Kuwait resolves itself into one of mere book a dj ustme nt s between ii. 1.0. C. and Imperial airways Head Offices in London. 5• As regards the allegation made by Imperial airways that their fuel requirements had been drawn from duty paid stocks, -the position is as under: The * 1 . 1 . 0 .C. agent tells me that from 10th April 1035 onwards all supplies of aviation fuel have been allowed to enter duty free by the local Customs Deptt., also that on the above date 99 tins of petrol were refunded to him, which represented amount of duty levied from 1st January to 13th April 1935. This in effect means that Imperial Airways fuel supplies have been coming duty free as from 1.1.35. The Agent further tells me that he took care to inform his principals at ^badan of all this at the time. You will therefore see that so far as the period from 1.1.35. to cate is concerned the local Customs have done the right thing and so no rebate is due from them for this period. It was up to the *i.I.0.L. to allow Imperial Airways a corresponding reduction pf price with effect from 1.1.35. in a adjustii^g cost against the latter Company, .us to why this has not been done is a question which the ...I.O.c. must answer. 6. There then remains the period from 23rd May 1934(date of -agreement) to 31st December 1934 to be accounted for. I understand that owing to sheer inadvertence on the part of local Customs Deptt. supplies received over this period weresub jected to usual amount of duty. H.L. the ohaikh will of course readily rectify this error of his Customs Department by causing to be refunded the amount of duty soo - duty so -ee collected. But 1 must here remark that in actual practice, this question of refund is not so easy of execution as it appears at first sight, since • the Customs Deptt most probably have long disposed of the quantities of petrol collected as duty over the above period. The only alternative therefore would be for the ohaikh to ascertain from the Customs records the total amount of such duty, work out its cost at the rate then current^ere, and refund it to the A.I.O.C. agent who could advise his principals of the refund and ask them to make the necessary adjustment in their account with Imperial airways. 6. as regards para 4 of Bushire letter under reference, re working out some sort of an arrangement for future adjustments: ^s will be clear from what has gone above, the Imperial Airways agent has nothing to do with the adjustments, nor also the A.I.O.C. agent. The Customs Deptt. will, as hitherto, continue to allow all aviation fuel is duty free. The whole thing therefore rests with the ^.I.O.C. who should in adjusting cost of fuel supplied by their ^gent, give Imperial airways the benefit of the concession granted them by the local Government. 7. ninee writing abo\Ze I have received a note from the x^.I.O.C. agent, which slightly alters * para^above. The note is attached herewith and I shall be glad to explain it personally.35 ' Translation of a letter No.R-4/2318 dated the 19th Ramadhan 1354, corresponding to the 15th December 1935 from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After compliments. In reply to your letter No.0352, dated the 14th December 1935, I have pleasure in informin g you that no custom duties have been levied in Kuwait on the quantity of aviation petrol and oil imported into Kuwait during the year 1935. As for the 99-40 tins you mentions ed, 99 tins were already restored to the Company's agent, Ahmad al-Ghanim; while 40 tins by an oversight at our benzine stores % at the Customs House were not restored, and no infiding was made about them at the time. Accordingly I have now ordered the Customs Departj^ment to restore the same at once to the abovementioned agent. Usual ending. AS'E A P H E b S L E T T P H . Prom* To* Political Agent, Kuwait.

Civil Air Agreement - Right of Imperial airways to exemption from duty on petrol and oil imported for their aircraft. f Reference your Express Letter No.895-S, dated the 27th November 19 35. 8* I have seen both Ar.Yusuf al Ghanim, A.I.O.C’s local agent, and Mr .Fernandez, Imperial Airways agent about this subject and with the following results, but should before proceeding further like to make the following two points clear. (a) Mr.Yusuf al Ghanira works for the A.I.O.C. purely on commission agency basis, that is to say, he disposes of the consignments of petrol, oil, and other byevpro&amp;ucts received from ^badan purely on his principals’ account, remitting them the sale proceeds of same less his agency commission. Prices, both retail and wholesale, are dictated by ^b&amp;dan. (b) Duty on petrol (aviation spirit included) oil, etc., is levied locally in kind and not in cash. This probably is due to the fact that the local Customs Departraent have no means to know the cost of such consignments (short of asking the A.I.O.C., Abadan to furnishfurnish same), since consignments are received and disposed of on consignor’s account. 4. To come to the question of petrol and oil supplied to Imperial Airways: The system of accounting at present obtaining is as under The pilot of every machine refuelling here signs the A.I.O.C. agent, a receipt (in quintuplicate) for the amount of fuel taken from the latter, who forwards a copy of the receipt (in duplicate) to Abadan and another copy to the local Agent of Imperial Airways. The Imperial airways agent in turn forwards his copy of the receipt to area Manager, Cairo, and so on. The amounts are finally adjusted, it seems, by the London Head Offices of the two Companies concerned. It will therefor© be seen that the whole matter of customs exemption enjoyed by Imperial Airways at Kuwait resolves itself into one of mere book adjustments between A.X.O.G. and Imperial Airways Head Offices in London. \ j 5 . As regards the allegation mace by Imperial Airways (vide their letter No.ARI2/WOC/66, dated 3rd October 1935 to the Secretary, Air Ministry) that their fuel retirements had been drawn frcm duty paid stocks, the position is as under: The A. 1 .0.G• agent tells me that from 13th April 19 35 onwards all supplies of aviation fuel have been allowed to enter duty free by the local Customs Department, also that on the above and a subsequent date a total number of 139 tins of petrol was refunded to him, which represented amount of duty levied from 1st Janoary to 13th April 1933. This in effect means that Imperial Airways fuel supplies have been coming in duty free as from 1st January 1935. You will therefore see that so far as the period from 1st January 19 35 to date is concerned the local Customs have done the right thing and so no rebate is due from them for this period. It was up to the A.I.O.C. to allow Imperial Airways a corresponding reduction of price with effect from 1st January 19 35 in adjusting costcost against the latter Company, to why this has not been done is a question which the a.I.G.C. must answer. (date of Civil Air Agreement} to Gist December 1934 (8 months) to be accounted f or. i under stand that owing to inadvertence on the part of local Customs Department supplies received over this period were subjected to usual amount of duty. This possibly also may have been aue to the fact that the Air Ministry did not credit the ^haihl^s account in London with the £.500 agreed upon fur 1934 ti±l January 25th, 193b. His Excellency the bhaikh will of course readily rectify this error of his Customs Department by causing to be refunded the amount of duty so collected, and I am addressing him to this effect. But I feel bound to remark that in actual practice, this question of refund is not so easy of execution as it appears at first sight, since the Customs Department most probably have long disposed of the quantities of petrol collected as duty over the above period. The only alternative therefore would be for the Shaikh to ascertain from the Customs records the total amount of such duty, work out its cost at the rate then current here, and refund it to the A.X.C.C. agent who could advise his principals of the refund, and ask them to make the necessary adjustment in their account with Imperial Airways • 7. As regards para 4 of your letter under reference, re working out some sort of an arrangement for future adjustments: As will be clear from what has gone above, the Imperial airways agent has nothing to do with the adjustments, noi also the A.I.O.C. agent* The Customs Department will, as hitherto, continue to allow all aviation fuel to com© in duty free. The whole thing therefore rests with the A.I.O.C., who should in adjusting cost of fuel supplied by their agent, give Imperial Airways the benefit of the concession granted them by i r the local Government. ia) 6 There then remains the period from 23rd May 19 G #4 Lt.-Colonel, l olit i cal Agent , Kuwait.f 784A INDIA OFFICE, POLITICAL Department.

I am directed by the Secretary of State for Air to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that Imperial Airways Limited desire to obtain permission to land one of their aircraft at Koweit, Bahrein and Gwadur in cannection with a flight which they propose to carry out from London to Karachi and return. 2. The aircraft to be used is Vickers 'Velon” aeroplane G-aBKY, registered in the name of Imperial Airways, Ltd. 3. The landings will be made on or about the 18th December on the eastbound service and on the 19th December on the westbound service. 4. In accordance with the terms of the agreements entered into with the Sultan of Muscat, and the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, special authorisations for landings at Gwadur, Bahrein and Koweit, respectively, will be required. 5. I am, therefore, to request that, subject to the concurrence of Lora Zetland, the necessary instructions m the matter may he given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 6. a copy of this letfer has been sent to the Foreign Ofxice. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) C.H. BHIGSTOCKE e Under'-Secretary of State, India Office, S . W . 1.P.Z. 8744/35. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 23rd December, 1935. Sir, I am directed the Secretary of State for India to /' refer to Air Ministry letter of 31st August, No. S. 329562/D.D.C.A. regarding the Bahrein, Koweit ant Muscat Civil Air Agreements. 2. The Marquess of Zetland notes that Lord Swinton concurs in his view regarding the desirability of revising the financial provisions of these Agreements; but as regards the form which this revision should take he ? /$■ would invite attention to the Political Resident s / 3 Express Letter of 27th November, 1935, No. 894-S./1935, a copy of which was forwarded to the Air Ministry under India Office printed letter of 9th December, No. P. Z. 8744/35. 3. Lord Zetland agrees generally with the views expressed by Colonel Fowle; in particular he feels that the compensatory payment should bear a close relation to the amount of duty which the Rulers actually surrender, and should not be limited to an arbitrary figure such as £250 which can hardly fail to be regarded by the Rulers as quite inadequate when the Empire Air Mail service is instituted. He is therefore inclined to favour Colonel Fowle’s first suggestion, i.e. that the sum paid annually to the Rulers should be equal to a 5 per cent, customs duty paid on the actual amount ox i'uel imported in that year. 4. if, however, this proposal is unacceptaole to the Air Council on account of the unfortunate repei cussions which it might have on negotiations in respect of he Secretary, Air Ministry, S.W.l.other territories in the Middle East, His Lordship would readily consider some arrangement wherebya lump sum would be paid annually to the Rulers, which would have no overt connection with the exemption from duty, though in fact based roughly on the amount of fuel consumed. Existing figures for the importation of fuel for the use of Imperial Airways are no doubt available to the Air Council and would serve as a basis for calculating this sum, which would increase in proportion to the amount of fuel actually imported. For instance, a sum representing roughly the value of the ^resent exemption would be appropriate until the commencement of the Empire Air Mail, and a proportionately increased sum thereafter. 5. as Colonel Powle foresees no difficulty in bringing the existing procedure in Muscat into uniformity with the procedure proposed for Bahrein and Koweit, it has been assumed in this letter that his proposals would apply to all three States. 6. His Lordship does not propose at this stage to suggest the actual alterations to Clauses 15 and 16 of the Koweit and Bahrein and Clauses 15 and 17 of the Muscat Heads of Agreement, which it would,be necessary to make in order to give effect to his proposals. But there would be no difficulty in doing this once agreement has been reached on the form and amount of the payment which is to be made. 7. i am therefore to enquire whether the Air Council are prepared to reconsider the matter with a view to achieving an early settlement on the general lines suggested above, the details of which can be arranged byinter-departmental discussion. 8.

Will you please/refer to your express letter of 27tii November 3 I\ T o.894-’-S of 1935 and oonnected correspondence about the possibility of revising the financial clauses of nistrj the ICoweit, Bahrein and Muscat Civil Air Agreements. I now ”F9th yMth ~ enclose a copy of a letter from the Air Ministry upon which ures we shall be glad to receive your views. 2. The figures attached to the Air Ministry letter show clearly the value of the exemptions from petrol and oil duties ? and Y^e hoy; at last have all the cards on the table. You will see that if the increased payments to the Rulers were strictly based on the estimated increase in consumption, they Y/ould probably be larger than those now proposed. On - the other hand we feel that there is considerable force in the argument (r/hich the Air Ministry very strongly urged in interdepartmental discussion) that Y/ere the Rulers to observe the nov 7 recognised international practice of granting snant-Colonel T.C. Roy/le, C.B.E. , Consul General, Bushire.drawback* their claims to compensation would disappear, vfe suggest * therefore* chat the present proposals put forward by the Air Ministry* which constitute a substantial advance on their previous proposals* are worth syrnpao i^etic cons icier a cion ano. that it is nr ob ab i v not too much to expect the rulers to tie themselves down 101 7 peais in i eturn -l or tne financial advantages 'which they v;ould derive. ine j_ inaneial oeneiits which will accrue to the o. rulers undei each 01 ohe tw r o alternatives suggested by the xii Ministry seem to be nicely balanced., It seems unlikely that the endurance of aeroplanes will increase to such an extent within the next 7 years that it will be possible to dispense with the present stopping places* so it appears that alternative (b) is almost as safe an arrangement as alternative (a). In either case it would be necessary to revise articles 16 and 17 of the Civil Air Agreements as well as article 15 in the case of Muscat* as it is clearly essential that the Sultan of Muscat should agree to non™ payment of customs duty in the first instance. The choice oe tween the two alternatives appears* therefore* primarily to depend upon which will be the easier to negotiate.(b) might from this point of view be preferable, as it is based on a simple and logical principle^ moreover the figure of £150 per weekly flight compares favourably with the present actual value of the exemption at Bahrein (£230 for tv/o flights) and appears to be almost exactly the present value at Muscat if calculated on a 54 basis (£597 at 10yo). 4. As you will see Treasury authority has to be obtained before the rulers can be approached, so we should be grateful for your comments as soon as possible. 5. Could you please also look into the case of the claims for refund at Gwadur mentioned in India Office letters of 22nd October, 1935, and 5th March, 1936. 6 . I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to Metcalfe, Loch, Watts and de Gaury.2956 (Part II) F. II, Sir, AIE MINISTRY, LONDON, W. 0.2. 9th April, 1936. I am directed by the Secretary of state for Air to refer to your letter of the 23rd December last, P. Z.8744/35, regarding the question of the revision of the Bahrein, Koweit and Muscat Civil Air Agreements, to subsequent semi official correspondence, and to the meeting between repre sentatives of the India Office and Air Ministry on the 13th. ult imo. J Yfhile, as stated in this Department’s letter of the 31st August last, S. 32956/ll/D.D.CoAo , Lord Swinton agrees that in view of the increased use of the landing grounds and the still further use which will be made under the Empire Air Mail Scheme, some increase in the annual paynents to the rulers of Bahrein and Muscat is justified, he is very reluctant to agree that such increase should be directly related to the quantities of oil fuel imported into these states ±or the purpose of refuelling the machines. I am to enclose a copy of a statement furnished by Imperial Airways shewing the present annual imports of petrol and oil and the duty charged, together with estimates of the corresponding figures 'when the Empire Air Mail Scheme is in operation. The Company point out that the figures are given with some reserve as they understand that further debits are to be received for the 6 months ended 30th September, 1935, suppliers having charged incorrect amounts. Under-Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office,; irtfcl It is now a recognised international practice to grant exemption from Customs or other duties in respect of fuel and oil taken on board for the purpose of operating machines to places outside the territory in which the stock is maintained, and where duty has already been paid, a Customs drawback is granted in respect of any quantities of oil and petrol supplied to aircraft for use in such cir c urnst anc e s. If, therefore, the rulers of these tv/o States conformed to international practice, the complaint as to the. apparent loss of customs revenue owing to the operation of the exemption clause in the civil air agreements, Y/ould disappear. Lord Swinton also desires to point out that, apart from the advantages which will accrue to the territories by the establishment of the civil air routes, the continued maintenance of such a route through these territories facilitates the passage of military aircraft in emergency, which is an essential requirement if His Majesty 1 s Government are to be enabled to come to the assistance of these rulers in time of emergency. In these circumstances Lord Swinton would prefer to base the increased rentals at Bahrein and Gwadar on the general increase in use by Imperial Airways of the facilities provided and would be prepared to seek Treasury authority for either of the following alternatives (a) He?/ Agreements for 7 years at an increased rental of £ 1,000 a year with retrospective effect to the date when the service was duplicated, viz: 1st January, 1935, covering the privileges enumerated under ’A 1 and U B TT of the Political Resident's Express LetterJ W 894/s of 27 tli November last. or (b) to revise the existing agreements to provide for their continuance for a further period of 7 years with an increased payment of £150 a year in respect of each additional service undertaken by Imperial Airways over and above the first service covered by the payment of £500 a year under the original agreement. I am accordingly to suggest that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be informed of the foregoing views and be asked to consider the possibility of negotiating agreements with the rulers of Bahrein and Muscat on one or other of the bases suggested in substitution for the existing agreements which are not due to expire until the 6 th June, 1938, and 25th October, 1938, respectively. Colonel Fowle will no doubt point out to the rulers concerned that under the first alternative they would receive a guaranteed annual amount, irrespective of the number of services in operation, whilst under the latter arrangement, there is a possibility of variation in the amounts payable, as in the event of an improvement in the endurance of machines employed on this route, landings at one of the intermediate stopping places might be rendered unnecessary. It is assumed that in view of the increased payments offered under either alternative, the Sultan of Muscat would agree to non-payment of Customs duty in the first instance, instead of the present unfortunate system of a quarterly refund. With regard to Koweit, I am to explain that this landing ground is not scheduled as a regular stopping place under the Empire Air Mail Scheme and it will only be used on special occasions or in emergency. Lord Swinton does not consider, therefore, that any reason exists for an increase4. in the annual payment of £500 to the ruler. A copy of a letter dated 5th March, 1936, which has beenr eceived from Imperial Airways, Ltd. with regard to the difficulty which is being experienced by the Company in obtaining refund of duty on petrol and oil uplifted at Gwadar from 26th October, 1934, to 31st December, 1935, is also attached, and I am to request that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may be asked to take such action as is possible with a view to obtaining the refund of duties in accordance with the Civil Air Agreement.

I am to refer to our letter of the L2nd October, 1935, a reply. In case our original letter has been mislaid, I attach a copy for your information. Paragraph 9 of your letter of the 8 th July, 1935, reference S.32956/D.D.C. states:- n The Sultan has agreed that whilst all oil and petrol for the use of aircraft, other than Royal Air Force aircraft, will be subject to the importation duties in force, he will refund quarterly the duties collected on all oil and fuel that may have been actually issued for the exclusive use of your Company, such amounts being certified by the agents appointed as suppliers by His Majesty’s Government. In this connection I am to inform you that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, through their agents at Gwadar, have been appointed as suppliers by His Majesty’s Government for this purpose.” I am now informed by our Cairo Office that in accordance with the above, claims amounting in all to about £650 for refund of duty on petrol and oil uplifted at Gwadar from 26th October, 1934 to 31st December 1935 have been submitted quarterly to the Director of Customs, Gwadar. All such claims have been rejected, and it appears evident that both the Director of Customs, Gwadar, and the Director of Revenue, Muscat, are unaware of the terms of the agreement betv/een the Sultan and His Majesty’s Government. I am to request you therefore to advise us as soon as possible what steps we should now take to recover the duties paid on the petrol and oil in question. rexerence 7955, to which we have not yet received JL CU lil j vL u w • For and on behalf of IMPERIAL AIRWAYS LTD.

If the report from the Captain of ’’Satyrus' is satisfactory, Imperial Airways have the intention of following this survey flight up by two return experimental flights during August with flying boats of the new '‘Empire* or 'C' class type. If the reports from these Captains are also satisfactory, Imperial Airways have in mind replacing one of the present land plane services as far as Karachi by a flying boat service carrying, of course, sur-charged mail and not “all-up” mail. You may think it desirable to pass this information on to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf so that he can warn the Sheikhs along the route. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

Persian GvIf, and from the Political Resident to the Political Agent? we have now heard from Imperial Airways that all their own landplanes operating through the Persian Gulf are in possession of the necessary permits.

Dear Gihson, I mentioned to you over the telephone this morning services with flying boats and landplanes to cope with the additional mails during the Christmas season. The flying boats are of the normal type but the landplanes have been collected from various sources and comprise such types as result that the remaining aircraft, or at least some of them, have not the requisite permits to operate through the completed their arrangements which, indeed, are still subject to modification from day to day. They hoped cnat the Royal nir Force would be able to assist them curing the is strictly limited. V/e regret that the Company have not had time to abnormal circumstances the omission will be overlooked You may perhaps wish to acquaint the Political Resident leaving it to his discretion whether the matter should be broached to the Sheiks or not. I should mention that the additional services have that Imperial Airways were operating numerous supplementary Engigns, Frobishers, Hannibals, ^talantas, D.H.86’s, Dragon Rapides and possibly Curtis Condors. Only Hannibals and ^talantas have been operating on the regular twice weekly landnlane service between Alexandria and Calcutta with the Persian Gulf. It was only recently that Imperial Airways obtain permits for all their aircraft and hope that in the J.P.Gibson, Esq., India Office,ITT CONFIDENTIAL. No. W) Duplicate .
