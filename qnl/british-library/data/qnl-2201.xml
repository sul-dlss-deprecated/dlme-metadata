When harain aingh went to India he was allowed bail in 6,000 'tomans. He overstayed (through no fault of his own) his time and was arrested on return. who was in the employment of Oardar Jagat bingh, son of Haisahib Jowaia dingh aeeeasea, was dismissed by his employer lor some reason or other at the instiga tion of Cheth Singh, the partner of Wagat Singh. In revenge Oulab uingh came to Tehran and in formed the Public Prosecutor that in connexion with Tarain Singh’s bribery case Sheth Singh had told him, -ulab &gt;ingh, tc bribe the Persian director of Customs (mentioned ad&lt; ve), not to proceed with the charge of sns uggling. The result is that now Che th oingh is also in prison on this charge. Nanak Singh, Narain Singh’s driver, is also in prison here in connexion with the smuggling. Sardar J&amp;gat Singh has come to Tehran to see il he can do anything to help his partner Cheth Singh, who he assures me never had anything to do »Uh the matter at all and it is purely a false accusation on the part of Gulab Singh.

Subject*- 'Nok-Kundi - Mirjawa Mail contract' Sir, I have the honour to refer to foreign and Political Department letter No.F.396-N/29, dated the 15th February 1932, on the above subject. 2. The Political Agent, Kalat, now reports that the Director General, Posts and Telegraphs has decided to give the Nok-Kundi - Mirjawa Mail contract to the lowest tenderer, S.Kirpal Singh, and not, as approved by the Government of India, to S.Jagat Singh. The former's tender was Hs.250/- 2 p.m. against Rs. 320/- by the latter, and the Director was informed by the Political Agent, Kalat, that the latter figure was, in his opinion, the lowest compatible with efficiency. This opinion the Director has rejected and it is apparent that he can have no conception of the condition of road communications in the Nolc-Kundi - Mirjawa area. 3. In view of the recommendation contained in my letter No.934-S, dated the 18th December 1931, and of the definite orders of the Government of India in their letter referred to above, I am unable to acquiesce in the Director General's decision and would request you to take up the matter with the Posts and Telegraphs Department.

Dated Camp Meshed the 23rd July 1932. Major C.K.Daly C.I.E. His Britannic Majesty*s Consul, Sis tan &amp; Kain* The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Sir, C 7$: w e l' t ENCLOSURf in FOREIGN SECR C SI MLA. e* I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 262 (No.43 to Tehran) of the 8th July 1932 and your telegram No. 1599 in reply thereto, in irhich the Government of India were unaLle to agree to the issue of a passport, after recovering substantial cash security, to enable Narain Singh to return to Persia. The brief outline of Narain Singh f s case is as follows He first came under notice in regard to his activities in the Akali Agitation and underwent imprisonment in India for publishing objectionable articles in the Press. In this connection it may be observed that, at the time of the AJcali Agitation, practically every Sikh in East Persia was involved in anti-British Activities. Subsequently he continued petty business in East Persia and was suspected of acting as an intermediary for conveying correspondence from Soviet Consulates to India - that is to say that reports were received to this effect - though no actual proof was forthcoming. Later, Sewa Singh, who it was definitely established was a member of the Ghadr organisation, gave information, in India after his deportation, which indicated that Narain Singh also belonged to that organisation. Again Letter m 0 1 1 Q . bated ZEAUG i later, Narain Singh applied at Tehran for a Visa for * eceiv?t 12 Sf k ^'the United States of America. In view of his apparent connectionconneotion witti ttie Gb(dr organisation, I urged that ttie Visa t&gt;e refused, as it seemed obvious that tie was proceeding to America in connection witti ttie activities of ttie Party. Ttie above record is undoubtedly very bad, but I would L^bmit that the portion concerned with the A&amp;ali Agitation of many years ago, should not necessarily be held against Narain Singh, in connection with his more recent, and more serious, alleged connection with the Grhadr Party. As mentioned before, nearly every Sikh in East Persia was a party to the Akali movement, and many came within the orbit of the Law. After Narain Singh was refused a Visa for America, he returned to Zahidan and from there came to Sis tan to see me. He declared emphatically that he had no connection with the G-hadr Party. He admitted fully, his anti-British attitude over the Gurdwara affair, but claimed that that was finished, he had been punished, and that it should ncfct still be the cause of suspicion against him. He enq.ui.red whether he would run any risk in visiting India. I informed him that the line to adopt in order to clear himself of suspion was to show by his future behaviour that he auite definitely had no further connection with any anti-British or Revolutionary organisations * that if he did so and later wished to visit India, I would not ask for any action to be taken against him, but could not answer for the attitude of the authorities in India, who might have information aconceming him of which I had no knowledge. He then volunteered to lodge security for good behaviour if desired. His activities thereafter have been watched, and from information received by me direct, and from reports from H. B.M*s Vice-Consul Zahidan, I have no reason to suppose that he has engaged in any anti-British action. In short our case against him iss- I. His anti-British attitude in the Akali movement - in which all the other sikhs in East Persia were concerned. 2. His supposed liason with the Soviet Consulates. 3. Sewa Singh's statement that he was one of the Bhadr Party( Ohair Party memlDers in Bast Persia. 4. His attempt to 01)tain a Visa for Ajnerica. 5. His alleged meeting with Amrik Singh in Kerman in June last. of these (i) Is abundantly proved* (2) Was based on reports* Beports of this nature in East Persia need to be considered with great circumspection. The Sikhs are active rivals in trade and such reports are frequently prompted by rivalry in commercial affairs* However it behoved me to inform the autnorities in India of his being suspect, and he was watched when he paid a visit to India in 1930 - nothing transpired* (3) There are grounds for considerable suspicion, but Sewa Singh - a fanatical and unscrupulous individual is well capable of giving false information involving any person with whom he was at enmity. (4) In view of the suspicions we had, our conclusiong that he might be visiting ijnerica for nefarious purposes, were not unreasonable. Nevertheless I have, since, from variety of sources learnt that his principal object in wishing to visit America was for the purpose of endeavouring to obtain the Ford Motor Agency for East Persia. I am inclined to accept this as correct, although it does not rule out the possibility that he had also other intentions. (5) It is true that he visited Kerman on business in June, but that he went there for the express purpose of meeting Amrik Singh, is I believe, not correct. Amrik Singh arrived in KermansST) in Kerman on tils way to Zatiid^ n and actually arrived in Zatiidan a week 'before K.S. returned so that if a meeting were tbe object, there was no necessity for N.S* to proceed to Kerman. He could have met Jkmrik Singh in Zahidan without drawing attention to himself, I believe the meeting was purely accidental. Before visiting India, Narain Singh called on our Vice- Consul at Sahidan - informed him of his impending visit to his father - and asked whether he would be interfered with in India,* Captain Pinhey informed him that no action would be taken here, but he could not answer for the attitude of authorities in India, who, as was known to him, regarded his record as bad. belief is that Narain Singh did, at one time, sympathise with the members of the Chadr organisation in Persia, although the extent to which he was involved has never been proved* I also incline to the view that when he was inpecunious he may well have acted as a letter carrier for friends in liason with the Soviet Consuls - very few of the Sikhs in East Persia when short of money, miss any opportunity of rasing funds from any source available. He is an astute business man and during the last two years has made a moderate fortune - probably a Lakh of rupees. His altered circumstances, and the example of Sewa Singh, Amrik Singh and others, has not been without effect. I believe he was genuinely desirous of living down the past and of being •respectable’. Before leaving for India, he had to give security to the Customs authorities at Zahidan for 50,000 Rials - which he must forfeit if he cannot return. All his assests are in Persia It is freely stated he will contrive somehow to return to Persia, and will apply forfor naturalisation as a Persian subject. If the rumour that is current here 'be tcue that the notorious Sewa Singh has escaped police observation in India and disappeared, and may be expected to turn up again in Persia or Afghanistan, it is not unlikely that Narain Singh will be equally successful. . We shall then have less control over him, than would be ijj the case had he been allied to return after lodging a r substantial cash securt by * A copy of this Despatch is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister Tehran under No. 67 of 23/7/32.

Cli ve had the “V honour to address YouTiighness on the subject of certain Indian British subjects known to be active members of the Ghadr organisation in Persia. The names of these men, who Sir R. Clive suggested might, with advantage to both the Imperial Government and the Government of India, be deported from Persia to Indi**, were (1) Amrik Singh, son of Jai Singh, (2) Tajamul Hussein, (3) Nasib Singh son of Domak Singh. 2.. About a month later Mr. Charles Dodd had the honour to mention to Your Highness that two of these m*n (Tajamul Hussein and and Nasib Singh) were on their way to Tehran to appeal against an order for their deportation made by the Governor-General of Khorasan. It subsequently transpired that Amrik Singh was coming too. 3 . The three men arrived in Tehran in July and have since been retained here under surveillance by the Police. They have visited His Majesty’s Legation and have invariably stated that they did not come to^ Tehran of their own accord to appeal against deportation, but were brought hero by the police for their case to be investigated. They have applied as British subjects, for the intervention of His Majesty's _ie Sa .Uon in order to have their detention at Tehran ended. Utter madl4in%ir R. Clive's note, I venture to suggest to Your Highness that uted 26MAY ^ek^onths is a sufficient period for the completion of any investi-■0 ^ 2 . investigations that may have been necessary. If the I m P crl Government feel able to deport the men either to India or to an y other country, if this will present fewer difficulties I shall . be most grateful. But if not, I should prefer, so far as Has Majesty's Legation is concerned, that they should be allowed to leave Tehran, as their indefinite detention is becoming increasmg y difficult to explain and justify. 5 . if, however, the men return to East Persia, I have the honour to request that they may be kept under strict surveillance and if this surveillance proves that they are engaged in revolu tionary activities, that steps may be taKen to prevent them from engaging in such activities for the future. ihe local c . ^ the activities in which are understood to be already ful y awnr the men were engaging before their removal to Tehran. ! avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Highness the assurance of my highest consideration.

British Legation, Tehran, May 6 th, 1932. / Dear \7ylie, As Dodd is away on leave I am answering your demi-official letter No 396-N/29 of j ebruary 25th about the attitude of the Persian Government towards the deportation of Indian revolutionaries. 2 , According to tne Cnlef of I-dice, tne Persian Government are very reluctant to deport Amrik Singh,Tajamul Hussein and Nasib Singh (and presumably onyone else) for the very reason given out by Gulab Singh, that is, that the Soviet Government would instantly ask for the deportation of a number of white Russians. Although there is a great theoretical difference between asking for the deportation of a man against whom a definite charge can be brought an d of a whole class of persons against whom nothing out a general charge of opposition to the existing regime can be oi ought, yet there remains a good deal to be said for the Persian point of view. Tne Soviet authorities are quite capable of bring ing specific charges against white Russians, it pressed to do so, and apart from this most countries are rather chary of deporting political offenders, at any rate to their own country, as the lino between this and extradition is rather hard to draw. 3 , The situation of Amrik and Company is oeginning to be rather embarrassing to us. We realise that they may be doing less harm here than in Bast Persia, and ve do not v«ant to be rid of them from merely selfish reasons. But they conm here constantly (Brenan bears the brunt of their visits) , complain.y To , . ^ t th . v , re bc in. detained by the police who say complain tho.t thoy arc o^in^ + y. r of action by ttic Legation, that the detention i&amp; tee ,, -pv»niri '&gt; v id aslo thet tnat a word from whom will set theui f ,.„ ra .hail h. ..id. »*« lins their ceiling here n* nethln* to ho »i«, m.

Please refer to your secret letter No.2/P.P./31-11 of 25th February in which you state that the Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau suspects that proscribed newspapers are carried into Persia by lorry drivers from Kundi to Gulab Singh,Karain Singh and others. (2) Gulab Singh has been mentioned on other occasions recently for supposed anti-government proclivities, I therefore attach hereto a note on this individual* ( 3 ) As far as is known, no objectionable papers have, so far, appeared at Zahidan, at least tney have not been seen or discussed among the Sikhs there, but this does not preclude the possibility that they are received and passed either to agitators in the interior, such as Nasib Sing h, 1 Shahj i* etc who are as far as is known still in Tehran, or they may be procured for the Soviet Consuls elsewhere, as it is known that the late Soviet Consul at Sistan used regularly to obtain such papers through the Sikhs. (4) Although my subordinates at Zahidan are in close touch with the Persian police there in regard to this matter, since the introduction of such literature into Persia is prohibited, it is an extremely difficult matter to intercept material. I would suggest that some action, might appropriately be taken at Kundi by the Baluchistan authorities I shall be glad to be informed of the results, if any further enquiries which are made. Sd. C.K.Daly, Major,C. 1.3., £$is Britannic Majesty’s Consul,Sistan and Kain.Note on &amp; a hi dan* This young man has for some time past been suspected of anti- government proclivities by the Baluchistan Intelligence Department,and has been reported as a supposed member of the Ghadr party and also for making various undesirable statements and being suspected of receiving prohibited literature from India. Neither I, the present Vice-Consul at Zahidan, nor his predecessor who knew a good deal of this individual consider that he is in the least dangerous. He is a vain and exceedingly stupid young man, who is regarded both by Europeans and Indians at Zahidan as a fool. I do not believe that he has either the character nor the pluck to really associate himself with any dangerous proceedings, and I am convinced that other Sikhs would not trust him. This being so, what gives rise to the fairly persistent reports received against him at Quetta? The solution of this is, I think, to be found in the quarrels of the local Sikhs, who for some time past have disseminated false reports regarding trade rivals, in the hope that some action would be taken against them, as in the case of Sewa Singh. Grulab Singh is the son of a well-to-do trader. He was provided wi tn a capital of Ss. 10,000 to trade in Persia. This he invested in partnership with Gopal Singh s/o Mohan Singh (nephew of the late K. S.Jowala Singh). He proceeded to spend money fool is hly, spending far more than he could earn, and recently in order to make both ends meet, became the local agent for Jagat Singh (Postal Contractor between Kundi-Mirjawa). He is related to Jagat Singh 1 s wife. Culab Singh’s father visited Zahidan some time ago and tried to induce hi« son to return to India, as he was dissatisfied at his extravagance. Gulab Singh declined to return. The father then endeavoured to induce Gopal Singh(who lives ilives in Zabul) to break the partnership with Gulab Singh, but Jaggat Singh, a third partner refused to dissolve the partnership. The father then undoubtedly appealed to certain other Sikhs, who happen to be trade rivals of Gulab Singh and hie partners, to do their best to make things too hot for Gulab Singh in Persia* The latter has not been slow to disseminate reports against Gulab Singh. Among other reports Gulab Singh is credited with having stated that the Persians would never again deport an Indian, as in the case of Sewa Singh, because if they did, pressure would be brought on them to similarly deport Russian subjects who are ♦wanted* by the Soviet for Political reasons. I know of no reason why this statement is particularly attributed to Gulab Singh* As a matter of fact as soon as Shahji, Nasib Singh and others were arrested by the Persians and subsequently taken to Tehran, but not deported, this rumour was current among all the Sikhs in Bast Persia. It was openly stated that they would not be deported because the Soviet authorities had promised to support them. That some of them, who were known to be destitute of means, have contrived to live for montns in Tehran, rather points to the facts that they have been in receipt of funds from somewhere. Until tnerefore, I obtain more reliable information I am disinclined to consider Gulab Singh a dangerous agitator, tnough he is unguarded and foolish enough to repeat state ments made to him by others.

Subject:- 'Hok-hundi- Mirjawa Mail Contract w . A reference is invited to Foreign and Political -O ENCLOSUnr; IN INDIA FOREIGN SE3fM T '' Letter No 13 , Dated 22 JAM. 1332 ■ 15 FEB. 1332 pn Department telegram Ho. 2086-b, dated the 18th ^ August 1931, in which I was instructed to cancel the contract concluded with Jagat Singh, son of R.S.Jowala Singh, for the carriage of mails between Mok Kundi and Mirjawa. 2. In accordance with these instructions tenders were called for by the Director of Posts and Telegraphsj Sind and Baluchistan Circle, Karachi, for the carriage of mails which, pending the con clusion of a new contract, continued to be trans ported by Jagat Singh’s firm. The lowest tender was put in by the firm of Kirpal Singh, Brothers, Army Contractors, Quetta, and in accordance with the instructions of Government enquiries into the finanacial and political status of this firm were made both locally and from His Majesty’s Consul, Seistan. As a result it appears that this firm has had no previous experience whatever of contract work in the Mirjawa area and His Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, reports that he has received information that it has made private arrangements with the present contractor to take over his lorries, and ( would therefore presumably continue to employ the \ lthe present drivers. To give the contract to the firm of Kirpal Singh, Brothers, would, therefore, be obviously unsatisfactory and I am not prepared to agree to such a course. 3. The reason which led the Government of India to order the cancellation of Jagat Singh*s contract appears to be their suspicion that he is intimately connected with the Ghadr Party. In a letter ITo. 1.1*. 13^ of the 4th August 1931, to the General Staff, i it himrini 'i ntm m mmwm nu Army Headquarters, Captain Snnis of tha Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau wrote n In view of the professed purpose of the Ghadr Party it seems meet risky to allow them to have anything to do with the transport ing of the Hail s ' 1 and a reference to this letter was made in the Foreign and Political Department telegram referred to above. 4. 'Inquiries into Jagat Singh’s connection with the Ghadr Party had been instituted by me before I received your telegram ordering the cancellation of his mail contract and have since continued. Fran the information which I have obtained from the Baluchistan Intelligence Bureau, from the Quetta Police and from His Llajesty’s Consul, Seistan, I have no doubt whatever that any suspicions regarding Jagat Singh’s Ghadr Party activities are unfounded. Jagat t^ingh is the soi_| of R.S.Jowala Singh, a well known ^uetta contractor. His uncle R.S.S&amp;rdar Mohan Singh and his father accompanied the McL'ahon Boundary Commission to Persia and his firm did important army contract work in Bast Persia during the Great War. He is himself a Municipal Commission er of Quetta and a man of standing here. It is true that certain of his relatives, who now reside in lahidan and elsewhere in Mast Persia, are suspected,&gt;i3 suspected of being members of the Ghadr Party, but, as the Government of India are aware, the loyalty of every member of the Sdkh Community in ISast Persia must be regarded with grave suspicion. After going into the matter most carefully I am of opinion that the loyalty and integrity of S.Jagat Singh himself are above suspicion and in this connection I invite a reference to your letter to His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran Ho. P.396-H/29, dated the 7th Hovember 1931. In this you informed the Minister that Jagat Singh was reported to have returned to India from the Par Hast in either July, August, or September of 1930, after distributing seditious pemphlete in Clc. bhangnei ana being convicted there for m ■•ting in a manner prejudicial to the public safety'. I have had careful enquiries made into S. Jagat Singh’s movements during 1930 and I find that he was in uUetta throughout that year and has also never visited the Far ^ast. I am not aware of the grounds on which the Government of India have identified the Jagat 3.ingh of Shanghai with Jagat Singh, son of R.S.Jowala Singh of Quetta, but there appears to be no doubt that the identity of these two persons has been confused to the serious detriment of the latter, and it is possible that this confusion was to some extent at least responsible for the decision to cancel the present mail contract* 5. The Special Consular Mail bags from India to Hast Persia are enclosed with other Registered matter in large sealed mail bags which are specially pointed out to the Chagai Levy Hscort on the Mail Lorry which takes over the Mails at Mok Kundi Post Office each Tuesday morning. The Mail Lorry travels with this escort to Mirjawa and delivers its load direct into the Indian Exchange Post Office where it is sorted&gt; I (gab sorted according to the Indian Exchange Post Office Manual. The Special Bags are delivered by the Indian Exchange Post lias ter to the representative of the Tice Consul, Zeiiidan. This takes place in the Indian Exchange Post Office, where the Mirjawa Persian Post faster is present at the time of sorting, the latter affixing his arrival date stamp. The special Bags are placed in a large mail bag which is locked and des patched to Tahidan by Consular Courier. This courier travels to ^ahidan on the mail lorry and delivers his bag to the Tice Consul that same evening. The sealed Mail Bags from Persia to India are prepared in the •ahidan Tice Consulate on Tuesdays. They are sealed and stamped ready for registration, and are carried to Mirjawa by 4he Consular cotirier on the mail lorry which leaves Zahidan during Tuesday/.Vednesday night. At Mirjawa these bags are taken to the Persian Post Office and registered, and accompanied by the Consular Courier to the Indian Axcnagge Post Office where they are included in the Registered Mail bags and despatched in charge of the Lemy escort. Thus the Special Bags do not remain for any length of time in Persian Postal hands. Bags for Persia are not touched by Persian Postal authorities (except for affixing date stamp in Indian Exchange Post Office) and bags from Persia are n, t unattended during the short period of half an hour occupied by their registration at Hirjawa Post Office and their transfer inside sealed outer bags from the Persian to the Indian Exchange Post Office. o. As i ar as the saiety of the mails is concerned it is tiaus immaterial who drives the Postal lorries as the Special Bags are continuously under the special supervision and charge of the Levy escort and the Consular courier. Puri her, a regular system of passport control has now been introduced at Pok Kundi and driversA drivers on the Idrjawa-Kundi line are required to obtain special visas from our representative in Duzdap. The chances of the Consular Mails being tempered with between Uok Kundi aiii Duzdap are therefore remote• 7. As I have stated I do not consider that the fim of Kir pal Singh is a suitable one to carry out the contract I am unav/are of what firm has quoted the next lov/est rate, but it is probable that it also will be owned by Sikhs and, as I have already pointed out, every Sikh in -*ast Persia must be regarded with some suspicion. I consider, therefore, that nothing will be gained by taking the contract from Jagat Singh. Kis Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, based his objection to the contract being given to this firm in the first place on the ground that its reputation for de endability was poor. Since it took over the carrying of the mails at very short notice it has, as far as I am aware, given satisfaction and His Majesty’s Consul’s objection would presumably no longer be maintained.. I consider, therefore, that Jagat Singh should be permitted to continue with his contract, but I would add a clause to his agreement making it obligatory on him to dismiss forthwith any driver to whom His Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, or the Political Agent, Chagai, should object. I have consulted His Majesty’s consul, SeiStan, who agrees witi these proposals which I request may now be sanctioned. Sd/-.

If the Persian Branch of the (xhadr Party is receiving funds from Moscow it is not done, so far as I know, with the knowledge of the Party in California, but the connection between the Persian Group and the Ghadr Party Headquarters is in any case a very loose one. 3.11.31.No* 807« ( x^ v aacHaT.

Copies of it are also being sent to the Agent to the Governor General ana Chief Commissioner in Maluchietan and to the Consul, Sietan , who are being as fed to supply any farther information that may be available regarding this man's activities and to send copies of their reports direct to you. I have the honour to be, Sir, lour most obedient servant, Sd/- P.V.Wylie, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.*v^ Note on flarain Singh, Narain Singh is the son of Ishar Singh of £allcashar&gt; Jhelum District, and a brother of Nanak 8in$i with whom he paid a visit to India in 1930 on a mission, His Majesty* s Consul, Sistan, stated, for the Soviet Consul. We were, however, unable to get anything against him during his stay in India. It seems that the fact that they were being watched really prevented them from engaging in any activities; for, on their return to Persia, His Majesty* s Consul, Sistan, reported that both had remarked that they had been too closely watched to accomplish anything. Narain Sin^i visited Lahore also. Both brothers are shown as having been discouraged by the arrest of the editor of the 'Kirti*, a violently anti-British newspaper of Amritsar, and of a private medical man at Lahore with whom they were in touch* His Majesty's Consul, Sistan, further stated that, on his return to Persiat Narain Singh continued activd anti- British propaganda. Details, however, were not communicated* In September 1930 Narain Singh was noticed in quetta by the Baluchistan Intelligence Branch, who described him as a notorious anti^British agitator who had traded in Duzdap for the last 14 years. His visit was a business one though he later visited his home, but nothing suspicious was noticed. The Baluchistan I.B., in March 1931 communicated to this Bureau the names of several Sikhs, amongst which were those of Narain Singh and his brother Nanak Sin#i, in Bast Persia who, they stated, were foremost in anti-British intrigues with the Bolsheviks. Again in July 1931 the Baluchistan I.B., reported that Narain Singh was in communication with Sewa Singh, the deported member of the Birjand Ghadr Party, and, later, recommendedrecommended his deportation as a measure liicely to cripple the Ghadr organisation in Persia# Hai’ain 8 in$i would appear to be identical with the Narain Singh who recently applied in Teheran for endorsements on his passport to enable him to travel to America via Iraq* Syria» Germany 9 France and the United Kingdon^ as the former was reported by the Baluchistan I.B.* to have gone to Teheran# It is reported that the Zahidan party were worried at the non-receipt by them 9 for some considerable time 9 of literature which had been supplied either from America or Russia so sent Earain Sin^a to Teheran to get into touch with the Russian authorities there# The ideat it is thought 9 is to move their headquarters from Zahedan to Teheran where they think they will have more scope for carrying out their work#- 2 f ' Notes.

Sewa Singh arrived at Quetta from zshidan (Buzdap) ? on the 27th February 1931? and left for Amritsar on the 1st instant. He has been sent under close surveillance and the Punjab C.I.Bo has been informed about his departure. During his stay in Quetta Sewa Singh confided the following frets to a 'Source’ 1 t- He admitted that he was a member of the Ghadar Party of America, and stated that he used to get literature? pamphlets? papers and posters etc., from their centre in California via the Air route. He further s^id that the articles were never received through the Indian post, because it was too risky end moreover the other route is more direct and much safer. Sewa Singh boasted of the fact that he had managed things in such a way as to leave no trace behind by which he could be implicated in the conspiracy. He talked about a stamp? which he had either made or, was going to make (the informant did not quite make sure on this point) to stamp all Ghadar Party literature before distributing them? with the seal 'Ghadar p^rty of Persia'. He further gave out that if Bhagrt Singh is hanged British Officers in Persia would be killed, and that his party was quite re^dy for this 'Action'. He also said that one Kalyan Singh was acting as a spy of the British Government in Persia, and that his party had therefore decided to kill him on the 'Shahidi Gurpurb', celebrated on the 22nd of February in rememberance of the Nankana Sahib Martyrs, but that this 'Action' did not come off because of his arrest which upset the programme of the party. S ev/aS 3'7 g Singh nontioned the following rn :i prcmin:nt members of the Gh^idgr perty in Persia?- 1. A^rik pingh of Thanila, District Jhelum* 2# Shagwant Singh, 3. Huh arm ad Amin. 4 • H a j i • All these rnen are motor drivers. He also mentioned that Day cl Singh, Akali 9 and Gobind Singh were members of his party in Quetta. The former is a shop keeper in Quetta since about 3 years but had been in Persic, for a very long time, end the latter is a clerk in the Hazara Pioneers, Quetta* Sew a Singh spoke of Am rik , S ingh in very high terms end it appears that it was he who acted as a carrier for him. Sewa Singh was asked whether with his deportation from Persia the work of the party will cease, and he replied that it would go on as usual, and that he had given over charge to some one in Birjcnd, but he would not disclose the na- c of that individual. He further stated that Akali Ha ra in Singh of Du-zdap had sen' telegrams to the Shah of Persia protesting against this deperta tion. Asked as to his future course of conduct he replied that he would first go to Amritsar and try to meet Master Tore Singh, Sardar liangal Singh end the Editor of the ’'Kirti’ 1 . He would also enlist the support of the Congress and che Sikh Lergue Lecders, with a view to have the matter taken up in the Assembly. When told that it was the Persians who had deported him and not the British, he said that it wes all due to the instigation of the British Government. He further stated that his case would also be taken up by the League of Hctionst through the influence of a certain Indian of California who was a larding member of the Ghad.gr Party, but also had much influence with the League. From the conversation of Sew a Singh it appears that then is at present in Birjend a mysterious individual who calls himselfii ft Vv* 5^ ' htnsslf 'Hindi Bhai'. It is said that his real name is Ghulam - - ***+'* * LIulii-ud-Din and that he is an Indian Muhajir* nothing beyond this is, however, known about him and he himself is said to be extremely secretive about his past history* This man is said to have come to Birjand about a couple of months ago from Russia. He was in a destitute condition ^nd is now working with one g hahji a nother Kuhajir who has a foundry in Birjand. Both Shahji cand Hindi Bhai ere believed to be suspicious characters. 3ew a Singh is a Matriculate of the Punjab University and states that he had worked for about three or four months as a clerk in the 55th Regiment at Delhi. One of his elder brothers is said to have become a Fakir. He himself also impresses one to be a man of low mentality but he has a tremendous amount • * . of self confidence. He very laughingly told a police officer that he had seen the Persian prison but v. r as now anxious to see the Indian ! Jail and then perhaps the ' Phansi When questioned as to the import of the word “Kirti” which he used as his surname, he replied that it was meant to show that he belonged to the 'Mazdur party' and that he was willing to lay down even his life, if he could thereby redress wrongs that the ''Sermaidars' (Capitalists) were doing on the poor labouring class.Copy of a .Confidential memorandum Ho. 390 S.S., d^tec.

At the same time another Sikh shopkeeper and a motor driver as well as a Persian, of whose activities I had occasion to complain to the Governor last year, were also arrested. The Persian was threatened with punishment if he continued to disseminate anti-British propaganda and the Indians were subsequently released after warning that their activities would be watched. The prompt action taken by the Persian authorities has already had a salutary effect. Shortly before Siwa Singh was arrested another anonymous letter was received by H.M.Vice-Consul, Duzdap, from Birjand, which had undoubtedly been despatched by this individual.Notes. Minute Paper.

Extract from Diary of His Britannic Majesty ! s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the month of June, 1930. 64. Soviet Activities .- It is reported that there is much friction between members of the Soviet Consulate staff at Sistan. The Consul, Attache and Zenshinoff went to Duzdap on ! T ay 19th . The two former proceeded to Birjand as reported in Diary for May. They returned to Sistan on May 30th. Zenshinoff returned alone from Duzdap. Nanioff (locally called Bobnoc) Vice-Consul, left for Duzdap en route for Tehran on June 2nd. There is a / rumour tha.t the Attache Jaribegoff (Jarbekian Amenian) is preparing to leave Sistan for good and that Zenshinoff intends to see him away from Duzdap. This man has been in Sistan since the Soviet Consulate was reopened. He has been employed in their relations with certain individuals at Duzdap. It is possible that the friction referred to above has occurred with him and they are anxious to see him safely away from Duzdap where he might give away information. A M. Rival lias arrived at the Consulate and it is rumoured that he will succeed Jaribegoff. The Soviet doctor Lorosoff (he was doctor at Sistan under the Czarist regime) called for the assistance of our Medical Officer in the treatment of his wife, suffering from an ear disease. The treatment was successful and he expressed gratitude for the help. A previous report that Baluchis are being induced to go to Russia, receives some confirmation from a complaint to the effect which has recently been addressed to the Govemorate by Sardar Khudadad Khan, who has apparently lost several of his cultivators. The Duzdap Nazmieh have received instructions to watch closely the movements of Russians there - it is said that/—that they are suspected of spreading anti-Persian propaganda among the Ba.luchis. A few months ago two Persians opened shops at Kwash. There were grounds for suspecting that the^ were Soviet Agents. The General Officer Commanding ordered them to leave Kwash. One is now in Duzdap and the other has gone to Sistan, where he has a small shop close to the Soviet Consulate. On June 17th an individual naned Predt Echensinj arrived at Duzdap in a car driven by a Russian named Vagarsehak Samisjan. He returned to Meshed on the 20th. He first informed junior police officials that he was employed by the Persians at Meshed and had been sent to make enquiries regarding locusts in the Duzdap District and that he would proceed to Bampur for the same purpose. On being further interrogated by the Reis-i-Nazmieh, he stated that he was an employee of Russtransit at Meshed and had been sent by them to enquire about the locusts. He engaged a Baluchi guide to take him to Bampur. He enquired from the latter how far the British border was from Bampur, what tribes resided there and names of the Sardars.*'(P. 7503/30) OONFIDTCKTIAL . Extract from Diary of His Britannic I&amp;jesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the month of August 1930. S 37. Spyict Activi1 1 er- . - ’’ T ith reference to paragraph 76 of Diary for July. The reply of the Meshed police was to the effect that the M Jowaz w held by Predit Uchensinj was not valid, that he is a Soviet Agent, and was to be returned under escort to Meshed. Subsequently the General Officer Comraanding in the Sarhad ordered him to return to Meshed, but did not subject him to a Military guard. Reference paragraph 64 of Diary for June. Of the two Persians previously mentioned as being Soviet agents, and having been turned out of Kwash by the General Officer Commanding, one - named Abul Hassan, son of Naziri - recently I again went to Kwash. The General Officer Commanding again sent him to Duzdap and threatened to shoot him, if again caught in the Sarhad. Meanwhile his companion, Haji Mahomed, had come to Duzdap from Sistan in the hope of joining Abul Hassan at Kwash. On learning the fate of his friend he abandoned his intentions and returned to Sistan. Shah Quli Khan and his father of Sistan, well known bad characters, and for some time past believed to be Soviet agents, have become Soviet subjects, No explanation has been forthcoming as to how they qualified for this change of Nationality, while in their own country. Haji Abdul Wahid, at one time employed by the Russians in North Persia, and now living at Birjand, recently indulged in a good deal of Anti-British propaganda in the town. It is significant that this occurred about the time the Soviet Vice-Consul at Sistan passed through Birjand en route to Meshed, i.e., about August 9th and after. As the result of a severe reprimand by Shaukat-ul- Mulk, this individual has ceased to openly display an interest in politics. A/A Russian 'Locust Expert” named Burt arrived at the Soviet Consulate, Sistan, at the end of July and left for Meshed on 2nd August. L\ Rowar, the recently appointed Attache at the Soviet Consulate, Sistan, holds a passport which he obtained from the Persian Legation at Los cow on 8th June 1929, ‘under the name of I'irza Khalil Sattar. He presumably also holds a Russian passport for use as required. There are indications that at many of the Persian Consulates abroad passports are issued with very little or no care. The cause for this may be a desire to secure passport fees, possibly a welcome form of income when the monthly pay cheque of the Consulate is in 'arrears”.Prom His 3riU*nnic Majesty’s ConsuH-tt; Sis tan and Main, Hated the 3rd December 19 30.

A message was recently conveyed by the Persian General Officer in Sarhad to me that he had information from Tehran that Soviet Minister had made proposals to Persian authorities with a view to obtaining permission to send Agents 'abroad” (presumably this me; ns into province). Russian authorities it appears are making determinea efforts to get into country south of Duzdap, either as a 'means of establishing connection with tribes in British territory or because disturbed state of Baluchistan affords material for their activities. It would appear that under guise of pursuing enquiries regarding locusts, which they profess to regard as a serious menace to Russia they are endeavouring to achieve tneir oeject.

SOVIET ACTIVITIES, (l ' b &amp; Sir 1 4 © I have the honour to inform the Government of India fur that for some months past members of the Soviet Consulate at Sistan have been paying frequent visits to Duzdap. The reasons for such visits have also ostensibly been to effect purchases or to receive stores from the railway etc. I found it difficult to credit that frequent journeys involving travelling 26©miles, over probably the most difficult road in Persia, would be undertaken for such inadequate reasons and I have endeavoured to ascertain if there were not some other motive. 2. I now have reasons to believe that the Sistan soviet consulate is being used ts a channel of communica tion with communists in India. A British Indian subject, has informed me that he was approached by the Russian Consul with a view to obtaining his assistance as a go- between with India. My informant says he replied that being in the employ of a British firm in Persia he could not undertake such work. He has however supplied me with the namss of two individuals in Duzdap believed by him to be used by the Soviet Consul for purposes of keeping in touch with India. I am taking steps to have the activities of these individuals watched and reported on and shouldit appear that there is some foundation for suspicion, a further report will be submitted. 4t the same time, my informant, whom I suspect of desiring to 'run with the hare and hunt with the hounds' will also be kept under observation as it is not impossible that, in spite of information afforded, he is also being of service to the Russian Consulate. 3* The severe check which has recently been ^iven to communist activities in India, has probably convinced the Soviet that communication with communists via the ports of India is fraught with danger of detection,, where as the Juzdap-ilushki railway is a much easier means of communication and less exposed to the supervision of our C.I.D. It also provides the quickest meang of communi cation with a boviet official, in a position to obtain sap speedy instructions from Russia. The fact that the Soviet Consul has let it be knov/n that he would like to be on good terms with this Consulate (although a certain amount of anti-British propaganda has been undertaken among the tribes along the Afghan border) may be actuated by a desire to distract attention from the more serious object of fomenting trouble in India and keeping in touch with agents there. 4. If the Government of India see fit, it might be an advantage if the Baluchistan Administration could be asked to utilise any means at their disposal to watch from the Indian end of the line. In this connection it is probable that intermediaries between the Soviet Consulate and agents in India would avoid Quetta and proceed to other centres in India direct from Spezand, since they must be aware that arrivals at U uetta are liable to come under the scrutiny of the police there, it is probable that any such intermediaries are Sikhs, and it is also likely that communications are carriedisz by hand and not entrusted to the post. Should enquiries at this end result in certain individuals coming under suspicion, the names will be communicated in due course, in order that their activities while in India may be watched. In the meantime it would be well if attention could be paid to the matter at Quetta and possibly Spezand. 5. A copy of this letter is being submitted to Hi Majesty*s Minister, Tehran.
