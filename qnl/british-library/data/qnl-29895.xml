To the Chairman of the Commercial Intelligence Committee of the Board of Trade. S ir i Resht, 20th December 1903. . I HAVE the honour to submit herewith a Report on the present condition and prospects of British trade and enterprise in Persia, as follows:— I. A General Report. II. Statistics as to the increase or decrease of foreign trade with Persia in recent years; and Tables of Imports and Exports for the two years March 1901-3, indicating the countries from and to which the various Articles of Commerce have been received or despatched. III. List of the principal Articles of Commerce in Persia, with information as to quantities, prices, areas of distribution or production of articles imported or exported. IV. The manner in which trade in Persia is commonly conducted; information as to coinage, exchanges, weights, and measures in use ; transport and packing of merchandise for inland destina tions ; and a table showing average cost of transport between the principal foreign markets and the principal commercial centres in Persia. V. Notes on the chief commercial centres, on local trade usages and other matters of commercial interest, and on the principal trade routes in Persia. VI. List of samples with descriptions and prices. In commenting on the different articles of trade I have had to follow the grouping adopted in the Persian Customs Statistics, and consequently have not been able to adhere strictly to the order indicated in the instructions issued for my guidance in this visit to Persia on behalf of the Commercial Intelligence Committee. # I desired to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to H. M. Minister and H. M. Diplomatic and Consular Officers in Persia, as well as to the manager and agents of the Imperial Bank of Persia, to the British merchants, and other British residents in Persia, for the kind reception and valuable help invariably accorded to me. I desire also to acknowledge the ready and courteous manner in which H. E. the Minister of Customs and the various customs officials and Persian merchants to whom I have applied have furnished me with information. I have, &amp;c., H. W. MACLEAN.a REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. I —General Report on British Trade and Enterprise in Persia, The total trade of Persia with foreign countries, as shown by Persian Customs Statistics, now exceeds 8,ooo,ooo/. sterling per annum, of which over 5,000,000/. are imports, and 3,000,000/. exports. These figures do not Include specie or bullion. The Customs Statistics are entitled to confidence as the Department is now properly organised and administered. They omit, however, certain articles of trade, mostly exports, which I venture to estimate at a value of from 150,000/. to 200,000/. yearly.* The records available for a comparison with trade at former periods are unsatisfactory. Such figures as I can offer (see pp. 11-14) confirm the conclusion I have formed from enquiry into a number of different lines of commerce, namely, that foreign commerce with Persia, both import and export, has steadily increased during the last decade, to the extent of perhaps twenty per cent. It is subject, however, to wide fluctuations from year to year, and comparisons of any one year with another may be quite misleading.! The export trade is made up as follows :— One*half, or more, raw vegetable products :—Dried fruits, 450/500,000/.; Raw cotton, 400/450,000/.; Opium, 280/320,000/.; Rice, 250/280,000/.; Gums, 80/100,000/. OneTourth, raw animal products :—Silk cocoons, 200/250,000/.; Skins and peltries, 100/120,000/.; Pearls, 80/100,000/.; Wool, 60/80,000/, &amp;c. One-fourth, or less, munufactures:—Carpets, 230/260,000/.; other textiles of silk, cotton, and wool, 150/180,000/. ; Leather, 40/60,000/. The import trade may be summarised as follows :— Six-tenths, or more, manufactures:—Cotton yarns and tissues, 1,800/2,300,000/. Other tissues of wool and silk clothing, &amp;c., 380/420,000/.;. Metals and their manufactures, 140/170,000/; Glassware and porcelain, 75/100,000/., &amp;c. Three-tenths, food substances :—Sugar, 1,000/1,300,000/. ; Tea, 220/240,000/.; Grain, 130/150,000/.; Spices, 40/60,000/., &amp;c. One-tenth, or less, raw materials, &amp;c.:—Kerosine, 40/50,000/.; Skins and peltries, 30/50,000/.; Dyes, 30/40,000/.; Tobacco, 30/40,000/.; Wool, 20/40,000/. The following is a rough summary of the trade done with Russia, the British Empire, and other countries respectively:— • The values attributed to the different descriptions of merchandise are somewhat less, I should say roughly from 10 to 15 per cent, less, than their r» al commeicial values at point of entry into or exit from Persia. There is also, no doubt, some merchandise whL-h still eludes Customs control, but 1 cannot estimate, with any accuracy, the qtl.ntity or va’ue of such cont.aband. The total foreign trade of Persia might therefore be estimated at quite 9 millions, or 5J millions imports and 3! millions exports. 1 The exports consist largely of raw produce, and are governed by the accident of good or bad harvests and ov prices abroad Imports consist principally of manufactured goods, of which large stocks in proportion to business have to be held on account of the long time they are on the way. They often arrive at the port of entry with a rush after a good trade has depleted these stocks and encouraged orders, thus sweding the trade statistics of one year at expense of another. 6GENERAL REPORT ON BRITISH TRADE AND ENTERPRISE. Trade with Russia. Total Trade. —Exports, about 1,500,000/. per annum,* imports, about 2,000,000/. per annum. Exports. —Five-sixths, raw or agricultural products, of which far the most important are dried fruits, raw cotton, and rice, then hides and peltries, wool, cocoon silk, and gums. One-sixth, manufactures :—Leather, carpets, and various tissues destined for kindred Muhammedan population in Russia. Imports. —One-half, sugar. One-fourth, cotton tissues. . One-fourth, other manufactures, including some 150,000/. value of kerosine, animals, flour, tobacco and other vegetable products. Trade with B/itish Empire. Total Trade.— -Exports, about half a million ; imports, two millions per annum. • r Exports,-— Chiefly raw products Dried fruits, opium, gums, pearls, raw hides. Manufactures are carpets and some silk tissues for India. Imports. —Three-fourths, cotton yarns and tissues, which form also quite two-thirds of the total imports of these commodities to Persia. One-eighth or less, other manufactures; and the rest tea, coffee spices «c., from India. ’ r * Trade with other Countries. Total Trade.

Imports. —Sugar from France and Austria, 200/220,000?. ; woollen, cotton and silk tissues chiefly from France and Austria, 250/300,000/. ; tea from China and Batavia, 50/60,000/. ; raw material from Turkey and Afghanistan, 180/200,000/.; other manufactures, chiefly from France, Austria, and Germany’ 160/190,000/. % Russia and the British Empire have consequently a preponderating interest in trade with Persia. Moreover, Russian trade shows a very marked ^increase in recent years, whilst British trade shows neither marked increase nor decrease.} The fact that the foreign commerce of Persia has developed in recent years, and that Russia has acquired a large share of this increase in trade whilst we have made little or no progress, has been frequently commented on, and may act or may have acted as a deterring influence to British trade and enterprise in Persia. I have endeavoured to ascertain the reasons for this fact, and venture to summarise them as follows : Fish, caviare, lumberwood, not noticed in the Customs statistics, may account for another ioo/ko 00O/. cf exports. ' ° ’ f Al'owing for omissions and ina-curacies of clnssific ttion in the Customs Statistics, the foreign trade of Persia might be estimated as fohowe-.—Russia, 4 millions; Biitish Empire, 3 mi lions; other countries 2 millions. ’ X The Consular Reports l have made use of show on examination that quantities are converted into values at somewhat high rater. 1 bus the Bushire Reports, ipoo-i, estimate tea at pi. to loi. per lb.; candles, 10s. 6 d to 1 os. pd- per case; loaf sugar, 20, ■ . to 21$ per cwt.; copper, 05*. per cwt (1901). Values only have’been used in this Report, as Customs statistifs, base! on an ad valorem tiriff, were more reliable for values than puai titles. In future they will be more reliable for quantities than values, but the administration is endeavour n? to secure accuracy in this respect. sREPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA.

The great impetus g.ven to our trade b g y these measures was already evident some i° or'5 years ago, » further facilities for reaching ? ew - or R les ? en . in S °! h C e °w f Se that existini? markets have not arisen. But it is during the last decade tnat measures tending to increase Russian trade with Persia have produce ^^The conquest of Transcaspia enabled the Persian province of Khorassan to devote itself in security to the agricultural development of its fertile soil, an the opening of the Transcaspian railway provided an outlet for these products, which could not afford the long and costly transport to the Gulf. Meantime the manufacturing centres of Russia—formerly more distant in time and cost of transport, through the vast extent of Russia itself, from Persian markets than we were—have been brought gradually nearer by improved steamer and rail communications. Water-borne transport by the V olga and Caspian has long existed, but has been accelerated and cheapened It is available however for the summer months only. Petrovsk and Baku now afford transport by rail the whole year round at freights only slightly higher than by the Volga route. _ The construction of the Batoum-Baku Railway and the Akstafa-Julfa road opened to Odessa and Black Sea ports a trade route to Azerbaijan superior in time and cost of transport to the Trebizond route, from which European merchandise for Persia was quickly diverted to it; but this door was soon barred to imports not of Russian origin.* The superiority of th,s route increases as the railway from Tiflis, now open to Envan, extends to the frontier at Julfa, which it is expected to reach within two years. All these measures of improved communication have been justified bv the development of the Russian territories w'hich they have penetrated and Kpnpfilpd hut thev have equally served to facilitate both import and export trade with Persia. The merchandise which can be most quickly supplied to a depleted market reaps the best profit. There is also a saving of interest and a more rapid turn-over of capital when goods take a shorter time m transit. The improvement in communications with Russia has materially reduced the time occupied in transport, and Russian merchandise now arrives in the markets of northern Persia perhaps three months or less from date of order, whilst our goods can seldom reach the same destinations within five or even six months of order. Russia possesses in the Armenian trader a suitable agent to press trade in the somewhat limited markets of Persia. He is a keen trader, living in the fashion of the country at small expense, and speaking and writing the language of both the Russian Armenian and of the Persian with whom he deals. For years past Russia has opposed a formidable Customs tariff to the import of many foreign commodities, but Persia has been protected against this tariff by the five per cent, ad valorem duties of the Turkomanchai treaty, and some of her products will continue to be protected under the existing Russo-Persian Customs Convention. It is almost surprising that Persian exports to Russia have not increased in greater measure. With a similar advantage we might have competed at Moscow via Bushire and Enzelp in those red ground prints now being driven out of Teheran by the Russian article. The most important exports to Russia are fruits, cotton and rice, representing a million sterling annually. * Exp orts to Europe continue to benefit, perhaps at the expense of imports, which have to bear the cost of returning unlreighted caravans to Trebizond.GENERAL REPORT ON BRITISH TRADE AND ENTERPRISE. Fruits imported into Russia pay duty at the rate of 25 copecks per poud when coming from Persia, and Rbls. r8o* per poud when coming from other countries. The Russian market for these products seems insatiable, and the important regions of production in Persia—Azerbaijan, Kazvin, Damghan, Shahrud and Khorassan are more accessible to Russia than to any other market. The trade in Ispahan, equidistant from the Caspian and the Gulf, is divided. Raw cotton is a most remunerative product in Khorassan, and is freely ex ported to Russia from Ispahan and even from Yezd and Kerman, but the exports from the Gulf are precarious and show little sign of increase. Cotton pays in Russia 40 copecks per poud from Persia, and Rbls. 4-15 per poud from other countries. It is quoted in Moscow at about 2 roubles per poud less than American cotton (say 20 per cent ), but is undoubtedly of poor quality, and is said to yield 8 or 10 funts less of yarn per poud than American cotton (40 funts equal one poud). The Russian and Persian production combined is estimated at less than half the annual consumption in Russia. I conclude, therefore, that the Persian producer is very much dependent Ufon this difference in duty on exports to Russia (see pages 33 and 35). Rice is grown for export in Ghilan and Mazanderan, and could not bear the cost of transport to Trebizond or Bushire. Unhusked rice pays in Russia 5 copecks per poud from Persia and 60 copecks per poud from other countries. I have not obtained evidence as to whether this preference confers any marked benefit on the Persian producer. An increase in exports, it is said, causes an increase in imports from the same country. The trader becomes familiar with the routine of business, the agent who disposes of his produce serves also to effect purchases, and suitable articles of commerce are brought to his notice. Banking commission on the return of funds is saved. Russia has taken measures to encourage the import into Persia of her manufactures. Special through rates for goods to Persia are accorded. I have not been able, in Persia, to compare them with the rates charged to frontier destinations within Russia, such as Erivan and Ashkabad. The steamship line to the Persian Gulf from Odessa has a subsidy of about 20,000/. per annum or 4,000/. per trip on five trips effected, and refund of canal dues. This expenditure secures to the Russian over the British shipper an advantage of 12 to 15 shillings per ton weight on cotton goods to Bushire. The Banque de Prets dePerse is connected with the Russian State Bank. Its manager is also a Russian Government official. The standing of this institution is therefore independent of current profits. For some years past, and specially during the last two years, this bank has devoted its attention to the development of Russian trade with Persia, particularly to imports into Persia, and most particularly to the import of cotton textiles. It delivers goods to clients at such prices as old-established Russian traders in Persia have been unable to compete with. Its operations have had, without doubt, a marked effect in increasing Russian trade with Persia. Drawback, said to be the equivalent of duties previously imposed, is granted in Russia on certain commodities exported to Persia f * t International Customs Journal, No 23, Rus-ia, October 1896. Drawback is granted on the following exports to Persia :— Cotton tissues :— A. Bleached or unbleached . B. Dyed and printed, except “ Adrianople dyed ” . C. Dyed and printed, of “Adrianople” dye . Linen textiles:— Yarns, unbleached • . . . Do. bleached • • . . Tissues, unbleached .... Do. bleached • . . . Do. dyed or printed Vodka : Grain • • . . . Fruit • • . . .

Rs. 175 per poud.REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Suoar forms quite one-half of the total imports into Pers.a from Russia. The peculiar regulations governing the export of this article from Russia have affected onW our shipping interests. A decrease in the supply of sugar to Persia from Russia would have given place to an increase from France and Austria, not from British possessions, and the consignments from these countries would have been largely to the Persian Gulf, and would have paid freight to British ships. Cotton tissues form one-fourth of Persian imports from Russia, and receive drawback on export form Russia to Persia, said to be equivalent to the duties levied on raw material imported over the Russian European frontier present rates are given in the footnote on the previous page. If the Russian and Persian cotton growers are able to obtain all or nearly all the benefit of the dutv of Rbls 4'i S per poud imposed on imports of raw cotton into Russia from other countries, by increasing their prices up to the level ol the imported com- modity of equal quality, then the drawback on categories A. and B. affords little or no advantage to the Russian manufacturer or exporter as compared with his British competitor.* With regard to category C., Turkey reds, at Rbls. S‘40, I have rot obtained in Persia information as to the nature or value of the substances employed in this dye from which to calculate the proportion of duty paid on them. The articles falling under this category form an important part of the imports from Russia. The Russian manufacturer caters for a large population in Russia with requirements similar to those of a large section of the Persian population, and therefore does not need to manufacture cotton prints, common glassware, pottery paper, hardware and mercery, lamps, candlesticks, and various articles’of clothing, expressly to suit the Persian market. This has been suggested to me as conferring some advantage in cheapness of production. Try turn tn trade with other European countries. The export of silk cocoons from Ghilan and Mazanderan, now of some importance, is chiefly to France and Italy, and has not interested British traders. In imports, cane sugar has not been able to compete in. the Gulf with French loaf or Austrian bag sugar. The increased demand in the southern provinces supplied from these countries appears to have more than compen sated for any loss of trade in northern markets taken by Russia. In silk tissues France and in woollen tissues Austria and France take a larger share of the trade than we do. Their imports are nearly all via Trebizond, purchased in Constantinople by Persian traders. In white and grey shirtings Holland has begun to compete with us. Lastly, I may draw attention to influences which have affected our owm trade. The British Empire has increased its takings from Persia of opium and gums. The grain trade has temporarily disappeared, owing to prolonged agricultural depression in the southern provinces and hampering restrictions which tended to throw land out of cultivation; it has been, in a fashion, compensated by an import of wheat, rice, and other foodstuffs, but that is a questionable benefit to our trade as a whole, as these regions, with good harvests, would have bought manufactured articles from us with their surplus agricultural wealth. It may be asked why the regions of Southern Persia accessible to our influence should not have developed in the same measure as the northern provinces. Luristan, Bakhtiariland, and Arabistan possess well-watered and fertile districts, but the peoples of these regions are still but little amenable to the authority of the central Government, and until law and order are more firmly established but little agricultural or industrial progress can be expected. Much of the southern and eastern regions has but scant irrigation water and little rainfall. Fars and Kerman might have beenGENERAL REPORT ON BRITISH TRADE AND ENTERPRISE. 7 expected to make greater progress. But these southern provinces have not the advantage of protected markets in which to sell their produce at artificial prices. Our imports into Khorassan were formerly destined in part for Trans- caspia, to which they entered until a few years ago at an ad valorem duty of sj per cent. Some of our cotton tissues and tea found a market there which is now cut off. A special concession is still made to Transcaspia in respect of green tea, but in such a manner as to divert this transit trade from Bunder Abbas and Khorassan to Batoum. I have endeavoured to trace, in the foregoing remarks, the principal causes which have affected the foreign trade of Persia in recent years, and the results arising from them. The agricultural development of Northern Persia, due to f reater facilities in reaching Russian and other markets and to protection of ersian products in Russian markets, has certainly increased the wealth of these provinces, and therefore their capacity to purchase commodities. Russia has no doubt obtained the greatest part of this increased import trade, but if we eliminate one commodity, sugar, her relative progress in import trade will appear much less striking, and be found to have consisted in an in crease of manufactured articles, principally cotton tissues, glassware, pottery, iron, ironmongery, etc. No improvement in communications would have sufficed to increase Russian exports of manufactured goods to Persia unless she had been able to supply these articles. It has been constantly pointed out to me that Russia’s manu facturing skill has made great progress. Her common pottery now competes not only in price but in appearance and quality with other imports. Her common glassware competes on equal or superior terms *with Bohemian and French wares of the same class. Her metalwork—lamps, candlesticks, enamelled-ironware—is stated to be much better in quality and finish at a given price than formerly. It is of course in cotton prints that her competition is most felt by us. Our tissues have to some extent been driven out of the northern provinces, and the fact that our imports do not show a marked decrease must be attributed to the increased consumption in other parts of the country compensating for markets lost further north. I have formed the conclusion that Russian prints have not established a distinct ascendancy beyond such markets at Tabriz, Kazvin, Teheran, and Meshed. It may be questioned whether the trade really affords a sufficient margin of profit between the cost of production and transport and the price paid by the consumer; but without doubt it has been pressed most vigorously, and competent authorities, both Russian and British, have expressed an opinion that it has been pressed to excess, and that stocks have accumulated beyond the needs of the market. A Russian firm have been established in Ispahan for some two years past. They may or may not be making present sacrifices in order to establish this business in general cotton prints and tissues, but should they be able to establish a business dependent on ordinary mercantile profits, then there is no reason why Russian manufacturers should not be able to compete with Manchester in all parts of Persia—and even in Mesopotamia and India—for the cost of transport from Moscow to Ispahan vid Enzeli or vid Bushire (with State-aided freight) is about the same. Up to the present time our shippers in the Gulf have not found this competition formidable. It is stated that Russian manufacturers are asking for an increrse in the drawback allowed on cctton tissues, on the ground that the present allowance does not cover the taxes levied on the commodities consumed by their work men. A drawback on woollen tissues is also talked of. Whether the Russian Government will be inclined to give effect to such suggestions is beyond the province of this inquiry. It may at least have to consider the effect on the non-manufacturing population in Caucasia and Transcaspia of increasing the marked contrast between the price of certain commodities in these places and across the Persian frontier. In Persia, -tea, sugar, kerosine, prints and calicoes are all cheaper than in the Russian markets from which they are derived. ....8 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. On a general review of all these circumstances I venture an opinion that the impetus given to trade of other countries in Persia must already have produced nearly its full effect, and that our trade, which has survived this competition without very serious detriment, may expect to share in any exten sion of markets arising from the increase of wealth and population or from the greater consumption of foreign commodities in Persia. Statistics kindly furnished by the Administrator-General of Customs for the first quarter of 1903-04, compared with the corresponding period of the previous year, show a considerable increase in trade.* They are not encour- aging from the point of view of relative increase in our cotton textiles com pared with those of Russia. But I do not attach much importance to stat istical figures for a short period, and for this period in particular they are of little value to form general deductions from, as they must include much merchandise held over from the previous quarter when the new tariff first came into force. The population of Persia at the present time approaches ten millions, so that the annual consumption of foreign commodities is little over ios. per head—a little over 45. per head from Russia, a little less than 45. from the British Empire, and 2s. from other countries. As regards classes of foreign commodities the sum might be divided thus—about 4s. 6 d per head for textiles, 25. 6 d. per head for sugar, 6 d. per head for tea, and 25. 6 d. per head for other commodities. I believe there is, on the whole, a distinct improvement in the condition of the people. The question is somewhat obscured by the depreciation in the gold value of the silver coinage of Persia, as the first impression usually is that, prices having risen, the cost of living must have increased. But prices of labour and produce appear to have risen in proportion. Information obtained at the various places visited usually tended to show that the peasant is somewhat less hardly treated by landlord and taxgatherer, and is better clothed and better fed than formerly, and that more land has been brought under cultivation. Of course these circumstances have varied in different * Customs statistics:— Tea from Russia. Mans. Krans.

This year the southern harvest is more favorably reported on. I consequently think that the prospects of trade are encouraging. In Section III of this Report, pp. 15-48, I have endeavoured to furnish informa- tion on each article of trade, and do not venture to pronounce as to the parti cular lines of commerce likely to be remunerative. We have traders already engaged in business in the chief commercial ventres of Persia, actively com peting with each other and with foreign importers, and ready to take advantage of commercial opportunities. I do not by any means wish to imply that there is not scope for further commercial enterprise in Persia, but desire to point out that any such venture should be duly considered, and neither capital nor merchandise rashly consigned to Persia without previous inquiry as to the prospects of successful business in the particular line concerned. Cases of imitation of trade mark have been brought to my notice,* but this question does not appear to constitute a marked grievance in Persia. Industrial and manufacturing enterprises in Persia have rarely met with success. The number of such undertakings of any magnitude which have - survived more than a year or two is small: The Caspian Sea Fisheries Concession. The Lumber-wood Concession in Mazanderan. The Rail and Tramway Company of Teheran. The Imperial Bank of Persia. The Banque de Prets de Perse. Carpet-^making as conducted in Persia can hardly be described as a manufacturing enterprise, but it has proved successful, and might offer scope for further organization. The Banque Internationale de Commerce de Moscow has withdrawn from Persia. The enterprises which have failed to succeed in recent years are more numerous. The great cost of installing machinery on account of the heavy freight on inland transport, the cost of fuel, the inefficiency of labour which, although cheap, is unskilled and without energy, have been the chief causes of non-success. Telegraphic communications are now available at most of the large towns. As a result of our Indo-European line, the principal towns on the great trade routes from Teheran to Tabriz, to Meshed, and to Bushire, have now tele graphic communications, and there are now lines erected and maintained by the Persian Government to Resht, to Hamadan and Kermanshah, to Yezd and Kerman, and from Bushire to Shuster and Dizful.f Only Bunder Abbas remains without connection either with India or Kerman. The postal service has been much improved under Belgian administration. There are now bi-weekly services between Teheran and Meshed, Resht, Tabriz and Julfa, Kermanshah, Bushire, and Kerman, and intermediate places. A parcel-post to and from Europe via Russia has recently been introduced. Road construction has made some progress. Roads which have been constructed or are being undertaken are noted in Section V, pp. 53-67. I do not find that road construction in Persia has either shortened the time or lessened the cost of transport of merchandise. The roads already con structed have been built at great expense, and the tolls collected do not appear to provide adequate return on capital after providing for current expenses and upkeep. Wagon traffic has not in any instance driven mule or camel transport off these roads, and a comparison of rates (Anne x B, pp. 77-79) shows no marked difference between freight on roads or on similar caravan routes to the Persian plateau. * In Tabriz several close imitations (but not identical) of the trade marks of certain well-known British manufacturers of cotton sewing thread were shown me. Two British firms in Tabriz stated that close imitations (but not identical) of their trade marks had been made. A British firm in Shiraz mentioned a similar imitation in regard to one of their goods. uar imitai 'on t Over the Resht and Kermanshah lines messages can be sent in Roman character. They work fairlv well in dry weather, and when the operators are in attendance. ^ y wel1io REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Yet this question of providing more rapid and cheaper transport to inland markets seems to afford the best chance of increasing our trade in the central and northern provinces. The freight on a ton of piece-goods from Manchester to Bushire is about 2/. 55. and from Bushire to Ispahan 10/. to \il. The cost of transport from any seaboard to the Persian plateau is about gd. per ton per mile, whilst between markets in the interior, caravans work for 4^. to 6a. per ton per mile. On the southern and south-western frontiers grain and forage are as cheap as in the central provinces. It appears to me that an organised transport would serve better to reduce the time and cost of carriage of merchandise than a heavy expenditure on roads which, unless they inordinately increase the distance travelled, must include heavy gradients. The mule or camel can negotiate such steep gradients much more easily than the wagon, and if there is space for the caravan to carry its loads free of contact with rocks, trees and other caravans, the animals are indifferent to a pefect surface so long as it is not deep in mud, sand, or rolling stones. The load carried by a camel or mule does not impose excessive inconvenience in the packing of the merchandises in which we are most interested. The routes based on the Persian Gulf are those which most concern our trade. Outside of it our only important trade is by the Trebizond route, and our imports by it for the year March 1902-3 amounted to 227,000/., of which 66,700/. was tea (likely in future to follow the Batoum-Julfa route in transit), and the remainder chiefly textiles. The imports of other European nations (except Russia) were about 350,000/. Our shipping interests profit not only from our own but from all trade to the Persian Gulf. We do not carry even our own merchandise to Trebizond, whereas our shipowners earn freight on all goods (except Russian) passing to or from Gulf ports. An improvement in the conditions under which merchandise is landed and forwarded to inland destinations through Gulf ports appears to me one of the greatest benefits which could be conferred on our trade.STATISTICS OF PERSIAN TRADE. 11 II.—Trade Statistics. From a _ statistical statement under preparation, kindly lent me by the Administration of Persian Customs, I estimate the trade of Persia (exclusive of the Karun) with foreign countries for the year 21st March 1902 to 20th March 1903, exclusive of Caspian Sea fish exports and bullion imports, at— Imports 4,9*15,982 Exports . 2,889,565 Details are furnished in Annex A. Tables 1 and 2, pp. 70*74. The administration of the Customs of Muhammerah and Karun ports was only taken over from the Sheikh of Muhammerah in the autumn of 1902, and official Persian statistics for those ports are not available. Consular Statistics (Foreign Office r ‘Annual Series” No. 3036—Trade of the Persian Gulf) for Muhammerah and Karun ports for the year ending 31st December 1902, give— Imports 123,458 Exports 147,283 These figures are not for the same period as the Persian statistics, but admitting them as roughly representative of Karun trade, we have, for all Persia— £ Total Imports . • . . . 5&gt; 0 39,°oo ,, Exports ..... 3,036,000 8 &gt; 0 75 &gt; 000 Statistics for the previous year, on the same basis, give — £ Total Imports 5,297,000 „ Exports 2,849,000 8,146,000 The values given in the Persian statistics are those accepted by the Customs for payment of ad valorem duties, and therefore may be considered as fairly accurate but representing less (certainly not more) than the real value of the merchandise. The weights given in the same statistics are for the most part gross weights. The general rule observed in classifying articles seems to have been to ascribe merchandise to the different countries according to declarations of origin or destination, aided by marks, names, and indications on the packages. Contraband no doubt exists, and will continue to be practised across a frontier so wide as that of Persia. Under the Belgian administration it is at least real, not open, smuggling, and out of reach of calculation. Some important articles of Persian commerce, such as bar silver, fish, and precious stones, are not included in the Customs Statistics, presumably because they are not subject to duty. Imports of bar silver for the Persian mint amounted to some 650,000/. (krans 36,216,098 silver were struck at the Teheran mint during the year March 1902-3). The important fisheries on the Caspian, leased to a Russian subject, must furnish an export of fish and caviare to Russia of at least 80,000/. to 100,000/. annually. The turquoise mines of Nishapur yield valuable stones most of which are exported, but information is not obtainable as to the annual output.12 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. There are no reliable Customs Statistics prior to I9 0I &gt; consequently figures for purposes of comparison must be drawn from various sources. In Curzon’s “ Persia/’ the total import and export trade of Persia for 1S89 is quoted from official sources at 6,039,000/., and an estimate based on other calculations is made of an annual trade of 7,000,000/. to 7,500,000/. The Bushire Consular Report (“Annual Series” No. £ £ 2186) gives for 1895-96 an average trade (excluding specie) at the Gulf ports of Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah (after allowing for merchandise passing in transit through Lingah, and treating pearls as Persian produce exported only) and Muhammerah- of • . . 2,500,000 An estimate of the trade of Kermanshah for three years 1895-97 (Ispahan Consular Report “Annual Series ” No. 2260) gives an annual average of . 950,000 A Trebizond Consular Report (“ Annual Series ” No. 2588) furnishes information as to transit trade with Persia for two periods, 1891-95 and 1896-1900, giving an annual average of 773) 00 ° And Russian Customs Statistics for 1895-96 give an annual average of 3,460,000 7,683,000 The less important trade with Afghanistan and with Asiatic Turkey uid Soujbulak and Khoi is not embraced in these figures.

The greater part of these articles can be traced to imports by the Kermanshah route. Many goods imported via Bagdad are repacked there for caravan transport, and the bulk of the trade in such goods by that route is British and British Indian. Small lots of British and continental goods are also bought in Constantinople and Trebizond and imported to Tabriz in assorted lots by petty traders.14 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. 9 Similarly, some Persian products are entered as exported by the Ker- manshah route to Turkey, which are also articles of export from Bagdad and Busreh. These products are really in transit principally to China, India, and Britain. The returns show nearly 100,000/. value of carpets exported to the British Empire in 1901-02, and less than 7,500/. in 1902-03, accounted for by exports from Gulf ports. Our share in this trade passes largely m transit through Russia and Turkey. In 1901-02 krans 3,062,000 and in 1902-03 krans 7,695,000 are attributed to Turkey. Khorassan now furnishes the only important export of Persian wool (of which one-half is contributed by Afghanistan), and it all passes over the Transcaspian railway and figures in the returns as an export to Russia. It is, however, quoted and dealt in on the German, British and American markets. It must be immaterial to the Chinese and Indian tea growers whether the 25,000/. value of tea exported to Russia passes through Persia or goes direct to Batoum. The Customs statistics are so compiled as to show the trade with the British Empire as a whole, and not with the United Kingdom separately. In Annex A, Tables 4 and 5 (pp. 75-76), British and Indian trade have been separated as far as possible, but the figures, collated from local returns, can be made only approximately accurate, particularly in respect of the trade through Kermanshah, where fewer indications of origin are given in the Customs Statistics than at the Gulf ports. At these latter endeavours have been made to classify goods according to country of origin, and the Customs have availed themselves of indications on the packages in doing so. The figures for Indian trade, therefore, in a measure represent commerce in articles of Indian production and consumption and articles consigned to India as a first market. Consular statistics are not available for Kermanshah trade. For Bushire, Bunder Abbas and Muhammerah, they are given as follows :— Imports : British Indian Exports : British Indian passing through Bombay and Karachi. 1901.* 1902. £ '.1‘5,303 608,856 £ 807,853 5 ° 5 &gt; 1 7 1 l , 7 2 4 ,'S 9 «, 3 ‘ 3,°24 290,157 • 34,399 2 &gt; 7&gt; I 54 423,978 35',553 trade all merchandise Numbe Table StatistPRINCIPAL ARTICLES OF COMMERCE.

A pair of good carriage horses will fetch from 80/. upwards. Export. Up to 1 895 there w’as a steady export to Bombay from Bushire of country-bred horses, known as Gulf arabs, collected by dealers operating from Shiraz and Ispahan. This trade has almost ceased, perhaps bn account of a long period of drought and locust ravages in Southern Persia, and also from the higher prices ruling in the country. A smaller trade still continues from the Kermanshah region, perhaps 150 to 200 horses yearly to Bagdad, to form part of the now much more important trade from Busreh to Bombay. This Busreh trade was for some time smuggled through Muhammerah to escape the Turkish duty of ^5 per head. Consignments have been tried from Khorassan by the Seistan route to India, but there is difficulty in obtaining forage for horses on that route. Mules. Mules are bred and used in the country. Kermanshah, Luristan, Burujird, Khamsa, and the Bakhtiari country are important breed ing districts. There may be 3,000 or 4,000 mules sold out of these districts annually. Usual type that of small transport animal averaging 12 to 13 hands, 53 or 54 inch girth. Average price 10 ) ears ago krs. 300 to krs. 400 (8/. to 11/.). Prices now range from krs. 400 to krs. 1,000 or more, average being krs. 600 to krs 700 (ul. to 13/.). Sheep and Oxen. Export.— Sheep and oxen are sent to Transcaucasia from Azerbaijan, sheep being brought down even from Kurdistan. At least 45,000 to 60,000 head of sheep are exported, of a value of not less than 25,000/. to 30,000/. Transcaspia also is supplied from Khorassan with live-stock to the value, say, of 30,000/. per annum. Animal Intestines. Export— These are chiefly sheep and goat. A small trade exists from Bushire to Germany. Tabriz market disposes of somewhat larger quantities. The demand for this article is chiefly from America and Germany. Value at Tabriz is about krs. 750 (13/. 13s.) per 1,000 (of 28 metres).

Arms and Ammunition. Import prohibited, except under special permission.— Weapons of British make are, however, much appreciated. There was for a time a brisk and profitable trade in percussion caps imported through Tabriz for Afghanistan and Bokhara. The price has fallen from krs. 2,150 to krs 1,400 per case. Beverages. Beer. Import. —Teheran is the only market. English or Continen tal beer cannot be delivered at prices to compete with Russian beer. Liqueurs^ Spirits, Wines. Import.— The consumption of wines, whisky, and liqueurs is limited to foreign residents and occasional entertainments by Persian officials, and for the most part these liquors are imported direct by the private consumer. There is a somewhat greater consumption of inferior brandy, chiefly from Russia and Greece. Native wine and arrack find an extensive but clandestine sale in the large towns such as Teheran, Tabriz, and Ispahan. Export.— None. The vine flourishes in most parts of Persia, and the vintages of Shiraz, Ispahan, and Haraadan are renowned in the country, but wine making for export has not been attempted. Butter, Clarified. Ghee (Pers. Kogan). . Import.- Has been largely imported to Gulf ports from India during the last few years on account of drought in Southern Persia but is usually an article of export from Bushire. Large quantities are consumed in the fishing fleets of the Gulf. Value at Bushire Sa to 9 krans per Bushire man (7*7 lbs.) (5^. per lb.). Candles (Composite). . Import— The demand for candles is declining on account of the increased use of petroleum lamps. The import, via the Gulf is chiefly of Belgian and Dutch candles. A class of candles of Bntisn Indian origin has been introduced recently with success ' Hard candles with a high melting point are desirable to resist the heat of the Gulf.

Import.—Russian flour from Astrakhan is largely imported into Ghilan which does not grow wheat, and to a smaller extent to the Teheran and Tabriz markets as an article of luxury, being ■ whiter and better milled than local flour. Indian flower has for some years been largely imported into Gulf ports, but this must be looked on as a temporary trade only arising from a succession of bad years in Southern Persia caused by draught and locusts. Bushire, wanting in water power for local mills, is supplied from India. Linseed. Export— Grown for export in the Bushire and Ram Hormuz regions. Is difficult to clean, being often purposely mixed with dirt to add to weight. Value Bushire, krs. 18 to krs. 30 per Hashem man (say 8s. per cwt.). Value Ahwaz, uncleaned, krs. 13 to krs. 14 per Ram Hormuz man (say 5s. 6d. per cwt.). Millet and Sesame. Export— Bushire and Dizful. Little grown. Rice. Import.— Rice is-grown in Central and Southern Persia in sufficient quantities for home consumption, excepting the Gulf littoral, which takes modest supplies of Indian rice. &amp; The large imports of recent years are due to a succession of bad harvests in Southern Persia. There is, however, at all times a very important rice trade from India to Bahrein and the Arab coast of the Gulf, a part of which passes through Lingah in transit, and does not figure in the Persian Customs Statistics. Export.— From Mazanderan and Ghilan to Russia. This is an important trade, the exports for 1902-03 amounted to 740,000 cwts., value 268,000/. Prices may be quoted: inferior rice, krs. 1*3 to krs. 18 per Tabriz man (95. 4^. per cwt.), middle quality, krs. 2*6 to krs. 3 (175. 6d. per cwt.). For further information reference may be made to the Consular Report on the Resht district for 1902-03, “Annual Series,” No. 3109. Wheat. Import. —The large imports of recent years to Gulf ports are due to a succession of bad harvests in Southern Persia. Export.— In seasons of agricultural prosperity wheat has usually been exported from Bushire and Ahwaz to Great Britain. The plains north of Bushire and along the Karun are excellent i ■ jREPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. wheat lands. The return is estimated at 10 times the seed sown, but the ground is little more than scratched, and is cropped year after year. There is often a large percentage of barley mixed with the wheat, which is dealt in at Ahwaz on the basis of 8 per cent, barley and dirt. In consequence of a succession of bad harvests, prices have not admitted of important purchases for abroad since 1895, when over 25,000 tons were exported. This year a small quantity has been exported. The prices on the Karun in 1902 averaged about 7s. per cwt. It cannot be dealt in at Ahwaz for export at current London prices (March 1902, 27s. 6d.) at much over krs. 30 per Ismailia man (3J cwts.) (35. id. per cwt.). The province of Kermanshah is also an important wheat growing country, and, like the Karun region, might attain to agricultural prosperity were the excessive taxes and restrictions on export removed. The price of wheat in Kermanshah during the last year has been krs. 20 to krs. 25 per kharwar Tabriz, or 15. 2fl?. to is.’jd. per cwt. Customs duty on export is krs. 10 per kharwar (75^. per cwt.). The local governor has been in the habit of levying an altogether unjust and illegal tax of krs. 5 per kharwar (3^. per cwt.) on all grain moved out of the province, whether to other provinces or abroad. Charcoal. A small export to Baku from Resht. Clothing. Import.— Underclothing, such as socks, undervests, and drawers of all qualities both in wool and cotton, for both men and women’s wear, cotton and flannel shirts, &amp;c., is finding favour with the middle and upper classes in the larger towns. Teheran is the best market, and is supplied largely from Tabriz through Persian traders with Constantinople. A large proportion of these articles are of British origin. Cotton blankets (imitation wool), known as Austrian blankets, obtain a fairly wide sale (price Tabriz krs. 4 to krs. 6 per piece). Ladies’ wearing apparel, bonnets, muffs, and general millinery find a limited market in Teheran only. Handkerchiefs (printed) for women’s headgear find a fairly wide sale. An increasing demand for boots and shoes (men and women’s) of European shape is noted. Walking boots appear to come chiefly from Austria, long riding boots (chakmeh) from Russia, and fancy, shoes and slippers from France. Rubber goloshes from Russia are much used. The underclothing imported is said to be largely composed of odd lots and clearing sale goods picked up by traders on their annual visits to Europe, and traders state that prices are so precarious it is impossible to do business in regular lines. Export.-— Persian cloaks (abbas), socks, cotton shoes (givehs) gloves, handkerchiefs, &amp;c., are exported from Azerbaijan to Caucasia and Turkey, and find a market amongest the Muham- medan population in those regions.

Largely used for dyeing native and imported cotton textiles; also in the carpet industry. The bulk of the trade is in the inferior qualities. The trade is likely to suffer from the decay of the native printing and dyeing industries in Persia. Synthetic indigo is now employed to some extent. 44 Madder. Grown in Ispahan, Yezd, Shuster, and Kurdistan districts. Exported in small quantites from the Karun. There is also a small trade from Tabriz to Russia in madder and yellow berry. Fish. The valuable fisheries of the Caspian seaboard have been leased to the Russian firm of Lianozoff since 1888. This lease has been renewed from time to time, and is now terminable about 1925. The rental is at present some 18,000/. per annum, increasing in the latter years of the lease to 20,000/. per annum. This industry has not been safeguarded in the Russo-Persian Customs tariff against increase of duty in Russia. It is stated, however, that the Russian Government has decided to admit the products of these fisheries (caviare, sturgeon, salmon, &amp;c.), into Russia at rates equivalent to the former 5 per cent, ad ’valorem duties, and it is presumed this privilege will hold good up. to the termination of the existing contract between the Persian Govern ment and Lianozoff. There are important fishing interests on the Russian seaboard of the Caspian which would have profited from an increase of duty on Lianozoff’s Persian products. The more important fishing grounds are worked by the lessee. He sublets some of the smaller stations.20 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Number in Table of Statistics. 22 Fruits and Berries. Almonds.

Exported from Bunder Abbas to India, but the bulk of the trade is to Russia. The most important market is that of Tabriz, supplied from the vineyards of Maragha and Urmiah. The production of sultana raisins (sabzeh) has been most profit able in these regions, and new ground is being brought under cultivation continually. The production has greatly increased, perhaps, doubled, during the last 10 years. The trade is almost entirely in the hands of Armenians. The grapes, when ripe, are gathered, dipped in a solution of potash., dried for a few days, and then sorted and packed in boxes containing one poud net for the Russian market, or \ 2\ kilos, net for the European market. The Maragha raisins all go to Russia, whilst the Urmiah raisins, which remain clean, and do not cake together under packing, are more suited for the European markets. A Trebizond house has of late years taken considerable quantities of these raisins, probably for Germany and Britain. The price in krs.

Ten years ago the price of raisins in Maragha was krs, 5J to krs. 6 per poud. The price current in July 1903 was krs. 8 to krs. 10 per poud (say ios. 2d. per cwt.) Some 300,000 pouds of sultanas (sabzeh) are calculated to go out from Kazvin annually, average value about krs. 8-50 (35. id) per poud (gs. 6d. per cwt.), and some 100,000 pouds of plain dried raisins (mavis), aver age value, krs. 5 per poud (55. 8^. per cwt.), but these estimates of quantities appear too large. Expenses, Kazvin to Enzeli, are about krs. 3'5o per poud, Furniture. Import. —Very little cabinet work or upholstery is imported, as Persians do not furnish in European fashion. Large quantities of cheap glass lamps are imported, also brass and white metal candlesticks, all of which are classed as furniture, and pay duty at 5 P er cent, ad valorem under section 22, 2 {a) of the tariff. Superior lamps are imported from Austria and Britain. These and the immense variety of vases and fancy ware of metal and glass, or porcelain, from ash-trays to candelabra, which are imported, pay duty at 20 per cent, ad valorem under section 22, 2 [b). The several parts of such objects are now being sent out as much as possible in separate consignments as glassware, pottery, and metal, and are mounted at destination. See note under heading of Mercery and Hardware (p. 24). D 322 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Number in Table of Statistics. 70 33 Glass and Glassware. Wares of Glass. Large quantities of tea glasses are imported. from Russia, but the glass saucers for the same, and glass kalian (or water- pipe) bowls are imported from Austria and France. There is a fair trade in common wares, in which Britain does not compete. The bulk of the fancy glass trade is imported through Trebizond from Austria and France. Superior glassware, such as table services, dishes, goblets, &amp;c., find a market only in Teheran, and are chiefly French Baccarat ware. There is a fair consumption of glass sugar bowls, jugs, lamp-shades, lamp- glasses, and fancy ware, mostly from Austria. The decorative and artistic classes in these wares from Austria and _ France do not meet with serious competition, but in all the inferior classes, Russian wares are now displacing the others. There is said to have been a marked improvement in quality and finish of these Russian goods in recent years. See note under Mercery and Hardware (P. 24). Window Glass.

Tragacinth. Found in the districts of Shiraz, Yezd, Ispahan, Burujird, Kermanshah, Hamadan and Kurdistan. It grows wild on the hillsides, and the young plants give the best gum. The older plants give a yellow tinged gum, but if burnt down yield white juice from the stems. It has been questioned w'hether Persia can continue to yield the large quantities now exported of this article. The regions from which it is collected are, at any rate, very extensive. Price at Shiraz in March 1903, first quality, krs. 24 to krs. 28 per Shiraz man (say is. §d. per lb.) ; lowest, krs. 10 per man (5 per lb.).

There is a valuable trade in lamb skins to Russia, chiefly from Shiraz. The valuable skins, those which will retain after cleaning the natural close curl of the wool, are obtained only from the Arab flocks. The Kashgais cannot rear the same stock. The skins are collected by buying agents sent round the district, and are packed in bales of about 130 pairs. Price depends greatly on quality, it may average say krs. 20 per pair, but the finest skins are double that price. The skins of unborn lambs are reputed of finest quality, and this is said to give rise to maltreatment of ewes. Expenses of collecting, cleaning, packing, &amp;c., come to about krs. 2 per skin, transport to Moscow and Russian Customs to some krs. 3 per skin. Shiraz skins rank next to Bokhara skins in the Moscow market. Export from Ears, 6,000 to 8,000 bales per annum. Koweit also furnishes these skins, which are forwarded to Russia vid Bagdad and Kermanshah. In 1902 the price there was ^T8 per 100 skins. In the spring of 1903 it was ;£Ti6. In Bagdad, 1902, it was ^Tio, and in the spring of 1903, j£T 16 per 100. These skins all go to Astrakhan, where they are dressed. It seems there is no market for them, undressed, in Great Britain. There is a smaller trade of, perhaps, 20,000 skins from the Hamadan district, at an average price of krs. 10 per skin. They are also imported in some quantities from Afghanistan to Meshed, and exported thence to Russia. Leather. An important export to Russia, consisting chiefly of sheep apd goat skins tanned and dyed in Tabriz and Mamadan. Sorted in sizes, five skins to a bundle. Sheep skins, krs. 15 ($$• 5 ^-) t 0 krs. 23 (8s. 4^.) per bundle. Goat skins, krs. 15 (5.?, 5^.) to krs. 32 (1 u. 6^.) per bundle. Hamadan skins a little more than these prices. Rough tanned skins for covering bales and cases, krs, 8 to krs. 10 per bundle (about 3s. 3^.). Sables, Fox Skins, &amp;c. There is a trade of some krs. 300,000 to 400,000 per annum in fox and sable skins from the Shiraz district to Russia. Fox skins, krs. 5! (2s.) to krs. 7 {2s. 6d.) each, according to quality. Fox skins are also exported from Azerbaijan to Russia to the extent of 20,000 to 25,000 skins per annum ; they are worth krs. 10 (35. ^jd.) to krs. 11 (45.) per pair, and sell in Russia at Rbls. 3 to Rbls. 4 per pair. From Tabriz about 5,000 or 6,000 sable skins are exported annually to Russia; price, krs. 20 to krs. 30 per skin. The weight is about 100 skins to the poud, and Russian duty on import is Rbls. 75 per poud. Sables in Shiraz are quoted at krs. 12 (45. 2d.) to krs 22 (8s.) per skin. The export through Kazvin from Central Persia is estimated at 100,000 fox and 10,000 sables. Fox, krs. 8 per pair ; sables, krs. 22 per pair. The sable here referred to is the Mustela Martis (dalak). See Schindler’s “ Eastern Persian Irak, ” page 40. There are a few other skins such as wolf skins, krs. 4 to krs. 5, and hare skins, exported in small quantities. Instruments, Musical and Scientific. The demand is exceedingly limited, and there is no opening for regular business. D 4Number in Table of Statistics. 29 4 Report on trade of Persia. Machinery, Implements, &amp;c. For agricultural machinery, implements, &amp;c., there is positively no demand. Reaping machines, even scythes, are unknown, and would be unsuitable for the small irregular patches in which irrigated land has to be worked. Ploughs, harrows, sickles, shovels, picks, and hoes in use in the agricultural districts are all of primitive Eastern type. Industries seem fated to disaster in Persia, and ventures in sugar, yarns, gas, matches, and pottery, have stopped work. The mint imported new machinery from Belgium a couple of years ago. Electric lighting machinery has been imported recently to Teheran and Tabriz. Some drying furnaces for cocoons have been imported to Resht. In smaller articles stocking knitting machines sell well, and sewing machines are reported to be sought after. Matches. Austrian matches in round boxes still have the largest sale in Persia, being imported vid Trebizond, and generally used in North-Western and Central Persia, including Teheran, Ispahan, and Hamadan. Russian safety matches find an increasing market in Tabriz, Teheran and Khorassan. The Russian Customs allow a refund of excise of Rs 2 50 per case of 1,000 boxes on export to Persia. Swedish safety matches imported via the Gulf, in cases of 50 gross, which are divided into two for mule transport, find markets as far north as Ispahan and Teheran. The case of 25 gross in Shiraz, March 1903, was quoted krs. 120 to krs. 130 (555. 6d.), Mercery and Hardware. The multifarious wares which fall under this class are mostly imported from Russia and Austria. Enamelled iron ware is chiefly of Russian origin, and in Khorassan was reported better than the ware imported from India. This ware is not greatly sought after by the peasants, who prefer earthenware. The demand in Teheran and some of the large towns for ironmongery of the class of plain (rim, not mortise) locks, hinges, bolts, and door and window fastenings suitable for double doors and windows with very light frames is increasing. A great many of the articles under this heading are imported in small lots by traders returning from Russia, India, or Europe, and prices are reported to be very capricious. Cutlery, British knives, pen-knives, scissors, &amp;c., have a high reputation, but are undersold by cheap German and Austrian goods. The market for table cutlery is limited, as these articles are not used in Persian houses.

Iron from India and Swedish iron are imported by the Gulf, but the demand is largest in Teheran and the northern provinces, and is supplied from Russia. A good deal of scrap iron from Bakou is imported. Prices, Teheran, bars, rods, &amp;c., according to quality, krs. 3 to krs. 5, cash, per Tab. man (about is. $\d.) ; sheet iron, Russian, krs. 4*20 to krs. 5, cash, per Tab. man (about is. 8^.). There is a fair demand for sheet tin used for making samovars, canisters, and utensils of all sorts, and for lining cases. A curious use to which it is put in country places is in window frames instead of oiled paper. Price, Teheran, for plates 17^ inches by 12^ inches, krs. crSo per sheet (3^.). In Teheran sheet iron, usually obtained from kerosine cases, is much used for roofing. 1 he use of thin zinc sheets from Russia for roofing is growing in Teheran, the first cost being greater than kerosine-case sheets, but the latter have to be painted every two or three years. Price, Teheran, for zinc sheets in rolls, krs. 30 per Tab. man (105. 11^.). There might be an opening for some corrugated iron roofing material if price lists, &amp;c., showing cost at Teheran, were available to builders, as the increasing cost of heavy roofing timber is an inducement to adopt anything lighter than the usual flat mud roofs, which have to be repaired every three years. The zinc sheeting from Russia has to be soldered all along, and, being light, tends to strip in heavy gales. Bar silver is now imported in very small quantities, for silver smiths’ work in Shiraz, Ispahan, Teheran, and Zanjan. The heavier kran-pieces amongst the old coinage used to be melted down for this work. Block tin (“ kal') is used all over the country for whitening copper cooking utensils ; the chief markets are Ispahan and Hamadan. 3 ' Minerals. Some 3,000 to 4,000 tons of red oxide of iron are exported from Ormuz yearly. The market is said not to take more than this quantity. It is shipped under contract with one of the regular lines of steamers to the Gulf. There are about 150 men employed on the Island, and the ore is delivered on board by boats from a small jetty at, it is said, 1/. per ton. Cost of mining and shipping probably do not exceed 55. per ton. It was stated in Bunder Abbas (the statement requires confir mation) that the salt mines of Kishm employ some 2,000 hands. The salt is exported in sailing vessels to Muscat and Calcutta. It is locally estimated to cost about krs. 5(15. gd.) per 100 mans delivered on board. When the writer was in Bunder Abbas in March 1903 work was suspended, as the duty under the new tariff prohibited export. The oxide of iron mines of Ormuz and the salt mines of Kishm are worked under a monopoly, for which krs. 20,000 per annum is paid to the Persian Government. This monopoly expires in about two years’ time. 26 Oil. Olive. See Olives (p. 20). Petroleum. Imported from Russia. For years past the coast ports from Aden round the Gulf to Karachi have been supplied by a Bombay firm, who ship by their own steamers. The price has risen from krs. 10 to krs. 20 per case of two tins =65 lbs.26 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Number in Table of Statistics, 26 37 Opium. percentages of morphia. In Ispahan the crop occupies the ground from November to June, after which the ground can be used tor some other autumn crop. Opium is an expensive and somewhat precarious crop to grow, needing much labour, manure, and irri gation, and is frequently damaged by hail or rain, whilst the price is subject to wide fluctuations, being entirely dependent on the China and London markets. It is said to be often grown only because it can be readily disposed of for cash to meet rent and taxes, and not for the superior profit compared with other crops. Three mans of raw opium will produce about 2 mans of prepared opium. The cost of preparing 12^ Shah mans is about krs. 60, and the price of prepared opium in September 1903 was krs. 120 to krs, 125 per Tab. man (about 6s. 10#. per lb.). It is exported in tin-lined cases containing 140J- lbs. net (for China). 1 he charges from Ispahan to Bushire are about krs. 40 per case (14s. 6d.) f and by direct steamers, Bushire to Hong Kong, Rs. 20 per case, including Rs. 5 for transhipment at Bombay ; Bushire to London, 35s. per case. The export duty is about krs. 43 ° ( 7 ^* ^•) P er case. Opium is an article which lends itself readily to adulteration. The substance most frequently added is a native resin (gunjideh). So largely has this resin been used that its price has risen from krs. 5 to krs. 30 per Shah man. The heavy export duty now levied on opium will tend to lessen adulteration. Orders have been received from China for consignments of the resin gunjideh, presumably for purposes of adulteration at that end. T. he annual production of opium is estimated roughly at y,ooo cases, of which about 2,000 are consumed in the country. For home con sumption the opium is worked into sticks, not cakes. Hamadan accounts for 500 cases, Kermanshah 15*^ tc&gt; 200, and Meshed for 500 cases, the remainder coming from the central provinces of Ispahan, Shiraz, and Yezd, and also the Burujird district. This estimate, at least, agrees with the statistics for 1902-03, which show an export of a little over 5,000 cases. It is not generally thought that the increase of export duty (from 5 to about 14 per cent, ad valorem ) will restrict the cultivation of this drug, which has been produced in past years under very wide fluctuations of price. It is regretted, however, by thoughtful persons that the tax has not been made to fall on the growing consumption of the drug in the country instead of on its export. Packing Materials. Gunny-bags from India are imported in large quantities for grain, gum, and almond exports, and, in Ispahan, for cotton. Used bags in which grain and rice have been imported are also brought in considerable quantities from the Arab coast and Bahrein, and these are sold in Bushire at low prices.PRINCIPAL ARTICLES OF COMMERCE. 27 Number in Table of Statistics. 38 f 3 ° r 39 45 55. ! 7 f 5° Paper.

There are valuable fisheries on the Persian coast above Lingah, which have been allowed to rest for the last few years Lmgah is second to Bahrein as a pearl market, as food supplies for the fish- ; n „ fleets are transhipped there. The pearls are all bought up by Indian dealers. Mother-of-pearl shells, mussel shells, and oyster shells are brought in, and are exported to Britain, Germany, and latterlv Russia. Some attention is now being directed in the Gulf to these valuable articles, but only a small part of the take of these shells is brought to market, as the boats cannot carry them for more than a S few days before running to port. Oyster shells used to be sent from Bahrein to Bushire, but are now shipped direct. Perfumes. Imports are insignificant. Shiraz exoorts rose water to India in flasks and jars. The roses are steeped in water, and boiled. The water is then twice distilled. Attar of rozes, a concentrated form, is only made to order. Pottery. Earthenware from Russia (tea-cups, saucers, bowls, and D ] a tes) is found south as far as Shiraz and Bushire. Russian tea- oots are found everywhere, and the trade is a very big one. For merly these articles were imported from other European countries but It equal prices the Russian is now the superior article. These Russian^wares are now imported by the Gulf ports. The cost of transport on heavy and fragile merchandise puts British trade vut Trebizond at a disadvantage, but this should not be so in the Shiraz and Ispahan markets. Provisions. A small market exists for tinned meats, cheese, biscuits, jams, &amp;c bir only in Teheran, and chiefly among members of the European community, who, moreover, are largely supplied on private indents.

This import trade is entirely an Indian one, and is steadily growing. The chief articles are pepper, cinnamon, cardamoms, turmeric, tamarinds, and ganger. Sugar. The consumption of sugar in Persia has greatly increased in recent years. The Consular Reports for Bushire show an import at Bushire and Bunder Abbas for the two yeais 1897-98 of 251,500 cwts., and for the two years 1901-02 of 504,000 cwts. Kerman- shah also shows an increasing trade in French sugar. Russian sugar has made still greater progress; the export to Persia for 1902 stood at 3,000,000 pouds. There has been a decrease by the Trebizond route of some 20,000 cwts. of French sugar, which has almost ceased to be imported to Azerbaijan since 1900. Sugar cannot be insured inland, as it is a risky commodity to transport, being easily demaged by wet. The inland trade is chiefly in the hands of Persian merchants, and, as the article has a wide sale on which a quick turnover can be made, the profits in Persia are small. It is not possible, from evidence obtainable in Persia, which is only one out of several markets for Russian sugar, to express an authoritative opinion on the effect of the fiscal measures in Russia governing the production and export of this commodity. A lead ing exporter describes the system shortly as follows:—Sugar in Russia maintains a level of about Rbls. 6 per poud.' A Govern ment estimate is made of each year’s consumption, and of the stocks to be held m reserve, and this quantity is apportioned amongst the refineries in proportion to their declared output. Each refinery has then practically to sell abroad the quantity of its surplus output so established. There is a drawback on export ed sugar of Rbls. 1*75 per poud, which is the full tax imposed on production. Anyone entitled to trade abroad can export sugar and claim the Customs certificate for drawback, which shows the quantity exported and the refinery the sugar came from. As the refineries have to produce Customs certificates in proof of export, they have either to export on their own account or buy up certifi cates from those who have exported. These certificates conse quently often command a heavy premium, and are dealt in on the Bourse. The result of the existing conditions of production and export, as regards Persian trade, is that Russian sugar commands the markets of Azerbaijan, Zanjan, Hamadan (price krs. 4*75 per Tab. man—3-2^. per lb.), Korn, Shahrud and Mazanderan (price, Meshed, krs. 4 per Meshed man—2*55^. per lb.), and competes with French •sugar in Ispahan, Yezd, and Seistan. Consignments have been tried by the Russian steamers to Bushire and Shiraz, but have not been appreciated, on account of hard quality, though offered at krs. 4 to krs. 4*25 per Shiraz man. Russian sugar exported to Persia enjoys a rebate on freight of about 9 copecks per poud.39 Number in Table of Statistics. 5 * Principal articles of commerce. Yaltouchewsky sugar at Kief is quoted :— Small loaves in cases, Rbls. 2*75 to Rbls. 3*05 per poud. In August 1903, Rbls. 2 S5 per poud. Small loaves in bags, Rbls. 2*70 to Rbls. 3 per poud. In August 1903, Rbls. 2*80 per poud. Large loaves in bags, Rbls. 2*65 to Rbls. 2-95 per poud. In August 1903, Rbls. 2'75 per poud. Soft sugar in bags, Rbls. i'9oto Rbls. 2’10. Kisselowsky sugar at Kieff is quoted 10 copecks higher per poud, but commands 1 to 2 shahis better price in Tabriz on account of its harder quality. The cost of transport from Kieff to Erivan is 45 to 50 copecks per poud ; from Erivan to Julfa 20 to 50 copecks (in August 1903, 45 to 50 copecks) per poud ; and from Julfa to Tabriz 20 to 60 copecks (in August i9°3&gt; 35 4° copecks) per poud Porterage, commissions Erivan Julfa, and petties, say 10 copecks per poud.

Latterly it has been packed in bags, which saves packing and weight, and in which it is found to carry better. It holds the markets of the Gulf, Kerman, Shiraz (price krs. 5 to krs. 5*25 per Shiraz man), Ispahan, and the Kermanshah and Kurdistan districts, but has been almost driven out of Hamadan by Russian sugar (French, krs 5-10 per Tab. man (315. 6d. per cwt.) ; Russian, krs. 4*75 per Tab, man (295. 6d. per cwt.). It has been driven out of the Azerbaijan market, but when transport from Trebizond to Persia rules very low, it is still bought in that place (where important stocks are held) for the Khoi and Urmiah market. Some Belgian sugar has been taken in the Karun district. Sugar is much retailed by the loaf, and the Belgian loaf of the same weight as the French is a little more tapered in the cone, stands higher, and thus looks bigger. In the markets accustomed to French sugar, the hardness of the Russian article is objected to, but in the north, where they have become accustomed to this quality, they drink tea whilst holding a morsel of .sugar in the mouth, and on account of this habit find a defect in more soluble sugar. Soft Sugar. Almost the whole of this trade to the Gulf is from Austria. The sugar is imported in bags at ns. 6d. to 12s. per cwt. c. i. i. Gulf ports for crystallized, which has displaced the slightly cheaper granulated variety. The latter is said to be more liable to sweat on the voyage. Austrian crystallized sugar holds the markets in the Gulf and Karun regions and in Shiraz, where it sold in March 1903 at krs. 3 50 per Shiraz man (21*. iod. per cwt.); also in Kermanshah, which, however, takes only a small quantity. All the northern provinces down to Hamadan, Ispahan, and Yezd take Russian sugar. Prices in Hamadan, krs. 3*10 to krs. 3*20 per Tab. man (19$. 6d. per cwt.); Ispahan, krs. 7-25 to krs. -8-50 per Shah man (245. 6d. per cwt.) ; Meshed, krs. 3 per Meshed man (18s. 4^. per cwt.). Mauritius and Batavian sugars are too expensive for the Persian market. The average quantity landed at Bunder Abbas and Bushire for the five years ending 1900 was 46,100 cwts. per annum, and the average quantity for the two years, 1901*02, 40,800 cwts. per annum, to which may be added for the Seistan route, not pre-Report on trade of Persia. j^aaisr^BatrBu 1 !: average number of cases for &lt; nnn um and the average the five years ending .900 was 8 ’ 7 °° P e ”“se of 700 casfs. for 1Q01-02, 0,400 per annum, showing an increase u y trade with Persia is distinctly growing. rrvn The Customs Statistics for the last three years tend to con- firm this:— Krs. 12,300,000 13,000,000 i 4 , 3 oo , o0 ° Total imports, year March 1900-01 1901- 02 1902- 03 (Exclusive of Muhammerah.) A part of the tea formerly landed at Bunder Abbas was destined for Transcaspia, a market no longer supplied by Pers a r ° Ute The traders in Persia interested in this line do not appear to ontirioate any great reduction in the consumption of tea on account of the heavy duties imposed under the Tariff o 1903. Also although Indian tea is more heavily taxed m proportion to vaS than white-tipped China and java teas the relative prices to the consumer will hot be so much changed as to bring these fatter into competition with the cheap Indian tea. The duty under the Tariff of 1903, equivalent to quite 75 per cent, ad valorem on low class Indian tea, will hamper the operations of traders with small capitals, who must now invest almost double the amount ot capital to carry on the same business as formerly. The Customs Statistics for 1902-03 show an export of over 0000 cases to Russia from Azerbaijan and Khorassan—unexpect- ed routes for a transit trade to follow ; yet the actual export is locally estimated at nearly double these figures. The reason, of course is that tea which in Tabriz or Meshed costs 6 S copecks per lb. is worth Rbls. 1 '40 over the Russian border if it can be got It was simpler to pay the olds per cent, export duty m Persia than to run the risk of capture on that side of the frontier. The Customs’ cordons on the Russian frontier have been more effective of late in stopping this contraband trade. Russia has recently opened the Batoum-Julfa and Batoum- Ashkabad routes to tea in transit for Persia. Any agent can be employed. Tea for Azerbaijan and Khorassan ought to arrive much cheaper by these routes than by the Gulf. The Russo-China Bank offered the following conditions To effect purchases in China or India on indent, charging 6 per cent, interest on invoice cost and charges to date of arrival in Batoum—to advance the deposit on account of duty (Rbls 31*50 per poud) during transit, at a com mission of 1 per cent.—to effect transport from Batoum to Tabriz at about Rbls. i *45 P er P oud ( this rate subject to variation of 10 to 15 copecks per poud according to rates of wagon hire Erivan-Tabriz), and insurance at Rbls. 4*50 per Rbls. 1,000 ; interest on advances at 8 per cent, from arrival at Batoum to date of payment in 'p a b r i z _ c ommission 1 per cent, on cost and charges to Batoum. The Banque d’Escompte de Perse are reported to have offered to effect purchases on indent for Meshed, advancing cost, charges, and deposit of duty, at the rate of 6 per cent, interest till payment in Meshed, the tea to be taken up within three months of arrival ; their commission to be 1 per cent.

Indian Tea. . fndian.tea forms quite 80 per cent, of the total imports of tea into Persia, and the bulk of it may be valued at 5 to 4 annas per lb. c.i.f. Gulf ports. It is the only tea consumed by the peasantry and lower classes, and is sold all over the country. In Hamadan, where it had been selling before the introduction of the Tariff of 1903 at krs. 11 to krs. 12 per Tab. man, the price has risen to krs. 16 to krs. 17. The teas most widely consumed in Teheran range at present from krs. 20 to krs. 25 per Tab. man, cash. China Tea. This forms about 8 per cent, only of the total tea imports. It is chiefly “ white,” that is with leaves of white or greyish colour. The demand is for better class teas, averaging about \s. 2d. per lb., c.i.f. the Gulf. The consumption is amongst the upper classes in the larger towns, such as Shiraz, Ispahan, Teheran, and Meshed. The annual consumption in this last market is estimated by a local dealer at 5,000 to 6,000 cases of Indian, 200 cases of China, and 300 cases of Java. The ruling price in Teheran for white tea is krs. 36 per Tabriz man, cash. Batavian Tea. The consumption of this variety is somewhat less than that of China tea. Batavian tea also comes chiefly under the class of white tea, or tea possessing a percentage of silver or grey- tipped leaves. The chest of 130 lbs. contains eight boxes. As a type, “ No. 22 ” quality, costing about 92*. c.i.f. the Gulf, may be cited. Batavian tea competes with Chinese as abetter class article for the upper classes. The best markets are Teheran and Tabriz. In the Meshed market it was selling, in August 1903, at krs 6 to krs. 6 30 per lb. ; Teheran krs. 35 to krs. 38 per Tabriz man, cash. Russian Tea.

(Samples are sent with this report, as it may be interesting to know whether this is Indian or China tea.) The Russian Customs allow a drawback of 80 copecks per funt on tea exported to Persia. Very little is taken by Khorassan, and the imports to Azerbaijan are decreasing. A large quantity appears to have been imported last year for Teheran.

The manufacture of carpets is carried on in many parts of Persia, but naturally centres in those districts where wool, grain, and consequently labour are abundant and cheap. Kerman carpets have a high reputation, and command in Constantinople the highest prices of all Persian carpets. In Tabriz the industry has been inaugurated only in recent years, but has made great strides, and the carpets produced there are of fine workmanship and fetch high prices ; the peculiarly soft fine wool of Meshed and Khorassan give these carpets also a superior value. The region centring in Ferahan and Sultanabad produces very large quantities of carpets of all grades, although the bulk of the business is in ordinary grades for domestic use. Hamadan, Kurdistan, and Pars also produce many carpets. Pars and Kur distan weave heavy all-wool carpets. Carpets are exported from Shiraz to Egypt and Constantinople from the Gulf. Some Kerman carpets are sent to the same markets from Bunder Abbas, but the bulk of the carpets from that district, as well as from Central and Western Persia, are either consigned or sold to Tabriz for the Constantinople market, whence they are distributed to all parts of the world. There is very keen competition amongst Persian traders in the Constantinople market, and export houses in Tabriz are endeavouring to increase direct trade with America, the best buyer. Tiflis is also a market for Persian carpets, taking from Tabriz mostly lower grade carpets from Kurdistan and Ferahan. Khorassan carpets can be exported to Tiflis and Constantinople vid Ashkabad. From Tabriz to Constantinople the Trebizond route used to be employed, but the Julfa-Erivan route in transit through Russia is now preferred. There are, or were, certain restrictions in respect of old (used) carpets. Railway freight from Erivan to Batoum is 60 copecks per poud, and Russian transport companies in Tabriz (August 1903) were offering through freight and insur ance all risks, Tabriz to Batoum, at Rbls. 1-45 per poud. Kurdistan Hamadan, and Ferahan carpets are also exported via Kermanshah and Bagdad, but the delay and inconvenience occasioned by Customs formalities in Turkish territory are a deterrent to the use of this route. Persian carpets are all made on hand looms, the pile being knotted on by hand. The bulk of woollen carpets have a woollen pile only, warp and woof being cotton. Some are all wool. In silk carpets the woof is usually cotton, the warp either silk or cotton.Number in Table of Statistics. 61 PRINCIPAL ARTICLES OF COMMERCE. 33 The Ferahan district, in which Sultanabad lies, produces only some 60 to 80 kharwars of wool, and supplies have long been drawn from the Khoncharand Ispahan districts, and now regularly trom Kermanshah also. The disturbed state of Luristan forbids the import of fine wool grown in the Shuster regions. The wool is usually imported in the form of yarn, the local population being more profitably employed in weaving. Wool, 10 years ago, was at krs. 16 per Shah man, now it is at krs. 30 to 32. In carpet making about 25 per cent, of the yarn is lost in clippings, which are valueless. The yarn employed must be good white wool; brown or dark wool can be dyed only to dark colours—-even for reds the white wool is needed. The increased duty on indigo under the Tariff of 1903 will not materially affect carpet making, as the cost of dyeing is not a large factor in the price of carpets &amp; The bulk of the carpet industry is carried on in the weavers’ homes, the women and children doing the weaving. The so-called manufacturer supplies to the weaver the design and the quantities of wool in different colours required for one carpet. (This latter, to ensure the same shades being employed throughout.) He also advances sums to account of the price arranged, the balance beino- paid on delivery of the finished article. The practice has the usual disadvantages of home employment, slovenly and dilatory work, with little progress towards skill and finish, as the looms scattered over a wide area, cannot be constantly inspected. The vast majority of weavers, however, living in small isolated villages and having also household duties, can work only in this way! The untrustworthy weaver sells the good wool entrusted to him and substitutes inferior wool, and sometimes even sells the finished work and sets up a new piece, to be delivered long after contract time. There is only one European (British) house now competing with Persians m carpet weaving. Their method of business is as indicated above. They usually employ some 3,000 looms, on which, perhaps, 10,000 hands are kept at work. Much local experience is needed in placing out work according to the skill and trustworthiness of the weaver. They purchase and dye in their own premises all the wool employed in their carpets. Of course, the wholesale and export traders buy great numbers of carpets made for small capitalists, or by weavers who can afford to lie out of the cost of material and labour till finished. A manufacturer with long experience of the industry in Sul tanabad considers that it would not be difficult to get women weavers to attend at a properly appointed factory, and that the economy of material, and increased skill and finish of supervised work, would enable such an undertaking to prosper. Jn Tabriz, where carpet making is quite a recent industry, the weaving is done by boys who attend at the factories. Wages are about krs. 12 per month, and the midday meal say another krs. 12 per month. There is a foreman, say at krs. 50 per month. A carpet of 9 feet by 12 feet with 15 by 15 stitches to the square inch will employ say 5 boys and an overseer. The rate of progess will depend on the intricacy of the design, say about 18 square feet per month. The Tabriz carpets have attained a reputation for good workmanship, but the local wool coming chiefly from Khoi, Urmiah, and Soujbulak is of a hard texture and makes the carpets stiff and unpliable. The quality depends greatly on the number of stitches. The coursest qualities turned out have about 8 by 8 stitches to the square inch. The average quality of Tabriz carpets runs about 15 by 15 stitches, and &amp; a fine carpet 20 by 20.3 Silk carpets certain from 15 by 15 to 22 by 22 stitches.

According to Bushire Consular Reports the average export at the Port of Bushire and Bunder Abbas for seven years ending iqoi was 11,000 cwts., and for the two years ending. 1902, 7,400 cwts. In 1900, however, the export was exceptionally large. The exports to Russia for the year 1889 canno we a exceeded 5 120,000 cwts., for 1898 they are given in the Russian Statistics as 261,000 cwts., and for the year ending March .902, according to Persian statistics, they amounted to 267,000 cwts. Persian cotton appears not to be good enough in quah y suit the Indian or home markets, and in the southern provinces 1 can hardly be grown at remunerative prices for export. Russia imposes a tax of Rbls. 4-15 per poud on cotton im ported over European and Black Sea frontiers, and of copecks 40' per poud on Persian cotton, a difference of Rbls. 3 75 per poud, or over 2M per lb. This is about equal to the cost of transport to Moscow from Kerman, perhaps the most distant Pf° v ‘'^ e fr °£ which cotton is exported to Russia. Russia can hardly be depend- ent for raw cotton on Persia, from which she draws only about 8 percent, of her total imports of that staple. However, 2 6 7 .oo 0 cwts or 827.000 pouds at Rbls. 3-75 amounts to over Rbls. , ,00 000. This difference in duty is sufficient to account for the prosperous, if somewhat dependent, condition of cotton growing in Persia, and for the complete absorption of the surplus crop by 11 SS 13 . • * * Khorassan is the most important cotton growing province in' Persia In Meshed, the chief market (August I 9 ° 3 )» the . rul ^g price was krs. 550 per Meshed kharwar (3*90^. per lb.); in the previous year it was krs. 850 (5l». per lb.).

British and British Indian trade in 1889 has been estimated at about 1,714,000/. Estimates made from Consular Reports give for the period *895-97 an annual import from the British Empire of about 1,626,000/., and for 1901-02 of about 1,670,000^. This last amount is some 15 per cent, more than the average obtained from the Customs Statistics for 1901-03 already quoted. In drawing conclusions from these statistics it should be observed that the Consular Reports in some instances appear to convert quantities into values at somewhat high rates, whereas Customs valuations (made for the calculation of duties payable ad 'valorem) are certain to be well within real value. Statistics show a great increase in the cotton textile trade in 1901 in imports from both Russia and the British Empire.

Consequently the Russian and Persian production may be, say, 120,000 tons per annum. ♦ Equivalent under existing Currency Law to 3 ‘ 45 i 3'6o and 4 , 2o Rbls. per poud.1 36 Number in Table of Statistics. 59 &gt; 60 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. If the Russian and Persian growers obtain the full benefit of the protective import duty, then all the cotton employed m Russian cotton factories is Rbls. 4-1 5 poud dearer than it would be were no import duty imposed. . Regarded from this point of view, since 100 lbs. of raw cotton produce only about 91 lbs. of prints, the drawback is little more than equivalent to the disability imposed in Russia on trade abroad by the Customs duty of Rbls. 4*15 on imported raw material. If, however, the quantities of raw cotton offered on the Russian market from Russian and Persian sources (although, as above noted, it is less than half the annual consumption of raw cotton in Russia) be greater than the demands of that market for the particular qualities produced by the Russian and Persian growers, then these growers must compete with one another for the supply of the requirements for Russian consumption, and so permit the manufacturers to gain some advantage from the draw* back. Dyeing materials also pay Customs duty in Russia, and the greater drawback on classes B and C is said to be equivalent to the tax on these materials, Evidence on this point is not available in Persia. 1 ♦ v 59 Bleached and Unbleached Cotton Tissues—White and Grey Shirtings, &amp;c.

Russia is now supplying both white and grey shirtings to Persia, and, though her trade is still small, she appears to be devoting atten tion to these goods. Her makes, so far, have not established a footing beyond the northern provinces of Azerbaijan, Teheran, and Khorassan, and even in these markets do not compete seriously with British goods. At equal prices their qualities are not good enough, and even in the Ardebil market are only taken freely when Hamadan prices are high. In Meshed also an importer stated that British whites at krs. 40 per piece were preferred to the Russian at krs. 30. Reports from Baku would seem to indicate that the Takief factory there, of which a good deal has been expected, is not able to produce these goods a$ remunerative prices. Holland has recently supplied, at prices to compete with British goods, both whites and greys, which have been appre ciated, and promise to secure for themselves a firm footing on the market. Persia also weaves plain tissues ( ,f karbaz ”) from home and imported cotton twist, but the extensive markets formerly found for these fabrics in such districts as Burujird, Kurdistan, and Soujbulak have been largely captured by imported Mexicans, and this formerly large trade is now of little account. The real competition in these goods is between rival British imports. Persian traders dealing mostly through Bombay supply the markets of Kerman, Yezd, and Khorassan by the Bunder Abbas route, although in Khorassan the trade in greys is reported to be shrinking, as this material, indigo dyed locally, is being displaced by cotton suitings and trouserings.* The Jewish and Persian traders of Kermanshah and Hamadan import goods on indents payable in Bagdad, or bought there, which they dispose of not only in their local markets, but to customers in Zanjan, Ardebil, Kazvin, Teheran, and Azerbaijan, as far as Tabriz, at times invading even Ispahan.

White and grey goods, on account of their lesser value than prints, weight for weight, pay a proportionately higher duty on value under the Tariff of 1903. The duty may be equivalent to from 8 to 11 per cent, act valorem, but the average would be about 8| per cent. Part of the weight is doubtless due to the heavy filling in these goods to give them an attractive and substantial appearance to the retail buyer, but to the uninitiated it is difficult to see why the “ chitsaz ” (Persian printer) pays freight and duty on filling for the marshes in which the Ispahan river loses itself._ Perhaps it has not been found worth while to bring out a special class of goods for this trade.

The nomads buy most in spring and autumn, the seasons for changing camp. White o- 0 ods are printed in many pleasing and intricate designs by the handblock 'I hese prints are seldom prepared in the piece for retail by the yard, but are printed as articles such as handkerchiefs napkins table-cloths, curtains, &amp;c. (the cloth being previously seamed to the desired width), or as material for undercoats, vests and linings &amp;c., in lengths for one garment. They are more’costly thin foreign machine-made prints, and are consumed by the middle and upper classes. For this reason they have, perhaps a market somewhat apart from that of foreign prints, but there is no doubt that the cheap and varied imports from abroad are steadily encroach ing on the home industry. J It seems certain that the heavier duty on white and m-ey goods (compared with that on prints), and on dyes, is a distinct blow to the already depressed printing and dyeing industries of Persia The trade in white and grey goods is &lt;till British, but in prints we must admit that foreign manufacturers almost divide the market with us. Therefore, our trade will suffer all the reduction in imports of white and grey goods, and may gain only half the increase in imports of the printed and dyed goods displacing them In this sense the Tariff of 1903 discriminates against British trade. The printer (“ chitsaz ”) buys from th$ importer or from the wholesale dealer (“ bonekdar ”) on credit, which will usually run for three or four months with the former and longer with the latter The process of printing may require two months, and the chitsaz sells his goods to the trader at ij to 2 months’ credit. 1 d' dyeing is a special branch of the trade usually carried on aparf° the other colours are hand-blocked by the printer.

Imported Prints. The great increase in Russian trade has been in prints, and particularly in red-ground prints. It seems that these red-ground prints are very widely used in Russia, which enables manufacturers to supply the wants of the export houses in a great variety of designs promptly, and at a minimum cost, from stock. Azerbaijan .—In Tabriz the decline in British imports is due to competition from Russia. Their red-ground prints, of which 1.200 bales or more may be imported, have driven out tin Manchester article. In other classes of prints the Russian com petition is also severely felt by importers of Manchester goods. In heavier goods, however, such as mixture coatings (fa9onne) trouserings, velvets, plushes, Russia is only beginning to establish a place. In velvets and plushes, &amp;c., the British manufacturer has to compete with German, and in cotton trouserings with Italian goods, whilst in high-class prints of superior finish, cretonnes, satinettes, Oxfords, French and Austrian goods find a steady market. British firms in Tabriz have to work against the Persian traders dealing through Constantinople, and, despite the intermediate profits to be piid there, Stamboulchis, as they are called, have always main tained a close competition. Kermanshah and Hamadan .—In Hamadan, Russian prints now appear in large quantities, and these are imported direct either from Resht or from Teheran, where superior facilities are obtain able in the matter of credit. The Russian imports are chiefly in prints of stock pattern, mostly of red-ground, and other dark goods. They now form, perhaps, one-fourth of the total trade. The villagers will pay 16 or 17 shahis per zar for Russian prints of stout material and fast colour in preference to British goods at 15 shahis. The imports from Manchester, through Bagdad, chiefly in the hands of Jewish traders, are losing reputation, as these traders are constantly lowering the quality of their goods, whilst Russian goods are kept steadily at the same quality and price. Russian competition has been much more felt since the Banque d’Escompte commenced to push trade by granting large credits on easy terms in Teheran. In light prints, red twills (a large trade), indigo-dyed shirtings^ muslins, gauzes, and cotton trouserings, &amp;c., the business is still British and British Indian In Kermanshah, Russian goods have been known for some five years now, but have not yet taken a strong hold on the market. Their goods are of better quality and more expensive than the main lines of British imports, and seem to find a special market. At equal qualities, however, their goods appear to be offered somewhat cheaper, perhaps 1 kran per piece, than British goods. Imports through Bagdad are mainly in the cheaper grades of Manchester prints, and the local markets, which extend to Burujird and Kurdistan, show no sign of contraction. At least 80 per cent, of the trade is in the hands of Jewish, traders.Number it Table of Stati sties. 59 PRINCIPAL ARTICLES OF COMMERCE. 39 India?* 6 qUantitieS of indi g°-dyed shirtings are imported from Under the heading of Bleached and Unbleached Tissues refer, ence is made to the manner in which these Mexicans n’hin nr regbns. ^ have dis P ,aced the home-made kerbaz in these /Carun.—The business in Muhammerah is largely in the hands whfrT tra 1 ders t dealln S much in odd lots and auctioned goods which can be placed on the market at low prices. ’ R J‘. may , b ® . not lced that previous to the establishment of the Bc'gian administration of the Customs, these fevvish traders combined in an arrangement with the Sheikh of Muhammerah to ^X'f.ooa S dUty ° n their imp ° rtS f ° r a yearIy lum P sum Persian Gulf.—lfo Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and, more recentlv Ahwaz routes supply Central Persia, Kerman, Yezd and Khorassan Perhaps ,o per cent, of the imports of’cotton tissues may be in fancy goods, such as tulles, plushes, &amp;c.: the rest are believed to be pretty equally divided between white and erev shirtings and dyed and printed tissues.

To-day that position has not only been reversed, but, as the consumption has increased. Russia now sends over 5,000 bales per annum. The average cost of these prints may be 95. 6&gt;d. per piece of 50 yards, 23 inches wide, c. i. f. Enzeli, or \os. gd. delivered in Teheran. The trade with Khorassan has been still more seriously reduced, and that with Yezd has equally suffered, as a great part of the piece goods taken to Yezd from Bunder Abbas or Ispahan was destined for Khorassan. . . .. This is a somewhat formidable list of markets formerly held by British prints and now encroached upon by foreign manufac tures. Yet our imports of these articles have certainly increased by the Bagdad route, and in Ispahan complaint seems rather of closer competition than of actual decrease of trade. Even in Khorassan our prints have not been altogether driven out of the field, and a few established makes are still imported ; that known as Seyd Abdul Khassemi, a six-coloured print, was quoted as a type. In Nishapur and Sabzwar, which are calculated to take nearly Rbls. 300,000 in value of Russian prints annually, the same information was still furnished that British prints of the better class are still in demand. In Shahrud a leading merchant ventured the opinion that perhaps one-fifth of the trade is still British. This town is on the line of communications with the Caspian at Bundar Gez, and sends Russian prints (red-ground) to Yezd. Other Coloured Goods, In dyed tissues, black and coloured linings and Italians, cotton suitings and trouserings, serges, flannelettes, &amp;c., the trade vtd the Gulf is in British hands, but statistics are not available to distin guish the values imported. Indigo dyed shirtings are largely used on the Gulf littoral, but are not appreciated inland, where home dyed goods are considered to be of faster colour. French, German, and Austrian goods, for the most part imported through Constantinople and Trebizond, have been already noticed amongst Tabriz imports. The Customs Tariff of 1903 is, on. the whole, favourable to printed goods. Some of the more delicate prints, rolled with a paper wrap on wooden boards, have to pay on the weight of these materials, as no allowance is made, and the goods would be damaged if unwound. In Kermanshah attention was drawn to a few lines of heavier goods, on which duty works out to more than the old 5 per cent, rate—such as a heavy-striped print (Tampush), about per cent.; a heavily-filled Turkey red twill, 8 per cent.; and a dyed cotton lining, 7 per cent. On the majority of printed and dyed goods, however, duty is somewhat less than the old 5 per cent, ad valorem, the average for the whole class working out to about 4J- per cent, on value. In every place visited a general comparison was invited as to the qualities of the Russian and British prints competing on the market, and the reply invariably furnished was that the Russian article at equal prices was stouter and more durable, with faster Numt Tab! Statis 5 : is 21 r\ i PRINCIPAL ARTICLES OF COMMERCE. 4* colours, and that these qualities were appreciated by the working class. Russian prints are manufactured of 23 to 25-inch width, the red-ground prints all at 23-inch. It is therefore difficult to com pare prices with British imports, and the retail buyer seems to make his choice between articles quoted at the same price per yard, roughly setting off the stouter material and reputed faster colouring of the Russian against the superior width of the British article. If the British manufacturer can reduce his price in direct proportion to width, it would be interesting to see an active importer try conclusions with Russian traders in their own widths. The Russian prints are largely imported in assorted bales containing a selection of different qualities, colours, and designs suited to the supposed needs of the retail trader. Thus, a manu facturer producing 14 qualities will pack these in fixed proportions into bales. The bale for Persia will consist of 20 pieces of 6p arshines each, or 1,200 arshines of assorted prints at an average value, Moscow, of, say, 12 copecks (less 14 per cent, discount) per arshine. The bale will weigh, say, 4 pouds net, on which the draw back will be at Rbls. 4- 87^, Rbls. 19*50, the expenses, Moscow to Tabriz, Rbls. 8, insurance 1 per cent., and Persian duty krs. 27. Specimen invoices of red-ground prints from Moscow to Tabriz and a description of the assortment of bales will be found in Annex I., pp. 88-89. Opinion is divided as to how this method of assortment will ultimately succeed in Persia. It is, perhaps, an advantage to an inexperienced retail dealer, and may thus help to f push new trade. British importers consider it quite unsuited to their business. Several importers have observed that it is difficult to get Manchester manufacturers to take orders for less than, say, 100 pieces of a particular article, whilst the Russian makers appear to execute orders for small quantities. They do not object to the loss of a small profit, but to the necessity of refusing to oblige a regular customer in respect of an article he is accustomed to have in stock. Local customs and usages in the textile trade are referred to in another Section of this Report, and a statement of the prices of goods will be found in the list of samples forwarded (pp. 68-69).

Total imports— £ Number in Table of Statistics. 59 1901- 02 ... ... 125,764 1902- 03 ... 98,919 The import of cotton sewing thread is surprisingly small, and is chiefly via Trebizond and Tabriz. Tabriz was formerly supplied from Great Britain, two firms alone disposing of some 250 to 300 cases per annum, but the market has now been taken by Germany, whose manufacturers sent out bobbins with 150 yards or less of thread, but of the same size as the British 200-yard bobbins. The Persian consumer did not at first understand the difference in number of yards, though correctly marked, and in any case preferred the smaller price. A British maker is now supplying reels marked at 150 yards, which are finding a market. There is only a small trade by the Gulf routes, the reason assigned in Ispahan being that most of the sewing is done with silk from Resht twisted locally by Jews The trade in cotton yarns is almost exclusively British and British Indian, and the imports are chiefly by Gulf ports. Azerbaijan imports direct vid Trebizond but also receives large quantities from Hamadan.

Their qualities are good, and they are made up in bundles weighing somewhat heavier than Manchester yarns.

The latter industry, how ever, in ^ Khorassan is reported to be losing ground, as cotton or mixed suitings and trouserings are taking the place of the plain home-made cotton tissues (kerbaz). In the Yez and Ispahan districts the weaving industry in cotton tissues is very extensive, though it is all house work, on cottage looms, and in articles of certain dimensions, such as kerchiefs napkins, shawls, scarfs, braids, tapes, cords, &amp;c. Cotton longcloth’ or kerbaz, has already been noted. ’ Yez also produces a thick cotton drugget, ' zeloo ” much used for carpeting. For all these purposes large quantities of Indian and Manchester twist are employed. Shuster has a local industry in cotton rugs (“gelims ”) and in coarse cloth, for W'hich Indian twist is imported.

(lbs. 14,566) in 1902-03; they are brought trom Asia Minor, French eggs not proving a success. Formerly hand-reeled and waste silk were largely exported to Constantinople and Marseilles; now the export trade is almost entirely in cocoons to Marseilles and Milan. Steam reeling works have been fitted up recently by a Persian merchant, and are reported to have succeeded, the silk commanding Broussa prices. The foregoing remarks are taken from the Consular Report above referred to, which contains much information on the subject. The average price for cocoons in 1903 has been krs. 33 per Shah man (13 lbs.), fresh. About 3 mans of fresh cocoons are equal to 1 man, dried. The cost of drying, sorting, cleaning, and packing is canvas bags may amount to about krs. 2 per man. ’ In consequence of the high prices offered this year it is reported that almost the whole production of cocoons has been exported, amounting to over 23,000 bales, or 1,500,000 kilos. In addition to the export trade there is a large consumption of reeled and waste silk in the country ; perhaps one-half of the production in ordinary years is forwarded to Tabriz, Kashan, Ispahan, Yezd, Kerman, Meshed, and vid Kermanshah to Bagdad*. There is also a considerable manufacture of coarse silk tissues in Ghilan. The Tabriz merchants formerly took a large share in the Resht export trade, but they are now cut out by the firms working on the spot and exporting vtd Batoum, There is still a consumption of Resht silk for carpet weaving, embroideries, &amp;c. The exports from Kermanshah are chiefly spun silk and waste silk for the Bagdad market, where many silk and mixed tissues, embroideries, &amp;c., are produced. Ispahan and Sultanabad import silk for the carpet industry ; Kerman for carpets and silk tissues of many sorts, kerchiefs, sashes, cloaks (abbas), and brocades. Kashan has long been famous for its varied silk tissues, from handkerchiefs to velvets, brocades, and carpets. In the Yezd, Kashan, and Urmiah districts silk is cultivated, but in much smaller quantities than required for local con sumption. Khorassan grows silk, particularly in the neighbourhood of Turbat, but not sufficient for the weaving industries, and much is imported from Resht. G 244 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Number in Table of Statistics. 30 , 5 ^ 65 55 Cocoons are worth krs. 30 to krs. 38 per man (of 6'8o lbs.) in Meshed. Five to six-and a-half mans of cocoons will yield one man of spun silk , worth krs 20c, and a quarter to one-third of a man of waste silk. The proceeds of sale of this waste silk about covers the cost of spinning. There are, perhaps, 500 hands employed in spinning in Meshed. The spinners pay a Government tax of krs. 10 per man of silk spun. The product is very inferior, as no care is taken with cocoons, and the discoloured are wound off along with the rest. Afghanistan takes a small quantity of spun silk from Meshed. In the neighbourhood of Sabzwar the mulberry grows freely, and worms are reared from imported eggs. Cocoons are ready in July. An Armenian firm has this year commenced to buy cocoons for export, and has obtained good white selected cocoons at krs. 45 per Tabriz man. The silk spun locally is very indifferent, white and coloured cocoons being mixed. China silk is sometimes imported for Shuster and Dizful weavers.

Import. —The principal market is Tabriz, and the trade is in the hands of Persian merchants dealing through Constantinople, and is often worked in conjunction with the woollen trade. The goods dealt in are chiefly of French origin; other goods do not appear able to compete with them in quality and finish at equal prices. In British goods, velvets and plushes find a market. Imports through Kermanshah and Bushire are of much less importance. These goods are mostly ordered in Great Britain, but the origin is less certain. There is a fair demand for silk goods for ladies’ wear and upholstery in the large towns. Teheran is the best market. For prices see Sample List, pp. 68—69. Export*—The silk tissues manufactured in Yezd and Khorassan are exported from the latter to Transcaspia, Afghanistan, and India. A larger trade in similar articles, handkerchiefs, shawls for turbans, and girdles, striped and coloured tissues, &amp;c., exists from Tabriz to Caucasia. These tissues, woven from inferior silk, may run from krs. 3 to krs. 10 per zar according to quality (is. to 3s. 6d. per yard). Import duties under the Tariff of 1903 are somewhat heavier than the old 5 per cent, duty, and may average, say, 7 per cent., but vary greatly. Export duty in Persia is removed, but the import duty in Russia has been raised to the equivalent of over :o per cent, ad valorem on Persian tissues. Textiles Wool, Raw. Import. —From Afghanistan to Khorassan. Export. —Occasional shipments are made from Bunder Abbas to Bombay, and from Bushire to Great Britain, but it is reported to be an unsatisfactory business. Little wool is sent down from Shiraz, and Bushire exports appear to be derived from the clip of the district. It is bought from the growers in bundles of 100 fleeces, and sorted for export. Price, March 1903, krs. 52 to krs. 53 per Hashem man (r83^. per lb.). The trade has probably suffered from the drought in recent years in Southern Persia.

All Persian wool (including Khorassan), produced in hot wind-swept regions, is naturally dirty and locks, dead, and tallen wool, are constantly passed in along with the fleeces in order to make weight This causes much trouble in sorting, lowers the c ass ot the wool, and gives rise to considerable complaint It must be remembered, however, that the wool is not grown by owners of big runs, who might be reasoned with, but is the joint produce of the numerous owners of the village or tribal flocks each of whom tries to secure an extra kran or two by adding weight to his few fleeces. The practice can, therefore, in existing circumstances^ only be remedied by pressure from the principal buymg market, and the most efficacious means of brinffincr such pressure to bear would be found in the exercise by buyers of a rigid discrimination between honest and false packed wool. This would compel the shippers to follow the same line and could not rail eventually to have its due effect upon the growers—to their own ultimate advantage. Azerbaijan wool is all consumed in home industries It is somewhat stiff and _ hard in quality for carpet-making. The best comes from the Khoi and Moghan districts; the largest supplies from the Soujbulak district. Khorassan, and even Kerman wools have been imported to Tabriz for carpet-making. Meshed is now the only large export market for wool in Persia. All Khorassan and Seistan wool exported goes through Trans- caspia, and is recorded in the Customs Statistics as an export to Russia; a large part, however, passes in transit to markets in Germany, Britain, and America. The price of raw wool in Meshed in 1902 was krans 450 per kharwar (2'gd. per lb.); in 1903, krans 750 per kharwar (4*8^. per lb.). Nishapur is reported to produce annually some 2,500 bales of 6J pouds each, price being quoted at krans 700 per kharwar (4vf/. per lb.), and Sabzwar some 5,000 bales, the price in August 1903 being quoted at krans 850 per Tab. kharwar (5^. per Tb.). One large buyer was reported to have run up prices. All the leading exporters of Khorassan wool make advances in cash some months before delivery. This system is described under another heading. There are two wool clips in Khorassan; the spring clip is longer and usually whiter and commands a better price than the autumn clip, which is, however, more free from dirt.

The bulk of the trade is in the hands of the Persian merchants, dealing through partners or agents in Constantinople, who come much more into contact with Continental manufacturers than traders by the Gulf routes. Broadcloth is a most important line, and comes chiefly from Austria, but also from Britain, Germany and France. The largest demand is for goods of medium and low quality, and shoddy. The trade in broadcloths is still a steady and perhaps increasing line of business, although fa5onne suitings and trouser ings have recently become popular. These fagonnd goods, all wool, or cotton and wool, are much appreciated by the middle and even lower classes as suitings and trouserings, and are taking the place of broadcloths, double twills, Thibets, &amp;c. British manufactures have taken a good place in this trade, for which German, Italian, French and Swiss goods all compete. Woollen Italians are being run out by cotton Italians, Bradford double twill by French all-wool goods, and Bradford serges and poplins by cheaper cotton fancies. Double twills, b^ack Italians, union-leather poplins, alpacas, &amp;c., are often of British manufacture. Merinos, cashmere, imprimes, woollen satins, &amp;c., are more generally of French or Continental origin. The sale of imitation Astrakhan is of some importance as it is largely used for the manufacture of Persian headgear (“ kolah ”). Cloth is made up in pieces of iS-inch fold, tilloted ; packed usually in cases. Bale goods are wrapped in a half piece of Mexican, which sells along with the bale at half value. The Tabriz market continues to supply a large part of Persia— Tehran, Hamadan, Ispahan, Yezd, and Khorassan. British imports through Ispahan, especially of suitings, wool or mixed, appear to be gaining ground in Yezd and Khorassan. Also the small trade by the Bunder Abbas and Nushki routes to Khcrassan shows signs of developing.

Tobacco. Tombac {Persian). j T hi r S P la . nt (^' cot | ana Persica Lindl) is quite a distinct species and the Persian name (“ tombac ”) is quite different from that used tor tobacco ( tetoon ). Shiraz tombac is considered in Persia to be the best, and the crop is largely disposed of inland. Ispahan tombac, again, is grown for export. The Socidte de Tombac has a monopoly of the trade with Turkish possessions subject to an export duty in Persia of 27 shahis per bag fsay 74^. per cwt.). They take about half the Persian production and have an agent stationed at Ispahan. Bushire merchants have exported to Egypt, and more largely to Aden, where it is resold for other markets, and a British firm has been receiving inquiries and orders from America and Brazil. Some difficulty has been occasioned in clearing tombac for Aden, even on a declaration of sale there, on the ground that it may be destined for Turkey.

Cheap Russian cigarettes, on which there is a drawback of the whole excise paid, are also imported. Watches. There is a small trade in cheap watches of Continental make. Wax, Raw. A small trade exists in bees-wax from Azerbaijan to Russia. Wood. There is a small trade in building timber from India and Zanzibar to the Gulf ports for local needs. The forests of Mazanderan are leased to a Russian firm. It is reported that all the valuable wood near the coast has been cut down, especially boxwood, of which only small wood now remains, and that the cost of transport to the coast makes this business less profitable than formerly. IV.—Trade Methods and Conditions in Persia. There seems to be a very general impression that business in Persia usually entails credit of 20, 30, or even 50 months. In reality the great majority of transactions are closed in from two to four months, or an average of three months' credit, and much business is done on shorter terms. Between the importer and the wholesale Persian dealer prices are quoted at long terms, piece-goods often at 18 to 22 months, woollen and silk goods at 4=5 to 50 months, but according to existing custom these terms are subject to discount at the recognised rate of 12 per cent, per annum.

In Tabriz only “ new” coin is used, in other parts of Northern Persia new coin is most commonly used, and in Southern Persia “ old ” coin forms the chief part of the currency. The coinage consists of- Nickel Silver -[ 1 shahi pieces, 2 shahi ,, (20 shahis=i kran.) f 5 shahi pieces. J ^ ” ” ... i 1 kran „ ] ^ &gt;&gt; ») l 55° REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. The nickel coin is struck for the Persian mint in Belgium, and the 5 kran pieces in Russia. Cnly a small quantity of the latter have been circulated. Imperial Bank of Persia notes are legal tender, and issued in denominations of 1 toman, 2 tomans, 3 tomans, 5 tomans, &amp;c. (10 krans = I toman). Gold coin is also struck at the Persian mint in pieces of 1 ashrafi, 2 ashrafies, &amp;c., and are often called gold tomans, but have no legal parity with the silver coinage, and are dealt in at fluctuating rates. Most of the Persian traders keep their business accounts with native bankers (sarofs) from whom they get advances in current account, and the importers also usually find it convenient to keep accounts with these sarofs. Teheran is now the central exchange and money market. The average rates of exchange there for 3 months date—Imperial Bank of Persia—drafts on London have been :— For 1S97 ... ... krans 5i’20 ... per £ ,, 1898 „ 5 o ' 8 5 • • • 5 j ,.

The rate of sterling exchange in Tabriz is generally J to 1 per cent, below Teheran {i.e., less krans per £); in Resht at par with Teheran to 1 per cent, below Teheran rates ; in Meshed | to per cent, below Teheran; in Ispahan and Yezd | to 1 per cent, above Teheran ; in Ramadan, Kermanshah, and Shiraz 1 to ij per cent, above Teheran ; and in Bushire ij to 2 per cent, above Teheran. The imports in Southern Persia always exceed the exports, whilst that position is frequently reversed in the northern provinces, especially in the autumn, when produce is moved. The constant stream of pilgrims to Bagdad, and Kerbela carries large quantities of krans to Bagdad, which are remitted again by bankers to Ker manshah and Bushire for purchase of drafts on London. Competition. The British importer finds his most formidable competitor in the Banque d’Escompte de Perse. During the last two years this bank, through its branches at Teheran, Tabriz, and Meshed, has made large imports of Russian merchandise, chiefly on indents from clients. They keep samples and price lists from which clients can fill their orders. The following transaction in prints, reported at Tabriz, appears to comprise most of the conditions usually arranged. The client lodged a margin (his own promissory note) with the indent. On arrival of the goods the bank debited him with invoice cost and charges in roubles, plus 2 per cent, commission, and interest ran at 8 per cent from date of arrival. The client paid 33 per cent, of the amount in krans* for which he was granted a rate of exchange 1 to percent, better than the ruling market rate of the day, and received delivery of the goods. The balance was payable within six months at client’s option. The client at the same time obtained a three months’ option at the same favourable rate of exchange for any payments to account of the balance due in roubles (bein&lt;T thus at liberty during these three months to pay at the current rate of exchange if rates turned in his favour). The option in exchano- e was pro bably an exceptional condition, but the bonus of 1 to i-J per cent, on the market rate of the day was for a time constantly granted to applicants for drafts able to prove that such remittances were in payment of merchandiseTRADE METHODS AND CONDITIONS. 5 1 purchased in Russia. The purchaser of a fair consignment (say, 100 bales) could leave the goods with the bank for any period up to six months, paying interest at 6 per cent. only. Latterly the bank is reported to be offering less favourable terms. Weights and Measures. Weights and Measures are different for every province, almost for every town. 3 The principal weights in use are— 16 miskals = i seer. 5 seers = i ker\ankeh or abbasi. 8 abbasis = i man Tabriz. Tabriz (or Sakat) = 640 miskals = 6*547 lbs. avoir. Shiraz (or 9 abbasi) = 720 )) = 7*366 n Bushire (or 9J abbasi) = 0 VO a = 7*775 n Kohneh = 1,000 &gt;&gt; = 10*229 »» Shah = 1,280 &gt;1 = 13*095 too mans Tabriz = i kharwar = 654766 lbs., or 5*846 cwts. (The above equivalents in lbs avoir, are calculated according to the ratio established by the Customs Convention of 1903.) Other local weights :— The Bunder-Abbas man, equal to about 9 lbs. (12 mans = 1 cwt.). The Meshed man, 665 miskals, or about 6 80 lbs. The Maragha man, of 1,380 miskals, (2^= 1 poud), or about 14*12 lbs. The Shuster man, reputed to be 1,536 miskals, or about 15*45 lbs. (7J mans = 1 cwt. The Hashem man, of 12,160 miskals or about 124 lbs., used in Bushire and Karun. The Ismailia man, of 120 okes, and for wheat in the Karun, 135 okes, or about 3J cwts. The Busreh man, for dates, about ij cwts. The Ram Hormuz man, of approximately 100 lbs. Russian weights :— • . 40 funt = 1 poud. 1 poud = 5*5 mans Tabriz = 36*1127 lbs. Persian measure of length :— The unit of measure is the zar, divided into x^ths anda^nds. In Teheran it is 40 inches in the bazaars, and is calculated in peace goods business at 41 to 41} inches. In Shiraz it is about 42 inches. In Tabriz it is used in piece goods business as equal to 113 centimetres or 44 J inches, or as 19 Tabriz zars equal to 30 Russian arshines’ from which 1 zar = 44-2 inches. In Meshed it is about 41 inches. The Russian arshine is 28 inches. Transport. There are only two routes in Persia over which merchandise is trans ported by wagon, the Resht-Teheran and Ashkabad-Meshed roads. The ordinary means of transport are camel, mule, and donkey caravans. H 252 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. The donkey is not much used for transport of foreign goods ; it carries too small a load, and is not big enough to keep valuable merchandise clear of water and mud. Iron bars, copper sheets, other metals, and merchandise which can be conveniently split up into small loads are, however, forwarded by donkey. On the Bunder Abbas route it is much used. The mule caravan is very largely employed, and is everywhere available, except on the great desert tracks from Bunder Abbas, Kerman, and Yezd, to Southern Khorassan and Seistan. The camel caravan is the best and cheapest form of transport, and competes successfully even against wagon traffic on the Rssht. Ashkabad, and Erivan roads. The abominably rough and stony surface of the Bushire- Shiraz route keeps the camel caravans off that track ; they have, however, negotiated the steep gradients of the Ahwaz route, where the surface is better. (See Annex C., p. 80, for note as to keep of mule« and camels.) The packing of merchandise destined for inland Persia must be such as will adequately protect the goods against weeks of exposure to burning sun in summer, or rain, snow, and sodden ground in winter. The packages forwarded by mule caravan will have to endure rough handling, through animals falling or colliding with others, or from tired or careless “ charvadars ” letting packages fall to the ground from the animal’s back when unloading nightly. Packages transported by camel caravan suffer less in this last respect, as the animal kneels to be unloaded. Packages forwarded by wagon get much chafed by the bolt heads and other protections on the rough boards, or by other packages. The wagons are expressly constructed to allow of much play amongst the different parts. It is asserted that packages suffer more from wagon than from pack transport. All pack animals carry their loads in two packages of approximately equal weight, slung by cords across the pack saddle. No package, therefore, must exceed half the total weight of the load. Bales are less fatiguing to the animal than cases, because they cling closer to the saddle and conse quently get less swing on during movement. They are also easier to handle, and are of convenient shape. The charvadar likes to have a small proportion of packages lighter and heavier than the average to suit the varting strength of his animals, but this is to be considered only in consignments of a large number of packages at one time. Bales for mule transport should weigh from 175 to 200 lbs., and the majority of them should be about 182 lbs., except on the Ahwaz-Ispahan route where the weight should not exceed 165 lbs. Bales for camel transport should jveigh from 250 to 300 lbs., and on the Trebizond-Tabriz route the majority of them should be about 287 lbs. On the Ahwaz-Ispahan route they should not exceed 275 lbs., and cases should average 220 lbs. Cases should weigh 10 to 15 per cent, less than bales, and an oblong form is preferable. The rate of transport for cases and sundries is always more than that for bales, usually 15 to 20 per cent. A statement of average rates of cost of transport is given in Annex B. (PP- 77 - 79 )- Very bulky or heavy goods pay exceptional rates, and within moderate limits can be transported by litter (“ takhterawan M ), slung on twm mules harnessed to shafts projecting fore and aft. A safe of modest capacity by a well-known British maker has lain for the last year or two in the middle of the third stage out from Bushire abandoned by a gang of porters who had rashly contracted to transport it to Shiraz. Wagoners on the Resht and Ashkabad roads charge special rates on heavy or bulky packages which cannot be handled by tw r o men. Packing. It does not appear probable that the British merchant has anything to learn from the Russian as regards packing of bales or cases. Consignees of Russian goods complain very bitterly of careless and inadequate packing.NOTES ON COMMERCIAL CENTRES, &amp;C. 5 A Russian bale of prints (20 pieces) will have a board at top and bottom, w iH corded at each end, and then wrapped in three plies of matting! Sometimes iron hoops are used instead of cords, and two plies of matting and an outer canvas instead of 3 plies of matting ; the difference in cost of this superior packing is usually charged to the customer. . The matting, boards, ropes, and canvas of a Moscow bale (of 250 lbs.) weigh to 35 lbs. The packing of bales made up in Erivan is much lighter, and weighs 16 to 18 lbs. An inner wrapper is not generally used in Russian bales. The Mexican wrap of the British bale is sold with it at about half value. V.—Notes on the Chief Commercial Centres—Local Trade Usages— Trade Routes, &amp;c. Bunder Abbas. Bunder Abbas is a port of some 6,000 inhabitants. The climate is intensely hot from mid-April to mid-October. There are, however, comparatively cool and pleasant summer resorts in the hills within one or two days’ march ^ The Customs Returns for 1901-02 and values of imports and exports 1902-03 give the following figures 1901-02. 1902-03. — £ £ Imports • 377.000 350,000 Exports . . . . . . 90,000 104,000 The British India Mail Steamers outward and inward call weekly and most of the steamers of other lines call to take or leave cargo. Landing) Warehousing) &amp;c. Steamers anchor quite two miles out and discharge to or load from native boats. There is a small pier opposite the Customs house which gives very insufficient shelter for landing cargo. y For freight engaged in Bombay, landing charges are added to freight in bill of lading, but on goods from elsewhere they are charged after arrival The landing agent’s tally clerk signs on board for cargo delivered, and the Customs Storekeeper (“ hamal bashi ”) signs to him on shore. Goods are afterwards cleared at the Customs on delivery order from the landing agent When claims for shortage or damage arise there is consequently great difficulty in fixing the fault. There is a tariff for landing, sorting, and warehousing at the Customs averaging about four annas (4^.) each on small bales or cases, and 8 annas (8d) on large. Robbery and pilfering of goods in the Customs godowns was formerly much complained of ; more recently, however, great improvement in this respect is admitted by traders, and the staff is reported to be much better disciplined under Belgian administration. The Customs godowns are commodious but other tenants have right of access to the enclosures, making it difficult to prevent pilfering. The Customs farm out the post of hamal bashi for (March 1903) krans 2,500 per mensem. The governor also is reported to have a voice in the nomination, and receives about krans 400 per mensem.54 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Insurance of goods from Europe is usually made to land, and often to destination inland. Insurance on exports by native merchants, as a rule, can be made only from the ship, but they seldom insure. &lt; Trade Usages, Credits, &amp;c. There is little local commerce ; the trade is all inland with Kerman, Yezd, Khorassan, Teheran and to a less extent with Lar. Details of imports and exports are given yearly in Bushire Consular Reports. There are no European firms established in Bunder Abbas, but the British India Steam Navigation Company and another British firm have agents. Much of the business is commission and forwarding agency, but there are several Persian and a few Indian merchants who trade on their own account, consigning to partners or agents up country and receiving produce or remit tances on India in payment. The bulk of the import trade is on indent, to agents in Bombay who purchase there for cash against the bill of lading. Goods often arrive in Bunder Atbas before the bill of lading has been taken up by the agent in Bombay. Very few orders are sent direct to Great Britain, although piece goods and even cotton twist are chiefly British. Bunder Abbas has no telegraphic communications—a want much felt by traders. The volume of merchandise (chiefly British) passing through this port entitles this matter to some consideration. Trade Routes. The principal trade routes inland are— 1, to Kerman by summer or winter route ; 2, to Yezd direct, the road passing well to the west of Kerman ; 3, to Seistan and Khorassan through Narmeshir, or through Kerman to Khorassan; 4, to Lar. The Yezd route is the most important, and freight from Bunder Abbas to Teheran by this route often compares favourably with the cost via Bushire; being camel transport, glass and fragile wares are reported to arrive in better condition. It is most desirable that attention should be paid to the policing of these routes. Merchants and charvadars state that open robbery, pilfering, and exactions are of common occurrence, and that the road gardians are perhaps the worst offenders. For cost of transport see Annex B. (pp. 77*79). Caravans avoid the Bunder Abbas region during the height of summer on account of the excessive heat. Lingah. A port with 10,000 to 15.000 inhabitants. The Customs Returns for 1901-02 and 1902-03 give the following figures as values of imports and exports 1901-02. 1902-03. £ £ Imports . . . . 128,000 74,000 Exports . . . 144,000 148,000 These totals differ very widely from those given in the Bushire Consular Returns. The latter include transit trade. The British India Steam Navigation Company call weekly outward and inward, and. other steamers call occasionally.55 NOTES ON COMMERCIAL CENTRES, &amp;C, Landing, Warehousing, &amp;c. The anchorage is quite a mile out, and cargo is landed and embarked as at Bunder Abbas. Cargo in transit can be landed and retained in Customs warehouse for a month or six weeks and re-exported without payment of duty. Trade Usages, Credits, &amp;c. There is very little inland business. Imports are chiefly cotton textiles, and grain, fruit, and other provisions for local consumption. There is a small trade with Lar, from which some consignments of tombac are exported to Aden and Turkey. The place is really important as an emporium for the coast towns and fishing fleets on both shores of the Gulf. Sailing craft from the Pirate Coast and the fishing ground of the lower part of the Gulf can usually make a fair course on the prevailing wind both to and from Lingah. They therefore run in there for stores of all sorts, for which they pay in pearls, shells, and rupees. The Persian Government did not appear to realise the peculiar position of Lingah in this respect, and the Customs for some time showed a disposition to bring merchandise landed in transit under the operation of its tariff, which would have driven trade elsewhere. Bahrein lies too far up the Gulf to gain much advantage, but there. is little doubt that if the British possession of Basidu (Bassidore) had possessed a water-supply and landing and warehousing facilities trade would have been rapidly transferred to it. The Persian Government has, however, apparently reconsidered the matter, and is now disposed to treat the transit trade of Lingah on former lines. The small business in mother-of-pearl, mussel and oyster shells might be considerably developed if arrangements could be made to carry supplies to the fishing fleets at their stations and receive the shells from the boats, which at present can carry to market only the take of the last few days before running to port. Pearls all go to India, generally by British India mail steamers. The Customs formerly charged a J per cent, ad valorem duty on pearls exported from Lingah, and it now appears likely that they will continue to adhere to this scale. No telegraphic comrfiunication with Lingah exists. Trade routes. To Lar, but of little importance. Bushire. Population 20,000 to 25,000.

Steamers anchor some three miles out, and discharge to or load from open boats. These boats are often overloaded ; and the merchandise, insufficiently protected by tarpaulins from spray in rough weather, is frequently damaged. The Customs (March 1903) signs for cargo to the ship, lands, sorts for examination, and, after clearing, delivers merchandise at the Merchants’ go- downs according to a tariff scale (Annex D. pp. 80-81) equal to about kran 1 (4^.) each on medium bales (180 lbs.). Double rates are charged on goods transhipped. The Customs wharf appears to be too cramped to alfow of prompt manipulation of cargo. There is another wharf, but not used apparently for Customs work. The Customs warehouse accommodation was inadequate in March 1903 but an extension was being made. Some improvement was to be desired in efficiency of the native staff, and in office equipment, such as weighing machines, &amp;c., to expedite sorting, clearing, and delivery of merchandise. The pilfering from goods opened in the Customs House, which used to be so much complained of, has been much reduced under the Belgian administration. Cases of jettison of outward cargo between shore and steamer have occurred so frequently that the merchandise of Persian subjects can be insured as a rule only from ship. Trade Usages, Credits, &amp;c. The local trade of Bushire is not very important. It supplies the Persian littoral south towards Lingah, and north towards Bunder Rig and Behbahan. The bulk of business done is for markets in Shiraz and Ispahan. The trade with Great Britain is for the most part done through the British firms established in Bushire. Three-quarters of their sales to local customers are in sterling, the purchaser taking risk of exchange, and handing approved sterling bills to the seller at due date, difference of interest for days to run being calculated at 6 per cent. The greater part of the sterling bills is bank paper received from correspondents inland, or bought|locally. A part of these transactions arises from indent business for account of Persian customers, and the bill is accompanied by documents sometimes against payment only, more frequently against acceptance, and interest is charged at 6 per cent, from date of payment for the goods in Europe to due date of return remittance. Sales made in local currency (krans) are usually on credit running from one to three months, tea, sugar, matches, metals, &amp;c., which are quickly realised, being dealt in on shorter terms than cloths, &amp;c., of slow overturn. The Persian traders in Bushire consign their goods to principals or partners in Shiraz and to correspondents or agents in Ispahan. Details of imports and exports are given annually in Bushire Consular Returns. Trade Routes. The only important route is vid Borasjun and Kazeroon to Shiraz. The land route by Ahmadi to Borasjun is little used, as it is considered unsafe on account of raiders from Tangistan. The charvadar contracts for conveyance of merchandise between Bushire and Shiraz, but takes up or delivers his loads at Shief, and pays boatmen to effect the transport between Bushire and Shief by sea. The want of regulation and control over the boatmen, remarked on in regard to cargo to and from steamers, is equally apparent here, and goods are even more frequently damaged through overloading and inadequate covering. There is no drinking water at Shief, and charvadars have to work from Khoshab, some 16 miles distant, coming down to Shief to deposit or pick up loads and returning at once. There are no godowns at Shief, and merchandise is deposited on the open beach to await charvadars or boatmen, often for days, or even weeks.V&gt; 5 ^ I S) notes on commercial CENTRES, &amp;c. -7 Bushire he and n Shi^7 nth V! 1 |! re ' S g0 ° d g u raZ ' ng for trans P ort animals between animals time to 41 ’ CaraVal ' S m ° Ve ty Sh ° rt Stag6S t0 allow the The road is so rough and steep that camel caravans do not frequent it. c.-T h f e ^ StanCe b ';‘ tween Bushire and Shiraz by road is not over 170 miles • Shief 0 Sh,ra Z may be ,50 or .55 miles or , 3 stages for merchandise’ but the normal term for transport is 25 to 30 days, and in the grazing season 40 to 50 The charvadars endeavour to shut out competition by contracting to carrv goods by relays (“do kesh”) at minimum rates. That is, they carry a part 0^ the goods a stage or two inland, leave them there, usually on the road-side w.th or without a guardian, and return for more. When the lot has been collected it is gradually moved up to Shiraz in the same way. Quicker transport can usually be obtained at higher rates. c f The / j CUri Tu ° f f tr ? vellers a ” d merchandise by this route is not properly safeguarded. The foreign trave ler is comparatively safe, but the native travellers are blackmailed by the road guards, and robberies are often com mitted. There is an easier but longer route to Shiraz through Firuzabad but it is not frequented on account of the disturbed state of Tangistan. The Governor of Bushire proposed (March 1903) to* form a company to construct a road from Shief to Dalaki (40 miles) for the conveyance of passengers and goods by wagon to the foot of the kotals, and to establish a regular service of transport animals from that point to Khan-i-Zinian from whence the road and wagon service would be resumed to Shiraz. A former director of customs in Bushire had made some progress with a scheme for a landing and lighterage company to undertake the carwo service between shore and steamer, and between Bushire and Shief. A pa'rt of the capital needed was subscribed, but the scheme fell through on the death of the promoter. A Russian official is reported to have been studying recently the question of organising a more efficient transport service for Russian goods from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan. Freight to Gulf ports from Great Britain, after a period of low rates caused by the appearance of a new line of British steamers, has resumed the former average of about 355. per ton weight or measurement, equivalent to about 4=^ per ton weight on piece goods. , R uss i an Steam Navigation and Shipping Company, with a subsidy of about 21,000/. per annum for 12 years from 1903 and reimbursement of Suez Canal dues, has effected five trips this year. Freight is now quoted at 20 copecks per poud (or 26s. person weight). The Ispahan agent of a Russian firm has stated that Russian piece goods by this route arrive in Ispahan at about the same cost as vt'd Enzeli. Up to the present time this service does not appear to have secured full cargoes in either direction. Further information as to this steamer line will be found in Annex E. pp. 82-83, in the form, of a memorandum by the Vice-Consul at Bushire on Russian steamers to Persian Gulf ports. Muhammerah.

The import business is in the hands of native traders, and has decreased since Koweit became a regular calling place for the Br.tish India steamers. Careo for or from Karun ports is transhipped here, and development of trade must be looked for in Ahwaz and Shuster rather than Muhammerah. Karun ports—Ahwaz and Shuster. The following are Messrs. Lynch Bros’, statistics, per Consular Reports ;— ’ r 1901. 1902. £ £ Imports . • • 68 »929 8 5&gt;903 Exports • • - 59,193 96,4,67 Average for three years 1895-97* P er Consular Reports: £ Imports . • • • 4 2 &gt; 4 00 Exports . • • • 3 °, 100 Three-fourths of the merchandise is carried by Messrs.

The trader does not need to have an agent at Muhammerah, as Customs examination is made in Ahwaz or Shuster, where an agent is needed in any case to take charge of goods forwarded to or received from the interior. The regions of Dizful, Shuster, Bakhtiariland, and the lower plains of the Karun, in which trade should naturally converge on the Karun, may have a population of over 300,000. Chief products, grain and wool. At Bunder Nasri, goods not taken delivery of at the steamer side are landed at a small charge and warehoused free for one month by Messrs. Lynch. Cargo for Shuster is transferred from Bunder Nasri by a short tram line to a smaller steamer plying between Ahwaz and Shuster. The tramway concession was granted to a Persian subject by the Persian Government to facilitate trade, and has served to obstruct and monopolise traffic. The charge is krans 3 per ton (is. 1^.) either way, the distance being a mile and a quarter, and the working plant can carry 50 to 60 tons a day. The Ahwaz-Shuster steamer, worked by Messrs. Lynch under arrange ment with the Persian Government, runs in connection with the Muhammerah- Ahwaz steamer. At Shuster no convenience appears to exist for landing or warehousing. The Shuster trade is worked by Persians in Bombay. These forward goods to correspondents who return produce. The Shuster merchants have the reputation of cautious traders, working well within their means. Dizful, Shuster, and Ahwaz are connected by telegraph (Persian only) with Bushire through Behbahan. Trade Routes. The excellent trade route from Shuster and Dizful to Khoremabad, Burujird, and Sultanabad is absolutely closed on account of the lawless state of the country it traverses. The postal service has been abandoned. The Bakhtiari route from Ahwaz and Shuster to Ispahan has received some attention this year, and several traders have stated that consignments by it have arrived in Ispahan at less cost and quicker than by the Bushire- Shwaz route It traverses a very mountainous country, and packages orwarded should not exceed 165 lbs ,n weight for mule transport, or 375 lbs for came transport.

Cotton, barley, linseed, millet, sesame, have all been grown on it, and in average years there is a sufficient rainfall to produce an abundant spring crop of wheat, obtained with a minimum expenditure of labour and without manure. There is an important water-supply, at present running to waste, to be obtained from the Karun river, which is heavily charged in spring with fertile mud. The remains of former barrages and canals exist; presumably, therefore, the engineering difficulties are not formidable. Greater difficulty mi §^» perhaps, be anticipated in securing remunerative employment for the water made available. The region is inhabited by lawless Arab tribes, who claim, and to some extent use, the land, and they are neither accustomed to labour nor ambitious of change in their condition. The winter in Ahwaz is cool and pleasant, but the summer, from May to September, is very hot, with a temperature of ioi° to 104° in the shade, dry heat. Kermanshah. The Customs Returns for 1901-02 and 1902-03 give the following figures as values of imports and exports :— Imports Exports 1901-02. 1902-03. T T - 865,724 885,100 - 182,546 ' 5 S,'S 5 All imports and exports (except Turkish) pass through Busreh and Bagdad. All Gulf steamers touch at Busreh, and cargo for Persia is transhipped there to Bagdad without Customs examination, the bulk of it being on through bills of lading, which include transhipment. The rates charged' from Busreh to Bagdad by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company on through cargo are— 35s. per 1,000 kilos for loaf sugar. 37^. per ton for all other cargo. Bombay cargo is ton weight; other cargo according to tonnage scale. Local cargo, when space is available, is taken by weight. fhe Turkish steamers handle goods less carefully, and there is some doubt as to speedy settlement of claims for damage, shortage, dec. They usually take freight at 4s. to 6s. less than the Euphrates and Tigris Company. At times, sailing boats ( serafina ) are employed, freight by these averaging 15s. to 20s per ton, but it is difficult to insure by them, and valuable merchandise is seldom sent. Freight from Bagdad to Busreh varies from 7s. 6d. to 22s. per ton weight. December to April is the slack season, when rates are low. There is universal complaint of insufficient steamer transport from Busreh to Bagdad. Goods are often blocked for four or five months. The Euphrates and Tigris Company is allowed to have only two steamers running (they keep a third in reserve), and the Turkish service has been very slow, and seldom has more than two out of four steamers at work. They are, however, preparing (March 1903) to increase their fleet. Wharfage at Bagdad is very cramped. Goods have to pass the Customs here. Merchandise declared in transit for Persia pays the full import duty of 8 per cent, ad valorem, and is entitled to refund of 7 per cent, on production of the transit pass countersigned at station of exit within six months. Instead of the Turkish duty of 8 per cent, in cash, a payment of 1 per cent., accompanied by a guarantee to pay the other 7 per cent., or to produce the countersigned transit pass in order, is accepted by the Customs from parties who have lodged security. This is a regular business, and guarantees are furnished on reasonable terms, say 10 paras per package.6o REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Goods declared for transit are warehoused at Bagdad free for 3 0 days in the Customs, after which dues are— Per day up to 7 days, 1 raij piastre per day } p er package not exceeding From 7th to 14th day, 2 „ „ £ 112 kilos. „ 14th to 21st „ 3 , f „ J Per package not exceeding 224 kilos, double the above rates. „ exceeding 224 kilos, treble the above rates. Traders can hire godowns from the Customs at a monthly rent on more moderate terms. The importers sell to the native merchants trading with Persia, but many native merchants, particularly Jews, deal direct with Manchester. There are two caravan routes to Kermanshah— vtd Khanikin and vid Mendeli. The latter is not used, being considered unsafe. On the Khanikin route there is a wagon service for passengers as far as Shahraban (58 miles), and a good wagon road could be made to the frontier at moderate expense Transport of merchandise is by mule caravan in winter. Rates are usually lower in summer, when camels compete for freight. On the Persian side, the charvadar’s way-bill is checked at a Customs post on the frontier, and the merchandise passes the Customs at Kermanshah. Previous to the Belgian administration, Customs duty at Kermanshah was nominally 2 per cent., but really 1 to i-J per cent, ad valorem. The Customs at Sinna are under the Kermanshah administration. The greater part of the goods cleared at Kermanshah are destined for Hamadan, and transport is usually engaged from Bagdad to Hamadan. The Kermanshah region grows splendid wheat crops at so low a price as to endure the costly transport to the sea-board at Busreh. It is most regret- able that agricultural progress in this region has been hindered by excessive taxation and vexatious regulations. Tabriz. The Customs- Returns for of imports and exports :— 1902-03 give the following figures as values 1902-03. Imports Exports £ 1,238,331 724,584 Trade through Astara pays Customs duty there, but merchandise through Julfa and Khoi can be examined at Tabriz. A charge of 6 shahis per package is made on exports from Tabriz for “plombage ,, to the frontier. Exports through Russia must be accompanied by a declaration of origin, and the Customs charge krs. 9 for attesting each declaration. The ad valorem charge of'one per cent, on goods in transit through I urkey has been abolished on the Trebizond route since 1873. It is levied however, at Constantinople on merchandise from Persia landed there for re-expo, tation. (See Annex F, p. 83, extract from letter from Mr Lon^- worth, Trebizond.) s Jracie usages, Lredits, &amp;c. The Tabriz traders, through their representatives in Constantinople are much more in contact with Continental manufacturers than traders in other parts of Persia. British cotton goods have not met with much competition from the Continent, but in silks and woollens the large croDorf-inn nf Continental goods.,s marked. The Persian trader gets long Sof from four to eight months m Constantinople from Continental manufacturers. Ihese bills are drawn and made payable in Constantinople. Former!v thev were drawn on the Icbriz merchant and sent to Tabriz for collection. J 162 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Freight by this route is generally lower in winter, as camel caravans avoid it in the heat of the summer. The route from Batoum via Tiflis, Erivan, and Julfa is available only for Russian imports. From Batoum there is now communication by rail through Tiflis to Erivan. The general railway system of Russia is also connected with Tiflis and Erivan by the Bakou*Petrovsk line. From Erivan the railway will be carried within two years to Nakhichevan. At present merchandise for Persia is carried by wagon or camel transport to Nakhichevan over a good macadam road, and thence to Julfa by partially metalled road. From Julfa to Tabriz transport is by camel or mule caravan. The route from Astara vid Ardebil is also employed for Russian imports to Tabriz and other parts of Azerbaijan. Goods are shipped from Baku or the Volga and Astrakhan to Astara. The caravan track from Astara to Ardebil is said to be the worst in Persia, and only trained horses are used for transport on it. A Persian company has obtained a concession for a road, and is reported to have completed five farsakhs, or one-half of the distance. The Russians are also building a road inland from Astara on their side of the frontier, but it has been carried only two or three miles to Nemin on the frontier. From Ardebil to Tabriz there is a good caravan track, and transport is by camels and mules. The route from Tabriz to Teheran is of minor importance to Russian trade, as Kazvin, Zanjan, and Teheran can be reached more readily from Resht. All British and continental goods from Trebizond for the Teheran and other Persian markets pass over this road by camel or mule caravan, Russia has obtained a concession for a road from the Russian frontier through Tabriz to Kazvin, and engineers have been surveying for some time past. It was reported that the engineers recommend that the road should touch the Aras (Araxes) some miles above Julfa, in order to avoid the difficult defile of the Darreh-Diz. Freight from Moscow' vid Poti to Tabriz comes to about Rbls. 1*70 per poud, and vid Astara to about Rbls. 1-50 per poud. As the cost from Erivan to Tabriz is at present, say, 50 copecks per poud, improved rail and road trans port to Tabriz cannot greatly improve the Russian position in that market. Any economy or quickening of transport between Tabriz and Teheran will benefit the British and Continental imports vid Tabriz for other Persian markets. Caspian Ports (Enzeli, Lengerood, Meshedi-sar, and Bunder Gez). The Customs Returns for 1902-03 give the value of imports as and of exports as ^1,156,730. The Caucas and Mercury Steam Navigation Company run a passenger service and carry the mails from Baku to Astara and Enzeli, bi-weekly in summer and weekly in winter. . Numerous cargo boats from Baku and Astrakhan also touch at Astara and Enzeli. One steamer is run by Persian owners, and this boat crosses the bar at Enzeli and * discharges and takes in cargo at the Customs wharf. The other steamers all anchor outside the bar and discharge to and load from boats. Cargo by the Caucas and Mercury line is landed at their own wharf and warehouses where the merchadise is inspected by the Customs officers some time after landing. From Enzeli to Pir-i-Bazaar merchandise is conveyed by boats and is there transferred to two-wheeled carts for transport to Resht. The Caucas and Mercury Company also run a weekly service from Baku vid Krasnavodsk to Bunder Gez and Meshedi-sar. Trade Usages, Credits, &amp;c. The pro\inces of Mazanderan and Ghilan are prospering great increase in rice and silk production. on account of theNOTES ON COMMERCIAL CENTRES, &amp;C. 6 3 entered into this business, making advances to proprietors against con signments to be sold on commission. A number of European firms are interested in the silk business, chiefly French, Italian, and Greek traders. The conditions on which business has been run hitherto appear to have been very lax and indefinite. Advances are made to the cultivators four or six months (and recently, in some cases, more than a year) before date of delivery of cocoons, and often to nearly the full value of the quantities contracted for. No condition is imposed as to the quality of the cocoons to be delivered and the price is not fixed till late in the season when a great part of the quantities delivered have already reached Marseilles. The Banque d’Escompte de Perse is reported to be offering to make advances to cultivators against consignments of cocoons to be sold on commis- sion. The cultivators are becoming better informed as to prices abroad, and several Persian firms are exporting on their own account. The exporters have in consequence had some difficulty in fixing a price this year, and have now formed a syndicate with a view to establishing more satisfactory conditions of business. Trade Routes. The Resht-Kazvin road is noticed under Teheran. The route from Meshedi-sar to Teheran is for caravan traffic only, but merchandise is conveyed more quickly and at less cost than by the Resht route. Teheran and Demavend produce is usually exported via Meshedi-sar. The Bunder Gez route carries Russian commerce with Astrabad. Shahrud and Yezd. Khorassan. The Customs Returns for 1901 *02 and 1902-03 give the following figures as values of imports and exports :— 1901-02. 1902-03. £ £ 408,216 416,706 Imports Exports . 439. iq 8 . 329,864 Customs examiation of merchandise via Ashkabad, Dushak, and Kariz may be made at Meshed ; goods not passing through Meshed are examined at Kuchan or frontier Customs stations. Merchandise by the Seistan route is examined at Nasratabad. Trade Usages, Credits, &amp;c. Meshed is the central market for wool and cotton, but agents are frequently employed to buy cotton in Kuchan, Sabzwar, and Nishapur, and wool in Turbat. In the wool trade the big buyers all make advances at 12 per cent, interest to the wholesale Persian sellers some two or three months before the clip is ready. These advances secure a sort of option over a given quantity of wool (proportionate to the advance) at the ruling price to be fixed by arbitration when the clip is ready for delivery, the advance to be refunded, plus interest at 12 per cent., if either party declines to accept that price. The price is discussed between buyers and sellers at informal meetings of the trade till arbiters see their way to propose a price acceptable to a sufficient majority. This somewhat loose form of contract, which depends greatly upon trade usage for its efficacy, appears to work fairly well in practice. The middleman probably buys his wool by the fleece from peasant owners to whom he has in turn made advances, and delivers it to the exporter who sorts and pays for it according to recognised proportions of each grade.6 4 REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIA. Cotton is exported as received from the growers, imperfectly ginned and dirty, and has to be cleaned in Russia. Hand-worked machines were tried in Sabzwar, but were found to break the fibre. A Russian firm is setting up a ginning mill near Sabzwar. The plants are grown from local seed ; it is alleged that the dry climate requires acclimatised seed. The buyers make advances to the growers, as in the wool trade ; sometimes five or six months before delivery. The crop is gathered in by September, but is not delivered, ginned and packed till the end of the year. Trade Routes. The route from Ashkabad vid Bajgir and Kuchan to Meshed is now a carriage road, easily traversed by carriages in summer, but very difficult in winter on account of snow on the Ashkabad-Kuchan section. The Kuchan- Meshed section is not metalled, and must be deep in mud in wet weather. Transport of merchandise is by fourgon and camel caravan. The Post Office mails are carried by a contractor, who also runs a passenger service between Ashkabad and Meshed (two days). The shorter but much more difficult caravan track between Meshed and Dushak on the Transcaspian Railway is also used for merchandise, but to a less extent. Direct trade with Seistan and Bunder Abbas usually follows the Kaf Valley route, Herat and Afghan trade branching off at Kariz. The Seistan route does not offer any advantage to trade between Great Britain and Khorassan, direct freight to Persian Gulf enabling our mer chandise to arrive in Meshed more quickly and at less cost via Bunder Abbas. A great part of the trade with the south passes through Yezd. Ispahan. Chief products for export Opium, cotton, tombac, dried fruits and nuts, gums, skins, madder root, manufactures of copper and brass, procelain,* carpets, cotton tissues, block prints. Trade Usages, Credits, &amp;c. In the piece goods trade it is a common condition of purchase that a half or two-thirds of the value is payable at option of the purchaser in approved bills on Teheran 49 days’ date at par ; on such bills a grace of 15 days is accorded in Teheran. The larger part of the piece goods trade is done by British firms. Usance is the usual 21 or 22 months. Contracts are not expected to be discounted before two months, and are usually paid under discount within three months. Of the wholesale dealers’ purchases one-fourth may go to the retail trade in the town, on credit running, on an average, to four months ; the remaining three-fourths, sent out into the surrounding districts, may run for six or eight months. 1 A good deal of business is done by Persian traders in Ispahan on commission for Persian traders in Shiraz or Bushire who have bought from import houses in Bushire, and who draw from Shiraz on the Ispahan consignee at 25 to 35 days’ sight, or get return of funds in produce or sterling drafts. Little business is done by Persians direct with Great Britain. In mer chandise from British India, however, the business is larger, and is done on indent to Persian agents in Bombay. Trade Routes. The caravan route from Bushire and Shiraz is most used, but is not safe trom highway robbery.NOTES ON COMMERCIAL CENTRES, &amp;c. 65 Pilfering from bales or cases is frequently complained of, and the charradar disowns liability on the ground that the theft may have been committed between Bush.re and Shiraz, before he took over the goods in The Post Office mails and passengers are now carried as far as Maksudbeg by wagon or carriage The service is in the hands of the contractor for th? leheran-Ispahan mails, a Persian subject. Much of the trade with Kazvin and Resht goes through Naizar and Saveh. Dried fruits and cotton are often sent direct to Kazvin and disposed of there to exporters to Russia. F There is some trade with Yezd through Kuhpa, but foreign trade in \ezd generally follows the Bunder Abbas and Shiraz routes. Shiraz. Chief products for export-Opium, tombac, gum, skins and pelts dried fruits and nuts, cotton, carpets. r ' Bombay^ ^ ^ us ' ness * n Shiraz is done by Persian merchants dealing with In the piece-goods trade a large amount of business is reported to have been done of late in Bushire directly with the smaller traders, who consign to Shiraz and compete closely there. 5 Trade Routes. To Bushire •via Kazeroon. Through freight is sometimes engaged from Shiraz to Teheran in which case caravans diverge to the right from the trunk route at Surmeh and following nearly parallel tracks, pass to the east of Ispahan near Segzi and strike the Natanz-Kashan road. It is stated by charvadars that this is an easy route for caravan animals, and that, being off the main road, fodder and provisions are cheaper. Trade with Yezd follows the Ispahan road and strikes off to the rinht near Dehbid. s Hamadan. Population estimated locally at 50,000. Chief products for export—Leather, opium, skins and pelts, carpets. The Hamadan tanneries are the best in Persia, and its leather, chiefly goat and sheep skins, is sent all over the country, and exported through Tabriz to Russia. Gallnuts are obtained from Kurdistan, and a small quantity, but cr 0 od —1 from Luristan. Alum is obtained from Zanjan. Trade Usages, Credits, &amp;c. . Hamadan, however, is more important as a distributing market in the piece-goods trade, and does as large a business in certain goods as Ispahan Whites, greys, light prints, and red twills are the chief kinds sold. A few traders work by indent on Manchester through Bagdad shippers with whom they lodge a 10 per cent, margin. The shipper claims amount of manufacturer’s invoice and charges to Bagdad on arrival of the goods there and usually has right of sale if the goods are not taken up within ak davs after arrival. - . ■ • . . . r **0 I 9 Interest on advances, or commission, is not usually charged on piece-goods so presumably the shipper’s profit ts made in Manchester.

The differences tor the year 1902*03 are trivial ; for the year 1901-02 the following differences may be noted : — In my Table I., Im ports—Clothing should be increased by Krs. 62,000 ; machines, &amp;’c.,by Krs. 257,000 ; dyes should be decreased by Krs. 90,000.

Bullion in the form of bar silver is known to be imported in large quantities to be coined at the Persian mint; imports for other purposes are very small «- I have also excluded exports of fish from my tables.

These exports are almost entirely from the Caspian, as the value of fish exported from the South of Persia does not exceed Krs. 100,000 annually. Persian fishing rights on the whole Caspian littoral are leased to a Russian subject for a long period of years at an annual rental of, at present, about 18,000/, which seems a very small royalty on such an export as that stated for 1003-03 1 believe the value of fish and fish products exported by this concessionaire has not been controlled hitherto by the Persian Customs Administration; moreover, in the Russian Customs Statistics for 1898 the value of fish (fresh, dried, salted, smoked, &amp;c., and roe of fish) imported from Persia in that year is given at Rbls. 960,000 only, and 1 have'not obtained information of a phenomenal growth in this trade in recent years. The totals of imports and exports in my Tables I and II, after taking into account the differences above noted, will be found to agree with the totals of the sums of all the articles enumerated in the Official Commercial Statistics, but not with the figures given in the Abstract of Imports and Exports prefixed to them.

So the exact- meaning of regular service appears to have been left for deiermination by the Company according to the amount of cargo they might be able to secure to feed their steamers running to the Gulf. To judge from the arrivals*at Bushire since January last it seems that the number of sailingslrom Odessa will not be more than four or five annually, for the present. I have not been able to find out what the rate of freight from Odessa to Gulf ports was at the start.f But the rate at present quoted is 20 copecks per poud, or, roughly speaking, 26*. per ton of ao cwts. It appears that at the beginning freight used to be charged according to the measurement, that is, per ton of 40 cubic feet, which, in the case of piece goods, used to be somewhat more than the freight by weight. So it can be safely said that in the case of piece goods the rate of freight has been reduced to some extent. Whether this reduction has increased Russian imports into the Gulf is.a question which cannot be answered in the affirmative. But, certainly, the reduction in the rate of freight will tend to encourage Russian imports in course of time if a market can be found forlhem. Hitherto, only one Russian (Moscow) firm has sent out piece goods to any appreciable extent, this firm has its own agents in Shiraz and Ispahan. The consignments hitherto brought out from Odessa, excepting piece goods, have been very insignificant, consisting of-loaf-sugar, glass and earthenware, lace, &amp;c. In 1901, the Russian steamers brought out about 20,000 cases of kerosine sent by a Batoum firm, which had opened an agency here. This agency has since been closed, the venture having proved a failure owing to competition.! The “ Trouver ' in her last voyage^ to.the Gulf brought 20^000 qases of kerosine for this firm. As regards the rate of freight from Bushire to Odessa, it used to be 40J. minimum and 48*. maximum per ton of 40 cubic feet, but this has now been reduced to 32 copecks per poud, or about 4Is. per ton’of 20 cwts. This reduction in the case of country packed cotton bales becomes very considerable. Sixteen of these bales go to a ton of 2o cwts., whereas by measurement they give about 5 tons of 40 cubic feet. So the freight on the country packed cotton bales may be said to have been reduced from 200^. to4i-r. It is this article which has specially supplied some little return freight to the Russian steamers. In all about r,ooo bales of cotton have been shipped to Odessa for the Moscow firm alluded to above by their Ispahan and Shiraz agencies. Another article whfch has contributed towards the return freight is tobacco shipped-for-Port said for the Societe des Tombac, and it is reported that some negotiations are going on for the carriage of all the tobacco for the Societe by the Russian steamers, but that no definite arrangement has yet been come to, as the Society is wanting to have monthly shipments, which the Russian Steamship Company is not in a position to arrage for at the preseat. From further inquiry I find that the Societe proposes to issue-tenders in Bushire when ever they have tobacco for shipment. It is also reported that the Russian Company is trying to compete with the existing British lines for the carriage of shells, but as the bulk of the Gulf shells are exported to Hamburg and the Russian line has no direct steamers running to that port, the shippers are not likely to avail themselves of the Russian line, which can only undertake the carriage by means of transhipment at Port Said, and it is said that shells suffer much by transhipment. As regards the so-called museums, none have as- yet been- opened at Bushire, but samples are shown when wanted. I-hear-that the samples will be shortly displayed. * “ Trouver, ” 24th January; “ Trouver,” 23rd May; “ Korniloff,” 13th July; “ Trouver, ” 29th August.

In 1898, say 44^000/.• In 1901-02, 679,000/., and in 1902-03, 492,000/. Average 585,000/. The year 1901 was marked by a considerable increase in trade generally, and in the piece goods trade in particular. Trade with British Empire. With regard to British and British Indian trade.it is more difficult to get satisfactory records. Our trade enters Persia by many routes, and it is almost hopeless to search for simultaneous returns from all of them. British and British Indian statistics are far from complete, as much of our trade is carried on through intermediate markets in Bagdad and Constantinople. The Annual Reports of the Consulate at Bushire, carefully complied from reliable sources, such as ship manifests, &amp;c., maybe accepted as fairly accurate for quantities. The values given are optimistic. These reports show imports of cotton textiles at the ports of Bushire and Bunder Abbas for the last eight years as follows:— 1895. 1896. 1897. 1998. 1899. 1900. 1901^ 1902- £ ^ ^ ^ £ 594,400 622,600 970,400 616,100 £ 848,600 521,300 £ 870,300 £ 597 , 3 °o Average 685,000 733 &gt; 8o ° 608,500 V 793,000 „ ‘ 709,400 7 00 &gt; 75 ° The average for three years 1895-97 ^ 746,700/., and for three years 1900-02, 736,400/. The imports by these two important routes thus show a slight decrease. Lingah is a place of great importance as an emporium for the smaller Gulf ports and fishing fleets, but is not a trade route to the interior of Persia. The total value of cotton textiles passed through the Custom House at Lingah into Persia for the two years iqoo-oi to 1902-03 was only 67,560/. The Bushire Consular Reports, which include transit trade, show for the two years, 1901-02, an excess of imports over exports of cottons of 62,700/. The imports at Lingah for Persia are, therefore, only some 30,000/. to 35,000/. per annum. The foregoing Consular Statistics are for imports of all cotton textiles, but the pro portion of other than British and British Indian manufactures is very small (in 1901, 5 per cent.). The Consular Statistics for Mahammerah give the following as the value of the imports of cotton textiles :— 1805. 1896. 1897- i8 98- £ £ ^ rf 70,300 78,200 57) 000 106,200 135,200 of which the following went on to Karun river ports 18,500 46,900 15,000 29,800 29,800 But a great part of the Muhammerah imports were for account of Koweit markets, as evidenced by the fall in imports since the summer of 1901, when the British India steamers commenced to call regularly at the latter port. As regards Kermanshah there are no reliable statistics available prior to 1901.

Inquiries in Bagdad, Kermanshah, and Hamadan have a tended to show that this route into Persia has long carried an important trade, which has steadily, but not phenomenally, improved during the last 10 years.*1 Heeved on the 14th March 1905, under cover of a letter from His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, No. 9, dated the 4th February 1905. Tehran, 31st January 1905. No. 18. My Lord, I have the honour to transmit herewith the annual report which has been prepared by Mr. Grant Duff on events in Persia during the past year. This period, during which it has been possible to form a fair estimate of the Ain-ed-Dowleh’s system of Government, has been characterised by a reaction against the laisser aller and extravagance in domestic, and the deference to Russia in foreign, politics, which marked the last Ministry of the Atabeg-i-Azam, and more especially the years 1900, 1901, and 1902. The Ain-ed-Dowleh has not completely succeeded in extinguishing the deficit left by his predecessor, for the cholera and the effects of the war on Persian trade have been against, him,, but he has sought from us rather than from Russia such foreign financial assistance as was indispensable to him in order to effect his purpose. His relations with us have never been as cordial or intimate as those maintained by the Amin-ed-Dowleh or by the Atabeg-i-Azara during the period from Sir Henry Wolff’s arrival to the regie disaster with my predecessors and his slowness, his suspiciousness, and his intense orientalism have often made him most difficult to deal with. His great object seems to have been to eliminate all foreign interference in the internal concerns of the Monarchy, especially in such matters as the appointment of Persian Governors and officials, and to resist demands in whatever quarter made, for commercial concessions, roads, telegraphs, etc. His ideal Government would probably be one like that of the Amir of Afghanistan and his policy may be summed up as the exclusion of European influence in any form, as far as possible, with a certain preference for English over Russian, but only as the lesser of two evils. He has thus justified the forecast which, when he first took office, I ventured to submit to Your Lordship in my despatch No. 150 of September 25th, 1903. The anti-foreign tendencies of the Grand Vizier have not sensibly weakened, as was at one time anticipated, the power of the Belgian element in the Persian Administration. On the contrary it has somewhat gained in strength owing to the necessities of the Ain-ed-Dowleh’s economic policy. He has recognised that without European officials the restoration of Persia’s solvency, which is the first condition of her continued independence, is impossible, and whilst not perhaps trusting Monsieur Naus as fully as did the Atabeg he has given him a very free hand. The relations between the Belgians and His Majesty’s representatives in Persia have, I think, improved during the past year, and there has been owing to the action taken by the Government of India on one side and by Monsieur Naus on the other, a cessation of the constant friction which gave so much trouble in Seistan. The renewed efforts of the Persian and Belgian authorities to undermine the privileged position enjoyed by us in quarantine and postal matters in the Gulf Ports have in fact constituted the only serious matter of contention between His Majesty’s Legation and the Departments controlled by Monsieur Naus. Minor disputes, arising chiefly out of the attempts of those departments to introduce European regulations, and restrictions in a primitive Eastern Country without providing the corresponding advantages and facilities afforded by the Governments o'f civilized Europe, have usually been fairly, quickly and satisfactorily adjusted. The incidents of the war in the Ear-East have undoubtedly weakened Russian prestige, but have increased the suspicions of the Persian Government that we may. be tempted to take advantage to its detriment of Russian embarrassments, and these fears, which the Russians have done their utmost 6235to encourage, have to a slight extent qualified the satisfaction of the Court and governing circles, though not, I think, of the Clergy and people, at the reverses sustained by the Russian arms. As a whole the year under review has been uneventful and our own relations with the Persian Government throughout it, though by no means all that could be wished may be regarded, when allowance is made for its unpro gressive character, as fairly satisfactory or at any rate as perceptibly improved. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., Mr Lord, &amp;c. Ac. &amp;c. Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servant, A. H. HARDINGE. NARRATIVE OF EVENTS IN PERSIA IN THE YEAR 1904 . At the beginning of 1904 the principal departments of the Persian Gov ernment were under the control of the following Ministers :— President of the Council of Ministers (His Highness was raised to the rank of Vezir-Azam, on January 24 tb, 1904 , and was made Sadr Azam on August 25 th of the same year. Both tliese titles may be translated Grand Vizier, but that of Sadr Azam is the higher of the two.)

During the last few weeks of 1903 and the first quarter of 1904 relations between His Majesty s Government and the Government of the Shah were somewhat strained m consequence of a difference of opinion which had arisen as the responsibility for the failure of the Viceroy of India to land at Bushire during His Excellency s visit to the Persian Gulf in Becember 1903. The correspondence on the subject continued both in London and at Tehran for some months after the incident occurred. In a memorandum addr Jed bv the Marquess of Lansdowne to the Persian Minister on January 25th His Lordship nn^ose wnn/i l 068 “i’T'' HlS . Ma j c9t y’ 8 Government that any useful W b .t Se / Te, &gt; b y discussing the details of this very unfortunate incident.. ..without wishing to impute blame to any particular individual n a T P d f I 1 n 3 d 0 T e ,T n0t but fee i that the main responsibility for the nnfortu- nate failure which has occurred rests with the Persian Authorities” In a iurther memorandum, dated March 16th, Lord Lansdowne informed theAla-es-Sultaneli that flis Majesty the King considered that in view of the friend ship existing between Great Britain and Persia it would be a mistake to make the incident the subject of prolonged discussion. Further attempts were made by the Persian Government to continue the controversy, but they finally allowed the matter to drop. On January 27th His Majesty’s Minister returned to Tehran from his tour in the Persian Gulf whither he had proceeded at the end of October 1903 to meet the Viceroy of India. Sir A. Hardinge had on his return journey from the south visited Mohamerah, Ahwaz, Bagdad, Nejef, the oil-wells near Kasr Shereen, and Kermanshah. Shortly after his arrival at the capital His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to ascertain whether the Persian Government would permit the construction of a telegraph line between ftasretabad (Seistan) and Kul Malek Siah. On March 16th the Ain-ed-Dowleh informed Sir A* Hardinge that the Shah objected to the line in question on the ground that it would create difficulties between Persia and Bussia. What these difficulties would be did not at first appear, To Foroigo oooft n„. 4 9 . 2 3 rd M.rch ‘I} 6 a 9™ d T'™.* subsequently in- formed Sir A. Hardinge that when the Kussian Government objected to the Central Persian Telegraph Convention of 1901 His Majesty the Shah has verbally assured the Russian Minister that no northerly extension of the land line, created by that arrangement, in the direction of Siestan, would be allowed. On Sir A. Hardinge’s recommendation the matter was temporarily dropped. On February 17th Lord Lansdowne informed Sir A. Hardinge that his „ . , xt I* u * v Majesty’s Government were being urged Foreign Office telegram No. 14, 17th February 1904. . v . . . . by the India Office to insist that the phrase “ Fars and the Persian Gulf ” used in the Russian loan contracts of 1900 and 1902 should be interpreted in accordance with the engagement given by the Persian Government in 1897 that under no circumstances would the Customs of Southern Persia be mortgaged to a foreign Power. The India Office pointed out that the discussion of the “ R&amp;glement Douanier ” offered an opportunity to raise the point. His Lordship asked for Sir A. Hardinge’s views. He replied that he considered the discussion of the “ Rkglement ” afforded the desired opportunity for settling the question at issue, but suggested that the British case would be strengthened if he could state on the authority of a geographical expert that Mohammerah was a port on the Persian Gulf. Lord Lansdowne, after making enquiry, telegraphed that the Admiralty Hydro- grapher considered that Mohammerah was, like Bussorah, a Persian Gulf Port, it being situated on the tidal water and being reached by sea-going vessels. In „ . ™ , a memorandum addressed to the Ain-ed- Dowleh on March 8, Sir A. Hardinge pointed out that when the Russian Loan Agreement of 1900 was published, it appeared that the customs excluded from the guarantee were those of “Fars and the Persian Gulf.” Unless, therefore, the words “ Customs of Fars, etc.,” were to be understood as an equivalent of the words “ Customs of Southern Persia ” the Persian Government had broken the written pledge given to His Majesty’s Government in 1897. In his memorandum Sir A. Hardinge reviewed the various attempts which had been made since 1900 to obtain from the Persian Government a definite interpretation of the phrase in question. He then stated that “ before authorizing me to accept the customs regulation in the manner provided by the Convention of 1903, His Majesty’s Government desire me to come to some clear understanding with the Persian Government as to the exclusion of all the three districts (Arabistan, the South, and Baluchistan) which whether covered or not at the time by the term * Fars and the Gulf of Fars * are undoubtedly covered by the term ‘ Southern Persia * used in the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s note of 1897, from the actual or potential operation of the Russian Loan Agreements.” After further correspondence in which the Persian Government attempted to avoid a definite settlement of the question, a note was addressed to Sir A. Hardinge stating that in using the words “ Fars and the Persian Gulf ” the intention of the Persian Government was to exclude from the Loan contracts4 all the ports of the south, and that they had thought this intention adequately expressed, in view of the fact that Sir. Afl. Durand, then His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in his last note on the subject had used the term “ Dorts of Ears.” The note added that the Persian Government could not now alter any expres sions in the loan contracts and interpret them without the participation of the Russian Bank, and if, contrary to all expectation, discussions were to arise iu connection with this question, they would have to be referred to arbitration. To this communication Sir A. flardinge was instructed to reply that His Majesty’s Government took note of the formal admission made by the Persian Government that it was their original Foreign Office No. 121,8th August. intention, in using the term “ Customs of Pars, etc., ” to include in that expression all the ports of the south, but that His Majesty's Government could not otherwise accept the note as satisfactory. Sir A. Hardinge was to make it clear to the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government held them to their engagement of 1897. He was to add that as it was admittedly intended by both His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government that the term “ Customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf ” should include all the Customs of Southern Persia referred to in the engagement of 1897. His Majesty’s Government could not admit a solitary exception in the case of Mohammerah and its dependencies, or of any of the ports of Arabistan, and that they would take steps to insure respect for their rights in the event of any attempt on the part of the Persian Government to ignore them. Subsequently the Mushir-ed-Dowleh requested Mr. Grant Duff, who was v oo ^charge of His Majestv’s Legation during the absence of Sir A. Hardinge at Tabriz, to suggest to Lord Lansdowne the omission of the last phrase in Sir A. Hardinge’s note, the Shah objecting to its minatory tone. Mr. Grant Duff was instructed that there appeared no reason for omitting the phrase referred to. The telegram conveying this instruction miscarried and as the Persian Govern ment have not since reverted to the matter, no reply has, up to the present (January 1905), been made to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s suggestion. At an interview between His Majesty’s Minister and the Bakhtiari Khans on February 3rd, Haji Ali Kuli Khan enquired what support they might expect from His Majesty's Government in the event of an attempted Russian conquest of the country, and should the Persian Government adopt a hostile attitude towards them in consequence of their friendly relations with His Majesty’s Legation. Sir A. Hardinge replied that he thought it unlikely that the Persian Government would resent the friendship between the Bakhtiari Khans and the British Legation so long as the present good relations between Persia and Great Britain continued, and he could see no reason why these good relations should be injuriously affected, since the maintenance of the integrity and independence of Persia was one of the main principles of British policv in the east. The precise nature and extent of our support would be determined by the circumstances which called it forth and could not be defined before hand. Sir A. Hardinge’s language to the Bakhtiari Chiefs received the approval of His Majesty’s Government. On March 2nd, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz reported that the Valiahd had contracted a loan amounting to £80,000, with the Russian Banque d’Escompte in order to pay off his existing liabilities including a debt of £44,000 due to the Imperial Bank of Persia. As His Imperial Highness appa rently gave no reliable security, it may be taken for granted that the transac tion was a purely political one. In March cholera broke out at Kermanshah having been introduced from Kerbela. Owing chiefly to the action of Agha Pazel Mamakani, a Mujtehed of Nejef who broke through the cholera cordon between Khanekin and Kasr Shereen with a large number of followers, the disease rapidly spread through- out the whole of Persia, The epidemic raged in Tehran and its neighbourhood during the summer months and is said to have destroyed there about 13,000 • Estimated by American Missionaries. persons. Towards the end of August the epidemic abated, hut in January 19055 was still existing in Azerbaijan and Ardelan. There is, therefore, every pros pect of a farther visitation during the summer of 1905. It is interesting to note that the number of deaths in the British village of Gulhek was under a dozen in spite of the fact that the population during the epidemic amounted to over a thousand people. Some of the neighbouring villages in which sanitary precautions were not enforced suffered severely. At the end of March His Majesty’s Minister reported that all the provin- To Foreign office, No. se,2sth M^h. cial Go ™ r nors had arrived in the Capital where they had been summoned by the Shah to a conference on financial reform. An examination of the proposed reforms as reported in Sir A. Hardinge’s despatch No. 69 of April 22nd, 1904, shows that three principal innovations were contemplated :— 1. The collection of the revenue to be left in the hands of the local autho rities, but the taxes so collected to be paid into a provincial treasury, which after paying fixed salaries to the Governors and local officials would remit the surplus to the central treasury at Tehran. 2. The appointment of a “ Minister of the Grand Vizier’s Cabinet ” who would practically become Under Secretary for the interior. Moayyed-es- Sultaneh, who was long Persian Minister at Berlin, was appointed to this office. He resigned in the summer of 1904 and the Grand Vizier’s Cabinet was never really formed. 3. The appointment in each province of a “ Muffetish ” as a check on the local Governor. Later in the year the Ain-ed-Dowleh introduced a tax on salaries of 10 To Foreign Office, No. 87 , 19 th May. P** Cent in 8 ° me CaSeS &gt; ia ° therS ° f 20 per cent, to 30 per cent. After the Persian new year (M;irch 21) the following changes were made in the Governors of Provinces :— Fars . . . Ala-ed-Dowleh was replaced by Shoa-es-Sultaneh. Zafar-es-Sultaneh „ Rukn-ed-Dowleh. Jellal-ed-Dowleh „ Moayed-ed-Dowleh. Salar-ed-Dowleh „ Muzsiffer-ul-Mulk in Luristan, and Azana-es- Sultaneh in Arabistan. (Muzaffer-ul-Mulk was dismissed towa'ds the end of the year and Luristan was given to the Ferman Ferma, Governor of Kermanshah). Khorassan . . The Rukn-ed-Dowleh was transferred to Kerman and his place taken by Assef-ed-Dowleh. Kerman Tezd . . Arabistan and Luristan On April 19 th Sir A. Hardinge informed the Grand Vizier that the Amir of Afghanistan had accepted Colonel MacMahon’s Seistan Boundary Award. In April the Persian Government suddenly erected their flag and placed guards on the islands of Tomb and Abu Musa belonging to the Sheikh of Shargah. On representations being made by His Majesty’s Minister the To Foreign Office, telegram No. 61, 24 th May. Persian Government agreed to remove their flags and guards but reserved the right to discuss with His Majesty’s Government their claim to these islands. Early in April owing to the increase of cholera at Karmanshah the Russian Legation demanded that the quarantine arrangements in that town should be placed under the control of the doctor of the Russian Consulate foreseeing that a compliance with this demand might lead to the establishment on the Baghdad frontier of a Russian cordon similar to that existing in Kho rassan, Sir A. Hardinge despatched Dr. Scott of the Indo-European Telegraph Department to Kermanshah. Dr. Scott was instructed to insist that the local authorities should pay the same attention to his views on sanitary questions as to those of the Russian Doctor. The Persian Government recognised the justice of this demand, but appointed a physician of its own in the person of Dr. Vaume Bey. 62356 On April 15th Sir A. Hardinge addressed a despatch to Lord Lansdowne regarding the alleged partiality of the Belgian Customs officials throughout Persia and notably in Seistan, towards Russian as opposed to British interests. Accompanying this despatch were reports from His Majesty’s Consular Offi cers tending to show that the charge of partiality was unfounded. Early in March Lord Lansdowne informed His Majesty’s Minister that the Government of India were anxious to take advantage of the cool season to establish a telegraph station at Henjam. Henjam was originally authorized as a telegraph station by the Persian Government under the convention of 1868 but was relinquished after twelve years. The Persian Government were informed of the intention of the Government of India to re-erect the station at Henjam and were at the same time requested to give permission for the con struction of a line connecting Henjam with Bunder Abbas. The need for this connection had been brought to the notice of Lord Curzon by the British community at the latter port during His Excellency’s visit to the Persian Gulf m 1903. Communication between Henjam and fndia was re-established on To Foreign Office, telegram No. 62 , 26 th May Apiil 19th, but in answer to Sir A. ~ f ^ j . . Hardiri ge , s note a reply was sent to the eltect that the 8hah bad signified his intention to construct the line himself shortly. In the mean time a postal service was to be organized between the ?o!u e V n -3 UeStl ? D * I)urill S Sir A - Hardinge’s absence from Tehran (September 12th to December 15th), Mr. Grant-Duff continued to press the Persian Government to allow the Bunder Abbas-Henjam connection to be constructed. To Foreign Office, telegram No. 138 . Towards the end of November the t\ rv . . , Mushir-ed-Dowleh informed Mr. Grant- Duff that he thought the Shah might consent to the line being built by the British Government if it were handed over on completion to the Persian Government^ on payment of the cost of construction. To this arrangement His Majesty s Government stat6 d they were disposed to agree provided that *! , “ w f s “ i,d , e by means of a land line across Kishm Island and hat British officials should work the telegraph office at Bunder Abbas unless Foreign office, telegram No. 76 , and un til the Persian Government took i , — . _ ovei the line. The Persian Governmpnt were also to bind themselves to work the line when it came into their possession with Persian subjects only. The matter is still under discussion. P0SSeSSI0n On May 13th Sir A. Ilardinga reported that the extension of the Central Persia telegraph line from Bam to the frontier near Kuh Malek Siah was completed, thus establishing for the first time in history direct overland communication between Europe and India.

Sir A. Hardinge suggested that the Ports should be alkedto abstain from any over acts until the question of the rights of the case had been considered in conjunction with the British and Bussian Representatives. Instructions were sent to His Majestey’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg to inquire whether the Russian Government would join His Majesty’s Govern ment in a representation to the Porte on the lines suggested by Sir A. Hardinge. The Russian Government replied that orders had already been given to support the representations of the Persian Ambassador at the Porte. Similar instruc tions were sent to Sir N. O’Conor. On May 12 th Amin-ed-Dowleh, who was Grand Vizier in 1897 , died. He was sincerely Anglophile and was an enlightened man with liberal and progressive sympathies. A certain lack of vigour in giving practical effect to his theories appears to have been one of the causes of his fall. About the middle of May the Grand Vizier sounded His Majesty’s Minister on the subject of financial Telegram No. ,4. . assistance. On July 4 th Sir A. Hardiuge reported that M. Naus wished to complete the British Loan of April 1903 , as he was anxious about the effect on his receipts of the Russo-.Japanese war and the cholera. The sum required was £ 100 , 000 . On July 13 th Lord Lansdowne instructed Sir A. Hardinge that as regards the question of security the condition of the advance was (1) that it should be secured solely on the Southern Customs, and (2) that the Persian Government should give a clear statement that the customs of all southern ports from Mohammerah to Gwetter inclusive are hypothecated for the service of the entire loan of £ 300 , 000 . Sir A. Hardinge pointed out that (2) was an entirely new condition, and although it might be attached to a new advance, it seemed scarcely just to attach it for the first time to the completion of an earlier one in connection with which it had never before been mentioned. After some further correspondence His Majesty’s Government decided to complete the advance on the same security as in the case of the preliminary advance of 1903 on the understanding that a note embodying their views as to the expression “ Pars and the Persian Gulf” was previously sent to the Persian Government. His Majesty’s Minister reported the completion of the loan agreement v- n- o ^* v 0X1 September 2 nd. The “ R&amp;glement To Foreign Office, telegram Ao. 9 o, 2 nd Septemeber. . r ,, • , * . orri.1 Douamer was signed on August 29 th. Two formalities preceded signature, viz., (1) Sir A. Hardinge put in a declara tion stating that he signed the &lt;f Resrlement ” with the reservation that the assurance respecting the pledging of the southern customs given by the Persian Government in 1897 , was in no way weakened or limited by the distinction made on the annexed table for administrative reasons between the Customs division of “ Arabistan” and that of the “ South,” which latter were not to be regarded as the only ones covered by the said assurance. M. Naus took formal act of this declaration. ( 2 ) M. Naus signed a supplementary declaration embodying the amendments of the “ Rbglement ” desired by the Government of India. Foreign Office telegram No 51, 11th August. On December 9 th, 1903 , His Majesty’s Consul-General at Tabriz had reported to Mr. Grant Duff, then in charge of His Majesty’s Legation, that a naturalized Canadian subject named Musni Daniel had been murdered by Seyed Ghaffar near Urmia. Mr. Grant-Duff thereupon addressed a note to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh demanding the punishment of the Seyed and com pensation for the family of the murdered man. In March 1904 the same Seyed and a number of Kurds murdered the Reverend Benjamin Labarree, of the American Presbyterian Mission, under circumstances of great brutality. Early in May Sir A. Hardinge and the United States Minister at the Court of Persia in a joint note to the Shah’s Government called attention to the condition of affairs in the Urmia district, and strongly ur&lt;&gt;ed that steps should be taken ( 1 ) to send an armed force to overawe the Kurds : ( 2 ) to supply the Governor of Urm : a with the requisite funds, and to inform him that the successful arrest of the murderers would be a condition of his maintenance in office ; ( 3 ) that the Mujtehed, Mirza Hussein Agha, of Urmia, who had extended his protection to the Seyed, should be removed from Urmia ; (1) to offer a pecuniary reward lor the arrest of the8 murderers. As a result of this note, Seyed GhafTar, the principal murderer, was arrested and sent to Tabriz, but the accomplices, who were Dasht Kurds, remained unpunished. Daring the summer and early autumn of 1904 repeat ed representations were made both by His Majesty’s Minister and by the United States Minister with a view to obtain satisfaction for tlie murder at Urmia. In spite of the fact that His Majesty’s Consul General at Tabriz, and subsequently Captain Gough, were sent to Urmia in order to force the local authorities to take action, nothing was accomplished. In September Sir A. Hardinge proceeded to Tabriz and personally used his influence with the Valiahd to obtain a settlement of the case. The Persian Government, how ever, still continued to delay and to make excuses. In October Sir A. Hardinge proceeded on leave to England, leaving Mr. Grant-Duff in charge of His Majesty’s Legation. Towards the end of November Captain Gough n was attacked by Kurds near Urmia and this circumstance enabled Mr. Grant-Duff to obtain the dismissal of the Nizam-ed-Dowleh, Governor of Urmia, and the promise of the removal of the Mollah, Mirza Hussein Agha. At the close of the same month the United States MinLter, finding all representations un availing, was instructed by his Government to inform the Persian Government that if they did not agree by December 5th to the demands made {viz., 50,000 dollars (in gold) compensation, the imprisonment for life of the Seyed and the execution of the guilty persons], steps would be taken to enforce compliance. The Persian Government, after a few days’ delay, unconditionally accepted the American terms and paid £6,000, the balance to be paid if the guilty persons were not brought to justice by March 1906, or if the principal murderer, Seyed Ghaffar escaped from imprisonment. Several of the Dasht Kurds, im plicated in the murder, were arrested in January 1905 and sent to Tabriz. Shortly after the departure of Sir A. Hardinge for Tabriz the Hashmet-ul- Telegram t „ Foreign CMce, No. 102. ^'Ik informed Mr. Grant-Duffi COD- fidentially that the Shah intended to keep him indefinitely at Tehran, although without depriving him of the here ditary Governorship of Seistan. Mr. Grant-Duff was instructed to warn the Persain Government that such a disturbance of the political status quo on the frontier, as would be involved by the removal of the Hashmet from his post, and the transfer of the Acting Governorship now vested in his son, to another official, would not facilitate the realization of the desire expressed by the Shaik for the early withdrawal of Colonel MacMahon and his force from Seistan. The Persian Government in answer to Lord Lansdowne’s message, replied through their Minister in London that they deprecated interference by His Majesty’s Government with the internal affairs of Persia, but gave no satis factory assurances as regards the Heshmet. Lord Lansdcwne informed the Ala-es-Sultaneh that the Heshmet’s dismissal would certainly be attributed to his good will to England, would produce a most unfortunate impression, and might induce His Majesty’s Government to alter fundamentally their policy as regards Seistan and the adjoining regions. The Heshmet-ul-Mulk was still detained in Tehran at the end of January 1905. Towards the end of October His Majesty’s Consul General at Meshed reported that five new Russian telegraph clerks had arrived at that town and that there were strong rumours that the Meshed-Seistan line was to he taken over by the Russian Government. Telegram to Foreign Office, No. 116 , 27 th October, The Mushir-ed-Dow I eh in reply to inquiries made by Mr. Grant-Duff admitted the arrival of the clerks but denied both verbally and in writing that there was any question of handing over the Seistan line to the Russian Government. It would appear that these telegraph emplovds were introduced into Persia without the knowledge or sanction of the Persian Gov ernment. They, and others who previously or subsequently arrived, are posted at various points on the line but up to the present have not been permitted to work in the Persian Offices. The Persian Government are trying to obtain their removal, and negotiations with the Russian Government were still proceed ing in December both at Tehran and at St. Petersburg. Early in November news reached His Majesty’s Legation that Colonel Tekgrum to Foreign Office, No. 121 , 2 nd Novem- Douglas, Military Attachd at Tehran, and btr ’ Mr. Lorimer, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul9 at Ahwaz, had been attacked and wounded between Khorremabad and Dizful- Mr. Grant-Duff at once demanded (1) that effective steps should be taken by the Persian Government to protect the officers concerned, (2) the punishment of the guilty tribe, and (3) eventual compensation for loss incurred. It sub sequently transpired that Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer were attacked by their own escort of Derekvend Lurs. Mr. Grant-Duff was instructed to inform Foreign Office telegram No. 66,4th November, the Persian Government that His Majesty s Government had heard of the occurrence with indignation, that they held them responsible, and expected them to put an end to the state of things prevailing in south-west Persia. The Governor of Kermanshah, accompanied by His Majesty’s Acting Consul at that place, has now proceeded to Luristan for the purpose of punishing the Derekvends (January 1905). During the autumn of 1904 the Persian Customs Department complained on several occasions that the British Post Office at Bushire received and distributed parcels without the legal duty being paid on such parcels. Early in December the Belgian Director of Posts seized the British mail. Mr. Grant- Duff made immediate representations to the Grand Vizier, at the same time sending orders to His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General at Bushire to resist by force any further attempt on the part of the Persian Customs autho rities to tamper with the British mails. The Grand Vizier caused orders to be sent to Bushire to restore the mail bags which had been seized, to the British Post Office. A temporary arrangement was come to whereby a Custom House Officer is present at the opening of the British mails and levies duty on parcels addressed to persons not exempted under the “ ft&amp;glement Douanier. ” The question of the British Post Offices in Persia is receiving the attention of His Majesty’s Government. During the spring of 1904 His Majesty the Shah’s health became very uncertain and at one time it was thought that he might not survive the summer. Towards the autumn there was a considerable improvement in His Majesty's condition and his medical attendants are now of opinion that unless an acute illness supervenes His Majesty may continue to live for some time longer. In the course of the year 1904, Colonel MacMahon has demarcated the frontier between Persia and Afghanistan according to his arbitral award given in 1903. / In 1904 three circulars were addressed to the Foreign Bepresentatives in Tehran, the provisions of which, if enforced by the Persian Government, are likely to affect foreign enterprize in Persia in the future. These circulars gave notice that:— (1) No Persian subject holding a concession in Persia may enter into any transaction for the sale, transfer, or grant of that concession to a foreign subject. Any infraction of this decree will lead to the concession being annulled. (2) No Mussalman woman may in future work in silk (cocoon) factories belonging to non-moslem persons. (3) No foreign subject may in future open a factory in Persia without obtaining permission from the Persian Government. In taking note of these circulars His Majesty’s Minister pointed out to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh that as regards No. 1 he hoped to hear that the transaction by which the Moayyer-el-Mamalek had sold half of his telephone concession to the Russian Bank had been annulled by the Persian Government. The issue of circular No. 2 was brought about by an incident at Bar- froush. Mr. Charles Stevens, a British subject, has a cocoon drying establish ment at that town. In July the local authorities at the instigation of the Mollahs interposed to prevent women sorting cocoons in Mr. Stevens' factory and also beat and insulted some of the workmen. Sir A. Hardinge demanded, and subsequently obtained, the punishment of the aggressors and also informed the Persian Government that as regards the employment of women in factories belonging to foreign subjects, he claimed most-lavoured-nation treatment. V 5 ?10 As regards circular No. 3 His Majesty’s Minister informed the Mushir-ed- Dowleh that the requirement of previous permission to open a factory implied the right of refusal which might be so exercised as to nullify the commercial privileges enjoyed by British merchants not merely by the treaties but by long usage. Sir A. Hardinge stated that he had referred the matter to His Majesty’s Government, and in the meantime had instructed His Majesty’s Consuls in the sense of the circular from the Persian Government.

The Bakhtiari Road .—This road was travelled over by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan during the autumn of 1904 He reports that after careful examination he could see nothing to justify the complaints made by Mr Parry, Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ Agent, the Bakhtiari Khans having made good the road as far as Godar-i*Balutak. Mr. Preece on the whole length of the load saw only one dangerous spot. This was on the winter divergence on the top of the Darkish Warkish Pass. There were other places on the road which needed repair, such as the pass near Dopulum coming from Ardab, each side of the caravanserai at Shalil, some of the approaches to the Godar-i-Balutak Bridge on each side, the Malnmir end of the Rah-i-Sultaneh. From Jaru to Alwani some of the pass also requires repairs. Mr. Preece during his visit to the Bakhtiari Chiefs proposed that instead of giving a yearly sum for repairs amounting to 5 00 U krans and a corvee of 1,000 labourers, they should hand Messrs. Lynch 10,000 krans a year for the repairs. The Chiefs accepted this proposal and alsoagreed to give for the annual repair of the road a sum of 30,000 krans to be paid two months after March 22nd next. The payment of the yearly sum of 10,000 krans by the Chiefs will come into force after the road repairs have been effected. The Khans ask that this expenditure of this sum should be supervised by a representative of His Majesty's Government, or that they should be given the right of withholding the 1,000 tomans in the event of their being of opinion that the money had not been properly expended, and they wish to be informed which of these alternatives will be accepted by Messrs. Lvnch. * His Majesty’s Minister, in his despatch No. 17 of 1905 , has suggested that His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz should be instructed to include among his regular duties a supervision of the annual expenditure on the upkeep of the road. The above arrangement with the Khans is under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. In his despatch No. 73 of April 25 th, 1904 , Sir A. Hardinge remitted on behalf of the Khans a draft in favour of Messrs. Lynch for £ 742 . On September 13 th, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan reported that he had received a further sum of 30,300 krans from the Chiefs which he had paid to the credit of Messrs. Lynch at the Imperial Bank of Persia. A balance of 4 , 704 | krans (about £ 85 ) was still due by the Bakhtiari Chiefs to Messrs. Lynch. On December 31 st, Mr. Preece reported that the Bakhtiari Khans had paid the sums due to Messrs. Lynch up to March 4 th, 1904 . The Arahistan Road .—This road was transferred by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Transport Company in consideration of the payment by the latter company of £ 15,000 and the allotment of 10,000 fully paid up shares of £1 each. The deed of transfer which was signed on April 6th last may be briefly summarised as follows. [C66FD] 12 In consideration of the above payment the Bank transfers to the Transport Company :— 1. 1 he concession for the construction and working of— (а) the road from Tehran to Kum and Ispahan ; (б) the road from Kum to Ahwaz via Sultanabad, Dizful and Shuster; (c) extension of latter from Ahwaz to Mohammerah; (c?) branch road from Burujird to Ispahan and for the establishment of a transport service for the same. 2. The road itself with all property, rights, buildings, etc., acquired or held by the Bank under the concession. lurthcrmore the Bank agreed in a separate document bearing the same date as the deed of transfer : (1) to indemnify the Company from («) all claims in connection with the working of the concession up to the date of transfer; (b) all claims of the Amin es Sultan or any other parties (with the exception of any claim of the representatives of the late Yahya Khan under the agreement between him and the Bank, dated January 6th, 1890) to any interest in the concession. (2) to pay over to the Company any sum paid in to refund the loan of £13,000 at 8 per cent, interest made by the Bank to the late concessionnaire. To use its influence with the Persian Government to obtain from the Company the right to levy tolls on any part of the road where the right does not at present exist and generally support the Company in obtaining and main taining the rights bestowed by the Concession. ftrssiAN Boad Concessions. Kazian-Resht-Tehran Road.—m$ Majesty’s Acting Consul at Resht reported on November 3rd, 1904, that slow progress is being made with the Resht-Kazian Road which was unlikely to be ready for traffic in the near future although M. loltananoff, the Russian Director of the Road Companv, gave him to understand, in August 1904, that the Kazian Section would shortly be opened The Russian Company have not strictly followed the old road to Kazian which ■ was 24 miles in length, but have taken in private land wherever a deviation was considered necessary. It is stated that the land so appropriated will be paid for in due course. The Russian Consul at Resht has informed Mr. Consul Churchill that the iinzeli Harbour Works have been begun. 1 on, Th m, r0a o- Ee i' t , to Te,lran ha sbeen in fairly good state durin- 1904. The 1m Bazar-Kesht and the Resht-Sefid Ketele sections arc still liable to be very bad after heavy rain or snow, but the sections from the bco-in- nmg of the mountain road to Kazvin is in a satisfactory state. The walls’ at various dangerous points have been repaired during the year. Kazvin to Julfa via Tabriz.—m s Majesty’s Minister reported in his des- patch J.o. 1&lt;6 ot September 30th, 1901, that M. Bodiloviteh, the Manager of the Russian Banque d’Escompte at Tabriz, informed him that when the railwav from Envan to Julia was completed in June 1905, a service of motor cars would be established on the Russian Road from Julfa to Tabriz. The distance which is about 75 miles, will be covered in four hours. Sir A Hardin'o gathered that the motor service would be continued from Tabriz to Tehran but that work on that section of the road had been postponed owino* to the Russo- Japanese war, and that for the present the eitorts of the Russian Finance Ministry were being concentrated on the completion of communication between3 Russia and Tabriz. M. Bodilovitoh appeared to be unaware of the Sani ed See report on Concessions.

Quarantine in Persia in 1904. A serious epidemic of cholera visited Persia during the summer of 1904 . Quarantine stations were established on the Turkish frontier at Kermanshah, on the Azarbaijan frontier at Julfa, and at Enzeli, where the sanitary measures were enforced by a Russian doctor. As usual iu Persia, the arrangements made were of the most ineffectual description, and early in the epidemic one of the principal Mujteheds of Nejef broke through the cordon at Khanikin with a mob of beggars and undesirable attendants, thus spreading the disease in every direction. At Enzeli the arrangements were more satisfactory, but even there the precautions taken were by no means sufficient. It is not too much to say that land quarantine in Persia is an absurdity, and is looked upon by the European doctors in Tehran as not only useless but dangerous. In connection with the posting of a Russian quarantine doctor at Enzeli during the cholera epidemic, it may be mentioned that Sir A. Hardinge called M. Naus’ attention to the matter. M. N T aus pointed out that he had no option but to permit the presence of a Russian doctor. The Caspian, His Excellency said, was Russian territory, and thus Enzeli was practically situated on the land frontier between Russia and Persia. On August 1 st, a Sanitary Council was instituted at Tehran by order of the Shah. This body is under the Presidency of Dr. Schneider, the Erench doctor in the service of the Shah, and consists of most of the European doctors resident in the capital, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs (Mohta- shem es Saltaneh), the Minister of Police, and delegates from the Alinis- try of Customs, etc. The Council is supposed to meet once a month, and has for object the putting into force of the decisions of the Paris Sanitary Conference. Up to the present the Council has done nothing whatever toimprove sanitation in Persia, and the general opinion is that the Council is unlikely in any way to ameliorate the deplorable condition of things at present existing. During the summer of 1904 there was renewed friction between the British quarantine doctors in the Persian Gulf and the Belgian customs officials. The complaints on the part of the Persian Government was that the British Consul-General at Bushire claimed as coming within the scope of the British doctors the quarantine on the land side of Bushire between that port and the road leading to Pars. At a meeting on August 21st the Persian Government also claimed that the existing understanding with His Majesty’s Government was a purely provisional one which they were free to terminate at their con venience. At a meeting on August 21 st between Sir A. Hardinge, the Grand Vizier, the Mushir ed-Dowleh, and M. Naus, His Majesty’s Minister asked for the issue of immediate orders to the customs authorities at Bushire and elsewhere in the Gulf to abstain from interference in the administration of the quarantine by the British doctors. Sir A. Hardinere added that if the Persian Gov ernment w r ere dissatisfied with the working of existing arrangements, if they thought, for example, that the expenditure was unequally divided between themselves and the Government of India, let them make representations to that effect. But pending a settlement between the two Governments, he insisted that the existing arrangements should be allowed to continue without interference on the part of the officials of the Persian Government. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh and the Grand Vizier suggested that Sir A. Hardinge should produce documentary evidence that the existing system had been formally accepted by the Persian Government. In his despatch No. 170 of September 9 th, 1904 , Sir A. Hardinge pointed out that such documentary evidence was not forthcoming. The papers in the possession of His Majesty’s Legation are very meagre, and the only one available is the report of the Board of Health to the Shah, dated February 24 th, 1 &amp; 97 , which refers to the channel for the communication of orders issued by the Berdan Government to the British quarantine doctor at Bushire. The papers referred to in the Legation reLjisters regarding an application by the then Grand Vizier for the services of Indian doctors and of the acquiescence by Sir M. Durand, cannot be found. M. Naus contended that the report of the Board of Health only gave His Majesty’s Legation the right to demand that copies of the orders sent by the Shah on quarantine matters to the Governor of Bushire should be com municated through the Legation to the Besidency Surgeon at the ports. His Excellency also argued that the British control w r as reelly merely over maritime quarantine, but did not extend to the control of the quarantine on the land side of Bushire. Sir A. Hardinge observed tl at the latter was a subsidiary question; the point of principle on our objection to the Customs department being the official channal of communication between the Persian Government and the British doctors, and the claim of the Director-General of Customs to issue orders to them on matters affecting quarantine. His Majesty’s Minister, although he had received no instructions from His Majesty’s Govern ment on that point, was personally of opinion that protection of Bushire against cholera or plague involved the exercise of control by the officer in charge of the maritime quarantine over the land approaches to the peninsular on which Bushire w as situated. Sir Arthur Hardinge later in the interview explained to the Grand Vizier that the Belgian Customs officials were certainly regarded in Southern Persia and by many persons in other parts of the country as inimical to British interests, and it was on that account that the Government of India resented the idea of the placing of our quarantine officers under their control. Subsequently, at the request of Sir A. Hardinge, and after the departure of M. Naus for Europe, the Grand Vizier instructed the Belgian Customs 4tion of the following:— Concessions in Peksia during 1904. The report on Concessions for the year 190 5 holds good, with the excep- Telephone Concession granted to the Moayer-ul-Mamalek Burin' 1904 the conoessionnaire has been trying to sell half the Con°- cession to the Bussian Bank, lie was forbidden to do so by the Persian Government, and so far as is known the sale has net been completed {vide Sir A. Hardinge’s Despatch No. 112 of June 18th, i.9u4). Tehran to Ahwaz Road Bakhtiari Road Astara to Ardebil Road Azarbaijan Road Caspian Sea Fisheries.—M. Nans has agreed to desist, in return for a fixed additional payment, from certain vexatious forms of interference with the Pishing Industry on the part of the Belgian Customs officials. His Excel lency is further trying to use this opportunity to obtain the payment of a fixed sum for the next three years in return for a proportionate reduction of the royaltie* due by M. Leonozoff for the remainder of the term of his agreement {vide Sir A. Hardinge’s Despatch No. 13 of January 19th, 1905). Automobiles and roads not yet ceded to others. The negotiations for the acquisition of this concession by a French Syndicate are stated to have lapsed in 1903. The following additional Concession has been granted during 1904 Automobile Concession, granted May 22nd, 1904, to Morteza Kuli Khan, Sani-ed-Dowleh, for 20 years from date of signature. During August 1904, the concessionnaire was trying to obtain a loan of £18,010 from the Imperial Bank of Persia. The Bank refused to lend the money unless repayment was guaranteed by His Majesty’s Legation. Nothing has as yet been done to give effect to the Concession. (For stipulations of the Concession, see Sir A. Hardinge’s Despatch No. 137 of July 24th, 1904). O. C.

Pasni {via Kathag Pass) ... ... 404 „ General .—The necessity for a connection between the Nushki-Seistan Railway and the coast may he urged on three grounds, each of sufficient importance to justify a thorough discussion of the subject. The first is purely a traffic argument, which is that, if circumstances should ever require us to carry on simultaneous campaigns at the Khojak and Seistan, the existing lines to Quetta would he unable to meet the strain. The point need not be discussed here at length; many may differ from this opinion ; hut it should he remembered in estimating *the carrying capacity of our frontier system, that no reliance should he placed on the Sind-Pishin State Railway, and that both it and the Mushkaf-Bolan State Railway will be liable to temporary interruptions of traffic through breaches in pipe lines, and damage to bridges or tunnels, the acts of local malcontents, possibly instigated by our enemies. We should he unwarrantably sanguine in expecting that the actual performance of these railways in time of war, with the possibility of slips at Mud Gorge, and breaks at any point, would ever be more than a moderate fraction of that shown in a working Time Table, compiled on the hypothesis that everything runs as smoothly in war as in peace. The second is a strategic argument, and has been mentioned in the report of the Nushki-Seistan Railway, namely, the advantage of a second line of advance and retreat, and of a second base of supplies for an army operating near Seistan. There is scarcely room for a difference of opinion on this point! A reference to the map shows how hazardous (without this stiffener) any lar^-e movements would be, say, at Robat, the end of a long unsupported line, parallel throughout its length to a possibly hostile frontier; and how the defence of the railway might, under certain circumstances, consume a large proportion of our forces. Finally, there is the desirability of defending the Makran frontier against any possibility of invasion from the west, and of strengthening our hold on that country. Though these objects appear different, it will be seen hereafter that they really merge into one another. Speaking from the point of view of a mere traveller, there can be no denying the fact that our status in Western Baluchistan is far from satisfactory. The inhabitants are obsessed by Russia to an almost incredible degree. Every day I heard some new and absurd rumour of her movements. That an army had assembled at Jalk, that three Russian transports had arrived in Karachi, with twelve, eight, and six thousand troops on board, who had disembarked, and w^ere advancing to the conquest of India; and so on. The foundation of fact for the last was probably the arrival in Karachi of a Russian man-of-war. A solitary Russian traveller was some where in the neighbourhood of Jalk. Childish as are these rumours, they show that our strength is little known and respected, and that our approaching defeat by Russia is looked on as inevitable. We no longer keep a British officer in the country as an outward sign of our authority, and were the Russians to post a smart Consul on our Mnkran frontier, the influence he might obtain over our Baluch tribes would have very serious consequences. Even granting that an invasion in force by way of Makran need scarcely be thought of for many years to come, a very awkward diversion might be made in that quarter, by small forces advancing up the Kech and Panjgur valleys, well supplied with money and rifles for distribution among the tribesmen. A rising thus fomented might assume dangerous pro portions, and extend to the tribes near Kalat. °2 The foregoing picture may be considered alarmist, but a review of our dealings with Western Baluchistan will show how little cause its inhabitants have for fearing us. A punitive e^edition, following some spasmodic out break, and bringing an influx of wealth to all owners of transport animals, and perhaps increased pay and position to the offenders, is a very mild deterrent. Will it be surprising then if the population knowing from experience that there is nothing to fear from us, in case of failure, side with our enemies whom they have every reason to dread ? On the other hand, with a railway through Makran, and our rule firmly established there, our influence would naturally extend over all the cognate tribes in South-Eastern Persia. Assuming, therefore, that we intend to maintain an active policy in Seistan and on the Persian const (and the whole case for a railway on the alignment now proposed rests on that assumption), the question w ould rather appear to be what route should the railway follow than whether it is necessary or not. In this connection the first point for decision is the position of the termini, in other words, the best place for the junction with the Quetta-Nushki-Seistan Bailway, and the choice of a port on the coast. Junction with Xushti-Seistan Railway .—A reference to the map will show that Kondi, or somewhere in its vicinity, is the most suitable position for the junction. A nearer approach to the western extremity of the Nushki- Seistan line would be unnecessary and dangerous, while a point appreciably further east wnuld leave too great an unsupported length of railway towards Bobat. In short, Kondi is a compromise, the objects in view being that the external sides of the quadrilateral formed by the Quetta-Kondi, Kondi coast, and Karachi to Quetta lines should be reasonably secure, while the “ business end of the railway from the junction towards the Persian frontier, w 7 here exposure to attack is greatest, should be as short as is consistent with the safety of the lines leading from the junction to the bases. / Th 0 drawback of Kondi as a junction is its presumably bad water-supply (winch has been mentioned in a previous report). This is unavoidable, and must be accepted unless the junction be made at Ek Mach, 70 miles nearer usk i, or the Nushki-Seistan alignment take an enormous detour to the south through the Mashkhel Harnun where water is abundant. Neither of these alternatives is recommended. . I ’ or l t . 0,1 coast—Several ports on the coast have been recommended at various times for the terminus, but the only two that, under existing conditions, need be considered are those in our own or Kalat territory, viz., Karachi and As each may have supporters, I thought it desirable to investigate align- 2Vn.— Both Colonel McMahon and Major Showers meilts and prepare estimates for both ^Vtee with me as to Karachi being the bettor of the projects with a view to an examination of their comparative advantages and disadvantages. Karachi requires no description. It is well known to every one interested ^ le ma e .^ as a c l ass port, as well as a military and railway base in connection with all the broad gauge systems of India. Pasni is a small village of 150 mat huts standing on the shores of a creseen -s tape ay facing the east. Its inhabitants gain their livelihood by « eXI) °. ln ^ Marks’ fins and the inside of a certain fish, which is used, I believe, in the manufacture of Isinglass. The water-supply is said to be abundant, but a visitor would scarcely think it so, to judge from the wells, shallow excavations three or four feet deep, into which the water slowly oozes. in J me ^ iatel y in re ar is a mass of moving sandhills, one of ^ eaten ?v alr ^ ad y to swallow up the telegraph bungalow.

S ° s . iadow tl^t vessels of moderate draft would have to i e mi es lomthe shore, and, unless sheltered by a long breakwater, would be exposed to the force of the south-west monsoon. rail ^ nd t a Company s Gulf steamers have lately begun to call there, and I fortunately met the second the day I spent at Pasni.

The accompanying chart for which I have to thank the British India Company, otnl 'l T T fZ Se ! erS / n B ° mba y or Karachi, shows very clearly how exposed the five-fathom line (now only the four-fathom) is to the south and ’ a ? d ex ,^ nsl ? j 4 wil1 be t0 ooovert the place into a secure a chorage unless the facilities of the port are confined to small coasting steamers. Even they, under present conditions, will be compelled to put to sea, and be unable to land either passengers or cargo, whenever an easterly gale springs -further information is required, reference might be made to the British India Company, whose Captains on that run will know after the monsoon what eilect the swell has on ships in the bay. From the preceding description it is obvious that Pasni in its present state is an impossible terminus for any railway at all, but more particularlv for a strategic railway where the one desideratum is facility of uninterrupted workino- under ail condttions of weather. It is true, as will be seen from the estimates, that the cost of the bare alignment from Kondi to Pasni is considerably less than that between Kondi and Karachi, but no account has been taken of the enormous outlay, which, it will have been realised, will be required to convert what is now little better than an open shallow roadstead into an important military and railway base. A breakwater, port defences, jetties and their equipment, railway carriage and locomotive shops, quarters, and a number of other items which I am quite unable to estimate for. Ihe railway terminal works would certainly absorb twenty to thirty lakhs. Note, -it is difficult to ascertain, even approxi- (The block account of the North-Western Railway at Karachi cannot be less than 1 v A « . _ _ mately, what similar harbours in India have cost. At Madras, where at any rate there is the advantage of deep water inshore, the expenditure appears to be considerably over a crore. I am endeavouring to get the figures of the Karachi Harbour block account, but it is doubtful if they can be furnished with any degree of accuracy owing to the different agencies that have been at work at various times. If I can get them in sufficient detail hereafter, they can be printed in the appendix. They will give, ceteris paribvs, some idea of the probable outlay required at Pasni. A breakwater on the east coast of India has recently been estimated at Ks. 1,000 per foot; in a locality where the conditions as regards materials were favourable. •J crore.) A breakwater two miles lorn would cost more than a crore, w r hile jetties, cranes, sidings, barges, &amp;c., would run to several lakhs if carried out on an adequate scale. There is, therefore, little room for doubt that the saving in the cost of the Pasni alignment would be swallowed up in the works at the port. In a project for a strategic railway, military consider ations should, however, be paramount, and too much stress* should not be laid on small differences in economy between rival schemes. I should, therefore, state what appear to be decisive objections to Pasni as a terminus :— (a) In time of war it will be an additional port to protect. (Z&gt;) It is separated from our Indian railway system by 200 miles of sea, so all troops and supplies will be subjected to the risk and delay of having to be conveyed by transports. A railway from Karachi to Kondi is free from these drawbacks, and affords speed and security to the work of mobilisation. Karachi is, moreover, the natural terminus of a future Indo-European line (should that ever be built), whether it go by Makran or Herat. Further, the alignment to Karachi, while sacrificing no point of importance, is less exposed to attack than that to Pasni; for the latter, in turning to the west up the Kech valley, is vulnerable from the north owing to the re-entrant angle of the Persian frontier, whereas the former is safer and more compact, as it is retired to the east from the point where the Kech Kolwa valley is entered; while the populous part of Kech, from Turbat westwards, can be protected by a feeder line, with some real commercial prospects, running up the valley as far as Tump, on the same principle as the Kondi-Seistan branch. For it seems that the essential features of a well designed frontier system are that it should radiate towards the frontier from a secure base, run parallel to the frontier only so far as it can with safety, and then return to its original starting point, or to some similar base connected vith the first by an interior line of railway. Its most exposed portions on the frontier should be protected4 as far as possible by short branches and roads to points where danger threatens, so that through communications should be as little liable to interruption as the nature of things will permit. * It should not be forgotten, however, that one of the objects of a line through Makran is to control the tribes within our border, and in this connec tion the Pasni alignment may claim some advantage, as it encloses a larger area of Baluchistan. I may, therefore, state that, with the exception of the Kech valley (undoubtedly the richest part of Makran), which I propose dealing with by a branch, the Karachi alignment embraces every district of importance in the country. Even the Pasni-Turbat line would require a branch about 40 miles long to Tump in order to command the centre of disturbance and to tap the trade of the valley, as Turbat is quite at its eastern extremity. It may be urged that the Karachi alignment is faulty, as it leaves the tract between Kolwa and the sea unguarded ; and Alexander the Great’s march along the coast may be quoted as showing the possible danger of neglecting this strip. This objection is easily answered. Alexander had command of the sea, and yet his army was only rescued from starvation by opportune supplies from Kandahar or Seistan. I do not think any invader would be so foolish and mis guided as to enter that almost waterless waste of ravines and mountain. It would only be to die of starvation and thirst, or to surrender to our forces operating from the railway to the north. A good road direct from Kolwa to Pasni would be sufficient protection for this strip. General description of country .—The question of the termini having now been disposed of, and my reasons for preferring Karachi stated at length, a brief general description of the country between Kondi and the sea appears desirable, as without it details of the proposed alignment will scarcely be intelligible. Western Baluchistan from Kondi southwards may be divided into two belts of markedly different characteristics; the northern and narrower being plain and glacis, and the southern a series of mountain ranges 150 miles in width. The former, which terminates in a line drawn from the debouchement of the Mashkhel river from the hills, through Palantak and Washuk, is the familiar waste of sand and stones. Its main feature is the Mashkhel Hamun, an ancient lake into which the rainfall of the surrounding country once drained, but whose waters now exist mainly in the imagination of the cartographer. Its level above the sea is only 1,000 feet, and the climate is said to be exceedingly hot in summer. A con siderable nomad population of camel-graziers and shepherds centres round the Hamun, and Ladgasht, a village on its borders, has fairly extensive date groves. A little land is cultivated near Rajib with the hood waters of the Mashkhel river. Prom Ladgasht caravan roads lead in every direction, to Jalk and Ladis, important centres in Persia, to the Helmund, Dalbandin, Kharan, and Panjgur. The Persian frontier is only a few miles off, and bends here from north-west to north. Erom the Hamun we ascend over plain and gradually steepening glacis till we meet the northern limit of the Makran ranges. Thence°to the coast three wide ranges intervene, separated by the two (narrow valleys of Rakshan-Panjgur and Kech-Kolwa. Their peaks exceed 5,000 feet, and their general elevation above the central valleys is from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. These mountains form the westerly continuation of the Khwaja Amran range, and jut out from its central axis below Nushki like the head of a hockey stick from its handle. Their geological formation is the same, grey blue slaty shales with bands of calcareous sandstone. The appearance and physical^ features of this tract are similar to those we are familiar with at the Khojak. The mountains are steep without being precipitous, their slopes are sound and free from slips, the strata are wonderfully contorted, and for the most part set on edge. Near the higher peaks and in deep gorges the shales have a very pronounced slaty fracture, while the proportion of rock is high. As we near the coast the bands of rock get thinner and softer, and the slaty fracture disappears. The shales degenerate into clays, and the hills, in spite of their grey blue tin^e,5 Hccm err? AlasfikeC remind one irresistibly of the red clay hills of Nari and Mushkaf. In fact, near Jhau and Pidaruk patches of red clay appear overlying the blue shales. A curious characteristic of these ranges is that their highest peaks, instead of being in the centre of each range, form two continuous lines bordering on tbe plains, while their interior is a confused series of parallel ridges of lower altitude and softer material than the outer barrier. A section of the country from north to south is, therefore, something like the sketch. ° Owing to the parallelism of these interior ridges, the smaller nullas generally flow from east to west, while here and there a large river bursts through the outer borrier through a long, difficult, and generally tortuous gorge. It will be easily understood that a railway through a country of this description is an exceedingly formidable work, and that a ruling grade of 1—40 to 1—50 is tbe best we can hope to obtain. The population is almost entirely nomad, and, in consequence of the preceding years of drought, exceedingly scanty. I was astonished at the absence of inhabitants. At Nushki I was told, in answer to my enquiries, that they had migrated to Kharan. In Kharan I was told they had gone on to Panjgur. At Panjgur I was told that I should find them all in Kech. At Kech they were said to have gone to Karachi. Such inhabitants as there are, subsist on their flocks of sheep and goats, and, to a certain extent, in Kharan at least, on grass. In south Makran there are large numbers of camels. In the villages donkeys are fairly numerous. Cattle are scarce everywhere. The flora of the country is a curious mixture of the plants of the hot and cold zones of Baluchistan. Thus we find the acacia and madar bush of Sindh growing side by side with the camel scrub of the Quetta plateau. In good seasons there is abundant pasturage among the hills for camels, sheep, and horses ; in the “ kaps ” (or depressions whence the rain water has no exit) the scrub and grass are really luxuriant. The horses belonging to my party were turned out to graze at every camping ground, and found plenty of grass the whole way from Nushki to Karachi, except between Kech and Pasni, where the mountains (and plains too) are phenomenally barren, and the only* grazing is in the nulla beds and “ kaps ”. The hills are everywhere bare of trees; but tamarisk and acacia are common in the plains, and the nulla beds are covered with the palmetto. Practically the only settlements in the country are in the Panjgur and Kech-Kolwa valleys, where alone supplies are procurable, even in modest quantities. (The unimportant villages of Jhau and the comparatively fertile district of Bela lying to the east are, of course, excluded from this general description of the country between Kondi and the coast.) Panjgur* is the name given to a collection of three villages (the most import- • Fide Appendix. antof which is Isa Kalat), with a total population perhaps of 3,000 souls. The produce of the valley consists of dates grown along the stony edge of the Bak- shan Eiver. Water is obtained partly from the riverbed, where at the time of6 my visit there was a considerable surface flow, but mainly from Ivarezes in the low hills on each bank. The length of this oasis is about 5 miles, its width from ^ to J a mile. Little patches of wheat, lucerne, and vegetables are grown in openings among the date trees, but some grain also comes fromKolna, Lharan, and Nushki. The staple food of the villagers and of the surrounding nomad tribes is dates. There are at most two lakhs of bearing trees in the valley, and their annual produce is approximately a lakh of maunds = 3,700 tons.. The bulk of the crop is consumed locally, or bartered with the nomads for ghi and wool, but a small quantity of the ‘better dates is exported to Nushki and Karachi. The primitiveness of the country will be best understood from the tact that there were only five banias in the three villages. Panjgur is the hill station for all the wealthier people of Makran. The climate is remarkably cool for the elevation, 3,000 feet; cooler, I thought, than places of corresponding altitude near Quetta. Further up the valley water is no longer met with in the river, and is only obtainable from springs at the base of the mountains. In places there is a little “ barani ” cultivation from the streams that descend from the hills on both sides. One of the two feasible routes for an invader leads from the Persian frontier at Kuhak, four marches off, through Isa Kalat and up the Rakshan to Kalat and Quetta. There is said to be only one severe Kotal on the whole road. The foregoing description of Panjgur applies equally, mutatis mutandis, to Kech. The latter valley is much hotter being at an elevation of only 500 feet or less, and the hills are closer on either hand. Water is plentiful all along the Kech (Kilkaur) Ptiver from Turbat, the capital, westwards to Tump, a distance of 40 miles. A dozen fair-sized villages with their fringe of date trees line the edge of the river, and the population is much larger than that of Panjgur, amounting probably to 12,000 inhabitants. The Nazim of Kech informed me that the Khan of Kalat owns four lakhs of trees in the valley. On the assump- ee ppen ix. tion, which is probably within the mark, that one-half of all the trees are his property, the total number would be eight lakhs, and their produce about four lakhs of maunds yearly=15,000 tons. A little rice and lucerne are grown in patches among the date trees, and there are gardens of orange trees and mangoes. 1 did .ot go beyond Turh.t, .„d port of tbi. There are excellent Karezes at Turbat, description is from information obtained from the but lower down, I understood, the water Kazim ’ was mainly derived from the river. Here too the staple food of the inhabitants is dates. A considerable quantity goes to the ports of Ormara and Gwadur, en route, it is said, for Karachi, but the bulk of the crop is consumed locally or bartered with the nomads for ghi and wool. With improved communications there can be no doubt that a large export of dates would spring up, with an import of grain in exchange. The people would very much prefer the latter if it could be got. So sick were they of a perpetual diet of dates, which recent failures of their rain crops had restricted them to, that I found a ration of flour had a much greater attraction for guides and camelmen than a daily wage. As the price of dates in Kech is annas 8 to 12 per maund and in India Rs. 5 to 10 per maund, there would be a wide margin of profit on the transaction. The climate is hot and unhealthy; fever and cholera being prevalent before the date season (July-August). It is difficult to estimate heat when living in a small tent, but I consider Kech, though cooler than Sibi or Jhansi, is quite as hot as Cawnpore. Some twenty miles east of Turbat, in the same valley, are the two isolated villages of Sami and Sharak, with fifteen or twenty thousand date trees. Their main water-supply is from a Karez, but a little is obtained from tire river. Further east again, at Herokh and Oshap, there is a slight surface flow in the river and small patches of rice on its banks. Elsewhere from Turbat eastwards to the Kilkaur Tangi, on the borders of Kolwa, water is only found in large pools in the riverbed, though there is probably a flow through the shingle.7 :es in the ts width openings Tan, and tribes is md their Ihe bulk md wool, Karachi, fact that 11 station cool for ; altitude he river, [n places from the 3 Persian vshan to ole road. andis, to 500 feet all along Tump, a late trees that of mr lakhs assump- ic mark, be eight tons.

Its staples are barley and millet, and the total produce of an ordinary year, in spite of its enormous area and possibilities, does not exceed 600 tons. With a little energy on the part of the cultivators in repairing bunds, &amp;c., now in a lamentable state of ruin, that quantity might be increased ten-fold. The inhabitants are confined to a few little villages or kalats, and depend upon rather deep and indifferent we'Is for their drinking supply. The second route for an invader from Persia runs through this Kech- Kolwa valley, and converges with the Panjgur road to Kalat near the head of the Mashkai Kiver. With the exception of these two thoroughfares (for we may exclude the roads fiom Ladgasht through Dalbandin or Kharan as too waterless), no other roads lead east and west along which troops could be moved. It may be considered that Madak Kalat in Kolwa, where the Karachi alignment enters the plain, is too remote from the frontier to guard this route effectually, without the addition of a branch from Kolwa to Tump. While on political and commercial grounds I am strongly in favour of building a branch to Tump, as it would be very cheaply constructed and would prove a valuable feeder line, and at least pay working expenses from the begin ning, besides exerting a powerful political influence in Persian Baluchistan, I don’t think it should be considered an integral part of the scheme of defence. For the Madak position per se gives every advantage to the defenders. Except after heavy rains where pools are to be met with in fields whose bunds are still intact, the stretch of 30 miles from the Kech Biver at Kilkaur Tangi to the railway is practically waterless. Even in peace time a force would have to march through Kolwa in detachments; it is difficult then to see how it could make good its advance in the face of troops supported by a railway in rear. It is on political and commercial grounds, rather than strategic, that the Kech valley branch is essential. Before concluding this general description of Makran, a few words concerning the tract between Kech and the coasts may not be out of place, in explanation of the comparative cheapness of the line from Turbat to Pasni. Ihough similar in geological formation to the ranges to the north, this third range is much less' formidable; the ridges between its outer barriers are lower and further apart, while between the ridges are wide expanses of sloping, stony plain. The country is unusually sterile, partly because of its greater heat and more scanty rainfall, but mainly, I believe, on account of the change in the strata from hard rock and slaty shales to soft rock and clay shales. The striking features of the country are its wide, deep nulla beds and great stretches of ravines. Both proceed from the same cause,—the absence of rock and the friability of the shales. In places the plain seems to melt away into a series of sugar loaf mounds, like the banks of the Chambal near Dholpur or of the Jumna at Kalpi. These ravines, though impracticable for anyone on foot (at least in the hot weather), are in places not at all difficult for a railway; and the main head of expense in this portion of the line will be in the matter of bridging. The foregoing general description may serve to convey some idea of Western Baluchistan from a Bailway Engineer’s standpoint. Before proceed ing to give details of the alignments, works, curves, &amp;c., a little further account of the inhabitants may be of interest. The men of the country from Panjgur south are lusty and well shaped. It was remarkable how much bigger and heavier they were than the grain-eating Baluchis round Isushki and Quetta. There is a large admixture of Negro blood amor' the inhabitants of the villages, but the nomads are fairly free from the taint. The dominant religion is Muhammadanism, but among the tribes round Kech Zigriism is exceedingly prevalent. Its tenets are a worship to the Mullas, who claim at marriages the rights of a French Seigneur over8 his tenants* daughters ; its rites consist of certain secret orgies, during which the worshippers, both men and women, sit round in a circle clapping their hands and shouting till they reach a state of frenzy. The Zigris* Mecca is a sacred hill near Turbat, on which grew the sacred tree in which the book of their religion was first discovered by the founder of their faith. During the late famine some pious Muhammadans, who, of course, regard Zigriism with abhorrence, cut down the tree for fodder. Owing to frequent persecutions in the past, they will almost invariably deny their religion when first questioned. In other matters too they appeared to me to be the most unblushingly mendacious race I had ever met. But they proved excellent guides. They know the country thoroughly, their intelligence is far beyond that of the half African dwellers of the villages, and they really seem to grasp the sort of country that a railway officer wishes to see. The fact is well worth noting by future railway survey parties; for intelligent guides may save months of work in an unknown, indifferently mapped country. Details of alignment from “ Kondi to Karachi i” important works, grades, curves, fyc. From Kondi, B. L. 2,800, the line runs almost south to Ladgasht, B. L. 1,600, a distance of 72 miles. As far as Gwalishtan, which is about half-way, the country traversed is a barren glacis of fine shingle. At Gwalishtan, in the centre of the Mashkhel Hamun, a good supply of brackish water is obtainable from wells, three or four feet deep, and there is a fairly dense jungle of tamarisk trees. Between Gwalishtan and Ladgasht are patches of shora, “ pat*’, and sandy plain covered with scrub; in places the surface of the ground is slightly broken by nullas. From Ladgasht to Palantak, 79 miles, the line runs to the south-east over dasht and glacis covered with grit and shingle. On the left, some two or three miles off, are large sandhills; on the right, the talus of the mountains. There are no nullas here till the Mashkhel Biver is reached, where 600' of waterway will be required. Its banks are well defined, from 15' to 20' high, formed of hard shingle and conglomerate. Its catchment area is vast, extending into the mountains 150 miles to east and west but narrow from north to south. Beyond this crossing the glacis is broken by two large nullas, the Bibi 2 t.b. Kaur=river. Lori and the Filin Kaur, which flow in several small channels between outer banks, some 30 ft. high. [I should state that I have not ridden over the 150 miles of plain from Kondi to Palantak. It was imperative that I should complete the Seistan reconnaissance to Nushki. Thence to save time I marched straight to Palantak via Kharan and Washuk, leaving my surveyor to do the reconnais sance from Kondi to Palantak. He is an excellent man, and his work can he thoroughly relied on. Owing to information I received, I ordered him to ascend the Mashkhel Biver from the Hamum so as to avoid the sandhills which were said to cover the glacis. In doing so he ran into the very difficulty he wished to escape; for these sandhills in places line the river bank on both sides, while the glacis is free from sand. Unfortunately, in obedience to my orders, the barometric section was taken along this route. Being along what has proved to be the wrong alignment, it is not submitted. Afterwards, on finding this route so bad, he investigated the alignment now put forward, but for reasons which need not be explained was unable to complete a continuous section. In such easy country, indeed, it was hardly necessary.] At Palantak, B. L. 2,200, where there is a small flow of water in the nullah, a hut, and a few young date trees, the Ghat section of the line may be regarded as beginning. Thence the alignment ascends the bank of the river over rather rough ground for six miles till the Palantak Tangi or gorge is reached.9 This gorge is an obligatory point on any railway from Kondi or its neighbourhood to the coast, as it affords the only feasible route through the outer barrier of the Kharan-Panjgur range. My surveyor examined the Zurrat Tangi, one of the two defiles of the Mashkhel River, and found it impracticable, owing to its lofty precipitous cliffs and rapid windings {vide drawing attached). He reported to the same effect of the Bibi Lori (or Maki) Tangi, a report which I subsequently verified. The river is a series of zig-zags, its banks rise steeply for several hundred feet, the strata are contorted in every direction and crushed by the superincumbent weight of the mass above. The Korkian Tangi to the east is longer and worse than the Palantak. I may mention that the 4 miles=l' / maps show the nullas about here incorrectly; time did not permit of my correcting them. It may be added indeed that in many important places, the hills and nullas are so sketchily mapped that it is impossible to make the plan agree with the section. In such cases where the report and section speak of a plain, while the line on the plan is drawn through a hill, the latter may be regarded as imaginary. With the exception of the descent down the Siri Kaur into Bela, and perhaps of the tunnel and approaches at the Madak Pass, which will bo described hereafter, the five miles of the Palantak defile is the heaviest section of the line. The grade is fairly; easy otherwise it is a Bolan Pass in miniature, but narrower and more precijntous. Portunately the river is fairly straight, the strata are hard and vertical, while rock appears all along the bed of the river. Where, therefore, cuttings in the hillside w r ould be costly, long stretches can be built with a low retaining wall on surface foundations —vide sketch. The roadbed will be secure and free from slips whether in cutting or in retaining wall. Possibly water may prove too scarce for anything, but a mini mum of masonry, in which case retaining walls would be out of the question, and even the bridges might with advantage be American steel trestles. In ordinary seasons there is generally a trickle through the gorge, but in time of drought the nearest permanent sources of supply are at Palantak, six miles from its northern mouth, and at Palantak Thana at its southern end. The accompanying traverse, on which, merely to fix ideas, a line has been sketched, gives some impression of the character of the works. It shows nine crossings of the river, four short tunnels, and J a mile of retaining wall. It should, however, be clearly understood that the alignment does not purport to be even approximately correct: in fact, it is much too cheap in places for safety. Beyond the Tangi the alignment continues to follow the Ladgasht-Panjgur caravan road. The first six or seven miles are ordinary medium heavy line in hilly country with considerable bridging in small spans. The ruling grade through the gorge and up to this point is 1—70 to 1—80. At the 7th mile from Palantak Thana the line crosses a watershed amon' the hills where a short tunnel and some expensive development in a basin below the Kotal are necessary in order to obtain 1—50. Between this inter mediate Kotal and the watershed of the range at Dambodin, R. L. 4,040, the grade is easy, but the earthwork and minor bridging will be heavy. Dambodim is an awkward Kotal for the Railway Engineer; long flat, and unavoidable. A heavy cutting will be necessary through it, with possibly a short tunnel or cut and cover towards Panjgur, in order to ease the descent of the Sagari Sing nulla down which the alignment runs for 6J miles.10 The nulla flows in a rather deep bed in a narrow valley between two high ridges. These ridges are too close to permit of much development; the valley is rough and fissured by streams from each side, so the descent is moderately difficult, and the best grade obtainable will probably be little better than the slope of the nulla bed, say, 1—50 to 1—55. At Sagari Sing, where white quartz reefs among the rocks in the bed of the river give the name to the place, the line leaves the valley and turns sharp to the right. Thenceforth the country opens on either hand, and the work gradually gets lighter till as the Rakshan valley is neared at Panjgur, R. L. 3,100, the last few miles are over the usual easy glacis. The Rakshan River between the villages of Khodabadan Tasp and Isa Kalat is a wide sprawling torrent without any apparent banks. Its bed is, of coarse shingle, and full of quicksands after floods. When I saw it, the surface flow of water was considerable, quite 50 cubic feet per second, but that was shortly after heavy rain. The underground flow must be great. The width of the river varies from J to ^ a mile, but its waters in flood are shallow. Perhaps the best site for a bridge would be above the uppermost village, Khodabadan, where the channel of the river might be confined. If the direct route to Isa Kalat be taken, the bridge would be J mile long: short spans, on low piers with shallow founds and a drop wall. (Training works are not suited to the conditions here, and might lead to trouble with the owners of the date groves.) The bed of the river slopes sufficiently for tail races to be effective, so the foundations should not be troublesome. I paid very little attention to the choice of a site for this bridge, for, as will be realised when I describe the alternative route via the Gorandi Pass, it is not by any means certain from which direction the line will approach Isa Kalat. Gorandi Pass alternative .—Peeling dissatisfied with the line along the cara\ an road from Palantak Ihana over the Dambodim, I examined two passes to the west leading from Panjgur into a depression or Kap called Dostanzai, and thence to the Palantak defile. One of these, the Ghulam Shah, was barely practicable and calls for no further remark ; but the second, the Gorandi, proved much easier than the Dambodim. There is little to choose in actual cost between these two routes, for though the works on the Gorandi are much lighter, and the grades somewhat better than via the Dambodim, the length of the line is about 15 miles greater, that is, if we bring the railway to Isa Kalat, as I think we should do (vide plan). It will be observed that the Gorandi Kotal is 500 feet lower than the Dambodim, but that, on the other hand, the alignment over the former has to cross a subsidiary watershed between the Bibi Lori and Palantak Rivers, so that the total rise and fall of the two routes is practically identical. The 12 miles between these two Tangis is over glacis scarred with* deepish nullas; in fact, the action of the Tangis on the surrounding country resembles that of two separate sluice gates draining a muddy pond. There will be a good deal of small span bridging along this ^ alignment, but the other works will be Imht enough except near the Gorandi Kotal. Even there the heavy works only extend for 7 or 8 miles and are not formidable. The descent to Panigur is much easier than would appear from the barometric section down the Gorandi nulla, as development is comparatively simple (vide sketch). o Is a KclLclC'11 Two short tunnels will probably be found necessary, and two or three crossings of the nulla. Before detailed surveys of either alignment are put in hand, a fortnight should be spent in levelling over and examining both routes. In my opinion there is little to choose between the two, and if 1—50 can be obtained via the caravan road without prohibitive works below Sorenkik, and no appreciably better grade is obtainable via the Grorandi Pass, there will be no need to stake out both lines. I confess to a prejudice in favour of the Gorandi route, but that was probably because I discovered it. Alignment from Panjgur to Kolwa .—Prom Panjgur two alignments suggested themselves. One running approximately north and south to Kolwa, and the other following the direct caravan road to Karachi in a south-easterly direction. I adopted the former on several grounds,—political, strategic, and engineering. Pirst, it obviously encloses a greater area of Baluchistan; second, it intersects the Kech-Kolwa route, 50 miles nearer the Persian frontier; third, it is a sound principle in Ghat Railway engineering to cross the mountains by the shortest possible route, regardless, within wide limits, of extra length of line. There are some 80 miles of hilly country on the direct route via the Latari Pass, as compared with 50 via that adopted. I may add that at Panjgur my surveyor met Mr. Wilson of the Indo-European Telegraphs, who was surveying for a telegraph line from Karachi to Kuhak, and had marched through by the Latari route. He reported it as impracticable for a railway and not even fit for a telegraph line. Prom Isa Kalat, therefore, the alignment runs south-west diagonally across the valley to Chib, so as to avoid a range that the caravan road to Shahbaz Kalat and Kolwa crosses. Prom Chib it turns south-east, and, after continu ing in plain up to the 28th mile from Isa Kalat, begins to ascend the northern Kotal of the range between the Rakshan valley and Kolwa. Near Wash Jaurakin Spring, mile 228 and 33 miles from Isa Kalat, there will be a small tunnel where the alignment joins the caravan road, but possibly this can be avoided by making a wider sweep to the west before beginning the ascent. The grade and works of the north approach of the Wash Jaurakin Kotal, mile 231, R. L. 3,400, are easy. On the descent the alignment should not follow the caravan road, but take a footpath to the right over the Istirgi Kotal. There is some heavy work among ridges for about five miles even on a 1—50 grade. At mile 237 the main ridges are cleared, and thenceforth, for 25 miles, till the corresponding barrier overlooking Kolwa is reached, the line is fre quently on easy stretches of glacis and plain. The route along which the barometric section has been taken is the Panjgur-Madak-Kalat caravan road, and requires very little description. The open country is broken by numerous parallel ridges, many of them lofty and continuous, but negotiable here and there at nulla gorges and low Kotals. At mile 249 near Gumbak the line to Pasni bifurcates to the south-west. One or two short reverse grades occur where the road crosses from valley to valley, but they are easily dealt with and call for no special remark. With this exception, there is a general fall in the alignment till we reach the Kil Kaur (mile 281, R. L. 2,500), the principal river of the country, at the foot of the ascent to the Madak Pass. The bridge would be of ordinary short spans on open founds in shale and rock. A fairly good crossing about 1,200 feet wide will be got } of a mile below the caravan road. The works on the Madak Pass, R. L. 3,200, are of an exceedingly formidable nature. Prom the 265th to the 275th mile the mountains are continuous. The line I suggest follows the Madak River closely, on a 1—45 grade. Develop ment is possible on the north approach in one or two places where the ridges are far enough apart for the railway to turn between them, and certain points dotted on the section indicate where this can be done; but the expense in obtaining a better grade than 1—45 or 1—50 will probably prove prohibitive. I propose to negotiate the summit wdth a tunnel, 1J miles long. With a little care KciLai’12 in aligning it, a good shaft might he got near its centre, dividing it into two f- mile tunnels. The rock, hard Khojak shale, is admirably adapted for tunnelling. A good spring exists on the north approach, and one or two small ones in the nulla on. the south, so there will he no want of water. On the contrary, springs will probably he tapped in driving the heading. The descent from the summit tunnel to the Kolwa plain is similar in character to the ascent, only more costly. The cheapest route is to adhere to the slope of the nulla, bridging the stream where necessary. The first three miles will be exceedingly heavy, as the banks are high and steep. Fortunately, the nulla is fairly straight. An alternative method of negotiating this pass has been suggested by my surveyor. . It is to climb as high as possible on the north side, say, to a point 150 feet higher than I propose, and then cross the Kotal with two short tunnels. The descent is accomplished in a similar manner by a series of loops with short tunnels, where necessary, through the ridges. This alternative is certainly worth a trial. I rejected it at first sight on account of a lofty viaduct which would be required at the south tunnel mouth over the ravine below it: for the river at the tunnel entrance forks in both directions, and a viaduct is unavoidable. TWO TUNM£LS It is not likely that this alternative will result in any economy in construc tion, for the open patches between the ridges are indented with deep nullas, so the bridging and earthwork will be exceedingly heavy; but the great advan tage of this method, if it is feasible, is that it avoids that most objectionable feature in an alignment, a tedious un-get-at-able work in the centre of a long railway. For it will he easily understood that a tunnel of the length I pro'- pose, on which only a limited number of men can be employed, may bar the opening of through communications for a couple of years after the line on each side is complete. So, if two short tunnels are obtainable instead of one long one, they are much to be preferred, even at a slight increase of cost. Other wise, the heading of the long tunnel should be started by hand labour as an isolated work in advance, as soon as construction is begun at the termini. By these means the heading will probably he through by the time the rails on either side reach the tunnel. At the 274th mile, the works begin to get lighter. Between the 275th and 276th miles the river makes a sharp “ U ” bend, and, in order to avoid a double crossing, it might be diverted through a tunnel (vide sketch) , ^ r ^ rn fhe 277th mile the line need not follow the caravan road (alon 0, which the section was taken in the first instance), hut had better continue to descend the river almost to its debouchement on the plain (vide plan).13 Tins will probably prove a cheaper alignment (though it involves two short tunnels and perhaps three crossings of the Madak) than developino- among the foot hills, as the alternative along the caravan road would he con£ polled to do, to obtain the ruling gradient. Both routes should be levelled over and carefully examined before either is definitely settled upon. A comparison between an alignment down a gorge or narrow valley, and one developino* on a rough hillside, is very difficult from a mere reconnaissance. The bridging and tunnelling of the former, though short, often prove more expensive Than continuous heavy earthwork in bank and cutting. In fact a gor^e route, though generally easy to build, and giving the best grade, often turns out much more costly than it looks at first sight. . .. ^ no ^ er point is that it is impossible from a reconnaissance to localise individual works in a gorge route. Eor in such cases, when a difficulty arises, the Railway Engineer has three courses open—m., a bridge over the nullah, a retaining wall in it, or a tunnel; and it is only by detailed surveys that he can ascertain the cheapest method of dealing with the difficulty. *The reconnais sance officer can only judge from previous experience, and by a comparison with railways in similar country, whether the route as a whole is feasible or not, and what its probable cost will be. Before finishing the description of the Madak Pass, I wish to draw atten tion to an error in the 4 miles =1' Trigonometrical Survey map in showing the Kotal at least 1,000 feet lower than it really is, thus conveying the impression that there was only 400 feet of fall to the Kolwa plain instead of 1,400. A mistake of this sort, which could be avoided with a little care in checking the sheet, may cause a lot of trouble and delay. This is not the only place where the levels are incorrect. In the left hand top corner of the same sheet are two equally misleading levels—m., at Shahbaz Kalat and below the Istirgi Kotal. These mistakes are obvious, once discovered; but they shake one’s faith in all Trigonometrical Survey barometric levels. Alternatives to Madak route—As the Madak Pass proved so unsatisfac tory, an alternative was tried via the Wehli nulla and Malar Kalat, but found impracticable. A second alternative, via the Kilkaur at Tang-i-Pusht and Nag Kalat, was the route first selected for the railway to Pasni, and will be described when dealing with that alignment. Suffice it to say for the present, that, unless the Military Department express a strong preference for the Madak route, lines over both passes should be staked out by separate survey parties. Alignment from Kolwa to Jhau.—From its debouchement on the Kolwa plain near Madak Kalat (R. E. 1,800 and mile 280), the line is a surface one for 40 miles as far as Mandai Af. Its general bearing is east, and it crosses Kolwa in a diagonal direction via Hor Kalat and Regchahi. In the centre of the plain is a long narrow ridge which can either be rounded, or negotiated at one of its numerous openings. A low bank may be necessary through the “ Kap ” where water appears to stand two or three feet deep after heavy rain. At Mandai Af, R. L. 2,100, the third range between Kondi and the coast is encountered. Thence to the crossing of the Nal River near Jhau there extends a conti nuous stretch of rough hills and ridges about 36 miles in width. The align ment follows the Las Bela caravan road except where otherwise stated. Its most notable feature is that it crosses the main drainage of the country and has consequently a considerable amount of rise and fall in passing from valley to valley, and two good-sized bridges, the Paho (or Mashkai) and Nal.The sketch explains the general character of the alignment, ascending and descending the small tributaries of the main rivers, running for the most part parallel to the ridges, but crossing them every here and there. The works on the whole are not as expensive as might be anticipated, the heaviest hits being (1) at the Garmaf Kotals (R. L. 2,500, mile 322) through two adjacent ridges above Mandai Af where two short tunnels will be required; and (2) the descent of the Masjid nulla from Masjid Ziarat into Jhau, miles 347 to 352. On the section will be found full details of the nature of the country traversed. It should be specially noted that the line should not follow the caravan road in the descent from the above-mentioned tunnels to the Paho River, mile 332, as that route involves a third Kotal, and is prohibitively steep; but should descend the Garm Af nulla as shown on the section. Again between Masjid Ziarat and Jhau the caravan road is impracticable for a railway, as it ascends an awkward Kotal. The correct alignment is to follow the Masjid nulla either as far as mile 351, and then strike to the left across the foothills ; or else to its debouchement on the Jhau glacis a mile or two further on. The section follows the first alternative, but the second will probably prove better. For four miles below Ziarat, the earthwork will be heavy, and there will be some small span bridging; but the hills on both sides of the nulla are in the main low and of soft material, so, though the stream winds abruptly, it can hardly be called a defile. The central portion of this tract from the foot of the Garm Af Kotal to Ziarat is not at all difficult. The principal work is the bridge over the Paho River 15x60. The catchment area of this river ranks next in size af f er the Mashkhel, but its basin is long and narrow, so its floods hardly seem so great as those in the Kil Kaur, whose basin, though smaller, is more compact. The river runs through a wide defile with high rocky banks. Between the banks are fairly stable patches of alluvial soil covered with tall jungle of tamarisk and acacia. Not far from the caravan road, rock (soft sandstone) stretches from side to side, so there should be no trouble in obtaining good foundations. There is plenty of water in pools in the riverbed, but no surface flow. No doubt, there is a good perennial flow through the shingle. The ruling grade between Mandaiaf and Jhau will be determined by the grade at the Garm Af Kotal. 1—50 is the best to be expected there. Elsewhere easier gradients could be obtained if there were any advantage in doing so. Alternative routes between Jhau and Kolwa will suggest themselves to the survey officers staking out the permanent line, viz .,— (a) From Jhau up the Seri (or Serd) Pass, and across Nondro to the north-east corner of Kolwa. (b) From Jhau via the present alignment as far as the Nondro crossing, mile 340, thence up the Nondro River and into Kolwa via (a) and avoiding the Garm Af Kotals. Both these routes are longer than that now under report, and in my opinion not likely to prove so good. My Jemadar of Levy Sowars, a Brahui Sardar who had accompanied Major Showers over route (a) last year, gave a very bad account of the passes on it, more particularly of the Seri, but Major Showers has since assured me that in his opinion they are not impracticable. («) is certainly worth a cursory examination, for it crosses the hilly tract by a much shorter route than mine, though the total length of line is increased, (b) is too circuitous for investigation unless some unforeseen difficulty is discovered at the Garm Af Kotal. unau to i,a8 Alter its debouchement on the Jhau glacis the align ment descends to the Nal River, R. L. 1,500, which will require about 800 feet of waterway in 40 feet or 60 feet spans. 1 There is a short stretch of partially cultivated alluvial plain on each side of the river, and fairly dense jungle of tamarisk and acacia. The banks of the river are of earth, about 30 feet high, and steep. There is a slight perennial flow in its bed. 01I did not find a satisfactory crossing for the bridge, but do not anticipate any trouble in getting good founds in red clay or sandstone, not far below the surface of the shingle. The catchment basin of the river, though long, is narrow, so its floods are not heavy, and 800 feet of waterway is more than ample. Prom the Nal somewhere near Kuragi, mile 360 , the line gradually ascends over a stony plain. The surrounding country for the next 25 miles most probably once formed a lake, into whose former bed various nullas have dug their present channels, leaving scarps and terraces of red clay and conglomerate to show its original level. Two of these scarps are crossed by the alignment, the first about 8 miles from the Nal River, and the second near the Monro. The latter is quite easy: the line would ascend along the face of the bluff in light cutting. The former is much loftier and more troublesome. The align ment there should not follow the Kuragi-TMa caravan road, along which the section was taken, but strike the Pan jgur-Damb-Bela road, 4 miles to the north, at the point where it tops the crest of the ridge. The bluff is 100 feet lower here, and the descent by either of the routes shown dotted on plan, is fairly straightforward, though the earthwork for 2 miles will he heavy. I made a section of this alternative, but it is not worth submitting; the correct align ment is so obvious. The rest of the alignment, as far as the Seetaro ascent (mile 385 , R. L. 1 , 400 ), is light line over dasht and glacis. Several fair-sized nullas have to be bridged—the Kang, Larendara, Monro, Ara, and Seetaro—but the spans will be short and the piers low. A few isolated ridges of Khojak shales can be avoided. The Seetaro ascent to the Jhau Lak plateau, though only 300 feet in height, is a more troublesome and expensive bit of development than the barometric sec tion would lead one to suppose. The lower portion is through a confused mass of clay cliffs and ravines, finishing up at the Kotal (R. L. 1 , 700 ) with a steep rise of 100 feet The best alignment will be found slightly to the right of the caravan road, where a basin among the hills gives room for development almost up to the top of the Kotal; the last J of a mile being on the face of the cliff and crossing to the left of the road. N.B .—Between Jhau and Las Bela, neither my surveyor’s nor my barometer agrees with the levels on the Trigonometrical Survey maps. Our barometers agree fairly inter se, and all agree as to the actual height of the Jhau Lak above the Bela plain. Daily dust-torms and atmospheric disturbances all the time we were here caused the discrepancy in reduced level (above the sea). At Monro and Seetaro our K. L. is 200 feet to &gt; high, 300 feet at the Goko plain,—mile 308,—and 400 feet at Las Bela. The next 17 miles across the plateau present no difficulties. The road winds in an open plain among high hills of soft sandstone and clay. There is a good deal of small span bridging and some earthwork, but the correct align ment is fairly obvious. The plain is occasionally earth and gravel, but more often of layers of sandstone on edge, such as may be frequently seen near Sibi. Lak-descent.—Tlae descent from the plateau, R. L. 1 , 700 , to the Bela plain, R. L. 700 , is the most difficult piece of the whole line. The caravan road descends the face of a cliff, known as the Jhau Kak, into a sort of crater of clay shale hills drained by a nulla running to the left under a sheer precipice. No adhesion railway could possibly follow this route. I had been told this beforehand, and so, while I was making the reconnaissance to Pasni, I sent my surveyor here to make a thorough examination of all possible routes. The alignment now proposed was only discovered after a series of failures, when heliad almost despaired of success. Subsequent detailed surveys will no doubt modify and improve it in many ways, but the general route shown on the plan via the Sir Kaur Kotal, and down the valley of that river, for at least a considerable part of its course, is, in my opinion, the only feasible route for the descent. Proceeding to derails, the barometric section leaves the caravan road at the junction of the Kumbh and Sir Kaur (west) nullas at mile 404 , about 4 £ miles from the top of the jh au Lak and f mile below the Kumbh camping ground (these details are intended to assist future survey parties). Thence it turns abruptly to the left up the Sir Kaur for three miles till the Sir Kaur Kotal is readied, where a | mile tunnel will be necessary through soft sandstone and clay. The permanent16 i line could reach the Kotal by a shorter route than the right-angled bend along which the section was taken. At the foot of the Kotal, at the point A on the section, is a small plain of sandstone on edge forming a cup among the mountains, and a certain amount of development can he done round the sides of this hollow. At its eastern extremity are the headwaters of the Sir Kaur (east). The section follows the nulla for five miles till further progress is stopped by a lake formed by slips from the ends of a high range of shale hills that crosses the nulla at right angles. Up to this point the alignment, though very expensive, has not been impossible, hut the sides of the lake and the slips beyond are quite impracticable. The alignment should, therefore, after following the nulla for 2J miles, trend to the right and tunnel through the clay ridge with a tunnel probably miles long. The rest of the descent is easy. The outer range of sandstone, which runs parallel to the clay shale ridge, and about J mile east of it, can be turned at the debouchement of the Sir Kaur into the plain. An alternative to this would be to tunnel through the clay ridge on the north side of the nulla, but the point is immaterial. 1—45 will be the best gradient that can be expected on this Ghat. 1—40 will be satisfactory. This bit of reconnaissance was the most trying work, as it had all to be done on foot, and the month was June. So precipitous and smooth is the clay ridge that it was impossible to get any measurement over it, its sides appeared quite unclimbable without some sort of paths; but from opposite ends of the lake a good idea of its width was obtainable, and I believe my estimate of miles of tunnel is liberal. The Trignometrical Survey maps, which, east of Seetaro, are on a scale of 2 miles = 1' and on the whole very accurate, support this conclusion. Unfortunately any one unacquainted with the country will hardly be able to distinguish this important clay ridge on the map, possibly owing to its top and sides being a multitude of little cones, and in showing the cones the fact that, in the aggregate they form a range, has been overlooked. It is also shown further from the outer range than is really the case. I need scarcely say that the detailed surveys from the Kotal downwards will be exceedingly difficult and arduous from the inaccessible nature of the hills. A raft or Berthon boat will be of great assistance on the lake, which is nearly ^ mile long but very narrow. None of us liked swimming it for fear of crocodiles (though there were no signs of them on the bank), and so we had to make a circuit of more than twenty miles to get to the opposite end, for the banks were too steep and friable to clamber along. [iV. B .—It will be observed that the large tracing on the scale of 4 miles= 1' only shows the hills bordering on the proposed alignment from the Sir Kaur to Karachi.^ The reason is that these few sheets are only published on a scale of 2 miles=l v , and to reduce them to the 4 miles=l' scale would have taken months. Printed sheets, on the 2 miles=l // scale, are, however, enclosed for reference.] &gt; The works on this Ghat will undoubtedly be very heavy. At the same time a little consideration will show that Bela is one of the most convenient places on the line for heavy works to be situated. The rails can reach the mouth of the tunnel from Karachi in a single year, bringing tunnelling plant, construc tion materials, and an ample supply of labour. While the tunnelling works are in progress, the formation can be completed up to Jhau, so that by the time the tunnel is complete there will be an uninterrupted stretch of line ready for the rails as far as the Nal Biver, while the Jhau-Kolwa Section should also be well in hand. It may be added that the clay shales and soft sandstone on the Ghat are very suitable materials for tunnelling through, and that, with the exception of the slips forming the bund of the lake, (where the cliffs were so sheer and high that slips were bound to occur), there were no genuine slips in the country; nothing but occasional falls from overhanging cliffs. Alignments from Bela to Karachi.—At the entrance of the Sir Kaur into the Bela plain, 126 miles from Karachi, all difficulties of construction cease. Thence, till we approach the low plateau forming the tail of the Habb Mountains, the line is over alluvial country, once, no doubt, an arm of the sea.17 Prom the Sir Kaur to the capital Las Bela, a distance of ten miles, the alignment traverses plain and glacis in nearly equal amounts. The only works are two short span bridges over wide but unimportant nullas. Las Bela, the Jam’s residence, is a small town of about 3,000 inhabitants, 116 miles from Karachi (R.L. 300, Trigonometrical Survey: 11. L. 700, by our barometer). A little garden irrigation is done from wells, hut all other cultivation is dependent upon the rain water brought down by nullas from the surrounding hills. The N.JB .—Wheat is said not to grow either here or in COUntry is populous and Well tilled to the Koiwa. Rust attacks it, perhaps due to the night extent that this water permits. The bunds dews, at any rate m i»eia. are admirably maintained, and the fields are clean. The crops are barley and Juari, and, in particular, a very valuable species of mustard which is grown entirely for export. The inhabitants are no longer idle Baluchis, but hardworking Jats. Their language is Sindhi. Where the land is uncultivated, a dense jungle of grass, tamarisk, acacia, and scrub covers the soil. The country is the paradise of the camel, which exists in great numbers. Cattle are also fairly numerous. There are many small villages and two small towns besides Las Bela.—Uthal, said to be larger than Las Bela, the centre of a considerable trade; and Sonmiani, a small port and fishing village on the coast. A brisk traffic is carried on with Karachi mainly by caravan, and a railway to Las Bela could be very cheaply constructed, and would probably pay working expenses. The alignment calls for very little description. From Las Bela the line should run to Uthal and not direct to Sonmiani. The first portion is over a cultivated plain where some irrigation openings will be required to pass the flood water from the hills on the east. Thence to near Uthal, where there is another large area of cultivation, the alignment runs along the foot of the glacis of the Pab range. Prom Uthal it should follow the caravan road, south of the Siranda lake, to within a mile or two of Sonmiani, where some sandhills intervene which should not be crossed. The port at Sonmiani is silting up, and a new one is being opened a few miles to the north-west. The country from the Sir Kaur to Sonmiani is so flat that I thought it unnecessary to make a barometric section. Prom Sonmiani for the first twenty miles, as far as Lak Bedok, the Karachi caravan road traverses a narrow strip of plain between a line of low sandy bluffs and the sea. At Lak Bedok it ascends to the high ground up the face of the cliff. A section of the road over this ascent and thence to Malir Station, North-Western Railway, is submitted for information. The railway should not attempt the Lak Bedok, but should make this climb of 150 feet to 200 feet with a gradual ascent, either via Adam Pir Ziarat, or Nakakhari, where there are easy openings in the bluffs (vide plan). Prom Lak Bedok the alignment should follow the caravan road more or less closely almost to Bawani. The country is a rolling, uneven, sandy plain, covered with scrub. Here and there are isolated rocky hills. Near Bawani the section turns to the right down a gently sloping nulla (instead of continuing along the road) with the object of obtaining an easier descent to the Habb River. Possibly this detour was quite unnecessary. At any rate, the direct route along the road might first be tried before adopting that shown on the plan. The Habb will require 1,000 feet of waterway in 40 feet or 60 feet spans. The banks are fairly low, and the bed of shingle with conglomerate showing in places. There was a little running water in the river when I crossed it, but I believe that is unusual, so the founds should not be troublesome. Prom the Habb I marched to Malir Station, North-Western Railway, via Magar Pir, so as to avoid entering the plague-infected area of Karachi and a subsequent ten days’ quarantine for all my party at Quetta. The country is similar to that traversed by the North-Western Railway between Malir and Karachi, and needs no description. It is sufficient to state that the works are light, and the grades easy. A ruling grade of 1—150 will probably be obtainable over the whole upland from Adam Pir Ziarat to the junction with the North-Western Railway outside Karachi.18 It will, of course, be understood that I do not suggest making the junction so far from Karachi as Malir. The actual position of a junction in such an important locality can only he settled after long preliminary investigation and discussion with the officers of the railway concerned; but for the purposes of a reconnaissance a mile or two one way or the other was of no consequence. it My surveyor made an alternative section of the Pabni Chauki route, but has no advantages over that now described. Water-supply. At ordinary times water is scarce over the greater part of the alignment. I travelled through the country after heavy rains when there was running water or pools in every fair-sized stream. It was, therefore, not always easy to ascertain where a perennial supply existed and where the pools were purely temporary. The various permanent springs and pools actually on the alignment are marked on the section. Others will no doubt be discovered during survey and construction, for the list cannot claim to be exhaustive. At the following places water is obtainable in considerable quantities (a) All round the Maskkhel Hamun, in shallow All round the excavations (6) Mashkhel River, in large pools near the bridge site ...

With a good water-supply at the former, arrangement B would do very well, though the runs are long. On the other hand, it would be a pity to cut out Panjgur, which is an admirable situation from its climate and surroundings for a railway colony, while Palantak and Mashkhel are quite the reverse. Traffic prospects. —As previously remarked, a railway to Las Bela would probably pay working expenses. It would certainly open up a large tract of country now without the advantage of railway communication. A small quantity of ghi, wool, and grain and a few passengers might be expected from the villages in J’hau. Kolwa has large possibilities. At present its produce is all consumed locally and in Kech and Panjgur; harvesters from the two latter places returning home with their wages in grain. From Panjgur an export of dates, ghi, and wool would arise, and an import of grain in exchange {vide preceding estimate of date crop). The same remark, but in a lesser degree, applies to Ladgasht. The bulk of the local traffic, however, would come in from the Kech valley over the light branch suggested. Under present conditions that cannot be estimated at more than four or five wagons daily, but with the stimulus of a railway a large increase might be confidently anticipated. Without this branch the distance from Turbat to Madak Kalat, 90 miles, is too great for the traffic to be tapped by camel carriage, more particularly as the ports of Pasni and Gwadur are much closer. With regard to the through traffic from Seistan, such traffic as was forthcoming would probably desert the Quetta route, and go straight to the port. Mineral resources. —I have neither seen nor heard of any mineral resources in Western Baluchistan. The geological formation is unfavourable, I think, but I have no knowledge of mineralogy. Curvature and gradients. —In the Ghat sections of the line curves of 600 feet or 700 feet would be necessary. The question of probable ruling gradients has already been fully discussed in the detailed description of the alignment. The probable grade at each Kotal is shown on the section. Materials for construction. —Beference has already been made to the possibility of adopting American steel trestles as a substitute for masonry piers, with a view to obviate the water difficulty which, in many places, will be acute. Bricks could be burnt with dust coal or firewood in Bela and Jhau.20 Some fair stone will be obtainable in many localities ; but the difficulty of obtaining stone masons in sufficient numbers will make that class of work impossible on a large scale, except at the Karachi end, where there should be no trouble in getting plenty of Cutchi masons. Concrete blocks and concrete will be found the best building material over the greater part of the line. Ballast is to be had everywhere. Sand or Bajri can generally be obtained by screening shingle. In tunnels where bricks are not at hand, I would suggest a skin of stone backed with concrete rammed in situ. Arrangements for survey and construction. —The survey would require seven parties, five of which would be engaged for two seasons —vide attached table. This is a large staff, but the country is so inaccessible that a lot of time would be lost in getting on to the ground. Table of disposal of survey staff.

One season ... 137 „ Construction would be put in hand from both ends, and rails would be laid as rapidly as possible to Bela and Palantak where the serious work begins. In advance of each railhead a section of 60 miles would always he under construction. Much more could not be attempted owing to difficulties of labour, supplies, and the carriage of cement. A single, isolated work such as the heading of a long tunnel might, of course, be put in hand regardless of its distance from the base of supplies at railhead, but there would be no advan tage in spreading operations over a wider area than that mentioned. Labour would only be dissipated and portions in advance completed, while those behind were hung up for want of coolies. Labour would come from Karachi, Afghanistan, and the Punjab. In order to attract it in sufficient numbers, rates should be fixed rather high, more especially as food-stuffs will be dear, having to be imported from a distance, and then carried from railhead on camels. Time taken in construction .—In two respects both the Kondi-Karachi and Kondi-Pasni lines compare unfavourably with the Nushki-Seistan: in carrying capacity, and in time taken in construction. With regard to the latter point, it is clear that the extension from Nushki can be put in hand and completed at the first threatening of danger; it is a card that can be laid on the table at any moment; but the construction of the link to the coast cannot be rushed. The combined Sind-Pishin and old Bolan railways took 8 years to reach Chaman. Another four years elapsed before the completion of the Mushkaf-Bolan chord. The total expenditure on the system, as it now stands, was 8 crores, the mileage 309 miles, and construction went on almost continuously for the whole period of 12 years. It would be sanguine, therefore, to expect that the project under notice could reach the stage of through communications in less than 8 years. It involves an expendi ture almost equal to that of the Quetta-Chaman system, its total length is much greater, and its aggregate mileage in mountainous and hilly country not much less, though there are no individual works on it of the same magnitude as the Chappar rift, the Khojak tunnel, and the Bolan Pass. The staff employed on survey and construction should receive more liberal treatment than the ordinary frontier allowances, to compensate them for the exceptional dreariness of their surroundings, their isolation from civilisation, and the enhanced cost of servants, provisions, &amp;c. Prom personal experience I can testify that the Sind-Pishin and Mushkaf-Bolan were quite pleasant places to serve in when compared with the country between Kondi and the coast.21 KONDI TO PASNI ROUTE. Details of Alignment. Gumbak to Turbat. . ^ t that between Kondi and Panisrur the Pasni route mmf for^both. Wlth that t0 Karachi ’ since the Palantak S°rge is an obligatory point At Panjgur the question naturally arises why should not the alignment to Pasni proceed m a south-westerly direction to Turbat, along the hypoteneuse of Chi^PollT /fif 10 ^ th i e tW n sides ’ and follow the carayan road via Chib, Boleida, and the Garuk nulla. My reasons for rejecting this route w ere i ■ ?'i rst &gt; ,V lat fording to the map, the Garuk nulla falls 1,700 feet between leida and Kech m a very few miles, so probably 1—25 gradients would be necessary in the descent. Second, the alignment would traverse mountainous country almost through- out, whereas the alignment, I propose, has a maximum of easy line down the Hech valley, with a minimum of ghat, and so is obviously the cheaper. . Il; ™ a 7 also be pointed out that the diagonal alignment would be largelv a series of zig-zags owing to the parallelism of the ridges, so its length would be 1 ttle less than that of the route adopted. So far as length is concerned, it is sketch) theSamethmS Whether We follow tbe ful1 line or the dotted (uide Third, some of the Ghat sections of the Boleida-Garuk undesirably close to the Persian frontier. Eourth, there were said to be a number of bad Kotals caravan road besides the Garuk. route would be on the Turbat Proceeding therefore on the assumption that Turbat should be an obliga tory point on a railway to Pasni, and consequently putting aside all thought of a direct line to the coast south-west from Oshaf, where there is a practicable looking Kotal east of Mount Janzar, there is little room for doubUhat the true geographical route is from a point somewhere near Gumbak, mile 219 on the Karachi alignment, down the Kil Kaur Tangi, or over one of the neighbour ing passes, and thence down the Kech valley. uci^uoour From Gumbak, K. L. 2,800, to Tang-i-Pusht, a distance of 20 miles the alignment for the first seven miles is diagonally across a series of narrow plains wmn e r il'T T' • 0 , ther 1 by tbe usual P araJlel chains of ridges. The works will be light, for the ridges have numerous low Kotals. ,. 7 tber V s a , short tunnel &gt; and a sudden drop into a nulla down which the line runs for three miles in a rugged, rather narrow valley bounded on both sides by hills. The works will be rather heavy, and a 1—O© 7 grade will be required. Ihe accompanying sketch gives a rough idea of the posftion22 At the 10th mile the line emerges upon an open plain, which it crosses to Tang-i-Pusht, at the head of the Kil Kaur Tangi. The only work of im portance is the bridge over the river, which in flood spreads over the surface of the plain, and has only a few ill-defined channels. An alternative to this alignment is to adhere to the Karachi route up to the 261 st mile, and then turn to the west down the Kil Kaur to Tang-i-Pusht. The length would he ten miles more, but the cost of construction would not be much greater, for the line should he a very light one, judging from the appear ance of the valley. The advantage of this alternative is that it avoids the tunnel and bridges in the little defile mentioned above, which will be very troublesome unless water can he found in the nulla bed. If water can be got handy, I see no necessity for the detour. On reaching Tang-i-Pusht I found that, owing to a record flood ten days before, the gorge was quite impassable, being a mass of pools and shingly quick sands, so instead of wasting time in possibly fruitless attempts to scramble down it, I left it for future examination by some cold weather survey party, and endeavoured to get an alignment by one of the passes in the neighbourhood. The unpromising appearance of the first few miles of the Tangi (subse quently confirmed by what I saw of the lower end) decided me on the point. The gorge is about 20 miles long, the hills on both sides rugged, and the amount of cross drainage unusually great. It is a matter of experience that routes down gorges in Baluchistan are invariably costly, e.g., the Chappar rift, the Mushkaf and Nari gorges, and the Kaisar gorge near Nushki, so, although the Kil Kaur Tangi will give a better gradient than either of the alignments I investigated, there is not the smallest prospect of its being any cheaper. The first route I tried was along a path leading from Tang-i-Pusht to Nag Kalat, and thence to the watershed between Kolwa and Kech. ., This obviously gave the minimum of descent down the mountains if a suitable Kotal could be discovered. There was a two-fold object in trying this alignment, as m case the Madak route, which had not then been examined, should prove impracticable, that via Nag Kalat would suit a railway either to Karachi or Pasni. J -d mentioned in treating of the Karachi alignment, the Tan^-i- will? h aat ' r °M te should certainly be surveyed as an alternative to the JYIadak ; but for a railway to Pasni the route over the Kathas? Pass is, in mv opinion the correct one, for reasons that will be explained in describing that alternative {vide plan). 5 , Jj * 16 Pf th al01 ?o 7 hit * the barometric section was taken follows the river I/Jh m f es ’ a ° d i, hea ascends sharply to the left up a steep side nulla.

This will explain the unwarrantably gloomy view I took of the possibility of getting a continuous workable grade for a single line over this short length. The descent from the summit, E. L. 2 , 600 , to Shenzi, E. L. 1 , 900 , is not very difficult on a ruling grade of 1 — 50 . The section follows the Molhar nulla for a couple of miles in fairly easy country where development is possible on both sides. Then, as the valley grew narrower and development no longer appeared possible, I turned to the east along the path to Nag Kalat for three miles, over a narrow glacis between hisrh, parallel ridges. As the path did not fall m the required direction, I turned south-west along another path leading diagonally to the plain on a tolerably easy gradient through a succession of narrow ridges. It will be seen from the section that four miles of this alignment are practically wasted as they are on the level. The correct alignment, instead of leaving the Molhar nulla, and making this four-mile detour, should follow its general direction to its debouchement on the Shenzi plain. The levels where I recrossed the Eod Khan path and the Molhar nulla {vide section) prove that the ruling grade would be obtainable by a much shorter route than that I followed. The alignment from the Shenzi (Kolwa) plain to Turbat. a distance of 70 miles, requires very little description. It should follow the southern bank of the Kil Kaur now called the Kech Eiver, rising and falling over the glacis between the mountains and the river. I he grades would be easy. The fall of the river is not more than 1— 200 , so 1—125 should easily be obtained by a surface line. For about eight miles near Eahgiwaran the valley is narrow, and the nullas from the hills have formed rather deep channels, so a good deal of minor bridging will be required. Elsewhere the works will be very lioffit; surface or nearly so. ‘ ° A peculiarity of this glacis is that it is conglomerate rather than shingle, so foundations will give no trouble. At Herokh a low chain of mounds lines the river as far as Sami. The alignment should be immediately in rear of it. Sami and Sharak, two fair-sized date groves on the opposite bank, mile 337 , are the first villages of Kech. Thence to Turbat the valley is wider and uninhabited, and the line is, if anything, rather easier. Kathag Fass alternative .—The alternative route over the Kathag Pass is, as has already been stated, the correct route to adopt for a railway to Pasni; for even, should the cost of the works equal those on the Tang-i-Pusht-Nag Kalat route, the difference in length between the two lines, a matter of 19 miles, should decide in favour of the shorter alignment. The section, it will be observed, is taken from Tang-i-Pusht to Sami-ud-din, but the railway would naturally follow the dotted line on the sketch straight from the mouth of the gorge already mentioned, at mile 10 from Gumbak.The mountain barrier overlooking Kech is apparently at its minimum of height and width at the Kathag Pass. The ascent to the Kotal from the north is short, and the height from the plain to the proposed tunnel mouth is only 300 feet. There will be some two miles of rather heavy earthwork among some foot hills on the approach. Through the summit at It. L. 2,600 or 2,650 a tunnel about } mile in length is suggested, so as to clear the main range and some spurs that abut on its southern slope. To shorten the length of the tunnel would entail prohi bitively heavy works on the south approach. Prom the mouth of the tunnel the line would develop at first among the foot hil'ls and afterwards over a broken glacis fissured with deep wide nullas. The glacis gets easier and the ground less broken as the descent is made. After about 4 miles of expensive development the line reaches easy country and descends to Rahgiwaran along the natural slope of the glacis. The ruling grade will be 1 — 50 . Tuo sections are plotted of the south approach of the pass, one runnin 0, in a ?,™th;east north-west direction, and the other in a north-east-south-west direction. I he first was hardly necessary, for it is obvious, ceteris paribus, that the natural direction of development would be up the valley rather than down it. At Eahgiwaran the Kil Kaur should be crossed, as it widens enormously lower down. Thenceforward the alignment to Turbat is the same as that already described. A good site for the bridge exists close to the camping ground where founds on hard conglomerate will most likely be got close to the surface. The banks are hard shingle and conglomerate 20 to 30 feet high, steep and well defined. The waterway would be about 800 feet in 60 feet spans. There is no surface flow in the river at Rahgiwaran, but there is at Oshaf three miles higher up. Prom the size of the pools in the bed of the river and from other circumstances I am inclined to think that the founds will require a lot of pumping lor a tail race of ordinary length would hardly reach the rock, and one would naturally expect a strong flow of water through the shingle. _, The river when in flood evidently carries an enormous volume of water. Its discharge in the recent floods cannot have been much less than the highest recorded of the ft an, which has a catchment area many times larger At* the road crossing below the Tangi, I noticed that the water had been nearly level with the banks there, 20 feet high and 800 feet apart. At Sami, where it is 1 a mue wide, immense damage was done to the cultivated fringe on its right bank and the river bed was strewn with date trees. ° 5 Turbat to P^m.-Prom Turbat two caravan roads lead to Pasni, one via P.idaik, an ^ ot her over the Gok Parosh Kotal, the scene of Maior Mavne’s victory over the Baluchis in the rising of 1897 . I investigated both routes and the latter is undoubtedly the right one. 68 Considering the general elevation of the range, the pass is a reraarkahlv whf w'l L - 900 ’ is onl y 350 feet above Turbat, 150 feet of which takes the form of a gentle rise over a glacis. A ruling for some Ihe fall on the south side to the plain is only about 170 feet, grade of 1 80 should be obtainable, but the w 7 orks will be heavy live miles among rough hills on both sides of the pass. At the foot of the Kotal we are 52 miles from Pasni and only 700 feet above sea level. Ihe road thence runs for six miles in a south-easterly direction over » stony plain intersected with a few shallow but well-defined nullas. It th™ turns to the south through a short Tangi, and for the next 10 miles the works will be average to_ heavy along the banks of the Samundari nulla The country is rugged with the usual chains of ridges. Near Biloo Bandaf, between miles 28 and 31 from Turbat, the last and worst of these is cleared : the road leaving the nulla and crossing a neck of ravines which form the tail of the ridge. 5 ravines25 From that point till the coast range is approached, the chief features of the country are the width and depth of the nulla beds that scar the interven ing plain, and the enormous extent of ravines fringing their banks. The caravan road follows the Samundari (Pidark) nulla which winds through a wide shingle basin,, hounded on both sides by ravines, and covered with tamarisk and Jhand, a sign that the channel is fairly permanent. An alignment along the outer edge of this basin, locally termed a “ Bet ”, would he quite feasible for a railway, and very cheap, hut for a few crossings of the stream. I think, however, that a safer line should be sought for on the right, where there is a nice, easy plain fairly free from ravines. The sketch may explain the features of the alignment along the “ Bet ”, At the 35 th mile from Turbat the road ascends the left hank of the river and traverses a plain sloping at 1 in 125 for 5 miles. This is followed by a short N.B .—Garnk is a common name for Kotalsand Stietcll among easy TaVineS ending Up bolder in ^ country ' 11 mean8 8tony or a crossing of the Garuk nulla and ery ‘ a descent on to the Gholamani Bet, a rudely tilled alluvial plain in the basin of the Shadi Kaur. The thirty-two miles of country between the foot of the Gok Parosh Kotal and Gholamani Bet offer excellent opportunities to the survey officers for selecting a better alignment than that now described. At the same time a railway along the caravan road would not be an expensive line to construct, the chief item would be major and minor bridging in short spans. Gholamani Bet, R. L. 150 , and 20 miles from Pasni is an obligatory point on the route, as the mountains begin to close in on either hand. Thence the line descends the valley of the Shadi Kaur, which, after receiving the drainage of the surround ing country in a number of good-sized streams, breaks through the range between Gholamani Bet and the coast. The alignment (which at the Bet itself should take the alternative dotted on the plan) follows the caravan road for, the first seven miles. There will be two crossings of the river requiring 500 ' of waterway each, and a mile of heavy work through some outlying ravines of the main range; but the greater part of the line is over an easy, open plain between the right bank of the river and the base of the hills. Eight miles from Gholamani Bet the river enters an alluvial plain about f mile wide, down which it meanders to the sea. Numerous spill channels show that it frequently changes its bed. The caravan road crosses it six times. The railway should bridge the Shadi Kaur on to the left bank at the head of this valley, and thenceforward leave the caravan road and adhere to that bank till it crosses the estuary of the river, three miles above Pasni. This will involve a slight detour and some heavy earthwork among the loot hills at the 10th mile from Gholamni Bet, where the river hugs some clay cliffs jutting from the main range ; but the resulting line will be secure from all vagaries of the river. Prom the foot of the Gok Parosh Kotal to Pasni a ruling grade of 1—100 to 1—125 should be obtainable. The critical point will most likely be met with in traversing the foot hills just mentioned. Curvature and gradients .—Six hundred or seven hundred feet radii will be necessary at Kotals like the Kathag and Gok Parosh and in difficult portions of the line generally. Otherwise, curvature will be easy. The probable ruling gradient at each Kotal is marked on the section, and has already been stated. °26 Kondi to Pasni. JVater-supply. —Between Gumbak, the junction with the Karachi align ment, and Pasni, the following places have a good water-supply : — (а) Mile 21 , from Gumhak, Tang-i-Pusht running water in Kil Kaur. (б) Mile 34 , Nag Kalat, running water in small nulla. (c) AIL along Kech (Kil Kaur) River from Kil Kaur Tangi, mile 491 , to Turbat, mile 111 , in pools here and there. N. B. —Prom Sami to Turbat pools are scarce. There is running water in the Kech River and a little cultivation at Oshaf, mile 57 ; Herokh, mile 76 ; Sami, mile 88. Sami Karez is on the wrong side of the river. A dried up Karez on the left bank of the river here might be re-opened. » (d) Turbat, mile 111 , Karez. (e) Gholamani Bet to Pasni,—mile 155 , to sea. In pools in the Shadi Kaur. A small supply is obtainable in the following places :— (a) Mile 0 at Gumbak. Pool in bed of stream. Mile 120 , Brinji. Springs in stream on both sides of Gok Parosh &gt; Pass. Mile 122 J, Gok Parosh. ) Doubtful if they are perrenial. Mile 125 , Balor Khan. Pool in nulla bed of same name. Mile 139 , Biloo Bandaf. Pool in Pidark or Samundari nulla. The quality of the water is everywhere good. On the whole, there will be no great difficulty in the matter of water-supply for the open line. The worst stages wall be Gholamani Bet to Turbat, 44 miles, with only 3 scanty pools between, and Raghiwaran to Gumbak over the Kathag, where there are only two small springs. Some water wall almost certainly be tapped in driving the Kathag tunnel. Kondi-Basni traffic prospects. —The traffic prospects of the Pasni line compare unfavourably with those of that to Karachi, quite apart from the situation of the port. Thus, while with the help of a branch 37 miles long to Tump, it would tap all the local traffic of the Kech valley, that cannot be considered equivalent to what may be expected from the Bela stations to Karachi, not to mention the minor district of Kolwa. Purther, it would naturally get less of any through traffic that was forthcoming from Seistan than the direct line to Karachi. Materials for construction. —Between Pasni and Turbat there is some well-bedded sandstone of a light blue colour, but rather soft. The prevailing stone is a soft, brown sandstone in the south, and a hard calcareous sandstone in the north, both of which might be used to a certain extent, subject to the remarks already made on the subject in my report on the Karachi route, (Materials for construction). Bricks might be burnt with dust coal in the valley of the bhadi Kaur. Pirewood would be insufficient for operations on a large scale. Ballast is abundant, sand is obtainable in places, but the sandhills of Pasni will be the main depot. In parts of the line it may have to be screened from shingle. Arrangements for survey and American steel trestles might be adopted to a great extent for reasons previously mentioned.

By following the caravan road, and avoiding works as far as possible, railhead should reach the south approach of the Gok Parosh Kotal in a year from the commencement of construction. The permanent works could be rapidly and economically built with the assistance of the temporary line. By the end of another year, or year and-a-half, railhead should be at the foot of the Kathag tunnel, with diversions at bridges and at uncompleted cuttings. Through communication would probably be complete in or G years from the start, on the presumption, of course, that work was earned on from both ends. For convenience of reference the estimates for both routes have been Estimates. kept together. The system on which they have been compiled is as follows:— The railway has been classified under six heads— Its. ( 1 ) Surface line, @ ... 50,000 per mile.

The foregoing classification has been arrived at by abstracting and analysing the cost under each head of work of portions of lines with which I am familiar, and for which detailed estimates are available. The alignment is then examined in detail, and each length is entered in its appropriate class. .

The light branch to Tump, 130 miles long, would cost another 80 lakhs, or a grand total of Rs. 7,48,00,000.

A comparison with the cost of the existing frontier system may serve to show what reliance can be placed on the above figures. Take, for instance, tire estimate of the Karachi-Kondi line, Rs. 6,68,00,000 for 567 miles of railway, of this 567 miles, 816 are surface and 87 more are easy line, so the estimated figures for them may be taken as correct. The cost of the balance, 164 miles, of ghat line, is the important subject for enquiry. As has already been stated, the cost of the Quetta Frontier System amounted to Rs. 7,90,00,000. The mileage is 309 miles, of which I reckon 175 as ghat and 134 as easy. The comparison is slightly complicated by a certain amount of both ghat and easy line being double tracked,. 41 miles and 22 miles, respectively; but a fair equivalent length of single line may be taken as 156 easy and 204 ghat. Assuming that the 156 miles of easy line cost 1J lakhs per mile, which is not far from the mark, for the works are on rather a lavish scale, and most of them were carried out under great pressure, the 204 miles of ghat line ergo cost Rs. 5,95,00,000, or nearly Rs. 3,00,000 per mile. It will be seen from the detailed statement of the Karachi-Kondi line that the 403 miles of surface and easy line are estimated to cost— Rs. 1 , 58 , 00 , 000 , 316 miles surface line. 78 , 30 , 000 , 87 „ easy surface line. 26 , 80 , 000 , special works. Share of contingencies Total 2 , 63 , 00,000 13 , 00,000 2 , 76 , 00,000 approximate. Deducting this from the total Rs. 6,68,00,000, a balance remains of Rs. 3,92,00,000, representing the estimated cost of 164 miles of ghat railway = Rs. 2,40,000, per mile, as compared with 3 lakhs per mile actuals as above for existing frontier system. Twenty thousand rupees of this is accounted for by difference in permanent way. The balance, Rs. 40,000 X 164 miles = Rs. 65,60,000, may be considered the outside limit of error in the foregoing estimate of the Karachi-Kondi milej or a little less than 10% of the total Rs. 6,58,00,000. Following a similar line of argument the limit of error of the Pasni line would be Rs. 50,80,000 (127 miles X 40,000), or 11^ of the total Rs. 4,84,00,000. For my part I believe that the figures in the estimate are already suffi ciently liberal. They have been prepared with considerable care, and with due regard to the difficulties of the situation. But the uncertainties of work on a Frontier Railway are great, and I know how liable one is to under-estimate them. An estimate of a large project is always liable to suspicion unless suppored by figures taken from actual experience. The preceding comparison is therefore useful, as demonstrating to any one familiar with the frontier system that the estimates under notice are very fairly reliable. In conclusion, I wish to make a few remarks on the subject of another proposed Frontier Railway. Its alignment is to run from Quetta via Kalat and Panjgur to Pasni. If my previous conclusions are correct, such a line has no merits as a scheme for Frontier Defence. It throws an additional strain on the carrying capacity of the Bolan-Hurnai system, and it goes to a bad port. Without a link from Panjgur to Kondi it offers no support to the Nushki- Seistan line. With it, it becomes the Kondi-Pasni Railway plus a branch, 300 miles long, to Quetta. A branch from Kolwa to Karachi instead would be infinitely better. W. A. Johns.Appendix. On reaching Quetta, as I wished to verify the figures for population and numbers of date trees given me in the course of conversation, by the Nazim of Kech apd the Naib of Panjgur, Major Showers kindly addressed the former on the subject. His reply, which I have only lately received, shows how difficult it is to obtain any reliable information from native officials. For convenience of reference I have arranged the figures as originally given to me and as recently furnished to Major Showers—in parallel columns in the subjoined statement:— Panjgur—Inhabitants Do.—Date trees Kech—Inhabitants Do.—Date trees • •• As stated to me.

The strategic value of a line from Nushki to the south-eastern elbow of the Helmand at Tandi Wall Muhammad Khan, whence it could bifurcate up stream to Girishk and Kandahar, and downstream to Persia, was frequently- urged hy the late General Sir James Browne, R.E. Little or nothing, however, was known of the last 80 miles of the route till in January 1903 a detachment of the Mission, including Mr. Ward, Executive Engineer, Punjab Canals, marched along it from Galur via Alungi Pat and Nawab Chah to Landi Wali Muhammad. The main body, with which I stayed, followed the line of march of the Boundary Commission of 1885, while a third party took an intermediate route, of which I was unable to obtain a continuous section. Thanks to Mr. Ward, who kindly took a section of his route, I have been able to submit sections of the eastern and western lines of march, while from information received from Mr. Tate, who followed the intermediate route, I am satisfied that the features of the country he traversed are practically the same as those of Mr. Ward’s section. It will be noted that the alignment now recommended for subsequent investigation (shown dotted on the plan) is in many places several miles away from any of the routes followed by members of the Mission, and that no section has been taken along it. I should, therefore, explain the circumstances under which the reconnaissance was carried out. The presence of a railway officer with the Seistan Arbitration Commission might have been objected to as having no connection with the arbitration proceedings. The prejudice of the Afghans against railways is well known; so, to avoid all cause of provocation, it was essential that my work should be done as unostentatiously as possible. To this end I was appointed geologist of the party, and spent my time ostensibly collecting specimens, while I placed my two surveyors at the disposal of Mr. Tate, who was carrying out a compass traverse of the lines of march. By this arrangement my men were able to make a section of the road, while Mr. Tate’s surveyors made the traverse. My own work was limited to seeino' as much of the country as possible along the line of march. So long as the caravan road along which we marched followed an align ment that was suitable for a railway, this procedure was quite satisfactory. When, however, the caravan road left the natural route for a railway, as it frequently did, (for its direction was entirely governed by the position of the various wells), or when we unexpectedly ran up against an almost impracti cable Kotal, as we did crossing the northern spur of the Chageh mountains, it was quite impossible for me to separate from the main body for a day or two, and examine alternative alignments; still more out of the question would it have been to pick out the correct alignment and take a section along it. To have done so would have attracted a most undesirable amount of attention. The reconnaissance was, therefore, limited to the examination of certain caravan roads from a Railway Engineer’s point of view. Fortunately the configuration of the country is of such a nature that I can speak with consider able confidence as to the possibilities of railway construction, and point out with fair exactness where the best alignment will most probably be found. Even this is of value, for if ever the time arrives when the construction of a line to the Helmand is called for, the knowledge of where the difficult portions occur will be of great assistance in organising a survey; while a record of unsuccessful attempts to find a route, such as mine at the Gazi Chah and Umbai Passes through the Chageh spur, may save days of fruitless exploration. With this explanation of the scope of the reconnaissance I may proceed to give a detailed description of the country along the route followed by the Mission.2 General description of Route—Its physical features for the first 80 miles from Nushki are easily understood. A narrow belt of low sandhills extends from Nushki to the south-eastern outliers of the Ohageh range. Among these sandhills are wide open depressions or “ nawars”, divided from each other by ridges of sand of an insignificant character. North of this belt of sand lies the valley of the Lora, a wide sparsely cultivated clay “ put”, which ends in a salt marsh or “ Hamun”, once a lake of considerable extent. This Hamun occupies the eastern flank of the Chageh mountains. North of the Lora are the rolling sands of the Registan that meet and swallow up the last rocky spurs, north of Umbai. Though these last sandhills appear extremely formidable, I am not certain that they are any worse than those encountered in parts of the Jodhpur-Bikanir Railway. There is, however, no necessity to enter them except at their south western extremity, north of IJmbai. While the general direction of a railway would lie east and west, the caravan road for the first two marches, Nushki to Lalla, takes a south-westerly course among the low sandhills first mentioned, its route being determined by the wells at Zangi nawar and Lalla. From the latter it runs W. N. W. to Zahro, where there are wells on the edge of the Registan, and thence to Kani, where the wells are among some low sandhills. These two marches are over hard clay “put” with wide patches of Shora. The Lora in flood spreads itself over a considerable portion of the plain, but its actual channels are hardly noticeable. So far, this route offers no difficulties to railway construction, but there is an objectionable amount of sand in the first 30 miles, and one sand Kotal 100 feet high, which, however, can be avoided. A better alignment will, I think, be found along the dotted line W. N. W. from Nushki, which follows one of the roads to Shorawak, and crosses the sand hills direct instead of obliquely. Thence, it descends the Lora valley to Zahro and Kani. Care should be taken to avoid striking the Lora too high up, where it runs in a deep channel. I rode over part of this route a year and-a- lialf ago, and got through the sand very easily. It is in the next 28 miles beyond Kani that the principal difficulties, in fact the only serious difficulties, between Nushki and the Helmand present them selves. The first is an abrupt Kotal some six miles from Kani with a long gentle slope on its western side. It can be entirely avoided by either of the routes shown dotted on the plan. The second is much more serious, and consists of a long fairly open gorge through the Chageh outliers at Umbai, terminating, in an abrupt rise of 300 feet, on to a plateau. •i Th u e as &gt; cen t the road is 600 feet in three miles, or 700 feet in five miles, but the difficulties are greater than these figures would ordinarily represent. J The mountains are volcanic, very rugged and broken, and a tunnel does not appear feasible, as there is a general rise in the country —vide sketch. TThe summit, however, could easily be reached by a 1—20 zi^-za^, if necessary, and beyond it there is absolutely no obstacle to a railway. Moreover, this outlying range tails out to nothing in a northerly direction among the sandhills of the Registan, and it is in that direction that the permanent alignment should be looked for. Before, therefore, any detailed surveys of the Umbai Pass should be attempted, an endeavour should be made to turn the mountains by the route shown on the plan. I am sorry that I cannot speak more definitely of this bit of the alignment, but my guide knew ot. no path through the sandhills by which I could follow the dotted line, and lejom the camp at Galur. It was all waterless sandhills, he said, and, as a tact, he knew nothing of the country. I examined the range for about 8 miles noith of our line of march, and, the further I went, the lower grew the moun tains, and the worse grew the sand. There was nothing formidable, however, in the sandhills from a Railway Engineer’s point of view, so far as the limits of my investigation took me, and the mountains appeared to tail out entirely. An alternative pass from Gazi Chah to Galur, along another caravan road south of Umbai, of which my surveyor took a section, was much more difficult than the Umbai route. Up to this point Zahro and Kani may be regarded as obligatory points within limits, but the only really obligatory point between Nushki and the Helmand is the spot selected for crossing this patch of sand and foothills. Erom Galur at the head of the pass we descended to the Helmand in three parties by as many lines of march as has alreadv been mentioned. I took the longest with the main body, as it seemed the‘least likely way to attract attention. Our road ascended gradually over open stony glacis and dasht for 55 miles to Mamu, along the northern flank of the Cbageh ran^e. ISeaiing Mamu were some wide and rather deep nulla-beds, elsewhere the country was easy. Thence we turned N. W. and descended to the Helmand for 74 miles on a general falling gradient of from 1—100 to 1 — 80 . With the exception of a few miles of low insignificant sandhills on each side of Jalal Khan’s Nawar, and the final ridge overlooking the Khadir of the Helmand, which will require a little contouring, the country is stony plain on which the rails could almost be laid direct. A railway, of course, would not take so unnecessarily circuitous a route as this (for the caravan road is compelled to follow a line of springs and wells at the foot of the mountains), and ascend 1,000 feet to Mamu, merely to descend again, but would keep much lower down on the glacis, probably to the south of Arbu hill. If our objective were Khwaja Ali, and not Landi Wali Muhammad Khan, a suitable alignment could thus be obtained, via Arbu and Jalal Khan’s Nawar. Mr. Ward’s road to Landi Wali Muhammad, after traversing a few miles of low hills below Galur, emerged on a stony dasht bounded on the right by the western fringe of the Registan. The level expanse of the plain was broken by steep ridges about 40 or 50 feet high, not unlike the banks of some ancient river or lake. Between the ridges the dasht dropped slightly to the Helmand, but the main fall occurred at these ridges. The total falf was, however, very much less than via Mamu, and only amounted to 1,400 feet in 80 miles. From Mr. Ward’s description of the country, and from Mr. Tate’s account of the intermediate route, I believe that the best alignment for a railway would be in the general direction shown dotted on the plan. It would probably avoid a rather abrupt rise of 250 feet in four miles, with a corresponding fall a little further on, which is the one objectionable feature in an alignment directly following Mi\ Ward’s route from Alungi Pat. I am told that it would follow what appears to be an old wide nulla-bed almost throughout. However that may be, it is quite clear that there is no serious difficulty in reaching the Helmand from Galur. Further, I am of opinion that, after taking all circum stances into consideration, strategic and commercial, Landi Wali Muhammad, at the great bend in the river from south to west, should be our objective, if ever a railway from Nushki to the Helmand be undertaken. It is the shortest route, gets to inhabited country first, traverses the minimum of desert and the maximum of cultivation (though that cultivation is only a tenth of what it might be), and offers facilities for an extension up the riyer bank to Girishk,'/ i i c 4 and thence to our future system at Kandahar. At, and above, Laudi Wali Muhammad the inhabitants are Pathans, and the country is, I am told, well tilled and productive. From Wali Muhammad downwards the railway would probably have to turn the southern flank of the Koh-i-Khan Nashin (with a wide detour to avoid steep gradients), as a line along the northern edge of the mountain overlooking the river would, according to Mr. Ward, be very costly, with deep cuttings and lofty viaducts. At a point near Deshu the line would again enter the Helmand valley. Thenceforth its course would be through a perfectly level Khadir; the only works would be a few bridges over irrigation channels, and the alignment calls for no further remark till we approach its northern bend near Bund-i- Kamal Khan. There, if our objective be Sabzawar and Herat, it may be desirable to cross the river (a comparatively simple job), and descend the right hand Khadir. Otherwise the line should remain on the left bank. There is, however, no longer any Khadir on that side beyond Bund-i-Kamal Khan, as the stream adheres to the southern bluffs, and the railway must ascend on to the highland, or dasht, which will entail a little earthwork and minor bridging for a few miles. Further on, near Dikdela, a slight detour will be necessary to avoid some bluffs on both sides of an old channel of the Helmand. I may add that after reaching Khwaja Ali, where we met our Afghan escort, I thought it better to discontinue the barometric section, as there were sowars at every one’s elbow, and it was no longer wanted. The valley of the Helmand from the Koh-i-Khan Nashin to Kala Fath, where it begins to expand into a delta before entering the Hamun or lake, may be briefly described as a narrow alluvial plain, about two miles wide, bounded on both sides by clay scarps and the desert. This line of bluffs varies from 300 feet in height, near Deshu, to 100 feet, near the delta. Its formation is either lacustrine or fluviatile, debris and silt brought down by the river, through which the present channel has been cut; I am inclined to believe the latter. The Khadir between the bluffs, though fertile, is but thinly populated by indolent Baluchis, and only partially cultivated by means of small irrigation channels leading from the river, which flows at a level some 15 feet below that of the tilled land. Its average fall is three feet per mile. The country is known as the Garmser, or hot country,—its general elevation is about 1,800 feet above the sea level. Huge mud ruins, said to be Persian, and remains of bricks, tiles, and pottery, testify to its ancient populousness and fertility. I estimate its present total production, in good seasons, at about 5,000 tens of wheat and barley, and an infinitesimal quantity of pulse and cotton. Trees cannot live owing to the frightful simoom that blows up the valley all through the hot months. Vegetables appear to be unknown, the inhabit- * Note. —Subsequently confirmed by Mr. Ward’s ^nts eating, instead, the raw blades of report on acreage under cultivation above Bund-i- yOUng wheat.* The fore^oin 0, estimate Seistan (vide Appendix). IS little better than a gUCSS, but I don’t think that it is much under the mark. It is based on a rough calculation of the area of the growing wheat crop. On the occasion of our visit, the country was suffering from a double famine; our Afghan escort following on a season of drought, when for the first time, in a period of seventy years the flow of the Helmand had entirely dried up. In normal seasons the bulk of the crop is available for export; some of it reaches Quetta and Nushki, or goes to Jalk and Panjgur in exchange for dates; the balance is bartered with the nomad tribes of the desert in, exchange for ghi, wool, and livestock. The surplus from a bumper crop is often valueless owing to the isolation of the country, but with improved means of communic ation a considerable impetus to cultivation would ensue—always within the limits, it should be remembered, of the culturable area, which cannot exceed 100 x 2, or 200 square miles, and is not probably half this; less in size, in fact, than an ordinary Indian Tahsil. At the terminus, however, is Seistan, and here we find an industrious population and a considerable extent of cultivation. ...5 Probably 25 , 000 * tons of grain = about 6 wagons per diem, would be available for export yearly; perhaps, under the stimulus of a railway, all the available land would be devoted to cotton grow ing. An excellent class of cotton is grown in Bokhara, and the Bussians are introducing its cultivation along the Trans-Caspian Railway. It is in this direction that the land and water of Seistan might be utilised to the fullest advantage. There is land in sufficiency, the soil is good, and the climate similar to that of Central Asia; while the normal discharge of the Helmand is not less than that of the Jkelum canal, say, 3,000 to 4,000 cubic feet per second. * -Vote.—This is rather an over-estimate (vide Mr. Ward’s letter in Appendix) under present conditions. Mr. Ward, from actual measurement, gives the area under crop in Persian Seistan as 5 &lt;',000 acres. 20,000 should be added to this for Afghan territory below Kala Path. Allowing for the two yearly crops, the total produce cannot at present exceed 35,000 tons per annum, a considerable quantity of which must be consumed locally. Commercially speaking, should the country ever become ours, a railway to the Helmand and Seistan might almost rank with our Punjab Canal Railways as a paying scheme. Under existing circumstances, it is fruitless to consider the subject in any other light than that of a possible strategic railway, and then, for reasons which will be subsequently stated, it is possibly a less effectual weapon than a Honking line along the trade route. That point I leave to the military authorities, merely adding that a further obvious consideration is that we can proceed with the latter scheme, which is in our own territory, and not with the former. It is not my province to discuss the comparative advantages and disadvan tages of going out across a desert to meet an enemy, instead of leaving him the enormous task of coming to attack us; nor am I in a position to speak of the opportunity that a rail head near Seistan affords for checkmating hostile designs on the Gulf; but there is one point on the route now described which deserves the attention of the military authorities. A reference to the map will show that, so far as a direct attack on Nushki from the direction of the Helmand is concerned, Galur must be a strategic position of first class importance. Situated as it is at the head of the Gazi Chah and Umbai Passes, with the almost impassable Registan on one hand, and on the other the equally impassable mass of the Chageh mountains, an invader must make it his objective, not merely for these reasons, but because of its abundant water- supply in the shallow wells of Safai, Galur, and Shah Ismail Ziarat. It will be seen that a practically surface line about 80 miles in length, entirely inside our own border, would land our forces within a day’s march of this spot, whence flying columns could stop all attempts to cross the desert from the Helmand (unless they were supported by a railway), by filling up the wells, and disputing every water hole with the enemy’s advance parties. For the desert could not be crossed even by a moderate force, in the face of any opposition, until detachments had held and cleared out all the water holes along the various caravan roads centering on Galur. If ever, therefore, we are caught with our frontier defences incomplete, and an attack threatening Nushki, it would seem that the construction of this 80 miles of light line might be put in hand with advantage, either direct from Nushki, or as a branch from the Nushki-Seistan Railway. Bridging .—Should it be desirable to cross the Helmand and proceed in the direction of Herat, several good sites will be obtainable between Bund Kamal Khan and Chahar Burjak. The river bottom there is coarse shingle and hard sand, almost amounting to soft sandstone; whereas lower down it is alluvial silt and sand. The length of the bridge would be about 1,200 feet. Probably 60 feet spans on wrought iron cylinders filled with concrete would be the most economical design; but open foundation might be possible. The low water depth of the river is in many places not more than 2 feet or 2 feet 6 inches, and the current, except in flood, is quite moderate. Sand-bag cofferdams or islands could very easily be made according to the style of foundations adopted.6 Note regarding floods. —See Appendix regarding flood of 18K5. Mr. Ward does not state the approxi mate rise of the river in feet, but it evidently was quite twice the height of normal high floods. The spring of 1885, more particularly early April, was extraordinarily wet ali over Afghanistan and Balu chistan. The maximum rise of the river did not appear to be as much as 10 feet Its banks were fairly stable, so training works would be light. For a temporary crossing it would be better to choose a site lower down, where piles could be driven. Curvature. —Easy, except in the section near Galur. Grades. — 1—150 to Kani. From Kani through the hills, 1 — 50 . The descent to the Helmand, 1 — 80 . Stations.—No remarks. Their sites will largely he governed by the localities of the wells along the alignment. Materials. —The country is destitute of building materials, except sand and ballast. The Chageh mountains are of volcanic formation, and the stone would be difficult to work. Good bricks could be burnt in the Helmand with imported coal dust, or, in small quantities, with brushwood, in the old-fashioned flame kilns used by the inhabitants some centuries ago. Water-supply. —It should be understood that there was more or less water at every camp on the march except for the last 50 miles across the desert. At some places it was obtained from ordinary wells of moderate depth, or from springs at the base of the hills; but the most abundant supply was generally got from shallow excavations, either in nulla-beds, or in depressions among the sandhills. The water was always more or less charged with salts, and unsuited for locomotives. It was scanty at Lalla and Gale Chah, but at Zahro, Kani, Galur, Nawab Chah, Salihan, and Mamu it was fairly abundant. Little difficulty, therefore, need be apprehended about obtaining a sufficient water-supply between Nushki and the Helmand. It will be quality, rather than the quantity, which will give trouble, though sometimes these saline waters neutralise each other. The Helmand water was sweet. I take the opportunity to mention that these wells and water holes are seldom in the open plain or “put”, but nearly always among sandhills; some times below a foot or two of coarse surface sandstone. I can give no explana tion of this curious phenomenon. It may be due to capillary attraction, or to the continuation of the clay “put” below the sandhills; but my observation is at variance with this latter reason, as, where sandhills occur, the substratum generally is sand. Attention to this may save a lot of unsuccessful attempts to obtain water during construction. Estimate .—For a broad gauge line between Nushki and Bund-i-Seistan via the Helmand— Rs.

Arrangements for survey and construction. —Two survey parties will be sufficient; one starting from Nushki and doing the first 60 miles to Kani; the second, a strong one, doing the difficult alignment at Umbai. When that has been approximately settled, a third party can be sent ahead between Alungi Pat and the Helmand. All parties should be well equipped with transport and pakhals. Plate-laying could commence from Nushki very soon after the first party had taken the field. The foregoing report has hardly touched on the extreme desolation of the country, a wilderness of clay, sand, stones, and mountains, practically un inhabited, except by the nomad tribes of the Registan. Local labour does not exist, but swarms of Pathans from Kandahar and coolies from the Punjab will flock to the construction of the line if peace conditions prevail. Even in time of war there should be no difficulty in obtaining all the labour required. W. A. Johns. i Foreign Office Fres*—No. 1163-25-9.03-60.Appendix to Report on Helmand line. Since my report was written, I have received a letter from Mr. Ward, Executive Engineer with the Seistan Arbitration Commission. It is so full of information regarding the crops and the country beyond Bund-i-Seistan that I propose giving extracts from it, which are printed below in the form of an Appendix to my report. W. A. J. “ After clearing an old channel of the Helmand near Dikdela, you rise on to the high dasht you saw opposite Khoga (Bund-i-Seistan). I have been along this dasht from Bund-i-Seistan to Kila-i-Nau; it is much cut up by big lakes, but you could get a fair to an easy run down to the cultivated plain of Kila-i-Nau. If you took your line to Nasratabad, you would probably , „ „. bridge the Rud-i-Seistan somewhere Ithink . between Burj-i-Sarband and Kila-i-.Nau, see plan. , or cross higher at Shahristan. The channel has in quite modern times carried the whole Helmand. In 1839 when Connolly passed through, he was told 9 years ago it was the Helmand. Eerrier found the main stream here in 1815. This year in high flood it carried 6,000 to 8,000 cusecs. Near Shahristan it fl iws in a narrow channel in the dasht. Perhaps you would bridge it at such a place ”. Oas/it- Ctxl.lt uctlect lain “ Anyway there seems scope for doing it cheaply, but your bridge must be big enough to pass the Helmand, should it choose to come back again. “ We gauged 70,000 cusecs in the Helmand this year, but the biggest flood known was in 1885, when at Kila Eath and Chahar Burjak the waters extended from dasht to dasht, and no tamarisk was visible above the flood waters. The Helmand has an enormous drainage area, about 60,000 square miles, nearly, if not quite, half that of the Indus atjAttock. “ I do not feel at home in discussing the question of how a railway should clear the Hamun. * * * I do not think it is necessary to goto Nasratahad, but it would suffice to cross the Hamun somewhere south of Koh-i-Khwaja. “ You would need an embankment several miles long, and flood openings, say ^ a mile at a guess, over there; arrived on the other side you have to get up a vertical cliff* about 50 feet high on to the dasht, which rises gradually to * Vide m&amp;p.

You could also run out a gradient to the Hamun level, but you would have some big cuts and banks. The Hamun isshallow. Horses walked the whole way behind the tutins. I suppose a Much better toroundthe Hamun if a line across it hanked CaUSC-Way about 20 UllleS long, of cannot be built in a season when the Hamun is dry. an average height of 6 OF 8 feet, with One . or two miles of flood openings arranged at suitable places, would effectually negotiate the Hamun. “ From Shahristan to the Hamun you might need several large bridges, hut by the road we rode to the city, there was only one which would need a span of 100 feet to 150 feet, and about half a dozen which could be negotiated with 20 spans. You could probably rely on getting a similar road running between tw T o big canals, and then you would only have to cross the distri butaries. “ If you went round the north of the Hamun, you would need to bridge the Helmand above Kila-i-Fath, to get a crossing in a valley, where the range through which the river could deviate is restricted, and then run outside the flood, limits of the present river to Chakansur and cross the Kash, then on to Jauain and cross the Farreh Hud, and then up the Harud valley to Khushk, I suppose. The bridges for these rivers would be of the same order as the Helmand bridge. They bring down a lot of w r ater occasionally, as they have large drainage areas in low hills near by. The Hamun is bounded by vertical cliffs all round, I believe in some places very high (200 feet ?). But we know little or nothing of the north edge. * * * * ** ^ e measured about 20,000 acres of wheat and barley from Koh-i-Khan Nashin to Bund-i-Seistan. / • i about the same in the Nad-i-Ali district of Afghanistan (right bank of Helmand; half of this was destroyed by flood). “ We measured about 20,000 acres between the two branches of the Helmand (Persian territory, } or J destroyed by flood). We estimate about 30,000 acres Seistan on left bank of Helmand. “ Tlle Kharif area is about f of the acreage of the Rabi area, half of which These remarks apply to Seistan proper.

The balance is juar (the greater soighum), maize, some cotton, til, tobacco, onions, some pulses. I may add that, if the present rulers encouraged agriculture, they could very easily grow from three to five times the present quantity of wheat and barley (they grow roughly equal quantities of wheat and barley). The stereotyped and universal reply to the question, why don’t you cultivate this land ? is, we have lots of land; there is no need to cultivate this ”,N( t' / From- No. 8500^ dated Quetta, the gth-i4th October 1901.

THE TRADE RETURNS OF THE QUETTA-SEISTAN TRADE ROUTE FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901. 1. As no Consular Report dealing with trade with Persia by the Nushki- Seistan trade route is available, the following notes, which have no pretensions to being a trade report, have been prepared in the hope that they may prove to be of some little use to merchants and others who are interested in this trade. 2. A reference to the trade returns which are annexed will shew that the value of the trade which passed through Nushki, last year, aggregated Rs. 15,34,452, as against Rs. 12,35,411 for the preceding twelve months, or, in * other words, that the advance in value which trade has made during the year under review was Rs. 2,99,041. Two years ago the value of the import and export trade through Nushki amounted collectively to Rs. 7,28,082; it will thus be perceived that trade by the Nushki-Seistan trade route has more than doubled in value in the space of the last two years—a result wdiich cannot but be considered satisfactory as evidence of the steady and progressive advance which the trade route is making. 3. During the past year much has been done to ameliorate the conditions under which trade with Southern Khorasan laboured. One of the most import ant concessions, granted by Government, is that by which money can be remit ted to either Seistan or Brrjand, or received from either of these places, through the medium of a Consular Treasury which has been opened in Seistan, and placed under the charge of the British Vice-Consul there. This concession is very popular and was taken full advantage of during the recent trading season. 4. Another concession which is calculated to exercise a marked influence in the development of the trade route is that which admits of rebates, to the extent of one-third of the actual carriage, being granted on the railway freight of certain goods exported from, and all goods imported into, India through Quetta and Nushki. In the case of imports this concession, at present, refers onlv to goods received at Quetta and despatched thence to Karachi or to North Western Railway stations in the Punjab and North-Western Provinces, or to stations on railway lines allied to the North Western Railway ; and in the case of exports to certain goods despatched either from Karachi or from certain speci fied stations in the Punjab and North-Western Provinces : but negotiatious are on foot and it is likely that the number of railway systems to which this conces sion applies will be shortly increased. 5. It used to be a common complaint among traders that there was no place available in Quetta where they could store their merchandise or live while they were engaged in selling their goods or in making their purchases, and they further complained that if they brought their goods into the bazar, the Quetta Municipal authorities forthwith mulcted them in dues which, although termed octroi, in reality were transit dues. These grievances were real ones, and were rectified, at the close of the past year, by the conversion of the Quetta District Police Thana into a musafirkhana, and by additions and enlarge ments to the building which are calculated to meet all the requirements of traders. The new caravanserai is situated in the immediate neighbourhood of the railway station and a special cart-road and platform, built by the Railway authorities, provide an easy means of access to it. As the building is outsice of Municipal limits, it is exceptionally well adapted for the purpose for which it has been set apart. 6. To meet yet another equally pressing requirement Khan Bahadur Mirza Mohamed Taki, an old and respected Government pensioner, has been entrusted with the charge of the caravanserai with duties to assist in every wav, travellers and merchants arriving in Quetta, to prevent them from being cheated by unscrupulous persons and to aid them in selling and purchasing2 i their goods to the best advantage. The selection of Khan Bahadur Mirza Mohamed Taki has proved both a happy and popular one, and has done much to advance the interests of the trade route. 7. Persian merchants coming to Quetta are frequently at a loss where to purchase goods or how they should set about doing so. To assist them a large room in the new caravanserai has been fitted up with shelves, and the various Indian Chambers cf Commerce have been requested to call on their members to supply specimen samples of their manufactures for exhibition. Each pattern will be labelled with its cost price per maund, hale, etc., the freight and inciden tal charges to Quetta, and any other information which can be compressed into a small space and is likely to prove of value to would-be purchasers. Arrange ments are also being made by which merchants will be able to purchase any article, which is on view, by depositing a sum of money in the local bank suffi cient to cover the amount of the order. It is hoped that the manufacturing community of India will come forward and give this movement their personal support. 8. A good opening awaits anyone who has the enterprise to open an Agency in Quetta to supply Persian traders w ith English and Indian piece and other goods, direct from the manufacturers in large quantities and at low prices; The rates current in the Quetta Bazaar for piece goods rule high, consequent on tne goods having passed through many hands and having paid many commissions, and as these prices offer no inducement to the larger traders to purchase in Quetta, the latter are consequently compelled to proceed in person to Shikarpur, Sukkur or Karachi, with the result that they are put to considerable personal incon venience, expense and delay. The Seistanis, who come to Quetta, are always impatient to return and chafe if subjected to any detention. An Agency con ducted on the lines noted should meet with immediate success, provided alwavs that judgment is exercised in the selection of merchandise and a sufficient stock of goods is kept on hand. 9. It is a common error to suppose that Persian trade is confined to a few cheap and, therefore, inferior articles. This is far from being the case. The Persian likes novelty and insists on having a thoroughly good article, and connecting, as he does, the word English w ith high quality and finish, his natural inclination is to purchase the manufactures of other countries only when he cannot satisfy his wish and buy English goods. It is largely by recognizino- this fact, which is known to so few, that the firm of Mohamed Alf and Brothers of Quetta and Seistan have built up their present business. 10. In 1899 the Government of India were pleased to sanction an allotment of Rs. 93,000, spread over a period of three years, for the improvement of the new trade route. This grant has admitted of much being done towards facilitating the transit of merchandise and the passage of travellers to the Persian frontier. I he following are a few of the more important improvements ’which have been introduced, noted in their order of importance. From Quetta to Nushki every stage is now marked bv a commodious levy post containing quarters for travellers and merchants, and at each of these stages supplies are forthcoming at favourable rates. ° Eight of the next ten stages west of Nushki have been provided, in addition to strong levy posts, with chapparkhanas, containing two large rooms with bath-rooms attached, cook-houses, servants’ quarters and adequate stabling. In these circumstances, and the first 273 miles of the caravan road being provided w ith excellent water at intervals of from 12 to 16 miles apart, it will be seen that the first halt of the journey to Seistan now presents no difficulty whatever, and that caravans can traverse this section of the trade route with an ease, comfort and safety, which wi 1 compare favourably with any other overland route in Northern India, Although only one chapparkhana has been completed on the frontier S wp 10r ^ ^ le roa ^ y e ^ four stages to the frontier also present very little n l v w ^. en c h a PParkhanas, which are under construction are finished, this section of the road will offer travellers as little trouble as the section of the road which has been described. The average distance apart of t ie six stages which intervene between the two sections of the road referred to. is Lo miles. I his is too much and as a reconnaissance of the surrounding countrv which was carried out last winter, has shown that a better, as well Ss shorter,’ alignment for a can should water be f( its length.

The coming winter will show whether this step can be taken, and if it can, then the last of the special difficulties which have had to be met in opening the trade route, will have been overcome. As regards the other improvements introduced, these can best be summa rised briefly as follows A kutcha road, varying in breadth from ten to twenty feet, has been run from Nushki to Killa Robat on the Persian frontier; in place of a weekly dak a bi-weekly dak has been inaugurated and the speed at which the dak travels has been accelerated from 132 to 100 hours; the value payable parcel system also has been extended to Seistan ; the number of wells at each stage has been augmented; and the fortified posts, which guard the road through out its length, have been much improved and strengthened. 11. The market which Persia offers for Indian indigo is an excellent one, and it is a matter of considerable surprise that the Indigo planters of India have neither turned their attention to it nor made any serious attempt to exploit it. Such a promising market should not be neglected. 12. Tea exported to Persia by the overland route realizes a larger profit when sold in the Mashad market than tea exported by the sea route and Bandar Abt&gt;as. While the delicate aroma of tea suffers w r hen exposed to warm sea air, no matter how carefully it may be packed, the matter is susceptible of yet another explanation, since it is evident that tea despatched direct from the gardens, or from Calcutta to Quetta and Seistan is not called on to pay many of the freight, commission, transhipment and incidental charges to which teas exported by Bandar Abbas are liable. A careful study of the question has con vinced the writer that it is only a matter of time for all the tea which is con sumed in Khorasan and Northern Afghanistan to be exported via the Nushki- Seistan trade route. Throughout Europe a large demand exists for overland, or as they are termed, caravan teas, all of which come from China. Much of the Indian tea is grown from imported China seed, and compares favourably in flavour and liquor with China teas. Now that an overland route connecting India with Europe is a fait accompli, no legitimate reason appeai-s to exist why teas grown in India and exported by the overland route, should not compete in Europe on favourable terms with China teas. Some of the Tea Asso ciations of India would do well to turn their attention to the matter and to despatch an experimental consignment of their teas to Moscow for sale in Russia. 13. The Indian and Dehra Bun Tea Associations have both despatched representatives to Khorasan with instructions to study the requirements of the Persian market on the spot, and to submit reports on the subject. Both Asso ciations are much to be commended on their enterprise which they have dis played in exploiting the new market which the caravan road has thrown open to them. 14. The firm of Mohamed Ali Brothers, which was established in Seistan last year and has done good business in Central and Southern Khorasan, has recently been followed to Seistan by the firms of Ram Singh Chaman Singh of Shikarpur and Mohamed Azim Khan and Brothers of Lahore. Judging from the numerous enquiries which are being received, there would appear to be every likelihood of the number of firms, trading to Seistan and Khorasan, being reinforced in the early future. The three firms just named can only touch the fringe of the trade there is in the country. It is therefore to be hoped that more Indian traders will turn their attention to the field which the Nushki- Seistan trade route has thrown open to their enterprise. 15. The number of Persian horses which reached Quetta in the course of the year under review amounted to 408 as against 40 for the preceding twelve months. The dealers, who brought the horses to Quetta, experienced no diffi culty in disposing of their animals, and the average price realized was so remunerative that it should go far to encourage the trade in future. 16. The past year lias seen a marked increase in the number of travellers who passed along the road. Many Shiah Muhammadans use the trade route to travel to Mashad on pilgrimage to the shrine of the Imam Raza; indeed the4 number of these Muhammadan pilgrims is increasing so steadily that Govern ment will shortly find it necessary to provide special pilgrim accommodation. at every stage, on the caravan road, between Quetta and Seistan. It is the dying wish of many devout Shiah Muhammadans that their remains be conveyed to Mashad for burial in the vicinity of the holy shrine; but Shiah Muhammadans using the trade route would do well to remember that passage of corpses to Persia through Baluchistan is not permitted by the Local Government. 17. There was a dearth of camel transport in Quetta towards the beginning of the year. To guard against this occurring in future arrangements have been made for a large number of Afghan camels being available at the opening of next trading season. It would be well if merchants using the road were to note that the average camel load is five maunds gross. Several of the trader’s, who came to Quetta in winter were ignorant of this and they also made the mistake of engaging their carriage themselves with the result that they were detained several weeks in Quetta re-arranging their loads and were put to much unnecessary expense. 18. The steady increase which the last two years have seen in the season devoted to trade is significant. Three years ago the trading season was limited to the five winter months. The trading season for the year 1900-1901 opened early in September, and had not closed nine months later, that is to say, for a period of no less than nine consecutive months caravans continued to pass to and fro along the road. A traveller, who went up to Seistan in June last, has left on record that the average daily temperature he experienced between Nushki and the Persian frontier did not exceed 91°F. What has been said effec tually disposes of the two objections which have been urged most persistently against the Nushki-Seistan trade route, viz., that the cold of winter and the heat of summer are respectively so great that they render the route impracticable during the greater portion of the year. 19. A recent inspection of the Nasratabad bazar showed that, excluding a Russian cloth known as Shikin Maghut, the textiles sold in Seistan are almost wholly of either English or Indian manufacture. Shikin Maghut is a kind of moleskin cloth which is manufactured in Russia in various qualities and shades and forms one of the more important Russian exports to Central Asia. That this cloth appeals to the native taste is undoubted, but it is difficult to say why this should be so, for the dyes used are bad, the material is second rate, and the prices asked are high. There is little doubt that if Indian manufactures were given a fair field, they could manufacture a similar article of higher quality and sell it at lower price in Trans-Caspia. Indian manufacturers might do well to turn their attention to the manufacture of this cloth, as it commands a ready sale on the frontier. The Political Assistant, Chagai, is prepared to supply batterns on application. 20. Messrs. Mclver Mackenzie &amp; Co., of Karachi, and Mr Duncan MacBean, of the Punjab Bank, Quetta, are prepared to act as forwarding agents for Indian and Persian firms. The Quetta Branch of the Punjab Bank°is in business communication with the Imperial Bank of Persia. 21. A Persian customs post will shortly be established at Hurmak on the Persian frontier. To save themselves trouble merchants are advised to provide themselves with the original invoices of their goods and to have each of their invoices attested, at the place from where their goods are despatched, by some duly qualified official. By taking this precaution merchants will find that their goods will be passed through the Persian customs with the minimum delay. The Persian customs officials decline to accept any but original invoices which should be clearly written in the English language. 22. British subjects can obtain passports on application to the Eirst Assist ant to the Honourable the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. A fee of one rupee is levied on each passport issued. Natives of India must support applications for passports by an indentity certificate bearing the countersigna ture of the Deputy Commissioner of their district. 2*3. On the 3rd April 1901, the Persian Government introduced a law abolishing all inland customs houses and transit dues, and substituting instead a rahdari tax of 6 annas per 240 lbs. This tax is payable on crossing the frontier and is levied in ; Persian Governmc vention. 24. Many en Europe via the ov of these enquiries travellers as have and expenses whi5 and is levied in addition to the 5 per cent, ad valorem duty to which the Persian Government is entitled under the existing International Customs Con vention. 24. Many enquiries are being received from people anxious to travel to Europe via the overland route through Nushki-Seistanand Persia. The number of these enquiries suggests that the route is likely to become popular among such travellers as have ample leisure and are not afraid to face the discomforts and expenses which are inseparable from a long overland journey.

With reference to paragraph 3 of the Diary for 31st October iqoi, the question of Customs refund raised in (a) has already been represented in my letter No 1569-C., dated the 22nd August 1901, and the question of the exten sion of the telegraph ( 3 ) in my letter No. 10930, dated the 13th December 1900. Copy of the Diary of Captain F. C. Webb Ware, I.S.C., Political Assistant, Chagai, for the week ending the 24th October 1901. 1. Mr. Foley of the Calcutta Tea Association arrived in Quetta on the 23rd instant. He travelled through from Meshed in the phenominal short time of six weeks. 2. I learn from Mr. Foley that the new well at Kundi, which is referred to in paragraph 1 of my Diary fcr week ending 8th October 1901, supplies very fair water. I his is good news, as the Kundi water was, without doubt, the worst to be found along the trade route. 3. With reference to Mr. Miller’s reported deputation to Kirman, the Thana- dar, Robat, writes that the Russian Agent avoided passing near Sarhad and the Persian-Baluch frontier. It would appear from the accounts sent me that Mr. Miller directed his march from near Girditalab to a point on the direct Hurmak- Neh-Birjand route, north of Palang Koh. The impression on the frontier is that Mr. Miller is either on his way to Meshed via Kirman, or that he is proceed ing to Bundar Abbas. 4. The Thanadar, Saindak, reports that the new post at Padaha on the Mir- jawah plain is finished and in occupation. 5. A Mashkel correspondent writes to report that the Domani recently raided a party of Jalk Baluch who were proceeding to Garmsel, and killed one of the party and carried off all their animals. 6. It is stated that Sardar Atta Muhammad, Sinjrani, of Garmsel, has received instructions from Kabul to take stringent measures to prevent the' fur ther export of grain from Garmsel, and that one Azim Khan has been deputed to make the necessary arrangements. 7. Messrs. Clementson and Marsh reached Dalbandin on the nth instant. I regret to say that the latter is suffering from a Sind-sore which he was so unfortunate as to contract in Quetta. 8. Five hundred rupees worth of property belonging to Messrs. Dhanjeebhoy and Sons, Rawal Pindi, was stolen from the Quetta caravanserai on the night of the 20th. The thieves were tracked along the Sariab road for a distanced 4 miles and the stolen property was found intact buried in a thicket. TheX thieves are still at large. As the Sistan caravanserai, Quetta, sometimes contains upwards of a lakh of rupees worth of property, I would submit the expediency ot increasing the strength of the Chowkidar establishment. 9. Reports show that the news of His Highness the Amir’s decease has been received quietly, not to say listlessly, in Shorawak. 10. I have recently had several conversations with Mr. McCausland on the subject of developing the trade with Sistan. The staple products of Sistan, in their crder of importance, are ghee and wool. What I am anxious for Mr! McLausland to do is to establish an apparatus in Sistan tor refining ghee and also machinery for pressing and cleaning wool. The Sistan ghee, which is brought down to Quetta in winter, is adulterated with fat and consequently fetches^ a comparatively speaking low price in the market. Sistan ghee itself is in considerable demand, so purchasers refine the ghee they buy from traders in Quetta and re-sell it at a handsome profit. Anyone, who has the enterprise to purchase ghee in Sistan and refine it up there, before despatching it to Quetta in hermetically sealed tins, should do very well. Sistanis dislike coming to Quetta, and provided they can obtain a moderately good price they will gladly dispose of their ghee on the spot. Again, the wool which comes to India reaches Quetta unwashed and full of dust and dirt. All this means a heavy loss in carriage which can be avoided by washing and pressing the wool m Sistan . The price of grain rules the price of labour. Sistan bein? a great wheat-growing country, cheap labour can always be obtained without difficulty. I have pointed all this out to Messrs. Parveez and McCausland and they are giving this matter their most serious consideration.

The Naib-Tahsildar, Chagai, writes from Dalbandin to sav that preven tive posts have been siattoned at Shah Ismail, jal.jil and the Shibian pass This news appears to accord with what 1 reported in paragraph 6 of my last week’s diary, iso far as 1 can learn the orders regarding these preventive posts were issued from Kabul prior to the decease of the late Amir.

He is a most intelligent man and prides himsel on being a great traveller and on having seen much of the world. He to!d me that he had come to see me in the interests of the trade route and he begged me to press for three concessions. These are— (a) A refund of the Customs duties paid on goods imported into India and re-exported to Persia via the Nushki-Sistan trade route. {b) A telegraph line to Sistan. (c) 1 “P^edj facihties for the carriage of goods between Quetta and 1 place the three concessions, Ghulam Muhammad Hussain asked for in the order of importance he assigned them. This merchant told me thaV he was leaving for Bombay in the course of a few days where he proposedto make purchases of China teas and English manufactured goods to the value of Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 30,000. He said that it was his wish to return to Meshed by the route he came, but he hinted that he might be compelled, perforce, to forward his China teas to Meshed via Bundar Abbas. Ghulam Muhammad Hussain’s requests coincide so closely with the requests made by every clear headed trader 1 have met, who is interested in the well being of the Nushki- Sistan trade route, that they are worthy of attentive consideration. I under stand that the question of the refund of Customs duties on goods re-exported to Persia, on which Ghulam Muhammad Hussain laid so much stress, has been referred to the Government of India for their consideration. I trust that the decision arrived at may be a favourable one. 4. Mr. Parveez paid me another visit a few' days ago. He said that if Government w’ould spend a small sum* on a road between Nushki and Quetta, he • Rs. 60,000 was the actual sum he specified. was prepared to inaugurate a bi-weekly system of freight cars driven by steam power. At first I was inclined to look on the scheme wuth diffidence, but since I have had time to consider the proposal in its various bearings, the decision, I have come to, is that not only is the scheme feasible, but that^ there are many points in its favour to recommend it. To refer to some:—There appears to be a general consensus of opinion that the improvement of the facilities for the carriage of goods between Quetta and Nushki is a matter wffiich admits of no delay whatever. Should the Government of India decide to build a railway to Nushki, the construction cannot be started fer six months to come and the railway itself cannot be opened to traffic for from eighteen months to two years from now. Money spent on improving the road would not only be wasted, but would be money well expended, for our experience in Northern India proves how essential it is to supplement railway communication by road communication. Again, should the Quetta-Nushki railway be extended west ward, it is unlikely that such an extension would be made for a long time to come; the freight cars would therefore be available, when the railway to Nushki is opened, to run from Nushki to Sistan which is Mr. Parveez’s intention and which, moreover, is quite feasible, as the local conditions are favourable throughout. Even should the arguments I adduce be ruled weak, and person ally 1 cannot see how exception can be taken to them, I would submit that a capitalist, who is willing to sink a large sum of money in an enterprise which has for its immediate objective the cheapening of the carriage of goods between Quetta, Nushki and Sistan—a matter on which the future development of the trade route directly hinges, should receive generous consideration and encourage ment from the Government of India. 3 C- Pie*s, Siml.a—No, 1135 F.

I reached Saindak on the 25th March to find a letter from Colonel Showers waiting me. Colonel Shov\ers wrote to say that Major Tighe was on his way to Ladis and that he expected to rejoin him there in the course of a few days.. Colonel Showers further informed me that Monsieur Cesari had returned to Seistan and that the Persian force was suffering so much for want of supplies that the Governor General had announced his intention of starting for Kirman without any further delay. This latter news was somewhat of a disappointment to me for two reasons : firstly, because I had hoped, as I had written to Colonel Showers, that the Governor General might have been induced to make an enquiry into the Cesari-Ido shooting incident ; and secondly, because I considered that if the Governor General visited Mirjawa, he would have been able to see for himself how grossly the reports which had been circulated in Tehran, as to our doings on the frontier, had been exaggerated. A doubt exists whether Monsieur Cesari will return to the Perso Baluch frontier, for I understand from Colonel Showers that the Governor General has forwarded a strongly worded protest regarding Monsieur Cesari to 1 ehran. W hile there is ground for supposing that Monsieur Cesari's return to Seistan is not wholly disconnected with his firing on Ido, a rumour is also current that he is wanted to answer for some very shady transac tions of which he has been guilty at Kuchan. Irrespective of whether Monsieur Cesari returns in person or not, we may rest assured that the Russians will direct a great deal of attention to this frontier in the immediate future. 3. I found on inspection that the Padaha post was built on the site I had reported it to be. i here is more cultivation at Mirjawa this year than I have ever yet known, the reason being due, so it was explained, to the security from attack afforded by our post, I joined Major Tighe’s camp at midday on the 30th ultimo to find all, officers and men alike, looking remarkably well despite the dis tance they had marched and the hardships they had undergone. Colonel Showers arrived on the 31st and the whole camp moved to Padaha the following morning. During the day we remained halted at Mirjawa; Colonel Showers and self took the opportunity of going over the country near Mirjawa and examining the dis puted frontier. To my mind the Holdich frontier agreement raises three questions. The first is whether the Mirjawa and Dar-i-Giaban are two separate rivers or are one and the same ? To this I would say that I have failed to adduce any evidence to show that they are not separate rivers and that Major Benn’s ex perience last year was the same. The second point is, assuming that the Mirjawa and Dar-i-Giaban rivers are one and the same river, is it possible to fix any point of junction between the two ? If the continuation of the Mirjawa river in the same line is the Talab river, it is very obvious that no defined point of junction exists.The third point is, assuming that the Mirjawa and Dar-i-Giaban rivers are separate rivers and the Mirjawa river is the one which passes the old fort at Mirjawa and flows into what is shown on the map to be the Talab river at right angles to the course of that river, is it possible to determine any point of junction between the Mirjawa and Talab rivers ? The answer to this is an emphatic no, for some little distance above the old tower the river splays out and spreading itself over a large expanse of country, it finds its way by innumerable Nullas into what is shown to be the Talab river, and as the Nullas are all shallow, badly defined and, if local information is to be relied on, are constantly changing their courses, it is impos sible to determine on any one as the main channel. I take the opportunity which offers here of making a correction in the map of Mirjawa which I submitted attach ed to my last year’s report. In this map the head waters of the Talab river are shown to begin a short distance below Mirjawa. This 1 find is incorrect, for it now appears that the Talab river takes its rise at Nodo, two marches below Mirjawa. While I much regret the error I made, yet I would venture to say that it was not altogether an unnatural one to make under the circumstances, for, firstly, I had no idea that the existing maps were as unreliable as now proves to be the case ; and secondly, since the continuation of the Mirjawa and Dar-i-Giaban rivers begins to skirt the foot of the Talab Koh a few miles out of Mirjawa, it was natural to fall into the error of supposing that the river which flowed at the base of these hills was the Talab river, an error which I would remark the Surveyor who surveyed the Mirjawa district fell into when he showed the Dar-i-Giaban river which flows along the base of the Mirjawa hills, as the Mirjawa river. The question which this error naturally gives rise to now is, what is the name of the main channel of the river from a point below the old tower of Mirjawa to Nodo, where the Talab river rises ? The answer to this question is that it is neither the Talab river nor the Mirjawa river, for between these two places the river is known under various local names. Under the circumstances which I have noted it will be seen that the problem of fitting in the Holdich Boundary agreement on the ground is now even more difficult than l made it out to be and that it is one which will puzzle the ability of the most skilled Topographer. 4. On the evening of the 1st instant ( received telegraphic orders instruct ing me to withdraw the Padaha post across the Talab river. Considering as f do that the future of the trade route depends in a large measure on our retain ing Padaha and that a foothold on the Mirjawa plain is tantamount to checkmate the schemes which the Russians cherish of running a railway to Seistan and continuing it thence to the Gulf, a view which, I was recently interested to see, is shared by the Russian Press, and that the retirement of our levy post would operate to undo much of the good which has resulted from Colonel Showers’ operations, t must confess that I received the orders to withdraw with a regret which was all the more pronounced as 1 could not help fearing that the order was due, in no small degree, to the false reports which the Russian Agent in Seistan had so sedulously disseminated in Meshed. It appeared to me that the astute Russian Agent in Seistan had succeeded just at the moment when he had anticipated defeat when his Agents had failed and were discredited beyond redemption. I have always felt that the importance of the strategical position which Mirjawa occupies on this frontier is not so fully recognised as it should be. I think that when Colonel Showers’ report comes to be read and the reports written by the several officers attached to his expedition come to be studied, it will be agreed that the Holdich Boundary alignment, so far as it relates to the frontier in the vicinity of Mirjawa, is one of the most serious errors which has been made in the latter history of India. My orders to withdraw were imperative. I accordingly withdrew my levies across what Colonel Holdich incorrectly assumed toVe the Talab river on the 3rd and knocked the post down the following day. I he point to which the post has now been withdrawn will be found by continuing the dotted line, shown in sheet No. 14-N. W. as bounding the southern extrern^ ity of the Padaha cultivation to the east across what is shown in the same map to be the Talab river. As to whether I will be able to maintain a post at the point 1 have withdrawn to, directly depends on my finding water, for following the establishment of a Persian Customs post at Mirjawa, which may be expected in3 the early future, measures will be concerted by Mr. Miller to deprive our post of water, fodder and supplies. I am engaged in sinking a well and I will report progress in the course of a few days time. 5. It having been decided that Major Tighe’s force should march to Mukak Karez and thence to Nushki, in three bodies, so as to minimize the difficulty regarding water, Colonel Showers and self proceeded on the morning of the 3rd to Saindak where we separated, Colonel Showers continuing to Mukak the fol lowing day and I remaining at Saindak where 1 propose to remain halted until 1 have ascertained whether it is or is not possible to maintain a post at the point to which I have withdrawn. 6. Prior to leaving Mukak, Colonel Showers very kindly sent me a letter which Monsieur Cesari had addressed to Mir Jhiand Khan and which had been handed to him by the latter. This letter which I deal with in extenso under a separate cover is interesting as it proves conclusively that three days prior to the receipt by Monsieur Cesari of the letter handed him by Naib Tahsildar Muham mad Anwar Jan at Ladis on the 21st of January last, in which, it will be remem bered, I warned him that the responsibility for any trouble which the employment ot force by him on this frontier might give rise to would rest on his shoulders, he had written to Mir Jhiand Khan for thirty men with the intention, it would appear, of resorting to violence. Monsieur Cesari's letter appears to me to justify not only the apprehensions 1 entertained at the time that Monsieur Cesari intended to provoke a conflict on the frontier, but also the course I adopted to prevent him doing so. 7. I have just concluded arrangements to accelerate the speed at which the dak runs between Nushki and Koh-i-Malik Siah from 8 to 5! days. The new arrangements w r hich come into force on the 1st May will, I trust, enable the 1 -ndian mails being delivered in Seistan 8^ days after their despatch from Quetta. 8. The Tahsildar, Nushki, who is ex-officio in charge of the registration of the trade passing through Nushki, writes that the tiade returns for the third week in March are disappointing. 9. Nearly all the caravan men whom I have met this year returning to Persia complain of the scarcity of the grazing along the road. This is naturally due to the severe drought from which the country is suffering. 10. Major Phillctt, H. B. M.’s Consul in Kirman, notes me that the Russian Consul General, Meshed, has for some little time past been in correspondence with the Parsee trading community of Kirman. ft appears that the Russian Consul General, Meshed, is endeavouring to induce the Kirman Parsees to visit Russia by holding out hopes that under Russian protection they will become even more prosperous than their Bombay brethren. So far Monsieur Ponafidine’s negotiations do not appear to have met with any marked success, tor Major Phillott adds, in his letter, that a Persian merchant named Mirza Ghulam Hussain has been appointed in Kirman as agent for the sale of Russian manu factures. 11. Messrs. Colville and Duke arrived here on the 8th. They tell me that so far they have found everything plain sailing and that they have had no trouble of any sort. 12. From two Garmsel Kat Khudas who recently visited Saindak I learn that the river Helmand is lower than had ever been known in the memory of the present generation. 13. Despite this fact I recently purchased 200 maunds of Garmsel wheat for 24J seers the rupee landed at Saindak. The somewhat curious anomaly exists here that the sale price of bhoosa (chopped straw) is actually higher than the purchase price of wheat and the purchase price of wheat is at present lower than the purchase price of barley. 14. Several caravans have recently passed through on the way back to Meshed. The last caravan consisted of 64J camel loads of Indigo, 5 loads of Harir (Native medicine) and 1 of snuff.'’-MP 15. Nothing further is known on this frontier regarding the movements of Muhammad Umar, Nausherwani. 16. The returns of trade through Nushki for the month of March total R. 5 . Ii 53,779, comprised as follows:— Maunds. Afghanistan export and import Local export and import Persian export and import 28,617 8,378 116,784 * After deducting Rs. 16.447 on account of 2,193 maunds of tea over-valued in the year’s returns to tbe extent of Rs. 16,000. months. Making the total for the past official year approximately Rs. 19,94,044*35 against Rs. 15,34,452 for the preceding twelve 17. The weather is cool and more like what I have been wont to expect in November.I ( Confidential.) Diary No. 19 of Major R, A. E. Benn, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice Consul, Seistan and Kain, for period 1st to 15th September 1901. r T * September I had a lengthy interview with Mon. Molitor, the Customs Officer, on sundry questions connected with the Customs regulations as applied to beistan. The details of this conversation have already been reported to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, in my letter No. 150, dated 4th September 1901, a copy of which was sent to the Government of India with my letter No. 168, dated 12th September 1901. 1 he necessity for this interview arose from the fact that Mon. Molitor wished to bring into immediate operation certain changes in the Customs rules which seeing that our traders had not been duly warned, would have affected them most detrimentally. Mon. Molitor also informed me that he had again received special orders to ^ n c- u u Ut delay tW0 Customs posts—one at Hormak, and one at Koh-i- Malik Siah . at the point where the Nushki route penetrates Persian territory.” As reported in the above quoted letter, I agreed to Mon. Molitor placing three sowars at Hormak for escort duty only, i.e., for the purpose of accompanying caravans from Hormak to the first stage towards Seistan and of preventino- them from usmg the direct route to Birjand via the Palang Koh. The latter, seeing that by the new Customs rules all caravans have to declare their goods in Nasra^ tabad must now be considered as closed. The three sowars for the Hormak post Tull be selected by me from among the Baluch sowars of Sardar Sayad Khan who supervises our postal service between Robat and Birjand. As regards the post at Koh-i-Malik Siah I was able to induce Mon. Molitor to postpone his visit Vl er( : t* 0 se ‘ ect a suitable site) pending the receipt of more definite orders from Meshed. j- In T^ U f course Mon ' Molitor intends establishing Customs posts at Mirjawa iv 1S u nu i! n( * ^ was ^. t ^ le Sarhad, and eventually at Bampur and Charbar Y\ e shall then have a chain of Customs posts along our border from Hormak to the Coast. As these posts according to Mon. Molitor—are to be furnished with escorts of Tehran cossacks and one or more European officials, I would again venture to urge the necessity for («) the extension of the telegraph line from Nushki to Robat, (£) a definite delimitation of our border south of Robat as far - J a ^» W t J^ e establishment of good Native or European Agents throughout the Sarhad, {a) the display of some force in the shape of a detachment of regular troops under a British Officer at Robat, if not permanently at least as a temporary measure. I would suggest that, if practicable, the Political Agent, Kalat, who 'l understand, is likely to be touring with a large escort in Mekran this cold’season should extend his tour to the Sarhad and return to Quetta vid Robat, staying at the latter place for some time. ' j &amp; As compared with our rivals we would seem to be insufficiently represented in Seistan, and when the new Customs scheme is carried through, the same will be the case in the Sarhad ; for—though the Customs is a neutral department— yet its employes are, after all, Persians and therefore easy prey for the Russian Consul, who will use them for the further extension of his political intrigues. Mr. Miller has a distinct advantage here in having his brother, the Doctor with him; the flatter is always available for district work and travels about a great deal, while when the Russian Consul is himself on tour the Doctor is now capable of carrying on hisjbrother’s work. Mon. Molitor has told me that it has been decided to send an Assistant Customs Officer here who is to leave Meshed some time this month. He tells me that the official selected is a Mon. Saiserie, a French Corsican, whom Mon. Molitor describes as “ tres fort” and who w'ould seem to be a man of asomewhat questionable reputation. He was removed by the Russian authorities from Ashkabad for espionage and has been guilty of other misconduct. He is a good Russian and Persian scholar. His appointment to Seistan coinciding as it does with the decision to establish frontier Customs posts along our border is significant and is, doubtless, not without encouragement from our rivals. When the new Customs scheme is put into execution this cold weather, Mr. Miller will use every endeavour to have more than a finger in +he direction of the arrangements. He has already hinted that he intends visiting the Sarhad him self. When therefore the time comes to select employes for the new Customs posts locally, we must be prepared to find an attempt made to put Russian Agents into them. To counteract this it will be necessary for us to be well represented at every point throughout the Sarhad, v’hile a display of force along the border on our part while these new arrangements are going on would go a very long way to checkmate any political schemes on the part of Mr. Miller. Mon. Molitor has received letters from the Director of Customs, Meshed, about his refusal to stay in the. British Consulate after having promised Colonel Trench that he would do so. Mon. Molitor came to call on me officially to offer me his apologies. It seems that he was made the victim of circumstances by Mr. Miller and his predecessor, Mon. Spineila, between them. Mon. Molitor has discovered that the Russian Consul is a man on whom but little reliance can be placed. He has confided to me that it was Mr. Miller who originated the cholera scare mentioned in my last diary. Mr. Miller took advantage of the fact that Mon Molitor neither speaks nor understands Persian to induce his Interpreter to make Mon. Molitor—wffien w’riting to the Quarantine Doctor about the sick ness among the Quetta pilgrims—represent that a contagious disease had broken out among the British subjects in the Customs caravanserai. Mon. Molitor is very bitter against the Russian Consul, and has referred to the unfortunate inci dent in a most apologetic w T ay on more than one occasion. He is now very friendly and seems anxious to help us in every way. I have already reported that Mon. Molitor had prohibited the exportation of all cereals from Seistan. 1 have now been able to arrange for a limited supply to be sent temporarily to the thanas on the road on payment of the Customs dues and pending formal permission, for which Colonel Trench is arranging, being received from Tehran. An order was issued by the Amir Hashmat-ul-MuIk prohibiting the export ation of ghi from Seistan. Mon. Molitor challenged the Amir’s right to issue such an order, as it was detrimental to the Persian Customs. He maintained that he as representing the Persian Customs was the only one who could prohibit the exportation of a commodity. The Amir, on the other hand, maintained that where the welfare of his subjects was concerned, Mon. Molitor could not inter fere. Ghi, he said, was not only very scarce this year but very dear owing to over exportation. It was the same in Kain and he had been ordered therefore to prevent it leaving the country. As the order affected our traders here, who had already advanced money to the extent of about Rs. 17,000 to local Baluchis during the summer, I went to see the Amir on the subject and pointed out the case of our traders. The Amir was willing to make an exception in their case, or rather he suggested that they should smuggle through the ghi in his name to Robat by a circuitous route with- out the knowledge of the Customs. He said that if the Customs knew orj what was worse, if Mr. Miller who had been threatening him on the subject, knew that ■ he had allowed the ghi to leave Seistan for Quetta, the news would * at once be sent to Meshed and he would be called to account. I told him that I could not lend myself to such a scheme as it was my wish to assist and not to defraud the Persian Customs Department. It is true that ghi is scarce and dear this year, but I am inclined to doubt whether th-e Amir has received any recent orders pro hibiting its exportation. Under the old Customs arrangements the exportation of ghi brought a considerable amount of money into the Amir’s pocket ; now he feels that under the present system this will all go into Mon. Molitor’s hands. 2 Mon. Mo all caravans ol regulations, ar godowns here, Meanwhile, he be ready to st; him in time to During m very many enc district.

Molitor has now ordered his men on the Seistan-Kain frontier to arrest all caravans of ghi leaving the district without passes as required by the Customs regulations, and he has asked me to ask our treaders to collect their ghi in his godowns here, whence they can take it to the frontier accompanied by his sowars. Meanwhile, he has written to Meshed for distinct orders and, as the ghi will not be ready to start for Quetta for a month or more, these orders will probably reach him in time to avert any serious collision with the Amir on the subject. During my recent visit to the frontier (i/iafe paragraph 2 below), I came across very many encampments of Baluch “ maldars,” who are the ghi producers of the district. I calculated that about 1,000 camel loads of this commodity were in preparation for export. But one and all told me that they could not afford the 5 per cent export tax now levied on themajid that they would try and smuggle their ghi through Afghan territory to Nushki. Some mentioned to me that the Amir of Kabul had promised them a free transit through his country. This information was afterwards confirmed by the Katkhuda of Kwaja Ahmad who said that it was intended by the Amir of Kabul as a blow at the Nushki route of which he was very jealous. I induced as many as I could not to risk the dangers of a journey through Afghan territory, but to come in and talk the matter over with me here. On my return I told Mon. Molitor what I had done and advised him to have a Customs post at Kwaja Ahmad where he is unrepresented. He was alarmed at this possible loss to the Customs and was grateful to me for my advice. 2. On the 9th September I left here on a short tour and returned on the 12th September. I visited Iskil and Kwaja Ahmad. At the latter place I inspected the Band-i-Seistan which has just undergone its annual repair. I found the bed of the Helmund river below the Band almost dry. The Katkhuda of Kwaja Ahmad told me that the Quarantine Doctor had been there on a visit and he remarked that the doctor was merely a spy and that the quarantine was only an excuse to furnish reports to the Persian Government about the Amir Hashmat- ul-Mulk and the British. I also heard the following Afghan news :— (a) The Amir of Kabul had been trying to induce Seistani villagers on the border to leave their land and settle in Chikansur. (b) The Akhunzada of Chikansur had received orders to erect boundary pillars along the Afghan-Seistan border during the cold weather. (c) The Governor of Farah had been imprisoned by the Amir of Kabul. The reason was not stated. (d) Four British Officers were said to be in Herat. 3. On my return to Nasratabad, Dr. Miller left for Kwaja Ahmad on tour. 4 The name the karez which the Russian Consul is said to be opening up near Duroh is Asparan and not Asp Barun as stated in former diaries. From further enquiries I have made its exact position would seem to be about midway between the two places marked Chashma Shutaran and Damdam on Lord Curzon’s Map of Persia to the south-east of Duroh. 5. The Sarhang and the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s Mustaufi have left Seistan for Meshed. 6. The Russian Consul, who is aware that sanction has now been accorded bv the Persian Government to the purchase of land by us, has been asking the Amir how much we intend to take and whether he will have to pay for the ground on which his Consulate is built. The Amir tells me that he replied that Mr. Miller would have to pay for his land if we did, and that we would take what is known here as Trenehabad. 7 A large Russian caravan of over 260 camels is expected here in a day or so. Mon. Molitor informs me that it is intended to make a great stir here on arrival. 8. Mahomad Azim, a local British merchant, has left here to open a shop in Birjand. His Agent remains here. 39 - The Amir informs me that the Gunner who assaulted my Chuprassi in the city sometime ago (vide my Diary No. 10) has been banished ^ UpraSS ‘ m,he ri,.,l 10 ' T h i e ‘P'P 34 ' 6 ? 18 ward &gt;n our new hospital is much appreciated here.

BENN, Major, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul, Seistan and Kain. 4 G. C. Press, Simla.—No. 943 F. D.— 15 - 10 - 1901 .— 31 .I From—The Hon’ble COLONEL C. E. Yate, C.S.I., C.M.G., Agent to the Gov- ernor-General in Baluchistan, To—H. S. Barnes, Esq., C.S., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of Captairf Webb Ware’s Annual Report for the year 1900*1901 on the development of the Quetta-Seistan caravan route. 2. In accordance with the orders of the Government of India conveyed in Foreign Department letter No. 53-F., dated the 8th January 1901, this report deals with subjects bearing on the development of the Persian trade and on the trade with the western provinces of Afghanistan. The report on the adminis tration of the Nushki, Chagai and Western Sinjerani districts has been embodied in the annual Administration Report of the Baluchistan Agency. Captain W 7 ebb Ware has also prepared some notes dealing with the trade returns for the past year. These notes and returns I have already submitted separately* with the • To Foreign Department, No. 8 S oo, dated the reC °mmendation that they should be print- O* — - El r\ O /-l r-y-* r-4 /-v _ X 1 • ed and made available for general circu lation in the same manner as the annual Consular Reports. 9th October 190I. 3. The progressive increase in the value of trade passing along the route has been satisfactorily maintained, and the figures show an increase of close on three lakhs over the returns of the preceding twelve months. The following are the figures of the value of the trade during the last four years :— Rs. 5)89,929 7,28 082 , 5 ^ 34 j^ 5 2 1897- 1898 ... 1898- 1899 ... 1899- 1900 ... 1900- 1901 The trade has, therefore, doubled in value in the course of the last two years. 4. The question of the provision of a caravansarai for Persian traders to which the Government of l nc ij a attached great met. by the conver- District Thana into a Seistan caravansarai. This building, which is situated near the railway station and outside municipal limits, has been considerably added to and enlarged, and in its present condition is sufficient for all existing requirements. This caravansarai has been placed under the charge of Khan Bahadur Mirza Muhammad Taki Khan, a pensioned Government servant, who has also been deputed to watch the general interests of merchants and traders. His assistance has been much appreciated and the selection has been a happy one. , 5. The concession of a rebate of one-third of the actual railway freight granted by the North-Western Railway on all goods imported into and exported from India by the Nushki route has been greatly appreciated by traders and should exercise a considerable influence on the development of the trade route. For this concession I am much indebted to Mr. Finney, the Manager of the North- Western Railway, who has shown the greatest interest in all questions connected with the pew route. Similar rebates have also been lately conceded by the Oudh and Rohilkhand and East Indian Railways. 6. The diminution of crime along the route reported by Captain Webb Ware is satisfactory, and the administration of the Chagai District in this respect is all that can be desired. The recent establishment of a Naib Tahsil in Chagai with head-quarters at Dalbandin will largely tend to the increase of our authority and every year will show an improvement in this respect.7. The post now travels through from Quetta to Seistan, a distance of 564 miles, in 15 days. From Quetta to Nushki there is a regular postal service which takes two days. From Nushki to Robat-i-Malik Siah the post is carried twice a week by the local levy sowars in 10 days, and from Robat to Nasratabad by the Sistan Consulate sowars in another three days. A through post line between Seistan and Mashad in connection with this Quetta Post has also been established by Colonel Tr?nch, the Consul-General at Mashhad, and we now have thus an alternative postal line to Mashad v hich takes comparatively little longer that the post by the Amir’s d&amp;k through Kan dahar and Herat. Should disturbances at any time break out in Afghanistan the Afghan dak would be closed to us, and it is therefore of every importance to us to secure an alternative postal line through Persia. 8. Mr. Vredenburg of the Geological Survey was deputed to examine the mineral resources of the Nushki District last cold weather. In the preceding winter Mr. Vredenburg found traces of iron, copper and lead at various places in the Chagai District, but he gave it as his opinion that the veins were small and poor, and that they would not pay to work. This last season Mr. Vredenburg devoted his time to an inspection of the Chapar hills, a small range near Dalbandin, and to the Raskoh, the main range dividing Kharan from Chagai. No minerals were found in the Chapar hills and none in paying quantities in the Raskoh. Traces of petroleum, however, were met with along the southern border of the Raskoh or Kharan hills. 9 To take Captain Webb Ware’s report seriatim, I may briefly note as follows :— 10. Paragraph 3. A list has been compiled of the frontier posts in Afghan territory. These at present only extend as far w'est as Kani to the north of the Chagai Hamun. As mentioned in paragraoh 51 of Captain Webb Ware’s report, many caravans cut across from either Amir Chah, Amalaf or Saindak to Seistan, following the direct road south of the Gaudi-i-Zarih, and when the Amir garrisons the western part of his Chagai frontier some of these caravans will certainly be caught. I noticed the danger of trouble on this account in 1895 when the frontier was under settlement, and Sir Mortimer Durand telegraphed from Tehran at the time, asking that in the case of any concession to the Amir at other places opportunity might be taken to acquire the triangular corner up to Koh-i-Malik Siah in exchange, and thus to prevent the Afghans getting astride the direct road up the banks of the Shelah. From Amir Chah by this direct road up the Shelah there is a saving of something like 70 miles, and consequently there wall always be the temptation ever present in the minds of caravan leaders to take the short cut to the south of the Gaud-i-Zarih instead of going round by Robat-i- Malik Siah, and it is impossible for us to prevent them. Should any opportunity arise of leasing this triangular corner from the Amir, I trust it may not be lost sight of. 11. Paragraph 5. I am arranging for the provision of a special Trade Moharir at Nushki. No. 8500, dated 9 th October . 9 o,. 1 ?' Paragraph 6 has been referred to in my letter forwarding the trade returns. 13. Paragraph 8. I am addressing Major Benn in Seistan on the subject, and I will find out what would be the effect of sending him a consignment of gold. 14. Paragraphs 11 and 12. The survey for a Quetta-Nushki Railway is now in progress, and the Government of India have decided to await the result of this Foreign Department No. 2466-?., dated 26th survey before considering further the pro- September 1901. . posed tramway scheme or the construction of a metalled road. Meanwhile during the coming winter I would suggest that the Silladar Camel Corps now being raised at Quetta be employed in the carriage of3 goods between Quetta and Nushki if not otherwise required for military purposes. All military requirements will be met by this arrangement, as the camels will never be more than five days’ march from Quetta ; they will be earning their hire, and they will be kept in exercise ready for service at any moment. 15. Paragraphs 13 to 38 show a continued improvement in the trade route, which is highly creditable to Captain Webb Ware, considering the small means at his command. 16. In paragraphs 30 and 33 Captain Webb Ware points out that the present alignment of the road is not wholly satisfactory, and makes certain sug gestions for improving it. The means at his disposal however have all been allotted, and he has no money to expend upon realignments. 1 trust he may be given a special grant of Rs. 5,000 (five thousand) for this purpose 17. Paragraph 39. The question of the allotment asked for by Captain Webb Ware to provide furniture for the travellers’ rooms in the various Chappar- khanas and to provide five of the posts with a small distilling apparatus will I hope receive the favourable consideration of the Government of India. The sum required amounts to Rs. 4,000 for furniture and Rs. 2,500 for distilling apparatus, and Captain Webb Ware asks for a special grant on this account as the funds at his disposal are not sufficient to meet the charge. I trust that this may be granted. 18. Paragraph 40. The strengthening of the posts on the caravan road is a subject that requires serious attention. Owing to the raid committed by the Damanis from Persian territory in April last, 1 had to sanction an immediate increase of 20 sowars to the Chagai Levy establishment, and the cost of these • Foreign Department letter No. I 48 4 -E. E., men Under the recent Orders* of the Gov- dated the 27 th August 1901. ernment of India has to be met from local revenues which can ill afford to bear the charge. I have now appliedt for the t Telegram No 37-C , da.ed Ihe O.S Oe.ober ^ treasury guard at Hitldubagh, 1901, to the Government of India in the Foreign furnished from the ZhOD Levy Corps, by Department. a m iljt ar y guard, and I am arranging to send the Zhob Levy Corps men thus relieved to strengthen the posts in Chagai and to take the place of some of the extra levy sowars. What further measures are necessary will be reported later. 19. Paragraph 42. I have asked the Survey of India Department to give Captain Webb Ware the loan of a measuring wheel. 20. Paragraph 43. The closing of the direct route to Birjand vid the Palang Koh by the customs officer in Seistan and the compelling of every caravan from Quetta to proceed to Nasratabad in Seistan is a matter, I think, that we have a right to complain of as an unnecessary hindrance to trade. The road into Seistan is very bad. Captain Webb Ware in paragraph 50 of his report describes the difficulty he experienced between Pusht-i-Dasht and Nasratabad, the last 21 miles of his march, through the inhabited portion of Seistan, where the road was intersected at intervals of every few yards by irrigation channels filled with water and so deep that his camels negotiated them with difficulty. The only camel Captain Webb Ware lost in the whole course of his tour was lost while crossing one of these irrigation cuts. During the last few years the area under inundation to the north and west of Seistan has been small and caravans have had no difficulty in getting out of Scistan. Once the inundations however cover all the land down past Koh-i- Khwajah and right away south to Kacholi the kafilas for Birjand will have even more difficulty in getting out of Seistan than they had in getting in, I notice in the last Seistan Diary that Major Benn has received orders to accompany the customs officer to No. 2 „, dated 3 oth September , S o., paragraph 3. R()bat ^ tQ he]p MoHtar to se]ect a suitable site close to Robat at a point where caravans proceeding from Robat to Kirman or Seistan can best be intercepted.4 We cannot object to the Persian Government locating a customs post close to Robat so long as it is in Persian territory, but if the Kirman kafilahs are to be cleared at this post, we can tairly claim that the Birjand kafilahs should be cleared as well so as to permit of their proceeding direct to Birjand via the Palang-Koh route. If these Birjand kafilahs are not cleared at Robat, then a fresh customs clearing Bureau should be established at Girdi talab where the Seistan and Palang Koh roads divide. To compel the Birjand kafilahs to go on to Seistan when the inundations are out would mean that they would have to go to Nasratabad and return back again to Girdi talab, an extra 100 miles all for nothing. 21. Paragraph 46. Here Captain Webb Ware gives a detailed account of his examination of Mirjawa and shows that the junction between the Talab and the Mirjawa rivers is not a defined point, but that the Dar-i-Giaban from the north flows into a sort of depression, known as Padaha, and that in years of heavy rainfall this depression overflows and the flood waters then join with the flood waters of the Mirjawa river from the west and find their way jointly to the south-east into the Talab. It is necesssry for us to have a post on this frontier to protect our trade route from the raids of the Persian Damanis and others, and Captain Webb Ware has located a post at Padaha for this purpose. 22. Paragraph 47. The question of the right of Sirdar Sir Nauroz Khan of Kharan to levy taxes on the Damani date groves in Mashkhel is one that requires further enquiry. The subject has been discussed with Sirdar Sir Nauroz Khan, who is at present in Quetta, and an agreement has been come to by which Sir Nauroz Khan acknowledges that he has no Sirdari rights over the trans-frontier Damanis, but while claiming Sirdari rights and a right to levy Poll tax from all Damanis who live within the limits of Mashkhel or pasture their flocks or own date trees in Mashkhel, the Sirdar has agreed to levy no taxes for the present from these Damanis pending a settlement with Mir Jhiand Khan, the Damani Chief, which Major Showers and Captain Webb Ware are to endeavour to effect during the coming cold weather. The question of the rights of Sirdar Sir Nauroz Khan over the Rekis under Mir Khia Khan of Mashkel is one that is now occupying my attention. Both men are in Quetta, and every endeavour is being made to effect a settle ment between them, 23. Paragraph 48. The question of an overland trade route to Kirman is one of considerable importance. It is a noticeable fact that Agha Muhammad’s kafilah marched from Kirman via Bam, Narmashir, Gurg and Robat-i-Malik Siah apparently following the road to the north of Sarhad which I recommended for the alignment of the new overland telegraph line and which Mr. Armstrong of Letter No. 10930 , dated 13th December 1900, to the Telegraph Department was deputed the Government of India, Foreign Department. t O Survey last winter. Agha Muhammad reported that he had found a very fair caravan route throughout with water at suitable distances apart and plenty of good camel grazing and fuel which is all in favour of this route for the telegraph line. I have not yet seen Mr. Armstrong’s report, but should the overland telegraph line eventually follow this route, doubtless a great impetus will be given to trade with Bam and Kir man. 24. Paragraph 60. I agree with what Captain Webb Ware says of the advisability of his taking a tour this cold weather along the Persian Baluchistan Frontier and of his visiting Khwash, the capital of Sarhad, should opportunity offer. In the event of Major Showers meeting the Persian officials on the Mekran Frontier, I propose to instruct Captain Webb Ware to meet Major Showers at Mashkhel to complete the settlement of the claims against the Damanis with the Persian authorities.25- Paragraph 61. The question of extending our telegraph to the Persian • Letter No. 86 gQ, dated 14th October 1901 , to Frontier with as little delay as possible theGovernment of India, Foreign Department. is one of great importance, and I have asked* that at any rate a postal telegraph line may be extended from Nushki to Dalbandin, a distance of 110 miles, during the present winter. 26. In paragraph 62 Captain Webb Ware recommends the grant of levy service to the amount of Rs. 250 (two hundred and fifty) per mensem to the Lamani Chief and his men who it appears own date groves on the British side of the Mashkhel Frontier. This policy has much to recommend it and I am m favour of enlisting some of these men in our service, but this can not be done till the Damani Chief has been called to account for the raid committed by his men last April, and the question must therefore be deferred till the result of the action to be taken by the Persian authorities is known. 27. Paragraph 63. The number of horses brought down by the trade route is very satisfactory. When at Mashad I reported how seriously the stock of horses had declined in Khorasan since the stoppage of Turkoman raids, but that the dealers do find horses and moreover make a profit on them is clear, and a supply is apparently springing up to meet the demand. The horses that came down were collected I believe from Daragez, Bujnurd, Bakharz and Merv. Had the present demand sprung up fifteen or twenty years ago, the , supply would have been much larger than it is now. 28. Paragraph 69. Captain Webb Ware has too many duties in his own district to permit of his taking the proposed tour in Northern India this year. The Manager of the North-Western Railway has, however, kindly come to our aid by offering to create the appointment of a trade Canvasser who will now perform the work Captain VY ebb Ware had proposed to undertake himself. A man with sufficient knowledge of the requirements of Persian Trade w r as not to be obtained in India, and I have therefore adddressed His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran asking if any duly qualified Englishman from the Imperial Bank of Persia would be willing to take the post and to travel down Mashad and Seistan, and impart the required information to Indian traders. I hope to receive a reply regarding this very shortly now. 29. In conclusion I have to bring to the notice of the Government of India the continued zeal and energy shown by Captain Webb Ware in the opening up of the trade route, and the care with which he is administering the district under his charge. 1 he area of the Nushki, Chagai and Western Sinjerani territory amounts to a total of 23,000 square miles and is every day becoming of more and more importance. The time has now come, I think, when this district may well be formally incorporated in the Baluchistan Agency territories and the officer in charge given the rank and status of a Political Agent. G.

I have received information that Sardar Imam Bakhsh Sarpara has left Kandahar with the intention of returning to Kardagap. 3. The Thanadar Dalbandin has effected the capture of the band of Samalani badmashes who have been hovering about the Chagai-Registan frontier for several months. The capture was a smart piece of work and deserves to be rewarded by a Khillat. The Thanadar reports that Fakir Taj Muhammad and rakar Khan rendered him great assistance. 4. I am frequently asked what is the distance from Quetta to Meshed by the Sistan-Nushki route. ~ 3 I make the distance 1,011 miles composed as follows :— Quetta to Nushki ... Nushki to Killa Robat, Koh-i*Malik Siah ... Killa Robat to ISasratabad-Sistan based on the measure* ments made in 1899 by Mr. Wood, Indo-European Tele graph Department Nasratabad to Birjand via Anjira and Sahalabad Birjand to Meshed, vide Meshed Consular report for the year 1896 - 97 , page 14 5 6 7 8 Miles. 9 « 372 99 * 198 277 Total ... 1 , 037 ! . A saving of 25 to 35 miles can be effected by turning off at Girdi Talab and avoiding Sistan in toto, thus making the total distance, say, 1,011 miles as compared to a distance of 966 miles the length of the Bandar Abbas-Kirman- Meshed road. In calculating the above I have taken the distance from Nas ratabad to Birjand by the Consular dak road via Anjira and Sahalabad road and not by the Nasratabad-Neh road which is some 16 miles the longer. 5. I am in receipt of information that the arrival of Muhammad Hussain’s caravan at Birjand has had an excellent effect. 6. The Political Agent, Southern Baluchistan, writing under date the 20th March 1901, advises me that Messrs. H. J. Rustomji &amp; Co. of Kaiachi are despatching a Kafila of indigo, cotton, woollen piece-goods, blankets, boots tea, safes and other commodities to Sistan in charge of an Agent, named Seth Muhammad Ali Noorbhoy. 7 . Captain Benn, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul in Sistan, informs me that an Armenian merchant is on his way to Sistan. 8. Desultory fighting has taken place in Sarhad between the Yar Muhammad- zai and Gamshadzai sub-sections of the Damani. The Yar Muhammadzai would appear to have got the best of the fight, for they succeeded in killing one of their adversaries. The state of Sarhad is a standing menace to the safety of the caravan route. G. C. Press, Simla.—No. 192 F. D.—9-5 931.-20.- ' / • . W...

From— Major G. F. Chenevix-Trench, Agent to the Governor-General at Meshed, To—H. S. Barnes, Esq., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am really in great distress here, and it is only with the hope of your support that I am buoyed up. If I could only convey to you something of the truth of this place, and if His Excellency could only look in, you would both he shocked, ashamed and angry. I have written several letters to you only to tear them up. They sound impossible ; they sound incriminating against my predecessors; yet, as I wait for cooler reflections, the miserable way this place has been run comes more home to me. You must know, and His Excellency must know, that you have had no results from here. If you could only look in, you would understand at a glance. % 'Without naming any predecessors, their chief object here has been to save money. I always except General MacLean, who did grand work here; since then it has been a gradual decay, until the British Consulate became a mere name. To attribute this to Hussian influence is wrong. Learn it is the fault of the Consuls themselves. In latter times it has been not only the fault of the Consuls but the fault of Government. How could they have Temple here without an Attache and without an Assistant ? Had Temple had charm of manner, had he had a knowledge of Persian and French, and had he taken the trouble to keep in touch with the people, still it would have been impos sible. I say with truth he had none of those qualifications. Put it down to the death of his wife or anything you like, but remember that during his time the Consulate sank so low as to he a quantile negligeable. He was in the hands of his office and led by the nose by the Russians, with whom he was on such terms of intimacy that he actually believed they did not work against us. The English community were disgusted. They were at loggerheads with Temple, and as a retaliation went out of their way to he nasty to the Russians. They lived in despair; they said, does the Government not know what is going on ? Are the English always to have their faces blackened ? Turn to the Indian British subject community. They have come weeping to me. Their interests were unserved, they never saw the inside of the Consulate, and they roundly abused Temple. If they tried to approach him, they were faced by the office. The office was headed by Ghulam Murtaza, a Kizilbash steeped in absolute laziness, debauched, and married to a Persian woman. Since I have been here he has never helped me. If a man comes with a petition, he always says to me—“ Oh ! that man is mad. He is not worth doing anything for. The Persians do not like our taking up such men’s cases, &amp;c.” His close ally is our Persian Mirza—whom to look at shows him to he untrustworthy as all Persian Mirzas are. Khuda Bakhsh, Allah Bakhsh’s brother, eats his soul out in the office wondering how long, how long. The office closed every day from 11 to 4 while all slept: Temple too. We were just existing among the Persians. Since I have been here I have interviewed some hundred Persians—some at night and some by day. Their story is always the same. Ghulam Murtaza and the Mirza are untrustworthy, and a scandal to the English name. One leading Afghan here said to me, “ in former times I could not see the British Consul; I couldn’t come through the office ”. I knew that the Persian Mirza, who is always in company with the Russian Attache, was quite untrustworthy; all the farashes were equally so; and Temple refused to see any one in the dark. This man is now in Russian pay, as he told me, simply because he saw the British cared not, and he had to live. He is the Russian’s chief informant about Herat. Such a thing as a private interview with a Persian official was unknown certainly in Temple’s time, and I believe in Yate’s time.2 r This is not a story of one man only, but of every one—even the English telegraphist who is loyal to enthusiasm. All this need not be. The Itussian dominance is detested, and the Persian willingly comes over to our side, but he demands attention and being treated not as a governed race but as a friend. It may not suit all Sahibs to sit and chat with Persians, but, unless the Consul does this, there is no British influence. This place is a small Legation : entertaining conversation; manners, dress play a large part. I have done my best since I came. I have brought Ahmad Din, my Native officer, and I have 10 sowars here. I have shown myself everywhere. I have argued and talked all day, and often till 12 o’clock at night, and I am amazed at the effect. All is not lost here by any means. Men are coming in to me every day. They say no Consul since MacLean has done anything. This sounds conceit and wrong for me to say, but don’t think it is. The Russians are most despondent. They have even tried to incite a mob against me, but the more they do the more I find the people coming over to me. Nothing else is talked about now, but my doings and Seistan. The Persians say the English who have slept for years have awakened. Really the tables are turning^ and the Russians knoio it. There is every sign of it. The Russian Consul-General told me that he was pitched into for want of energy, and that he had not got it after 4 years here. I have had one small struggle socially with the Russians. I invited the Dragoman to croquet and he never answered my letter. I wrote to the Russian Consul-General and protested, lie came over to see me and told me some lies very nervously. He then said that I had not called on his Dragoman. I said, “ I called on you, and your Dragoman was present; he lives in the same house with you. You and he together returned my call. If, however, it was not taken as a call, I am prepared to come and call ”. The Russian said if I did that all would be well. I said “ before I do that your Dragoman, Mons. Stroeff, must answer my letter ”. The Consul squirmed and said he couldn’t order that! I said in that case I can’t call and the matter will be referred, and we parted. The next day the young Dragoman thought better and answered my letter civilly and with an excuse for not having done so before. We have since called, and he dines here to-morrow, so that affair passed off. The Russians openly say they are afraid of my influence. One thing done here by my predecessors was to consistently snub the Afghan Agent here on the plea that Afghanistan can have no foreign relations. We even paid a spy in his office. Imagine the effect of this on° the Amir! I removed the spy at once and have exchanged visits with the Amir’s A^ent* who is most grateful, saying how pleased the Amir will be. I took care to explain that I could not recognise him as any more than a mere Agent, but that there was no reason we should not act together against a common enemy. The spy I sacked at once went and gave information to the Russians. The Amir’s Agent at my instigation dismissed him, so the Russians were sold.' I now have much secret information given me through the Agent’s men he has about. He was very bitter about the British Consulate. We are beginning a new policy in Persia, it is in exact accordance with the Viceroy’s book. It is having a most wonderful effect. Even the Governor here and the head Mujtahids are working for us now. I really hope we shall have Meshed like Seistan. The Persians are everywhere pleased. I have many signs of their friendliness. ^ To descend to something below politics, viz., the entertaining.

Every day I have Persians in who require to be entertained, while every Monday I have all the British subjects to a Darbar. Every A\ ednesday I have a garden party. I dined a party of 14 at the Russian Consulate. I think we had eight different wines, and their table was far and away better than what the Consulate’s would be with the few wretched consular electro-plate things. I have my own plate of course and can do them well, but the cost is heavy. I have dismissed one Ghulam, one 1 arashbashi, two farashes, and two more are to go. They are a set of worthless robbers. The wretched old crocks in the stable are useless. There they stand and eat and grow old, while the sowars slept and have Government syces to clean their horses. All these old crocks must be sold, and the escort here must bring its own horses. Temple kept neither servants (private) nor even a horse. There were no godowns for storing grain and bhusa ; consequently it was bought from hand to mouth, and the duffadar made his perquisite. Government were charged at the highest rates. Wood for the winter is an enormous item. There were no godowns for wood, and it was bought at the most expensive rate during the winter. Temple, Yate and Elias occupied two small rooms in the Consulate and shut the rest. Now we have 2 English merchants here wool buying; 4 Belgians from the Customs; Russian Consulate with married Secretary (at present temporarily away) and a Dragoman ; 2 Sahibs in the Bank, and Duke and his wife. Eoley, Penton and a German are on their way, and McCausland follows. They will all stay here, and I must entertain the community. Then the Persians have to be asked to dinner. They drink champagne. Now do you candidly think we are doing too much, and could any one knowing Erench and Persian, as I do, allow r the Russians to cut us out at every turn ? I ask you whether a large house like this does not want continual money to keep it going. The office must be rooted out. They are useless and belong to the dark ages. The horses must be sold, and officers here should be married and be obliged to spend the entertaining money. Yate was mostly in camp out shootin', Elias w r as always ill, and Temple asleep. Eorgive plain speaking. If I hadn’t my nephew to help, I couldn’t run the show. There is much to be done yet. I am busy building godowns, and buying what is necessary for the house. Only 3 out of G bed-rooms are decently furnished. The Seistan route makes all the difference to Meshed, and you shall have your money’s worth I promise you. 1 have been rather seedy from incessant w r ork and visits. Coote and I begin visits every morning at 8 a.m., 2 before breakfast. Nearly every night there is some one to dinner, and I haven’t be^un Persians yet. If I only had carte blanche to kick out the worthless characters in the office to whom I dare not give a paper, I would be happier. During the last week hardly a single day passed without 2 pages of cypher from the Minister, and you know the time it takes decyphering and cyphering. Anyhow with all the drawbacks to this place I mean to make a 'reat difference in our prestige here. Benn is keen, the Minister is keen, and so is Coote : and we mean to show w hat can be done in Persia. But do support the Hashmat-ul-Mulk—it is being treated as a test case by the Persians. To back him against the Persian Government is only nominal. The Persian Government know that it is Russia wdio is working against him * if we don’t help him, Persians will say we are afraid of the Russians. Pardon such an epistle, but there is much you should know, but I cannot go on any more. -Don't give up here. I have the Russians on the run and very discom fited. Let me have a chance. There is a great movement on here, and more will follow.

Chenevix-Trench, Consul, Seistan, for period from 1 st October to 15 th October 1900 . 1st October 1900 . —The Amir Hashmut-ul-Mulk sent his Mustophi to me asking whether I would be willing, in conjunction with the Russian Vice- Consul, to sign a certificate to the effect that grain sold in the open market of Seistan did not realize more than 15 krans a kharwar. This price was what the Amir was holding out for in paying the equivalent of his grain revenue instead of 17 1 krans a kharwar demanded from Meshed. The Mustopbi said the Amir had received a letter from Tehran requiring such a certificate signed by the Consuls from him, and in pressing for the certificate laid much stress on the friendship which existed between the Amir and myself. To have point- blank refused the request, would, I am sure, have hurt the Amir’s feelings, he cannot be expected to know w r hat is officially right and what wrong. To give such a certificate for a Persian would he very easy indeed. I pointed out to the Mustophi several reasons why I thought it would not be a very wise step for the Amir to take, and said I thought that if Colonel Temple spoke to the Wall at Meshed, and told him that I could assure him that 15 krans was a very high price for a kharwar of grain in Seistan, it would have more result than my signing a certificate. My arguments were evidently sufficient to convince the Amir that his plan would not be efficient, for I heard no more about the matter. The latest arrangement about the revenue is that the Wali will agree to the Amir’s terms and take a bond from him for the balance due. Anyhow 1 do not think there is any chance of the Amir being turned out of Seistan, which was threatened, and, as far as we are concerned, the revenue demand will make no difference to the Government of Seistan. In the evening I visited the Karguzar. As I have before stated, he will, I am sure, give no trouble here, he is very anxious to please and to make every thing go as smoothly as possible. 3 rd October. —Mr. Miller, in conversation, told me he had now bought the house he occupied from Muhammad Rahim, the former Russian news-writer here, for 450 tomans, or 1,500 rupees, and he had also spent about 1,100 rupees on the necessary additions to the house. As a Consulate the house is bad, situated in the middle of the town of Huseinabad, it is confined and hot. It has high walls round it which precludes any Seistani from paying casual visits to the Consul. It has, too, the disadvantage that it has no grounds, and cannot be extended. Though the total building has cost more than what I have built, in the Persians* eyes it is very mean, and compares unfavourably. My buildings are all detached and give the appearance of a village, situated on a fine, open piece of ground. I have a gateway at the entrance of my settlement, with a neatly aligned road of about $s00 yards leading to the flag staff and guard-house. The advantage of not being enclosed by walls is that everyone who has anything to sell brings it to my settlement without let or hindrance. Any man who wants to say anything can easily find an oppor tunity of meeting me. My well-ordered settlement with its mosque is a favourite resort of the Seistani. My weekly gymkhanas and now cricket are great attractions to the Persians. Very friendly relations have thus been established between all my party and the inhabitants of the place. Mr. Miller intends inviting the Amir and leading Persians in Seistan to a dinner on the event of the Czar’s birthday. He is already making preparations some three months ahead. The Persians here are not, to my mind, advanced enough to dine with Europeans, and I am glad the Russian Consul makes the experiment. Mr. Miller has altogether spent over Rs. 1,000 on wines, stores, furniture, etc., from India which he has ordered through Seth Suleiman. 4 th October .—Two Baluchis came to see me. One said he was taking a small caravan to Quetta, where he had often been before. He asked me for a letter of introduction to a Sahib in Quetta, in order to secure him against2 Quetta brokers who cheated the people who went there. I find that the giving of letters to everyone who goes to Quetta acts as a great encouragement, so I am always ready to do this for them. The trader is at first always shy about starting a new venture, a small advance of money to him or a letter seems to remove all fear from his mind. I have received frequent complaints from the Seistanis about the way they are cheated in Quetta by the brokers. They always beg for some Government broker whom they could trust, and who would he under supervision. I have already addressed a letter to the Govern ment of India on this point, and hope soon to be able to say a trustworthy man has been appointed. Even from Birjand I hear the same complaint against Quetta brokers. I have written to Quetta on the subject, and in my letters I give the merchants I always ask that they may be told what are the market rates for their produce. 5th October .—The two servants of the Customs who alone represent the Customs here came to see me, they argued that they had received their 5 per cent, dues on a caravan Seth Suleiman had received, calculated on the cost of the articles in India, whereas they said they should receive 5 per cent, on the selling value of the goods here. I said this was impossible, and refused to order Seth Suleiman to pay them any more than 5 per cent, on the Indian value. These Customs servants are quite unfit for the collection of customs in a place like Seistan, though stating that they are appointed under the new Belgian concession, they have no orders, and are unable to read and write even. Fortu nately matters in Persia can easily be arranged by a present, or money, and pending the establishment of a proper Custom house here, there is not much difficulty in carrying on work with them. I spoke to the Karguzar about the demands of the Customs men, he dismissed the subject in typically Persian method by saying—“ They have no orders and should be thankful for whatever they receive”. I heard that the Russian Consul received a letter from Sardar Jahan Khan, one of the Sardars mentioned in my note forwarded with my letter No. 108 of 20th August to the Government of India, I think it qufte pro bable that Mr. Miller is trying to obtain some influence over these Sardars I am on the other hand, quite sure he will not succeed, provided we are prepared to help the Sardars in some way. I decided to send three of my sowars back to Quetta for misconduct, a full report of their case has been sent to the Officer Commanding their regiment. My act may appear summary, but as their conduct was of sucli a nature that a possible outcome of it might be a shooting case in the lines, I considered I could not risk such an occurrence. The men were told by me that I did not approve of their conduct and that they would leave for Quetta within an hour or two. I had made previously every preparation and disarmed the three men with the exception of their swords. Such a thin' as a Pathan outbreak in my camp would bring great discredit on us. 6th October. —Mr. Miller’s Mirza left Seistan for Meshed. Mr. Miller said he had gone to fetch his family for whom a large house was in course of construction. Mr. Miller tells me he hears he will not return to him and has consequently stopped all work on the house which was being prepared! He also said he had been approached by tne Amir to sign the certificate about the price of grain here, which he had pointblank refused to do. 7 th October. —Mr. Miller issued a barat for 400 tomans on Meshed on presentation the barat was refused. Mr. Miller is trying to explain that the money will be paid, but the event has much discredited him, especially as 1 have issued a great many which have been paid at once. 9th October .—Sartip Mir Mausum Khan is pressing his father very hard to allow him to go to India, to see an oculist about his eyes. The Amir asked the Karguzar for his opinion; the latter, of course, said such thin^s should be referred to Tehran. The Sartip much resents that difficulties should be put in his way over this matter; he represents that while they are discussing his eyes are going from bad to worse, and that he sees no reason why he should sacrifice his eye-sight to political requirements. Later 1 hear that the Sartip represented that if he was not allowed to go to Calcutta, he would 'o to Tehran. He g would never al question to t\ bring a reply, have received with approval.

He gave Tehran as an alternative, knowing that at all costs his father would never allow him to go there. The Amir has now consented to refer the question to the T\ ali at Meshed, and a special messenger has been sent to bring a reply. By the time the matter is brought before me, 1 shall, no doubt, have received instructions from India whether the proposed visit would meet with approval. I his being the anniversary of the Shah’s birthday, I paid an official visit to the Amir llashmut-ul-Mulk. I found him decorated with a large diamond order and wearing diamond ornaments on his Kashmir coat of ceremony. There is a very large trade to be carried on here in the export of wool, Seth Suleiman is buying all he can atl'ord and calculates making a profit of Rs. 10 a maund in Quetta. Messrs. Ralli Brothers have, he reports, made an olfer to his brother to buy all the wool that can be brought to Quetta. Several Seistani merchants are interested in this wool trade, but they are inclined to send their wool to Sabzawar, where the Armenians buy it for the Russian markets. They will eventually all follow Seth Suleiman, but I regret extremely I have not other Indian merchants here who could give a lead, for that is really all the trade now wants here. ^ 10 th October. Some time ago I wrote to the Chamber of Commerce at Cawnpur urging them to send a trial caravan of leather-made goods to Persia. I received an answer from them saying that they hoped I would induce the Persian merchant to come to them to buy, as the Afghan merchant did. I have written again to them pointing out the different relations which have up to this existed between Persia and India, and Afghanistan and India, and have asked them to reconsider their resolution. I hear they will not show the enterprise to send a trial caravan to Persia, so I am doing all I can to induce Persians to go to them. Received a petition from the Birjand merchants praying for some con cessions by the new route and urging the importance of establishing a bank at Birjand and of appointing a trustworthy broker at Quetta. Their petition has been forwarded to the Government for consideration. Any assurance from Government that the road is safe, that brokers are established, or that a small concession has been given, will, I believe, bring the entire trade of Birjand some 4,000 camels annually by the Seistan-Quetta route. The Oriental merchant craves always for some recognition by Government, it seems to give them just that impetus to start which they lack in themselves. I expect a very large increase in the number of camels which will this year pass by the Seistan route. I estimate that about 4,000 camels will make the double journey this year. I am anxious that Quetta should be prepared for their reception, for there will be many trial caravans whose fortunes will influence the trade considerably. Octroi duties and dishonest brokers are wdiat they fear most. The traders who used to come to Leh complained against railway over charges and extortion ; this, I hope, will be supervised at Quetta. Bad accom modation in Quetta will also be thought a grievance. The one cry of all traders is for a railway. 11 th October .—Mulla Muhammad Husain, a Mulla who devotes more attention to making money than he does to his religious duty, came to pay me a visit, he asked for a barat on Quetta for Rs. 1,000, which I gave him in exchange for krans at the current rate of exchange. He has before been to Quetta and has penetrated as far as Sukkur. I promised to give him his rail way fare from Quetta to Cawnpur, a concession the Cawnpur Chamber of Commerce said they were always prepared to give. I am giving him a letter to the Agent to Governor-General, Quetta, asking him that he may be given a ticket to Karachi and back. Small concessions such as these are thought a great deal of, and I consider it (well that the Persian should be encouraged to penetrate far into India to improve his knowledge of English ways and to help him to learn the trade of India. I am helping a very intelligent man of the trading class from Meshed to go to Quetta, and am asking that he be sent to some of the chief centres of trade in India. 12 th October .—Seth Suleiman took possession of his newly-built shop and gave tea, etc., to all the leading Mullas, etc., in Seistan.4 13 th October. —Mr. Miller said he had received a letter from a friend in Bokhara asking whether there was any chance of the British Consul allowing him to travel to India by the Seistan route. ]\lr. Miller, in his question on this point, anticipated a refusal, so I did not encourage the idea and merely said that if any Russian officer wished to travel to India by this route he must arrange it with his own Government. Mr. Miller said that he did not want to do that, so I said in that case there was no chance of his travelling by this route. &lt; ° / 14 th October .—Two men came with sixty camels from Herat having travelled by JFarah. They said the Amir has issued orders that no product of Herat was to go to Russia, but that it was to go to India either through Kandahar or by the Seistau route, the Bunder Abbas route, not being recom mended. The two Afghans said that four hundred more camels were coming from Herat after them, and that many more would come, that this route would be more popular than through Kandahar, where heavy duties were demanded. I gave them letters to officers in Quetta, and they were each given a lungi for the honour of being the first to travel from Herat, during my time, to Quetta. loth October .—Received a visit from the Amir. He was, as usual, very friendly and told me a great deal about sport in Seistan. As I cannot hire mules here for transport when I move he very kindlv offered to place as many of his mules as I liked at my disposal any time i went into camp. This is a great convenience to me and is a mark of his friendly feelings towards me. General Remarks. There is a very marked change in the demeanour of all the people of Seistan towards the British Consulate from what it was when I came. I am less watched and less talked about. Everyone has accepted the fact of a British Consulate being here. Men who formerly only dared to visit me by night from fear of being thought too friendly with us now come on business openly. I also notice that any secret informants I have have now nothin&lt;&gt;‘ to report when they come. All this, I think, is very satisfactory and leaves us free now to develop trade with all the ingenuity possible and so secure as rapidly as we can the benefits which are open to us by the closer connection India has with Persia through the Seistan-Nushki route. Persians of any intelligence with whom I talk fully comprehend not only the commercial importance of this route wffiich they place very high, but also the political value to Persia there is in having the English and India within easy communication. I hope it may not be long before the telegraph line now at Nushki be extended to Kela Rabat as I have before remarked, no ground could, in my mind, be more suited for telegraph poles than that between Nushki and Rabat. From Birjand I receive satisfactory reports of progress, and hear that the Seistan route is occupying the attention of all traders who even go so far as to say that the Bunder Abbas route, as far as they are concerned, is doomed. G. CHENEVIX-TRENCH, Major, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul Jor Seistan. Exd.—B. M. 0.1. C. P. 0.— No. 3x5 P. D.—23-1M90Q—31.1 Diary Mo. 8 of Major R. A. E. Benn, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul tor Seistan for period ending 1st to 15th May 1901. The past fortnight has been worked by a decided attempt on the part of ^ the Russian Vice-Consul to carry through a scheme which had for its triple object the interruption of our friendly relations with the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, the destruction of our prestige and as a sequel to the above the downfall of the Amir himself. Mr. Miller had taken the advantage of my absence on tour to work upon the Amir to put obstructions in the way of our building and in other ways to molest our traders. The tirst indications of the effect of this process of intimidation became apparent soon after my return to Nasratabad. Mahomad Hayat, a British trader, had purchased for 500 krans a piece of ground in the city on which were standing the walls of a disused house. On 2nd May he began repairing the walls; but was immediately stopped and ordered to quit by one of the Amir's Sultans. I have already reported in a previous diary that Seth Suleiman, Agent of Messrs. Mahomad Ali Brothers, had in the same way been prevented from completing the roofing of one of his houses in the city. On 4th May I paid a private visit to the Amir. In the course of conversa tion 1 remarked that 1 thought his friendly feelings towards us must be on the wane, as signs were not wanting that beseemed to be less amicably disposed towards us. I pointed out the recent ill-treatment of a British subject from Peshawar who had been beaten by one of his own gunners, the refusal to allow Mahomad Hayat to* build on ground that had been sold to him, the case of Seth Suleiman’s house, etc. The Amir denied that his friendliness towards us had in any way diminished, and said that he could on no account allow us to purchase land and build on it either inside or outside the city without first obtain ing the permission of his Government. I argued that he had already given permission to Seth Suleiman last year to build, and that he was also aware of the fact when tne sale of land to Mahomad Hayat was taking place. Alsp that the Russian Vice-Consul had recently been permitted to build on land which he had bought. To all my arguments he replied that, until he received explicit orders from Teheran, he could not allow us to continue our building. After considerable dis cussion he concluded by drawing his chair towards mine and with a significant nod in the direction of the Russian Vice-Consulate said that “ our acquaintance over the way ” was still writing such exaggerated reports about himself and us and was pressing him so hard that he was really afraid to allow us to run on un checked, etc. But I pointed out that in treating us in this way the prestige of the British Government was suffering, and that the recent ill-treatment of British subjects was the talk of the bazaar. I told him I should hold him responsible for it. He finally promised that no obstruction should be offered to us outside the city, and that he would find a suitable house for Mahomad Hayat on hire inside the city. The following day I received a petition from the British trading community in Nasratabad begging for permission to build shops for their goods which were lying in the open and liable to damage from exposure. The petitioners stated that they 5 had been unable to obtain suitable houses on hire inside the city. This was quite possible for every house in the fort which is not already occupied is in ruins. Messrs. Tek Chand &amp; Co., being Hindus, washed also to build a house and godown in Trenchabad. I sent their petitions to the Amir by my head clerk, Gul Mahomad Khan, with a letter expressing the hope that, under the circumstances and in accordance with his promise of the day before, he w^ould allow the petitioners to build, or find a shelter for their goods. I pointed out that by Treaty he was bound to do this. The Amir returned the petitions wfith a reply that he could not allow any building, but that he would “ do his best for us.” He mentioned verbally to Gul Mahomad Khan that he possessed no copy of the Treaty. This was unsatisfactory, and I paid a second private visit to the Amir in the evening. 1 impressed on him the necessity, for his owm sake,I 2 of giving us some substantial assistance at this juncture. If he could not do so, and if suitable premises on hire could not be provided for the British traders whose merchandise was lying at his risk in the open, I said I should be compelled to begin building a shelter for them on the following morning, and that if my action was contrary to Treaty, he might report it to his Government. He finally agreed to my proposal and by the evening a suitable shop was offered to Mahomad Hayat on hire which he accepted. Meanwhile Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali had paid a visit to Mulla Mahomad Mehdi, the son of the old Mujtahid. The Mulla informed Abbas Ali that the Karguzar (the representative of the Persian Foreign Office) appeared to be much displeased with us, and that he was in Russian pay. He told Abbas Ali that he had just bought 45 roubles at 42 krans each from the Karguzar, and said that this was a portion of a money present w I ich Mr. Miller had recently- given to him (the Karguzar). I called on the Karguzar in the evening and mentioned the subject of our building. He said the Amir knew nothing about the Treaty, and that if l would write to him, mentioning the fact, he would arrange matters for us. The following morning during a visit to Seth Suleiman's private house in the city two of the Amir’s Sultans blustered into the court-yard with a bag of money- in their hands, saying that as the Amir w r as not allowed to sell property inside the city, they had been ordered to return the price of his house to Seth Suleiman, and that he must either vacate it or agree to take it on hire for the future. See ing that Seth Suleiman had purchased the property more than nine months ago and had considerably improved it, and that the deed of sale bore the signatures of nine witnesses, including that of the Head Mulla, I naturally objected to this summary treatment. I told the Sultans I could not allow Seth Suleiman to accept the money, and that the matter would be settled by me in the proper way. After my departure the Sultans returned and tried to force Seth Suleiman to accept the money. The Seth went to the Karguzar, taking with him the original deed of sale and also a document signed by the Amir which clearly proves that the Amir was not only cognisant of the sale of the property to the Seth, but that he had also assisted him to repair and build on the property. If therefore, as the Amir now maintains, it was contrary to orders to allow foreign traders to own land inside the fort, this was an incriminating document against the Amir. The Karguzar recommended the Seth to send these documents to him with a sakht (severe) covering letter about the Amir from the British Consul. It was at this point my suspicions were aroused that the Russian Vice-Consul and the Karguzar were working hand in hand through us to obtain incriminating evidence of incapa city and disrespect to foreigners against the Amir. During this time also the Russian Vice-Consul’s head clerk, a Persian, -who commands considerable respect here by reason of his religious enthusiasm and who has recently instituted, at Mr. Miller’s suggestion, a series of religious meet ings at his house with the object of disseminating any rumours the Russian Con sul may wish to spread abroad, quietly mentioned at one of these “ darbars ” that the Russian Vice-Consul was now working entirely in the interests of the people of Seistan ; that it was he who had arranged to have Seth Suleiman expelled, not only out of his house, but out of Seistan (vide Trade News at end of diary), becau e since the mercnants’ arrival here everything had become so expensive; that it was through his Agency that a Customs officer had come here to put heavy taxes on ghi, so that it should remain in the country and become cheap again ; and that it was the Russian Vice-Consul alone who had prevented our building, as we were eating up the land, and intended building a fort, etc. All this very soon became the talk of the bazaar, and it was necessary to inform the Amir. As I had already paid him three successive visits which had also set people talking, I managed to get Mulla Mahcmad Mehdi to induce the Amir to call on me, although the Mohurram Festival was still on. I told the Amir of the plot I had discovered and pointed out that as a proof of my friend ship towards him, I had withheld the incriminating documents which, there was no doubt, the Russian Vice-Consul had wished to possess himself of He seem* /«. j ed generally grateful and thanked me more than once.

This I did. But the Karguzar refused to give anything in writing to the Amir. Thus, while both the Amir and the Karguzar have admitted to me our right to build shops for British traders in Seistan, neither is willing to take the responsibility of granting us a formal permisiion in writing to do so. Meanwhile our building has continued without intermission. Messrs. Tek Chand’s new shop in Trenchabad only requires a roof to complete it. Mahomad Hayat occupies a good hired house in the city and the question of the return of the purchase money to Seth Suleiman has been dropped and will not, I hope, be brought up again. Thus has another of Mr. Miller’s schemes been thwarted. It is a fair specimen of the system of diplomatic intrigue which he practises here. The successive steps by which he hoped first to break up our friendship with the Amir, then through the Karguzar to obtain from us documents deroga tory to the Amir, and finally with these in his possession to bring about the down fall of the Amir himself, were as subtle as they were unscrupulous. There still remains the question of our ri^ht to purchase the land w'e are occupying and the limits within which we may build. It is a question which will continue to crop up and which will provide Mr. Miller with a fertile means of annoying us as long as he feels that he and his Government can interfere to influence the Persian Government in defining those limits for us. Mr. Miller has been busy of late in collecting the revenue and Customs statistics of Seistan. It may be possible that his Government may have some ulterior motives in view with regard to Seistan. In this connection I would invite a reference to the last few paragraphs of Major Trench’s diary for the period ist to 15th March 1901, and would urge the serious consideration of the question raised therein : ist May. —Nil. 2nd May .— Owing to the indisposition of Mr. Miller the Russian Vice-Con sulate party were unable to dine with me this evening. 3rd May —I called on Mr. Miller this morning. He is still confined to his bed and seemed in very low spirits. He hoped to undergo an operation in a few days. I offered Mr. Miller the services of Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali should he require assistance. 4th May .—As mentioned above, I had a private interview with the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk this morning. 2. Mons. Spinella, the representative of the Belgian Customs Department, arrived here this afternoon from Birjand. He is staying in the Russian Vice- Consulate. I had sent out a letter by special messenger to meet him to invite him to stay with me. Unfortunately the letter missed him and he naturally went to the Russian Consulate. 3th May. —Mons. Spinella came to call on me this evening. In the course of conversation he said that he always endeavoured to maintain an impartial attitude towards the rival powers in Persia; but that in whichever direction he saw trade preponderating in that direction it was politic to be more friendly. Trade, he said, was their bread and butter, and it would be short-sighted to obstruct its development. 6th May .—I paid a return visit on Mons. Spinella. After my call he paid an official visit on the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk. 2. I had a second private interview with the Amir in the evening (see above). yth May .—The late Customs representative here, Mirza Mahomad Hussain, was, together with four other Customs subordinates, thrown into chains this morning and imprisoned in his own house by order of Mons. Spinella. The charge against the Mirza is that he has defrauded the Persian Government of 4,000 tumans.. This man has hitherto been nothing less than a terror to our caravans in Seistan and his system of extortion has already been referred to in previous dtaries by Major Trench. His imprisonment must therefore have been a blow to Mr. Miller who undoubtedly gave his tacit support to these extortions ; but. following as it did on my visit to Mons. Spinella, the general idea.is that I was the means of bringing about their punishment. . I am told that Mr. Miller is taking the opportunity of Mons. Spinella’s visit to collect statistics regarding the Customs revenues of Seistan. Sth May. I called on the Karguzar in the evening (see above). 2. After leaving the Karguzar I paid a visit to the Mujtahid (Head Mulla) at his invitation. 1 he old man was very weak and could scarcely carrv on a conversation. As is his custom, he spoke in parables, the interpretation of which was that the actions of the British Government here were good and approved of by him and the people of Seistan. He said that the British subjects were popular here, because they always respected the Mahomedan religion. ^ ffi * 3 r A ^ ir L 1S Sai&lt; ?

Referring to the revenue-yielding possibilit^ of ^n^a'nVtie ^ir’s5 inability to pay up what was demanded of him, Mulla Mehdi remarked that, takin rT the population of Seistan at 20,000 which he considered a low estimate, the rev^ enue ought to be 60,000 even 100,000 Karwars of grain annually, whereas the Amir had only to pay the equivalent of 12,000 Karwars. (3) The Shaukat-ul-Mulk id Birjand had written to the Shah that Sardar Sayad Khan and Sardar Khan Jahan Khan, Narui Baluch, having left Seistan, were still waiting in Birjand for orders about their reinstatement. In reply the Shah had replied that he was shortly going to Meshed, and that as the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk of Seistan would be summoned there to meet him, the Sardars should come to Meshed also when he would arrange to give them back their property. Sardar Khan Jahan Khan had therefore summoned his nephew, who with his family was on the Afghan border, to Birjand. Mulla Mehdi remarked that Sardar Sayad Khan anti his party were the only powerful element in Seistan, and it would be well “if the British Govern ment could get hold of them.’' In this connection I would invite a reference to Major Trench s Secret Report No. 108-A., dated August 20th, 1900. nth May —The Anur returned my visit this evening. The interview was private. In the course of conversation he asked if more troops were being sent here. Perceiving that Mr. Miller’s exaggerated report about the 200 pilgrims must have reached his ears, I explained to him that he had been misinformed and that no more troops were coming except a few to relieve the escort which I had at present got with me here. 2. At Mons. Spinella s orders, the Customs subordinates now in prison were severely beaten last night. 12th May —Nil. 12th May .—The Russian Vice-Consul has been trying to bribe the Amir’s Tahwildar (officer in charge of grain) to induce him to give information on revenue matters and more especially as to the amount of grain which leaves Seistan for Robat and the postal thanas along the road. The Tahwildar came to inform me that he bad refused to give Mr Miller this information. 2. The Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk has received a letter by special messen ger from Tabbas that the people of Tabbas are very displeased with the present ruler, Abdul Kasim Khan, and that they had applied to the Shah for the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk to be sent back there. The appointment of the present ruler was made contrary to the wishes of the Sadr-i-Azam by the late Wali of Meshed, and the general opinion is that the Sadr-i-Azam will reinstate the Amir. The price of Tabbas, though, has been fixed at 20,000 tumans to the Shah and 8,000 tumans to the Wali of Meshed, and this sum the Amir cannot easily raise. His wife and mother-in-law who are Tabbas people have been pressing him for a long time to return there, and it is possible that he will make an effort to carry out their wishes. 3. A caravan of 42 Ta/ri Pathans from Kurram on a pilgrimage to Meshed arrived here this evening. They brought 1 wounded man and 2 wounded wmmen to the' hospital. Their story is that they were attacked by 12 armed Baluchis between Mushki Chah and Ware Chah on the Nushki-Seistan route about the 23rd April. A party of Hazara pilgrims also accompanied them and 5 in all had been wounded. One man (a Hazara) had died of his w'ounds at Saindak. They state that a passport for the road was refused them in Quetta until they produced sufficient money for their journey. They showed a sum of Rs. 4,500 to the 1st Assistant Agent to the Governor-General, Quetta, who signed and gave them the passport which they produced for my inspection. They say that all the money they possessed was looted from them as w r ell as clothes, jewellery, etc. I gave them food and shelter in the Consulate and their wounded—one only of whom is seriously hurt—are being treated in the hospital.rtfh May .— From the statements of the Kurram pilgrims it seems that one of their number, Mir Akhmad, Turi, accompanied the party which went in pursuit of the Baluch raiders and which was headed by the Jemadars of the Saindak and Mushki Chah thanas. This man states that, after following the tracks of the thieves for 6 days, they reached the village of Jihand Khan, the bamini Chief who admitted having committed the raid. I have as yet received no official report of the attack from any source, though it occurred 3 weeks ago. But as the men seem utterly destitute and it was undesirable in the interests of the trade route to give them an opportunity of spreading their story through Nasratabad—a story which in Mr. Miller’s hands would at once have been distorted to our disadvantage—I considered it advisable to get them out of the place as soon as possible. 1 am arranging to keep the seriously wounded man and Mir Akhmad (referred to above) here, and am giving the remainder Rs. 100 for expenses of the road to Meshed. Some of the party have been Government servants in the Kurram Militia in the Political Department, and one is an old Kurram Malik, who says he draws Rs. 50 annually from Government. I am submitting a separate report on this subject. The party of Hazara pilgrims has not arrived here yet. 1 have still to hear their story. 75/// May. —Mons. Spinella, the Customs Officer, paid me a visit this morning, lie came to explain to me the new Customs regulations which are to be introduced into Seistan. A duty of 5 per cent, on the value of merchandise and a “ rahdari ” tax of 1 £ krans per camel from camel*drivers is to be levied and paid at the first Customs Bureau on entering Persia. But Mons. Spinella interprets “ value of merchandise ” to mean “ original invoice price plus cost of transport to first Customs Bureau in Persian territory.” That is to say, that on goods imported, for example, from Manchester, a merchant in Seistan w r ould have to pay duty on the price of his goods plus the cost of carriage by steamer from England to Bombay, by rail to Quetta and by camel to Seistan. I objected and pointed out that such a system would be a death-blow to the Seistan route, for traders would naturally send their goods to Bunder Abbas, the steamer freight from Karachi to that port being very considerably less than the cost of steamer, rail and camel transport from Karachi to Seistan via Quetta. Bander Abbas being “ the first Customs Bureau in Persian territory ” for goods arriving from India, no Customs duty would be charged on transport of those goods from the coast to Seistan—a distance equal to that from Quetta to Seistan ; and yet it was proposed to charge Customs duty for the latter journey. This was placing the Seistan route at a decided disadvantage. I told Mons. Spinella that Messrs. Mahomad Ali Brothers’ Agent would shortly receive a large consignment of tea from China, and it would be absurd to make him pay Customs duty on the cost of transport from China to Seistan. After much discussion he finally agreed that the matter should be referred to our respective Governments, and that mean while the ad valorem duty of 5 per cent, should be charged on merchandise according to the original invoice only without cost of transport. 2 I am submitting a separate report on this subject to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed. Mons. Spinella proposes establishing small * About 18 miles north-west of Robat and on Customs thanas at Harmak,* Girdi and the southern limits of Seistan. Warmal on the road from fcobat to Nas ratabad. He asked to have one at Robat also ; but on my objecting he dropped the subject. I have stipulated that every Customs official shall be provided with . a distinctive uniform and a badge (a number, if possible) to w 7 ear on his arm or collar band. Mons. Spinella agreed to my proposals and said that his re presentatives would be posted only for the purpose of surveillance, to ensure that caravans did not evade the payment of Customs dues after entering Persian terri tory. 3. I paid Mr. Miller a visit this morning. He is still very indisposed, though able to move about. He referred to Captain Bode, the retired German Naval Officer, who is now staying with me. He asked me if I thought that permission would be granted to Captain Bode to use the route to Quetta.

I told him that the question would have to be settled between his Foreign Office and mine. 4 * ^r. Miller left here suddenly at midday. He is said to have gone to Sekohe to attend a patient. He left a man seriously ill in his hospital here and shortly after his departure the man died. The relations of the dead man are now freely denouncing Dr. Miller. 5 . Mons. Spinella dined with me in the evening. The Russian Vice-Consu late were unable to come owing to Mr. Miller’s indisposition and the absence of Dr. Miller. 6. The weather during the past fortnight has been abnormally hot. Trade News. Messrs. Mahomad Ali Brothers’ Agent has received a large consignment of miscellaneous goods, most of which are destined for Meshed and a small pro portion for Birjand. . 1 he Agent, Seth Suleiman, proposes going to Meshed him self in a few weeks time to open a large shop there. Camels are still very scarce in Birjand, and there is great difficulty in obtaining through transport to Quetta, the local camel-men refusing to go beyond Seistan. 1 have managed to send a few of the Quetta camels, recently arrived, to Birjand. Messrs. Mahomad Ali’s Agent in Birjand informs me that a caravan of 80 camels with caraway seeds, Kandil, etc., has already left Birjand, but that other camels will have to be engaged here for the onward journey to Quetta. I hear from Birjand that the traders there are very pleased with the idea of the opening up of the new route via the Palang Koh—a report on which I submitted with my last diary. The Quetta and Birjandi camels cannot stand the Seistan fly and grass, and the new route should therefore prove a boon to them at this time of the year. In a conversation which I had recently with the Agent of the Muawin-ut- Tajar at Meshed, Mahomad Akbar Khan, he told me that he had received orders some time ago to select and send to Meshed the names of the largest villages in Seistan, as the Muawin-ut-Tajar at Meshed was in treaty with the Shah for the purchase of them. The Agent informed me that he had sent the names of 24 villages to Meshed. He told me that there was a rumour here that many enquiries were being made in Teheran and Meshed just at present about the revenue and limits of Seistan, and that one Mirza Mahomad Hussain, who some years previously was Mustaufi in Seistan, but was now in Meshed, could furnish the Meshed Government with as much information as they required about the place.

He represents that any such action would be fatal to rapidly expanding Indian trade, and constitute grave ulterior menace to Baluchistan, and that Seistan should not in any circumstances be allowed to pass directly or indirectly under Russian control. He suggests that an intimation to Persian Government of interest which His Majesty’s Government take in Seistan, and of our inability to acquiesce in its extinction, might forestall any such move if contemplated. Have you reason to think there is any foundation for this rumour, and do you consider it desirable to say anything to Persian Government ?

Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs has evidently misunderstood position I have assumed in regard to house question. Japanese Minister is telegraphing to Tokio to explain that present question between myself and Corean Government is simply house question, and not question of Mr. Brown’s dismissal; and that I have never contested right of Corean Govern ment to dispose of Corean Government buildings, but am only asking for reasonable notice for removal to be given. At audience for presentation of Japanese naval officers to-day Japanese Minister, by instruction of his Government, advised the Emperor to cancel loan agreement. His Majesty expressed desire to repudiate transaction, and said he was disinclined to grant audience asked for by French Minister in order presumably to press loan question. Mr. Clio Pyeng Sik, infliiential Councillor of State, who had originally supported the loan, had, His Majesty stated, sent in his resignation and memorialized against the loan. Japanese Minister also informs me that Russian Minister at Tokio has, under instructions from his Government, explained that no Russian subjects are connected with loan. At audience to-day Japanese Minister suggested to Emperor dismissal from office of Mr. Yi Yong Yik. I have sent in note to-day to Foreign Minister, and applied for audience. Japanese Minister will send in application for audience to-morrow and explain at the same time object. Delay of a few days probable before audience on same day is granted us.

Grazing of course is what every camelman looks for Bhusa or ata only being given when camels are tired, or have not time to graze. The grazing on the Nushki-Robat section compares favourably with the Persian sec ion. In order to increase the popularity of our road, bhusa Should be more plentiful.

The cold in the winter is very severe, prices of bhusa and gram are high and Quetta itself affords no immediate means of grazing.

White at Ahabad, the third march from Nasratabad towards Neh and Birjand, I was told of a direct route leading from there to Robat, which avoided the swamps of Seistan, and effected a saving of about 60 miles on the routes from Birjand, Meshed and Herat to India. The fact that the route avoids the swamp of Seistan is in itself a very great advantage As I had not time to travel over the route, I asked Maiof enn to travel by it and if it was suitable for camels to make any improvements abng it which he thought necessary. Major Benn has now written to say that he finds the route ideal for camels, and a saving of 68 miles in the distance from Ahabad to Robat. The water question along the route seems to require improvement, but Major Benn, who now has a personal acquaintance with the road is doing all he can to remove defects. Full details of the road will be found in the Seistan diaries.2 At Birjand I was well received by all classes of people. The Shaukat-ul- Mulk, who made the first call on me, was very friendly. At times he has been thought to be under the influence of the Russians. I do not believe this to be true in the least. Of the two Amirs, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk and the Hashmat-ul- Mulk, the former is the more open in his hostility to the Russians. He has been several times complained of by Mr. Miller for the disrespect he has shown to Russian officers passing through Kaniat. I found in conversation that the Shaukat-ul-Mulk thoroughly understood the political significance of the Seistan route and was prepared to hail with joy the counteracting influence of England, which w'ould save Persia from the grip of Russia. One intelligent Persian described the position of Russia as a high wall which was preparing to fall and smother them. The dread of being absorbed by Russia is with every Persian, and the more imminent it appears, the greater grows his hatred of the Power, w T ho, he says, has done nothing but ruinad his country. The Amir Shaukat-ul-Mulk holds these opinions strongly, and sinde the Seistan route has been opened, has thrown himself entirely on to our side, believing that now, for the first time in history, England is really in a position to check Russia’s designs to absorb Persia. Whether England will use to the full advantage the influence which she now possesses by right of position in Seistan is sometimes expressed as a doubt in the minds of those who are intelligent enough to read the writing on the w r all. I have been loud in my assurances that England will not neglect Persia for the future, that the new route will bring Indian traders who will settle over Persia, and that British interests will so counterbalance Russian interests that Persia herself wdll from her central posi tion obtain stability. Not only to the Amir Shaukat-ul-Mulk, did I openly enlarge on the coming influence of England in Persia, through the Seistan route, but at every place on the way from Seistan to Meshed, did I address large crow'ds, and tell them that an ancient Kingdom such as Persia was, did not so easily succumb through intrigue, and pressure from Russia. I told them that in the future Persians would go to India to receive their education, that the friendly intercourse w r hich will spring up between the two countries could bring nothing but benefit to both sides. I flattered the peasantry for their manly appearance and generally endeavoured to raise their spirits, and point to coming prosperity. By high and low I was asked numerous questions, but the idea of one and all was—save us from the Russians who have ruined the country, and who now are influencing the Shah to the detriment both of himself and Persia. I have found that it is a mistake to suppose that the Persian average man has resigned himself to his fate. On the contrarv, he frequently declares that Russia has not yet succeeded in absorbing his country and says she never will. At many gatherings round my tent the people were enthusiastic, and many must now know more of the political significance of the Nushki route than they did before. One peasant from the crowd remarked he had heard that the Rus sian Consul in Seistan was not able to draw breath outside his house, which remark was received with popular applause by the rest. Among the merchants with whom I spoke in private while in Birjand, I found them all sharing the same views, and eager to make earlv use of the new route to India. Nor was this eagerness mere flattery, for all 'the leading mer chants have made or are making preparations to start caravans to India by Quetta. I frequently heard the remark that the Bunder Abbas route was now a thino- of the past, that trade with that port was not true trade, for they were in the hands of middle men at Bundar Abbas, and could not be free choosers of Indian and English goods. I I stayed 10 days in Birjand and to all with whom I came in contact with my conversation was on the above theme, just as it always had been in Seistan. Ihe effect on all I found to be the same. They at once warmed up and became Inendly, or enthusiastic. There is n&lt; is slowly finding force of the mi existent. I did men in Meshed am forced to sa While in B who was being i .footing.

I noticed on my way to Meshed that the force of the movement lessened as I got further north, but was never non existent. I did my best to stimulate it, and look forward to seeing the leading men in Meshed rouse themselves, and throw off the baneful influence which I am forced to say Russia exerts over Persia. While in Birjand I met Mr. Spineka, one of the Belgian customs officials, who was being sent to Seistan, to place the customs collection there on a better ,footing.. I had a long talk with him. He promised to remove at once all the difficulties which u’e had had with the Persian subordinates there. He even said he intended removing these views altogether, and punishing them for the way they had robbed the customs department. If he does this, it will be good, for these Persian customs subordinates were in the pay of the Russian Vice-Consul, and ordered to obstruct our trade as much as possible. Mr. Spineka, who is an Italian, assured me that he and the Belgian customs iofficials were no party to this obstructive policy, that they wished to encourage the trade by all routes, for their own benefit. I showed him a map of Seistan, and pointed out the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of catching the caravans which from all directions make for the Nushki route. Many not even passing Robat, and most avoiding Seistan proper, on account of the water. He said he thought that al any rate it would be best not to interfere with Afghan caravans who cut across Seistan to avoid the duties at Kandahar. An idea has struck me whether later when the Belgians find it impossible to collect their dues from the caravans passing from Eastern Persia to Persia, whether w r e might not help them, by allowing them to collect their dues our side of the border on the Nushki route, on condition that we appointed our owm man to watch the collection. The Belgians by some such arrano-ement would largely increase their income. We should gain by having the collection under our immedi ate supervision, and the traders would be saved from being harassed bv unscrupulous Sowars, as they crossed the Seistan deserts. Two marches out of Turbat-i-Haideri I was met by Colonel Temple and Mr. Coote. My reception in Turbat-i-Haideri was good. I made a point of having a long talk with the Governor there, as usuaL eiilarging on the political importance to Persia of the present juxtaposition of India with Persia. I reached Meshed on the 30th April, and so brought to a close my deputa* tion to Seistan which had lasted just over a year. G.

The past fortnight has again been marked by the efforts of the Russian Vice-Consul to accomplish what he has been steadily working for si~.ce my arrival here, Wj., the destruction of our prestige and the dissolution of our friendly relations with the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk. To effect this object he has had many irons in the fire, and it has been somewhat uphill work trying to parry the repeated blows he has been dealing. The latter have been directed mainly at our building operations and the trade route ; while, by the tacit en couragement of pettv insults to British subjects on the part of the Persian soldiery,—insults which have necessitated repeated applications to the Amir for redress,—he has hoped to bring about a breach of my friendship with the Amir. 2. In a former Diary I reported that our traders were being prevented from erecting shops both inside and outside the city ; but that no actual withdrawal of our masons and local coolies had taken place. By hook or by crook I had managed to circumvent the obstruction and quietly continue the building. On the 2nd June I received letters from Colonel Chenevix-Trench, enclosing copies of despatches received from H. B. M’s Minister at Tehran, to the effect that orders had been sent direct to Seistan to allow British Indian traders to acquire land and erect shops. These orders, however, have not yet reached the Amir direct from Tehran, though three posts have already been received from Meshad. 3. I have been engaged in erecting some godowns for supplies, and burning bricks for the new Vice-Consulate. On the 4th June two out of the four masons employed on this work were removed by the Amir’s orders. On the yth the remaining two were ordered away. I have been unable to obtain any masons since then and work has been at a standstill. 4. On the 9th June the Meshad post arrived. 1 here w’as a letter from Teh ran for the Amir in the Vice-Consulate bag. In the evening I sent my Munshi, Gul Mahomad Khan, to visit the Amir’s Nazar and enquire about the stoppage of our work. The Nazar said that no orders had reached the Amir. When the Munshi pointed out that permission for us to build had been arrangea between the British and Persian Governments at Tehran, and that the Mushir-ud-Dowlah had informed H. B. M’s a in’ster that orders would be sent direct to the ronir authorizing him to grant us that permission, the Nazar hinted that Persian offici als had a trick of sending two letters by the same post one to give the promised order, and the other to nullify it. 5. On the 10th June I had an interview with the Amir. He also told me that he had received no permission to allow us to build and he sent for the letter he had received from Tehran to show me. It contained instructions for him to undertake the immediate repair of the guns in the fort. I asked him if he was aware that all our work had been stopped by the withdrawal of our masons. He said that it was by his own orders that they had been removed, and that he must insist on our doing no further building until he received distinct permission from his Government. The only orders he had were not to allow us to build, and of these orders, he said, the Russian Consul was very well aware. I pointed out to him that in putting obstacles in the way of British traders he was not only acting in defiance of all Treaty engagements between the British and Persian Governments, but that he was running the risk of losing our friendship. I told him that l had received copies of the correspondence that had taken place bet ween H. B. M’s Minister at Tehran and the Mushir-ud-Dowlah on this subject. To all my advice and arguments the Amir turned a deaf ear. He again told me that the Russian Consul had been sending exaggerated reports • about him every week to Tehran, and that it was 7 more than his position was worth to ignore the threats of expulsion which Mr. Miller levied at him whenever 1he showed us any friendship. Mr. Miller seemed to have really alarmed the Amir. I finally managed to get. a promise out of the Amir that our coolies employed at the brick kiln should not be interfered with and that he would do nothing that would diminish our prestige. He has so far kept his promise that up to date (17th June) the making of bricks continues, and by way of giving us some excuse to explain the discontinuance of our building, he has himself employed all our masons who are the best in Nasratabad, to repair the fort. 6. On the 16th June another Meshed post arrived. In my own private envelope was a letter despatched by the Governor of Meshed through Colonel Trench to the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk. It was natural to suppose that this act of confidence on the part of the Governor was a mark ot friendship towards Colonel Trench. 1 sent the letter to the Amir at once. In the evening, though the City gates were locked, the Amir sent me a letter to say he had received orders about our building, but that they were to the effect that we were on no account to exceed the limit of ground already sanctioned (5,000 square yards) and that no more land could be given to our traders. I have since obtained a copy of this letter. It is dated tyth Sa f ar (5th June), and it would appear that no orders had reached the Governor at Meshed from Tehran up to that date ; for the Governor proposes writing to Tehran for orders about the acquisition of land by us in Seistan. As the new hospital buildings, my own temporary quarters, and the clerks and servants’ houses already occupy a larger amount of ground than the above, this was tantamount to ordering us to discontinue further building. It would seem that the Nazar’s remark to my Munshi, mentioned in paragraph 4 above, contained a warning of what we might expect. Information has just reached me that the Amir has issued orders forbidding masons and coolies to work in Trenchabad under pain of a public beating and a fine. The general opinion here is that the Russian Consul’s power of intimidation from Tehran has tem porarily won the day, that we have for the moment received a check ; but that other orders are sure to follow which will nullify the present ones and allow us to build. The people are sympathetic, and I have received a message of encouragement from the Mullahs. 7. Meanw'hile my position here has become a little difficult. The new^s has naturally reached our traders here from Meshed that orders have been sent to the Amir to allow the erection of shops, and that 1 can now obtain sites for them. At the Darbar of British Indian subjects which I hold every Monday, the Agent of Sheik Faiz Mahomad, a Meshed tiader, requested me publicly to allow him to select a site for a new shop as his master had written to him to say that he could now have no excuse for not carrying out his original orders. Messrs. Tek Chand &amp; Co., have asked to build another shop next to the one they have just completed ; while their head firm at Shikarpur have written to me to obtain permis sion for their Agents to construct a whole bazar near Trenchabad, so that more Shikarpuri merchants may be sent here in the cold weather. A Karachi firm of merchants has also arrived, and, though they will build their main shop in Birjand, they intend opening a small branch here. To all these gentlemen I have had to give evasive answers.. 1 cannot even get them hired houses in the city; for there are none to be had fit to live in. Those available need roofing or repair ; and this the Amir refuses to allow. I have allowed one merchant to*occupy an empty room in the new hospital for the present. I need scarcely point out that the necessity for immediate orders reaching me on this subject is most urgent. To frustrate Mr. Miller's scheme I had suggested getting masons from Birjand, so as to be independent of local labour; but the Nazar told my Munshi that in the face of present orders the Amir would then withdraw our coolies, and in any case he would object to our occupying ground. The Russian Consul doubtless thinks that he has scored a point; it cannot be denied that his repeated promises to the people that he would have our building stopped have, for the moment at any rate, been fulfilled. 8 Mr. Miller has been busy in another direction. Our merchants have been given much unnecessary trouble by the Customs Department. I fear that Mons. Spinella, the Customs Officer, a guest of the Russian Consul, has been much influenced by his host. On the excuse of directing the construc tion of the new Customs Godowms and Offices, Mr. Miller generally attendsat the Customs ground, and he is always there when any Quetta caravan arrives. Lately we have had many arrivals here and Messrs. Seth Suleiman and others have been subjected to much inconvenience, in the form of unnecessary deten tion of goods which, as the godowns are still unfinished, have to lie in the open exposed to the sun. On my representing the matter, Mons. Spinella has always been willing to assist me; but the discomfort to the traders has meanwhile been effected. 9. Mr. Miller has been visiting the villages in the neighbourhood and on the Afghan border. He has been reminding the Khatkhudas of the order which prohibits the export of grain from Seistan and threatens to have them punished if any finds its may to Robat. He has also, as reported in my last Diary, again been instigating the Khatkhudas to resist the oppression of the Amir and to seek the protection of the Russian flag. Mr. Miller’s attention of late has been much directed to the Afghan border and Chikansur, and to acquiring information regarding the grain producing capabilities of the latter district. I have just heard that he wishes to build a house in Deh Dost Mahomad on the Afghan border. This has been the result of his recent tour in that direction. Khatkhuda Dost Mahomad has been to see me and I gather Mr. Miller will have some difficulty in obtaining his object. I was able to arrange for per mission for Messrs. Tek Chand to open a branch shop in Deh Dost Mahomad and I hope to be able to make a short tour out there as soon as possible. As I have had Captain Bode, whose movements had to be watched, and other guests in my house for the last nine w’eeks, and the situation of affairs rendered my presence here necessary, 1 have been confined to Nasratabad. 10. I have already submitted a report • on the recent insult offered to •No. 54 of ,4th June. me and the assault made by a Persian soldier on one of my chaprassis on the 10th June. I have no doubt whatever that the repeated instances of dis respectful conduct on the part of the artillery detachment here, and the petty thefts which preceded the final insult to myself and the assault on my chaprassi, if not prompted were at least encouraged by Mr. Miller in the hope that my repeated applications for redress w r ou!d bring about a dissolution of my friendship with the Amir. He would also use the incident to induce the people to believe that our popularity was on the wane. That this is not so may be proved by the fact that Trenchabad still continues to be a favourite rendezvous for the people every evening. Our weekly Tent-pegging enter tainment has been, perhaps, more crowded than ever. I always make a point of myself taking part in the sport. A Gramophone, which I have recently imported, attracts large crowds to the Consulate twice in the week. We always seem to be providing some new form of amusement for the people, while the Russian does nothing in this way. n. Mr. Miller has now quite recovered his health. His recent illness seems to have stimulated him to much activity, as the events of the past fortnight will have proved. 12.—Miscellaneous news. The u Bad-o-Sad-o-Bist Roz ” or Seistan wind has begun. 13. On 3rd June Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali, whom I had sent to Robat to inspect the large pilgrim caravan from Patna, returned to Nasrat abad. He heard that the caravan w r ould not arrive for a fortnight. It seems that owing to scarcity of water the caravan had to break up into small parties. They have just arrived here, and complain bitterly of the treatment they have received from the Persian caravan leaders, whom they engaged in Quetta. The leaders’ names are Agha Mahomad and Akram Khan. The former took the first representative caravan from Birjand in February last and was given everv respect and assistance on his journey by Colonel Trench, Captain Webb-Ware and myself. In return he has been the reverse of grateful. Messrs. Foley and Penton received nothing but discomfort at his hands ; so much so that they paid him Rs. 200 to be rid of the main caravan. Akram Khan, I have since ascertained, went to Quetta in the Russian Consul’s pay, and it is entirely due to him that my orders to the caravan to use the new Palang Koh route have been evaded. I am trying to settle matters between the Patna Nawabs and Akram Khan. 3V / i he Nawab’s party consists of about 200 men, women and children. They assert that they have no embalmed corpses with them. As their heavy baggage is behind, 1 have been unable to verify this statement. 14. On 6th June Captain Bode left Seistan en route for Charbar. He had been with me for nine weeks. 15. News has reached here of the reception accorded to Colonel Trench on his arrival in Meshed. The remarks I hear about his “ Istikbal ” are most flattering. It has also become known that Colonel Trench holds private inter views with the Nayar-ud-Daulah. This has had a very good effect here. 16. Mons. Zaroudny and his party arrived here on 7th June after touring via the Perso-Baluch border to the coast. I have already submitted a separate report on this, giving details of Mons. Zaroudny’s tour. I have received the following secret information about his doings :—“ The party visited Kaj-Mekran, piercing a range of mountains, where they stayed 12 days. Mons. Zaroudny made sketches and maps of the country and made notes on the tribes, flora and fauna, etc., Another informant tells me that Mons. Zaroudny has made “ four books of maps ” during his tour, Mons. Zaroudny has now gone on a visit to the “ Naizar ” or reed swamp, &lt;0 miles from here. 17. Herr Lomer, the German artist, was prevented by the Amir’s soldiers from sketching in the city. He had apparently been unwi.ling to grease the palm of the Amir’s officials. Herr Lomer left Seistan on the i^th after staying with me for a fortnight. 18. Mr. Foley, of the Indian Tea Association, left here on 16th for Birjand. 19. Mons. Spinella, the Customs Officer, is returning to Meshed at once. He will be succeeded by Mons. Molitor, a Belgian, who has already started for Seistan. Mons. Spinella will travel along the Perso-Afghan border as far as Karez. From there he told me he would try to reach Herat disguised as a Per sian. He seemed to be talking seriously. A question has arisen here regarding the importation of arms, and ammu nition into Persia. By the new Customs rules the importation is strictly prohibited. Mons. Spinella has seized a rifle sent as a present by Captain Webb-Ware to the Amir’s son. Sarhang Mahornad Raza Khan. The Sarhang applied to me to release it for him. I saw M. Spinella and pointed out that the rifle was no merchandise, but that it should be regarded as a present from one Government to another and that as such 1 thought it should be exempt from seizure. M. Spinella would not admit this and has detained the rifle pending a reference of the case to Meshed. I have also referred the matter to Colonel Trench. As the Sartip is bringing Government presents of arms, etc., with him from India, I trust that orders will reach me before his arrival here. In the course of conversation on this subject I referred to M. Zaroudny’s having brought Rus sian rifles down from Meshed. M. Spinella said that all M. Zaroudny’s rifles were seized in Meshed, but were released on it being explained that he was proceed ing on a scientific mission. M. Zaroudny had to sign a certificate that he would give back all his rifles on return from tour to the Customs Department. I asked how he could explain the fact that M. Zaroudny had rifles to spare to give away as presents along the Perso-Baluch border. M.'Spinella said that M. Zaroudny must have defrauded the Customs and smuggled the rifles by some other road. R.

Bonn, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul for Seistan, No. 7, for period from 12th to 30th April 1901. 12M April 1901.—As mentioned in my last diary, I had intended leaving Nasratabad to-day on a short tour to report on the proposed new caravan route from hobat via the Palang Koh to Neh and Birjand. Owing, however, to the unexpected arrival of Captain-Lieutenant Bode, whose movements appeared to he somewhat mysterious, I deemed it advisable to postpone my departure for a few days. The Russian Vice-Consul paid me a visit during the day. He came to assure me that the stranger was not a Russian subject, and that he would in no way be responsible for his future movements. 13th April .—During the night Captain Bode left Nasratabad for Warmal in the direction of Robat. I sent my Head Clerk, Gul Muhammad Khan, to inform him that he would not be allowed to cross the frontier into Baluchistan. Munshi Gul Muhammad Khan, after delivering my message, returned in the evening with a letter from Captain Bode, enclosing his passport for my inform ation, and requesting me to grant him permission to travel by the Nushki route to Quetta. I replied that a reference to the Government of India would he * Letter to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor- General in Baluchistan, No. 9, dated the 13th April 1901.

Having arranged to have Captain Bode’s movements watched, and having warned all the thanas between this and Robat of his presence in the neighbour hood, I sent off my camp to Behring where I follow it to-morrow. llth April .—March to Behring, 30 miles. I received a letter from Captain Bode informing me of his intention to wait in Seistan until he could obtain permission to use the Nushki route. 15th April .—March to Bandan, 36 miles. 16^ April .—March to Aliabad, 28 miles. At this point roads from Birjand via Neh and Shuop, from Meshed via Gazik, from Herat, from Seistan and from Robat via the Palang Koh, converge. The latter is the route I am about to follow. The Khatkhuda of Aliabad is a respectable and friendly old man. He gave me very great assistance, and is keenly interested in the development of the short cut from Birjand via his village to Robat. As no supplies and very little water exist at the stages ahead of me, I decided to send back half my escort from here. Further details regarding the road from this point will be found in the separate report attached to this diary. llth April .—March to Madeh, 14 miles. There is a good road the whole way. The guide pitched my camp at a spring about half a mile to the north of the ruined fort which exists here,where the water was quite undrinkable. A very good karez exists close to the fort which requires only a little digging to produce a good flow of drinkable water. All springs except the one at the karez should be avoided, as they are very saline. necessary, and that a reply would take over a month to reach me.

I discovered that this place is usually avoided by caravans for this reason. There is a slightly brackish spring here, which is the only water that exists on the direct line between Safidawa and Harmak via the Shela river—a distance of about 90 miles. A large party of Kakar Pathans from Zhob were encamped here for the purpose of collecting assafetida. The country we passed through to-day abounds with wild asses and deer. Two herds of the former passed quite close to us. 20th April .—March to Girde Thana (via Gali Chah), 38 miles. April .—March to Nasratabad, 60 miles. On my return here to-day, I found that the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk had during my absence sent for Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali, and asked him to discontinue building a wall which was in process of construction round the new hospital buildings and the Hospital Assistant’s quarters. The Amir remarked that he had given us permission to build hospital quarters and not a “ fort Abbas Ali, who is a married man, had raised the wall round his house to a height of 15 to 20 feet in order that the interior might not be overlooked. The Russian Vice-Consul, it seems, took the opportunity to point out to the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk the resemblance the hospital enclosure bore to the outer walls of a fort with the result above mentioned. In deference to the Amir’s wishes, Abbas Ali promised to discontinue the enlargement of the wall until my return. It is now the MohurraYn festival when all work is at a temporary stand-still, and the further construction of the wall must, as a matter of course, also cease. The Amir was doubtless aware of this fact, and thus found it easy to pacify Mr. Miller without in any way putting us to any inconvenience. When the Mohurram festival is over, I hope to visit the Amir and set matters straight. 22nd April .—Captain Bode came to call on me officially to-day. During my absence on tour he has been living in a bazaar hovel lent him by the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and has been taking his meals with Seth Suleiman, Agent of Messrs. Muhammad Ali Bros. I was much struck with his gentlemanly manners and conversation, and invited him to come and stay with me. He has accepted the invitation and will come over to the British Vice-Consulate to-morrow. He told me that he had been much annoyed since his arrival here by the Russian Vice-Consul, who had sent Cossacks to “converse” with him daily, and to induce him to visit the Russian Vice-Consulate. He had refused to do so until my return. Captain Bode is a much travelled officer and a talented linguist. He has travelled through France, Italy, Spain, Russia, Turkistan and Persia. . The account he gives of his recent journey through Turkistan is most interesting. He was permitted to travel through Kokand as far as Andijan on the Russian railway and from there to Osh, which he describes as the “ prettiest place in Asia ”. He then tried to cross the frontier to Kashgar, but was not allowed to do so by the Russian authorities at Osh. He^was also refused permission to visit Khiva and to travel south of Merv by the Kushk Railway. He now hopes to reach Kashmir and to travel via Leh to Kashgar. 23rd April .—A resident of Peshawar, a British subject, recently arrived here on a pilgrimage to Meshed, and has been practising as a Native Doctor with the object of collecting some money for his onward journey. Yesterday one of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s gunners attacked and seriously injured him in the Husainabad bazaar on what has since been proved to be a false charge of indecent assault on a woman with whom the gunner was himself on familiar terms. The gunner induced some by-standers to join in the assault, and the Peshawari’s lungi and some clothes were also stolen from his person. The man was then dragged before the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, who released him as innocent; but n&lt; came to me and, a letter to the Ai ing that, as the might be given t public punishmt investigate the n satisfaction has subject on the ea Mulla Muh successor, sent fo has much comrm openly as the R disarms suspicioi anti-British; buf occasion he told ' had informed hi] Amir’s orders re endeavouring to Vice-Consulate, local Seistani gu expense.

The Peshawari then came to me and, after satisfying myself that his statements were correct, I wrote a letter to the Amir (as it was the Mohurram I could not call on him) demand ing that, as the Peshawari was a British subject, a suitable public punishment might be given to the gunner. The Amir replied that he could administer no public punishment during the Mohurram, but that after the festival he would investigate the matter more fully. I do not intend to let the matter drop until satisfaction has been given, and shall speak to the Amir personally on the subject on the earliest opportunity. Mulla Muhammad Mehdi, son of the Mujtahid and destined to be his successor, sent for Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali to-day. Mulla Mehdi seldom has much communication with us, though he is at heart our friend. By posing openly as the Russian Vice-Consul’s friend and apparently ignoring us, he disarms suspicion and has lulled Mr. Miller into the belief that he is entirely anti-British; but he is in this way occasionally able to help us. On the present occasion he told Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali that the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk had informed him that the Russian Vice-Consul had been responsible for the Amir’s orders regarding the hospital wall. He also said that Mr. Miller was endeavouring to induce the Amir to force us to have a Persian guard on the Vice-Consulate. We have never had one hitherto, nor do we require one. A local Seistani guard is not only undesirable, but would also be an unnecessary expense. The Russian Vice-Consulate is encircled by a high wall, and a Persian guard is stationed at the entrance gate. It is, therefore, generally possible for us to learn who Mr. Miller’s visitors are and to obtain other items of information. As Trenchabad is encircled by no wall and lies in the open, Mr. Miller perhaps feels that he stands at a disadvantage in this respect. I do not think the Amir will mention the subject to me. The Russian Vice-Consul asked the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk some time ago for a plot of ground near the fort on which he proposed building a “caravanserai”. The Amir gave him an evasive answer, and has meanwhile given the land to the agent of the Moin-ut-Tujjar of Meshed who has been here some months with the object of assisting caravans by the Nushki route. I am told here that the Moin-ut-Tujjar and one Saiyid Ghulam Raza, son of Haji Abdul Kasim Khan, a big Meshed trader, are in treaty with the Shah for the purchase of Seistan. At present there is said to be a difficulty regard ing the price. 2Uh April .—I dined with the Russian Vice-Consul. Mr. Miller has been seriously indisposed for some time; but he was able to receive us at dinner. He appears to be in very bad health. 25^ April .—The new hospital buildings were completed to-day. They consist of a dispensary, a small office, an operation room and the Compounder’s quarters. The average daily atttendance at the dispensary is 30. 2G^ April. —Mr. Miller is suffering from a distressing complaint, for which Dr. Miller, his brother, tells me he will probably have to undergo an operation. Tlth April .—The Russian Vice-Consulate party dined with me in the evening. 28£/&amp; April .—The emissary Miya Abdul Kasim Khan, who has come from Meshed to recover the balance of revenue due by the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, has been unable to realise any of the money. The Amir offers to give him the grain, and says he has got no money. There is a rumour that two regiments of Persian infantry are to be sent here shortly to be quartered on the Amir until he pays up. 29^ April .—During a public Darbar in the city yesterday, at which my informant was present, the head Mulla said that Seistan must eventually fall into the hands of the “ feringi ”, and that it would be better for it to fall into the hands of the British who respected the Muhammadan religion.4 30/A April .—Complaints hare reached me from Quetta regarding one Jehangir Khan, a Seistani Baluch, who gave the local authorities much un necessary trouble about some petty loss he had suffered on the road. This Jehangir Khan was a member of a caravan which travelled to Quetta some months ago. It was afterwards discovered that he was in Russian pay, and was sent to Quetta to gain some information about the road and with the object of damaging its reputation by false reports. He has now returned here and has been giving an account of his journey to the Russian Vice-Consul. He is said to have informed Mr. Miller that Captain Webb Ware had gone to Mirjawa with “ 100 infantry ” to build a fort. Mr. Miller replied that Mons. Zaroudny (the naturalist referred to in my diary No. 3), who was returning to Seistan, would be able to give him full information on the subject. I hear from other sources that Mons. Zaroudny is expected here shortly. Trade News. 1. The Armenian merchant, Mons. Istatoroff, has left Seistan. He aban doned his trip to Koh-i-Malik Siah, but left money with an agent to buy wool and ghi .. He took 10 camel-loads of wool with him. He intends returning to Seistan in four months’ time, bringing with him goods which he considers he will be able to sell cheaper here than British merchants, such as petroleum, Russian cloth and sugar. Before his departure he tried to arrange for the construction of a wine distilling apparatus, and ordered about 40 larsre recep tacles for grapes. The head Mulla, however, protested and warned him not to introduce the apparatus into Seistan. 2. A Hindu merchant, Tek Chand, a partner in the firm of Messrs. Chaman Singh &amp; Co. of Shikarpur, arrived here during the past week. This firm, as reported in previous diaries, has already got an agent here. Tek Chand has now asked for permission to build and open shops in Trenchabad and Husainabad (the village adjacent to the Nasratabad Fort). He has brought a large quantity of indigo in addition to other merchandise. The former he will take to Birjand and probably to Meshed. 3. A large caravan of nearly 100 camels belonging to Messrs. Muham mad Ali Bros, arrived here during the week. Most of the merchandise is destined for Birjand, but I am arranging that all the camels shall go to pick up the loads awaiting transport there. They will return from Birjand to Quetta by the new Palang Koh route. 4. Camel drivers here are complaining against a “rahdari” tax of krans per camel which the customs officials have lately introduced. The Customs Collector came to see me on the subject, as the camelmen had one and all refused to pay. I arranged with him that the settlement of the case should be allowed to stand over until the arrival of Mons. Spinella, the Belgian Customs officer, who is expected to arrive in a day or two. The Birjand-Bohat route via the Falavg Koh. . A glance at the attached map* will show that the most direct route from Birjand and Neh to Robat lies along the eastern slopes of the Palang Koh as far as Harmak. This route, however, has hitherto been unpopular and little used, preference being given to the more circuitous road via Nasratabad and Seistan. The reasons given are that the former is deserted and waterless,6 ■ whereas * Birjand to Robat vid Palang Koh.

Surkhl was quite impracticable for laden camels, and that for this reason it was invariably avoided by caravans I abandoned the idea of including it in the new alignment. The route described below is the one which I now recommend and which I have already taken stens to make popular:— J ^ Birjand to Aliabad Aliabad to— (1) Madeh ... 146 miles. 14 miles. . _ l eve l roa( l ^be whole way, with camel grazing in plenty on either side. This place has already been described by Khan Bahadur Maula Bux On his Journey from Meshed to Quetta, April in the marginally noted report in which 1898—pa^e 68 of the printed report. he mentions that, if repopulated, the place would make a good halting place for caravans going from Persia and Afghanistan to Quetta by Koh-i-Malik Siah ” As stated therein, the place was deserted about 12 years ago, the reasons given me being ( 1 ) that the produce of the ground was insufficient to enable the inhabitants, who were compulsory tenants, to meet the exorbitant demands of the then Amir of Kain (Mir Alam Khan); (2) the inhabitants feared the marauding Baluchis who frequented the hills to the west of the village. I inspected the old karez which lies about £ mile from the now ruined fort. A little digging produced a strong flow of good water. The water of this karez used, 12 years ago, to run in an. open channel to irrigate a large area of ground to the north and east of the fort. The channel is now dry; but the Khatkhuda informed me that for Rs. 300 he would re-open the karez and “ bring the village to life again ”. He said that the present Governor of Kain would give us the place for nothino-. If not, he thought it would be easy for him to purchase the place outright at'a nominal sum, and that, with a little assistance, he could repopulate thei ► V 6 village in a very short time. He offered to send both his sons with their families as a start. It would, however, be advisable to consult the Shaukat- ul-Mulk at Birjand in this matter before taking any very serious steps with regard to the place. I understand that Major Trench, while at Birjand on his way to Meshed, broached the subject in conversation with the Shaukat-ubMulk, and that the latter was not only keenly alive to the import ance of opening up the new route, but also most anxious to assist us in every way. I am awaiting further information from Major Trench before giving the Aliabad Khatkhuda any definite instructions. Meanwhile the Khatkhuda is sending his son to the place to assist caravans, while he himself will remain at Aliabad to induce caravans to use the new route. He will also lay in a few supplies at Safidawa as well as here. As Madeh lies on the most direct caravan road from Meshed to Robat, from Birjand to Robat, and from Herat to Robat, its development will be an immense advantage to all caravans travelling between these places. If the place could once be brought under cultivation and restored even to its former prosperity, it would not only be able to support itself, but keep the next stage, Safidawa, provided with supplies. Camel grazing and firewood abound in the immediate vicinity of the fort. General direction of march—south-east. ( 2 ) Safidawa, 15 miles.— Vide Khan Bahadur Maula Bux’s report. [From this point the best route to the Shela river is that described by Khan Bahadur Maula Bux via Poghi and Sangar-i-Mir Alam Khan. But no water exists at either of these places, and I was assured that, if wells were dug, the water would be salty and undrinkable. Caravans, when forced to halt at either of these places, send to Mukh-i-Surkh (15 miles to the south-west) to fetch water for themselves. Camels have to do without water. I therefore decided upon an intermediate stage—called Chungi Shor by Baluchis and Gurg-i-Takht by Persians—between Poghi and Sangar-i-Mir Alam Khan. I was told that there would be every hope of the water turning out sweet if a well were dug here. Sardar Saiyid Khan, Muhammad Hussani, is now engaged in digging an experimental well. General direction of march—south-east. (3) Chungi Shor, 28 miles. The road avoids the irregular broken ground which lies at the foot of the slopes of the Palang Koh and runs over a level plain. At 19 miles is Poghi, where there is neither water nor firewood. Here there is both. As stated above, a well is under construction. General direction of march—south-east. (4) Gali Chah, 26 miles. Level road across an open plain and the Hamun. If the latter is in flood, the journey can be broken on its banks and a detour made the next day. If it is not in flood, the direct road leads south-east across the sandy bed of the Hamun. At Gali Chah are some disused wells, the water of which is said to be good. These are now being opened, and will be ready for use in a very short time, as the water lies close to the surface. Gali Chah is about 10 to 12 miles north-west of Girde Than a, from which place Sardar Saiyid Khan is now arranging to throw in a few supplies for the use of caravans. Plenty of firewood and camel grazing close at hand. (5) Ledhi Chah or Shela, 18 miles. This place is situated about 7 miles to the west of Nawar Thana, where one of our postal thanas on the Robat-Seistan line already exists. An experi mental well is being dug here, but I am told there is little hope of the water being sweet. In this case caravans could easily camp at Kawar Thana, which would take them but little out of their way. General direction of march—south. Prom this point the road joins the main route from Seistan to Koh-i-Malik Siah and Robat.The advantages claimed for the new route vid the Palang Koh are: — ( 1 ) It is 70 miles shorter than the old route. ( 2 ) It avoids the innumerable water channels which exist on the Seistan road. (3) It avoids the Seistan fly and other ills which are so detrimental to camels by the old route. (4) There is an abundance of camel grazing the whole way. (5) The customs oflicials in Seistan are in the habit of extorting heavy dues from caravans in excess of the recognised 5^ ad valorem duty, and, with the tacit support of the Russian Vice-Consul, molest them in other ways. By the new route, the possibility of such annoyances would be reduced to a minimum. Its sole disadvantage is or was its proximity to the hills and liability to the attacks of raiders. The latter, I understand, were generally either of Sardar Saiyid Khan’s own tribe or men over whom he had a certain amount of control. As Sardar Saiyid Khan now enjoys a fixed allowance of Rs. 100 a month from the Indian Government, it should not be difficult to ensure the safety of the road; while, if a small thana were built at Ledhi Chah and Safidawa, caravans could use the new route with the utmost confidence from end to end.

A. E. Benn, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul for Seistan and Kain for period ending nth April 1901. April 1st. —Nil. April 2nd .—The head Mirza of the Russian Vice-Consul’s Office visited Messrs. Muhammad Ali Brothers’ shop this morning and asked their Agent, Seth Suleiman, to change some Russian currency notes for krans. He suggested that the notes would be useful if the Seth wished to remit money to Meshed. The Seth replied he regretted he could not oblige him, and that if he wished to remit money to Meshed, he would prefer to do so through his own Consul who could issue barats. I mentioned in my last diary that the Russian Vice- Consul was somewhat at a loss to know how to furnish the newly arrived Armenian merchant with krans in lieu of the roubles which the latter is said to have deposited in Meshed, and there seems no doubt that the Mirza had been deputed to try and induce the Seth to he’p Mr. Miller through his difficulty. The Armenian merchant’s name is Michael Istatoroff, and I learn from the Meshed diary that he represents the firm of Messrs. Kurshad Manato Kanoff and Brothers of Askabad. I have not made his acquaintance yet as he has not been to call on me, although he is living with Mr. Miller as his guest. Mr. Miller has explained to me that the man is not generally recognised in society. Mons. Istatoroff does not appear to have done much in the way of trade so far. He still intends visiting the surrounding country. He has already been to Banjar, a village close to Nasratabad, where he tried to persuade the traders to visit Askabad , He offered to give them the same prices for their goods at Askabad as they could get in Quetta and asked them to buy Russian goods in Askabad through his firm. The head of the trading community in Banjar declined his offer saying that they knew nothing of him, the Russian language or Askabad, and that they were not prepared at present to venture in that direction. I under stand that he has been unable to make any purchase of wool and ghi yet. Five more Turcoman sowars have now joined him. They had been left behind on the road to buy wool and hides ; but I am informed that they were not successful. The mail from England dated London, 2nd March, arrived here to-day via Quetta. Thirty-two days from London to Seistan is perhaps worthy of record. April 3rd .—There is a rumour here that the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk has received a letter from either Teheran or Meshed censuring him strongly for hav ing “ allowed the English to obtain so much influence and such a foothold ” in Seistan. Also that he has received orders to “ expel all foreign traders.” I have not as yet been able to discover if there are any grounds for believing these rumours ; but the subject is being discussed in the Assembly of Mullahs and the story is confirmed by such leading men as Sardar Purdil Khan, Sarbandi, and Mir Abbas, Kalantar. The Amir himself has said nothing to me on the subject; but he appears much depressed of late. With regard to the first rumour, I am told that a short time ago the Russian Vice-Consul managed to induce some of the more influential people of Hussinabad—the village which overlooks the Fort of Nasratahad and in which the Russian Vice-Consulate is situated—to report to the Shah that “ the English had built a fort and a town opposite to and five times as large as Nasratabad itself.” In matters of this sort Mr. Miller does not stop at hyperbole. I need scarcely remark that the “ Fort ” exists only in Mr. Miller’s fertile brain, and that it would require a very wide stretch of imagina tion to magnify the temporary quarters, which Major Trench has built, into a “ town.” It is quite possible that Mr. Miller did induce the Hussinabad people to petition the Shah ; it would only have been in keeping with his policy if he had done so. He has given out that he now entirely ignores the Amir Hasmat- ul-Muik here and deals direct with Teheran and Meshed. Every black mark, therefore, that he can get registered against the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s name is only another nail—so to speak—in the Amir’s coffin, and Mr. Miller hopes by persistent tale-bearing and back-biting to bring about his ultimate removal from Seistan and the appointment of a less Anti-Russian2 Governor in his place. I now hear that an emissary from Meshed is expected here very shortly who is to report on the state of affairs and take the Amir back with him to Meshed. Mr. Miller's policy has had the effect of temporarily checking the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s friendliness towards us. He is too shrewd to openly defy the Russian, and he therefore occasionally finds it necessarv to appease him. He has, for instance, refused to allow Messrs. Mahomed Ali Brothers agent to continue building a house in the city which he had given him permission to begin, while he has forbidden the people of Nasratabad to attend our weekly gymkhana in Trenchabad. We need not, I think, anticipate any more serious obstruction than this, and we must bear in mind that the Amir’s position here !S a very difficult one. He finds himself in the dilemma of having to risk the Governorship on the one hand and the good-will and favour of the British, which he is anxious to keep, on the other. The Sarhang accompanied by Sardar Purdii Khan, Sarbandi returned my official visit of the 3 t S t March this morning. The Sarhang i may b&gt; noted, is about to marry Sardar Purdii Khan’s daughter.

Me®who were recognised as Russian servants were also sent round amon. our snectk ors to draw attention to the rival show; but 1 am glad to say without result P Not a man even left h,s place and the band retired to the city. I trus Jav be pardoned for recording so trmal an occurrence in an official diary - but thL inci dent affords a good example of the childish schemes Mr. Miller resorts to to’ be-httle my appointment here and damage our popularity. q ,, April Jth, Mons.

April gth. Sardar Sayad Khan, Muhammad Hussain^ who is in charge of the postal arrangements between Robat and Seistan, tells me that 5 Turcoman sowars came to his village a few days ago having been sent by the Armenian merchant to hire camels. They said they were going to buy sheep in the hills to the south of Seistan. Sardar Sayad Khan replied that he could not supply them with camels and warned them not to cross the border. The 1 urcomans have now returned here. The Sardar says he recognises them as the same min who came down to his village last year for the purpose of buying sheep. April loth. During Captain Webb Ware’s recent visit here he pointed out that the most direct route by the map to and from Birjand for caravans using the Nushki route seemed to be via the Palang Koh to Neh. A glance at the map will show that the present route via Seistan to Birjand traverses two sides of a triangle, while the newly proposed route traverses only one. Major Trench now writes to me to say that after enquiries he has made he finds that many caravans from Birjand and Herat are already in the habit of using this latter route, which is said to be much shorter and avoids the water channels of Seistan. The present moment seems to be an opportune one for me to make a short tour, and I propose to start at once to explore and report on the new route. My departure in the direction of Robat with a small escort will no doubt have the effect of putting a stop to Mens. Istatoroff’s project of visiting the neighbourhood of Koh-i-Malik Siah. I shall probably be absent from Nasratabad for about 10 days. April nth .—My Munshi,Gul Muhammad Khan,paid a visit to the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s Nazar this evening. The Nazar told him that the Russian Vice-Consul had succeeded in inducing the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk to sell him 10,000 krans for roubles, and that Mr. Miller had also arranged to get me specie from Birjand in his weekly post bag. Mons. Istatoroff sent for Sardar Sayad Khan, Muhammad Huss^i/fi), today and asked for his help in getting camels and supplies as he wished to visit the sarhadto buy sheep. Sayad Khan warned him against crossing the border and said he could not supply him with camels. Trade news. 1. The Agent of Messrs. Chaman Singh and Co., referred to in paragraph 18 of my Diary No. 1, has hired a large shop in the city and made considerable im provements to it. He expects his first caravan of Indigo and miscellaneous merch andise, about 70 camel loads in all, from India in a few days. He has meanwhile been buying up wool and ghi. 2. Messrs. Mahomed Ali Brothers inform we that their agent in Birjand has collected a large quantity of what is locally known as kandiliox export to India. This is a kind of pitch w’hich is much used for painting the outside of ships and is a very valuable commodity. The firm tell me that they can sell it in Karachi to a European firm there for nearly four times the price that it costs them to land it at the docks. 3 Sardar Sayad Khan, Muhammad Hussalyfi), informs me that a party of 400 Babars from Jhob have encamped near Koh-i-Ma$)k Siah and are collecting large quantities of assafeetida to take to India. They had bought large quantities of flour from his village.4. News from Birjand is that carrels continue to be very scarce and their rate of hire to Quetta has now been raised. This is said to have been arranged by the Russian Vice Consul from here and shows the new line he proposes to adopt to cripple our trade. The remedy lies in our using every endeavour to induce Quetta camelmen who happen to arrive here to continue their journey to Birjand and load their camels there. I have just heard that a caravan of 500 camels is on the point of starting from Neh with assafoetida and miscellaneous goods for Quetta. NASRATABAD; The nth April igoi. \ R. A. E.

The announcement of the demise of the Queen-Empress was received by my camp with the most profound grief. No one knew that Her Majesty’s state of health had given rise to apprehension, thus the sorrowful news came as terrible personal shock to each individual member of my camp. 3. My visit to Ladis, while: ostensibly to shoot, arose, in reality, from a wish to investigate Monsieur Zarudni, the Russian Naturalist’s doings. I have little to add to what 1 have already reported regarding this gentleman, except to say that a man, on whom I can rely, and who was in the “ scientists ” camp two davs, told me that Monsieur Zarudni’s interpreter said openly that the objective of the tour was an inspection of the Perso-Baluch Frontier. Monsieur Zarudni’s march down the frontier from Duzdap to Ladis and thence vtd the Reg-i-Malik to Jalk certainly gives a colour to this statement. 1 need scarcely say that the collection of reptiles, w'hich, it was said tw f o years ago, was Monsieur Zarudni’s speciality, offers very considerable difficulties in the depths of winter. When near Jalk Monsieur Zarudni met Rasid Khan, brother to Sirdar Mir Kya Khan, and presented him with a breech-loading rifle and ammunition. I would venture to point out that both Sirdar Mir Kya Khan and his brother are British subjects and reside on our side of the Mashkel Frontier. 4. Before leaving Mirjawa 1 had a careful survey of the Mirjaw'a District in a scale of one inch to the mile carried out. The work was done by Rai Sahib Atma Ram, Accountant in my office, a trained surveyor, to. whom my thanks are due. 5. On i^th Sartip Mir Masum Khan, eldest son of the Hashmat-ul- Mulk, Governor of Seistan, passed through Saindak on his w^ay to Quetta and Calcutta to consult an oculist. I had not met Mir Masum Khan for four years, that is to say, since the time of my first visit to Seistan in 1897. The estimate . &gt; I formed of the young man and his capabilities in 1897 was notX Mattering to him ; but, so far as l could judge, during the limited time Mir Masum Khan was with’me, he has decidedly improved. Mir Masum Khan has a very good opinion of himself, but this, no doubt, is due, in a large measure, to the struggle for his possession between Major Irench and Monsieur Miller. It should also be remem bered that Mir Masum Khan w’as called on to administer Seistan when he was a mere child. 16. Agha Muhammad’s Birjand Kafila of 284. camels also passed through Saindak during my halt. This trader was much perturbed, because l could not let him have 60 maunds of bhoosa daily for his camels. He told me, much to my surprise, that it was the custom of the Birjand camelmen to give their camels, in winter, bhoosa and not Ardawa. My five years’ experience of this country has satisfied me that bhoosa is a luxury, camels can well dispense with, but a moderate daily allowance of Ardawa* • 3 of a maund of Ardawa suffices for the needs is CSSCntial. Without Ardawa Camels fall of camel between Killa Robat and Quetta. Arda* ^ . j. . • . • . i wa is always kept stored in Thanahs. OIT in Condition, 111 Winter, in the most surprising way. It did not take me long to bring Agha Muhammad over to my way of thinking and I left him happy. 7. The Thanadar N^erui reports that some Seistanis forming part of a Kafila which was passing through Merui set on two of his sowars and beat them. I have not received full particulars of the fracas, but the incident is one to which I attach little importance. 8. Small-pox has appeared in the Mirjawa District. 9. It is evident, in many ways, that the interest which has been directed during the past year towards Nushki-Seistan caravan route is rapidly quickening into action. Scarcely a mail passes without inquiries reaching me from traders, wishing to embark in trade with Persia. I think I noted in a previous diary that the agent of a Shikarpur firm, said to command five lakhs of capital, accom panies me to Seistan. This is one of the fruits of my recent visit to Shikarpur. I am in communication with several other firms, and on my return to Quetta I hope to despatch the representatives of one or tw r o more to Seistan. 10. A party of 60 Shiah pilgrims reached Killa Robat from Quetta on the 15th February 1901. 11. Lord A. Cecil, the Horse and Mule Breeding Commission Expert, writes to me in high praise of the Meshed remounts he has inspected. He says that, in his opinion, many are quite up to the standard required for British Cavalry. I think that no one will question Lord Cecil’s right to pronounce an opinion on this subject. 12. The Secretary of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce writes to announce 'my election as an Honorary Member of their Chamber. This is gratifying to me, as it shows that the influence of the Quetta-Seistan trade route is permeating Karachi commercial circles. 2 G. C. Pres., Simla.-No. 1326, F.

Diary of the Political Assistant, Chagai, for the week ending 8tH March 1901. ist to 8th.—Halt at Nasratabad, Sistan. 2. I paid my official visit to the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk on the 2nd ; and he returned the call a day or so later. The Amir was very pleasant and friendly. 3. On the 3rd I called on Mr. Miller, the Russian Vice-Consul, and was introduced by him to his brother and sister-in-law. The brother Dr. Miller, a dirty looking little man of about 32 began life, so he told me as a Medical cadet in the Russian Navy. From what I gather Dr. Miller’s chief duty consists in copying his brother’s letters. I understand that Mr. Miller proposes opening a d’spensary in Hussainabad. Should he do so the success of the institution is problematical, as Dr. Miller knows no Persian and his professional knowledge is superficial in the extreme. 4. Muhamm id Ali Brothers are doing very well. I have had a series of interesting conversations wuth the head of the firm, Seth Suleiman, who lives here. The following items of information are derived from him The firm has now opened shops in Nasratabad, Birjand and Tabas and they propose opening a branch in Meshed at no very distant date. I The Governor of Herat is pressing them to open at Herat, but they are right ly diffident in accepting this invitation. Mr. Miller is very solicitous that the firm shall not open in Meshed. He maintains that if they do, they will lose money and probably be ruined. This advice is significant as it is only a year ago that the Russian Vice Consul ex hausted every argument, he could think of, to induce them to leave Sistan and go to Meshed holding out the bait that the profits, to be realized in Northern Khorassan, were exceedingly handsome and that he would help them in every way. The purchases made by the firm in Southern Khorassan during the last six months amount in value to over lakhs. While I am naturally gratified at the success which has attended the estab- I lishment of the first Indian firm in Sistan, I am especially so because it shows that the lines, on which Muhammad Ali by my advice started business, are the true lines on which all business transactions in Persia must be conducted if they are to prove a success, and, so far as I am aware, these lines have never been tested before. It has become the fashion to suppose that a demand exists in Persia for only a few goods such as tea, indigo, sheeting, long-cloth, muslin, Turkey reds,' miscellaneous piece goods, copper sheets, ^!hina basins, India drugs, coffee, and coloured glass panes. This is a very great error. There is not a single manu factured article, which I can call to mind, of which the Persians do not stand inISe/r heed. They are anxious to buy everything from tinned salmon to ostrich feathe r fans, from 'ladies kid boots to bicycles, from cigarettes to iron bedsteads, from children’s toys to mincing machines and what they only require is to be given the opportunity of doing so which has hitherto been denied them. The Persian/ differ/from the native^ of India in that he insists on a thoroughly good article, worships novelty, and is comparatively indifferent to the price he pays so long as he can satisfy his bent. I will give an example in illustration of what ^ I mean. Up to recently the Persians of Southern Khorassan used exclusively “ hinna ” which is grown in large quantities in the Kirman district of Narniashir and is ex ceedingly cheap. Now that Amritsar “ hinna” is available they insist on buying this. The cause of this being that the Amritsar ” hinna ” is better prepared, more carefully ground and is all round a far superior article. I wonder if it has ever occurred to any Anglo-Indian merchant that Indian grown ' hinna ” can compete successfully with that grown in Persia. The demand for “ hinna ” appears to be very fair. Seth Suleiman tells me that he sold off the 'whole of the last consignment he received from Quetta, some 15 camels in all, two days before it reached Birjand. And so it is the whole way through. Good English cloth, silks, cutlery, watches, gold embroidery, broad cloth, baizes, muslin, wTiting paper, candles, scents, glass, crockery, iron beds, iron ware of every sort, b.an- kets, rugs, chintzs, Turkey caps, everything in short one can think of, not even excluding such articles as furniture, enamelled ware, a^ceteline lamps, aluminum cups, fancy ornaments and fancy hanging lamps, pepper,, snuff, limejuice, saddlery, chatneys, mirrors, and tools of every sort, musical instruments, etc., etc. As I have said the native of India requires a cheap article and is con sequently satisfied with one of inferior quality, the Persian, on the other hand, is determined to have the very best and he does not mind paying a price so long as the quality satisfies him. English made goods, no matter what, have the highest reputation in Persia and are therefore the most sought after and it is only because English goods of high quality are not procurable, that Russian manufac tures, for which all Persians, 1 have hitherto met, profess the most utter contempt* are purchased. It is in my opinion a great mistake to suppose that because the Russian Railway system is connected with Meshed by a road, that the markets of Northern Persia are closed to us. The Russians can only manufacture very few' of the articles the Persians require, we, on the other hand, can manufacture everything. Given cheap carriage between Quetta and Sistan, I believe firmly that Russian manufactures would be ousted from most of the bazars of Northern Persia. Muhammad Ali tefis me that Mr. Miller’s native Persian establishment in place of remitting their pay to Meshed frequently purchase English made goods from him and forward these to Meshed to be disposed of by their relations, in the bazar there, at a profit, and he also tells me that he frequently receives orders for goods from Meshed itself. 5. Shah Sowar, late Kotwal of Kandahar, w 7 ho is referred to in the Kandahar News-letter No. 2, dated the nth January 1901, paid me a visit a few days ago. He is a garrulous inquisitive old man with a great flow of questionable language. He appears to take life joyfully in spite of the misfortunes which have overtaken him in his old age. 6. Now that the Rukn-ud-dowla, Governor-General of Khorassan, is dead ; there is a very general idea abroad in Sistan that the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk will shortly be reinstated in Tabas indeed, some people go so far as to say that the Amir returns to Tabas shortly after the Nauroz. 1 he Hashmat-ul-Mulk attri butes the loss of the Deputy Governorship of Tabas to the en^mity of the Rukn- ud-dowla, with w'hom he has long been on bad terms. It is said that when the Hashmat-ul-Mulk received the new T s of the Wali’s death he joyfully exclaimed that it was very best news he had received -feem many a year. 7. Major Trench has introduced me to Muhammad Akbar the Moawin-ul- tajarat, Meshed Agent. Muhammad Akbar is so enthusiastic on the prospects of the new trade route, that it is quite a pleasure to listen to^ him. I was glad to hear tnat the price in Meshed for tea exported by land via the Quetta and Sistan route is higher than that fetched by the tea exported v'u the Bandar Abbas route. G. C. Press, Sim’a. — No. 67 F. D. —17-4-01.—20.Diary No. 5 of Captain R. A. E. Bonn, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Seistan and Kain, for period ending 31st March 1901. 1. My last diary, dated 16 th February, brought the account of my journey to Seistan to a close and gave a description of my arrival in Nasratabad on 15 th February. From that date Major Chenevix-Trench continued to furnish the diary, the last of which brought the record of local events up to the date of his departure for Meshed on 20th March 1901 . 2. It will not, I trust, he out of place if I preface my first diary from Seistan with a few remarks on the trade route over which I have now travelled for the second time, and also briefly record the position of affairs as I found them when the charge of the Vice-Consulate came into my hands. 3 . Nearly a year has elapsed since I travelled over the Nushki-Seistan route. Considerable improvements have taken place since then, notably the erection of rest-houses which now either actually exist or are in process of construction at almost every halting place. I found comfortable quarters fit for occupation, with large and lofty rooms and a complement of out-liouses and stables at 9 out of the 24 stages between Quetta and Robat; at 5 the bungalows are practically finished and the remainder are in their initial stage. Everywhere there is a shelter of sorts for caravans in which my servants and escort always found good accommodation. The bungalows at present have no furniture; but this is promised. 'Where the water was bad or insufficient, new wells have been dug. At Saindak, where the water has a bad reputation, an apparatus for distilling water on a large scale was being worked in the thana with success. New shops have been opened in places, and arrangements are in progress for the erection of flour-grinding mills—to be worked by bullocks—at four 'places between Robat and Dalbandin. As regards the roadway itself, in spite of the very severe floods of the past winter, the damage done seemed to me to be surprisingly small. Here and there water channels had been deepened, the banks of nullas had been rendered abrupt, and stones and boulders were scattered over the track; but there was nothing that a party of Hazara coolies could not repair in a very short time. The only serious drawback which is caused by floods, but which could be depended on to right itself on the return of dry weather, is the nature of the soil on portions of the road between Nushki and Karodak a distance of about 100 miles. This bit, as I found it, after heavy rain, is practically impassable for camels; but it is always possible to avoid the bad bits by making a detour among the hills. Caravans, however, never seem to complain so much about this portion of the road as the bit between Nushki and Quetta. The latter they look on most unfavourably, as the cold and scanty grazing in the winter generally prove fatal to their camels. What they ask for is a kutcha road which would enable them to transport their goods by bullock-carts to Quetta and leave their camels to graze in Nushki. As I mentioned in a previous diary, 1 brought a Punjab ekka with me as an experiment. I had to carry it on camel back from Quetta to Nushki owing to the hills; but I managed to drive it successfully from Nushki to Nasratabad, except for two marches between Robat and Seistan where deep water channels exist. The road, therefore, from Nushki may be considered as adapted for wheeled traffic. As regards supplies along the road, I and my party suffered no incon venience whatever; but I would venture to suggest *that it will soon become necessary to establish godowns for reserve supplies at every stage. At present there is no fear of sufficient supplies not being procurable at all the main halting places and at the smaller ones also, provided the local authorities have been duly warned ; but I am anticipating the time when the flow of caravans will have to be reckoned with daily, when the comfort of respectable European2 traders accustomed to the luxuries of trunk roads in India will have to he studied, and when the route will be asked to bear a strain which I do not think it is now capable of supporting. For stages where no supplies are now stored, it is necessary to carry food for man and beast from the last halting place where there was a shop. This necessitates a supply of spare camels in addition to those already carrying loads; and this the average caravan or a single traveller who has not been warned does not generally come provided with. Nor, I believe, are camels obtainable on hire along the road. What seems to be required is the establishment of small shops for immediate wants and large godowns for reserve supplies at every stage, and, if possible, the individual attention of an additional officer to supervise these arrangements, and to ensure that the requisite amount of supplies is always maintained. I have experienced much inconvenience both on the road and since my arrival here from the postal arrangements. Not only is the letter post irregular, but the contents of the bag are often so battered about as to render the addresses on envelopes undecipherable, while the letters themselves often arrive without any cover at all. This is due to the fact that heavy parcels— tin boxes, &amp;c.—have to travel in the same bag as the letters. In the case of official or confidential letters this might prove a serious matter, and I would venture to put forward, for favourable considerations, the suggestion already made in a previous diary regarding the establishment of a separate parcels post to be carried on riding camels. 4 . The position of affairs, as I found them, may be summed up in a very few words. It is a position on which I venture to say we may congratulate ourselves. The local feeling predominates almost entirely in our favour, and is passively anti-Russian. The departure of the Sartip, Mir Masum Khan, for Quetta instead of Moscow was regarded as a serious blow to Russian prestige, and was the signal for the few waverers in the enemy’s camp to join our ranks. Our next move is now awaited with considerable interest by officials and people alike. They are watching to see how we intend following up the success we have gained. The Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, the head Mulla and the people are now all on our side. Even during the short time I have been here each and all of the above have—by what might seem insignificant actions—testified to their preference for British rather than Russian friendship. I will quote some instances. On the Nauroz, or festival of the new year, when it is cus tomary to pay official visits of congratulation on the local Governor, the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk gave me the seniority and received me in open Darbar before the Russian Vice-Consul; the latter had to wait until my interview was over. The head Mulla, who has been seriously ill, rejected the treatment of Dr. Miller, the Russian doctor, in preference to some English medicines which happened to be in our hospital. The best proof that the people also are with us is the fact that we have no difficulty whatever in getting supplies. One corner of what is now widely known as Trenchabad is daily converted into a small bazaar where food and forage find ready purchasers. On festival days the place is crowded, while on cricket and football evenings the Seistani may be seen joining in with the Hindustani. No one is forbidden access to the British Vice-Consul or to Trenchabad; beggars receive food or alms, and a meal is always ready for any traveller who cares to visit us. Mr. Miller plays the role of a somewhat dangerous obstructionist against us, and he descends to the lowest and often most childish schemes to effect his purpose. With the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk his policy has been one of steady intimidation in which he is strongly supported from Meshed. He has not been slow to use his powers in this respect at the present juncture—'which he regards as a change of horses in mid-stream—to prejudice the Amir Hashmat- ul-Mulk against me. Since Major Trench’s departure, he has been endeavour ing to re-establish himself in favour by giving presents in all directions and spreading false reports regarding my position here. I am told that he has already given oul Trench having be as was given to n new Vice-Consul; Up to now I hi Hashmat-ul-Mull But althougt are not yet in f dangerous enemy Meshed which h should be in a be1 The above i object not only to to develop and tu 5 .

But although at present we hold the vantage ground against our rival, we re no yet in full possession of the field. Mr. Miller must always remain a dangerous enemy as long as he can command that power of intimidation from Meshed winch he wields so skilfully. If that power could be crippled, we should be in a better position to push home our victory here. The above is, in brief, the present state of local affairs. It will he my object not only to maintain them in this satisfactory state, but also, if possible, to develop and turn them to the best account. 5 . March 30 th, 1901 .—Major Trench left Nasratabad.

March 22 nd. I paid an official visit of congratulation on the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Sarhang in the evening. The Amir received my visit before that of the Russian Vice-Consul. The Sarhang did the same. Ihe Russian Vice-Consul, Dr Miller, and his wife dined with me in the evening. Mr. Miller constantly talks of trying to get some leave, now that his brother, Dr. Miller, has arrived. . March 23 rd. Mr. Miller has completed the dispensary for his brother. It is a small two-roomed building, almost adjoining his house and on the edge of the local grave-yard. Dr. Miller is said to have about 20 patients daily; but he is not popular. He cannot speak a word of Persian, he has a most un- prepo^essing appearance which has earned for him most uncomplimentary nicknames, and his manners irritate and are distasteful to the people. I received a visit from the head Mulla’s brother. He had been sent to thank me for a letter I addressed to the head Mulla enquiring after his health. March 24 th.—T \iq Sarhang returned my visit of congratulation in the evening. I paid an official visit of congratulation to the Karguzar. March 25 th. The Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk returned my official visit this morning. After the Amir’s visit _ I paid a visit to the head Mulla, Haii Ismail. The old man, who is very infirm and weak, expressed his sarisfaction at all we were doing to civilise the people of Seistan. I enjoyed a most interesting and instructive conversation with him. ° March 26 th. — Nil. March 27 th. —Mr. Miller and the Russian party were unable to accept my invitation to dinner owing to Mr. Miller, who acts as interpreter, being indisposed. Dr. and Mrs. Miller speak no language but their own. There is a rumour that two officials are being sent here from Meshed. One is to extract the balance of revenue still owed by the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk which the last emissary failed to realise; and the other is to inspect the troops and report whether the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk maintains them at their proper strength. March 28 th. —The Karguzar returned my official visit. Some members of the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s family are ill and are being attended by Hospital Assistant Abbas Ali. 31 arch 29 th .—An Armenian merchant, said to be a representative of a Russian firm in Ashkabad, has arrived here and is staying with the Russian Vice- Consul. He speaks only a little Persian, but talks Turki well. He is accom panied by two Turkoman sowars. I have not as yet had much opportunity of4 obtaining definite information about him; but he has apparently got no mer chandise or money with him. It is said that he has deposited a large amount of roubles in the Russian Consulate at Meshed, and hopes to receive its equivalent in krans from Mr. Miller here. He proposes to buy wool, hides and old coins, xor this purpose and with a view to testing the extent and possibilities of the trade m Seistan, he will visit the surrounding country, going even as far as Miljau a via Robat. As he may have orders to collect information regardin°* our border in his pursuit after merchandise and antiquities, I have warned Captain Webb Ware, who is still on the road. As regards the possibilities of Ins obtaining money here, Mr. Miller has very few krans at his disposal. He has Russian gold and notes which he has more than once asked Seth Suleiman y the representative of Messrs. Muhammad Ali Brothers, to change for him. The Seth however, refuses to oblige him. Nor is it probable that either he or the merchant will be able to issue barats (native money orders) on Meshed. Mr. Miller s last attempt to issue a barat from here was not a success, as it was not honoured at the other end ; and the merchant not being a Government official, it is probable that local traders will think twice before risking their monev in his hands. It is possible that matters may be arranged for him in Meshed. The merchant’s roubles may be paid to the Wall of Meshed on behalf of the Amir of Seistan who still owes a large amount of revenue to the Wali and the Amir will be called upon to pay Mr. Miller the equivalent in krans. ’ But the Amir is as usual very hard pressed for money, and it would be a long ime betore he could raise so large a sum. Even if the merchant does succeed in getting money here, the general opinion seems to be that he could not compete with success against the British firm here. Messrs. Muhammad Ali Brothers are already first in the field for this season crop of wool, and I have arranged for Seth Suleiman to make a tour of all the villages with a view to his buying more wool before the Russian merchant has time to look round. Ihe season, however, for buying wool is now nearly over, and in a month’s time when all the sheep-owners go to the hills there will be none. March 30 th—It is said that Mr. Miller is going to build a large caravan serai near the ISasratabad Fort which is to combine the duties of a traveller’s rest-house and a customs godown. The Customs officer, Mons. Spinella, who is expected here shortly, as well as the Russian merchant, will be given quarters in the caravanserai. ^ March 31 st. To-day being the Id-i-Kurban and the biggest religious festival in the year I paid official visits to the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the harming. Irenchabad was full of visitors, and our mosque was largely attended in tlie morning. After prayers tea was served to all visitors who had come to the mosque. frade news.-There is a dearth of camels in Birjand at present, though tradera are prepared to start off merchandise to Quetta. I shall try and induce Quetta camelmen on their arrival here to go to Birjand. Their influence and knowledge of the road ought to have a very good result. Manv traders in Birjand have been waiting for the return of one Hussain Gevi'who was the first to take a small Birjand kafila through to Quetta bv the Nushki route. Hussain Gevi has now reached Birjand, and Seth Suleiman’s agent there informs me that Hussain Gevi has reported very well on the road and is encouraging others to patronise the route. Messrs. Muhammad Ali Brothers in Quetta, have advanced sums of money, amounting to over 4,000 krans, to Seistani traders who ran short of money there, and have thus enabled them to complete their purchases and bring back their camels fully laden.

I arrived at Pusht-i-Dasht to find Sirdar Purdil Khan Sarbandi, the pre- iflier Sirdar of Sistan, awaiting to pay his respects to me. As we are likely to hear a great deal about this Sirdar later on, I trust that the following may prove 0 f some interest:— The late Mir Alam Khan, Amir of Kain,* left three sons, viz. } Ali Akbar Khan, * I adopt the spelling commonly used although ^ ho has issue, Sartip. Mir Masum Khan, it is incorrect. In Persian this place is spelt by a Baluch lady, sister tO Sirdar Syed ^:S^'he^hSriwr thiSOn ^ han N*™. and Sarhang Muhammad Raza Khan, by a temporary wife,f termed in Persia a “Sigha”; Mir Ismail Khan, who has no issue, and Mir Ibrahim Khan. t This wow^n is now married to a shoemaker In accordance with the policy followed SO who lives in the Tabas Bazar. successfully by the late Shah, whose aim it was to divide up the power, the semi-independent frontier princes of Persia enjoyed, on Sirdar Alam Khan’s demise, the Governorship of Sistan, the richest portion of Amir Alam Khan’s principality, was conferred on his eldest son, Ali Akbar Khan, with the title of Hashmat-ul-Mulk, Mir Ismail Khan was given Birjand and Kain, with the title of Shaukat-ul-Mulk, while Mir Ibrahim Khan, who was a child at the time, received nothing, but the empty title of Sartip. For several years the Hashmat-ul-Mulk lived in Sistan and administered the country himself, but a handsome donceur having induced the Wali to confer the Governorship of Tabas on him, Mir Ali Akbar Khan took up his residence at Tabas. The decision to make Tabas his head-quarters was no doubt largely due to the influence of his youngest wife, who is sister to the Imad-ul-Mulk, Cover, nor of Tabas, the official he supplanted. To administer Sistan Ali Akbar Khan despatched his son and legitimate heir, Sartip Mir Masum Khan, thither, placing him under the guardianship of his brother-in-law Sirdar Syed Khan Narui. To be brief it will suffice to say that this arrangement did not prove very successful. The Narui are not a tribe of any very great standing in Sistan, consequently many Sistanis resented a petty Sirdar, like Syed Khan, being placed in supreme authority over them, and before long feeling ran high. Head of the malcontents was _Sirdar. ^P.urdil Khan Sarbandi, the most influential Chief in Sistan. Truth compelTme to sayTharTKis^iSTOTP'''- tent was not without cause, for Sirdar Syed Khan made the most of his oppor tunities to better the position of his relations at the expenses of others. So many Ik I fycomplaints reached Tabasthat eventually the Hashmat ul*Mulk wrote to his son and ordered him to dismiss Syed Khan forthwith. This Mir Masum Khan, who is warmly attached to his uncle and quite under his influence, stoutly refused to do. Finding expostulations useless the Hashmat-ul-Mulk then decided to replace the Sartip in the Governorship of Sistan by his second son, Sarhang Muhammad Raza Khan, whom he accordingly despatched to Sistan for this pur pose. Sartip Mir Masum Khan declined to surrender the reins of Government to Muhammad Raza Khan, and for a time a conflict between the two brothers seemed imminent. Finally Sirdar Purdil Khan, under instructions from the Hashmat-ul*Mulk, assembled his men with the intention of attacking Sirdar Syed Khan. Sirdar Syed Khan very wisely, however, did not wait to be attacked but fled across the border into Afghanistan. On this Sartip Mir Masum Khan handed Nasratabad fort over to his brother and retired to Birjand. For a year Sarhang Muhammad Raza Khan administered the country successfully. This was due not so much to any particular ability he possesses, as to the council and assis tance he received from Sirdar Purdil Khan, to whose daughter he is betrothed. Early last year the Hashmat-ul-Mulk was deprived of the Governorship of Tabas and retired to Sistan, where he was joined a few months later by his eldest son. It is scarcely necessary for me to narrate the events of the last few months as they are described in Maj(T Trench’s diaries. The outlook in Sistan, in so far as Sirdar Purdil Khan and Mir Masum Khan are concerned, may thus be summed up as follows. Sartip Mir Masum Khan, provided his eyesight does not fail, will, there is every reason to believe, not only succeed his father as Governor of Sistan. but very probably inherit from his uncle the Governorship of Birjand and Kain. The Sartip entertains the warmest regard for his uncle, Sardar Syed Khan ; thus there is no doubt whatever that he is only waiting for a favourable opportunity to recall the Sirdar. To do this will bring him into immediate conflict with Sirdar Purdil Khan, who will never consent to play second fiddle to Sirdar Syed Khan, a man he despises. It is only natural to anticipate that a struggle will then ensue, Sirdar Purdil Khan supporting his son-in-law, Sarhang Muhammad Raza Khan, whom he wishes to see instated as Governor of Sistan 1 he Hash- mat ul-Mulk ascribes all the trouble he had with Sistan during Sariip Mir Masum Khan’s Deputy Governorship to Sardar Syed Khan’s intrigues, and refuses to allow the Sirdar’s return to Sistan, on any pretence whatever. The future pre sents many difficulties. We cannot well afford to ignore Sardar Syed Khan, as doing so would naturally drive him into the arms of the Russians whose overture he has only declined because both Mir Masum Khan and the Hashmat-ul-Mulk heartily distrust them. I need scarcely say that should the Russians be permit ted to gain an ascendency over Siidar Syed Khan, there is a strong presumption that Sartip Mir Masum Khan will also fall, later on under the same influence. On the other hand, to do anything in Sistan for Sirdar Syed Khan would be resented by the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and go far towards alienating the friendship of Sirdar Purdil Khan, who is the most influential Sirdar in Sistan and cur most devoted partisan. 1 think that the wisest course for us to adopt would be to invite Sirdar Syed Khan to settle in Quetta and give him a pension. By acting thus we would remove a discordant note from Sistan politics, earn the gratitude of the Amir Hashmat-ul-Mulk, of Sardar Purdil Khan and of Sartip Mir Masum Khan and prevent the Russians gaining an ascendancy over Syed Khan. When I left Sistan the political position there was as follows. The bearing of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk towards Major Trench throughout the past year has been so pronouncedly friendly, while on the other hand his bearing towards Mr. Miller has been so cavalier that there is no doubt now to which side his personal feelings incline. Having been foiled by Major Trench in every attempt he has made to win the Hashmat-ul-Mulk over to his side, Mr. Miller has now adopted aggressive tactics of an essentially Russian type. Through the medium of the Russian Consul-General, Meshed, the Wali has been moved to make demands on the Hashmat-ul-Mulk for large sums in cash. As I write a M-'trnur is on his way to Sistan to extort 10,000 tomans. It does not need muchintuition to perceive Mr. Miller’s aim. The Russian Vice-Consul foresees that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk will apply to us for pecuniary assistance, and he equally foresees that it will be refused him. It is obviously quite impossible for us to advance the Hashmat-ul-Mulk money to meet every demand the Wali may see fit to make on him. Refused help by us, Mr. Miller anticipates, and no doubt rightly, that the Hashmat-ul Mulk will eventually be driven to seek his assistance. To reduce the Hashmat-ul-Mulk to a complete state of subjection and then win his eternal gratitude by arranging the recall of the Mamur are steps neither of which offer any great difficulty to such an astute man as Mr. Miller. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk is a Persian and like all Persians is weak to a degree. From what I have said 1 think it is clear that the time has come when we must either give the Hashmat- ul-Mulk the support he requires or suffer him and with him Sistan and Southern Khorassan to fall under an influence which is directly hostile to the trade route. While I neither know what our future policy towards Sistan is to be, nor presume to lay it down, yet I would venture to point out that if the Government of India is determined, as 1 understand is the case, to keep our influence in Sistan predomi nant, it will be necessary to take early steps to assure the Hashmat-ul-Mulk of our sympathy and support. If I might be permitted to suggest how this can be done, I would propose that some Indian decoration be conferred on the Hashmat- ul-Mulk, and that tactics, similar to those pursued by the Russians to prevent their friend and ally the ilkani of Kuchan being periodically squeezed by the Wali, be adopted through the medium of our Legation at Tehran. What I have stated are facts and not conjectures. Mr. Miller is so confident of winning that he has had the assurance to boast that he will have the Hashmat-ul-Mulk on his knees before very long. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk is certainly in a very tight corner. 3. I have received news from Mashkel that Sartip Mir Hashim Khan, Deputy Governor of Bampur, was attacked by the Bamani, while on his way to Jalk to collect some revenues, which was outstanding and compelled to take refuge in a fort. It is reported that Mir Hashim Khan has sent messengers to Kirman urging the Governor to despatch a relief force to his rescue. From the intelligence which reaches me from time to time it would appear that the Persian Government have very little real control over the outlying portions of Persian Baluchistan. Emeutes, such as I describe, occur with persistent regularity every year. 4. It is said that Sirdar Nauroz Khan proposes dismantling Nauroz Khan Kalat and building another fort, twenty miles away, at a place named Kamarani Joi. I am also told that this much-married Sirdar goes to Mekran very shortly to espouse the daughter of Sirdar Shahbaz Khan of Jeberi. 5. I have received a letter from Sartip Mir Masum Khan announcing his safe arrival in Quetta on the 7th March 1901 and thanking me for the arrange ments made for his journey through the district. The only difficulty Mir Masum Khan would appear to have experienced, on the road, was the w r ant of bhoosa at some stages. As several travellers have expressed surprise that bhoosa is not forthcoming at every stage, I would again point out that to do this would involve sending bhoosa on camels, at a cost in carriage quite prohibitive, from either Sistan or Nushki. Between Quetta and Dalbandin and again between Sistan and Saindak bhoosa is to be had at nearly every stage, while at Merui, Taratoh and Mashki Chah sufficient grass is always kept stored. It will thus be seen that travellers can always obtain fodder for their horses if they are prepared to carry it for a day or so at a time. In Garmsel evey year thousands of maunds of bhoosa are left to rot on the ground. His Highness the Amir has not, so far as I am aware, forbidden the export of fodder, but the Baluch of Garmsel are afraid that they will get into trouble if they send it out of the country, and naturally the price bhoosa commands offers them no inducement to smuggle. 6. In previous diaries I have alluded to the embargo placed on the export of wheat from Garmsel by order of His Highness the Amir. The following infor mation derived from a Garmsel Kat Khuda, named Mirak, whom I met at Killa Robat, may prove of interest. It appears that whereas the Amir has always been strongly opposed to wheat leaving Afghanistan, in the case of Garmsel no actual orders were ever 3issued on the subject prior to July 1900, or if they were issued no steps were ever taken to enforce them. The amount of wheat in Garmsel has always largely exceeded the local demand ; it is thus possible that this, combined with the fact that the position of Garmsel is geographically such as to render it difficult, if not impossible, to send any of the surplus wheat to other parts of Afghanistan, accounts for the Amir’s orders having become, if they were ever issued, a dead letter. It has been the practice of the Nomad population of the Chagai, Kharan, Mashkel, Sarhad and districts lying around to draw on Garmsel for the difference between the wheat they grow and their requirements. The natural result of this, greatly accentuated by the famine of the last six years, is that a large number of the Garmsel Zamindars—some say as many as half—look to the districts, I name, to take their surplus grain every year. In July 1900 strict orders reached Garm sel from Kabul that no wheat was to be allowed to pass out of the country. For the reasons given, the shoe began to pinch at once. Deprived of their market, the Kat Khudas of Garmsel addressed a joint petition to the Akhundzada, Gov ernor of Kung, in which they pointed out that if the orders transmitted to them were enforced, the result could only be to throw a large amount of land in Garmsel out of cultivation. The truth of what the Kat Khudas represented was quickly brought home to the Akhundzada. The Kat Khudas having no money to pay their taxes offered him grain instead. Grain being a drug in the market, the Akhundzada declined to accept it in lieu of money. Failing to raise money to satisfy the demands made on him from Kabul, it w^ould appear that the Akhundzada took it on himself to relax the orders he had received ; at least this is the only way 1 can explain away the fact that between the months of November 1900 and January 1901 large quantities of grain were allotved to leave the country. News of this reaching Farah, further orders were sent down prohibit ing the export of grain under the severest penalties. I gather from my information that the inhabitants of Garmsel are growing very discontented, although they have been deprived of their chief market the demands made on them have not been lessened. Both Kat Khudas and Zamindars have large stocks of grain in hand for which they can find no buyers. I am led to believe that the Akhund zada has addressed a petition to the Amir pointing out that a serious falling off in the revenue realized from Garmsel must ensue unless the orders prohibiting the export of wheat are rescinded. It w r ill be interesting to watch the course of events in Garmsel. I am told that the Akhundzada is confident that the Amir will rescind his orders, but I am inclined to doubt this myself. In spite of the various precautions which are taken to prevent smuggling a certain amount of grain will always find its way out of the country. This is not surprising, for, firstly, the frontier is an open one ; secondly, large numbers of the Garmsel Baluch are closely related to the Nomad Baluch who live south of the frontier ; and, lastly, it is obviously to the advantage of •Kat Khuda has just sent 100 maunds of wheat to every individual Kat* Khuda in Garmsel Samdak. y to connive at smuggling. From the same informant I gathered the following information. The population of Garmsel, said to number 240,000, is divided into innumer able tribes, sections and families. In point of numbers the most important tribes, in their order of precedence, are the Sinjerani, the Notani, the Kashani, the Gurgej and the Mamasani, all of which are Baluch. Garmsel is governed by a Deputy Governor who is know as the Akhundzada and resides all the year round at Killa Kung in Afghan-Sistan. The Akhundzada’s deputy in Garmsel is Sirdar Muhammad Raza Khan Sinjerani. Garmsel is said to contain 200 villages with and average of 400 houses in each. The sources from whence revenue is derived are as follow's. Quarter of the gross produce of the land, a tirni at the rate of one kran for every five sheep or goats and two krans for each cow and camel. In addition to the above a fee of 12 or 22 krans is levied on marriages, the amount depending on whether the bride is a widow or spinster. Each village has its own Kat Khuda who is responsible for the collection of revenue and the execution of all orders received from the Akhundzada. In conclusion my infor mant told me that Garmsel is watered by upwards of 200 irrigation canals 4us) ♦ This estimate appears high. I doubt whether varying in length from 5 to 14 miles, and the revere deriyed from Garmsei exceeds that each canal is calculated to yield an average revenue of 12,000* krans annually. 7 * 1 f ear that Sistan is destined to suffer this year severely from the ravages of locusts. Between Pusht-i-Dasht and Koh-i-Malik Siah, a distance of 80 miles, I marched through, what was to all intents onecdtinuous swarm of these pests engaged in depositing their eggs in the ground. In my diary for the week ending 24th January 1901, I noted having seen a swarm of locusts near Merui. It will indeed be a misfortune if this season, which promises to be the best the Chagai district has seen for years, is marred by incursions of locusts. 8. I have received a letter from the Tahsildar, Nushki, informing me that he has carried out my instructions and repaired the bunds across the upper dak lands. From the Tahsildar’s reports it would appear that the district crops promise ex ceptionally well this year. Excellent rain fell on the 10th instant, just at the time it is calculated to do most good. 9. I have received a letter from Mir Jahind Khan, the Damani Chief, in which he expresses a wish to see me. This is not the first letter I have received from Jahind, for when I was on my way to Sistan he wrote to me saying that if I re quired the services of any men he would gladly send mean escort of fifty jumbaz sowars I did not think it advisable to take advantage of this offer as only a few weeks before Jahind wrote he had been severely wounded in an attack on Mekran. I propose allowing Jahind to come in and see me, and if he does, l will rate him soundly for his folly. From what I have learnt Sirdar Jahind is not nearly so much to blame for joining in the raid on Mekran as is generally supposed. 10. Muhammad Umar Khan Nausherwani has been attacked by small-pox. 5 G. C. Press, Simla.—No. 142 F.
