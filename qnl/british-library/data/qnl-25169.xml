Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 5, 5*10 p.m.) Tehran, November 5, 1912. (No. 580.) (November 5, 5 p.m.) ACTING consul at Shiraz has submitted financial programme drawn up by the Governor-General. Essential point is that his Excellency should be guaranteed 6,0001 a month by the Central Government to enable him to meet expenses of his administration. He has suggested Imperial Bank of Persia should open a credit account on which he can draw freely to this amount; that all revenues of the province should be paid into this account, and that any shortage should be made good by the Government. Manager of the Imperial Bank after reference to Shiraz informs me he cannot do this and the treasurer-general has no funds at his disposal which would allow him to give necessary guarantee. Success of the new Governor-General’s mission is problematical, but its failure is assured if his Excellency cannot rely on securing sufficient funds for carrying on the administration. Should he succeed in restoring order the revenues of the province would more than suffice to produce the sum required in a few months. In normal times revenues are estimated to produce about 150,000L a year but their present possibilities cannot be gauged until a European representative of the treasurer- general, who will reach Shiraz in about three weeks, has had time to study the question. He will control revenue and expenditure. Want of money is urgent, and the future of the situation depends largely upon whether it can be 'found or not. Most fortunate results might follow should His Majesty’s Government be able to make some arrangement for financing the Governor- General, for a few months, through the Imperial Bank of Persia.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Maje s ty’s Government.] 1 w PERSIA.

With reference to your despatch No. 129 (27777/12) of July 9th, in which you ask for an expression of my views regarding certain allegations made incidentally by the Tehran Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia against the Treasurer General, I have the honour to report that I have for some time been in communication with Monsieur Mornard respecting the proper disposal of the Southern Customs Pevenu.es. It appears to be true that the Customs Adminis tration had been following the practice prevailing before the conclusion of the Loan Convention of 1911 of paying certain local charges incidental to good government from the Customs receipts before depositing the surplus with the Imperial Bank. They also appear to have effected out of the Customs receipts certain other payments, such as a sum on account of the gendarmerie in Ears, with the intention of paying an equivalent sum to the Southern Customs account at the Bank te Bight Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart., K.G., H.P., &amp;C., &amp;C., hC.— Bank yk - Bsassa Tehran and thus economising the 'which the Bank charge lor the transfer of funds from South to North, a rate which the Administration consider exorbitant. There have also been payments of pensions etc. secured on the Southern Customs. I transmit herewith a copy of a letter which I addressed to the Treasurer General urging the necessity of dealing with the Customs receipts in strict accor dance with the stipulation of the Loan Convention, and depositing them in full at the branches of the ..ank, after payment of nothing more than the local expenses of the Customs administration. Monsieur Mornard appears to have acquiesced in this protest, with the result that his ajest:/ 1 s Consul General at Bushire now complains that the Governor of the Gulf Ports no longer receives from the Customs the monthly sum on which he counted for* the payment of his riflemen and that consequently order ..as disturbed. I am now trying to arrange with the Treasurer General and Mr. Wood that, the Customs receipts being deposited regularly at the Bank, the latter should, after meeting the monthly requirements for the service ofI of the .Anglo-Indian Loan, the Bank Loan, and the recenl advances made ty His Majesty's Government remit such of the surplus 'back to Bushire as is required for the Local Government and reimburse to the Persian Government the %;■' premium charged for the transfer of that amount, and I enclose copy of a letter which I have addressed to the Treasurer General on this subject. In connection with this question, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a letter from r. Wood, advocating that the various instalments of interest for the above-mentioned Loans should Be brought into line as regards the date of payment. I entirely agree with the course suggested oy one Bank manager, not only on account of the simplicity which will result in calculating the surplus due to the Persian Government, but also on account of the better assurance which will accrue to the Anglo-Indian Loan of priority over the Bank Loan of 1911• I shall be glad to receive your instructions in regard to the above proposal.I may mention that another point of difficulty between Mr. Wood and onsieur I ornard arises from the fa.ct that at Bunder Abbas there exists no branch of the Bank at which the Customs receipts can be deposited, and that hitherto these receipts have been transmitted to Tehran through a local banker, who on account of a claim of his own against the Government has recently refused to honour the bills drawn on him. This matter is now receiving the attention of Monsieur Mornard. I have &amp;c., (Signed) Walter Towniey.03. Sir THE IMPERIAL BANK Teheran, 20th August, 1912. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of yesterday and to note that the sum of £10,000 now advanced to the Persian Government is to be secured in a similar manner to the previous advance of £100,000. With regard to interest on the present advance, I propose to deal with this in the same manner as interest on the £100,000 above mentioned. It would be a matter of considerable convenience both to the Bank and the Persian Government if the various instalments of interest could be brought into line as regards the date of payment. At present interest on the 1911 Loan is made up on the 8th of each month, whereas that on the 'Indian Loan 1 * and British advance of £100,000 on the 20th. If both the latter could be remitted on the 8th, it would serve the useful purpose of having only one monthly settling day on which to account to the Persian Government Townley, ••., &amp;c., Ac •Government for any surplus due to them. * ■ .. tee | I should be glad to know whether tnis would be convenient to His Majesty’s Government; if so, I will submit for your approval a revised scheme for the sinking fund of the “Indian Loan” to date from 8th March, 1913. \ I have, he., (Signed) A. 0.

This Memorandum is intended as a short supplement to the printed departmental Memo randum as to Persian Government Loans dated the 17th October 1910. It is not proposed to summarise the lengthy and often inconclusive correspondence that has taken place since that date regarding the indebtedness of the Persian Government, and projects like that of Messrs. Seligman for making them further loans. But when definite results have been attained, a brief description of them is here given, so far as they have a bearing on Indian interests. 2. The position may first be recalled of the Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903 and 1904 as it stood in October 1910. It had then been included in the general amalgamation scheme of the debts of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and its amount, with arrears, as calculated on the 21st March 1910, was 3l4,281h 16s. Id. For a period of three years, i.e., until the 20th March 1913, interest only, at 5 per cent., was to be paid in respect of it, and thereafter redemption of capital and payment of interest were provided for by 15 equal annual instalments of 30,278L 12s. 7d., covering the period ending the 20th March 1928. 3. A question that came up at the end of 1910, was that of the remuneration of the Imperial Bank of Persia for their services in connection with the loan.* It was decided, after consultation with this Office, that for the three years ending the 20th March 1913, the Bank should retain 1 per cent, interest on the sum of 314,281L 16s. Id., and that for the period 21st March 1913—20th March 1928 they should retain, each year, one-fifth of the interest portion of the annuity of 30,278k 12s. 7d. A Table of Amortisation of the loan, giving the the interest portions of the annuity for each year, was prepared here (Appendix I.), and forwarded to the Foreign Office. On its being represented subsequently by the Bank that the sum of 314,281k 16s. Id. above- mentioned included a sum of 42,261k 0s. 9ck for capitalised arrears of interest, they were allowed to retain one-fifth of the latter sum, viz., 8,452k 4s. 2d., during the three years ending the 20th March 1916// ) 2 4. An important transaction that may next be described was the issue in July 1911 by the Imperial Bank of Persia on behalf of the Persian Government of a public 5 per cent. Sterling Loan of 1,250,000L The Persian Government specially assigned to this loan, subject only to ihe existing prior charges in respect of the Anglo-Indian Loan,' :i: ' the full net Customs receipts of the Persian Gulf, including those of Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Moham merah, and Ahwaz, agreeing at the same time that these receipts should be made payable direct to the Bank. In the event of the Customs receipts being insufficient, the deficiency was to be made good “from other sources of Government revenue,” and further from the telegraph receipts (subject to a prior charge on those receipts up to 1928 on account i of the Anglo-Indian Loan). The loan, which was 1 issued to the public at 96|- per cent.,f was redeem able at par at any time after 1916 after six months’ notice, and a cumulative sinking fund of one-half per cent, was to be provided in respect of it commencing in 1916, and extending over a period not exceeding 50 years. It was stated in the prospectus that “ the annual “ amount required for the service of the loan is for “ interest and for the prior charges until March “ 1913 the sum of 78,214b, and from thence until 1916 the sum of 92,779h Thereafter the annual ” amount required for interest, amortisation and “ prior charges is 99,029Z. until 1928 (when the “ prior charges cease), and onwards from that date “ the sum of 68,750b” According to the contract with the Persian Government, the Bank were authorised to pay off their own debt out of the proceeds of this loan, and to hold the remainder at the Government’s disposal. The arrangements generally were settled in communication with this Office and the Foreign Office, and a letter from the Foreign Office (Appendix II.), taking cognisance of the arrange ments and promising a measure of diplomatic support, was embodied in the prospectus.

In a letter dated the 29th April the Secretary of State for India in Council expressed his readiness to advance on the same conditions as before a further sum of 25,000k For the moment no action was taken under this authority, but in the following August, in view of the situation created by the defeat of a force of Persian gendarmerie under Swedish officers, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs caused a sum of 25,000k to be placed by the Imperial Back of Persia to the credit of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and applied for the refund of a moiety (12,500k) from this Office. This was sanctioned, the amount being paid to the Bank of England, on account of the Foreign Office, on the 24th August. The conditions as regards interest and repayment were the same as in the case of the previous Anglo-Indian advance of 100,000k It may be explained that of the 25,000k received by His Majesty’s Minister, 10,000k were advanced to the Persian Government soon after its receipt by him, and that he instructed the Bank at Tehran on the 24th October last to pay the remainder into the account of the Persian Treasurer-General, making it clear that the money was to be used for the gendarmerie in Southern Persia.

There have been various projects for such a loan, and M. Sazonoff discussed it on his recent visits to London and Paris : the proposal that is now under consideration is that it should be arranged by the Societe d’Etudes of the Trans-Persian Railway, if the financial position in Persia should be found to justify it. Another proposal also has recently been mooted for arranging a loan of smaller amount under British and Russian auspices. 10.

The above-mentioned sums will be lent at a rate of interest of 7 per cent, per annum, and will be repayable out of the first proceeds of the forthcoiumg foan of the Persian Government, and until then the surpluses of the noithern and southern customs revenues, which have hitherto been placed by the two Banks at the disposal of the Persian GoJrnnlent will be wholly and respectively assigned to the amortisation of and to the payment ol interest on the Russian and British portions of the present advance/ 3.

A British loan on the security ofjhe southern customs was spoken of, wi loan on the security of the customs of C 'asp i an Ports ® Communications on the whole subject had massed between the British and Russian Govern ments, when on the 30th January the ^cial Russian Gazette announced that the Russ Government had decided to sanction a loa the Persian Government from .

The Persian Government engages to extinguish all its previous external obligations with the proceeds of the new loan, anc not‘to conclude without consent of the Bank any fresh foreign loan whatever until the loan of 1900 has been extinguished. The Persian Government grants the Bank the right of p acmg, if it thinks necessary, on the money market bonds of the Persian Loan proportionate to the unredeemed amount of the debt, and bearing the full guarantee n , 1 T Dnooion fJrWPrTimfillt.2 Later on, Mr. Spring-Rice reported from Tehran that a clause had been added to the Loan Contract, on the Shah’s insistence, enabling the Persian Government to pay back the debt, if they wished, after ten years. Feller particulars as to the loan were contained in a Memorandum communicated to the Foreign Office on the 17th August 1900 by Sir T. Gordon, after a conversation with the Sadr Azam at Ostend, but a certified copy of the contract was not available until it was procured by Sir A. Hardinge from M. Nans, the Belgian head of the Customs in Persia, and sent home on the 9th December 1901. Ihe expression used in this contract (Art. 7) as to the security of the loan is „ ^ ute ^ les douanes de Perse, d Vexception de celles du tars et des ports du Golfe Persique.” The i P&gt; 01ll(1 be paid off “ d partir du l er Janvier lyiU, on giving six months’ notice. o. The British Ambassador at St. Petersburg protested against the conclusion of this Russian loan without the previous exchange of views that the Russian Government had promised. He was referred by the Foreign Minister, Count, Mouravieff to tlm Minister of Finance, M. de Witte, who maintained that the transaction had been of a financial, re., non-political, character and denied that the Banque des Prets was in any sense a branch oi the Russian State Bank. He explained mat the customs revenues from the Persian Gulf ports and the Province of Pars had been expressly excluded from the security of the loan, so as not to interfere with British interests. 5th Ap ril S l P 90 n O g ' Eiee ' 8 De8 P atch *».

Imperial Bank’s Loan of 1901. (£ 200 , 000 .) to the Persian Government that, in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, the customs of the port of Mohammerah were included in^ the customs o “ Southern Persia.” On instructions from Lord Salisbury Mr. Spring-Rice communicated to tiie Minister for Foreign Affairs a pro-memona m whicii the following words occurred : “ Lord Salisbury thinks it due to the friendship existing between the Governments of Persia and Great Britain that there should be a clear under standing of his views as to the ports of Mohammerah, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and other ports of the Persian Gulf. This is the best way to avoid difficulties in the future. . . x ^ . “ It is not necessary to remind the Persian Government of the circumstances which make it impossible for Her Majesty’s Government to regard with indifference what happens m the ports above “ \s this Legation has recently stated, ^ the control of these ports by a foreign power might lead to a state of things which Her Majesty s Government, in the interests of the Indian Lmpire, would be bound to resist. And this has been recognised by the Persian Government, who, on the 23rd October 1897, gave a written promise that the customs of Southern Persia should_ never be placed under foreign control and supervision. “ r phe Persian Government did not iaii to pear this promise in mind during the recent negotiations, and as the Sadr-i-Azam has informed Her Majesty s Legation, the customs revenues of the above- mentioned ports were specially excepted Irom those which formed the guarantee of the Russian loan. “ lam to state'' that Her Majesty’s Government must hold the Persian Government to the strict observance of this engagement. In replv the Persian Foreign Minister assured Mr. Spring-Rice orally, with regard to Mohammerah, that it was clearly to the interest of the 1 ersian Government to except as many ports as possible from the Russian guarantee, and that he was quite aware that Her Majesty’s Government would not ao'ree to any interpretation of the Loan Contract which included Mohammerah among the ports on which Russia had a lien. At a later interview on the 5th April, Mr. Spring-Rice was told by the Foreign Minister that the expression in the Russian Loan Contract was—“ except Fars and the Gulf of Pars, and he was assured that “ not only m Mohammerah, “ but in every part of Persia where British interests “ are concerned, the Persian Government, before “ taking any steps of importance, would consult “ the British Government.” Mr. Spring-Rice was then instructed that he need not recur for the moment to the matter of the Mohammerah customs unless any fresh incident should arise. 6. The money supplied to Persia through the Russian Government was very soon exhausted, and before the end of the year (1900) there were4 rumours of other loans. At the beginning of 1901 Mr. Spring-Rice wrote that the Imperial Bank of Persia might be asked for an advance of 200,000L on their current account with the Persian Govern ment—-an advance which “ would not be a loan “ within the meaning of the clause in the Russian “ Poan Agreement.” The Bushire customs, he remarked, were bringing in about 1,400k a week®, but he had suggested to the Bank to demand the Mohammerah customs as an additional guarantee, to solve the question raised at the time of the Russian contract. On the 14th March Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed from Teheran that the loan had been applied for from the Bank, repayable by 36 monthly instalments, the security being a preferential claim upon the southern customs. The arrangement was carried through in April, and an additional 20,000k was lent a little later, making 220,000k in all. The rate of interest was 12 per cent. The Imperial Bank, it may be explained, are not allowed by the terms of their concession to lend to the Persian Government beyond the limit of one-third of their paid-up capital of 650,000k i.e. 216,666k (Appendix I.). 7. Still, the Persian Government continued in sore straits for money. They were willing to borrow from the British Government, and they were known also to be endeavouring to obtain a' further loan from Russia. On the 28th October 1901 Lord Lansdowne telegraphed to the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg (Mr. C. Hardinge) to draw the attention of the Russian Government to the fact that any arrangement under which Persia would pass under the financial tutelage of either Power would be incompatible with the maintenance of the independence of the country, recognised by under standings arrived at in 1834 and 1888. A French paraphrase of this telegram was furnished to the Russian Foreign Minister, Count Lamsdorff, on the following day, its concluding words being as follows:— , L Angleterre a ton jours reconvu les inter ets pre'ponaerants de la Russie dans le nord de la Perse.

The position being as above explained, it was decided by Bis Majesty’s Government that the time had come for action. By two letters, dated the 6th and 11th November 1901 the Secretary ol State for India expressed his willingness to advance to the Persian Government the sum of 500,0002. It was explained in the later letter that the sum w r as to be advanced from Indian revenues in order to meet the convenience of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and that the principle, recorded m the Report of the Royal Commission on the Expenditure ol India, of equal division between the British and Indian Governments of diplomatic charges in Persia, was recognised as applying to the case.

The Persian Government till felt themselves, however, unable to accept the iritish offer, and the Grand Vizier informed Sir A. lardinge on the 28th November 1901 that M. de Vitte had refused to allow the Persian Government 0 accept a British advance while practically greeing himself to grant an advance of 1,000,0001. * Oil the 6th January 1902 Lord Lansdowne addressed to Sir A.

The reply was tantamount to a efusal by the Russian Government to consent to he British advance, on the ground that the security ssiemed for the loan of 1900 had been represented &gt;v the Banque des Brets as insufficient. Inrther iral explanations, of no satisfactory characoer, s. 19. B. - I — 6 were given to Sir C. Scott on the 5th March, and on the 10th March he forwarded to Count Lamsdorff, in a private letter, a memorandum making further inquiries in the matter. 11. Meanwhile the negotiations had been pro ceeding for a fresh Russian loan, and by the beginning of 1902 they had been greatly advanced by the withdrawal of Russian demands (1) for a concession for a pipe-line across Persia from the Baku oil-wells to Bushire, and (2) for the repay ment hy the Persian Government of the sum already borrowed from the Imperial Bank of Persia (see paragraph 6). Finally, on the 9th April 1902, an official announcement appeared in the Official Messenger at St. Petersburg of a new 5 per cent, loan of 10,000,000 roubles (roughly 1,000,000b) “ sous garantie des merries recettes “ douaiiieres qui servent de garantie a Vemprunt “ de 1900 et aux memes conditions que pour cet “ emprunt.” It was not until the 30th November 1902 that a copy of this Loan Contract was sent home by Sir A. Hardinge. Its provisions were almost identical with those of the Contract of 1900, but by the insertion of an additional clause the Persian Government was prohibited, not only from “issuing” (emettre), but also from “contracting” (contracter), without the consent of Russia, any foreign loan “ d longue echeanceM The loan was redeemable in 75 years, and, since it could only be paid off “d partir du ler Janvier 1912,” with six months’ notice, the “ financial tutelage ” of the country was prolonged for two years longer, a contingency against which the Grand Vizier had been specially warned in a note from Sir A. Hardinge dated the 28th March 1902. 12. This second Russian loan concluded, Sir A. Hardinge, on instructions from His Majesty’s Government, addressed to the Grand Vizier on the 10th May 1902 a reminder as to the customs of “ Southern Persia ” from which the following is an extract:— “I am, of course, aware that the customs of a large part of Southern Persia, viz., Pars and the ports on the Persian Gulf, are explicitly excluded from the securities assigned for the second, as well as for the first, Russian loan, and that there is happily no immediate prospect that this security will prove insufficient for the service of both loans. 4t the same time it must be remembered that Pars and the Gidf ports are only a portion of ‘Southern Persia ’; that the amount of Persia’s total debt to Russia has just been increased by 1,000,000b ; and that the conditions of the first, and presumably of the second, loan provide, in case of default, for the control and supervision of the customs so pledged by the Russian Bank, with no saving clause as regards those parts of ‘ Southern Persia ’ not included in the term Pars and the ports of the ‘Persian Gulf.’ Sir C.

At the beginning of 1903, after the con clusion in the preceding year of the South African War, important correspondence 0 passed with the Foreign Office and the Government of India dis cussing, in relation to strategical considerations, the method by which His Majesty’s Government should come to the financial assistance of the Persian Government and the quid pro quo to be asked for. There was difficulty in making a direct loan in view of the engagements of Persia with Russia as to future borrowing, and in the final result it was agreed to advance to the Persian Government, through the agency of the Imperial Bank of Persia, a sum not exceeding 300,000k On the 8th April 1903 an agreement (Appendix III.) was signed at Tehran for an advance through the Bank of 200,0 00k, at the rate of 5 per cent, interest per annum. The Persian Government engaged to repay the advance, capital and interest, in 20 years out of the proceeds of the royalties of the Caspian fisheries (Ap pendix II. j; if these were insufficient, out of the revenues of the postsf and telegraphs (para. 42), and, in the last resort, out of the revenues of the customs of Ears and of the Persian Gulf. Sir A. Hardinge at the same time reported that in the opinion of the Bank Manager the absence of any clause allowing anticipations was sufficient practical safeguard against repayment before the end of .20 years, and he added that later on the repayments might be transformed into a terminable annuity. The sum of 200,000k was paid to the Bank by the India Office on the 11th April 1903. Remuneration of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Letter of Foreign Office to Bank, 7 th April 1903. (P.27). Pol. 2400/03- 14. The terms in which the Imperial Bank of Persia were to be remunerated for their share in the transaction are shown in the following extract of a letter addressed to the Bank by the Foreign Office on the 7th April 1903 :— “ I am to inform you that, in the event of a satisfactory arrangement being arrived at, the sum of 200,000k will be paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia by the Secretary of State for India for the purpose of being advanced to the Persian Govern ment, the Bank being the nominal lender, and charging the Persian Government interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, of which 4 per Co-nt.8 will be remitted to the Secretary of State for India, the remaining 1 per cent, being retained by the Bank as a commission for its services in the matter. Any sums received in payment of the capital advance will be paid over at once to the Secretary of State for India without deduction.” 15. It was decided that the amount of the advance of 200,000Z. should be entered in the Monthly Statements, to be sent to India, of “Receipts “ and Disbursements of the Home Treasury of “ the Government of India,” under the heading “Advances Repayable,” and, later, that the same heading should be adopted in the case of various published statements of the Indian Accounts.

The Government of India were far from being satisfied with the arrangements made with the Persian Government in the matter of the advance, and in a telegram dated the 7th May 1903 they observed as follows :— “ Through the whole correspondence we have pressed for the southern customs as first security. It now appears that customs rank only as third security and are confined to customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf, a phrase that we thought extremely ambiguous.” Attitude of the Government of India in the matter of the advance. Viceroy’s Telegram, 7th May 1903 (P. 134.) 17. As a result Sir A. Hardinge gave explana tions in a long Despatch as to the exact financial situation in Persia, discussing the meaning of the ambiguous expression “ customs of Southern Persia,” as used in the Mushir-ed-Dovvleh’s note of the 23rd October 1897 (see paragraph 4), as well as of the expression “Pars and the Persian Gulf.” Did “ Southern Persia ” mean “ Southern ” as distinct from “ Northern,” or “ Southern ” as distinct from “ Central ” as well as “Northern ” ? And was Mohammerah a “ Port of the Persian Gulf,” being 60 miles up the Shatt-el-Arab ? On these and other points much further correspondence passed, until on the 8th March 1904 a compre hensive memorandum was addressed to the Ain-ed- Dowleh embodying previous notes on the disputed points and calling attention to the fact that in a “ Reglement Douanier ” of the Persian Government no mention whatever was made of the customs of “Pars and the Persian Gulf” or the customs of “Southern Persia.” “The latter”—so ran the memorandum—“ are grouped into three districts, “ called respectively ‘Arabistan,’ ‘The South,’ and ‘Baluchistan,’ and before authorising me to “ accept the Customs Regulations in the manner “ provided by the Convention of 1903, His Majesty’s “ Government desire me to come to some clear ( understanding with the Persian Government as ^ to the exclusion of all these three districts, which, “ whether covered or not at the time by the term “ ‘bars and the Gulf of Pars”* are undoubtedly covered by the term ‘Southern Persia’ used in Subsequent correspondence regard ing the expressions “Southern Customs ” Pars and the Persian Gulf,” &amp;c.

He added that he was himself quite of opinion that an end should be put to the practice under which the Persian Government was able to obtain money from the English or the Russian Govern ment by playing off one against the other. . Correspondence passed about the same time between the Foreign Office and the Imperial -bank of 1 ersia- regarding certain cheques of the lersian Government which the Bank had practi cally been obliged to honour, although by so doing it had raised the amount of the indebtedness to itself of the Persian Government to more than 100,000b beyond the limits of the Bank’s concession. (Appendix I ). The question was asked whether the Bank should accept drafts on the Southern Customs payable m instalments, in lieu of immediate repay- ment of the Persian overdraft.

Isvolsky, regarding the intention of the Persian Government to apply to Germany for financial assistance in default of aid from Great Britain or Russia. In the course of this conversation M. Isvolsky stated that he wished to act in harmony with the “tacit agreement’’ arrived at with Sir C. Spring-Rice (para. 2-1), and to consult with His Majesty s Government as to the best means of affording relief to Persia. Communications followed between the foreign Office and Tehran, and in the result an aide- me moire was sent to M. Isvolsky by Sir A. Nicolson on the 14th September 1906, proposing a joint Anglo-Russian advance of 400,0001., or 200,0000 by each Power. The aide-memoire contained the following passage :—“ Le Gouvernement Britanmque 11 propose de prendre comme garanties pour sa part “ d e Vavance: (1) Une hypotheque, outre celle quil “ possede deja, sur les douanes des ports dans le “ midi de la Perse et dans le Golfe Persique; et “ (2) de recevoir du Gouvernement Persau un en- “ gagement quaucune concession pour chemins de “ f er ^ routes, ou telegraphes, ne soit accordee d “ d'autres Puissances d Vest Pune ligne trance de “ Birjand a Bunder Abbas.''* M. Isvolsky was averse to consideiing, in connection with the advance, the important question involved in the second of these conditions, but he informed Sir A.

After some further correspondence the text was approved of identic Loan Conventions to he executed by the British and Russian Banks with the Persian Government, stating that an ad\ ance of 400 000L would be made to the Persian Govern ment, ’of which 200,0007, would be paid at once, in equal shares, by the two Governments. Interest was to be at the rate of / per cent., and the Russian and British Governments could demand repayment a year after signature of the contiacts, on giving three months’ notice. The Russian advance was “ guaranteed by the revenues of the customs already “ affected to the guarantee of the two loans con- “ duded in 1900 and 1902,” and the English advance “ by the revenues of the administrations “ of posts and telegraphs, and, in case of insuf- “ ficiency, the revenues of the customs of Ears and “ the Persian Gulf.” As regards the expression “ customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf,” the text of a note was approved by the Foreign Office to remind the S. 19. I)Persian Government that “ His Majesty’s Govern- “ ment hold to the interpretation already laid down in the note of the 30th August 1904 from this “ Legation ” (paragraph 19). The clause defining the British guarantee differed, it may be remarked, from that of previous loan contracts in its omission of the “ Caspian Fisheries” (Appendix II.). The omission was accepted by Sir C. Spring-Rice at the instance of his Russian colleague at Tehran, in view of the fact that no revenues were being derived from the fisheries. The course of the negotiations is described in Sir C. Spring-Rice’s Despatch No. 280, dated the 9th November 1906, but Sir A. Nicolson in a sub sequent Despatch, No. / / 3, of the 20th November 1906, corrected Sir C. Spring-Rice’s impression that M.

About this time there were renewed reports o the Shah s ill-health, and the question again became pressing of making an immediate advance to the Vahahd of 50,0001. (paragraph 27).

Lord Morley would, however, suggest for Sir L Grey s serious consideration, that the precedent ot the financial arrangements of the joint loan with Russia now being made to the Persian Government should be followed in case of this loan to the aliahd, and that the Imperial Government should provide half the _ capital sum involved, instead of guaranteeing Indian revenues against loss in respect of a moiety of the advance.” The Treasury did not fall in with this propoi /o- t nrv? 7 r ? nt r ed i the mterest aDd capital of one moi (-O,U00Z.) of the advance from Indian revenu ihe sum of oO.OOOZ was paid by this Office to . lank of 1 ersia on the 14th December 1906.

Later, in reply to a dormal request from the Persian Government, a note was addressed_ to them on the 31st August 1907 by Sir C.

Three conditions were attached to this concession (1) that the Persian Government “ would not “ contract any new foreign loan without giving their “ creditors, England and Russia, the option oi “ advancing money on the same conditions ; (2^ that they “should not grant to anyone the “ monopoly of coining silver in the State Mint and “ that, in the matter of the importation of silver,all persons, whether Persians or foreigners, Avill “be treated equally, and without distinction;” and wv if reforms Avere not carried out, “ His “ Majesty’s Government should have the right to “ demaiM payment of the arrears of sinking fund “ at any time within the next three years.” o4.

In addressing the Foreign Office on the 11th February 1908 the India Office took occasion to invite them “ to agree to a ^simple procedure by which might be regulated the adjustment between the British and Indian Exchequers of any liabilities in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan of 1903 and 1904. A memorandum (Appendix VI.) suggesting the keeping of an “ Arrears Account by the Accountant-General at the India Office was enclosed in the letter, and a copy was forwarded to the Treasury by the Foreign Office m their lettei of the 21st February 1908, with the remark that, under the terms of the memorandum no claim would be made against British fnnds m respect “ of temporary and comparatively trifling os _ “ such as that occasioned by the delay of six “months in the payment of interest which was “ granted to the Persian Government m April “ fast.” (See paragraphs 54 and 58.) 38 In the meantime, towards the middle of February, Mr. Marling had addressed a note to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh reminding him that neither “ has the interest on the British loan of 1 JJo 04, “ due on the 4th April 1907, been paid, nor has any s. 19.

On the 5th September 1908 the India Office enquired of the Foreign Office whether any decision had yet been arrived at upon the proposal made by the Foreign Office to the Treasury as to an expla natory statement to Parliament regaiding the Anglo-Indian loan (paragraph 36). Copy of the letter was forwarded by the Foreign Office to the Treasury on the Iffih idem. 41. A few months previously a telegram had appeared in the Berliner Tageblatt that the Shah had promised to pay an annual subsidy of ffioOOb to the German School at Tehran, to be guaranteed by a lien on the Customs revenue. It was ascertained by Mr. Marling that payment of the subsidy was, in fact, to be made from the Customs funds, and correspondence passed with the Russian Govern ment as to a protest to the Persian Government. In the result, His Majesty’s Government decided to act alone, and a note was addressed on the 11th January 1909 to the Persian Government by Sn G. Barclay, who had now become Minister at Tehran, reminding them that the interest on the^ British loan of 1903 and 1904 was in arrear since the preceding April, and adding that “ if the resources “ 0 f the Persian Government are pledged without “ the consent of His Majesty’s Government so as “ to imperil the security of the British loans and “ advances .... or to diminish the several “ revenues assigned to the service of their interest “ 0 r sinking fund, His Majesty’s Government will u Po compelled to consider what steps aie necessary “ for safe-guarding their interests.” 42. On the 2nd February 1909 the Foreign Office addressed the India Office on the question of the service of the Anglo-Indian loan . Sn E. Grey is disposed to think that the collection of “ the Gulf customs by or on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, which a demand for repayment “ would probably entail, would be inopportune at “ the present moment, and might be regarded as u interference in the affairs of Peisia, which it “ would be advisable to avoid as long as possible. “ p[ e would be glad to know whether it would “ be feasible to impound, by the agency of the “ Indo-European Telegraph Department, the pro- “ ceeds of the telegraph revenues, on which the “ advances are partially secured, should his Lord- “ s bip agree that the collection of the ^customs “ should not be resorted to for the present.” In reply the Secretary of State foi India ex pressed concurrence in the view that the collection of the customs would be inopportune, and* stated that he was u of opinion that it would be bettei not to press the demand for payment in a definite “ form till the question of the constitutional and (i financial regime to be established m Bersia has u further developed.’ A note was transmitted of the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Tele graph Department, explaining that some 3,5001.5!S- 20 only could in any case be realised by impounding the telegraph revenues, and deprecating such action as likely to disturb existing relations between his own and the Persian Telegraph Departments. 43. Mention may here be made of a complaint by the Russian Government in the spring of 1908 that the Imperial Bank of Persia had sequestered the customs revenues of Kermanshah (in the Russian sphere) as a guarantee for sums due to the Bank from the Persian Government; it was pointed out that those revenues were part of the security for Russian loans. The Foreign Office ascertained that the action of the Bank had been based on a verbal arrange ment with the Persian Customs Administration, and, the Russian representations being held to be well- founded, a plan was proposed for transferring the lien acquired by the Bank from the customs receipts of Kermanshah to those of Bushire. A note with this object was addressed to the Persian Government on the 4th November 1908, and, in the end, the Persian Government undertook to pay from the receipts of the Bushire customs, as interest on the Bank’s debts, the sum of 30,000 tomans a month (72,000Z. a year) with effect from the 21st March 1909 (the beginning of the Persian financial year). The Bank’s debts, it may be remarked, amounted in all at this time to 526,000Z. (leaving out of account the Anglo-Indian loan), or about 310,000Z. in excess of the amount authorised by their concession. Nearly half the debt was on account of their advance of 200,000Z. in 1901 {see paragraph 6), secured on the customs of Fars and the Persian Gulf.

Barclay had explained ( p - 3 ' 79 -) that the receipts at Ahwaz, Lingah, and Bunder Bel- 3946/09. Abbas should amply suffice for the service of the Anglo-Indian loan. 45. In giving their assent to the arrangement ^ Q ue8tio n of pressing the Persian described in the preceding paragraph, the Treasury wTAT^L f TJ„ aymeUt “ respeCt ° f raised the question whether the Persian Govern- An ^°' Indian loan - ment should not be pressed for a further payment in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan. The Foreign Letter of Foreign Office to Treasury Office considered that such action would be useless ® e P tem hep 1909. in the financial condition of Persia, but that “ the “ question must be considered when Persian finances PoL 4056/09. “ are *set in order, or if a further loan to the “ Persian Government is eventually guaranteed or “ made.” 46. The extent of the Persian Government’s Extent of indebtedness of Persian indebtedness at this time had been disclosed in the Government as disclosed in M. Bizot’s lepoit of M. Bizot, their drench Financial Adviser, Rsport. dated the 15th March 1909, of which the main21 April 1909. ™ Barday ’ S Despatch ^°' 74 ’ 8th features were explained by Sir G. Barclay in the following words :— (P. 154.) (Pol. 3389/09. “ You will notice that, in M. Bizot’s opinion, the need for a loan is indisputable, though he is unable to pronounce as to the amount required. In my telegram No. 152 I gave it as 2,500,000/. at the lowest estimate, independently of the small advances which would be needed for the reorganization of the Departments which most urgently call for reform, and I should mention that in this estimate I had M. Bizot’s concurrence. Besides the Govern ment’s debt to the two banks, amounting in round figures to some 1,200,000L, which, bearing exorbitant interest, cries loudly for conversion, there are other creditors’ claims which, according to a statement given to M. Bizot, already at the end of 1907-08 amounted to 2,751,638 tomans (550,000k). These must greatly have increased during the year just ended. There are also the claims for postal and road robberies, &amp;c., filed by the foreign Legations, of which it would be rash to attempt an estimate, but which must represent a very considerable sum. of the two banks, and to settle the claims of other creditors and those presented to the Persian British and Indian Government’s loan, with arrears of interest - 300,000 “ To pay interest on this at 5 or 6 per cent, the customs receipts would amply suffice, leaving a very substantial sum at the disposal of the Persian loans and advances as at present secured on the proceeds of the customs. The conversion of the 1,200,000k owed to the Imperial Bank of Persia and to the Russian Bank, so as to reduce the interest from 12 to 6 per cent., would effect a saving of 72,000k a year, or nearly enough to pay 6 per cent, on the sum needed to clear off the rest of the floating debt.” “Assuming that the sum indicated above is approximately sufficient to convert the advances MNoJi.

There were ho wever certain later charges, e.g., the ex-Shah’s pension, which, in Sir G. Barclay’s opinion, would also have to be borne by the customs, bringing up the total of such charges to 620,000b, or 80,000L more than the previous year’s net receipts, viz., 540,000L Sir G. Barclay commented on the position in the following terms :— “ It is quite evident that on the basis of M. Mornard’s statement no further borrowing is possible on the security of the customs, and although only the first four items are fixed charges by virtue of engagements undertaken by the Persian Government, the remaining eleven items being merely chargeable to the customs in accor dance with usage, it would be difficult to relieve the customs of any of these latter. The Russian Government would doubtless object to any other security for the payment of the Cossack brigade,, and it is important that the salaries of the European Government officers should be well secured. The rest of the eleven items mostly appertain to the customs administration. “ It is thus evident that a condition precedent for any further borrowing must be the conversion of the advances, &amp;c., of the two banks, and even this would, as I calculate it, only leave sufficient margin for a very trifling loan unless it were found possible to relieve the customs revenue of some of those heads of expenditure with which it has hitherto been charged in accordance with usage. “ The advances of the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Russian Bank carry for the most part interest at the rate of 12 per cent, and over. The debt to the two banks amounts, as I understand it, to be tween 8,500,000 tomans (1,700,000Z.)* and 9,000,000 tomans (1,800,000L), of which I would hazard an estimate that 7,000,000 tomans (1,400,000b) carry interest at the rate of 12 or 15 per cent. The con version of this debt and the reduction of the interest to 5 per cent, would effect a saving of probably 500,000 tomans (100,000b), in which case, supposing that the customs receipts do not fall below last year’s level—and for the first six months of this year they show an increase—there would be a margin! f° r borrowing of 100,000 tomans (20,000b).” Negotiations as to financial assist ance for the Persian Government. Attitude of the India Office. Persia Print, 26tli Fehruary 1910, sec. 4. Pol. 3268/10. 50. Meanwhile the question of giving financial assistance to the Persian Government was con tinuously under discussion between the British and Russian Governments. Should both Governments, or one of them, supply the assistance needed, or should both the British and the Russian Banks, or one of them, come to the rescue ? The various stages of the negotiations are set out in a Foreign Office Memo., dated the 26th February 1910, and it is unnecessary here to do more than mention the salient facts. So far as India is concerned, the position in May 1909 is shown in the following24 extract from a telegram addressed to the Viceroy on the 11th May 1909 :— “ His Majesty’s Government are pledged, subject to fulfilment by Shah of conditions imposed, and to safeguards on proper expenditure of funds, to contribute moiety of joint advance by two Govern ments to enable Shah to meet urgent claims, discharge of which is necessary to secure his position on establishment of new regime. Total amount of joint advance is not to exceed 400,0001. in all in accordance with agreement with Russian Government described in my telegram of 3rd October 190o, which has been treated as holding good in principle throughout subsequent phases of negotiations with Russia. Conditions which made that agreement necessary apply with equal force now, and I recognise that India must in the cir cumstances accept financial responsibility for 100.000L, being a moiety of British share of joint advance. “ But as regards any further financial assistance to Persia, India is free from any engagement, and I have made it clear to Foreign Office that, apart from objections on grounds of general Imperial policy to financial and other entanglements in Persia, I cannot admit that Indian interests in Persia are of a nature to justify expenditure from Indian revenues on schemes for ' establishing reformed government in Persia. Such schemes involve not only financial risk but danger of inter national complications, from responsibility for which it is essential that India should be kept entirely free.” On the 16th July 1909 a new era was entered on in Persian politics by the flight of the Shah to the Russian Legation, and his immediate deposition. 51. On the 2nd December 1909 Sir G. Barclay telegraphed that the programme of the Persian Cabinet, including a proposal to apply for an advance of 500,0001., had been submitted to the Medjliss, and he urged that the British and Russian Governments should not be deterred from nego tiating a joint loan by the impossibility of further borrowing on the customs as disclosed in M. Mornard’s statement regarding the “ fixed charges ” (paragraph 49). The Foreign Office concurred in his view as to the desirability of an advance, and, in their letter to the India Office of 7th December 1909 observed that “Sir E. Grey “ attaches great importance to the conversion of the “ debt owed by the Persian Government to the “ Imperial Bank of Persia, and to the Russian “ Discount Bank, which he considers should be a “ necessary condition of any loan.” 52.

It is true, again, “ that India is part of the Empire, and should take “ its share in the burdens of Empire. The moment, “ however, is not a happy one for resort to this line “ of argument, as Indians are now sharply resenting “ a denial to them of equality of citizenship within “ the Empire by colonial communities not them- “ selves contributing to its defence. It may be “ true, indeed, that order in Persia might help “ Indian commerce. But Lord Morley is not con- “ vinced that improvement in the sphere of Indian “ trade by means of this kind is assured enough to “ justify the imposition of new burdens upon the “ general body of Indians. Nor is he convinced “ that even the conversion of the Persian debt “ would strike either the judgment or the imagi- “ nation of the Indian taxpayer as a specifically “ Indian interest. “ While, therefore, he is reluctantly obliged to “ assume responsibility for the loan of 100,0001. to which he agreed in May last, Lord Morley is not “ prepared to recommend his Council to sanction “ any further advance.” Anglo-Russian Note offering advance (£400,000).

On the 18th February 1910 a joint Anglo- Russian Note, dated the 16th idem, was handed to the Persian Government, stating the conditions on which the two Powers were prepared to make a joint advance of 400,000k They related, briefly, to (1) control of the expenditure of the money, (2) appointment of seven French officials in the Ministry of Finance, (3) formation of gendarmerie or road guards, (4) railways, (5) navigation of Lake Urumiah, and the last condition (6) was worded as follows : — “ Cette avance eonstituera le 'premier versement de Vemprunt sollicite dejd par le gouvernement Persan, si les gouvernements de Grande-Bretayne et de Russie consentiraient a cet emprunt. Dans le cas contraire, cette avance, a,u taux de 7 pour cent., sera amortie en dix versement s egaux, gar antis par les revenus des douanes et, en cas d'insuffisance de ces derniers, les revenus de la monnaie serviront de gar a ntie supplementaire. ’ ’ The profits of the Mint, it may be observed, had been stated by Sir G. Barclay to amount to 5,000/. a month. In their letter of the 19th February 1910 the Foreign Office requested that the sum of 100,000/. should be paid once more to the Imperial Bank ofi'O Persia from Indian revenues, adding that the Treasury had been requested to take similar steps with regard to the British moiety of the advance. Letter of India Office to Foreign Office The India Office consented, and the sum of 100,000h 24th February 1910. was paid to the Bank by the Accountant-General Pol. 2994a/10. on the 25th February 1909. 54. In paragraph 37 mention has been made of a letter addressed by the India Office to the Foreign Office on the 11 th February 1908, suggesting a form of procedure for regulating the adjustment between the British and Indian Exchequers in respect of the Anglo-Indian loan of 1903 and 1904 (290,000L). On the 16th Tune 1909 a reminder was sent by the India Office on the subject, and subsequently demi-official correspondence^' passed between the Financial Secretary, India Office, and the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, in the course of which it was calculated that on the 4th April 1909 the liability of the Treasury to Indian revenues was 147,1631. 4 s. 9d. In assenting to the payment to the Imperial Bank of Persia of the sum of 100,000b, referred to in the last paragraph, the India Office drew the attention of the Foreign Office to the fact that their official letters of the 11 th February 1908 and the 16th June 1909 had remained unanswered, and requested an early reply “ with a view of termi- “ nating the present anomalous position in which “ the Indian Government are pressed to make a ^ further advance, while the Lords Commissioners “ °f ^e Treasury make no effort to discharge their liabilities. A copy of this letter was forwarded by the Foreign Office to the Treasury on the 4th March 1910.

By April it had become apparent that there was littie likelihood of the Persian Government accepting the Anglo-Russian advance conditionally offered (paragraph 53). Accordinglv the India Office suggested to the Foreign Office, in a letter dated the 15th April 1910, that the Indian payment of 100 , 000 b should be refunded by the Imperial Bank of I etsia, adding that there would be no “ difficulty in providing the sum again at verv few days’ notice.” The money was repaid on the 19th April.

Two months later, the question of the Renewed Prospect of Anglo-Russian advance again became pressing, and two letters Advance (£400,000). dated the 18th and the 22nd June 1910, were Letters of Foreign Office to India Office, received from the Foreign Office proposing that, in 18th and 22nd June 191a the event of a request from the Persian Govern- Po1 ' 3570 and 3590 / 06 * * * 10 - ment, the Anglo-Russian advance of 400,000b should be made on the understanding that foreignexperts should be engaged as advisers to the Persian Ministry of Finance, and subject^ to no further conditions, except as regards security and provision for repayment, if a larger loan were subsequently floated ; the security for the entire advance to be the whole of the Persian customs, and the rate of interest to be 5 per cent, instead of 7. India Office to Foreign Office, 29th June The India Office, while assenting to these 1910. ^ ( ^ proposals, suggested that it should be made clear Pol. 3590/10. that the prior lien on the southern customs of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and of His Majesty s Government,would in noway be affected, and drew attention to the importance of separate accounts being kept in respect of the proposed new advance. A proposal was agreed to that, subject to the prior lien referred to, the “ quasi-fixed charges ” (as they now had been called) on the whole of the customs of Persia should be made permanent. It was added that the Indian share of the advance would be forthcoming when it was known that the Treasury were making a similar payment. Amalgamation of the debts of the Imperial Bank of Persia.

In the first half of 1910 an arrangement was carried through, to the importance of which allusion has more than once been made (para graphs 46, 49, and 51), viz., the amalgamation of the debts of the Imperial Bank of Persia. The corre spondence between the Foreign and India Offices - ''' was based on telegrams sent home by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran and the local manager of the Imperial Bank, and the text of the agree ment arrived at, together with that of three supplementary letters addressed by the Bank to the Minister of Finance (Appendix VIII.), was received in a despatch from Mr. Marling, dated the 8 th June 1910. The general character of the arrangements is, briefly, as follows :— Letter of India Office to Foreign Office, 11th April 1910. Pol. 3196-97/10. Letter of Foreign Office to India Office, 2nd May 1910. Letter of India Office to Foreign Office, 5th May 1910. Pol. 3283-85/10. Exclusive payment is to be made to the Bank, in the first instance, of the full net customs receipts of the Persian Gulf ports, including Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Mohamerah, and Ahwaz, and from these receipts monthly payments will be made for the service of the Bank’s own debt, and also that of the Anglo-Indian debt, the interest on the former being 7 per cent, in currency, on the latter 5 per cent, in sterling, as before. No pay ments on account of the redemption of capital will be made for three years in respect of the Anglo- Indian debt (314,2811. 16s. 4d. on the 21st March 1910), but thereafter yearly payments will be made, in respect of both interest and capital, of 30,278b 12s. Id., extinguishing the debt in 15 years, the final payment being due on the 20th March 1928. It was decided by His Majesty’s Government, in the course of the negotiations, not to surrender their lien on the Caspian fisheries (Appendix II.) and on the Posts (paragraph 13) and Telegraphs (paragraph 42).It was also brought forward that the text of the agreement would sufficiently provide against the Persian Government being able to pay off the Government loan except by instalments.

In view of the agreement described in the preceding paragraph, it was arranged with the Foreign Office that it was unnecessary at present for any payment to be made from the British Exchequer to Indian revenues in respect of loss through the non-payment of interest on the Anglo- Indian advance of the years 1903 and 1904. The Treasury undertook, if further default should take place, to ask Parliament to make good the British share of that loss, and, pending such default, they considered that it would be well to defer making any announcement to Parliament on the subject. The India Office agreed that there was no reason for such announcement, “ unless attention is called to the matter.”* The Auditor, it may be remarked, had made in his Report on the India Home Accounts, dated the 2nd May 1910, the following observations : — “ Interest realised from investment of Cash Balance, &amp;c., 47,236h 18s.

Up to the time of writing (17th October 1910), there does not appear to be any immediate prospect of the proposed Anglo-Rnssian advance of 400,000Z. being made to the Persian Government. In a Despatch dated the 15th June 1910 it has been explained by Mr. Marling that the Customs revenues could not be regarded as providing adequate security for an advance of that amount.

See page 58 of Foreign Office Vol. This Bank was founded in 1889 in virtue of a Persian concession and a British Charter. 1 . Its capital paid up was 1,000,000k, subsequently reduced by the writing-off of losses, principally in exchange and silver, to 650,000k By the terms of the Charter there is a liability in case of insolvency equal to the paid-up capital. The capital may be increased to 3,000,000k Bank notes may he issued in Persia to the extent of the paid-up capital guaranteed by a metallic reserve of 33 per cent. The present amount of the note issue varies from 250,000k to 300,000k, four-fifths of which is in Tehran alone. _ Advances to the Government may not exceed, according to the Charter, one-third of the paid-up capital. The majority of the Board is to be of British nationality. Operations of the Bank.

APPENDIX II. (Referred to in paragraphs 13, 29, 55, and 57.) Note on the Caspian Fisheries. In Ills Despatch, No. 23, dated the 22nd February 1903 (P 352) it was reported by Sir A. Hardinge that the Persian Government had decided to raise money by selling for a lump sum the royalties, or rental on the lease, of the Caspian Fisheries. The fisheries had been leased for many years to a Russian merchant of Astrakhan, named Leonozoff, and the latest of the contracts executed was for an extension for five years, from 1920 to 192o, at an increased rental of 20,0001. a year. M. Naus estimated that the sale of the royalties for the 22 years should bring m 350 0001. In a later Despatch, however, No. 149, dated the 10th August 1904 (P 33) Sir A Hardinge wrote as follows:—“The Caspian Fisheries, which “ have hitherto yielded 20,0001. a year, have ceased to be a real guarantee, “ nor would any banker now lend money on their security, since under the “ new commercial regime as between Persia and Russia, the^ Russian “ Government can impose, and has intimated its intention of imposing, upon “ Persian fish the duties authorised by the Russian general tamr instead oi “ the old 5 per cent, ad valorem duty. . . . For this year, moreover, “ and for tbe two following years, tbe fisheries have already been discounted “ to their concessionaire by the Atabeg-i-Azam.” In a Despatch, No. 299, dated the 22nd November 1908 (P. 207), Sir_G. Barclay reported that the Persian Government had pledged the Caspian Fisheries Royalties to an Armenian Banking Firm for a further period of three years—1912, 1913, and 1914. . , T Throughout the correspondence it has been recognised that these fisheries afforded merely a nominal security for the Anglo-Indian loan toAPPENDIX VI. (Referred to in 'paragraph 37.) Memorandum enclosed in India Office Letter to foreign Office of 11th February 1908. (See page 106 of Foreign Office Volume). The debt due from the Persian Government having been practically converted into an annuity for 20 years, payable on the 4th April in each year from 1905 to 1924 inclusive (viz. i 21,133L 7s. 3d. m 1905 and 23,270Z. 7s. in subsequent years), the Accountant-General at the India Office will prepare and keep up an “Arrears Account ” showing the amount due from the Persian Government in consequence of any failure on its part to pay the instalments of the annuity in full at the right dates. He will debit to this account the amount by which the payment, if any, made by the Persian Government on the 4th April of each year falls short of 23,270Z. 7s., will add once a year interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum on the amount at debit, and will credit to the account any sums received in respect of arrears. He will append to the account a statement showing what portion of the arrears represents money that should have been paid to Indian revenues (with interest thereon) and what portion represents money that should be paid to the Imperial Bank (the amount so payable being one-fifth of all payments that should have been made in respect of the interest portion of the annuity, together with interest at five per cent, thereon added yearly). Once in three years he will send to the Foreign Office the account and appended statement, and the Foreign Office will pay to the India Office one- half of the amount by which the debt due to Indian revenues has been increased during the preceding three years. If the debt has been reduced, he will pay to the Foreign Office one-half of the amount of the reduction. India Office, 24th December 1907. APPENDIX VII. (Referred to in paragraph 49.)

His Highness said that some members of the Cabinet declared that they would sooner resign than consent to acceptance of the advance on such terms, and added 50,0001. woidd not suffice to meet Persia’s immediate financial needs. I told his Highness that, although he should not in any way consider what I said as implying a condition attached to the advance His Majesty’s Government were prepared to make in concert with Russia, I had received instructions to press for a promise of the concession for a railway from Mohammerah to Khoremabad, with a port at Khor Musa. I urged upon him that it would be unpatriotic of his colleagues to plunge Persia into hopeless chaos by resigning, as how could a new Cabinet be formed withno money in the Treasury, and who could foresee what might result from such a situation under present conditions ? n . . x . . , I added I could understand Cabinet shrunk from possible future criticism by a Mediliss, but I said that all statesmen have to put up with adverse comment from friends and adversaries alike, and that they must accept responsibilities of office. I pointed out to his Highness that Persia s financial difficulties are so pressing and serious that disruption of the Empire is threatened, and that, m my opinion, by yielding to pressure of a knife at their throats, as it seemed to them, Persian Government would probably perform best act ever done for the future development of the country. I endeavoured to disabuse his Highness of a belief that the proposed Russian line has a strategical object in view, and I assured him that I firmly believe that the coinmence- ment of railway construction in Persia would mark new era in the country s history. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he would lay my views before the Cabinet, and assured me that there is no opposition to British scheme, though his colleagues are suspicious of Russian intentions.

Tehran, August 6, 1912, 4 p.m. ACTING CONSUL at Shiraz telegraphs that gendarmerie has met with serious reverse at the hands of a marauding band under Soulet-ed-Dowleh, about 500 strong, which had taken up a position commanding Shiraz-Bushire road, which was thereby practically blockaded. Acting consul reports that gendarmerie force was composed of 80 cavalry and 180 infantry, with 1 mountain gun, under two Swedish officers; that greater part of them fled without firing a shot, and were subsequently surrounded by enemy, to whom they surrendered without resistance, losing all their arms. Breech of the gun blew up and was abandoned. Small part of force, with two officers, fought for some time ineffectually, but succeeded in retreating to Shiraz. Major Siefvert, who was in command of expedition, was slightly wounded in stomach. It would appear that original intention was for gendarmerie to move out one stage from Shiraz to Chenar Rahdar, and from there advance against Soulet with a force under Kawam, but that Major Siefvert, without communicating with Kawam, advanced alone in spite of urgent representations not to do so. Actual engagement took place near Diringun. _ It is much to be feared that this unfortunate incident will have disastrous enects upon gendarmerie scheme in south, and may seriously increase difficulties of the situation for Kawam, who was about to lead expedition against Soulet, who has become bandit. Acting consul reports that local authorities are in sore straits for money, that soldiers are clamouring for their pay, and that movement of the Government forces can only be effective if maintained, and that this cannot be done without money. I am urging Persian Government to send money at once, but Treasury is empty. I heard, too late to take steps to stop it, of the rash forward movement c&gt;f the gendarmerie officers with green troops against tried tribesmen fighting on their own ground. . . r + • I fear gendarmerie need no longer be taken into consideration as a factoi m the pacification of the south, and it is possible that this disaster may ha\e bad e ect upon corps under instruction at Tehran.

Barclay’s despatch No. 47 of 9th March, acting treasurer-general placed the charges on southern customs at— 1. Service of loans 4,400,000 krans. 2. Fixed charges 2,500,000, while receipts are estimated at 8,000,000. This leaves a balance of 1,100,000 krans, or 20,000/. Treasurer-general’s figures are inaccurate, and I calculate that a further 10,000/. will be required when sinking fund of the Anglo-India loan comes into operation again next year. The question of fixed charges will have to be examined and put on a proper basis \ in the course of negotiations for big loan, but I think that it would be premature and inconvenient to do so now. Under present system bank retains per month from southern customs a proportion of all sums for annual service of the existing loans. Would it not be sufficient for bank to be instructed to retain, and remit to His I Majesty’s Government monthly, a sufficient additional sum to pay the interest of the advance, and to suspend the employment of the surplus receipts for repayment of the advance for twelve months, i.e., until 28th March next ? If no loan has been concluded question can be reconsidered. . . Position of the Russian advance is different, as fixed charges have priority, according to Russian Bank’s convention, over service of consolidated debt, while the surplus receipts are only paid over half-yearly to Persian Government. Question whether Russian Government will forgo immediate repayment of their share of the advance will thus only come up on 14th July, when there will be an available surplus of about 80,000/.CONFIDENTIAL.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 157 of the 5tli March respecting the revenues available as security for a Persian loan, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a communication which I received from the acting treasurer- general, and on which the figures given in my telegram were based. It will be observed that, apart from the receipts of the Maliat, the Persian Government at present dispose of an assured annual income of 4,000,000 tomans, of which sum 2,851,000 tomans are already absorbed by fixed charges arising from existing foreign loans and certain indispensable Government expenses. The projected loan would, of course, include the conversion of the Persian Government’s consolidated debts to the Russian Bank, the interest and sinking fund of which absorb 650,000 tomans annually. Consequently the fixed charges alluded to would be reduced by that amount, and the margin of the assured revenues available as security for the loan would thus work out at 1,819,000 tomans. A 5 per cent, loan of 33,000,000 tomans could, according to M. Mornard, be raised on this security, and, assuming that the issue price were 85 per cent., a sum of 28.050.000 tomans would be at the disposal of the Persian Government, of which 6,000,000 tomans would be required for the redemption of the debt to the Russian Bank. M. Mornard further gives a list of the floating debts of the Persian Government, including that to Messrs. Schneider, and these amount to 1,932,000 tomans. In addition to this sum, the acting treasurer-general has tabulated a sum of 700.000 tomans as representing British claims, and 1,800,000 tomans those of Russia. These figures were given to M. Mornard verbally by the two Ministers as an estimate made on the spur of the moment, and are therefore only roughly approximate. The grand total of the floating debt is therefore placed at 4,432,000 tomans, which, together with the 6,000,000 tomans devoted to the liquidation of the debt to the Russian Bank, may be deducted from the proceeds of the loan, and thus leave a balance to the Persian Government of about 17,600,000 tomans, exclusive of Messrs. Schneider’s claim. No mention has been made of foreign claims other than British and Russian. I have no knowledge of the claims made by the Turkish Embassy, but those put forward by the other legations would probably be covered by a sum of 500.000 tomans. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY.

[Cd. 6103.] Price J d.honour, by instruction of their Governments, to make to the Persian Government the following proposals :— 1. The two Governments are prepared, in order to meet urgent expenditure, to advance to the Persian Government a sum of 100,000L each. The Imperial Bank and the Banque d’Escompte will each open an account for this sum as soon as the two legations have received a favourable reply to the present note, and it is understood that the sum paid into the account by the Banque d’Escompte will be placed at the disposal of the Persian Government in roubles, amounting to the sum of 945,750 roubles. 2. The above-mentioned sums will be lent at a rate of interest of 7 per cent, per annum, and will be repayable out of the first proceeds of the forthcoming loan of the Persian Government, and until then the surpluses of the northern and southern customs revenues, which have hitherto been placed by the two banks at the disposal of the Persian Government, will be wholly and respectively assigned to the amo rtisatiou of and to the payment of interest on the Russian and British portions ofthe present advance. 3. The advance will be expended under the control of the treasurer-general, in accordance with a programme prepared by him in agreement with the Cabinet and approved by the two legations. It is understood that a considerable part will be assigned to the organisation of the Government gendarmerie with the assistance of the Swedish officers. In making this proposal, and in order to attain the ends indicated at the beginning of this note, the two legations hope that the Persian Government will undertake (1) to conform their policy henceforth with the principles of the Anglo- Russian Convention of 1907 ; (2) as soon as Mohamed Ali Shah and Salar-ed-Dowleh have left Persia, to dismiss the fedais and irregular forces now in the Persian service ; (3) to discuss with the two legations a scheme for the organisation of a small regular and effective army ; (4) to come to an agreement with Mohamed Ali Shah on the subject of his departure from Persia, of his pension, and of a general amnesty to his folllowers. Hoping to receive a favourable reply, we avail, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. POKLEW SKY-KOZIELL. No. 2. Reply of the Persian Government, dated March 20, 1912. # M. le Ministre, J AI eu 1 honneur de recevoir la note que votre Excellence a bien voulu m’adresser en date du 29 safar (18 fevrier) dernier, d’accord avec son Excellence le Ministre de Russie, au sujet de certaines propositions tendant a etablir sur une base solide de confiante ami tie les ^ relations existantes entre les Gouvernements persan, anglais et russe, ainsi qua faciliter au Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah le soin de i etablir et de maintenirj ordre et la tranquillite dans le pays. Le Gouvernement Imperial ties touche des bonnes intentions des deux Puissances voismes et anime du desir de donnei a 1 ensemble desdites propositions la suite la plus favorable, a 1’honneur de porter h votre connaissance ce qui suit:— A. 1. Sur la question du credit de 200,0001. que les Banques Imperiale et d Escompte ouvriront au profit du Gouvernement persan, a titre d’avance sur le premier empiunt que la Perse va conclure, mon Gouvernement consent a ce que cette somme soit lembom see^ par le premier produit dudit emprunt. En attendant, les intdiAts seront calcules a raison de 7 pour cent par an ; et les excedents des recettes douanieres du noi d et du sud seront affectes intdgralement et respectivement pour le service de I amortissement et des intdrets de la presente avance. 2. Pour assurer 1 emploi integral de cette somme aux depenses deja fixees par le Gouvernement, et connues des deux legations, le gerant de la Tresorerie generale sera c large par le Gouvernement Imperial de controler les ddpenses imputees sur ce credit. II est entendu qu’une partie considerable de Pavance sera affectee a Porganisation de la gendarmerie gouvernementale avec 1’aide des officiers suedois. B. En ce qui concerne les quatre points de la partie in fine de la note collective, * The French version, here printed, of the Persian original was furnished, as is customary, by the reisxan Government. In order to avoid delay in publishing these papers, the English translation has been made from the French, not from the Persian. 8Government, representing an advance on the first loan which Persia is about to contract, my Government agree that this sum shall be repaid out of the first proceeds of that loan. In the meanwhile, interest will be calculated at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum ; and the surpluses of the northern and southern customs revenues will be wholly and respectively assigned to the amortisation of and to the payment of interest on the present advance. 2 . In order to secure that this sum shall be wholly employed to meet expenditure already decided upon by the Government, and known to the two legations, the officer in charge of the treasury-general will be entrusted by the Imperial Government with the duty of controlling the expenditure defrayable out of this account. It is understood that a considerable part of the advance will be assigned to the organisation of the Government gendarmerie with the assistance of the Swedish officers. B. As regards the four points in the last part of the joint note, the Persian Government, convinced that the integrity and independence of Persia, as well as her peaceful development, are the object of the sincere solicitude of the two friendly Governments, welcome with pleasure this favourable attitude and reply thereto in the following terms :— 1 . In order to prove their earnest desire to establish on a solid basis of friendship and confidence the relations between Persia, Great Britain, and Bussia, the Persian Government will take care to conform their policy with the principles of the convention of 1907, and they take note of the assurances contained in the preamble of that convention. 2 . In accordance with what has been decided in the programme of my Government, after the final departure of Mohamed Ali Mirza and Salar-ed-Dowleh from Persian territory, the mujahids will be dismissed and the other irregular forces will be disciplined and gradually incorporated in the regular forces, as the military organisation is developed. 3. With a view to the maintenance of order and security in the country, the organisation of a regular and effective army constitutes one of the fundamental points of the ministerial programme. It is evident that the army to be organised will be proportionate to the needs of the country. In order to convince the two Powers that they consider the organisation of this army as one of their most pressing duties, the Persian Government will inform the two legations of the programme of this organisation with a view to a friendly exchange of view^s on the necessary points. 4. As regards the departure of Mohamed Ali Mirza and the grant of a pension to him, in deference to the proposals of the British and Bussian Governments, an agreement, which will form the subject of a separate note, has already been arrived at. In order to remove every obstacle to the pacification of the country and to the re-establishment of order, and to ensure that the measures taken by the State for the maintenance of public security shall be effective, the Persian Government are confident that the two neighbouring Powers will not fail to render them every assistance, so as to obviate all danger of a fresh attempt by the ex-Shah to enter Persia. Desiring to act upon the proposal of the British and Bussian Governments, the Imperial Government will grant a general amnesty to the followers of Mohamed Ali Mirza. This measure will of course only apply to events and acts previous to the date of the amnesty, and will not extend to those subsequent thereto. C. Having in the preceding paragraphs given proof of their friendly intentions towards the two Powers and of their sincere desire to re-establish order and security in the country, the Persian Government are anxious to obtain the effective assistance of the two neighbouring countries on the two following points :— 1 . For the immediate conclusion of the loan necessary for the realisation of the reforms, the conditions attached to such loan to relate only to the rate of interest, amortisation, and guarantee. 2 . To effect the evacuation of Persian territory by foreign troops within the shortest possible period, in accordance with the wishes of the Persian Government. VOSSUK-ED-DOWLEH.tfjz 1912.

Mr. ACLAND: In 1903, His Majesty’s Government advanced to the Persian Government, through the Imperial Bank of Persia, the sum of £200,000 at 5 per cent. In September, 1904, a further sum of £100,000 was similarly advanced at the same rate. In both cases the money was paid from Indian funds, but His Majesty’s Government agreed to share with the Government of India in equal moieties any loss through failure of the Persian Govern ment to meet their obligations as regards repayment. In 1900, the Russian Bank made a loan to the Persian Government of 22,500,000 roubles (about £2,500,000) at 5 per cent.; and in April, 1902, a further loan of 10,000,000 roubles (£1,000,000) at 5 per cent, was made from the same source.

I should be glad if you would obtain the consent of the Russian Government to instructions being sent to the Russian Minister, explaining that all other questions, such as loan, Senate, Cossack brigade, &amp;c., should be deferred for later consideration, otherwise so much time will elapse before any support or help is given to Persian Government that situation will go from bad to worse.

The proceeds of this operation would not be large enough to render it advisable to deduct from it our claims. Payment of these should be made from a later loan which might possibly be specially arranged for settlement of forcing claims. ^ The need of money is so urgent that, pending conclusion of the proposed Russian Bank’s loan, the two Governments might make advances to be repaid from the loan on condition that proceeds will be spent under supervision of treasurer-general, and a large portion be earmarked for gendarmerie, which now promises well under Swedish officers.

You should also state in memorandum that, pending discussions as to a loan and to whom it should be entrusted, the two Governments will advance each 200,000£. on the conditions mentioned at end of sixth paragraph of Sir G.

I trust it may be possible to arrange for this advance forthwith. Treasurer- general will prepare programme of expenditure which will include considerable sum for gendarmerie, and we should make execution of this programme a condition of advance. Such a programme insisted on by the two Powers is all the more necessary now that treasurer-general is without the support of Medjliss. It was only this support which enabled Shuster to make a stand against waste and thieving. (Sent to St. Petersburgh.) Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay (Tehran). (No. 68.)

Acting treasurer-general thinks that 200,0001. should enable the Persian Government to carry on for two months. Whether a larger advance is required must depend on when a loan is likely to be forthcoming. Could not each Government advance 100,000k at once, leaving the question of a further advance open for the present ? (Repeated to St. Petersburgh.) It is of great importance that, in view of the situation in Persia, the two Govern ments should, without further delay, authorise their representatives to make the following proposals to the Persian Government:— 1 . They will advance, to meet immediate requirements, a sum of 200,000k | conjointly. The proceeds to he spent under supervision of treasurer-general, and our I share of 100,000k to be devoted to gendarmerie in the south. If the two representa- \ Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.
