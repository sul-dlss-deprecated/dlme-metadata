The Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain, Memorandum, Reference your telegram Ho,A 437 dated 25th June 1942 to Air Headquarters about wireless observation posts on the Qatar Coast, 2, On July 3rd I saw the Shaikh of Oatar at Riyan and ex plained to him what was wanted. He gave his verbal consent to v the establishment of R,A,F, wireless observation posts in his territory and agreed to provide any guards required, 3, Before the posts are actually established will you please give me a few days 1 notice so that I can inform the Shaikh of the number of guards required, of the amount of their pay, and of and the date on which^the place where they should report for duty. At my Interview with the Shaikh he was not in a mood in which such details could have been discussed with advantage. The Shaikh at first stipulated that the men in these posts should wear Arab dress. Obviously he was frightened that men in Service uniform might attract hostile attack. I explained that it was not possible to comply with this stipulation, and that, in any case, details of dress could not be distinguished from the air. The Shaikh did not press the matter further at the time, but I mention it now as he may raise it again. Political Agent, Bahrain. c^h Vf. (t-f.
