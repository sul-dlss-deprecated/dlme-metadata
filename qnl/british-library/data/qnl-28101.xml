Have you any observations to offer on the proposal in the t third paragraph and Beg; rding the revision of the form of claim?2014 5000 5.27 Minute Paper. Department Accountant-General, The explanation you have found of the difference 'between the figures £2,752 and £3423,19. 4 is very interesting, and I concur in the proposal in the third paragraph of your note. The proposal in paragraph 4 is very attractive. It is the same as that made 'by the Treasury in their letter to the Foreign Office of 16th January 1904 (Annex to enclosure 2 of Political Despatch to India No. 75, of 29th.July-1904) in lieu of which we proposed the system at present followed (our letter, of 5th February 1904, enclosure 3 ibid) in the belief that it would be simpler. I quite agree, in the light of experience, that the Treasury plan would have been really the simpler, and that the present system is liable to the defects you mention. In looking into the figures for September 1900 given in your reference I was at first afraid that there.might be a possibility of trouble in initiating the change. The final division of d. and c. expenditure in Persia as shown in the memorandum attached to my printed note of 13th August 1910 (flag D), was out of gear with the real intentions of the Webby Commission and I was afraid that any concentration of attention on the figures of September 1900 might lead to a discussion of the reduction of the excess annual payments by India from £12.871 at September 1900 to £9.568 in 1907-8 (see paragraph 4 on page 8 of the memorandum), and to possible trouble. The Foreign Office and Treasury will naturally wish to satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of the September 1900 figures which are to form the datum lines for the future calculations. Mr.Janes has, however, demonstrated to/to ms that the Indian figures are based on two independent calculations, reaching the,same result:- (1) by taking the difference between the total expenditure in Persia shown in the last agreed annual calculation (that for 1923-4) submitted by us to the Poreign Office and the increase since September 1900 shown in the same calculation; (2) by subtracting from the expenditure in 1902-3 shown in Despatch from India ho.3.1 dated, 12th January 1905 the net increases since September 1900 shewn in their Despatch of 3rd September 1903, Bo. 136. I think therefore that as your figures are based v_ ‘ ; ' ■ on documents already accepted by the Foreign Office, your | proposal may without danger be put to them. You no doubt intend to explain to them how the figures for | September 1900 have been obtained. (Sgd.) W.

These amounts were taken into account in compiling the Persia statements and entered into the increases or decreases of expenditure incurred by the Foreign Office taken into the statements. When, however, the charge in question ceased, no allowance was made, i.e. in the statement for 1914-15, for the decrease in the Foreign Office expenditure involved, see statement annexed. The two sums together amount to £671.3.-., vis. the difference that could not be accounted for in 1926.

Below the draft letter are some notes that have been added with a view to clearing up the question raised in the last paragrarh of the Govenim nt of India’s despatch. It is clear from these notes that the ’extra charge’ referred to was in fact always very much less than £11,50G, and that in any case there is nothing to be gained by taking up this point separately with the Treasury Hi ItIt seems unnecessary to refer to it in the- draft letter. If the Foreign Oifice raise ony Question on it (which is unlikely) they could he told that the Government of India’s request was based on a misunderstanding, and that it is not desired to pursue this point. An explanation on the lines of the last paragraph of Mr. Robinson’s note of today's date might be sent d.o. to the Government of India. L.D.Wakely.Note Jox Sir Arthur Hirt7,el.

If / Note by Mr. Wakely. Accoimtaxit General . Financial ^ecretary. One question may be raised on these papers to which the answer has not perhaps been made clear - viz. what exactly is the meaning of the Government of India’s request (in paragraph 7 of their despatch) to be relieved of ’the liability on account of the extra charge of £11,500 which India has had to pay all these years owing to a miscalculation’. So far as I can gather, this extra charge of £11,500 had not been paid ’all these years’, but represented at the particular date when the figure was given (19.24) the excess of the total expenditure home by India over the exact half-share in the total Persian expenditure which alone India ’nuld have had to bear if exact effect had been given to the true intentions of the m elby Committee - i.e. represented the same difference as amounted to £6,787 (half of £13,575) immediately after the Welby x r ide Finance settlement and to about £5000 some years later and as )artment note 8th Feb. would amount to about £1700 if the existing system 1. of division were applied to the figure estimated in the brief below as the normal total of Persian expenditure in the immediate future. In other words,the Government of India’s request i? - r as simply that pending any other adjustment, they should be debited only with an exact half of the total and not also with an (apparently fluctuating) amount in addition. Is this correct? Perhaps the Accountant-General could without undue trouble gay what has actually been the excess amount borne by India in the last few years? L.D. Wakely. 3.xi.

W.R. I take it that we are now spending very little if anything in what was i 1!rn er's Turkish Arabia. The Political figure is now constant and does not vary with the gross expenditure on either side. A calculation made in 1910 (see No.3 of Print on the Question of revising the arrangement of 1900) gave the Indian excess as £2,752. I do not know why there is this difference, as the conditions then were similar to those of the present day, and the excess should have been the same. The % cause unfortunately cannot be traced without examination of all the accounts of D. &amp; C. expenditure from 1900 onwards, and I understand you do not wish the question delayed to the extent which this would involve. In any case it may I think be taken as certain that the fixed difference is now £3,424 (the last unit varies in some of the notes owing to rounding of ponds). This difference relates to Persian expenditure alone. It has been held that the 'half and half' division recommended by the Nelby commission was intended to apply to Turkish Arabia as well, but I have no figures from which to deduce the Indian excess on the extended basis.

Qua Persia aione the figur^ of excess expenditure by India ought to have been constant since 1907-8 but from causes which again would have to be investigated it seems to have risen from £2752 to £3,424;Political Secretary, I understand that you would like to have this file back for action on the general question, and as considerable further research would be needed before a complete explanation could be found of the large differences between the figures on which your letter to the Government of India of 22nd May 1924 was based and the. later figures given by Mr.Turner (see his note to me of 1st May 1925), I am returning the papers herewith. am The important fact, from the point of view of paragraph 7IB L .f of the Government of India's Despatch of 8th October 1925, is that according to the more recent figures preparedly Mr. Turner the excess of India's expenditure on Persia over that of the Imperial Government is now only £5.424, so that we now pay only £1,712 mere than half the total, and that these figures are constant. As Mr.Turner points out, his figure of £3,424 is comparable with that of £2,752 in regard to Persia worked out by . this Department in 1911, (see page 15 of Print, ^lag D)* 1116 excess expenditure in 1907-8 by India on Persia aid Turkish AjiahijJ| the outlay on which was grouped with that on fersi^ in the statement of Indian Expenditure laid before the Welby Commission (Volume II, page 403) and was accordingly covered by the settlement in regard to Persia, eame to £9,568, of which only £2,752 was in respect of Persia, while £6,816 was in respect of -Turkish Arabia (the latter expenditure has.Apw .practically oeaBed),J so that our position as set forth in 1911 has very greatly Improved as a result of the war.

Cf. l(f Revision of incidence of Diplomatic anci Consular expenditure in Persia. As a result of the recommendations of the Wejby Commission (1900) the cost of Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia has, for the last twenty-five years, been shared in, roughly, moieties by Indian and- Imperial Revenues. The Legation at Tehran and the Consular posts in Northern and Western Persia are maintained and paid for in the first instance by the Foreign Office, those in East and South Persia by the Indian Political Department. The two annual bills e-re adjusted subsequently so that of their combined totals a half £ /y2- (actually a little less) is paid by the Foreign Office and a half (actually a little more) by India. A feature of the arrangement is that neither party may incur new expenditure of more than £100 per annum without the consent of the other: this, though a necessary reservation, causes much otherwise avoidable correspondence, delay and administrative inconvenience The principle of division in moieties between Indian and Imperial Revenues originally applied only to the cost of representation, but was by analogy extended to other “political expenditure' in Persia, which, before the war, couprised mainly loans to the Persian Government, and during the War, unsecured advances of large sums for various purposes, some of whi chF- • which did not meet with the Government of India’s approval. The climax was reached, from the Government of India’s point of view, when the Secretary of State in Council committed them against their will to contribute a moiety of the loan of £2,000,000 promised under the abortive “Curzon Agreement” of 1919. As a result, Council passed a Resolution ’’that the whole question'of the incidence of expenditure in Persia,' as between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers, should be further investigated; and they recommended that, as a preliminary, the matter should be examined by the India Office in consultation with the Government of India ” The Government of India were invited dn August 1919 to submit their views in the first place, and did- so in a despatch dated 13th July 1922. i Put'briefly, the view expressed was that though the original Imperial and Indian interests in Persia which the Welby Commission in 1900 had found to be of equal relative importance, justifying an equal division of expenditure, remain unchanged, new Imperial •interests, in which India has no share, have grown up in the past twenty years to an extent which upsets the original balance between these interests and Indian intere tne Principal examples citpd were the Imperial Bank of ° iLn gl°“Persian Oil Company, and the emergence o. Iraq as a State under British mandate. The Government of India were led. to the opinion that the present ratio,, between Imperial and Indian' interests m Persia was such as to justify a division of expenditure P.415/19 P.3135/22 sts:Minute Paper. Department. P. 130/23 expenditure in future-in the proportions 2 Imperial ' 3 ,1 Inaian. But simply to divide the combined 3 totals of British and Indian expenditure on a new basis would perpetuate the administrative disadvantages inherent in any system of divided .control: they therefore recommended that for the .future the Consulates in Southern and Eastern Persia which lie in a preponderatingly Indian sphere of interest, and are staffed by India, should be maintained wholly at India’s 'cost; the remainder should be staffed-and maintained by the Foreign Office at its sole cost; and the cost of the' Legation and the Consulate-G-eneral at Bushire, both of which serve Imperial and Indian interests jointly^ should be divided in the proportion 2 Imperial: 1 Indian. The Indian posts being more expensively maintained than the British, this proposal was more favourable to the Imperial exchequer than a simple redistribution of cost on the new basis would have been. These views were put to the Foreign Office, in a letter dated 7th March 1923, At about the same time the Minister in Teheran suggested that it would make the Persian Branch of the Levant Consular service more attractive, and therefore more efficient, if the number of superior posts open to its members were increased by the transfer to the Levant Service of certain of those staffed by the Indian PoliticalDepartment; and pointed out that such transiers would lead to econoim/ of nubile funds, since the Consular Service’s standard of establishment is less expensive than the Indian. The Minister suggested also consideration.of the question of the ultimate v unification of 'the Persian Consular Service, i.e. the transfer of all posts in Persia to the Levant ; Service, though he freely admitted that there were some places, especially^ those in which there is a large Indian community, where an Indian trained officer could hardly be dispensed with, and also that the existing system of a Consular body derived from two separate services, though an anomaly in theory, works quite well in practice. &lt; On the 16th January 1924 the Foreign Office replied to the India Office letter of 7th March 1923 | stating that the Secretary of State for Foreign f ^^ a irs could not accept the principle underlying J. ohe proposal that expenditure should be divided henceforth on a ccsis * anc ' seeking to show that India is still interested in Persia. At the same time the Foreign Ofx p ice urged the Heed for reducing the expenditure borne by Imperial Funds. T ° U:ie Office responded on 10th March 1924 by a brief recapitulation of the arguments previously advanced, and a request for the reasons why UilSy ’ and India ’ s deBir ® for a more equitable division of expenditure,were rejected. The India Office expressed willingpess to enter into oral discussion, but asked as a preliminary for some statement of the Foreign Office's position. P.303/24.1058 5000 3/26 India Minute Paper.

This request the Foreign Office again evaded in their letter of 14th March 1924, and proceeded to call an interdepartmental conference which duly 4 / met on the 7th flay 1924. At this meeting the Foreign Office (and Treasury) made no effort to dispose of the considerations previously adduced in correspondence by the Government of India and India Office; but, instead, sprang on the heating an entirely new proposal, which was later set forth in an official letter dated 14th July 1924. The India Office representatives at the meeting contented' themselves with reserving their opinion on the new scheme. : &lt; This scheme may be summarised as follows:- f- x It assumes that the total expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular representation in a normal year on the present system, (1923-24 estimates being taken for the purpose) would be £138,000, and tint under the present so-called 'half and half' system of division India would contribute, on adjustment, £72,000 and the Foreign Office £66,000* The proposal is that arrangements should be . 4 ; made gradually to replace all officers of the Indian service at Consular posts in Persia by officers of the Levant service: that the entire responsibility * for the maintenance of the posts should be assumed by the Foreign Office as each is transferred to the Levant Consular service, and that the Government of• 4 . 4 * •• India should nay, in full discharge of their liability, a yearly contribution. The Foreioni Office’s present contribution is ’'w' assumed to be £65,000 per annum. They are not (or were not in 1924) prepared to nay more than that. But they are nrenared to continue to nay that, and they calculate that when all the posts are staffed 1 the Levant service the total annual cost will be reduced to £115,000. Thus when the transfer is- connlete I nd I eh s co ntr i bur i o n w o ul cl be r e du c e d, by nr o : vr essive economies as more and more posts are transferred, to £50,000.

Sir I aw directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to invite a reference to Foreign Office letter of July 14th, 1924, and to subsequent reminders (the last of which was E 5771/480/34/1924, sent to you on November 9th, 1925) on the subject of the incidence of expenditure in connection with the Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia. 2. I am to enquire whether the Earl of Birkenhead has now received the observations of the Government of India on this subject, and whether Sir Austen Chamberlain may shortly expect to receive an expression of His Lordship’s views, as he is anxious to proceed to the early discussion of this subject. I am . rhe Under Secretary of State India Office\Bl Political Secretary, Following the line of your memorandum to the Under Secretary of State of the 28th July last, the attached statement has 'been prepared to show the incidence of the Piplomatic and Consular Expenditure in Persia under the original scheme put forward by ? the Government of India, its modification as the result of the offer to share the cost of Sushi re equally with the Foreign Office, and a comparison with the incidence under the existing scheme. For this purpose it has been assumed throughout that Ilohammerah will be transferred to the Foreign Office sphere and the original statements furnished wi th rny memorandum of the 27 th April to the Under Secretary of State should be substituted by the modified ones now appended, the original having been prepared on the assumption that this Consulate would remain in the Indian sphere. In passing it might be noted that the excess cost to the Foreign Office of this transfer is about £350 only, thus - cost under Foreign Office £1,680; hoiety of present cost under India £2638 « £1334, difference £346. n 40 It will be observed that the figures in the comparative statement tally in two instances with those in the Departmental (Political) Note of the 15th July, i.e. (l) agrees wi th B and (3) with D, the difference between (2) and C being accounted for by the transfer of Moharnmerah. The effect of the Foreign Office proposals for the transfer of the entire establishments - except Bushire - to the Levant Service has not been examined, as this Department has no material on which to check the Foreign Office figures, but it should be stated that a total expenditure of £138,000 - the sum quoted by the Foreign Office - is divisible under the existing scheme approximately India, *71,000, Foreign Office £67,000, the standing difference between the contributions being £3,423. AA 'brief recapitulation of the departuy© ^.roni actuals in dealing with the expenditure entering into the summary 'below is as follows:- &lt; The total expenditure 'by India- converted at l/od. the rupee has 'been increased: A.

We ought I suppose, to start by endeavouring once more to persuade the Foreign Office to accept without modification the Government of India's original proposals ( as restated in paragraph 4 of their despatch of the 8th October 1925). Failing in this, we should then proceed to offer, in modification of these proposals, to bear one- half instead of one third of the cost of Bushire,( a concession amounting on present figures to nearly £5000 a year). And, finally, we might further offer to pay for three years a lump sum contribution to Imperial revenues representing the gain to India from the adoption of the new method of dividing expenditure - i.e. X approximately £3000 a year.

I have grave doubts, however, whether it would be possible i 01 the Govt ox India to work the Residency properly, if the staff, with the exception of the Resident, were recruited from the Levant Service. The Resident ought always to be an officer who has served in the Gulf before, and the Secretaryship and UnderSecretaryship are particularly valuable as training posts. Also the methods of work of the Levant Service officers are entirely different from ours, and I do not think that a joint arrangement would be feasible. I think that the proposal of the Govt of India is best, i.e. that the:e should be clean cut division on a territorial basis, end that the Govt of India should man Bushire as well as the other Persian posts for v/hich the are to be responsible. The Govt of India will have to agree to the reduction of the Foreign Office share of the cost of Bushire, and they can recoup'themselves to some extent by reduction in the status of the Residency. They might also find it possible to abolish the post of Undersecretary. ^ ■ &gt;f-M Pratt Telep;rariu j. r/ L/-Jf. s d c? 'OM 3 f) n/ jf- (St' Prom Secretary of State to Viceroy.

The disposal of the case in this Office would in any event have taken some little time, but there has been some delay, which I much regret, in this i * Department. Apart from the fact that the case has had continually to be put aside for more urgent worh, there have been two reasons for delay , (i) the desire to obtain a clear view of the very involved financial side of the case, which is essential before it can further be discussed with any profit, (ii) the desire to say something to the foreign Office that will really help towards a satisfactory solution. It would be easy enough merely to tell the Foreign Office that the Government of India reject their proposals, and revert to their own proposals of 1922. But it would not, I fear, advance matters much. It is our regrettable experienee in all these matters of incidence of expenditure that arguments on a basis of principles, such as were put forward in support of India's proposals, make no impression if they involve any increase of expenditure for the Treasury. The one 'principle* that the Foreign Office have contributed to the discussion in the present instance is that they will not pay more than they have done hitherto. It is not easy to see how in the circumstances any progress can be made. Such chance as there may be of a compromise seems probably to turn on the possibility of reducing expenses at Bushire. From the point of view of India there does not seem toto 'be much hope of gaining anything material in any case at present. The Government of India are satisfied fcith the existing arrangements for Consular representation, though they hold that they ought to pay less. The Foreign Office on the other hand want to introduce a substantial change, as distinguished from new financial arrangements. There is to this extent the less reason - though I do not wish to put this forward as justifying international delay in replying to the Foreign Office - for hastening the discussion on our side. Perhaps Sir Austen Chamberlain might be informed in reply to his letter that the Government of India's views have in fact been received, but that they amount to no more than a rejection of the Foreign Office proposals and a reiteration of their own proposal of 1922; and that the reason why this Office has not already replied to the Foreign Office accordingly is that,as this reply (assuming that the Secretaiy of State agrees with the Government of India) would not perhaps from the point of view of the Foreign Office greatly advance matters, the Department concerned has been examining the facts further with a view to considering whether any new scheme likely to he acceptable to both sides could be suggested. If the Secretary of State thinks it desirable retort in kind, the Foreign Office might perhaps be asked when we may expect a reply to our letter of the 10th March 19S5 on the subject of expenditure in China, of whrch «.

' Ur r, ^A -pb o v 3 U ^ Foreign Office, S.W.l. 2nd March 1926. Private. My dear F.E. Please give your personal attention to a matter on which my predecessor had an official letter addressed to your Department over eighteen months ago. In Foreign Office letter No. E.5771/4 0/34 of July 14, 1924, certain detailed proposals were made to the India Office regarding the re-distribution, as between Imperial and Indian revenues, of expenditure on the Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia. The question was presumably referred to the Government of India and may well have required time for full ( consideration by them, but I trust you will not think me unduly impatient in urging that they should be asked to let you have their views without further delay. In spite of three reminders sent by this Department to the India Office, the last dated November 9, 1925, we have received no answer to our original 1 e tter2 . letter of July 14, 1924. The Foreign Office proposals, which have the support of the Treasury, would, if put into effect, result in an appreciable reduction of the financial 'burden now home by the Government o± Incia, and would also ultimately relieve the Diplomatic and Consular Vote. In view of the urgent need for economy both here and in India, I hope that the proposed arrangement will prove acceptable. In any ca.se, you will agree with me that uhs time h c,s come uO stir up the Government of India to submit their observations, so that progress may be made towards an early solution of this question. Yours, Austen Chamberlain. The Right Honourable The Earl of Birkenhead, etc. etc. etc.Minute Paper. Department. 345 a 5000 4.25 which Revision of incidence of expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia. ) &lt; * As a result of the recommendations of the Welhy Commission (1900) the cost of Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia has, for the last twenty-five years 'been shared in, roughly, moieties Toy Indian and Imperial Revenues. The Legation at Tehran and the Consular posts in Northern and Western Persia are mshtained and paid for in the first instance Toy the Foreign Office, those in East and South Persia hy the Indian Political Department. The two annual hills are adjusted subsequently, so that of their combined totals a half (actually a little les's ) is paid hy the Foreign Office and a half / factually a little more^hy India. A feature of the arrangement is that neither party may incur new expenditure of more than £100 per annum without the consent of the other; this, though a necessary reservation, causes much otherwise avoidable i correspondence, delay and administrative inconvenience. The principle of division in moieties between Indian and Imperial Revenues originally applied only to the cost of representation, but was by analogy extended to other political Expenditure* in Persia, which, before the War, comprised mainly loans to the Persian Government, and during trie War, unseaim ed advances of large sums ft r various purposes, some oi jwhich did not meet with the Government of India’s approval. The climax was reached, from the Government of India’s point of view, -when the Secretary of State in Council committed them against their will to contribute a moiety of the loan of £2,000,000 promised under the abortive “Curzon Agreement” of 1919. As a result, Council passed a Resolution 'that the whole question of the incidence of expenditure in Persia, -as between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers, should be further investigated; •and they recommend that, as a preliminary, the matter should be examined by the India Office in consultation with the Government of India....” The Government of India were invited in August 1919 to submit their views in the first nlace, and did so in a despatch dated 13th July 1922. Put briefly, the view expressed was that Plough the original Imperial and Indian interests in Persia which the Welby Commission in 1900 had found to be of equal relative importance, justifying* an equal division of expenditure, remain unchanged, new Imperial interests in which India has no share have grown up in the past twenty years to an extent which upsets uhe original balance between these interests and Indian interests: the principal examples cited were K the Imperial Bank of Persia, the Anglo-persian Oil Company r and the emergence of Iraq as a State under -British mandate. The Government of India were led to the opinion that the present ratio between Imperial, and Indian interests in Persia was such as to justify a P.416/L9 P..313 5/22f&amp;S) I Minute Paper.

But simply to divide the 3 3 | combined totals of British and Indian expenditure i , . the on a new basis would perpetuate/administrative disadvantages inherent in any system of divided control: they therefore recommended that ; for the future, th&amp; Consulates in Southern and Eastern Persia which lie in a preponderatingly Indian sphere of interest, and are staffed by India, should be maintained wholly at India’s cost; the remainder should be staffed and maintained by the Foreign Office at its sole cost; and » , . .... the cost of the Legation and the Consulate General at Bushire, both of which serve Imperial and Indian interests jointly^should be divided in the proportion 2 Imperial: 1 Indian. The Indian posts being more expensively maintained than the British^this proposal was more favourable to the Imperial exchequer than a simnle redistribution of cost on the new basis would have been. ■ These views wer§ put to the Fo-si®n Office, alter much departmental discussion of the financial aspectj in a letter dated 7th March 1923. „ /jh k £■&gt;- (- . b'-x -1 ivw-'J. h ^ . , But before this was done the Foreign Office sunolied a copy of a despatch from the Minister in Teheran in which he' suggested that it would make the Persian Branch of the Levant Consular service more attractive, and. therefore more T efficient, ii one number of superior posts open to its members were .noreased by the transfer to the Levant oervice of certaincertain of those staffed ty the Indian Political Department; and pointed out that such transfers would lead to economy of public funds, since the Consular Service’s standard of establishment 'is less expensive than the Indian. The Minister suggested also consideration - of the question of the ultimate Unification of the Persian Consular Service, i.e. the transfer of all posts in Persia to the Levant Service, though he freely admitted that there were some p- 'cs, especially those in which there is a large Indian community, where an Indian trained officer couia hardly be dispensed with, and also that the existing system of a Consular body derived from two separate services, though an anomaly in theory, works quite well in practice. To the India Office letter of 7th March: 1923 tn ® Forei e n replied on 26th March by a request | f ° r lnl °raation as to the present cost of Consular posts maintained in Persia by the Government of India. This information was obtained from India and supplied : to tr.e Foreign Office on 14th August 1923 . On 'the 16th January 1924 the Foreign Office replied to the India Office letter of 7th March 1923 stating tnat the Secretary of State for Poreip-n Affairs could not accept the principle underlying the proposal that expenditure should be divided henceforth on a 2;1 basis, and seeking to show that India is still interested,in Persia. At the same time the Foreign Office urged the need for reducing the expenditure borne by Imperial Funds. To P. 1155/23 P .2966/23. P.303/24 3&lt;5i M.345a 5000 4.25 The Minute Paper.

The India Office&lt;expressed willingness to enter into oral discussion, 'but asked as a preliminary for some statement of the Foreign Office’s position. This request the Foreign Office,again evaded in their letter of 14th March 1924, and proceeded to call an interdepartmental conference which duly met on the 7th May 1924. At this meeting the Foreign Office (and.Treasury) made no effort to dispose of the considerations previqusly adduced in correspondence by the Government ox India ano. Indie- Office; but instead^sprang on the meeting an entirely new proposal, which was later set forth in an official letter dated 14th July 1924. The India Office representatives at the meeting contented themselves t with reserving their opinion on the new scheme. This scheme may be summarised as folrov/s.- It is assumed that the total expenditure ox. Diplomatic and Consular representation in a normal year on the present system, (1823-24 estimates being taken for the purpose) would oe £13o,oQu , ^ under the present' so-called '-half and half' system of division India would contribute, on adjustment, £72,000 and the Foreign Office £66,000.The proposal is that arrangementsshould he made X gradually to replace all officers of the Indian service at Consular posts in Persia by officers of the Levant service; that the entire responsibility for the maintenance of the posts should be assumed by the Foreign Office as each is transferred to the Levant Consular service, .and that the Government of India should pay, in full discharge of their liability, a yearly contribution. x except apparently Bushi re; ru u this is not clear. The Foreign Office’s present contribution is £66,00^ per annum. They are not prepared to pay more than that. But they are prepared to continue to pay that, and they calculate that when all the posts are staffed by the Levant service the total annual cost will be reduced to £116,000, Thus when the transfer is complete, India’s contribution would be reduced, by progressive economies, as more and mure posts are transferred, to £50,000. (If Bushire also were to be transferred, the Foreign Office^estimate tnau the total annual cost might be reduced to £97,000; in that event India’s.contribution would presumably be scaled down lower still. ) This scheme the Foreign Office believe to be the only way to effect a substantial reduction of expenditure from Indian Revenues without a j * corresponaingly substantial increase of expenditure from Imperial Fands, a contingency which the then * &lt; secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, at any rate, stated that he was not prepared to contemplate. There are obviously several respects in which this scheme may be subjected to cdticism; but as a first ,2650/25. %Minute Paper Department. step the Secretary of State without offering any johservat ions hirnsel i , asked the Government of India for their comments, on 25th August 1924. p. 3 6 60/25 . The Government of India replied fourteen months Later in a despatch dated 8th October 1925, after' consulting officers serving in South and East Persia, ~ a process which no doubt took some time. Briefly, they reject the scheme. Their reasons for doing so are (i) The point at which India’s contribution would be reduced to £50,000 will not be reached for many years, and the relief that India will receive in the meantime will not be great. ' &lt; (ii) Even when that point is reached India will be paying nearly half the total, which is a share greater than the Government of India consider equitable / for reasons already stated. (iii) If all consulates were manned by Levant service officers the Government of India would lose the control that they now have, and think necessary in areas where India has special interests. ( iv) Levant service officers could probably not deal with Indian communities in Persian towns as well as Indian trained officers can. (v) The Government of India would find it increasingly difficult to justify to publi opinion the expenditure of Indian Revenues Persia without representation. Indian increasingly difficult to justify to public_ opinion the expenditure of Indian Revenues in ia without representation. Indian opinion is already critical of the fact that India alone of the component parts of the Emnire contributes to His Haj est-y’s Government ’ s Diplomatic and Consular expenditure, and would resent the continuance of a contribution towards that in Persia / if simultaneously oifrcers of the Indian service were replaced by Levant Service personnel. Therefore the Government of India press for the acceptance of their previous proposal, that ^hey should 345a 5000 4.25should continue to man, and pay entirely for, the establishments at Meshed, Seistan, Duzdap, Bandar Abbas and Kerman; man Bushire and pay 1 of its ^ ' 3 cost and of the Legation’s cost; the Foreign Office to man and pay for the rest including 2 of tfijte j &lt;wj Jb iZ ) 3 7 Legateons. This would give either party free scope -lqi and some incentive for economy in its sphere, seem now to have reached an impasse ; (1) The Foreign 4 Office propose to take over, gradually, all Consular posts in Posts in Persia: tne Government of India object to this, and could only consent if they were relieved, pari passu oi the duty of contributing to the cost of * representation in Persia. Conversely, the Government of India are unwilling to continue to contribute unless and to the extent that India is directly represented in Persia. (2) The Foreign Office decline to contemplate the possibility of an increase in the sum borne by Imperial Revenues on account of the cost of representation in Persia . either of the two courses suggested directly or indirectly by the Government of India in ( 1 ) would inevitably involve such an increase.’ (3) The Government of India urge that the course of events in the past twenty or twenty five years nas pie-existing balance between Indian snd Imperial interests in Persia. This contention the Foreign Office either will not or cannot r ' ce ; they have hitherto just ignored it.ed 10th 7 1924. P.3148/24 From India Office to Foreign Office, dated 10th March 1925.

Sir, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India in Council to refer to your letter of the &lt;l 7 th September, 1923, No E.7786/2539/34, in which a request was made for an increase in the contribution at present paid by the Government of India towarda the cost of British diplomatic and consular representation in China. In reply I am to enclose, to be.laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a despatch from the Government of India in which their views upon this question are stated. The Government of India are strongly of opinion that there is no longer any V. justification for such a contribution from Indian revenues. They point out that the conditions obtaining when this contribution was first made have entirely altered, and they draw attention to the anomaly, so inequitable to the Indian taxpayer, that India alone among the Dominions and Colonies of the Empire contributes to the cost of diplomatic and consular representation in foreign countries. The Secretary of State in Council agrees with the Government of India that, in view of the treatment accorded to the other Dominions and Colonies of the Empire, of the terms of Resolution 4 (A) (i) of the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923 to which they refer and of the fact that the Kashgar Consulate in whole and the Tengyueh Consulate in part are maintained from Indian Revenues, which also bear the cost of a considerable staff for dealing with s Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.with Tibetan affairs, the annual contribution of £12,500 made by India towards the cost of the Diplomatic and Consular establishments in China should now cease, and he would propose accordingly that the rebate of this amount afforded by this Office to the Treasury in the division of the cost of the Secretary of State*s establishment should terminate with the 33-st March next. I, have etc. (Sgd) L.D.Wakely.I 109 3000 2/25 Department Minute Paper. Political Secretary, In my view the only satisfactory way of I approaching this problem is to calculate the effect of the various proposals on what we consider the correct basis as regards exchange, &amp;c. and to argue the matter with the Foreign Office in the light of the calculations ) so made. I do not think that, in the long run, anything will be gained b^ attempting to vaiy the basis so as to arrive at more acceptable figures, A preliminary point for decision is whether the arithmetical statements and arguments used are to relate to Persia alone, or to Persia and Turkish Arabia. So far as I am aware, expenditure in Turkish Arabia is now confined to our payments in respect of Jeddah (we pay a sum of £1200 a year in respect of Jeddah and MomeiR, rounded from £790 for Jeddah and £474 for Momei/0 and I understand that these payments can be justified on special grounds. Therefore the only reason for including Turkish Arabia would be that we wished to make capital out of the divergence of pa$t practice from the Welby Committees recommendation for half and half division. It is not quite clear to me that the Welby Committee intended their recommendation to extend to | Turkish Arabia, but it seems to have been assumed in the i B : past that they did so intend. In any event I do not j suppose that the Treasury would be much moved by a reference to past overpayments. I have, therefore, drawn up statements relating to payments in Persia alone. A second point is whether it is advisable to attempt to support our case regarding Persia by reference l to the payments we make in regard to Diplomatic and j Consular expenditure elsewhere, ( e.g. Chlengmai ,* China Sec »I doubt myself whether anything would he gained by so doing, and I understand you share this view. With regard to the basis of the calculations, it must be borne in mind that what we are aiming at is an estimate of the results of a normal year in the future. The only really defensible basis on which such an estimate can be drawn up is the latest available figures of expenditure (the estimate for 1923-24) converted where necessary into sterling at Is.od, which must be regarded as the probable future rate. The actual figures of earlier years wall not throw any real light on the problem. They are complicated by abnormal items and arrears, and the rates of exchange varied considerably. I do not tnmx much would be gained by waiting for the actual figures for 1923-24. So far as they differ from the estimates, it will probably be through the introduction of further abnormal or arrear itemsj for uhe purpose in view, the estimates are probably more useful than actuals. It has been necessary to adjust the figures of the estimates in certain respects. Many of these adjustments are suggested in your not^ but it will be well to recapitulate them. It has been assumed that India will pay, in addition to the cost of the sea places named in their despatch, the full cost of {ingah anu. of uhe Vice Consul at Mohammerah. Trie cost of the Shiraz Hamadan and / » Kermanshah Consular Escort, included under Tehran, has been taken at Rs.36,220, and included in the attached statements under Shiraz.

QU £3,506 plus £428 for non effective charges, Di'Z.ful and Shustar have been omitted. The cost of buildings and non effective charges, ; less fees, shown in lump in the Foreign Office statement, J has been assumed to be related half to the Legation half to the remaining consulates. On these assumptions the total payments by India and the Foreign Office respectively, under the existing arrangements, would be as follows I HD I A.

It will be seen that the India Office pays £66,179 and the Foreign Office £75,5f5. This makes the Foreign Office share £6,500 more than on the present basis and over £9,000 more than the India Office share.

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. SECRET. Near East. Subject. — Incidence of Diplomatic and Consular Expenditure in Persia. To The Right Hon’ble the EARL of BIRKENHEAD, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 8th October 1925. My Lord, We have the honour to refer to your predecessor’s telegram No. 2409, dated the 25th August 1924, in which we were asked to submit our views on the proposals made by the Foreign Office in their letter No. E. 0771-480/34, dated the 14th July 1924 for the incidence of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia. We regret the delay which has occurred in forwarding them which has been chiefly due to our anxiety to devise, if possible, (in consultation with our officers stationed in Southern and Eastern Persia) some formula acceptable alike to the Imperial and Indian Governments. 2. We appieciate the accommodating spirit which has prompted the Foreign Office to make their proposals and consider that the new principles of division, on which they are based, will contributenpt a little to a final settlement of this difficult question. In particular we welcomjproposal which would fix a definite limit to our commitments, and we understand that under it we should not be called on to bear any portion of exceptional expenditure such as that to which we have raised objection in the past. The wording of paragraph 10 of the Foreign Office letter however leaves us in some doubt on this point. 3. We see, however, several objections to the Foreign Office proposals. First it appears to us that the point at which India’s annual contribution would become fixed at £50,000 would be unlikely to be reached for many years, and that the relief that we should receive m the meantime would not be great, A useful index to what extent the hopes of savings built up on a transfer of Consu lates from the Indian to the Levant establishment are likely to be fulfilled, would be furnished by the savings that have accrued from the transfer that has taken place at Ahwaz during the past year. Secondly even with an eventual contribution of £50,000 India would appa rently be paVing little short of half the total expenditure and for the reasons we have previously put forward, we consider that this would be unfair to her Thirdly, if all Consulates were to be manned by officers of the Levant service, we ourselves would lose that small amount of control that we stall exert and consider it advisable that we should exert, in areas where India has special interests. Fourthly though we have no doubt that officers of the Levant service would bend their bSt endeavours adequately to represent obvious that they would not be ^S^ed re!,twe m lndil ti S aild wffich perhaps oM S Indian traders and communities in Persia would only value at its proper worth when actually deprived of the great assistance such knowledge affords. MC547FDFifthly, and this is an objection that has perceptibly gathered force since last we addressed you on the subject, we should find it increasingly difficult to justify to an already sensitive public opinion, Consular and Diplomatic expenditure in Persia without representation. Political India is now actively critical of Indian contribu- tionsTbwardFfhe upkeep not only in Persia but elsewhere, of appointments held by members of the Diplomatic service from which Indians are at present under rule specifically debarred, and of Consular appointments in which Indians are very sparsely represented indeed. Well-informed Indians recognise, it is true, that India has special and highly important interests in some at any rate of the areas in question. But while this is to them some justification for India’s participation in His Majesty’s Government’s Consular and Diplomatic expenditure, in which no other members of the Empire have a share, it is for them not unnaturally an argument for the expansion and not the contraction of Indian participation in the personnel. From this point of view the substitution of officers of the Levant Consular Service in the appointments that still are manned by officers of the Indian Political Depart ment, would be a retrograde measure which would focus hostile attention, certainly in India, and also to judge from recent questions in the House of Commons perhaps in certain quarters in England, on the apparent anomaly of India alone of the component parts of the Empire contributing towards His Majesty’s Government’s Consular and Diplomatic expenditure. 4. These reasons induce us to commend once again to His Majesty’s Govern ment the proposal made in our despatch No. 5 of 1922 for a division on a territorial basis. We would wish to man with our own officers Meshed, Sistan Duzdap, Bushire, Bandar Abbas and Kerman, and to assume the whole responsibility for ordinary Diplomatic and Consular expenditure on these posts with the exception of Bushire. Of similar expenditure at Bushire and Tehran we are prepared to meet one-third. 5. If such a territorial division were made it would be possible for both sides to make economies in their establishments, and the motive for economy would be stronger. We have already been considering the possibility of reducing the cost of our Consular escorts and medical establishments and hope that we shall succeed ia doing so. 6. We are even prepared, if an immediate decision is reached on these lines, to waive our claim for retrospective adjustment. 7. Finally, we feel constrained to request that pending final decision steps may be taken forthwith to relieve India of the liability on account of the extra charge of £11,500 referred to in paragraph 3 of Mr. Wakely’s letter No. P. 2293, dated the 22nd May 1924 which India has had to pay all these years owing to a mis calculation. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servants,Reference Paper. Accountant-General’s Department. J-JC ? 0 fa \f ytO I—'C-4 I think the previous calculations on the files are useless for our present purpose because 1. Those for periods prior to 1923-24 have been made to include places outside Persia, 1 presume that charges in respect oi -Bahrein, Koweit, j useat, etc. will, as heretofore, be adjusted separately. Incidentally in 'hose calculations the contribution paid to the Foreign Office consequent on the Welly Committee’s recommendations has, been taken at .£2,667.10,0; the amount actually payable in respect of Persia alone is £487,10.0 only. 2. The Indian statements contain abnormally heavy charges on account of readjustment of arrears, 5 which would not arise in a normal way.Considerable sums have 'been included on the Indian side in respect of expenditure which would not have been incurred except for the extraordinary conditions prevailing in Persia, during the 'far; expenditure which moreover, if it had been on the Foreign Office side would have been met from funds specially * provided for the purpose. Thus in the statement for 1922-23 will be found the following:- p.2. Rs.30,000 Equivalent to £2,000 advanced by Sir P.Cox to Bakhtiaris in 1915. p.3. Hs.303,284.11.10. Charges o/a net loss on flour sent to Shiraz in 1916-1917. p,5, Rs.447,953*0.5 Expenditure on Bakhtis,ri levies etc. in 1917, 1918 and 1919. Following the line taken by the Foreign Office I have had worked out the division of expenditure for 1923-24. On the basis of the estimates by India and the Foreign Office the amounts are:- India 72,000 Foreign 0ffic e 68,000 Foreign Office 87,000 As a check I have worked also the figures for 1922-23. These are:- (a) Including the three items mentioned at (3) above- India 90,000 (b) Excluding them India Foreign 'Office 65,000. 61,000. The above results are arrived at by accepting the figures given in the various statements supplied by India and by the Foreign Office without criticism, savesave for the rejection of the 3 items mentioned above. I have no means of estimating to what extent it is correct to take the estimate of 1923-24 as a t*#e average. Attention may however he called to one point. The rise in the Indian expenditure is largely due to exchange, and exchange will he still hi ;her in 1924-25 (average official rate S~ &amp; 1.5,417). In fixing a rate for the future it woulci he reasonable to assume 1/6, Applying this rate to the rupee estimate of 1923-24 and assuming that the Foreign Office expenditure remains unchanged, the expenditure of the foreign Ciiice anci India Office respectively wou1d be £72,000 and £V h ,cuO.Statements comparing the Estimated Expenditure being incurred in 1923=24 by the Government of India on Diplomatic and Consular Ser vices in Persia with that in curred in the year ■ , 1920=21 (With separate Statement for Koweit Agency.)Explanatory 'Note. 1. Statements in the same form as those furnished in connection with the annual adjustment of expenditure in Persia, showing the cost of each of the posts in Persia under the administrative control of the Government of India have been drawn up on the basis of expenditure which is being incurred during 1923-24, and in the case of fixed charges the expenditure has been calculated on the basis of the latest information available whereas in the case of varying charges an approximate estimate has been made. For purpose of comparison the actual figure for 1920-21 has been shown. 2. Pension contribution has been calculated at the rate of 40% of pay in respect of I. C. S. and Military officers who joined posts in Persia from 1st January 1922, the date of introduction of the Fundamental Rules as fixed by the Govern ment of India ; but in the case of other officers the rates of contribution not having been changed the old rates have been taken. The adequacy of the present rate of 4 as regards officers other than those belonging to the I. C. S. and the Army is however, under consideration and the rate may be enhanced. The figures arrived at have been compared with the corresponding figures for 1920-21. 3.

F 0 reign Office proposals for the transfer of Indian political Department posts to the Levant Consular Service, -V i Copy to ^ ^ ■ x /M ' FOR USE BY DEPARTMENTS ONLY. Dr on Previous Papers 1 i IO 1379—2 2000 4/20This letter presents officially a suggestion made orally on 7th May by the Foreign Office representatives for solving the problem of how to revise the incidence on Indian and Imperial Revenues of the cost of Diplomatic and Consular representation in Persia. It will be observed from the preceding correspondence that the Foreign Office have never combatted effectively the argument put forward by the Government of India and this Office that as a result of the events of the last 24 years Imperial interests in Persia stand now, in relation to Indian, in the proportion roughly of 2:1; possibly the Foreign Office admit, to themselves, the correctness of the argument. But the application of this proportion to the actual division between &gt; the Imperial and Indian Exchequers of expenditure at the present rate would mean that the former would have to contribute more than it does at present^to the cost of Diplomatic and Consular representation in Persia. This fact, as the present letter reveals, is more than the Treasury can face, even though the increase would amount only to a few thousands a year - and is, in our view, entirely justified by the facts of the case - ; and accordingly the Foreign-Office put forward an alternative proposal whichamounts to a practically complete, though gradual, elimination of the Indian Service officers from Consular posts U in Persia. It is obvious, and the Foreign Office letter clearly demonstrates,that this change would lead eventually to aconsiderable annual saving of money; but the letter is confined almost whdLy to the financial aspect and does not dead with the very considerable questions of a non-financial nature which are involved by the proposal. Setting aside as a matter largely • of0151 3000 G.23 [0019] of Minute Paper ts e spetiii eatati perial in tin adiait, the between le presert ;e 20 Jons’dla? .etter igh the and is, ;e *; ■ native p gjadusii r posts riy iconsi^ ushire see 'below. JS'' t #1 of sentiment the Toreek with, the' past that the elimination of the Indian Political Department from Persia would create, these questions seem to resolve themselves into different facets of the one main question whether the monetary saving that would result from the proposal would he sufficient compensation for the loss of efficiency that would seem likely to result. Though there are no doubt exceptions in either direction^ it is probably generally true that the Indian Political Department (recruited by careful selection from the junior ranks of the Indian Civil Service, or of the Indian Army ^o wnich the picx of the Sandhurst cadets make or used to make their way) i is a. better service than the Levant Consular Service, Dr its Persian branch at any rare* This possibl© inferiority of the latter is doubtless due to i facts that it is, throughout a less well paid service and less attractive owing to its restricted scope 'Thioh offers few prospects of advancement - it -J-i. iiii ln only one Consulate General and three Consulates: &lt; the former fact is of course the cause of the economy wnicn jfould result from adoption of the Foreign Office’s proposal; the latter would lose some of its iorce as is proposed, a second (and possibly third ) Consulate General and five more Consulates were added f. the proposal . 1;o the ca a r e of the Levant Consular Service (Persia), b the very restrict ^ I L HI l/iiC V CX J J .

(In this connection reference is ted. to Sir P.Loraine’s despatch ITo .5.32 of 19th Der 1922 in which he discusses tentatively the Lstrihution of Consular posts in Persia 'between two services.) The Government of India will not, irer, overlook the fact that what is added to the it Service is taken avray from the Indian Political rtment and that what the former gains the latter 3 (though perhaps not quite in proportion) in r of attraction of suitable personnel. The question regains-and the Government of India will no doubt give careful consideration to it - whether officers of the Levant Consular service can ever be so competent to deal with questions arising at posts in Eastern and Southern Persia, where Indian interests j are strong and Indians numerous, as Indian Political officers familiar, from the beginning of their f service, with Indians and their peculiar problems, ©i It will be noted that in their letter of 11th June 1923, the Government of India while admitting the force of Sir P.Loraine’s argument for a unification of the Consular Service in Persia, were strongly opposed to handing over to the Levant service any post - even Kerman - where ’’there are peculiar Indian local interests'; the only post, indeed, which they were willing to transfer was Ahwaz. It should be noted also that Sir P.Loraine himself was very doubtful whether P.18Q/23 flagged, p.2484/2361-51 3000 6.23 [ 6019 ] m) Minute Paper. . Department. whether Mohacnmerah, where a large number of Indians are to be found, could in practice be put in charge of a Levant service officer; and the factors that i j caused his doubts in regard to Mohaitmerah, are probably existent in greater or less degree in other posts now staffed from the Indian Political Department. This question however is one on which it is difficult to form an opinion without local knowledge. The only argument other than that of economy which the Foreign Office adduce in support of their proposal is that of the “better co-ordination in “administration which.would result from the abolition ‘‘of the dual form of control inevitably involved by ‘‘the present system and... the lesser, but still ‘I’substantial, advantage of escaping much interdepartmental t correspondence and other work caused by the present *'arrangements for sharing expenditure”. From the remainder, of the paragraph (paragraph 5) from which this is quoted^it appears that what the Foreign Office |mean by a “better co-ordination of administration” is jthe advantage of having consular officers in the i |provinces of Persia subordinate to the Minister and i to him only, instead of officers subordinate to the Minister, in respect of their Consular position, at the^moment, but, in respect of their service generally and in certain cases (e.g. the Consul General i Meshed who is also Agent to the Governor General of India in Khorassan, and the Consuls in Kerman and Sunder Abbas who are ex-offici o- assistants to the Political Resident at Bushire) in respect of certain ‘ of tI I ?( i I y of their functions, subordinate also, directly or indirectly, to the Government of India, 0 'bviousl 3 r the removal of this system of double responsibility is desirable in theory; but in practice^ as Sir P, Loraine freely admits, the existing anomaly rarely if ever produces any difficulty. But it is in the direction of policy that the disadvantages of dual control (i.e. the necessity that the Government of India and the Secretary of State for I n dia on the one side and His Majesty’s Minister and the Foreign Office on the other should be agreed on any important step before it is taken) are most real; and inasmuch as the existence of Indian interests in Persia will not cease ^ecause the present system of consular representation ^altered, it is to be feared that the delays and difficulties that occur now when decisions of importance affecting Indian interests or sentiment have to be taken, = will still continue to occur. The system of dual control has / as a matter of fact^ largely oeen abandoned by mutmJL though tacit consent in regard to questions of purely British interest (e.g,Anglo Persian Oil Coapi' Imperial Bank of Persia) so long as they do not involve j i any possible liability on Indian Revenues, The appeal j oi the “lesser but still substantialadvantage of reducing to a minimum interdepartmental correspondence on 1 inane ial questions has some cogency: but it ifust surely be admitted that the real disadvantages in tnis sphere^ of the present system, which are felt muen less seriously by officials in Whitehall than 037 the officer in Persia who has to wait for, say, the sanction of a roof over his head while the Government of India^the Secretary of State in Council the £ Li * ~ cMinute Paper. Department I the Foreign Office and the Treasury are 'brought to agree that it is a necessary and not too costly a matter, would “be equally well removed hy the Government of India’s proposal that they should take over &amp; run entirely at their cost certain posts in Persia, while the Foreign Office do the same with the rest. The above points will no doubt occur to the Government of India when they consider the Foreign Office letter and, as it seems desirable ' ' „ ■ to leave them to consider the questions involved with a perfectly open mind, it is not proposed to draw attention to them in inviting an expression of their views. There is one point aJ ^emy mi ne in the Foreign Office letter which is obscure, and which it has not proved possible to clear up by oral enquiry of the Foreign Office, viz.whether it is v proposed to transfer to the Levant Service the Bushire Consulate General. Paragraph 4 speaks of the transference of all posts now held by the Indian Political Department; paragraph 6 seems to exclude Bushire from the proposals in the rest of the letter and indeed to look forward to the maintenance of this post on its present i.e. Indian x scale, which seems to imply the continued incumbencyincumbency of an Indian Political Officer, Sir P.Loraine / in his despatch cited above assumed that there could be no question of transferring Bushire or even Bunder Abbas; the Government of India hold a like view. It may be that the Foreign Office, who are known to be reluctant to mix themselves too closely in the questions affecting the Arabian side of the Gulf handled by the Resident at Bushire, are deliberately obscure in order to avoid a discussion, at the present stage, of the problem which these questions would involve if the Consul General at Bushire were to be separated from jthe Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at ^usiiire. But it is a question which is bound to present itself if the Foreign Office proposals otherwise are accepted; for if all other consular posts in Persia no?/ staffed from India are transferred to the Levant Service, a time will come eventually (not in the very distant future) when the Indian Political Department will not be able to produce any officer qualified for the duties of “Consul General for the Provinces of Fars „ S. L. Khuzistan and Laristan , and the district of Lingah and the Coasts and Islands of the Persian Gulf being within the Dominion of Persia”. The Indian Political Department might perhaps continue to staff the Agencies ac Muscat, . Bahrein and Koweit and so continue to produce a series of officers with experience of Gulf (and especially Arabian - Gulf) affairs; but this experience would be little or no qualification for' the Persian duties performed by the Resident and Consul General, This point , however, may perhaps also be left tu the Government of India to fasten upon without m includes lortli and South AraMsti and Luristan. f includes Bunder Abbas and Minab a the islands of Hormuz Kish#) and Henjam.Mr. Williams. Please see the figures given by the Foreign Office in their letter of 14th July of the division under present arrangements of expenditure in Persia in 1923-4, and compare with those given in your table A put up with my note of 15th May last (flagged in file below)'. The comparison shows Foreign Office .India £ Foreign Office £ Total £ figures 72,000 66,000 138,000 r O0&lt;? S'p &lt; a a o Yours -81,006- £8,-060 138,-660 So far as I am aware yours are right, but you might kindly look into them again. You will see from the Foreign Office letter that they propose to take £ 66,000 as a fixed basis of their contribution wjlile reorganisation is being effected (which is to take a considerable period). The Treasury have possibly said to them 'We don 1 t mind what arrangement you come to with India provided you don*t pay more than at present.' If so and if they have made an error in calculating what their present payment is, they may want to repent. There ought to be no misunderstanding on the point. Of course the Government of India may not like the sugges tedsuggested arrangement and it may not be pursued, but x in any case the point ought to be cleared up. Mr. Sherwood at the Foreign Office could tell us how they arrived at their figures, but perhaps it would_be well for us to consult Mr. tfakely before asking him. In the first place we had better check our own figures. x Please examine also their figure of £53,000 as the amount which would fall to be paid by India under the arrangements which we proposed to them. It does not seem to be right. / - f 'Ll J Itf .

P O Q KQ ■ • ^ Fokeign Office. S.Y.M* 14th July, 1924. Sir, Jr With reference to your letter p. 1258 of March 25th last, and the discussion which took place on the 7th * of May between representatives of the India office, the Treasury and the Foreign Office, I an directed by Mr. Secretary Hamsay MacDonald to request you to lay before the Secretary of State for India, in Council the following proposals relating to the incidence of expenditure upon the Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia. 2. After careful consideration of the situation revealed in the correspondence which has already token place, Mr. Hamsay MacDonald feels that there is little prospect of agreement being reached on the lines of a precise arithmetical formula purporting to represent the magnitude of the respective interests in Persia of the Indian and Imperial Governments. He has accordingly formed the opinion that it is desirable to seek a more concrete and practical method of reducing the financial liabilities of India in this respect. 3. With this object in view the total joint expenditure of the two governments, estimated as one hundred and thirty eight thousand pounds for the year 1923-4, has been examined for the purpose of discovering, if possible, * a means of effecting a substantial reduction of that figure. This examination tends to show, firstly, that there is small •prospect.,.» - *-*. Jnder-Secretary of Stat&lt; India Office. i ; 1 -prospect of achieving the desired result by a process of reducing the cost of individual posts as at present maintained; and, secondly, that the expenditure at posts occupied by officers of the Indian services is greater tha,n it would be if those posts Y/ere held by officers of the Levant consular service. 4, I am accordingly to propose that arrangements be made to replace, as circumstances permit, all officers of the Indian services at Persian posts by officers of the Levant consular service; the entire responsibility for the maintenance of the posts to be assumed by this department and the Government of India to pay to Imperial funds, in full discharge of their financial responsibility for expenditure on the Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia, a yearly contribution which would be considerably less than the Indian share (estimated for 1923-4 as 000. seventy two thousand pounds) of the present joint expenditure, han the share (estiraated for 1923-4 and probably les 000. as fifty three thousand pounds) which would be borne by India under the arrangement proposed in paragraph 17 of your letter of March 7th, 1923. 5. While recognising that this proposal involves great changes, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald believes it to be the only way to effect a substantial reduction of expenditure from Indian revenues without a correspondingly substantial increase of expenditure from Imperial funds, a contingency 1 which he is not prepared to contemplate* He also attaches great importance to the better co-ordination in administration which would result from the abolition of the dual form of control....7,000. ivlfd- control inevitably involved by the present system, and to the lesser, but still substantial, advantage of escaping much inter-departmental correspondence and other work caused by the present arrangements for sharing expenditure. He is 1 very ready to assure the Government of India that, in the event of the change being made, they would have no cause to fear that their special interests in Persia would not continue to be adequately represented by His Majesty’s Kinister at Tehran and the consular officers under his directions. Any suggestion which the Government of India might wish to make to secure this object would be most carefully considered, 6 . The financial effect of the proposed arrangement would have full weight only when all posts in Persia, other than Bushire, had been reorganised on the basis customary in the Levant consular service. In the case of Bushire it is recognised that the special requirements additional to those of this department may necessitate an establishment greater than that of a consulate general on the usual scale. Were this not tne case, i *.• is es uim-ted that the total cost of the services in Persia under the j^^^s.ngement would be in the heighbournood ox ninety seven thousand pounds a year; b ut in order to provide for if) Jr K~f U „ X 84,500. 16,000. Bushire on its present sca.le (the estimated expenditure it that post being three hundred and eighty four thousand hundred rupees for 1923-4, including non-erfective f services) the total expenditure would be one hundred and sixteen thousand pounds a year. 7 . I am accordingly to enquire whether the Government...*. 11’ mp ■i h I !000 • Government of India are prepared to agree to a re-arrangement on the lines suggested above, it being understood that, as from the date when reorganisation is c omple ted, this department v/ould be willing to maintain the entire Diplomatic and Consular establishment in Persia with a contribution from the Government of India of fifty • thousand pounds a year for, (say) the first five years after the new system has come into operation, the amount of the contribution then to be reviewed in the light of then existing conditions, and to be fixed by mutual agreement for a further period of years. 8. • The radical nature of the change i)reposed will inevitably entail the lapse of a, considerable period of time before its financial effect can be fully realised. During the intervening period this department is prepared to agree that the existing arrangement should be superseded by one of a simpler nature which would, moreover, allow India to benefit by economies as they become feasible. On the estimated total expenditure of one hundred and thirty eight thousand pounds for 1923-4 the share of the Imperial Government would amount to sixty six thousand pounds, and it is proposed that the expenditure to be borne by the Imperial Government should remain at that figure until the responsibility for the maintenance of all the posts in \ Persia has been assumed by His Majesty* s Government. The expenditure to be borne by the India Government would 0 iM = therefore be reduced progressively as economies are .effected until, on the completion of reorganisation on the lines % &gt;,OGG. &gt;, 000 . | l'.. I u * 4LM W $ - &gt;,000. proposed above, it would be fixed at fifty thousand pounds. h. t ! i/f tL UJL WwJl? 6~f -&lt;•* J h vg — &amp; AXC During....11.«• * • During the transition period it would he necessary to maintain the present system under which no additional expenditure would he undertaken hy either party without the prior consent of the other. S. Lord Olivier will gather from the foregoing proposals that Mr. Ramsay MacDonald is not able to agree to any suggestion that a change of the existing system should have retrospective force. The proposals now made are, moreover, put forward as a, concrete whole, and should not he regarded as implying the concurrence of this department in a division in similar proportions on any other plan. It mill he understood that, if they are not accepted hy the Government of India, all parties concerned are at liberty to resume the discussion on any basis which may seem good to them. 10 . Finally, I am to point cut that the figures mentioned in this letter are based on those relating to Persia actually contained in the estimates for 1923-4 of expenditure to he shared hy means 0£ the usu^l annual adjustment. They do not therefore include provision for an y expenditure to which this department has expresses objection (e.g. the capital and maintenance charges of the s.s. 'Lawrence'), or which has hitherto been shareo. hy separate aujllstment (viz; that respecting lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf, Indian troops in South Persia, and certain telegraph systeras). In the opinion of the Secretary of state the incidence of expenditure in these latter cases must continue to be discussed separately on their respective merits.11. I am to request thst, if Lord Olivier sees no objection, the views of the Government of India on the suggestions broadly outlined above may be obtained at as early a date as is convenient# Though, in the meantime, it would not appear to be profitable to discuss the proposals in closer detail, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald will of course be happy to furnish his observations on any aspects of the situation in regard to which Kis Lordship may desire further information, I am, Your obedient Servant,I-S’ |wrtrv*v^.f' 3) fc&amp; 'I A ' ■Tv Political Secretary, Please see your reference of 3rd September last Political ,3340.

You will see that under the existing arrarg India is paying (for historical reasons associated with the Webby Commission’s report which I have explained to you orally, and which are set out in «y^hbte of SLth February 1911, copy with Pol♦2891/10,—see also the Annex to Enclosure 2 to Secret Despatch to India 13, 31st March 1911V-about £11,500 a year more than half, and the Foreign Office £11,50*0 a year less, whereas under India's proposals India would pay aboint £8500 a year leas than half and the Foreign Office £8,500 more, a difference of about £20,000 a year in favour of India as compared with the existing arrangements.

Foreign Office, Siu 20tli January 1911. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of tire 16th and 21st ultimo relative to proposed reductions of expenditure on Consular establishments in Persia. I ai p- fo express to you Sir E. Grey’s satisfaction at the economies which it is intended to introduce under this head and his concurrence in the proposal of the Earl of Crewe to inform the Government of India that the reduced scale of charges is approved, and I am at the same time to suggest that further savings might properly be effected by the general adoption of the recommendations made by His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan in the fourth paragraph of his letter of 4th January 1910 to the Government oi India, copy of which is enclosed in your letter of the 21st ultimo. Those recommendations appear to justify the practice followed at the posts which are officered from the Levant Consular Service. _ I am further to observe that in the letter of 20th February 1909 from this Office, in which Sir E. Grey’s views on this subject are fully set forth, the desirability of revising the distribution of Consular posts in Persia between the Levant Consular and Indian services is emphasised equally with the need for a reduction in the existing scale of charges connected with the latter of those services. Sir E. Grey observes, however, that in your two letters under reply only the second of these points is dealt with, and I am accordingly to express the hope that Lord Crewe will give his serious consideration also to the former point which, in Sir E. Grey’s view, is one of great importance. I am to add that the question of the amount to be contributed from Imperial services to the cost of the Intelligence Officer attached to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, referred to in the penultimate paragraph of your letter of the 16th ultimo, is being considered and will form the subject of a subsequent communication. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State Louis Mallet. for India. Enclosure No. 2. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 25th February 1911. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 45,597, dated the 20th January 1911, regarding the reductions of expenditure that have been effected at His Majesty’s Consular establishments at Meshed, Turbat-i-Haidari, and Seistan. In your letter attention is drawn to the desirability of the general adoption of recommendations made by His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan, in favour of a large reduction of the personnel attached to the Persian Consulates. As to this I am to observe that, in regard to Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari, as well as Seistan itself, the recommendations have already been acted on, and it seems reasonable to suppose that the same course will be found to have been followed in regard to Bushire S. 58. !iand the Consulates in the Persian Gulf, when the further report of the Government of India regarding them has been received. In para graph 4 of the letter of the Government of India, dated the 17th November last, the total reductions at Bushire and the Consulates in the Gulf are provisionally stated at about Us. 67,509 (4,46 N.). The observation o£ the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will be borne in mind when the report of the Government of India above referred to is being examined in detail. With reference to the remarks in the latter half of your letter regarding the redistribution of Consular posts in Persia between the Levant and the Indian services, I am to say that the Earl of Crewe has given this subject his most careful consideration, and regrets that he is unable to find himself in agreement with Sir E. Grey. In Sir C. Hardinge’s letter of 20th February 1909, stress is laid upon the effect of the Anglo-Russian Convention in this connection. While far from under-estimating the value of that instrument, Lord Crewe is not convinced by recent events that the time has yet come when Indian interests can be regarded as so securely established vis-a-vis of other Powers that any reasonable precautions can safely be neglected ; and the present moment, when the advent of German competition is threatened in regions which hitherto have largely been supplied by India, and when the construction is contemplated of railways that will touch Indian interests in many vital points, would seem to him to be singularly inopportune for the withdrawal of Indian officers from any posts within the British sphere. As regards Bagdad, I am to' say that in view of the present impossi bility of obtaining for British Indians, even with an Indian officer as Consul-General and Political Resident, the protection enjoyed elsewhere by British subjects, Lord Crewe could not contemplate with equanimity the substitution of an officer of the Levant Service, who, whatever his merits, would, from his experience and training, possess no experience of Indian feelings and customs, while the policy recently followed by His Majesty’s Consul at Basra, of which Sir E. Grey found it necessary to express his disapproval, in connection with Mohammera, furnishes an example of the extent to which even an experienced and able officer of that service may fail to appreciate the wider interests of India and Great Britain in the Persian Gidf. Whether purely British interests would, in the present state of our relations with Turkey, be any better served by a reduction in the establishment of His Majesty’s represen tative at Bagdad is not a question for the Secretary of State for India. But I am to invite attention to the letters on this subject from successive Consuls-General which are already in the posseesion of your Depart ment, and to the information recorded in Mr. Lorimer’s summary for April-May Section IX (7) to the effect that Nazim Pasha had complained to the Turkish Government of the size of the British Residency, and and had recommended that steps be taken to obtain the abolition of the British post office and the removal of the Residency Guard and of the R.I.M.S. Comet. As regards the incidence of expenditure at Bagdad (vide ante penultimate paragraph of Sir Charles Hardinge’s letter above quoted) I am to enclose a memorandum from which it will be seen that, despite the intention of the Agreement of 1900, the effect of that instrument has been to throw on Indian revenues in respect of Persia and Turkish Arabia an excess charge which more than covers the expenditure on the Bagdad Residency. TV hile, therefore, Lord Crewe is not less anxious than Sir E. Grey to reduce expenditure, he is strongly of opinion that in the present conflict of international interests in the middle East this cannot be regarded as the paramount consideration. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, R. Ritchie. Foreign Office.Annex. Memorandum. It has recently been brought to notice that, owing to causes which it is perhaps unnecessary to discuss in this connection, the Agreement of 1900, which was intended to equalise diplomatic and consular expendi ture in Persia and Turkish Arabia as between England and India, left India as a matter of fact to bear unaded a considerable portion of that expenditure. That this is the case can be seen from the following statement of payments and receipts of the two Governments in respect of 1907-08, the latest year in respect of which the accounts have been finally adjusted India. Persia Outlay in Persia Add contribution to Foreign Office in respect of Persia in 1907-08 Deduct refund by Foreign Office in 1909-10 - - Turkish Arabia:— Outlay in Turkish Arabia (not including Koweit) _ _ _ Add contribution to Foreign Office in 1907-08 in in respect of Basra Deduct refund by Foreign Office in 1909-10 in respect of Mr. Gaskin £ 66,832 487 67,319 16,818 5,634 1,400 7,034 43 £ 50,501 Total net expenditure in Persia and Turkish Arabia - - - Foreign Office.

Put differently, it may be said that in effect, and contrary to the intention of the Agreement, the whole of the diplomatic and consular expenditure in Turkish Arabia and a portion (2,402Z. in 1907-08) of that in Persia falls upon India alone. l.v /■■■ Enclosure No. 3.

Mr. Hams ay MacDonald is glad to learn that the Secretary of State for India concurs in the view that the problem of revising in detail the incidence of this expendi ture would probably be more conveniently dealt with by oral discussion than by correspondence, and he therefore regrets that Lord Olivier is unwilling to nominate representatives to enter into a discussion of details on the ground that the letter from this department of January 16th last appears to set aside the principle underlying the proposals put forward by your department and only aims at the removal of the incon veniences and delays of the present system and the reduction of expenditure from Imperial funds. 3. While Mr. Hamsay MacDonald regrets that he is unable to share the view expressed by Lord Olivier that, as the result of 'developments since the year 1900 in which India has little 'or no concern. Imperial interests in Persia, taken as a whole, 'now greatly outweigh Indian,' he has no desire to restrict the proposed inter—departmental conference by any declaration in advance of the principles on which such revision should be discussed, fhe escape from the inconveniences and delays of the present system and the reduction of expenditure irom Imperial/ 2 0 MAR 1924 a Under-Secretary of State, India Office.- 2 - Imperial funds were mentioned as tne objects at wnich this department would aim in the proposed conference.

He considers that the only prospect of either party realising its aims is to meet and discuss the question without restriction. 4. ihe Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s treasury having expressed fheir willingness to nominate a representa tive to represent them at the proposed inter-departmental conference, Mr. Hamsay MacDonald hopes that Lord Olivier will similarly agree to a representative or representatives of his department attending the meeting on the understanding that the whole question will be discussed in all its bearings with a view to an understanding being arrived at. 5. I am to add that, as His Majesty’s Minister at fear an is now on his way home on leave of absence and should reach this country in the latter part ox this month, it is proposed to invite him to attend the conference in order that His Majesty’s Government may be able to avail themselves of his experience of the situation in Persia as it presents itself locally. 6.

Sir, * * 1; ' n S'; I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.!. 8293/2539/ 34 dated 16th January regarding the question of the incidence of ? Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia. In regard to the second paragraph of your letter I am to observe that the contention has not been advanced, either by the Government of India or by the Secretary of State,that Indian interests in •n '■ ■ ■ Persia have declined in the last tv/enty years; on the contrary, it is 4 w distinctly stated in paragraph 7 of my letter of March 7th last, and again at the beginning of the passage quoted at length in paragraph 3 of your letter, that the factors upon which the Welby Commission based their appreciation, over twenty years ago, of India's interests in Persia are, generally speaking, unchanged. The point on which the Government of India and the Secretary of State wish to insist, and whi ch 1 ‘i 6678 5000 9/23 [6440a]which your letter is not understood to question, (it appears indeed to be an unquestionable point of historical fact), is that Imperial interests in Persia, which the Welby Commission adjudged to be similar in nature and equal in extent to those of India, have in the last twenty years developed in new directions quite divergent from India 1 s, and have thus grown to an extent which entirely upsets the pre-existing balance between Indian and Imperial interests. The Secretary of State its the criticism made in paragraph 3 of your letter that India’s political desiderata in Persia were not very appropriately described os 'of modest extent”: bim wnether they are of modest or wide extent is immaterial to tne argument,since India’s polilictl desiderata,in Persia, which may be briefly summarised as prevention of aggression on India by or from Persia, are to an equal extent those of Great Britain as the dominant member of the British Empire. Nor does the Secretary of State seek to irapug^ the general correctnessDraft Paper. Department 6678 of the statements made in the j ilrst part of paragraph 4 of your letter as to the aim of Russian j policy in Persia; he must, however, take exception to certain of the other statements and suggestions in that paragraph. Any hypothetical discussion of the lines that | British Imperial policy might follow [ if India, were not a. part of the British Empire appears to the / Secretary of State to be irrelevant; but he desires to meet the suggestion that, apart from matters concerning India, solely or mainly, the British Empire has little or no concern in Persia. ; Even if it were assumed, for the ; purpose of argument, that the task | of safeguarding India from external menace had ceased to be an Imperial responsibility, Lord Olivier cannot S \ ! believe that British endeavours to combat Russian domination in Persia would be appreciably relaxed, or that the utmost effort would not still be made to safeguard the Bavy’s greatest single supply of oil fuel, and to prevent the establishment in the Persian Gulf of hostile naval bases from which attack could be made on the vital sea-route from 5000 9/23 [6440a] to EuropeEurope to, not India alone, 'but also Ceylon, Singapore, the Pacific and Australia. To sum up; after considering the points adduced in your letter under reply Lord Olivier maintains the position taken 'by his predecessor in my letter of ''arch 7th 1923. It appears to him to he incontestable, firstly, that i is still, as in 1900, at least as mu6h the interest and responsibility of the Imperial Government to prevent external aggression on India as it is India’s interest that such aggression should be prevented; and , secondly, that the other factors (notably the then existing trade interests of the United Kingdom and India) which in 1900 contributed to justify an equal allocation between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government of British interest in Persia, remain generally constant and unchanged in relative importance; but, thirdly, that, as the result of developments since 190C in which India has little or no concern, Imperial interests in Persia taxer, as a whole, now greatly outwei [ :h India's. It appears to Lord Olivier that they may be fairly assessed as standing)raffc Paper. 6678 5000 9/23 [6440a] standing to Indies’s interests in the relation of two to one. (l am to observe, in parenthesi . that unless the Secretary of State for India is misinformed, India alone of all the members of the British Empire assists His Majesty’s Government in meeting the cost of diplomatic and consular arrangements, serving not only her own particular interests but those of the Empire at large). With reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I am to say that the Secretary of State agrees that the problem of revising in detail the incidence of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia would probably be more conveniently dealt with Toy oral discussion than by correspondence/^ ^Ut the first step towards detailed revision mu-st be some agreement as to the broad lines on which such revision is to proceed, and it is impossible for Lord Olivier to nominate representatives to enter into discussion of details on the basis which he understands to be suggested in your letter, viz. that the principle underlying the proposalsproposals put forward this Office is to he set aside, and the only objects aimed at are to he the removal of the inconveniences and delays of the present system and the reduction of expenditure from Imperial funds. The latter .object is, it will he recognised, not one.with which the Secretary of State for India has any direct concern, though it is of course one in the pursuit of which he would he happy to co-operate; and though the former object is desirable from the point of view of India as well as from the point of view of His Majesty's Government it is only a minor consideration, so—frr as Indi-a is ooneernte-eK The first consideration n the point of view of India, and it is one of urgent importance, is that expenditure in Persia should he readjusted on lines that e.re more equi + cole to India. A proposal for such readjustment and the line of argument by wnicn it is supported were set out in my letter of the 7th March 1923, but, as has been pointed out above^the arguments put forward appear^ to have been in a large degree misunderstood or overlooked. Before the matter can usefully be considered further, therefore, Lord Olivier feels that it i necessary to ask for the observafions on6678 5000 9/23 [6440a] to iraft Paper dmft- aJ-trrt % The Under Secretary of State, foreign Office.

In regard to the second paragraph of your letter I am to observe that neither the Government of India , - 4 : r y nor the Secretary of State teecx* snggAhifid that Indian interests m PeiSi£ ! have declined in the last twenty years; I on the contrary, it is distinctly | stated in paragraph 7 of my letter of ■ 5 ! March 7th last and again at the i &gt; &gt; beginning of the passage quoted at -length in paragraph 3 of your letter ; that the factors upon which the Welb 3 r Commission based their appreciation, over twenty years ago, of India’s interests in Persia are, generally speaking, unchanged. The point on which the Government of India and the Secretary of State wish to insist, and which your letter is not understood to question, (it appears indeed to be an unquestionable point of historical fact), but- .~s.eams~~ent 1 roly te— , i s that Imperial interests in Persia, which the Welby Commission adjudged to be similar in nature and equal in extent‘FMi [ / to those of India, have in the laso twenty years developed in new direction auite divergent from India’s, and have thus grown to an extent which ^ upsets the pre-existing balance between Indian and Imperial interests. The Secretary of State admits the criticism made in paragraph 3 of your letter that India’s political desiderata in Persia were not very appropriately described as ”of modest extent”: but whether they are of modes|t or wide extent is immaterial to tne argument, since India’s political desiderata in Persia, which may be briefly summarised as the prevention of aggression on India by or from Persia, to an equal extent those of Great ritain as the dominant member of the British Empire. Nor does the Secretary of State seek to impugn the general correctness of the statements made in the first part of paragraph 4 of your letter as to the aim of Russian policy 'ryuu+j in Persia; he however take .the / ' grave-ai exception to certain of the other statements and suggestions in At**. that paragraph. 11—a p ri 1 f* Xe rT \jF the lines that British Imperial policy might follow if India were not a part of the British ■ p' Empire-; but th^.. a.,r q tary-e-f At,Department fit r fr-&lt;» desires to meet the suggestion that, apart from matters concerning India, solely . or mainly, the British Empire has little or no concern in Persia/. v '•' I—-nro—i ro vdie-thar, - ■■ .iimmicd/that' the task guarding India from !s.*3 menace sSHTrr^tl ceasaf(to Imperial responsibility, nf n ry n f. t, p £jajg„...T?n ^^ 7 -^- &gt;yfOTrI d^'-ge^yttrttrrdy mmy' e British endeavours to combat Russian domination in would beirelaxed, or that the utmost effort would not still be made to safeguard the ilavy ’ s greatest single supply of oil fuel, and to prevent the establishment in the Persian Gulf of hostile naval bases from which attack could be made on the vital sea-route from Europe to, not India alone, but also Ceylon, Singapore, the Pacific and Australia.

I. JV&amp;Q Ay\ ; '17 Sir, Foreign Office. S.W.l. 16th January, 1924. /r it rEpKf I am' directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affakirs to acknov/ledge the receipt of your letter ho, P.2966 of August 14th last, relative to the incidence of expenditure incurred by the Indian and Imperial Governments in Persia. 2. In your letter ho, P.3135 of March 7th 1S23, various considerations were set forth tending to the conclusion, arrived at in the fourteenth paragraph of that letter, that Indian revenues should bear one-third and Imperial revenues two-thirds of such expenditure. The Secretary of state is to his regret unable to share this view of the situation, nor is he able to accept without demur the arguments by which it is sought to show that Indian interests in Persia have so far declined that they no longer equal other imperial interests. 3. In paragraph 11 of the letter of the 7th of March the statement is made that “politically, India has “in Persia., as she had twenty years ago, two essential “requirements, first, that no outside power v/ith “ulterior designs on India should be allowed to “consolidate a position in Persia; and second, that “the Persian provinces bordering on Indianand Afghan “territory should not be allowed to lapse into anarchy. 'To secure these requirements India desires no more 'than that there should be a stable central government in,*,# nder Secretary of State, India Office.Government.«.* ’’in Persia. with sufficient financia,! ”strength to enable her to maintain her national ”integrity and, particularly, to keep up a modicum ” of administrative control of her eastern border”. In a subsequent paragraph the view is eapresed that India’s political desiderata are of ’’modest extent”. It appears to the Secretary of State, however, that the two desiderata referred to above, far from being of modest extent, are so comprehensive as to cover the whole area of British policy in Persia. 4. It must be borne in mind that at the present * time, just as much as twenty years ago, the influence and activity of Russia in Persia, is a factor of prime importance. The policy pursued by the Soviet Government is taking very much the same line as that of the former imperial government. It aims at undermining the authority of the Persian Government, disrupting the Persian Empire, effectively occupying at any rate the northern provinces, developing Russian at the expense of British trade, a.nd opening a route for the free circulation of agents and propaganda to India. The Bolsheviks have openly declared their designs of destroying Great Britain’s position in the East. It- is true that a military invasion of India, by Russia may be ruled out for the present, but it cannot be regarded as impossible in the future. British endeavour in Persia is, therefore, directed towards counter-balancing Russian efforts and preventing the achievement of their aims. If India were not a part of the British Empire, these efforts would probably not be necessary at all and His Majesty’sGovernment could viev/ with comparative equanimity the gradual expansion of Russian power in Persia. India is, therefore, vitally interested in the success of the British mission at Tehran a.nd of every consula-te in Persia. Bolshevik success in any part of the country must shake the authority of the central government, and Bolshevik invasion of the northern provinces, with its threat to the capital, must react unfavourably on Indian interests. Elimination of British influence in north Persia would leave open a corridor for Bolshevik s.gents through central Persia to the Persian Gulf in the south, and to the borders of Baluchistan and Afghanistan to the East. Bolshevik penetration to the Persian Gulf, either through Persia or through Irak, w;ould allow of the establishment of Russian dockyards and submarine bases on the vital sea-route between India and Europe. The second important requirement of the Government of India, that the eastern Persian provinces should not be allowed to lapse into anarchy, is but a part of the first great and vital requirement. 5. While on these grounds the Secretary of State ^is unable to accept the principle underlying the proposals 'll - - ' made in your letter of the 7th March last, he feels that it is imperative to devise some method of sharing expenditure in Persia, which w/ill be free from the serious inconveniences a.nd delays of the present system, a.nd w/nich will promise some reduction in the amount of expenditure from Imperial funds. The question appears to be too complicated and too full of detail to admit oi settlement by correspondence, and I am therefore to suggest, ro* tue consideration.,.•consideration of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that it would best be treated, at any rate in the first instance, by oral discussion between representatives of the India Office, the Foreign Office, and the Treasury. This suggestion is made subject to the concurrence of the Treasury, to whom a copy of this correspondence has been sent* I am to enquire whether Viscount Peel would be willing to nominate representatives for the purpose* I am, Your obedient Servant, CouJ”it D*0-No .756-M. : &gt; r\ e k &lt; V.J KJ ^ 1 ' 'i ' ' X J X X Simla, The iugust 1923.

The Secretary of State for India in Council will readily understand the necessity for the most complete examination of his proposals from the political, administrative and financial points of view. 3. The most recent information at the disposal of this department as to the expenditure incurred by India is that relating to the financial year 1919-20, and the many changes which have occurred since then render the figures for that year of little use as the basis of an estimate of present expenditure; nor, in the opinion of this department, does the average expenditure during the seven years ended March 31st, 1920 convey an accurate impression of the existing position. 4. I am accordingly to request that the Government of India may be asked to furnish, at the earliest possible date, a statement showing the cost of each of the posts in Persia now administered by them for one year on the basis of the actual rate of expenditure which is being incurred at the present moment, the closest possible estimate.. fnder Secret- St India Offic 2 9 iviA CJ *ir-“V 7 estimate -being made of varying expenses such as telegram cnarges, upkeep of buildings, etc. To facilitate comparisons tiie Secretary of State would ask that the statement may uake ohe same lorm as the detailed printed statements •‘.urnished ^ Government of India in connection with une annual adjustment of expenditure in Persia, comparison being shown between the actual expenditure during 1920-1, now presumably known to the Government of India, and that now being incurred, 5, In addition to the usual statement of pension charges which appears as Supplementary Statement D in the annual accounts, I am to request that a separate list may be sent showing the division of the total pension charges now being incurred between the various posts administered by India. 6, On receipt of the information asked for the Secretary of St^te proposed to examine closely the effects of Lord Peel^s proposals, in conjunction with His Majesty’s Treasury, to whom a copy of this letter has been sent, I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, rDraft Paper.

Papers leading up to a request for this statement will be found in the file below, including the telegrams and letters quoted by the Government of India, with the exception of Secretary of State's telegram 4284 of 20th December 1920 of which a copy will be found on sheet C below the Govt.of India's letter. The first five paragraphs of the letter deal with the past, and especially with the very heavy expenditure incurred in Persia and shared by the Govt, of India during the war. The complaint made by the Govt, of India that much of this expenditure was incurred without their being consulted, or even against their advice has not been closely examined in the present connection, and it is doubtful whether it is worth close examination; for apart from the tentative suggestion (which in the present financial stringency has little practical value) that India Revenues might even now be relieved of some part of their moiety of this expenditure, this is a matter of the past and moveover a matter of domestic concern between the Secretary of State in Council and the Government of India, which it is unnecessary and probably not expedient to air before H.M.G. lii is proposed therefore to leave detailed consideration of uhe first five paragraphs aside for the present, taking note however of the stipulation made in para.5 that the recommendations made for future division of expenditure apply s uric tly uo the actual cos t only of the consular and diplomatic establishment that may be maintained, and that any basis of division adopted for this expenditure shall not be held to a PPly so other !f politieal ,T expenditure in Persia. (From paragraph 9 it would appear that the Govt.of India are resolved that so xur as they are concerned there shall be no n other political” expenditure in Persia; but such a resolve could hardlyINCIDENCE OF POLITICAL EXPENDITURE IN PERSIA Note by Mr. Robinson. 1. Since the I olitical Department s reference of IStli August was written I liave bad the advantage of a conference on the subject with Sir Arthur Jlirtzel and the Political Secretary. 1 understand the general position, in Sir Arthur's view, to he somewhat as follows :—- (1) No useful purpose would be served by attempting to re-open the question of incidence in any of the cases detailed in para. 3 of the Government of India’s Despatch. The only practical question now is what is to be done as regards the future. (2; A stable Persia remains a matter of distinct importance to India. The Russian menace may be taken as equivalent to what it was before the war. It has changed its form, but may be taken to be no less strong. Bolshevist agents are being placed at various places in Persia, and Russia under her present rulers may be taken to be just as jealous of Russian interests in Persia as before (3) India ought, therefore, to be prepared to share in political expenditure in Persia as she has done in the past, though possibly not in the same proportions. (4) So far as can be foreseen, such political expenditure in future, apart from rises in salaries and prices, is not likely to be on a materially different scale from that which prevailed before the war. The ordinary “ diplomatic and consular” expenditure will continue, and the possibility of having to afford financial assistance to Persia from time to time in the shape of loans will have to be faced in the future as in the past, though it may be too much to hope that any measures we can take by way of buttressing Persia can result in its regeneration. (5) As regards relative degree of interest, the Government of India are obviously right in thinking that Imperial interests in Persia have grown relatively to Indian interests since the report of the Welby Commission, and that there is a strong case for reducing the Indian fraction to less than one-half. Their suggestion that the new ratio should be “nearer a third than a half” (para. 10 of Despatch) seems reasonable. Indeed we might definitely ask for a general proportion of one-third. (6) In considering what particular arrangement or arrangements ought to be proposed to the Foreign Office with a view to carrying this general principle into effect, Sir Arthur agrees with me that, ceteris paribus, one beneficial to us in the case of future loans is desirable, inasmuch as the regular diplomatic and consular expenditure is ordinarily relatively small compared with the amount of a loan, assuming, as experience teaches us, that our loans to Persia, though otherwise described, are apt to become irrecoverable. For example, the total “ diplomatic and consular” expenditure in 1917-18 (the last year for which we have complete figures of Foreign Office outlay) amounted to 151,500k The difference between one-third and one-half of this sum amounts to only about 25,000£, whereas the difference between the same fractions of a loan of 500,000Z. would be over 80,000Z. On a loan of 1,000,000Z. it would be over 160,000Z. Of course, loans are only granted at intervals, while “ diplomatic and consular ” expenditure is continuous. If we could get a general principle of one-third instead of one-half established for all diplomatic and consular and other political expenditure in Persia to which both parties were agreed, this would automatically secure us in the case of the loans. (Whether it should be stipulated—as the Government of India claim in para. 5 of their Despatch--that in the case of such other political expenditure their previous and express assent must be obtained is a matter for consideration ; normally, I assume, this would be the practice.) 5911 25 11.221 m Sir Arthur thinks, on the other Inu’.d, that the plan proposed by the Govem- ' ineut of India in regard to division ot diplomatic and consular expenditure would urobablv be more acceptable to tbe liKliau Legislature as giviug the Government of India practical control over the consulates nearest to India (thouoh political expenditure is not votable, yet the legislative Assembly will, no doubt, be much interested in it), and it would have the admini strative advantage of rendering previous assent of the Imperial Government in the case of expenditure on these consulates unnecessary, an advantage to which the Political Secretary naturally attaches considerable importance. (8) \n alternative to the present method of staffing the various consulates in Persia would be to place the whole of them under the Poreign Office, who would no doubt, man them from the cheaper Levant Service. The resulting economy would be purchased at the cost of two drawbacks :—(l) Where it, is a question of handling tribes, as is the case on the East side of Persia, officers of the Indian Political Department would probably be better qualified l)v training and experience to carry out the duties successfully; (2) if India is to continue to contribute to the diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia Indian opinion would be ill content to see the withdrawal from India of all the posts at present administered by Indian officers. (9) Sir 1 Arthur agreed with me that whatever new arrangements are made we ^ ^ may confidently expect the Treasury to raise the question of revising the arrano-em cuts made in regard to China and Siam as a result of the recommen dations of the Welby Commission. Sir Arthur considered that this ought not to deter us from making any desirable rearrangement in respect of Persia, but he Miogested that I should investigate the position in regard to China and Siam, especially with reference to what might happen if the Imperial Government were to ask us to apply to them a similar division of expenditure to that which the Government of India are proposing in the case of Persia. Although diplomatic and consular expenditure in China has greatly risen since 1900, and India, through Burma and Tibet, has come into closer geographical touch with China, the opium trade with China, which was the chief reason for India’s contribution towards the diplomatic and consular expenditure in that country, has p ractical]^ ceased to exist. Owing to the increasing naval importance of thtTPacilic, Australia, New Zealand and the Straits Settlements are now perhaps more interested in China than India is. There are no special Indian interests in Siam, although its vest side marc es with Burma, so long as there is no interference from France on the east or north. I promised also to look into the question of British and Indian tiaue with Persia. II. 2.

X The miesfion whether India should share in diplomatic, consular, and general political expenditure in Persia, and, if so to what extent must depend mainly on military and political considerations, and the views of the M.l.tar Department w,l ' ,| im |, t i ie y vl oht .My personal views have hitherto coincided with those expressed 1 iy Mr. Chamberlain in'his note of 22nd June 1916 on P. 3S39/16, and l am not aware of any reason for changing them except as legaids the piopoition of chaigeto be borne bv'fmlia, which I agree ought now to be reduced m view of he appearance of new British interests associated with the mandate for Jiak and with the leisian oil-fields Despite the hostility of the Government ot India to our action m sharing general political expenditure in Persia during the war period, particularly in the case of the South Persia Rifles, I venture with deference to remain of opinion that we were right. From a financial point of view our expenditure m lersia is an insurance premium, and we had undoubtedly to pay a greatly increased one during the war to cover the war risks. The question ,s whether it has been too big Th, of course a matter of opinion, on which the views of those fully acT'amted wlh he governing military and political conditions may d liter; but a fact that 1 with me is that military operations either in Persia or Afghanistan have recently be demonstrated to be extremely costly (the military expenditure in Eas Pern associated with the Malleson .Mission during the war, which lias been vhoU boi^ by the War Office, but which they want us to share, came o ov e' ’ ’ , G j[ the few months’ operations against the Afghans m 1919 cost ’ ls - ■ ■ i ,j our total political expenditure in Persia during the war of some b,000 bW • ^ us from a very much greater Afghan expenditure, or from pel raps w . , our frontier, the money has been well spent.

As regards the future, I share Sir Arthur Hirtzel s views, and that we should endeavour to persuade the Imperial Goveminen ” 0 . eiie ral diplomatic and consular and other political expenditure in lersia shoui.,* ^ principle, be shared on a basis of two-thirds Imperial Goveinme India, subject to the following provisos i i . n Xl) enditure (a) India to bear the whole of the ordinary diplomatic and eonsu ar p )Un( ] e r of the present Eastern Consulates (Meshed, Seistan, vel1 ^ . t j ]e gall] e Abbas), or of any others that might be established heiea area.(b) India to bear one-third of the ordinary diplomatic and consular expenditure ^ on the Legation at Tehran and on the Consulate at Bushire. -(e) 1 he Imperial Covernment. to bear two-thirds of the ordinary diplomatic and consular expenditure referred to, in (T). (d) The Imperial Covernment to bear the whole cost of the ordinary diplomatic and consular expenditure at any consulates in Persia other than those mentioned in (a) and (6). (e) India to have complete control of expenditure at the consulates referred to in (a); the Imperial Covernment to have complete control of expenditure at those mentioned in (&lt;/), although in the ordinary course of business the one Government may find it desirable to consult the other, or to give information, as to any important measures taken. (/) As India is to bear a share of the expenditure on the Legation at Tehran and on the Consulate at Bushire, the assent of the Government of India to be obtained to important measures of new expenditure proposed to be incurred at these places. (g) No liability to rest on India in respect of political expenditure, as distinguished from diplomatic and consular expenditure, unless there has been obtained the previous and express assent to it of the Secretary of State in, Council, who in such matters would ordinarily consult the Government of India. 10. A revision of the present arrangements in regard to the incidence of expenditure in Persia, though it will leave us open to a claim for increased contributions 1 by India towards the diplomatic and consular expenditure of the Foreign Office in China and Siam (paras'. (5 and 7 above), will incidentally relieve us of the loss, amounting to some G,OOOL a year (half of 12,000Z), arising out of the circumstances, mainly connected with the Wei by sett lement, which I set forth in a printed note of Dll (F. 5182/15, attached). 1 China Siam At present £ ■ 12,500 P 2,000 Possible ('laim. £ say, 20,000 say, 10,000 11. As the Government of India point out in para. 12 of their Despatch, the financial effect of the arrangement they propose in Persia, though less favourable to India than an all-round one-third and two-thirds arrangement, would represent an important saving on the present half-and-half arrangement. Mr. Hopkins has prepared statements (Appendix III.) of ordinary diplomatic and consulate expen diture in Persia from which the following comparative table may be deduced as to India’s liability during the years 1913-14 to 1917-18 (the latest for which we have complete figures) :— ..

If the arrangements as to incidence of expenditure in Persia are revised ought opportunity to be taken to alter the present arrangements in regard to certain consulates elsewhere, the whole cost of which is borne by India (e.g., Muscat, Bahrein, Kashgar) r 13. With reference to para. 3 of the Government of India’s Despatch one might observe that the Welby Commission were hardly concerned with the question of the actual authority that would speak in the name of the “ Government of India,” a domestic matter as between the Secretary of State and that Government. 14. I agree with the Political Department that there is no good in attempting to recover from the Treasury any portion of the sums we have paid under arrangements with them in the past.15 Witli reference to our conversation w ith bin A. llirtzel I am inclined to think, on reconsideration, that in view of the very precise expression of opinion at the end of para. 5 of the Government of Ihdias Despatch, a telegram to them on the subject of their future attitude towards political expenditure m Persia outside the ordinary diplomatic and consular expenditure will not elicit very much in addition to what they have said. 10. The question of the date from which any new arrangement should have effect would be for consideration. I am afraid we do not stand much chance of obtaining any retrospectivity, though it is true that 1917-18 is the latest year in respect of which expenditure has been adjusted oi is in piocess of adjustment-—on the present lines. 17. The treatment of the frills of expenditure mentioned in para. 13 of the Despatch will require consideration.

Arrangements in regard to Bahrein will probably have to be altered, but that problem will presumably form part of the problem of une future responsibility (financia.1 and administrative) io?, tne Persian G-ull. The same applies to Muscat, tncugn there is less obvious need tor a re•arrangement there. Kashgar stands on rather a special footing and any alteration would be difficult to iustifv ve may penaps leave the Government of India to suggest it* The financial aspect of the disposal of the Merjawa-Dusdab Railway is a special and peculiar problem which it would seem best to keep separate irorn that oi the incidence of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia. The question of a consequential re-adjustment of shares in the cost of representation in China and Siam will no doubt be raised bv the Treasury; but nrjma-faci e it would seem desirable^ if Persian expenditure is to be de novo and on the merits, to secure if possible similar treatment of the China and Siam questions. As 5479—1 3000 6.22 . k *As regards paragraph 16, the letter of 2nd July 1919 seems to afford reasonable ground for claiming retrospective effect of the re-adjustment proposed ’to August 1919, and a reservation in this sense has been inserted in the draft: but it will very probably have to be given up later on. The draft embodies so far as possible the arguments, and in the case of some passages, the j jQsissima versa oi the Government ol India* But it has been found, in adopting the language of the despatch to the purpose of a letter to the Foreign Office,that some of the arguments are not from India’s standpoint and that some are anced in a form that veils animadversions on the Secretary of State for India rather than His Majesty’s Government as a whole: points that are good against the Secretary of State in Council would be lost on, or even weaken the Indian case before, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. The last paragraph of the draft is submitted with considerable diffidence, though it seems not out of place to make covert allusion to the fact that the British Government is unable to convince the Dominions of their share of interest in, say, the British position in Aden and their consequential obligations in the matter of its cost; and to suggest that it is invidious to fling a stone at the Government of India if they find it an uphill task to convince the Indian Legislature of India’s less obvious interests in Persia. It^ A ' ii! I military side (section II para.7, for example, of the draft). (2) Iraq. Of the various changes since 1900 which have operated to increase the interest in Persia of the British ; Government relatively to that of the Government of India, is not the most important the 'emergence of Iraq as a 3tate under British mandate' (section II, para.lO of the draft)? If this be so, would it not be as well to put it in the forfront of the picture’ I have ventured to suggest a j position in paragraph 1 of Section II, The alteration would of course necessitate some consequential redrawing of the other details of the picture. I make the suggestion for your consideration. (3) Afghanistan . A factor which might perhaps be mentioned in the draft is the greater degree of independence given to Afghanistan since 1900, with the result that Persia is to some extent less a neighbour to India, than she then was. not know whether you would regard this as worthy of ion, but the general conception of our argument, I take it, is that India’s contact with Persia has become less intimate, England’s much more intimate, than in 1900. (4) Retro sTfectivitv. Please see pencil suggestion in para.3, Section III of draft.

The Under Secretary of State, 7 MAH U23 FOHSKxil OFFICE, Sir, 4 I am directed to invite a ittached for facility of 'ence. reference to Sir A,Hlrtzel T s letter of 2nd July 1919 P, 3292*, in which the Secretary of State for India in Council made it a condition of his acceptance as a charge on Indian Revenues of a moiety of the projected loan of £2000,OOC to the Persian GrOvernment, that the whole question of the incidence on Indian and Imperial Copy to t ft MKR U2S Revenues of expenditure in Persia / should be re-examined at the earliest!^ possible date. ’/In conformity with this stipulati on,which , it is under stood, was accepted by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, the question has been examined with great care by the government of India, who r '10¥E0 Q0UMS1L ’ have closely scrutinised expenditure in Persia in which Indian Revenues | ' 6 KAR1923 (k&gt; have been concerned since 1915. It is not proposed, at this stage at any rate, to follow the Government of India in their detailed review of these various items of expenditure (though the Secretary of State reserves his right to claim, in 3413—2 3000 2/21 accordance 3413—2accordance with the terms of the stipulation referred uo above, the application thereto?of such revision of Persian oecpenditure in general as may he agreed to); but from this review the (government of India draw one general conclusion, in which Viscou /s Peel concurs, and in which he invites the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Ihe Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. This conclusion is that the adoption for general application throughout Persia of any rule of ! Proportional division, such as the half half rule hitherto applicable to iplomatic and consular expenditure, j| is liable to give rise to misunder- - jj standing and unfairness, by reason of j zhe na toal tendency to assume that ! rii:ie is equally applicable also to expenditure outside the limited scope I J::3;r w bich i G may have been devised, j -^-be system on which expenditure in J iQrs i-a bas been debited as between the !

It is, |'in our opinion, desirable to adopt a j 'general principle of division which ' d willDepartment will put an end to these discussions * Both countries have admittedly &amp; large interest in Persia, and we thinic that the charges of the 'Mission and Consulates should be ''evenly divided between the two 'countries, ye thinh, also, tha.t 'the British Foreign Office should not create or add to the 'establishments and services under 'its control without the consent of the Covernment of India, and vice ' versa , that the Government of India should not add to the establishments and services under their control without the consent of the Foreign Office, lastly, V the charge as made up for division .^should be complete, including outfits, pensions, and all arrived at by which neither Govern ment need mahe a reference to the - other before incurring fresh expendi ture not exceeding £100 a year in the case of salaries or £100 in the case of unusual items under the head of Contingencies; but this arrhn geme n g was applicable strictly within the limitsnr limits of the basic arrangement | recommended by the Weloy Coiomiooion, j bhat is to say, both the basic arrange ment and the subordinate working arrange ment for division were intended to l apply only to the charges involved in maintaining the Diplomatic and Consular establishments in Persia. At the date of the Weiby Commission expenditure in Persia was^-e^mpri-s-e-d— entirely in-these charges; but shortly afterwards (the first notable instance is the Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903-4) British policy in Persia began) to involve expenditure which ough no doubt iwelrl described as c ,n /i. ’’political” was o— a n^tui i e far other I ; f\ Ac ^ contemplated by the Welby H ' Commission. The practice grew up, however, of dividing such expenditure, loans, advances, and generally all s ' disbursements of a not purely military nature, equally between the Indian and Imperial Governments, by extension of the scope of the Commission’s (-A-ffp * j recommendations. However/wedl this practice umy-havo boon- in the first years of its adoption, k/L. its culmination, coinciding of course, with the culmination of such ’’political!' expenditure during the War and the years immediately following, has led tq the debiting of Indian Revenues with a moiety of very large items of expenditure, in the specific objects of The expenditure of Indian Revei on military operations outsidi India is governed by Statute,Department o': some of which India has been little concerned, and which it is difficult to bring within the provision of the Government of India Act that the revenues of India ‘ 'shall be applied for the purposes of the government of India alone'. ^The Government of India, as will be seen below, now propose an alternative arrangement^ under which the principle of proportional division will actually be directly applied only in a few special cases; butl in any event they desire it to be clearly understood that whatever formula, may j. be adopted for the future I 1 i distribution of the cost of Diplomatic and Consular representation in * Persia(i.e. the maintenance of the Legation and Consulates and the | usual contingent expenditure on these establishments^ it shall be strictly interpreted as applying to this expenditure only; and that the incidence of 'political' expenditure, outside the limit of the cost of Diplomatic and Consular representation ? t * shall be considered on the merits in Stale for India in Council agrees with u the Government of India that the clearestclearest possible under- standing on this point is desirable. has been stated above^ uhe recommendation of the V/elby Commission T;as Ghat Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia should be shared eoual ly by the Indian and Imperial Grovernments, whocso interests in tne country had till then been common and, so far as apportionment is possible, equal, centring as ohey - A f during the century preceding the date C fc, ^ &lt;Al . n C &lt;-k ^ 'v I ^ c j^ ^ h’y^L, ^v«., the Commission^firstly^ in the maintenance of British influence in Persia as forming ultimately a means of defending Gt.Britain's position in India against possible attack from or through Persia, and, secondly, in the protection and encouragement of Persia import and export urade with Gt.Britai and India. w ^ ^ K^( ^ &lt; /it l&amp;^sometimes^ta ied &gt;iideed- that fof Persia's import and export^ 'trade./fndia has the major portion as A compared with Gt.Britain.

Generally speaking, an examination of the Trade Returns for the last £&amp; years indicates that India’s interest in trade with Persia was and is little, if at all, greater than that of the United Kingdom and that such small excess as there may be is counter-balanced by the fact that practically all the sea-borne trade between Indish and Persia (as well as that between the United kingdom and Persiai n rmm I If 1 Psrsisi) is carried in British tionnagei a facu that its special significance , in regard to the comparative interest.s of iihe two Governments in the two a mere Sovornraents in the Persian Gul: . ^ It appears then that the factors which led the Welhy Commission to recommend an equal division of expenditure in Persia remain unchanged; for it will not be denied that the defence of the British position in India, so far as this can be attained by political action in Persia, is no less a matter of concern to Gt.Britain now than it was twenty years ago. But during these twenty years have grown up in Persia other interests, important and substantial in themselves,which have to be safeguarded and promoted for their own sake. All, or practically all; are exclusively British in character and have little or no Indian element in their constitution. The branch offices of the Imperial Bank of Persia may incidentally assist, in some degree, the operations of Indian traders in Persia, but it is in itself a corporation exclusively British; in the Liesopotamia-Persia Trading Corporation,.the Persian Railways Syndicate, and other concessionaire syndicates India has V Pi little or no share } direct or indirect.

But none of the enterprises i mentioned /so clearly) illustrate^the | present disparity of India 1 s and Gt. 3ritain T s interests in Bsrisaa/' as does r the case of the Anglo-Persian' Gil Coy !

I But to Gt.Britain,/ the Company and the security of its oil fields and refineries a are a matter of prime importance. Apart from the fact, itself of no small | weight, that the British Government has a very considerable financial investment in the Company, yielding an annual return of half a million sterling and more and must derive a large additional sum annually from the Company by taxation, it is understood that the Bavy depends \ for a very considerable portion ^ ab outabouu 45 ^of las fuel, supply on vhe oil fields and refineries. Even if Uhe possibility is set aiside that the Anglo-persian Oil Coy. te— 'oy—may acquire in Northern Persia also sources of supply of similar importance to the British Navy, the Company already constitutes a British interest of an intrinsic importance far exceeding any that India can be held to possess in Persia, and of a nature that obviously has strategical implications of the gravest concern. It appears to Viscount Peel that it is not too much to say that^if Ct.Britain T s interest in Persia in connection with the safeguarding of India could be entirely eliminated, ti.oj necessity would .still exist to an 'Tindiminished degree for His Majesty T s Government actively to interest itself in Persia and the Persian Gulf, for the protection of the Anglo-Persian Oil Coy oil-rields pipe-line and refineries and the sea-routes constituting the outlet for the supply of fuel oil to the Navy. / 0 ^ jle ex 3. 3 1 enoe of so important an asset in South-Vest Persia would inevit ably and in any circumstances necessitate close attention on the part of His Majesty T s Government to the country co-terminous with that part of Persia: but the emergence of Iraq as a Btci.ut .uncier British mandate gives a new colour to this aspect of the Giuestion* tC) ' ::he necessity of safeguarding interestsDepartment . intereslis in Persia from the direction 0 -^ Iraq adds tne necessity of protect— | ing the interests of Iraq in Persia. ! I1 * creates an additional political factor of great weight on the side of i Imp erial Interests in Persia,, but of no counterbalancing interest to India. //, Politically India has In Persia, as she had twenty years ago, two ! essential requirements, first, that no outside Power with ulterior designs (nn i India should be allowed to consolidate ! a position in Persia; and second, that the Persia provinces bordering on ■ ! Indian and Afghan territory should not | be allowed to lapse into anarchy. To | secure these requirements India desires no more than that there should be a stable central Government in Persia, definitely Anglo-phil for preference, hut not necessarily sop-with sufficient financial strength to enable her to maintain her national integrity and ; particularly ( to heep up a modicum of adminisirative control of her eastern border. The lat :er point is emphasized not only because^ at the present time^ a danger to India admittedly exists In the facilities which anarchy and discontent in Eastern Persia might furnish for the infiltration into India of seditious propaganda and prupagandists; ^tbe/permanent memceto India in tihio quarter ia the possibility of disorder within the Persian frontier reacting on Baluchistan and Afghanistan ; with consequences, in the latter case especially, of the widest potentiality. 12. India's political desiderata in Persia then are of modest extent. / ' It may be said that they are not less now than they were twenty years ago; but whereas these were, ahcf indeed still must be, sought by the Imperial Government in defence of Gt.Britain's position in India no less than by India in her own defence, the Imperial Government has now^as a consequence of Gt.Britain's new position in the territory of Persia's western heighb ouj)* new political desiderata , of a similar character, in which however India has c oncern. 3 .

' U c lovernment. In His Lordship T s view/the suggested ratio 7 so far from indicating an under-estimate of India , sshare[in .an - queotions, is open to criticism as being over-generous to the Imperial Government at India’s expense. K But the Government of India do |j‘not recommend that the present practice dividing all Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia, in definite ^proportions should be maintained, the proportions merely being altered- as above suggested.

Simla, the 13th July 1922. Incidence of expenditure in Persia. My Lord, In Lis telegram No. 3860, dated the 7th December 1920, your predecessor asked us to submit any suggestions we might have to offer for the revision of expen diture in Persia as between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers, and in a subsequent telegram No. 4284, dated the 24th December 1920, he emphasized the necessity of our placing him in possession of a definite and reasoned statement of our views as to the extent of the interests of India in Persia. We much regret the delay that has occurred in forwarding our views on this subject. In the course of our considera tion of the question we were led into an examination of the expenditure which had been debited against Indian revenues on account of Persia from the year 1915-16 onwards. Including sums which may be held to be recoverable from the Persian Government, this expenditure has amounted in all to over 6 million pounds. We have had great difficulty in tracing many of the items ; references to the details of expenditure were scattered over a large number of different communications, and we were, indeed, not in possession of complete figures of expenditure until we received, as the result of inquiries made by us, the figures forwarded to us demi-officially in letters, dated the 30th September 1919 and 29th of July 1920, addressed to our Secretary in the Finance Department. These figures were further brought up to date in a further demi-official letter to the same address, dated the 6 th October 1921. We have now completed our examination of the figures, and are in a position to furnish you with the views for which your predecessor asked. 2 . The system on which Persian expenditure has been debited as between the Indian and Imperial Governments during the last 20 years is based on the recom mendation contained in paragraph 242 of the Welby Commission’s report. We quote, for facility of reference, the relevant passage :— The two Governments are not agreed as to the extent of their respective interests in Persia. It is, in our opinion, desirable to adopt a general principle of division which will put an end to these discussions. Both countries have admittedly a large interest in Persia, and wethink that the charges of the Mission and Consulates should he evenly divided between the two countries. We think, also, that the British Foreign Office should not create or add to the establishments and services under its control without the consent of the Government of India, and vice versa, that the Government of India should not add to the establishments and services under their control without the consent of the Foreign Office. Lastly, the charge as made up for division should be complete, including outfits, pensions, and all contingencies, to which the Government of India sometimes demurs.” Subsequent to the issue of the report, a working arrangement was arrived at under which references were not made to either government when the sum involved was less than £100. But even before the War the principle of division was extended beyond “ Diplomatic and Consular ” expenditure, pure and simple, and was applied to outlay of various kinds intended for the furtherance of the stability of Persia, as for example, the Anglo-Indian loan of 1903-04. It would appear from papers forwarded to us that the question whether expenditure other than that coming definitely under the head of “ Diplomatic and Consular” was strictly governed by the Welby Commission’s report, was considered by Mr. Chamberlain in June 1916 in connection with a proposed Anglo-Bussian loan to Persia; we note that the view then taken by him was that it was of primary importance to India that Persia should be sufficiently well-governed to prevent her from becom ing a danger to India through Afghanistan, and that a half share of the expenditure necessary to maintain a stable government in Persia could therefore justifiably be debited to India. In regard to the employment of Indian troops in Persia during the war, the Treasury agreed to depart from the “ half-and-half ” principle, the whole of the extraordinary outlay being charged to the Imperial Government. This, however, was not a special concession in regard to Persia, but was in accordance with the procedure adopted in other theatres, where India, under the sanction of the Parliamentary Resolutions, bore only the normal cost of maintaining her troop, anything beyond this being defrayed by the Imperial Government. Expenditure coming under the head i: Loans and Subsidies ’ was in practice shared in moieties. A difference of opinion having arisen in 1917 regarding expenditure classed as ‘ Secret Service,’ a formal discussion took place between the India Office and the Foreign Office, and it was agreed that such expenditure as concerned ‘ Secret Service for military purposes ’ should be debited solely to His Majesty’s Government who also undertook, on the same- principle, to bear the whole cost of the Sistan and Sarhadi levies, these being held to be military in their nature. As to general political expenditure, His Majesty’s Government further agreed to the half-and-half rule. We state these facts as embodying the only information at our disposal regard ing the principles on which India was debited with Persian expenditure during the war. We, were not ourselves consulted regarding the principle of division adopted, and, as already explained, we did not receive until a comparative ly late date information regarding numerous items of expenditure debited to our accounts. 3. We are constrained to say that it wouldin our opinion have been more strictly in accordance with the spirit of the recommendations of the Welby Commission had we been given an opportunity of discussing both the principle and detail of the expenditure debited to Indian revenues from 1916 onwards in accordance with3 these decisions. For facility of reference we reproduce in an Appendix a list of these items as revised up to date, and proceed to comment on some of them in the light of the remarks just made. We shall for the present purpose draw no distinc tion between items which have been held to be recoverable from Persia, and those which are not so classified. Even if recovery is ultimately made, the payment will in the meantime have imposed a severe strain on our resources and materially affected our revenue position Item No. 1 (a).—We were debited in 1915-16 with a sum of £7,500 as a moiety of the compensation given to the Far man Far ma for destruction of his property by the Nationalist Party. We were not consulted on this proposal. - Item No. 1 ( 6 ).—We were not consulted with regard to the payment of sub sidies to the Farman Farma, which commenced in 1916, True, in 1919 we supported a proposal for one particular payment to him, but this was for a specific purpose, ^., the maintenance of the guards on the northern road, and we urged the need for an early curtailment of our liabilities on this account. The actual payments made to him were for many purposes other than the maintenance of the road guards and we were debited with a total of £48,483 as a subsidy to the Farman Farma in 1916-17 ; £39,142 in 1917-18; £23,677 in 1918-19; £15,707 in 1919-20, and £1,837 in 1920-21. Items No. 2 {a\ and 2 ( 6 ).—We were consulted regarding the comparatively small payments to the Sardars Jung and Bahadur but were not consulted regarding the large sums paid to Bakhtiari Khans in 1915-16—of which the moiety debited to us amounted to £17,000. These payments were made mainly in the interests of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company towards which as has since been recognized by the India Office—mde Secretary* Political Department’s letter No. P-5661, dated the 12 th January 1922, to our Secretary in the Foreign and Political Department-—we have no kind of obligation. Item No^ 2 [d ).—The subsidy to Sardar Zafarwas sanctioned without refer ence to us ; the amounts debited to India were £1,082 in 1918-19 and £93 in 1919-20. Item No. 3 (a).—No reference was made to us regarding the cost of the re moval from Meshed to Shahrud of the Cossack Division, for which we were debited with £1,525 in 1918-19. Item No. 3 ( 6 ).—In regard to the general expenses of the Cossack Division, we would note that we deprecated the financing of the Cossack Division, but stated that, if the proposals for further finance were adopted, the incidence would depend on the decision regarding the so- called political expenditure in Persia. We had previously expressed the opinion that this expenditure should not be shared by India, as being outside the scope of the Government of India Act and the Parliamentary Kesolutions regarding India’s financial liabilities during the war. The decision adopted, however, was to finance the force, and India was debited with £258,592 in 1918-19, £176,840 in 1919-20, and £271,525 in 1920-21. We still feel the greatest difficulty in comprehending how this expenditure on a force intended to co operate with the Norperforce based on Mesopotamia could be brought within the terms of the Besolutions of Parliament or the Government of India Act. C73J?DItem No. 6. —We make no comment with regard to this on the understand ing that the charge against us has been withdrawn. Items No. 7 and 8(a) and (c). —In regard to the subsidy to Kawam-ul-Mulk and Soulet for restoration of order in Fars we were consulted and agreed to bear a moiety of the expenditure. The same is the case with regard to the expenditure incurred on the Kashgai rising and the liabilities incurred by the Consul at Shiraz in this connection. Item No. 9. —We have no details regarding the sum of £3,947 with which we were debited in 1917-18 under the head of “ Subsidy to Persian Government.” Items No. 12 (a), (b) and(c). —We were consulted on, and agreed to, the expenditure on relief measures at Shiraz, for which we were debited with £6,230 in 1917-18 and £2,631 in 1918-19, but were not apparent ly consulted in regard to the expenditure on relief measures at Tehran for which we were debited with £5,154 in 1918. The same is the case with regard to the expenditure on relief measures at Hamadan in connection with which we were debited with £18,951 in 1918-19 and £1,743 in 1920-21. Item No. 13 .—We deprecated the proposal to finance Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who subsequently headed the Kashgai rising. We were, however, debited with a sum of £8,406 as our moiety of the subsidy given in 1917-18. Item No. 11. —A reference was made to’us on the proposal to make certain payments to the Shah, on condition that he supported the Cabinet of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh. We protested against the policy generally, but agreed that, if the proposals formulated were adopted, the incidence of their cost should follow that of the so-called political expenditure in Persia. We were, however, debited with a sum of £12,885 in 1918-19, £33,101 in 1919-20 and £14,275 in 1920-21. Item No. 15 .—If we are correct, no reference was made to us before a payment was made to the late Zill-es-Sultan in order to allow him to take up the appointment of Governor General of Ispahan. We were, however, debited with an expenditure of £3,558 on this account in 1917-18. Item No. 16 (a). —We were consulted regarding the expenditure of Secret Service money by the Minister at Tehran and intimated that we were not in a position to pass an opinion on the possible effect of the financial proposals made by the Minister. We were, however, debited with a sum of £28,000 in 1915-16, £22,500 in 1916-17, £12,500 in 1917-18, £32,500 in 1918-19, £5,000 in 1919-20, and £10,000 in 1920-21. Item No. 16 (b). —We cannot trace any papers regarding payments made to Yossuk-ed-Dowleh in 1918-19, but were debited with £ 5,100 in 1918-19 and £4,250 in 1919-20 on this account. . Item No. 17. —We were fully consulted regarding the proposals which led up to the payments described under the head Moratorium, and though w;e thought the terms at first proposed by Persia to be prohibitive f lie ha 1 ®&gt;ia for t ^toprand preposterous, we agreed in June 1916 that we were prepared to pay the usual share if His Majesty’s Government were satisfied as to the necessity of this subsidy for the maintenance of a friendly and effective Persian government, but we expressed our dissatisfaction both with the policy and with the Persian Government that it pro duced. The sums debited to us as our share of the moratorium were £112,500 in 1915-16, £90,000 in 1916-17, £15,983 in 1917-18, £264,380 in 1918-19, £778,915 in 1919-20, and £795,900 in 1920-21. Item No. JP—The proposal for a joint loan of two million sterling to the Persian Government was referred to us for our opinion, and it is only necessary to note here that the Government of India consistently opposed the contemplated Anglo-Persian agreement, both on princi ple and on grounds of expediency. With reference to the financial aspect of the agreement we stated that 4 we need say nothing beyond repeating that it will be our duty to resist strenuously the extension of the financial commitments of India.’ It was, however, decided that India should share in the loan to Persia, and, although the agree ment was not ratified and the loan therefore fell to the ground, we were debited in 1919-20 with a sum of £65,573. This, we under stand, was a payment made to Vossuk-ed-Dowleh in order to secure his good services in regard to the agreement. Item No. 20 .—In view of the full correspondence which took place with your predecessor on the subject of the financing of the South Persia Kifles, it is unnecessary for us to refer at any length here to this expenditure. The last statement of our case was conveyed in our despatch No. 55, dated the 13th February 1920. We may be pardoned for saying here that in our opinion the objections of India to the payments on account of the South Persia Rifles were not stated as fully as we could have desired, when the question of the legality of these payments was referred for legal opinion. In any case, however, that opinion merely amounted to a statement that the question whether this expenditure was in its essence military expenditure was really a question of fact, upon which the legal adviser himself was hardly competent to express an opinion. We must reiterate our regret that, in spite of our protests, it was decided to treat this expenditure as other than military, with the result that India has been debited wdth over three and-a-half million pounds. 4. We have made these references to individual items of expenditure incurred in Persia for two reasons. In the first place, we consider it our duty, even at this late date, to protest against certain of these payments being admitted as a final debit against Indian revenues. We were at one time hopeful of finding some common |ormula which we could commend to you as suitable for adoption in reviewing the whole of the Persian expenditure debited against us during the war years, with a view to its redistribution on a more suitable basis. In this, however, we have not succeeded. The multifarious nature of the items, and the fact that we have ourselves admitted in more than one case that our interests justified our taking a share in the expenditure, seem to render it impossible to arrive at any general principle of revision, and we consider that the items must be considered on their own merits. We have, of course, no desire to reopen the question regarding expenditureto which we had already agreed, nor do we wish to discuss here any item of minof import. There are, however, some items in regard to which we feel strongly that we ought to be relieved of all liability. These are the payments on account of the Cossack Division (No. 3) ; the payment to Soulet-ed-Dowleh (No. 13); the subsidy to the Shah (No. 14) ; the payment to Vossuk-ed~Dowleh (No. 16 (6)J ; the special expenditure in connection with the loan of 1920 (No. 19) ; and the payment on account of the South Persia Rifles (No. 20). It will be observed that some of these payments extended beyond 1918-19 and they could not therefore even be described as made in furtherance of the objects connected with the war. The heavy pay ments made on account of Persia have more than once formed the subject of adverse criticism in India, and we should find the greatest difficulty even in pretending to justify the particular expenditure to which we have referred, were it made the subject of detailed interpellation by the Legislature. 5. In the second place, we think that the figures we have quoted illustrate the grave danger to our finances involved in an understanding that expenditure of any particular type shall be divided on any rule of proportions. It is clear that when an emergency arises, such understanding affords an argument for extending the principle of division into a sphere not contemplated by the original agreement, It is as a consequence of the existence of an agreement of this nature that we have in the past years been debited with large sums, sometimes in furtherance of a policy to which we were definitely opposed, and on other occasions without even being allowed an opportunity of expressing an opinion on the expenditure, We shall return subsequently to the system which we now propose should be followed in regulating the division of expenditure as between the Indian and the Imperial Ex chequers. But we desire to make one preliminary remark. It is useless to devise any new formula of distribution, unless we can obtain some guarantee that the latter will be strictly interpreted, and that, wherever it is found necessary to go beyond a strict interpretation, the previous consent of the Government of India is obtain ed. Political expenditure is not subject to the vote of the Legislature, but it is, in practice, open to interpellation and discussion, and you will, we trust, concede’ that it is unreasonable to ask us to justify to the Assembly expenditure about the propriety of which we have not been convinced or even consulted. We do not overlook the statutory powers of the Secretary of State in Council in regard to expenditure from the revenues of India, but we are convinced that it will not be possible to place expenditure of this nature (which is not strictly concerned with the governance of India itself) on a satisfactory basis, until it is definitely agreed that no fresh expenditure on Persia, and in particular no expenditure that goes beyond the strictest definition of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure—the upkeep of the legation and consulates and the usual contingent expenditure thereon—shall be debited against India without the previous and express assent of the Government of India. 6 . W e turn now to consider the present extent of India’s interests in Persia in order to arrive at a decision as to the principle on which expenditure should in future be divided between India and the Imperial Exchequer. Indian and Imperial interests in Persia were in their inception common, centring, as they did, in the defence of India, first against France, then against Afghanistan, and more lately against Russia. So long as the interests remained common it was natural that the expenditure should be shared in moieties, and this was the incidence re commended by the Wei by Commission. But in the laborious process of consolidat ing those common interests there have grown up other interests, important and7 ^ substantial in themselves, which constitute a problem apart from the defence of India and which have to be safeguarded and promoted for their own sake If such things can be measured quantitatively, Indian interests are not now comparable ^~'th Imperial interests in Persia. 7. Of the Persian trade, it is true, India appears on the basis of statistics to take the major portion. But the Indian trade is made up largely of transit trade m goods of British origin carried in British bottoms. Moreover, the total bulk is small and quite incommensurate with the enormous sums which of late years India has poured into Persia. Indeed it would be hard to find a country trading with India, in which India, if she had money to spend on trade development abroad, could not spend it to greater profit. More pronounced still is the disparity between British and Indian interests in the field of commercial and industrial enter prise. In the Imperial Bank of Persia, in the great oil interests of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, in the concessions sought or obtained in Persia, India has little or no share. These are interests of great importance it is true, but interests almost exclusively British in character. And if our telegraph interests in Persia are admittedly of great importance and will so remain pending the institution of a wireless service between England and India, these are interests in which His Majesty s Government share without sharing in the expenditure on the Indo- European Telegraph Department. We are, however, considering a suggestion for relieving ourselves altogether of responsibility on account of the Department’s telegraph system and are addressing you separately on this subject. 8 . But nowhere does the old estimate of India’s interests call more insistently for revision than in the strategical and political spheres. The day is past when India can afford to spend money on India’s defences far beyond India’s borders, unless such defences are immediately essential. Such is the financial stringency in India that all the money that can be devoted to defence is required for defence against the most immediate dangers. Persia herself is never likely to be a serious menace, nor is any immediate military danger to India to be apprehended from Russia or Turkey through Persia. Even,, should the old military danger to India reappear the physical limitations imposed by the barrenness of the Persian terrain preclude operations on a large scale, at any rate until it has been bridged by a rail way. Our own difficulties in maintaining a force at Meshed show how unlikely it is that an enemy would attempt an advance in force through Eastern Persia, and an advance along the coast is at present equally improbable owing to our naval and military supremacy in the Persian Gulf. 9. Politically, India’s essential requirements are— First, that no outside power with designs on India should consolidate herself in Persia; Second, that the Persian districts bordering on India and Afghanistan should not lapse into anarchy. The preservation of Persia’s integrity and the maintenance of an Anglophil government in Tehran are both no doubt in India’s interest. But India is not pre pared, is indeed unable, to devote her finances to securing either. Indeed that neither could be so secured and that both might be secured otherwise is the keynote of the many representations on Persian policy which we felt ourselves ^ recen ^ years to address to His Majesty’s Government.In short, all that India desires is to see sufficient stability in the Central Govern ment to ensure a modicum of law and order in Eastern Persia, provided that such stability is not secured at the cost of the consolidation of a potential invader of India on her borders. The potential invader indeed is still Russia, but Russia in a ner| guise. The danger India apprehends from present day Russia is not the military aggression of Czarism, but the insidious penetration of Bolshevism. T1 e natural pathway of Bolshevism lies throrngh disorder and anarchy, and India’s best safeguard in Persia against Russia in its present stage of development would be a friendly Persia with sufficient stability in her finances to maintain her integrity and keep up some sort of administration* on her eastern borders, A policy which aims at anything beyond this, so far from being necessarily in accord with India’s interests, may even prove actually opposed to them. This was brought out clearly in the controversies evoked by the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919. We were opposed to that Agreement because we felt that it went far beyond India’s requirements; that it might involve her in serious financial, polit cal and, very possibly, military commitments; that it would arouse such nationalist hostility to us in Persia as might make our position m Persia itself untenable, and would give Bolshevism a dangerous stimulus, adding to the unrest in Central Asia and to the agitation in political, and especially Moslem, India. It was these considerations that led us even prior to the inception of the Anglo-Persian Agreement to advocate the encouragement of American personnel in the Persian administration. For we felt that the intervention of the United States in Persia would tend powerfully towards the stabilising of the Central Government, the maintenance of the integrity of Persia, and the introduction of some semblance of law and order in the outlying provinces. We felt that access to India would thus be denied to Russia whether in the form of Bolshevism, which would be deprived of its pathway through lawlessness and anarchy, or in the form of a militant Russia, if the future has such in store. Perhaps nothing could more pointedly illustrate the cleavage that has been gradually widening between Indian and Imperial interests in Persia than the fact that His Majesty s Government found themselves constrained to reject this policy we advocated in the interests of India and to pursue in wider Imperial interests a policy that was calculated to place on India a serious financial burden. 10 . .But there is another factor. The emergence of Iraq as a State under British mandate has increased Imperial as distinct fro a Indian interests in Persi If India must admit to special and preponderating interests in Eastern Persia, Iraq has special interests and apparently, for the moment at any rate, even greater interests in Western Persia. The Kurdish problem on the Perso-Mesopotamian frontier is to India a matter of as much indifference as the barhad problem is to I rac b Soviet Consuls and influence in Kermanshah and Ahwaz would prove as nun a matter of concern to Iraq as their counterparts in Nasratabad and Bampur to n ’ if unrest in Sistan and Persian Mekran and Meshed must react on India, unres^ ^ Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Luristan and Arabistan must react no less indeed, it m g be argued, will react a great deal more—on Iraq. Even in the Persian Gul, r supremacy, so long regarded as all important for India, has become at least as p ^ tant for the security of Iraq. Hence, if a ratio is still to be employed for the ^ of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia, we hold that it is no justifiable to insist on India’s continuing to bear half and that India s share, be based more nearly on the real proportion which India s interests bear toy Imperial interests in Persia, including tKose ol Iraq. And tliis new ratio should, we suggest, be nearer a third than a half. 11 . In alluding, however, to a new ratio of division, we do not intend to imply that the present practice of dividing Diplomatic and Consular ^expenditure in Persia in definite proportions is satisfactory, or should be retained. Our intention is to urge that the basis of any new arrangements should be on the postulate that the total expenditure debitable to Indian revenues should be definitely less than that resulting from the present system. As regards the actual procedure to be adopted, we have been forced to the conclusion that the present arrangement is bound to operate in equitably when, as has been in the past and may hereafter often be, there is a conflict of interests. We, therefore, consider that it would be more convenient from the point of view both of His Majesty’s Government and of India if an efiort were made to reduce the number of items of divisible expenditure as far as possible; The interests of India are mostly in Eastern Persia, and we would suggest that we should take over the whole responsibility for ordinary diplomatic and consular expenditure in the Eastern Consulates, namely, Meshed, Sistan, Kerman and Bandar Abbas, which seems to be the utmost that can with any propriety be called a preponderatingly Indian sphere. In addition, we would not object to taking over a portion of the ordinary diplomatic and consular expenditure on the Legation at Tehran and on the Consulate at Bushire. As to these, we would suggest that a fair arrangement would be to charge Indiali revenue with a third of the cost of each. We recognize that we have interests in the Persian Gulf, but we cannot admit that these are equal to Imperial interests including those on account of Iraq. As regards the Tehran Legation, we are prepared to accept a portion of the expendi ture, if our main proposal is approved, on the ground that the Legation, being at the capital, represents Indian as well as Imperial interests. 12 . It has not been possible to make a proper comparison of the actual financial , effects of the proposal set forth above in the absence of reliable figures of expendi ture incurred by the Foreign Office on Persian Consulates in recent years. In the last pre-war year for which we have figures, namely, 1913-14, the Indian portion of the expenditure would have been on this basis Us. 5,70,000 out of a total of Its 13,38,000. In the succeeding years up to 1917-18, the expenditure debitable to India would similarly be Es. 6,87,000, Es. 10,29,000, Es. 9,08,000, and Es. 8,38,000, out of Es. 15,21,000, Es. 23,88,000, Es. 25,10,000, and Es. 23,14,000 respectively. This is less than the present half-and-half division would result in, but in each case comes to somewhat more than the basis of one-third which we have suggested above. We need hardly add that it is impossible to ensure by this method that the total expenditure debited to India should bear a constant ratio to the total expenditure incurred, and it is difficult in any case to say how and m what direc tions the post-war expenditure on the different Consulates will vary from the pre war expenditure. We venture however to recommend to Yotir Lordship s con sideration the method which we have suggested, based as it is on a fu recognition of India’s interests in Persia, and trust that you will be able to negotiate with His Majesty’s Treasury arrangements on these lines. 13. No reference has been made in this despatch to the following subjects (а) Lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf. ( б ) Military garrisons in the Persian Gulf* (c) Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf.' 10 (d) Tehran-Meshed Telegraph line. (e) Sarhad expenditure. (f) Wireless station at Meshed. These are under separate examination, and we propose to address you separately with regard to them, should it appear that a further representation of India’s interests is necessary.

FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. SECR ET. External. The Right Honourable Viscount PEEL, His Majesty's Secretary of State far India. Simla, the 13th July 1922. Incidence of expenditure in Persia. ^MtLoed, In his telegram No. 3860, dated the 7th December 1920, your predecessor asked us to submit any suggestions we might have to offer for the revision of expen diture in Persia as between the Indian and Imperial Exchequers, and in a subsequent v telegram No. 4284, dated the 24th December 1920, he emphasized the necessity of our placing him in possession of a definite and reasoned statement of our views as to the extent of the interests of India in Persia. We much regret the delay that has occurred in forwarding our views on this subject. In the course of our considera tion of the question we were led into an examination of the expenditure which had been debited against Indian revenues on account of Persia from the year 1915-16 onwards. Including sums which may be held to be recoverable from the Persian Government, this expenditure has amounted in all to over 6 million pounds. We have had great difficulty in tracing many of the items ; references to the details of expenditure were scattered over a large number of different communications, and we were, indeed, not in possession of complete figures of expenditure until we received, as the result of inquiries made by us, the figures forwarded to us demi-officially in letters, dated the 30th September 1919 and 29th of July 1920, addressed to our Secretary in the Finance Department. These figures were further brought up to date in a further demi-official letter to the same address, dated the 6 th October 1921. We have now completed our examination of the figures, and are in a position to furnish you with the views for which your predecessor asked. 2 . The system on which Persian expenditure has been debited as between the Indian and Imperial Governments during the last 20 years is based on the recom mendation contained in paragraph 242 of the Welby Commission’s report. We ^uote, for facility of reference, the relevant passage :— The two Governments are not agreed as to the extent of their respective interests in Persia* It is, in our opinion, desirable to adopt a general principle of division which will put an end to these discussions. Roth countries have admittedly a large interest in Persia, and we I ii \ iithink that the charges of the Mission and Consulates should be evenly divided between the two countries. We think, also, that the British Foreign Office should not create or add to the establishments and services under its control without the consent of the Government of India, and vice versa&gt; that the Government of India should not add to the establishments and services under their control without the consent of the Foreign Office. Lastly, the charge as made up for division should be complete, including outfits, pensions, and all contingencies, to which the Government of India sometimes demurs.” Subsequent to the issue of the report, a working arrangement was arrived at under which references were not made to either government when the sum involved was less than £ 100 . But even before the war the principle of division was extended beyond “Diplomatic and Consular” expenditure, pure and simple, and was applied to outlay of various kinds intended for the furtherance of the stability of Persia, as for example, the Anglo-Indian loan of 1903-04. It would appear from papers forwarded to us that the question whether expenditure other than that coming definitely under the head of u Diplomatic and Consular” was strictly governed by the Welby Commission’s report, was considered by Mr. Chamberlain in June 1916 in connection with a proposed Anglo-Pussian loan to Persia; we note that the view then taken by him was that it was of primary importance to India that Persia should be sufficiently well-governed to prevent her from becom ing a danger to India through Afghanistan, and that a half share of the expenditure neeessary to maintain a stable government in Persia could therefore justifiably be debited to India. In regard to the employment of Indian troops in Persia during the war, the Treasury agreed to depart from the “ half-and-half principle, the whole of the extraordinary outlay being charged to the Imperial Government. This, however, was not a special concession in regard to Persia, but was in accordance vith the procedure adopted in other theatres, where India, under the sanction of the Parliamentary Resolutions, bore only the normal cost of maintaining her troops, anything beyond this being defrayed by the Imperial Government. Expenditure coming under the head 4 Loans and Subsidies ’ was in practice shared in moieties. A difference of opinion having arisen in 1917 regarding expenditure classed as ‘ Secret Service,’ a formal discussion took place between the India Office and the Foreign Office, and it was agreed that such expenditure as concerned ‘ Secret Service for military purposes ’ should be debited solely to His Majesty s Government who also undertook, on the same principle, to bear the whole cost of the Sistan and Sarhadi levies, these being held to be military in their nature. As to general politica expenditure. His Majesty’s Government further agreed to the half-and-half ru e. We state these facts as embodying the only information at our disposal regar ing the principles on which India was debited with Persian expenditure during the war. We were not ourselves consulted regarding the principle o division adopted, and, as already explained, we did not receive until a comparative ly late date information regarding numerous items of expenditure debited to our accounts. ^ ? It tA !* 3 . We are constrained to say that it would in bur opinion have been more strict y in accordance with the spirit of the recommendations of the Welby Commission had we been given an opportunity of discussing both the principle and detail o the expenditure debited to Indian revenues from 1916 onwards in accordance vitthese decisions, Fo* facility of reference we reproduce in an Appendix a list of these items as revised up to date, and proceed to comment on some of them in the light of the remarks just made. We shall for the present purpose draw no distinc tion between items which have been held to be recoverable from Persia, and those which are not so classified. Even if recovery is ultimately made, the payment will in the meantime have imposed a severe strain on our resources and materially affected our revenue position:— Item No. 1 (a).—We were debited in 1915-16 with a sum of £7,500 as a moiety of the compensation given to the Farman Farma for destruction of his property by the Nationalist Party. We were not consulted on this . proposal. Item No. 1 (b). —We were not consulted with regard to the payment of sub sidies to the Farman Farma, which commenced in 1916. True, in 1919 we supported a proposal for one particular payment to him, but this was for a specific purpose, viz\, the maintenance of the guards on the northern road, and we urged the need for an early curtailment of our liabilities on this account. The actual payments made to him were for many purposes other than the maintenance of the road guards and we were debited with a total of £48,483 as a subsidy to the Farman Farma in 1916-17 ; £39,142 in 1917-18; £23,677 in 1918-19; £15,707 in 1919-20, and £l ,837 in 1920-21. Items No. 2 (a) and 2 (6).—We were consulted regarding the comparatively small payments to the Sardars Jung and Bahadur but were not consulted regarding the large sums paid to Bakhtiari Khans in 1915-16—of which the moiety debited to us amounted to £17,000. These payments were made mainly in the interests of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company towards which as has since been recognized by the India Office—vide Secretary, Political Department’s letter No. P-5661, dated the 12th January 1922, to our Secretary in the Foreign and Political Department—we have no kind of obligation. Item No. 2 (d). —The subsidy to Sardar Zafarwas sanctioned without refer ence to us ;'the amounts debited to India were £1,082 in 1918-19 and £93 in 1919-20. Item No. 3 (a). —-No reference was made to us regarding the cost of the re moval from Meshed to Shahrud of the Cossack Division, for which we were debited with £1,525 in 1918-19. Item No. 3 (&amp;).—In regard to the general expenses of the Cossack Division, we would note that we deprecated the financing of the Cossack Division, but stated that, if the proposals for further finance were adopted, the incidence would depend on the decision regarding the so- called political expenditure in Persia. We had previously expressed the opinion that this expenditure should not be shared by India, as being outside the scope of the Government of India Act and the Parliamentary Resolutions regarding India’s financial liabilities during the war. The decision adopted, however, was to finance the force, and India was debited with £258,592 in 1918-19, £176,840 in 1919-20, and £271,525 in 1920-21. We still feel the greatest difficulty in comprehending how this expenditure on a force intended to co operate with the Norperforce based on Mesopotamia could be brought within the terms of the Resolutions of Parliament or the Government of India Act.Item No. 6. —We make no comment with regard to this on the understand’ jng that the charge against us has been withdrawn. Items No. 7 and 8 [a) and (c). —In regard to the subsidy to Kawam-ul-Mulk and Soulet for restoration of order in Fars we were consulted and agreed to bear a moiety of the expenditure. The same is the case with regard to the expenditure incurred on the Kashgai rising and the liabilities incurred by the Consul at Shiraz in this connection. Item No. 9. —We have no details regarding the sum of £3,947 with which we were debited in 1917-18 under the head of “ Subsidy to Persiap Government.'’ Items No. 12 (a), (5) and(c). —We* were consulted on, and agreed to, the expenditure on relief measures at Shiraz, for which we were debited with £6,230 in 1917-18 and £2,631 in 1918-19, but were not apparent ly consulted in regard to the expenditure on relief measures at Tehran for which we were debited with £5,154 in 1918. The same is the case with regard to the expenditure on relief measures at Hamadan in connection with which we were debited with £18,951 in 1918-19 and £1,743 in 1920-21. Item No. 13. —We deprecated the proposal to finance Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who subsequently headed the Kashgai rising. We were, however, debited with a sum of £8,406 as our moiety of the subsidy given in 1917- 18. Item No. 14. —A reference was made to us on the proposal to make certain payments to the Shah, on condition that he supported the Cabinet of Vossuk-ed-Dowleh, We protested against the policy generally, but agreed that, |f the proposals formulated were adopted, the incidence of their cost should follow that of the so-called political expenditure in Persia. We were, however, debited with a sum of £12,885 in 1918-19, £33,101 in 1919-20 and £14,275 in 1920-21. Item No. 15. —If we are correct, no reference was made to us before a payment was made to the late Zill-es-Sultan in order to allow him to take up the appointment of Governor General of Ispahan. We were, however, debited with an expenditure of £3,558 on this account in 1917-18. Item No. 16 (a). —We were consulted regarding the expenditure of Secret Service money by the Minister at Tehran and intimated that we were not in a position to pass an opinion on the possible effect of the financial proposals made by the Minister. We were, however, debited with a sum of £28,000 in 1915-16, £22,500 in 191*6-17, £12,500 in 1917-18, £32,500 in 1918-19, £5,000 in 1919-20, and £10,000 in 1920-21. Item No. 16 (b). —We cannot trace any papers regarding payments made to Vossuk-ed-Dowleh in 1918-19, but were debited with £5,100 in 1918- 19 and £4,250 in 1919-20 on this account. Item No. 17. —We were fully consulted regarding the proposals which led up to the payments described under the head Moratorium, and though we thought the terms at first proposed by Persia to be prohibitiveand preposterous, we agreed in June 1916 tliat we were prepared to pay the usual share if His Majesty’s Government were satisfied as to the necessity of this subsidy for the maintenance of a friendly and effective Persian government, but we expressed our dissatisfaction both with the policy and with the Persian Government that it pro duced. The sums debited to us as our share of the moratorium were £112,500 in 1915-16, £90,000 in 1916-17, £15,983 in 1917-18, £264,380 in 1918-19, £778,915 in 1919-20, and £795,900 in 1920-21. Item No. 19—The proposal for a joint loan of two million sterling to the Persian Government was referred to us for our opinion, and it is only necessary to note here that the Government of India consistently opposed the contemplated Anglo-Persian agreement, both on princi ple and on grounds of expediency. With reference to the financial aspect of the agreement we stated that ‘ we need say nothing beyond repeating that it will be our duty to resist strenuously the extension of the financial commitments of India.’ It was, however, decided that India should share in the loan to Persia, and, although the agree ment was not ratified and the loan therefore fell to the ground, we were debited in 1919-20 with a sum of £65,573. This, we under stand, was a payment made to Vossuk-ed-Dowleh in order to secure his good services in regard to the agreement. Item No. 20.—In view of the full correspondence which took place with your predecessor on the subject of the financing of the South Persia Rifles, it is unnecessary for us to refer at any length here to this expenditure. The. last statement of our case was conveyed in our despatch No. 55, dated the 13th February 1920. We may be pardoned for saying here that in our opinion the objections of India to the payments on account of the South Persia Rifles were not stated as fully as we could have desired, when the question of the legality of these payments was referred for legal opinion. In any case, however, that opinion merely amounted to a statement that the question whether this expenditure was in its essence military expenditure was really a question of fact, &lt; upon which the legal adviser himself was hardly competent to express an opinion. We must reiterate our regret that, in spite of our protests, it was decided to treat this expenditure as other than military, with the result that India has been debited with over three and-a-half million pounds. 4 . We have made these references to individual items of expenditure incurred in Persia for two reasons. In the first place, we consider it our duty, even at this late date, to protest against certain of these payments being admitted as a final debit against Indian revenues. We were at one time hopeful of finding some common formula which we could commend to you as suitable for adoption in reviewing the whole of the Persian expenditure debited against us during the war years, with a view to its redistribution on a more suitable basis. In this, however, we have not succeeded. The multifarious nature of the items, and the fact that we have ourselves admitted in more than *one case that our interests justified our taking a share in the expenditure, seem to render it impossible to arrive at any general principle of revision, and we consider that the items must be considered on their own merits. We have, of course, no desire to reopen the question regarding expenditureto which we had already agreed, nor do we wish to discuss here any item of minor import. There are, however, some items in regard to which we feel strongly that we ought to be relieved of all liability. These are the payments on account of the*- Cossack Division (No. 3) ; the payment to Soulet-ed-Dowleh (No. 13) ; the subsidy to the Shah (No. 14) ; the payment to Yossuk-ed Dowleh (No. 16 ( 6 )J ; the special expenditure m connection with the loan of 1920 (hiO. 19) , and the payment on account of the South Persia Rifles (No. 20 ). It will be observed that some of these payments extended beyond 1918-19 and they could not therefore even be described as made in furtherance of the objects connected with the war. The heavy pay ments made on account of Persia have more than once formed the subject of adverse criticism in India, and we should find the greatest difficulty even in pretending to justify the particular expenditure to which we have referred, were it made the subject of detailed interpellation by the Legislature. 5 . In the second place, we think that the figures we have quoted illustrate the grave danger to our finances involved in an understanding that expenditure of any particular type shall be divided on any rule of proportions. It is clear that, when an emergency arises, such understanding affords an argument for extending the principle of division into a sphere not contemplated by the original agreement. It is as a consequence of the existence of an agreement of this nature that we have in the past years been debited with large sums, sometimes in furtherance of a policy to which we were definitely opposed, and on other occasions without even being allowed an opportunity of expressing an opinion on the expenditure. We shall return subsequently to the system which we now propose should be followed in regulating the division of expenditure as between the Indian and the Imperial Ex chequers. But we desire to make one preliminary remark. It is useless to devise any new formula of distribution, unless we can obtain some guarantee that the latter will be strictly interpreted, and that, wherever it is found necessary to go beyond a strict interpretation, the previous consent of the Government of India is obtain ed. Political expenditure is not subject to the vote of the Legislature, but it is, in practice, open to interpellation and discussion, and you will, we trust, concede that it is unreasonable to ask us to justify to the Assembly expenditure about the propriety of which we have not been convinced or even consulted. We do not overlook the statutory powers of the Secretary of State in Council in regard to expenditure from the revenues of India, but we are convinced that it will not be possible to place expenditure of this nature (which is not strictly concerned with the governance of India itself) on a satisfactory basis, until it is definitely agreed that no fresh expenditure on Persia, and in particular no expenditure that goes beyond the strictest definition of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure—the upkeep of the legation and consulates and the usual contingent expenditure thereon—shall be debited against India without the previous and express assent of the Government of India. 6 . We turn now to consider the present extent of India’s interests in Persia in order to arrive at a decision as to the principle on which expenditure should m future be divided between India and the Imperial Exchequer. Indian and Imperial interests in Persia were in their inception common, centring, as they did, in the defence of India, first against ^France, then against' Afghanistan, and more lately against Russhk So long as the interests remained common it was natural that the expenditure should be shared in moieties, and this was the incidence re commended by the Welby Commission. But in the laborious process of consolidat ing those common interests there have grown up other interests, important and( 53 \ i /j / / substantial in themselves, which constitute a problem apart from the defence of India and which have to be safeguarded and promoted for their own sake. If such ^things *can be measured quantitatively, Indian interests are not now comparable ss inth Imperial interests in Persia. ■ 7. Of the Persian trade, it is true, India appears on the basis of statistics to take the major portion. But the Indian trade is made up largely of transit trade in goods of British origin carried in British bottoms. Moreover, the total bulk is small and quite incommensurate with the enormous sums which of late years has poured into Persia!. Indeed it would be hard to find a country trading with India, in which India, if she had money to spend on trade development abroad, could not spend it to greater profit. More pronounced still is the disparity between British and Indian interests in the field of commercial and industrial enter prise. In the Imperial Bank of Persia, in the great oil interests of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, in the concessions sought or obtained in Persia, India has little or no share. These are interests of great importance it is true, but interests almost exclusively British in character. And if our telegraph interests in Persia are admittedly of great importance and will so remain pending the institution of a wireless service between England and Indim these are interests in which His Majesty’s Government share without sharing in the expenditure on the Indo- ' h ‘ European Telegraph Department. We are, however, considering a suggestion for relieving ourselves altogether of responsibility on account of the Department’s telegraph system and are addressing you separately on this subject. 8 . But nowhere does the old estimate of India’s interests call more insistently for revision than in the strategical and political spheres. The day is past when India can afford to spend money on India’s defences far beyond India’s borders, unless such defences are immediately essential. Such is the financial stringency in India that all the money that can be devoted to defence is required for defence against the most immediate dangers. Persia herself is never likely to be a serious menace, nor is any immediate military danger to India to be apprehended from Russia or Turkey through Persia. Even should the old military danger to India reappear the physical limitation^ imposed by the barrenness of the Persian terrain preclude operations on a large scale, at any rate until it has been bridged by a rail way. Our own difficulties in maintaining a force at Meshed show how unlikely it is that an enemy would attempt an advance in force through Eastern Persia, and an advance along the coast is at present equally improbable owing to our naval and military supremacy in the Persian Gulf.l . - . . . ' it 9. Politically, India’s essential requirements are— ^ • . . . f-Y First, that no outside power with designs on India should consolidate herself in Persia; h ur Lpe. f . . i t'**' 7\ ^ Second, that the Persian districts bordering on India and Afghanistan t should not lapse into anarchy. P ^ , ,:, 4 ' .-V ^ ' ' ' ' ' V U &gt; The preservation of Persia’s integrity and the maintenance of an Anglophil government in Tehran are both no doubt in India’s interest. But India is not pre pared, is indeed unable, to devote her finances to securing either. Indeed that neither could be so secured and that both might be secured otherwise is the keynote of the many representations on Persian policy which we felt ourselves constrained in recent years to address to His Majesty’s Government. C73ITD , tU v , .^ I J: i i In short, all that India desires is to see sufficient stability in the Central Govern ment to ensure a modicum of law and order in Eastern Persia, provided that such stability is not secured at the cost of the consolidation of a potential invader of India ^ on her borders. The potential invader indeed is still Russia, but Russia in a new' 1 ' guise. The danger India apprehends from present day Russia is not the military aggression of Czarism, but the insidious penetration of Bolshevism. Tie natural pathway of Bolshevism lies through disorder and anarchy, and India’s best safeguard in Persia against Russia in its present stage of development would be a friendly Persia with sufficient stability in her finances to maintain her integrity and keep up some sort of administration on her eastern borders. A policy which aims at anything beyond this, so far from being necessarily in accord with India’s interests, may even prove actually opposed to them. This was brought out clearly in the controversies evoked by the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919. We were opposed to that Agreement because we felt that it went far beyond India’s requirements; that it miglt involve her in serious financial, poht cal and, very possibly, military commitments; that it would arouse such nationalist hostility to us in Persia as might make our position in Persia itself untenable; and would give Bolshevism a dangerous stimulus, adding to the unrest in Central Asia and to the agitation in political, and especially Moslem, India. It was these considerations that led us even prior to the inception of the Anglo-Persian Agreement to advocate the encouragement of American personnel in the Persian administration. For we felt that the intervention of the United States m Persia would tend powerfully towards the stabilising of the Central Government, the maintenance of the integrity of Persia, and the introduction of some semblance of law and order in the outlying provinces. We felt that access to India would thus be denied to Russia whether in the form of Bolshevism, which would be deprived of its pathway through lawlessness and anarchy, or in the form of a mi tan Russia, if the future has such in store. Perhaps nothing could more pointed y illustrate the cleavage that has been gradually widening between Indian an Imperial interests in Persia than the fact that His Majesty s Government oun themselves constrained to reject this policy we advocated in the interests o India and to pursue in wider Imperial interests a policy that was calcu ated o place on India a serious financial burden. 10 . But there is another factor. The emergence of Iraq as a State under British mandate has increased Imperial as distinct from Indian interests m If India must admit to special and preponderating interests in Eastern Persia, raq has special interests and apparently, for the moment at any rate, even grea interests in Western Persia. The Kurdish problem on the Perso Mesopotam frontier is to India a matter of as much indifference as the Sarhad problem is to r q, Soviet Consuls and influence in Kermanshah and Ahwaz would prove as niucti a matter of concern to Iraq as their counterparts in Nasratabad and Bampur to n ’ if/unrest in Sistan and Persian Mekran and Meshed must react on India, unrest in Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Luristan and Arabistan must react no less— indeed, it nug i be argued, will react a great deal more—on Iraq. Even in the Persian Gu , r supremacy, so long regarded as all important for India, has become at least as unp A., tant for the security of Iraq. Hence, if a ratio is still to be employed foi the ivi tt fit/-' ‘ r 1 of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia, we hold that it is no longer u i'V *4 tUr c 4 jt u rw,/ W ^ ‘ e ul ft. / l m i- 1 Z C/ justifiable to insist on India’s continuing to bear half and that India s share sho be based more nearly on the real proportion which India a interests beai to f h 1 -tc. ■A !Lr tt c. ■tUkImperial interests in Persia, including those of Iraq. And this new ratio should, we suggest, be nearer a third than a half. 11. In alluding, however, to a new ratio of division, we do not intend to imply that the present practice of dividing Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia in definite proportions is satisfactory, or should be retained. Our intention is to urge that the basis of any new arrangements should be on the postulate that the total expenditure debitable to Indian revenues should be definitely less than that resulting from the present system. As regards the actual procedure to be adopted, we have been forced to the conclusion that the present arrangement is bound to operate in equitably when, as has been in the past and may hereafter often be, there is a conflict of interests. We, therefore, consider that it would be more convenient from the point of view both of His Majesty’s Government and of India if an effort were made to reduce the number of items of divisible expenditure as far as possible. The interests of India are mostly in Eastern Persia, and we would suggest that we should take over the whole responsibility for ordinary diplomatic and consular expenditure in the Eastern Consulates, namely, Meshed, Sistan, Kerman and Bandar Abbas, which seems to be the utmost that can with any propriety be called a preponderatingly Indian sphere. In addition, we would not object to taking over a portion of the ordinary diplomatic and consular expenditure on the Legation at Tehran and on the Consulate at Bushire. As to these, we would suggest that a fair arrangement would be to charge Indian revenue with a third of the cost of each. We recognize that we have interests in the Persian Gulf, but we cannot admit that these are equal to Imperial interests including those on account of Iraq. As regards the Tehran Legation, we are prepared to accept a portion of the expendi ture, if our main proposal is approved, on the ground that the Legation, being at the capital, represents Indian as well as Imperial interests. 12. It has not been possible to make a proper comparison of the actual financial effects of the proposal set forth above in the absence of reliable figures of expendi ture incurred by the Foreign Office on Persian Consulates in recent years. In the last pre-war year for which we have figures, namely, 1913-14, the Indian poition of the expenditure would have been on this basis Rs. 5,70,000 out of a total of Rs 13 38 000 In the succeeding years up to 1917-18, the expenditure debitable to India would similarly be Rs. 6,87,000, Rs. 10,29,000, Rs. 9,08,000, and Rs. 8,38,000, out of Rs 15 , 21 , 000 , Rs. 23,88,000, Rs. 25,10,000, and Rs. 23,14,000 respectively. This is less than the present half-and-half division would result m, but m each case comes to somewhat more than the basis of one-third which we have suggested above We need hardly add that it is impossible to ensure by this method that the total expenditure debited to India should bear a constant ratio to the total expenditure incurred, and it is difficult in any case to say how and m what direc tions the post-war expenditure on the different Consulates will vary from the pre war expenditure. We venture however to recommend to Your Lords ip s con sideration the method which we have suggested, based as it is on a fu recognition of India’s interests in Persia, and trust that you will be able to negotiate with His Majesty’s Treasury arrangements on these lines. _ 13.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acquaint you for the information of Earl Curzon of Kedieston that he has laid before the Council of India the question of the contribution from India Revenues of a moiety of the projected loan of £2,000,000 to the Persian Government. The Secretary of State in Council, after consultation with the Government of India by telegraphic correspondence (copy of which is enclosed as marginally shewn) is willing retjliry 'of State to Viceroy,) to accept this liability on Indian Revenues dated 30th May ) ceroy to Secretary of State ) on the understanding that The Lords dated 13th June. ) Commissioners of the Treasury agree to the re-examination at the earliest convenient date, of the whole question of the incidence on Indian and Imperial Revenues of expenditure in Persia, and further, that if this examination leads to a re-adjustment in principle of the scale of division of such expenditure, the new scale shall be applied with retrospective effect to the loan now in contemplation, including of course any advance payments to the Persian Government which are to be charged to that Government against the loan.

The India Office may contend that the best place to defend India is on the Indian frontier and that, as far as India is concerned, we can leave Persia to her fate. This may be true as regards an armed attack, but the disruption of Persia would probably be followed by a similar process in Afghanistan. It would, moreover, not be a case of defending India against an armed invasion, but against an intense hostile propaganda - more difficult to counter and no longer carried on by crude Bolshevik agents, but by emissaries from the Shiah eo-religionists of the Mohajosoedan malcontents in India who will have been poisoned ’oy Bolshevik doctrines.

As regards the first problem, the agreement said to have been concluded, or on the point oi being concluded, between Soviets and Persia doubtless offers no safeguard against prosecution of Bolsheviks’ prooramme of aggiessne expansion, nevertheless, it is difficult to believe that they will proceed to extremities immediately after having concluded such an agreement with Persia ana having been deprived, by the withdrawal of the troops, of their last excuse for armed intrusion into Persia. It will be remembered that thev’were expected to occupy la briz directly it was left open, but they ha In this connection it . v ave ; not yet done so. in tins connection it is worth noting that, when the first news of our intended evacuation was telegraphed by Teheran merchants to their correspondents here, general panic ensued, for it was regarded as portending loss of not less than 4,000,000 sterling to Baghdad merchants, in the shape of outstandings or stocks of merchandise left in Persia without hope of recovery. This panic, however, in a general measure subsided when it became known that Persia was on the point of concluding a treaty with the Soviets, as it was believed that such a treaty, combined with our retirement, would put an end to Bolshevik activities in Persia and reopen trade route between Baghdad and Enzeli. This is doubtless a sanguine outlook, but for many reasons it is greatly to be desired that the withdrawal of Europeans from Teheran could have been postponed, or at all events left to take its natural course without pressure. It is easy to imagine the lamentable picture of apparent British impotence and collapse before the Bolshevik menace, which will be presented to the public of this region by the stream of women and children trickling down Teheran-Baghdad road, under circumstances of grave discomfort and hardship, resulting from severe winter conditions, and with our troops following on their heels. It would have been infinitely less harmful if the civilian evacuation could have been deferred, at any rate until the immediate effect of our military withdrawal, both on Bolsheviks and Teheran public, had become apparent; and then (if it were inevitable) if it could have taken the form of a gradual exodus to or via Ispahan in the spring. [ note the reasons given by His Majesty’s Minister for putting that route out of the question, but I shall venture to revert to the subject later on. As to the question of financial assistance, 1 understand that His Majesty s Government have suspended all subsidies to Central Government, and intend to cease financing South Persian Rifles from 1st April. It is clear from the papers that this policy has been forced upon the Cabinet by the insistence of the public at home on drastic reduction of expenditure. But unless some alternative constinictive policy can be devised to counteract its destructive effect, adoption of such a line of action; will entail complete collapse of commercial position in Persia, which it has taken generations to establish. It will react, both commercially and politically,, in Afghanistan and Mesopotamia, and in the latter case will greatly upset the calculations on which we have formed our Budget. It seems to amount to this : IN lis Majesty s Government are prepared to continue to incur certain expenditure in Persia to cave remnants of our position, something can no doubt be done and is worth doing. It they are not so prepared, but insist on withholding all further linancial assistance, I see no alternative but to evacuate our women and children, not only from leiieian hut from all towns in Persia, and simply leave those who will not come away oi v lose presence until the last moment is a necessity, to await the development ot chaos. Reverting to Bolshevik menace, I am aware that there is a section or i ow-nan public in Teheran and Gillan who see in Bolshevism, as they see in otaei xoims of anarchy, golden opportunities for enriching themselves. I am convinced, hov e \ei, that the people of Persia in general are not prone to welcome Bolshevism, an' vw hold out against it if given am' solid foundation to stand, on. As regards Anglo-Persian Agreement. lair and reasonable document as it m, it has become such a red herring to the Bolshevik and Such a pietext foi extiem is propaganda, that I agree with the Government of India, that limst ( ' ro l ) 'I 111 l b present form as a basis of policy. Ot: the other hand, it is difficult to | : ’ T (Hlc , f '’ ve j iri y scheme of financial assistance calculated to save Persian situation which His-i aje.^ y s Government could be expected to enter upon without protecting themselves )\ some agreement of same kind. . . I now beg to (? submit omitted) for consideration two lines of policy for adoption according to circumstances. The first is, that we should not assume that alt m os, in Teheran. The trend of recent intelligence reports regarding Bolshevik plans rather indicates that thev have other pre-occupations for the p resen t, e s ion erlar^P therefore to delay evacuatjou of women and children at any rate until the early Summer then if it proves (? word omitted) it should take the form of a gradual exodus to Ispahan and Shiraz, but in co-operation with-hakhtians. I am aware that here the main difficulty lies in the question of transport, but it, seems quite possible that mule transport can be collected at Ispahan, and a conyoy of vans be sent up from Bushire via Shiraz, on which route they would have the protection of the- South Persian Pifles. Meanwhile, we should rally our adherents at the capital amongst moderate Nationalists and non-Bolshevik elements, who are convinced that the country can only be saved from anarchy with our help. W e should devise another agreement which the Majlis will accept, and on basis oi which 1 is Majesty s Govern ment will continue to help Persia. It is quite possible that such an agreement may involve our acquiescence in a change of Shah or change ol uynasty, and L do not think that we should hesitate in giving it. In any case, attitude of Bakhtiaris will be an important factor, and 1 do not at all agree with the view expressed by His 1 Majesty’s Minister that they are essentially unfriendly. On the contrary, ! believe they are fully alive to advantages of friendly relations with us, and provided their interests are safeguarded and promoted, the majority of them could be got to participate with us in any scheme for the saving of Persia from chaos. Supposing that it is decided that (? word omitted) has gone too far to admit of the adoption ol the above policy, or if it is tried and fails, then 1 think we must nniKC up our minds to let Northern Persia go Bolshevik if it wishes to; but in that case, provided again that we are prepared to spend some money, I see no reason why we should not hope to maintain our interests and effective influence in the sphere in Avhich they mainly exist, and which I should include by a line passing froin the Persian frontier near Khanikin, through Kennanshah, Khurumabad, Ispahan, Yezd, Kerman, and so on, and 1 think our policy should be to stabilise situation in that In fact, it seems to me impossible that we can do otherwise than endeavour to area. ensure safety of our numerous and vital oil interests in this part of Persia, namely, near Qa'sr-i-’Shirin, in Pushtikuh, in Arabistan, and in Bakhtiari country. Maintenance of close relations wixh Bakhtiaris is essential both parties, and we must remember that Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman are now in the hands of Bakhtiari Governors. In the event of a collapse of the Government at Teheran, and the flight of the Shah, I think we should (? allow' the) Wall of Pushtikuh, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and the Bakhtiaris to ^declare their independence, or their separation from Government of Teheran, and should encourage them to make a three-cornered pact among themselves to stand together to maintain their own interests and resist Bolshevik aggression. We should probably (? do omitted) well to have Kashgais (corrupt group) in too. All four elements are mainly tribal and already practically independent. They would only need a hint to induce turbulent tribes to take action, but for us it would be important that they should act together. Such a confederation wmuld offer a very formidable buhvark to Bolshevik aggression, as w r ell as protection of our own material and legitimate interests in Persia. If this line of policy be* favourably entertained, it seems to me that we shoi® do all that is possible to expedite improvement of communications from south Tutw ards, namely, from Khanikin to Kermanshah, from Mohammerah to Khurumabaa, and roads from Ahwaz, Bushire and Bandar Abbas. I avou Id venture to suggest that, if the above suggestions are considered to provide basis for any constructive line of policy, representatives of all the chief British firms with commercial stakes in Persia should be called together for discussion of the subject, in order that it may lie known what amount of co-operation may be expected from them.or 3 A* PUT AWAY WITH e C0XX . .

Question of revision of Agreement of 1900 with Foreign Office. 1 . Extract from letter from India Office to Foreign Office of 19th March 1910 (Pol. 268). In view of the large and increasing adjustments in favour of this Office which are now necessary in connection with the annual statements of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia, the continuance of an annual payment of 4,087h 10s. from Indian to Imperial Revenues in advance of the adjustment (two years later), based on the actual expenditure of the two Governments, does not appear to be any longer appropriate, and I am to suggest for Sir E. Grey’s consideration that it should be abandoned. I am, &amp;c., R. Ritchie. 2. Extract from letter from Foreign Office to India Office, dated 3rd May 1910. 2. With reference to the concluding paragraph of your letter, I am to observe that it would seem most convenient to regard the payment made in any year as the contribution in respect of that year, although the amount is based on the actual expenditure of the last year but one. If, however, it . is regarded merely as a settlement of accounts of previous years, I am to point out that the sum of 4,087L 10s. is not a contribution by India solely on account of Persia, 487L 10s., being in fact, the amount paid for that service, as will be seen from the letter from this Office to the Treasury of August 11th, 1900, which was communicated to you by the Treasury on September 11th, 1900. 3. Moreover, it is not certain that the present excess of expenditure by India will continue ; Turbat-i-Haidari has been reduced, the exchange of Kermanshah and Mohammerah involves less expenditure than before from Indian revenues, and the total Indian expenditure in 1907—8 was largely swollen by arrear charges. There is, again, the prospect of economies in the establishments administered by India as stated in your letter^ undei ieply, while the proposal in the letter from this Office, No. 1153. of 4 ebruary 20th, 1909, that certain posts which are at present held by Indian officials should in future be filled from the Levant Consular Service, would further relieve India of providing in the first instance for those establishments. 4. As Lord Morley is aware, the accounts from India have not hitherto been received till long after the expiration of the year to which they relate, and if these are in future rendered at an earlier date a moie speedy settle ment will become possible. 5. Under these circumstances it would appear best that any modification of tlie existing methods of adjusting accounts should be deferred till a general revision of the 1900 arrangement, when it will be necessary to take into account also the additional expenditure incurred by this Department m China since that date. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, W. Langley.3. Note by Financial Department, India Office (F. 2137/10). Political Secretary, I attach a draft reply to the Foreign Office. In view of the reference made by the Foreign Office to “a general revision of the 1900 arrangement” an examination has been made in this Department of the financial effect of this arrangement. It will be seen from the attached notes that owing to various causes India is at present pa vino- a slightly larger sum annually than the Foreign Office in respect of Persia (after taking into account all adjustments made under the terms of the settlement) • that she is bearing the larger share of expenditure in Turkish Arabia • and the whole of the expenditure in respect of Muscat. I think therefore that even if we were called upon to pay something extra in respect of China (and this perhaps would be open to question), we have nothing to fear from a revision of the 1900 arrangement. The detailed statement of expenditure by the Foreign Office in Persia and Siam m 1908 9 has been retained in this Department for reference m connection with the Political Secretary’s reference of loth April last -t optical ooo. 13th August 1910. W. Robinson, for Financial Secretary. memoranda accompanying- 3 . Effect of general revision of Agreement of 1900. , Jlle result °f a revision of this Agreement would depend on various factors, the most important being presumably : I.

Turkish Arabia: — In addition India is bearing the larger part of the Diplomatic and Consular Establishments in Turkish Arabia, which was supposed to have been shared as a consequence of the recommendation of the Welby Com mission {see note on Persian expenditure attached). The average annual outlay by India is about 0,000b, in addition to a special contribution of 1,400b to the Foreign Office in respect of Basra, in the annual subsidy. The Foreign Office spend about 1,500b a year on Basra and give us a small contribution towards Baghdad (half of Mr. Gaskin’s salary.) III.

Kashgar : Pay of Special Assistant, Rs. 1,850. (Punjab Estimates, Cashmere : Esta blishment and other charges.) India in respect of Persia, Turkish Arabia, and Muscat, thus amounts to about 17,750Z.t There may also be Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in connection with some other places outside Persia which is borne entirely by India. The Political Department would be in a position to say whether this is the caseA IV. China : — As regards China the arrangement from 1834 to 1875 was that India paid one-third of the charges, from i870—89 India paid a fixed contribution of 15,000b a year. As a result of the Foreign Office Conference in 1891 the contribution was reduced to 12,500b, a rate which was to continue in force till 1899-1900. The Welby Commission considered that the interest of India in the China trade had thus always been officially acknowledged, and that it must be borne in mind that “India depends for a considerable proportion of her revenue on the opium trade with China. One-third o the divisible charges they stated would amount to about 20,000b a y ea B but they recommended that the decision of the Foreign Office Conference should he maintained for a period of five or six years, the contribution t en o e revised. The payment of 12,500b a year in respect of China was however, one of those which the Imperial Government agreed to forego m lieu o± the contribution of 50,000b a year from them towards the expenses oi the India Office, which was recommended by the Welby Commission, r t presen , therefore, India may be regarded as contributing 12,500b towards expenditure 1 Themitlay of the Foreign Office in China in 1910-11 is estimated at 89,5001.® approximately. In 1900-01 it was 72,2001.” If I ndia were to pay m t Shofubris/Atf the excess of Indian expenditure in Turkish Arabia is understated above; the correct figure is 6,816Z., not 6,000Z. (see page 15). 15583. B !’li i 1 1 K HI 1 1 rthe same proportion as in 1900-01 she would pay 15,500L (72,200h: 89,500Z. : : 12,500Z.), or an increase of approximately 3,000Z. a year. This would be on the assumption that India has still the same proportionate interest in China as she had in 1900. The recent arrangements which have been made, however, in negotiation with the Chinese Government for the reduction and final cessation of the exports of opium from India to China within seven years from the present date has materially altered the situation so far as the trade in opium is concerned. In the circumstances there does not appear to be any strong ground, if any ground at all, for increasing the present contri bution to the Imperial Government in respect of China.

It would seem, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from a revision of the 1900 Agreement, but on the contrary would have a reasonable claim to additional contributions from the Foreign Office in respect of Persia and Turkish Arabia, and possibly to a contribution in respect of Muscat. W. R. B.—Present incidence of Expenditure in Persia and Turkish Arabia. I.—Financial Position in 1907-08. Ihe financial position in 1907-08, the latest year in respect of which an adjustment of expenditure has been made between the India Office and the Foreign Office, was as follows : — The payments by India in Persia in 1907-08 amounted to - In addition India paid to Foreign Office in 1907-08 as part of the standing advance in respect of that year The Government of India’s expenditure in Turkish Arabia (according to Budget estimate) was 66,832 (Pol. 268/10). 4 (Included in annual &gt; payment dealt with in 487 ) Pol. 571a/08.

The explanation of this difference is as follows :— IL— Financial effect of Report of Welby Commission. 1. Effect assumed by Commission .—According to the figures before the Welby Commission (Voi. II. of Report, pages 403, 404) the Indian expenditure in connection with Persia and Turkish Arabia was apparently 8,700/. per annum higher than the Foreign Office expenditure. They recommended a reduction of 5,000/. per annum in the subsidy annually paid by the India Office to the Foreign Office. This would have had the effect, if the sum of 8,700/. per annum had correctly represented the excess of Indian over Foreign Office expenditure, of leaving the Indian expenditure less per annum than the Foreign Office expenditure by 1,300/. Or, if a sum of 8337. per annum (page 403) spent by the Foreign Office on the Karum River subsidy be excluded, by 467/. Ct Li. Disturbing factors.—As a matter of fact this result was not attained at September 1900 for the following reasons :— (1) The Foreign Office expenditure shown in the documents before the Commission was really 7,000/. a year less than appeared to be the case, as a deduction of this amount should have been made in respect of the India Office subsidy from the gross outlay of the Foreign Office shown on page 403. _ _ (2) The outlay by the Government of India in Persia and Turkish Arabia at September 1900 (taking the average of the figures for 1899-1900 and 1900-01 in Government of India’s Foreign Letter, 27th March 1902, No. 56, as the nearest possible approximation to this rate) was 30,037/.

(3) The Foreign Office expenditure in Persia at September 1900 was (taking as the nearest possible approximation the average figure for 1899-1900, and 1900-01 given in Annex 3, Enclosure 14, Political Despatch 14, 6th February 1903, and omitting expenditure on Karun Subsidy) 21,9661., instead of 21,82V. m table laid before Commission.

Actual result at September 1900.—The actual result as regards September 1900 was as follows :— Excess of Indian expenditure India paid in Persia and Turkish A rabia - 30,037 (approximately, see above.) The India Office paid the Foreign Office 2,400 The Foreign Office paid in Persia 32,437 - 21,966 (approximately, see Deduct receipt from India Office above.) 2,400 Net payments - - 19,566 12,871 This agrees very closely with the theoretical result worked out above. 4. Disturbing factors between September 1900 and 1907-08.—The causes which led to a reduction of the excess payments by India from 12,871k at September 1900 to 8,761k 0 in 1907-08 are somewhat obscure, and are being investigated in the Financial Department. The disturbing factors appear to have come in during the years from 1900 to 1905-06, but they have not been satisfactorily traced. Expenditure at Basra. We pay the Foreign Office 1,400k a year in respect of Basra, the contribution of 6,000k a year to the Foreign Office in respect of Persia and the minor Consulates agreed upon in 1900 having included 1,400/. in respect of Basra. According to the Foreign Office estimates for 1910-11 their estimated expenditure on Basra in that year is— £ Consul - - - _ _ 850 Office expenses - - - 646 1,496 W. R. 4. Letter from India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Whitehall, S.W., 8th September 1910. n With reference to the concluding paragraph of Sir R. Ritchie’s letter of 19th March last, and paragraphs 2-5 of your reply of 3rd May, No. 10,693, I am directed to state that the payment made each year to this Office by your Department in respect of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia has always been regarded by this Department (as will be seen on reference to the annual claims) as being the net result of t'wo transactions, viz : — (1) An adjustment in respect of the expenditure by the two Governments in the previous year but one ; and (2) A standing advance of 4,087/. 10s. by this Office to the Foreign Office in respect of the current year. It has, of. course, been recognised by this Department that the sum of 4,087/. 10s. just mentioned is made up of various items, of which only487L 105. is in respect of Persia. But in view of the fact that the annual expenditure by India in Persia is now very greatly in excess of the Imperial expenditure —the amount of the excess in 1907-8 (the last year in respect of which an adjustment has been made) having been 35,414L—and that no payment m respect of this additional outlay is made to this Office until between one and two years after date, it seemed to the Secretary of State for India in Council inappropriate that in addition this Department should continue to make a payment in advance ; and although only a part of the advance of 4,087L lOa. is in respect of Persia it seemed not unreasonable, as the various items have hitherto been lumped together, that the whole of the advance should be discontinued. It would, in fact, in Lord Morley’s opinion, have been reasonable to go further and to suggest that a standing advance should be made by the Foreign Office to the India Office, but his Lordship did not wish to press this suggestion. It is argued in your letter under reply that the present excess of expenditure by India may not continue, but while this is not denied, it seems likely that the Government of India’s expenditure in Persia will continue to be in excess of that incurred by the Foreign Office for at least some years to come; and in the meantime it seems to be unreasonable to continue a system of advances which have now for some years ceased to be appropriate. Lord Morley ventures to hope therefore that on reconsideration, Sir E. Grey will agree with him that the proposal made by this Office was reasonable and moderate, and that it should be carried into effect. The Under Secretary of State, (Signed) C. G. Campbell.

I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 15th September (32,790/10) with its enclosure further respecting the proposal of the Secretary of State for India that the annual payment of 4,087L 105. by India to the Imperial Exchequer in advance of the adjustment based on the actual expenditure of the two Governments should be abandoned. In reply I am to state that My Lords regret that they are unable to assent to this proposal. They agree with the views expressed in the letter from your Department to the India Office of the 3rd May last (10,695/10j, . and think that the reasons therein given sufficiently justify a refusal to acquiesce in a partial revision of existing arrangements.

Note by Financial Department, dated 8 th February 1911 (Political 2891). (N.B .—The appendices referred to below have not been printed for the purposes of this Memorandum.) It is true as stated in our letter of the 25th June 1909, that the cost of the Baghdad Residency was taken into account in making the arrangement of 1900. What has been discovered since that letter was written is that—despite this fact, and despite the intention of the Welby Commission that Diplomatic and Consular expenditure on the Persian Mission and certain minor con sulates (which included Turkish Arabia), should be equally shared between the two Governments—the effect of their actual recommendation (i.e., that the contribution of 7,000k a year previously paid by this Office to the Foreign Office should be reduced to 2,000k a year), was to leave this Office to bear unaided a considerable portion of the total expenditure. The explanation of this paradox is as follows : — (1) In his answer to questions 12,413-4,' ::: - put by the Welby Commission, # A i ■ T j. jv * x Sir H. Waterfield submitted a state- * Appendix I. to this note. ,+ / • , x ^ i^ tt i ^ t Appendix 2 to this note. ment T (pnnted at pages 413-4, Vol. II, of the Report) showing :— I.

Average expenditure by India in Persia and Turkish Arabia but including an annual contribution of 7,000k to Foreign Office - 30,522 Sir H. Waterfield remarked that as the Foreign Office was receiving 7,000k a year from the India Office their gross expenditure must be reduced by that amount to arrive at their correct outlay. But in reply to a later question (questions 14,986-7)+ Sir H. Waterfield X Appendix 3 to this Note. seems to have overlooked the fact that 7,000k a year ought to be deducted from the gross outlay of the Foreign Office to arrive at their net outlay. For he stated that in order to divide expenditure equally between the Foreign Office and the India Office the contribution of 7,000h a year should be reduced to about 2,650k I he process by which he arrived at this figure was plainly as follows :— India Office expenditure (including contribution of 7,000k to Foreign Office) - - 30,522 Foreign Office expenditure (neglecting receipt from India Office) - - - _ 21,825 Excess of Indian expenditure half of this - 4,348 and deducting this sum from 7,000/. the remainder is 2,652/.J t will be seen that, if the 7 OOOZ. contributed by the India Office had been very U clifferent” 8r ° SS F ° reign ° ffice outla y. the result would have The calculation would then have been : Indian expenditure - _ _ Foreign Office expenditure (21,825^-7,0001; Excess expenditure by India Half this excess - - _ _ £ - 30,522 14,825 - 15,697 7,848 If the contribution of 7,OOOZ. to the Foreign Office had been reduced b\ this sura, it would have been converted into a contribution from the Foreign Office to India of 8480 £ fuither correction necessary to equalise expenditure was the omission from the Foreign Office figures of annual expenditure in accordance with the * Appendix 4 to this iSTote. recommendations of the Commission „ 0007 . ...... (paragraph 246 of their Report*) of a sum ol 8ddfi included on account of the Karun River subsidy. The Com mission recommended that the Basra-Baghdad subsidy paid by India should be regarded as the equivalent of the Karun subsidy paid by the Foreign Office. Sir Henry Waterfield was not, of course, responsible for the omission of this further correction. With this correction it will be seen that the expenditure met by India was greater than that met by the Foreign Office by 16,530L (15,697L, as above-f- 833L), and that, to equalise matters our contribution of 7,OOOZ a year to the Foreign Office ought to have been 16,530 reduced by £ ^ -- 8,*265Z. (he., turned into a contribution by the Foreign Office to us of 1,265Z.) As a matter of fact the Royal Commission recommended! a reduction of our contribution by 5,OOOZ. or 3,265Z. short of what the reduction should have been, and India was thus left to bear alone an annual expenditure of 3,265Z.

I agree as to the alterations in the draft letter. A. Hirtzel. 9. Note by Financial Department, India Office (Political 4213). Political Secretary, I attach a copy of an unofficial letterjj from this Department to the Treasury and dated 11th January. The matter was subsequently discussed by Mr. Robinson of this Department ' ' ° ' and Mr. Behrens of the Treasury. It was pointed out on behalf of this Office that the proposal which we had made would not involve any alteration in the agreement of 1900 : that we had no wish to be let off the annual payment of 4087/. 10s. (to which that of 6,000/,6&amp;? 13 agreed upon in 1900 was subsequently reduced), and that our proposal related only to the time at which the payment of that sum in respect of any given year should be made—our view being that it would now be reasonable and appropriate to make it at the same time as we receive the sums now paid * by the Foreign Office in respect of that given year. Mr. Behrens said that the Treasury were entirely opposed to the change suggested. He did not deny that the existing system gives the Treasury the advantage of the interest on T087L 10s. continuously. But he held that the procedure under which the time of payment of this sum is fixed, was decided upon as an outcome of the Agreement of 1900, and that so long as that Agreement remains in force the Treasury are entitled to any benefit which the procedure may give them. In view of the attitude taken up by the Treasury, there does not appear to be any use in pursuing the subject further at present, and the matter must, I think, now be dropped. Does the Political Secretary concur? F. W. Newmarch. 9th Februar}^ 1911. Copy of Unofficial Letter to Mr. Wilkins of the Treasury. India Office, Whitehall, S.W., Dear Wilkins, 11th January 1911. You may remember that in 1904 you and Abrahams arranged the procedure to be adopted in adjusting the pajunents by this Office to the Foreign Office in respect of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in con nection with Persia and various minor consulates. The procedure is set forth in Treasury letter to the Foreign Office of 16th January 1904, No. 19,089/03 (Annex to Enclosure 2 of Political Despatch No. 75, dated 29th July 1904, of which a copy is attached), and in subsequent letters, and is as follows :— In any given year (say A), India is to pay to the Foreign Office 4,087h 10,5. in respect of that year (-—6,0000, less a permanent reduction of 1,9120 10s. for which see India Office letter of 27th July 1904, Enclosure 8, to the above-mentioned Despatch), plus or minus an adjustment in respect of the financial year but one before the given year (say B), the plus portion consisting of half of any net increase in the Foreign Office expenditure in year (B), as compared with September 1900, and the minus portion consisting of half any net increases in Indian expenditure in year (B), as compared with that at September 1900. The transactions therefore fail into two parts, viz. :—(1) a payment in respect of the given year (A), and (2) an adjustment in respect of the earlier year (B). At the time when this arrangement was made, the adjustment m respect of year (B), though consisting of a refund to this Office, was smallei than the payment to the Foreign Office in respect of year (A). For some years, however, the situation has been completely changed, the amount of the lefund being far in excess of the payment in respect of year A. For example, in 1907-08 we paid the Foreign Office 4,087L 10s. m respect of that year (receiving at the same time a refund of 7,4700 16s. fiom them m respect of the year 1905—06j, whilst m 1909—10 we iecei\ed a refund of 16,8180 Ss. Sd. in respect of the year 1907-08 (paying at the same time 4,0870 10s. in respect of 1909-10. _ , It seems to us that the procedure of making a fixed payment o^ 4,08 i 0 10s. to the Foreign Office m respect of a gi\en year, though originally quite appropriate, is no longer so, now that a very much largei payment is really due from the Foreign Office to us. _ i These views were set forth in letters to the Foieign Office dated 19th March and 8th September last, of which I attach copies, but have met with an un favourable reception from them and you (see your lettei to the roieign office dated 2nd November 1910, No. 17037/10 (39,976)). I think there must be some misconception as to what it is we are asking and why , and, as you were concerned in the drafting of the original arrangement, I am writing to you unofficially in the hope that you may take the view that our request is a reasonable one, and that, if we renew it, it may be agieed to. 15583. DIt is apparently thought that we are asking for a modification of the agree ment of 1900, but this is not so. We do not wish to escape the liability of the 4,087b 10s., but we think that it would be convenient and appropriate that the payment from the India Office to the Foreign Office in respect of any given year (Part (1) of your arrangement) should be made at the same time as the payment by the Foreign Office to the India Office in respect of that year (Fart (2) of your arrangement), i.e., in the next year but one after the comple tion of the given year. Don’t you think our proposal reasonable ? As matters stand our expenses in Persia are at present between 30,000b and 40,000b a year greater than those of the Foreign Office and, though this discrepancy is about to be largely reduced owing to reductions and transfers, yet our expenditure in future is certain still to exceed that of the Foreign Office, but the refund by the Foreign Office to us in respect of that excess of expenditure will continue to be made if matters go on as they are between one and two years afterwards; and it seems unreasonable that we should be required to make our payment of 4,087b 10s. at an earlier date than the Foreign Office refund to ns is made. The immediate effect of compliance with our request would be that our payments of 4,087/. 10s. in respect of the years 1910-11 and 1911-12, which would under present arrangements be made in those years, would be post poned in each case for two years, with the result that the Foreign Office payments to us in those years would be correspondingly increased, but the net final result of the transactions would of course be unaffected. I hope I have made my point clear ? Yours sincerely, W. Robinson. 10. Minute by Political Department, India Office, dated 11th February 1911 (Political 4213). At the instance of the Financial Department, the question was raised of the propriety of making the Foreign Office an annual advance of 4,087b 10,§. two years before the money is rightly due in connection with the adjustment of the accounts of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia. The Treasury have expressed themselves unwilling to accept our view, on the ground that the arrangement was the outcome of an Agreement of 1900, which is still in force. On the reference paper below, the Financial Department advise that there does not appear to be any use in pursuing the subject further at present. Submission. It is submitted that in accordance with the view of the Financial Department the question of the propriety of making to the Foreign Office the annual advance of 4,087/. 10s. be for the present dropped. Approved Council 28th February 1911. 11. Extract from letter from India Office to Foreign Office, 25th February 1911. As regards the incidence of expenditure at Bagdad (vide ante-penulti mate paragraph of Sir Charles Hardinge’s letter above quoted, I am to inclose a Memorandum from which it will be seen that, despite the intention of the Agreement of 1900, the effect of that Instrument has been to throw on Indian revenues in respect of Persia and Turkish Arabia an excess charge which more than covers the expenditure on the Bagdad Residency. While therefore Lord Crewe is not less anxious than Sir E. Grey to reduce expenditure he is strongly of opinion that in the present conflict of international interests in the middle East this cannot be regarded as the paramount consideration. R.

It would probably be bad policy for us, financially, to take over the whole cost of Consulates at present run by us on condition that Foreign Office took over v/hole cost of those run by them, seeing that ours are run on so much more costly a scale. For example a Consulate which on Foreign Office scale would cost £5,000 would in our hands cost perhaps £ 10,000 - at least this seems to be my impression, subject to correction. Our salaries are much higher and most other charges are, I ’ think, distinctly higher. (Mr. Garrett will verify this). If I am right it pays us much better to meet half^ of cosw of our expensive Consulates and half of that of the cheaper&lt;~:Foreign Office ones, even including the Embassy/Than to m&lt; meet the whole cost of ours. ( 2 ). I cannot myself think of any more satisfactory basis of division, if we do share the charges, than the present half and half basis. The Wei by Commission said that as regards new charges each Govern ment shall seek the consent of the other, and it is open to’ &lt;? to us under this arrangement to challenge any item of expenditure either as unnecessary or undesirable. But it might conceivably be appropriate to decline at the outset to be liable for any snare of expenditure falling under • certain classes - say, for example, Secret Service expenditure %o maiHatiH maintain the good will of tribes or people on the Russian side of N.W.Persia. I do not say that this is an ideal example. Mr. Shuckburgh could probably suggest better. But the question whether we ought to insist from the outset on any exclusion of classes of expenditure is of course arguable. (3) . The political effect of the war and its results on Persia ana surrounding countries and India would have to be considered in order to see whether there is ground for disturbing the haltjl and half basis. (4) . The extent to which Diplomatic and Consular expenditure is being shared in otner Asiatic countries than Persia by the India and Home Exchequers ought, I think, to be considered in arriving at any settlement regarding Persia* For example (a) igre axe the whole cost of such expenditure at Muscat and ying t nrem. scope or tne Weiby _ given some particulars as to expenditure on it in my printed note of 1911).

(SD*) f.ROBINSON* 24. 6* 1919.Since joining my appointment in this country, I have seen various large sums of money appropriated out of the revenues of British India towards expenditure in Persia. This expenditure does not fall within the terms of the Welby Report and I took occasion to enter my respectful dissent against it. I think, however, the question is too serious to be dealt with in that way and, availing myself of your kind permission, I am taking the liberty to record my reasons as to why I object to this expenditure. In the first place, I am not at all satisfied as to the legal position. Sec. 22 of the Government of India Act precludes us from appropriating the revenues of India towards defraying the expenses of any Military operation carried on beyond the external frontiers of India without the consent of both Houses of Parliament. I see it'has been contended that the recent expenses in Persia do not fall under this head, but they are expenses M incurred on account of the government of India”, as provided in clause 3 of Sec. 20 of the statute; and the government of India has been construed to cover the maintenance in Persia of a Government friendly to England, and therefore beneficial to India, and the words ’‘government of India” have be-en extended to mean ”the eventual good government of India'. I respectfully submit that this interpretation is not warranted by the statute, for if it was, any expenditure anywhere in the Empire would be covered by the statute; except probably direct expenditure on military operations outside India which come expressly under Sec. 22 of the statute. Por instance, the loans granted by Great Britain to our Allies during the war were necessary for the preservation of the Empire of2 of which India is a part and therefore 'for the eventual good government of India' and India might, if this interpretation is correct, he called upon to make a substantial or an equal contricution towards these loans, without the assent of Parliament or an equal and merely by the executive action of the Secretary of State. It is also to be noted that the words M government of India' used in Sec. 20 of the statute are not synonymous with the Indian Government, for the word 'government' in the particular clause * begins with a small 'g' whereas wherever in the statute the Government is referred to as His Majesty’s Government of India, it begins as it ought to with a. capital 'G'. Moreover if the extended interpretation of the statute were correct, there would be hardly any necessity for the subsequent limitation of the powers of the Secretary of State, by Sec.22 , as regards expenditure on military operations outside India, for such operations may be and sometimes are, more necessary for 'the eventual good government of India', than probably our intervention in Persia. It seems to me, therefore, that Sec.20, limits the Secretary of State to expenditure necessary for the purpose of carrying on the work of government in India. If the view that I take of our legal limitations is correct, it would put an end to the controversy. But I may be wrong and I shall therefore place before you the general grounds on which the Persian contribution ought not to be supported. I see that the Government of India had raised the question before and Sir Thomas Holderness, with his characteristic sense of fairness, thought that 'it was still an unsettled question how far Indian revenues 'should, as a permanent arrangement, share equally with the 'Treasury expenditure of every kind incurred by His Majesty’s 'Government in Persia'. Mr. Chamberlain, I regret to find, did not share this view - he observed that 'the true and the 'only ground for such subsidies, is that it is of primary 'importance to India that Persia should he sufficiently well governed'governed to prevent her from becoming a danger to India 'through Afghanistan. Were it not for India, we should not to-day 'have a man in Persia or up the Gulf, and India is fortunate in 'her bargain'. Mr. Chamberlain*s observations are naturally entitled to great weight, and if his position is correct, there is no question that India should bear the whole burden, and it is an act of supreme generosity towards her that the British Treasury is bearing half the cost. I am prepared to concede for the moment that in considering this question India for herself need not be considered, that it is no concern to the United Kingdom whether the Indians who are British subjects should have the protection of Great Britain when threatened by a foreign Power, except at their own cost. I shall approach, the question purely from the British point of view. I take leave to quote from what one of Mr. Chamberlain’s distinguished colleagues in the War Cabinet had said of India in relation to the British Empire. Lord Curzon observed in one of his speeches in this country as follows rt India was the pivot of our Empire. If this Empire lost any 'other part of its dominions, we could survive, but if we lost India, the sun of our Empire would be set.' This is not a mere figure of speech. The wealth and consequently the material prosperity which the East India Company brought to England in the 18th century is well known. Not to go into the past, the value of the export trade of Great Britain to India for the year 1913 was £70.000.000 sterling deluding government stores and bullion, and the value of imports £48.000.000, practically wholly consisting of foodstuffs and raw materials. Apart from this, we must take into account the employment of British capital, in India«and of men of British descent: India’s home charges alone that is contribut&amp;dftira,■ektypo cEngland; amounts t&lt; ) 0.000 a year, equal to one-fifth of the total revenue of , I do not raise the question o: £21 quid pro quo' point4 point to these figures to show the enormous interest of England in India. Moreover India has contributed very materially in another way: India furnishes an excellent training ground for the British soldier, for whose training and equipment she pays: some of the greatest soldiers of the Empire, Wellington and Roberts were trained in India and the Indian Army maintained by India largely in excess of her own needs has been repeatedly used for Imperial purposes. That our German enemies correctly estimated the value of India to the Empire is evidenced by their efforts to cause trouble in India both externally and internally, though they professed and proclaimed that the war would be decided on the-western front. Eor they knew that if they could strike India, they would strike the Empire at its vital part. x Would England contemplate with equanimity, even if India were out of the way, if Persia and the Persian Gulf were in hostile hands during the war? What safety would there be for our communications,not with India alone, but with British East Africa, the Further East, Australia and New Zealand^ so that the safety of Persia, the necessity of maintaining order there and a pro-British administration was vital to the Empire and to India only as a part of the Empire. The Welby Commission decided that the consular expenses in Persia should be borne equally by India and the United Kingdom. These charges did not amount to much, but then it was felt in India that this was an unjust distribution. As Lord Cromer pointed out, M for some purposes, namely of H contribution, India was treated as an equal partner with 'Great Britain in the burden of the Empire, and for other 'purposes, namely India’s share in the management of concerns 'to which she contributed, India was treated as a dependency 'with no voice at all'. It is well known that for years past and not so veryvery long ago, Russia entertained designs on India and she was near the Indian border. India as an integral part of the Empire was vitally concerned in Russian affairs and it might be contended that she /ought 'for her eventual good government' to contribute towards the consulate in Russia and also on similar grounds to that in Constantinople. The real test is not whether India is interested in these establishments and vitally interested as a*British possession but whether the expenditure is for Indian services or purposes in India. Judged by this test, would it fair to r&gt; charge India for expenditure incurred in Persia for Imperial purposes? It is interesting to note that a Select Committee of the Houses of Parliament which sat in 1880 to enquire into Diplomatic and Consular establishments, fixed the Indian z - contribution at £ 10.000 a year, which was further reduced in 1891 by the Foreign Office Conference which met under the presidency of the late Lord Salisbury, to £7000 a year. f • / c .. t,.... , This clearly shows that British statesmen felt that the imposition on India was unjust. The decision of the Welby Commission, which rested on no argument but that of expediency, need not now be challenged, but its extension cannot be supported. It should not also be forgotten that if India has an interest in Persia, her means are not co-extensive with the United Kingdom; liabilities as between partners, even if India were in any sense a partner of England, must be determined by capacity; but when as the fact is, the Indian government is dependent, she should not only be saddled with the disabilities of dependence, but must be allowed some of its advantages and be free from some of the burdens of independence. So far, however, as the expenditure during the war is concerned, it cannot be questioned that it was the outcome ofof the war in Europe. Germany would not have intrigued in Persia or threatened that country but for the war in Europe and if Germany were successful in Persia and overran India as invaders, India would no doubt perish, but the whole Empire would be involved in her ruin. In conclusion, while I feel bound to protest against Indian revenues being employed by executive orders unknown to Parliament or the people in India in a manner which I think is not justified by law and is not certainly justified by the justice of the case, I do not say that India would not have voluntarily in the crisis through which we have passed borne a part of the war expenditure in Persia; but then she would have made the offer in the light of the day and in the face of the world, an offer which would be treated as special and would add to her dignity and position as a comoonent part of the Empire.Persia: Division of Charges. 1. In August lJ16 tlio fescmtciiy oi Stute Inul before Council u note (P 3839/16) prepared in the Political Department, giving information as to existing relations between the Government of India and tlie Home Government in reflation to Persia leisiau policy and l eisicin expenditure. J lie note described the general position as follows:— In 1399 the Government of India described Anglo-Indian interests in Persia as commercial, political, strategical and telegraphic. Much of the British trade, particularly in the south and east, is with British India, while the north and west avenues of entry are devoted in the mam to commercial connections with the British Isles. The political interests of Great Britain in leisia, win on, at then revival a century ago, were mainly Indian m inception, aie still largely Indian in character. The strategical interests arise from conditions with which India is most intimately concerned, and in recent years Persia (and especially Southern Persia) has assumed a strategical importance in relation to British India which- tends to increase rather than diminish. The telegraphic interests may be said to be equally divided between the mother-country and India. The Consular officers in Southern Persia (and at Meshed) are, by agreement with the Foreign Office, members of the Indian Political Department, and in their political capacity report to the Government of India.” 2. In paragraph 242 of the Report of the Indian Expenditure Commission (1900), better known as the “ Welby Commission,” the following opinion was expressed : —“ The two Governments are not agreed as to the extent of their “ respective interests in Persia. It is, in our opinion, desirable to adopt a general “ principle of division which will put an end to these discussions. Both countries have “ admittedly a large interest in Persia, and we think that the charges of the Mission “ and Consulates should be evenly divided between the two countries.” The reason why this principle was applied to diplomatic and consular expenditure only was presumably because there was at first no other charge necessitating a division. From 1890 to 1900 India had contributed a moiety of the Karim subsidy (2,000?. per annum), but, on the recommendation of the Welby Commission (Report, para graph 246), the whole subsidy was, after 1900, defrayed from Imperial revenues as a set off to the Baghdad-Basra mail subsidy paid by India. 3. Since 1900 the principle of-equal di vision has repeatedly been put into practice. Apart from interest-bearing loans to a very considerable amount, in all of which w'e took our share, we have frequently contributed towards expenditure forming no part of the “charges of the Mission and Consulates,” e.g., (I) we paid half the expenses of the British section of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, and even shared in the compensation paid to the Secretary to the British Commissioners (a foreign Office officer) for injuries sustained while on duty ; (2) we have shared the ^ monthly advances made to the Persian Government under the so-called “Moratorium scheme, and also (3) certain payments made to the British Minister at Tehran lor. secret service purposes j and (4) we have contributed to various subsidies paid to diffeient individuals and tribes in Persia, both before and during the present war. 4. The question of the incidence of Persian charges was caiefully ic-examined a 1917 in connection with the cost of the South Persia Rilles and of the Scistan ievv Corps. It was exhaustively discussed in a Memorandum piepaied by the mancial Department of the India Office (dated the 15th September 1917) of which copy is annexed to this Note. Ihe conclusion reached was that, while t re cost o he levies raised in Seistan was properly chargeable to imperial revenues, as foiming iart of expenditure on military operations in Persia, 1 the cost of the South leisia lilies, of subsidies and loans during the war, and oi secret service expenditure, so 1 Under the terms of the Parliamentary Resolutions of November 1914, Imperial revenues bear all the extraordinary ” charges of Indian troops employed on military operations out of India.far as not required for purely military purposes, should be equally divided. This view was accepted by the Secretary of State in Council, and the Foreign Office were informed accordingly on the /th November 1017. 5. Certain other cases not directly covered by the above decisions have since come up for consideration, e.rj .:— (1) Relief measures at Shiraz, Meshed, Tehran, and ITamadan. In each case the Secretary of State in Council has agreed to bear half the cost, (2) The construction of the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road and telegraph line. The Secretary of State in Council has proposed to the'Foreign Office that an outlay of 60,0001. on the former, and of 50,000L on the latter, should be equally shared between the British and Indian Exchequers. Secretary of State (Mr. Chamberlain) on the 22nd June 1916 : following note was recorded by the late have no doubt that they the Welby Commission] intended future Persian charges to be settled on the half-and-half principle, though some existing charges were balanced against one another .... This war and our recent experiences have demonstrated more clearly than ever before that nothing which touches Persia is alien to India .... The true and the only ground for such subsidies, and one which is quite conclusive in the present case, is that it is of primary importance to India that Persia should be sufficiently well governed to prevent her from ecoming a danger to India through Afghanistan. Anyone who reads the draft Mesopotamian Blue Book or who has followed the constant pre-occupation of the Indian Government as to the repercussion of Persian events on Indian security will, I feel sure, admit the force of this argument. Its force is especially manifest in times like the present; but if India be so deeply concerned in Persian politics in a crisis, it cannot wash its hands of Persian charges the moment the crisis passes. Were it not for India, we shoidd not to-day have a man in Persia or up the Gulf, and India is fortunate in her bargain. I would therefore accept half charges.” Political Department. India Office, 9th October 1918. l*r*,'x* 4 id]Confidential. Incidence of (1) Cost of South Persia Rifles and (-2) Political Expenditure in Persia. NoteS l&gt;U Sec . retar y’ Financial Department, and Legal Adviser, India Office, on Viceroy s t inanee Department telegram of Sth June 1917 '* Xoie by Secretary, Financial Department, India Office, dated 15th September 1917. I regret the delay in replying to your reference. This has been due to the necessity for very careful examination of the questions at issue, and to the difficulty of finding time for such examination, entailing the perusal ol a large mass of correspondence, in the pressure of other work. 2. The Comptroller and Auditor-General in India has challenged as unfair to India the arrangement come to with the Treasury more than a year ago regarding the incidence of expenditure on the South Persian Rifles and has won over the Government of India to his view. As you are aware’ the Ireasury are not very willing to bear their share of even this arrange ment as the items of actual outlay have never been submitted to them for loimal sanction. If the Comptroller-GeneraTs view were correct it would be necessary, in respect of 1916-17 alone, to claim a further sum—according to the latest figures we have had from India—of 300,000k, and in 1917-18 the amount w ould presumably be much larger. Moreover the cognate questions of the incidence of the subsidies and loans given to Persia during the war, and of expenditure on the Seistan Militia and Secret Service have all been brought under review by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and require to lie definitely settled. It is necessary therefore to be very sure of our ground before deciding on the course to be taken. 3. To do justice to these questions, it is necessary to consider the position before the war, as between India and the Imperial Government,'in regard to expenditure in Persia. Diplomatic and consular expenditure pure and simple was shared on an equal basis, in accordance with the recommenda tions of the Welby Commission ; but this principle was in practice also applied to expenditure of various kinds intended for the furtherance of the stability of Persia, e.g., various loans of considerable sums. The cost of certain troops from India actually employed in Persia when war broke out was thus shared. The question whether expenditure not definitely coming under the head of “ diplomatic and consular ” is strictly governed by the Welby Report was raised by Mr. Ne win arch in a Note of 10th June 19i6 in connection with a proposed Anglo-Russian loan of 480,000k a year. Sir Arthur Hirtzel considered that, “ whatever the original intention, we are too “ far committed by our action in the past to press on the Treasury with any &lt;£ hope of success the narrower view of our commitments in Persia ” ; he added that since the war we had shared the cost of numerous special advances, subsidies, &amp;c. Sir Thomas Holderness thought it to be a still unsettled question how far Indian revenues should, as a permanent arrangement, share equally with the Treasury expenditure of every kind incurred by His Majesty’s Government in Persia. He referred to LordMorley's strong views in the contrary sense, hut considered that while the war is on India is yitally interested in keeping Persia quiet and maintaining an Anglophile Government, and that acceptance of the half-and-half rule in the case then under discussion and in similar future cases would be iustified. Mr. Chamberlain did not share Sir Thomas’s reservation. “ The u true and the only ground, he saicl, for such subsidies, and one which is quite conclusive in°the present case, is that it is of primary importance to India that Persia should be sufficiently well governed to prevent her fiom ‘ becoming a danger to India through Afghanistan. - - • But if 1‘ India be so deeply concerned m Persian politics m a cus^, it cannot v\ash tt its hands of Persian charges the moment the crisis is passed. Were it not m for India, we should not to-day have a man in Persia or up the Gulf, and “ India is fortunate m her bargain. 4. Such was the position when war broke out. sums of money have been spent in Persia on During the war large (1) Operations of Indian Troops. (2) Subsidies and Loans. (3) Secret Service. (4) Seistan Levies. (5) South Persia Rifles. 5. As regards expenditure on the first of these categories, we obtained the agreement of the Treasury to depart from the pre-war division of cost, and to charge—as the Comptroller and Auditor-Geneial thinks we ought to do in the case of the expenditure of the remaining categories—the whole of the extraordinary outlay to the Imperial Government. Our action was influenced by the fact that the cost of the Indian Expeditionary Forces in various parte of the world is being shared on the basis of the Parliamentary Resolutions, the ordinary outlay being borne by India, the extraordinary by Ilis Majesty’s Government. 6. The considerations wdiich impelled us to preserve the half-and-half division in the case of expenditure under category 2 [Subsidies and Loans~\ have been set forth above in recording the discussion raised by Mr. Newmarch. 7. We have proposed to the Foreign Office that outlay on category 3 [Secret Service] should be diyided according to the half-and-half rule, but the matter has not yet been settled. 8. As regards category 4 [Seistan Levy Corps], I expressed the opinion in a note of 7tli November 1916 that if the Seistan Levies formed a component part of the troops in Seistan, and were not a body formed independently and leading a separate existence, the Parliamentary Resolutions might properly be applied to them. A proposal to this effect was put to the Government of India in our telegram of 16th November ; it is this telegram which has elicited the warm approval of the Government of India and the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and has caused the latter to suggest that, for the reasons given in their telegram under consideration, the expenditure under categories 2, 3 and 5 should be divided in the same way. I venture to differ for the following reasons 9. Subsidies and, Loans. —I share the view expressed by Mr. Chamberlain (see paragraph 3). See also concluding paragraphs of what I say below regarding South Persia Rifles. 10. Secret Service. —In so far as expenditure under this head is intimately connected with the military operations, its incidence ought to follow that of the cost of those operations. The Government of India recognises this [Mr. Grant’s letter of 19th November 1915, Pol. 4586/15]. Otherwise, for the reasons given in the notes evoked by Mr. Newmarch’s question, I think that the half-and-half principle should clearly be followed. certain tele, Percy ^ Sir s w the incid ■ hawing our at the timer not really si facility of es tele prei opei offic may will coil! regi dele “War' bye opei wisl once pris offer “ Pleaf&lt; of : Tele pury expe It will be (i) U (ii) Tin , A1 N Loc (i ? ) Irr ( refer,certain fi Gow P t l' 0 % and Auditor-General quotes certain te.egiains in March 1916 as showing the immediate obieet of Sn ercy cvices s Mission and the Force raised by him locally These telegrams were contemporaneous with our proposal to the Foreign Office as to the incidence of cost of the Force, so that Sir Richard Gamble is not ft a the n Im°e' h nAm t0 ^T 8 ^ C °i d hare el ' ded observation at the time hen that proposal was made.

Sykes should report with least possible dela} T . War Committee think German activity can be most effectively met by counter-activity of similar kind. Apart, therefore, from above operations, which are dependent on nature of Sykes’s report, they wish recruitment of Irregular Force in Seistan proceeded with at once. They consider that such force, led by active and enter prising officers, and 'stiffened by cavalry now there, could take offensive in detachments and hunt down German parties. “ Please suggest names of officers and I will ask War Office for release of any under them. Could not employes of Indo-European Telegraph Department and Imperial Bank he used tor this purpose, and younger civil political officers with some military experience? . . . .” It will be seen that this telegram deals with four forces,— (i) The Kawam’s men. (ii) The Indian troops proposed to be sent from Egypt for Bunder Abbas. (iii) Local force proposed to be recruited under Kawam’s authority. (iv) Irregular Force in Seistan. No reference is made to the South Persia Military Police. (2) Telegram from Secretary of Stale to Viceroy, 31st March 1916. “ My telegram 2nd March.

Cf. telegram from Officer Commanding, 454, of 4th February.” The portions of the telegram of 2nd March to which this telegram relates, deal only with the recruitment of the irregular Force [in Seistan], (3) Concluding portion of Viceroy s telegram of lOtli March 1910,434 D.S. “ We are arranging to send as soon as possible 4,000 old serviceable rifles, and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition, to be delivered by Sykes to Kawam’s representative. in circumstances explained, it appears undesirable to press Kawam to await Sykes’s arrival, or to press him further to accept assistance of British officers at this stage. He is evidently averse to presence of British officers with his Force and he must be best judge of situation, although there is doubtless considerable force in arguments put forward in Minister at Tehran’s telegram Xo. 33, Gth March, to London Foreign Office. We think, therefore, that Sykes should simply go to Bunder Abbas and begin to raise Military Police l ? orce, which, as soon as sufficiently trained, could either co-operate with Kawam on Fars side, or advance on Kerman with a view to ousting Germans from there, and eventually linking up with Seistan Forces. Sykes agrees that location of the Force mentioned in your telegram of 22nd instant [3294] at Bunder Abbas would serve no useful purpose at present, but only tend to act as irritant, and imperil the success of his undertaking.” [This telegram does definitely refer to South Persia Military Police, and proposes for them a quasi-military character. 1 refer further to this point below.] (4) Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, 1 1th March 1916. “ Foreign Secret. Your telegram dated 10th March. Kawam. I agree. Please telegraph as soon as possible Cox’s proposals regarding military operations at Bushire with your views.” 12. Thus, of these four telegrams, No. 3 is the only one that definitely says anything about the South Persia Military Police. Surely it is more correct when considering the objects of that Force, to refer to the various other telegrams in which they were more definitely discussed and settled. I again quote (a) Telegram from Mr. Marling, 9th January 1916. “ 20. Persian Government are preparing scheme for augmenting Cossack Brigade to 10,000 men They would be armed with rifles taken from gendarmerie, and paid for out of Moratorium. 1 his project is to be included among terms of the general agreement between Persia and the two Powers, and Persian Government hope that under it provision will be made to finance this Force on a permanent basis. I have intimated to Persian Government that while His Majesty’s Government might agree to creation of such a Force to enable the Persian Government to assist Russian troops in dealing with existing situation, they would scarcely relish its employment in the South, and would certainly never admit that after war the only Force in Persia should be commanded by Russian trained officers. 1 hey would certainly demand that any Force that may be required to maintain order in the South, where British interests are so great, should be similarly under British influence ”(b) From Mr. Marling, 12th January 1910. “ My telegram No 20.

Persia. Cossack Ju igade.. We entirely agree as to desirability of maintaining- visible sign of British influence outside Russian sphere, and have always advocated raising of a force under British officers for that pm pose. A\ e think Colonel Sir P. Sykes, who is obviously best qualified, might - be appointed at once to organise and command a force of Military Police in Seistan, using the Hazaras, who have already been recruited, as a nucleus, and increasing their number by local recruitment Such a force, while extremely useful in the present juncture in Seistan, might gradually extend its sphere to Kerman, where farther enlistment might be made, eventually linking up with Bunder Abbas ” (e) From Government of India to Sir Percy Cox, 17th February 1916. “ 348 D.S Sykes’s deputation has for its primary object the raising of a force of Military Police in Southern Persia in order to maintain visible signs of our influence, and eventually, by expanding force to Kerman and over Southern Persia generally and linking up wdth nucleus already existing in Seistan, to provide machine for restoration of order.” These telegrams show that the increase of the Cossack Brigade, and the desirability of balancing this addition to Russian influence in the North, played a very important part in the institution of the South Persia Military Police ; but no reference is made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General to this aspect of the matter. Telegram (d) suggests that Sir Percy Sykes should begin operations in Seistan and work westwards to Bunder Abbas; but as events turned out he began recruitment in Bunder Abbas and the formation of a force in Seistan was dealt w ith by other officers and not by him. (f) From Mr. Marling, 23rd February 1916. 112 In my view our immediate mark should be to support Kawam, and lor this purpose I consider Sykes should get into touch wich Kawam as soon as possible, and wherever most convenient, and take with him men, arms.ammunition and money, and if possible a few small guns . . . . Formation of Military Police appears to me to be of secondary importance. It must necessarily take too long to be of any immediate use ” This was the course actually taken. Money, ammunition, rifles and guns were supplied to Kawarn. But the military operations proper, as I understand the position, were over before the South Persia Military Police began to take shape. This is shown by the following telegrams :— (g) From Sir P. Sykes to Government of India, 9th April 1916. “ Total collapse of Germans and rebels will presumably render further support to Kawam unnecessary. I suggest therefore that I should march police recruits to Kerman and organise force there. Bequest I may be given escort similar to that asked for in nw telegram 30 C, dated 6th April, and strongly recommended by Minister at Tehran in his telegram 46 F, dated 8th April. It is most desirable to avoid risk and be independent of recruits with only few weeks’ training, unfit to defend arms and ammunition. 1 have already recruited 300 men.” What active support Sir P. Sykes hoped to be able to give Kawam was apparently intended to come from an escort of Indian troops, for the Government of India, in sending the above telegram on, said :—“ Telegram “ 12th April 1916. We agree that Sykes should move forward as soon “ as possible, and for this purpose we have asked General Officer Com- “ manding, Force D, to despatch if possible at once to Bunder Abbas one “ Squadron Cavalry, one Section Mountain Guns, two Companies Infantry, “ one of which will replace present detachment from Maskat. Whether Sykes should move to join Kawam or Farman Farma, or proceed to “ Kerman, must depend on developments of Persian situation.” (h) From Deputy Political Resident in Persian Gulf to Government of India, 10th April 1916. u • • • • Following news received from variety of sources appears to confirm news that Shiraz has been occupied on behalf of Soidet and Kawam.” 13. It was at this period that we asked the Treasury, and they agreed, to pay half the cost of the South Persia Military Police. Our action seems to me to have been very appropriate. 14. if this view be confirmed, as I imagine it will be, by the Secretary of State in Council, the further question remains, whether the character of the opei ations in which the South Persia klilitary Police (or South Persia Rifles) have been engaged since April 1916, and the nature of its organisation, ha^o been such as to render the bargain we then made with the Treasury an illegal or unfair one, as the Comptroller and Auditor-General suggests. On the information before me m these files I personally do not think so. Jo. I he Government of India say in their present telegram that such local tioops as Sir Percy S t ykes was able to raise “were employed during ^ le P as ( year mainly in connection with military operations, and that our &lt;&lt; GG nec ^ on w ith force has been transferred on our side to Commander-in- ;hiel and to Army Department.” They also point to the present military organisation of the force. The question of the extent to which the opeiations of the force have been “military operations' in any of the accepted senses of the term is, I think, very arguable. The “ military operations for dealing with the German parties and the Gendarmerie ie Demon veie apparently carried out, as we have seen, by the forces under \ayam and Soulet, by the Seistan field Force (including the irregular ewes), and (possibly) by some of the Indian troops landed at Bunder Abbas ; not by the South Persia Military Police. So far as the South Persia Riflest have been actively employed, their fimctions, I presume, have consisted- no doubt m connection with military forces-in hunting down raidino- parties let loose by the general state of lawlessness in South Persia a condition of things aggravated, no doubt, by the war, and fostered by Geiman intrigue. What they have been doing may, correctly I think be ■described as of the nature of police duties in a time of war and unrest c/ the Government of India’s own telegram of 7th August 1916 where they say that the functions of the Force will be “mainly those of police or constabulary. 1 he fact that the Force has a military organisation does not seem to affect this. So has the Burma Military Police. For does it seem specially relevant to the point at issue, that its control has been transferred to the Gommander-in-Ohief. This is only natural, as the South Persia limes have to work in along with the purely military forces he administering. 16. H f^e operations of the South Persia Rifles are not “ military operations,” Section 2'2 of the Government of India.Act does not seem to apply- Moieover, that section relates to military operations carried on by “ His Majesty’s Forces charged upon ” the revenues of India, a phrase which does not seem to cover a local force raised in a country outside India. 17. If Section 22 of the Act does not apply, the Parliamentary Resolu tions have no relevance, and the one question to be considered from the point of view of the Act is whether the expenditure may be regarded as expenditure “for the purposes of the government of India alone” (Section 20 (1) of the Act). The question at issue here is the same as in the case of the loans and subsidies given to Persia both before and since the beginning of the war. It will be seen that the Comptroller and Auditor- General considers the true nature of the expenditure incurred in connection with the South Persia Rifles is that of a subsidy to the Persian Government, in pursuance of our policy for the successful conduct of the war against Germany and Turkey, and the Government of India do not fail to see that his objection applies equally to all the so-called political expenditure which is being incurred by the Imperial Government or by us in Persia in connection with the war. 18. In view of this challenge as to the legality, as well as fairness to India, of our contributions towards these subsidies and loans, as also towards the expenditure of the South Persia Rifles, it would be as well to ask the opinion of the Legal Adviser. Summary. Put briefly, my views on the questions dealt with in this important telegram are as follows :— 1. Seistan Levies.—The whole of the expenditure is chargeable to Imperial revenues for the reasons given in our telegram of 17th November and the Government of India’s present reply, subject to any credits for the ordinary cost of any officers or troops of the Indian Army lent to the Levies. If you concur, you will no doubt have a draft letter prepared to the I oreign Office, asking them to put the matter to the Treasury with a view to the necessary instructions being given to the War Office ; a copy of the letter might at the same time be forwarded to that Department. 2. South Persia Bifles .—My view is that, at the outset, the arrangement as to incidence which we made with th^ Treasury was both fair to India and legal, and that nothing that has happened since- so Jar as the papers before me indicate—has altered the position. If this view be accepted, a suitable reply to the Government of India will presumably be prepared in your Department. I suggest, however, that the opinion of the Lena I Adviser be taken in regard to these payments, and those under below.A very practical point is the necessity of persuading the Treasury to repay us one-half of the expenditure actually incurred on the South Persia Have you yet received from the Government of India a reasoned statement of that expenditure ? As matters stand the Treasury profess themselves unwilling to pay because their sanction to the various 'items of expenditure was not obtained. I presume that they will not maintain this attitude if satisfactory details of the scheme are once before them. It will be noted that the Government of India have stated that the purely military expenditure mixed up with Sir Percy Sykes’s expenditure is being separately charged to the Imperial Government in the War Accounts. 3. Secret Service Money, in so far as not required for Military Pur- poses.—The half-and-half principle seems legal and appropriate. The Government of India might be asked to submit their amended statement as soon as possible. It is not clear whether the objections made by the Comptroller and Auditor-General cover these payments. Perhaps not.' 4. Subsidies and Loans during 'present War. —The equal division seems to me reasonable and legal, but here again the opinion of the Legal Adviser might be taken. I5th September 191 W. Robinson. II. Note by Legal Adviser, India Office, dated 4th October 1917. i. The question at issue with the Government of India seems rather to be one of fact than of law, because it raises the point whether certain expenditure—c.r/., in connection with the South Persia Rifles, and the Persian subsidies and loans—fall within the operation of the Parliamentary Resolutions, and this point depends upon the nature of the expenditure, w lether it is to be regarded as civil expenditure incurred for the purposes 0 .... eventual good government of India, or whether it is in its essence military expenditure incurred for the purpose of military operations carried on beyond the external frontiers of His Majesty’s possessions. 7‘ ^ ie P 0 ’ 11 ^ mentioned is really a question of fact, upon which 1 am naii \ competent to express an opinion. I may say, however, that so far as can juc ge t le financial Secretary has succeeded in making out his case as regards the item of the South Persia Rifles. The expenditure under this lead does not seem to me to have been incurred for a military purpose. 3. If the same can be said as to the matter of the subsidies and loans, then 1 agree with his conclusion that the expenditure on this head also siould be regarded as civil expenditure undertaken for the purposes of the good government of India. 1 1 ^ P'°l l follow if these facts are conceded that the expenditure under ,?r. iLL 3 ’ T o 1 Un . n th ® P urview of Section 22 of the Government of india Act, but under Section 20 of that Act. 4th October'1917.

X x 1lelegram irom \ iceroy to Secretary of State, dated 27th October 1915. hi connection with European War we have sent additional troops to Muscat and to various parts of Persia not included within sphere of the operation of f oree “ D.” Expenses of these troops have been hitherto met from Indian levenues, but our Comptroller-General doubts whether this arrange ment is pmmissdde m view of provision of Section 22 of new Government of India Act. Haring regard to view recently taken by you in connection w ith incidence of charges of regulars transferred to Home establishment, w r e think that incidence of cost of above-mentioned troops should be governed by Houses of Parliament Resolutions of 26th November last. Usual arrangement m case of Persia in recent years lias been that entire expendi ture on Indian troops employed in connection with local disturbances, and apart from arms traffic operations has been shared in moieties between Imperial Government and Government of India (see your telegram dated 21st November 1912 regarding troops in Persia). It would seem, however, that this arrangement, which is in accordance with the Welby Commission’s recommendations, and wdiich would be more favourable to India than that now proposed by us, has been superseded for the period of war by resolution cited above. We should be glad to receive early instructions in the matter. Sir, E. 5722/15. India Office to Treasury. India Office, 20th January 1916. 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to forward, for the consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, Dated 27th October 1915. a C0 Py of a telegram 1 from the Govern ment of India regarding the incidence of cost of troops from the Indian establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the Avar. With reference to the concluding portion of the telegram Mr. Chamberlain is inclined to think that it is impossible to forecast with accuracy at the present stage whether a division of the charges on the basis of the Resolution of 26th November I914 2 Avould or - Copy enclosed.* would not be less favourable to the revenues of India (and more favourable to Imperial revenues) than a division in accordance with the pre-Avar arrangements, under Avliich India bore the full cost of the troops employed in Oman, and was normally liable for half of the cost of any troops employed in Persia otherwise than in the suppression of the aims traffic. The effect from this point of vieAv of the alteration of system Avoidd depend on the realised proportion of “ ordinary ” to “ extraordinary expenditure, the latter increasing with the expensiveness of the operations in which the troops are engaged. The troops at Bushire (one battalion of infantry and details), for example, and those at Chahbar (about 100 strong), Jask (about 200 strong), and Muscat (about 760 strong), are, and are likely to remain immobile, so that the extraordinary expenditure on them will probably be small, whereas the ti;oops in Seistan (about 600 infantry and 350 cavalry) are intended to be highly mobile. Mr. Chamberlain is of opinion, however, that a division of the charges in accordance with the Resolution of 26th November 1914, is appropriate in itself. This method of division has now been applied to the Indian troops operating in Erance, Egypt, Gallipoli, and East Africa; to the additional Indian regiment sent since the commencement of the war to See File 2. (g) July issue. 20888-15 B I m I 1Mauritius; and to the large body of regular British troops sent to Europe from India in exchange for Territorials. In a war extending to three continents which has called up the military resources of every part of the Empire, the presumption must be that any Indian troops engaged in operations beyond the external frontiers of India, or stationed in regions where such operations are in progress, come under the Resolution. Mr. Chamberlain assumes, therefore, that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will agree with him that the Resolution should be applied to the troops from the Indian establishment employed in Persia and Oman since the outbreak of the war. He will be glad to learn that this assumption is correct. I am, &amp;c., The Secretary, Treasury. T. W. Holder's ess No. 6128. Treasury to India Office. Treasury Ghambers 14th March 1916.

I am commanded by the iirmy Council to acknowledge receipt of your letter, No. 1909/16 of the 19th ultimo, regarding the incidence of cost of the troops from the Indian Establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the war. The Council agree with Their Lordships that, having regard to the substantial interest of India in Persia and Oman, there is no reason why the Imperial Government should bear the same share of the expenditure as in the case of the operations in France, and while the Council are unaware of the grounds on which the Treasury agreed to share equally between Imperial and Indian revenues the whole cost of the Indian troops employed in Southern Persia in 191 ! and thereafter, they do not think that those grounds should necessarily determine the incidence of cost under the totally different circumstances now prevailing. The Council consider that the case is one which should be dealt with by the transfer of a round sum based on estimate only, as Suggested in the case of Aden in War Office letter 0164/3310 A. (F. 1) of 6th January 1916, and approved in Treasury letter 507 of 17th February 1916. Holding this view, they consider that efforts should be made to dispense with detailed accounting between the Indian Government and the War Office at a time of pressure like the present; and, as the whole sum involved is not large in proportion to other military expenditure, they consider that the Government of India might reasonably be expected to bear the whole charges of these troops, currently, until such time as the question of the ultimate incidence of the expenditure can be dealt with. I am, &amp;c., The Secretary, Treasury. B. B. Cubitt. 4. India Office to Treasury. F. 3044. India Office, 27th July 1916. I am directed to reply as follows to Sir Robert Chalmers’ letter dated I4th March 1916, No. 6128, regarding the incidence of cost of troops from the Indian establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the Avar : — Alternative suggestions were made by the Treasury, viz :* [a) that Indian revenues should for the time being bear the .whole charges of these troops, leaving the question of ultimate incidence to be settled hereafter; 20888—15 • j -(b) that, as was agreed in the letter from this Office dated 19th April 191(), No. F. 2104 regarding troops from the Indian establishment employed at Aden, India shoo Id bear all the ordinary and half the extraordinary charges. Mr. Chamberlain would have been glad to be able to agree with one or other of the Lords Commissioners’ proposals for a settlement of this question, which is of no great financial importance ; but he is bound by the terms of Section 22 of the Government of India Act, 19 lo, o &amp; 0 Geo. \ ., c. 61 (corresponding the Section 55 of the Act of 185S, 21 A 22 4 ict., c. 100). The section prohibits the application of the revenues of India, save with the consent of both Houses of Parliament, to defray the cost of ^ military operations carried on beyond the external frontiers of 1 iis Majesty s Indian possessions by troops from the Indian Establishment. The only consent given in pursuance of the section in relation to troops employed in Oman and Persia is contained in the Resolutions passed on 26th November 1914, authorising the payment from Indian revenues of the ordinary (but no other) charges of troops despatched out of India for service in the war. This limitation does not apply to the troops at Aden, which is not beyond the external frontier of His Majesty’s Indian Possessions ; but it clearly applies to those now under discussion. Mr. Chamberlain is therefore compelled to press for the acceptance of the proposal in the letter from this Office of 20th January 1916, No. F. 5722. He hopes that their Lordships will see their way to agree to it. On hearing from them to this effect, he will arrange with the Army Council (to whose Department the matter seems to belong) a detailed scheme of adjustment. I have, &amp;c. The Secretary, Treasury.

The political interests of Great Britain in Persia, which, at their revival a. century ago, were mainly Indian in inception, are still largely Indian in character. The strategical interests arise from conditions with which India, is most intimately concerned, and in recent years Persia (and especially southern Persia,) has assumed a strategical importance in relation to British India, which tends to increase rather than diminish. The telegraphic interests may be said to be equally divided between the mo then-country and India. The Consular officers in southern Persia (and at Meshed) are, by agreement with the Foreign Office,( Members of the Indian Political Department , and in their political capacity report to the Government of India I Since the Y/elby Commission (1900) the principle of an equal division of expenditure has been generally acted upon. It is normally the invariable practice to consult the Government of India before accepting any charge on Indian revenues; and if, owing to the exigencies of the war, it has sometimes been necessary to dispense with this step, they are in sufficiently close communication with H.' .Minister, Tehran, (who has instructions to repeat all important telegrams to them) to be generally aware of what is in contemplation, -and to express their views on matters of policy before a decision is taken.

The Secretary of State asked them for their views, and they suoported it, telegraphing on 23rd February 1916 'We assume expenditure involved, so far as it cannot be passed on to Persian Government, will be shared between us and His Majesty’s Government in accordance with accepted principle'.

Secretary, Political Department. For favour of your observations. As regards Muscat, I understand that the pre-war situation was as follows:- Diplomatic and Consular expenditure at this place has for a considerable number of years been borne entirely by India, though I am not aware of the reasons why it shoulcf^be equally shared by the Imperial Government. Apart from such expenditure India has also borne the cost of a small Indian force stationed at Muscat for some time before the beginning of the present war, with the object of protecting the Sultan against attack by parties whose interests have been prejudiced by our Arms Traffic operations and by the arrangement made with him for its suppression in future. On the other hand the Foreign Office paid half the amount of the compensation given to French traders to buy them out. In Persia the pre-war situation was different, as the Imperial Government shared (in theory) all expenditure equally, including, latterly, the cost of any troops employed there. On this pre-war situation there has supervened (you will know the facts) the despatch of further troops from India to Muscat and Persia. Three methods of dealing with the question of incidence of cost of the troops employed since the outbreak of war (including those already in Persia and MuscatMuscat when war began) suggest themselves. (1) India - as hitherto - to pay the full cost of the troops at Muscat and half of the cost of the troops •* in Persia. (2) -as suggested by the Government of India - (a) As regards Muscat:- India to pay the full cost of the troops present on the outbreak of the war and the 'ordinary** cost of any troops subsequently despatched. (b) As regards Persia:- India to pay half the cost of the troops present at the outbreak of war and the 'ordinary** charges of the troops subsequently despatched. This is the arrangement proposed by the Government of India and sanctioned by the Secretary of State as regards the troops at Bushire incorporated in Force **D**. (Pol.3031/15, below). (3) Frofg the outbreak of the war India to pay the 'ordinary** charges of all troops employed at Muscat and in Persia. The third method is much the simplest, and seems to me to be best in accordance with the spirit of the Resolution. The case for it might be started thus:- Ordinarily we share equally all diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia: We pay in full such charges at Muscat. Very rarely we send organised bodies of troops (as distinguished from armed consular escorts) to Persia or Muscat; if to the former we pay half: if to the latter - as it has been on account of Arms Traffic - we have paid all. A state of war has supervened, and in addition to our diplomatic and consular establishments we are maintaining organised bodies of troops at Muscat and inPersia on a much larger scale. Simultaneously we have sent troops to various oilier parts of the world, France, Egypt, the Dardanelles, East Africa, and we have exchanged a large body of Regular British troops for a body of Territorials. In all these cases we have decided to bear the full ordinary' charges of the troops so despatched. In view of the situation elsewhere, the case for applying, either partially or entirely, to the troops in Persia and at Muscat, the division of charges customary in peace-time, loses force, and instead it seems to be reasonable that the division sanctioned by the Resolution should be applied to ail these troops, including those already incorporated in Force W D H . The question whether the arrangement I have sugg os would mean less expenditure by India than either of the others ought not, I think, to be a ruling consideration in to matter. It is not possible, indeed, to say definitely beforehand which of the three would mean less expense to us. As between (3) and (1), if the ”extraordinary” charges in Persia should prove to be more than the 'ordinary” we should gain in respect of that country as our portion (the 'ordinary”) would then be less than half the total. If, on the contrary, the 'extraordinary” should be less than the 'ordinary”, the 'half* and half' arrangement would suit us, financially, better than the universal application of the Resolutions. In the case of Muscat, of course, any division of the charges would pay us better than the pre-war arrangement. Our experience, so far, in the case of the Expeditionary Forces is that the 'extraordinary' charges are several times as great as the 'ordinary”. This might not apply at all to the troops in Persia and Muscat as they are presumablypresumably more stationary, but on the other hand there seem to be indications that times of greater activity are awaiting them. You are in a better position than I to judge if this^Likely to be the case. As between (3) and (2) the question seems to be practically the same in kind though different in degree. Supposing for example there was one regiment in Persia at the outbreak of war and x regiments were added subsequently, the incidence of the cost of the x regiments would he the same under (2) as under (3), and the only point in doubt would be whether it would be cheaper for us to deal with the one regiment on the half and half basis or on the basis of the Resolutions. If the regiment remained practically inactive during the war former basis would probably be the cheaper, but if it ved about and the extraordinary charges increased, the latter would suit us better. But, as I have said above, I do not think that the questionwhether we should gain or lose ought to be the governing one. Before drafting a letter to the Treasury I should be glad to be favoured with your views. (Sd.) W.Robinson. 26.11.15. As to the facts. The rebellion in Oman began in 1913 and troops have been there continuously since July of that year. A period of tranquillity in the summer of 1914 was succeeded by a recrudescence of the rebellion at the beginning of November 1914, and reinforcements were sent* There is a certain amount of evidence to connect the recrudescence with German intrigue and the attitude of TurkeyTurkey. As regards Persia, the heightened degree of unrest for which the war is partly responsible has led to the strengthening of the detachments at Chahbar (31 to 108) and Jask ( 104 men and 2 British officers to 206 men and do. ); while, directly owing to the war, a considerable force has had to be despatched to Seistan. Bushire has already been disposed of. The forces at the latr.er place, and at Chahbar, Jask and Muscat, are likely to remain immobile. The Seistan force is intended to be highly mobile. It seems desirable to get all these forces on to the footing of your course (3). Could we not argue generally that in a war extending to three continents which has called up all the Military reserves of every part of the Empire, the presumption must be that any Indian troops engaged in bperations beyond the external frontiers of India, or garrisoned in regions where such operations are in progress, come under the Resolutions? (Sd.) A.Hirtzel. 29.11.15. Secretary, Political Dept. Please see the attached draft letter to the Treasury. Do you concur? I should be obliged if the statements of strength of troops can be verified. (Sd.) W.Robinson. 10.12.15. Secretary, Financial Dept. I have verified the figures referred to, and suggest some alterations in pencil for the sake of greater accuracy. InIn the earlier part of para.2 I would suggest the insertion of 'normally' or some similar qualifying word at the place indicated. It was certainly the general practice to divide the cost of troops employed in Persia otherv/ise than in connection with the arms traffic; but I am not clear that India did not bear the whole cost in certain cases, e.g. when troops have been provided (as were the original detachments at Jask and Chahbar) to guard telegraph stations^. Subject to these remarks, I concur in the draft. (Sd.) A.Hirtzel.F. 5722/15. * Dated 27th October 1915, INDIA OFFICE. WHITEHALL, S.W., 20th January 1916.

The effect from this point of view of the alteration of system would depend on the realised proportion of “ordinary” to “extraordinary” expenditure, the latter increasing with the expensiveness of the operations in which the troops are engaged. The troops at Bush ire (one battalion of infantry and details), for example, and those at Chahbar (about 100 strong), Task (about 200 strong), and Muscat (about 760 strong), are, and are likely to remain immobile, so that the extraordinary expenditure on them will probably be small, whereas the troops in Seistan (about 600 infantry and 350 cavalry) are intended to be highly mobile. Mr. Chamberlain is of opinion, however, that a division of the charges in accordance with the Resolution of 26th November 1914, is appropriate in itself. This method of division has nowbeen applied to the Indian troops operating in France, Egypt, GallipoliT^East Africa, a^d—the CarnCToen-s-; to the additional Indian regiment sent since the commencement of the war to Mauritius ; and to the large body of regular British troops sent to Europe from India in exchange for Territorials.

It appears to us that the evidence of German intentions to concentrate on Seistan in winter may refer rather to what was their original plan than to what they can actually accomplish in view of the presence of our troops in Seistan and Birjand. When the troops now en route arrive we shall have 350 sabres, 600 rifles, with six machine guns, distributed possibly one squadron, one double company, two machine guns, each on Birjand, Seistan, and Kacha, and should Germany really seem likely to concentrate on Seistan, the B^rjand detachment could move to Seistan. But we regard Baghdad as the key to the situation in Persia, and we believe rumours and information as to German intentions in that country to be spread deliberately by Germans with the idea of distracting our attention from Baghdad and causing us to disseminate our forces.Force D.” 16.

Bush ire garrison has been raised recently to full Indian Infantry Regiment and included in Force “ I),,” and another regiment has been despatched there recently in addition. But for inclusion of force in Force “D” entire charge(s) of additional garrison would have been apparently divisible in moieties between Imperial Government and Government of India. See your telegram dated 2 1 st November 1912 regarding troops in Persia. As however garrison is now included in Force “D,” we presume that Indian revenues will have to bear ordinary cost of entire garrison which would have fallen on them but for war, namely ( 1 ) full ordinary cost under foreign service conditions in Persia of original garrison of 56, rank and file ; (2) half of total ordinary cost under foreign service conditions in Persia of 244 officers and men specially added in 1911 to 1913; (3) ordinary cost under peace conditions of rest of garrison. 17.

Persian and Oman Operations. 1 . Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 27th October 1915. In connection with European War we have sent additional troops to Muscat and to various parts of Persia not included within sphere of the operation of Force “ D.’’ Expenses of these troops have been hitherto met from Indian revenues, but our Oomptroller-Oeneral doubts whether this arrange ment is permissible in view of provision of Section 22 of new Government of India Act. Having regard to view recently taken by you in connection with incidence of charges of regulars transferred to Home establishment, we think that incidence of cost of above-mentioned troops should be governed by Houses of Parliament Resolutions of 26th November last? Usual arrangement in case of Persia in recent years has been that entire expendi ture on Indian troops employed in connection with local disturbances and apart from arms traffic operations has been shared in moieties between Imperial Government and Government of India (see your telegram dated 21st November 1912 regarding troops in Persia). It would seem, however that this arrangement, which is in accordance with the AVelby Commission’s recommendations, and which would be more favourable to India than that now proposed by us, has been superseded for the period of war by resolution cited above. We should be glad to receive early instructions in the matter. Sir, E. 5722/15. 2 . India Office to Treasury. India Office, 20th January 1916.

The Secretary, Treasury. I am, &amp;c., T. W. Holderness. 3. Treasury to India Office. No. 6128. Treasury Chambers, 14th March 1916. I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury your letter of the 20th January last (F. 5722/15) regarding the incidence of cost of troops from the Indian establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the war. I am to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, copy of correspondence between this Department and the War Office on the subject; and I am to express the hope that Mr. Secretary Chamberlain will accede to the suggestion of the Army Council that the Government of India should bear the whole charges of these troops for the time being, until the question of the ultimate incidence of the expenditure can be dealt with. If, however, the Secretary of State feels unable to accept this proposal, My Lords are of opinion that, as an alternative, the same basis should be adopted for dealing with troops in Persia as has been suggested in the case of Aden by Treasury letter of the 17th ultimo (507/16), the whole cost of troops in Oman remaining as a charge upon Indian Funds. I am, &amp;c.. The Under Secretary of State Robert Chalmers. for India. Enclosure 1 in above. Treasury to War Office. No. 1909. Treasury Chambers, Sir, 19th February 1916. I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to request you to invite the attention of the Army Council to a letter dated the 20th ultimo which they have received from the India Office and of which they understand a copy has been sent to your Department, respecting the incidence of the cost of troops from the Indian establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the war. # My Lords would be glad to learn the views of the Army Council upon the proposal of the Secretary of State for India in Council, seeing that Army Funds wdll presumably bear any charge accepted by the Imperial Exchequer. My Lords would have thought that, the interest of India in Persia and Oman being substantial, it would have been reasonable that a larger proportion of the extraordinary expenses should fall upon Indian revenues than falls in the case of Indian troops serving in Flanders or Gallipoli, e.g-, a proposal that India should bear the ordinary charges of Indian troops in3 Persia half the extraordina^ charges would have marked the special character of the Indian interest. Moreover, as India paid the whole cost of Indian troops m Oman before the war, it might be held that there is no reason why any less proportion should be paid after the war. The Council are aware that the extra cost of certain Indian troops which weie sent to lersia early in 1907 was divided in equal moieties between Indian and Imperial bunds {vide correspondence ending with the letter from this Department of the 12th April 1908, 7096/08), but their Lordships’ predecessors agreed on a subsequent occasion to accept as a charge upon Imperial Funds a moiety of the whole cost of Indian troops employed in Southern Persia in 1911 and thereafter. My Louis assume that Aimy funds are not already bearing charges in respect of operations in Persia which should be set against the Indian expenditure. I am, Ac.. The Secretary, War Office. John Bradburv. Enclosure 2 in above. War Office to Treasury. No. 0164/3389 (F. 1.) War Office, Sn\ 4th March 1916. I am commanded by the Army Council to acknowledge receipt of your letter, No. 1909/16 of the 19th ultimo, regarding the incidence of cost of the troops from the Indian Establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the war. The Council agree with Their Lordships that, having regard to the substantial interest of India in Persia and Oman, there is no reason why the Imperial Government should bear the same share of the expenditure as in tiie case of the operations in France, and while the Council are unaware of the grounds on which the Treasury agreed to share equally between Imperial and Indian revenues the whole cost of the Indian troops employed in Southern Persia in 1911 and thereafter, they do not think that those grounds should necessarily determine the incidence of cost under the totally different circumstances now prevailing. The Council consider that the case is one which should be dealt with by the transfer of a round sum based on estimate only, as suggested in the case of Aden in War Office letter 0164/3340 A. (F. 1) of 6 th January 1916, and approved in Treasury letter 507 of 17th February 1916. Holding this view, they consider that efforts should be made to dispense with detailed accounting between the Indian Government and the War Office at a time of pressure like the present; and, as the whole sum involved is not large in proportion to other military expenditure, they consider that the Government of India might reasonably be expected to bear the whole charges of these troops, currently, until such time as the question of the ultimate incidence of the expenditure can be dea Itwith.

Question of revision of Agreement of 1900 with Foreign Office. 1. Extract from letter from India Office to Foreign Office of 19th March 1910 (Pol. 268). In view of the large and increasing adjustments in favour of this Office winch are now necessary m connection with the annual statements of diplomatic and considar expenditure in Persia, the continuance of an annual payment o£ 4,08/L 10 s. from Indian to Imperial Revenues in advance of the adjustment (two years later), based on the actual expenditure of the two Governments, does not appear to be any longer appropriate, and I am to snggest foi 8 u E. Grey s consideration that it should be abandoned. I am, &amp;c., R. Ritchie. 2. Extract from letter from Foreign Office to India Office, dated 3rd May 1910. 2. With reference to the concluding paragraph of your letter, I am to observe that it would, seem most convenient to regard the payment made in any year as the contribution in respect of that year, although the amount is based on the actual expenditure of the last year but one. If, however, it is regarded merely as a settlement of accounts of previous years, 1 am to point out that the sum of 4,087L 10 s. is not a contribution by India solely on account of Persia, 487b 10s., being in fact, the amount paid for that service, as will be seen from the letter from this Office to the Treasury of August 11 th, 1900, which was communicated to you by the Treasury on September 11th, 1900. 3. Moreover, it is not certain that the present excess of expenditure by India will continue ; Turbat-i-Haidari has been reduced, the exchange of Kermanshah and Mohammerah involves less expenditure than before from Indian revenues, and the total Indian expenditure in 1907-8 was largely swollen by arrear charges. There is, again, the prospect of economies in the establishments administered by India as stated in your letter under reply, while the proposal in the letter from this Office, No. 1153 of February 20th, 1909, that certain posts which are at present held by Indian officials should in future be filled from the Levant Consular Service, would further relieve India of providing in the first instance for those establishments. 4. As Lord Morley is aware, the accounts from India have not hitherto been received till long after the expiration of the year to which they relate, and if these are in future rendered at an earlier date a more speedy settle ment will become possible. 5. Under these circumstances it would appear best that any modification of the existing methods of adjusting accounts should be deferred till a general revision of the 1900 arrangement, when it wall be necessary to take into account also the additional expenditure incurred by this Department in China since that date. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, W. Langley. 15583. I. 1145. 20.—2/1914.3. Note by Financial Department, India Office (F. 2137/10). Political Secretary, I attach a draft reply to the Foreign Office. In view of the reference made by the Foreign Office to “a general revision of the 1900 arrangement ” an examination has been made in this Department of the financial effect of this arrangement. It will be seen from the attached notes that owing to various causes India is at present paying a slightly larger sum annually than the Foreign Office in respect of Persia (after taking into account all adjustments made under the terms of the settlement); that she is bearing the larger share of expenditure in Turkish Arabia ; and the whole of the expenditure in respect of Muscat. I think therefore that even if we were called upon to pay something extra in respect of China (and this perhaps would be open to question), we have nothing to fear from a revision of the 1900 arrangement. The detailed statement of expenditure by the Foreign Office in Persia and Siam in 1908-9 has been retained in this Department for reference in connection with the Political Secretary’s reference of 15th April last, Political 563. 13th August 1910. W. Robinson, for Financial Secretary Memoranda accompanying 3. A.— Effect of general revision of Agreement of 1900. The result of a revision of this Agreement would depend on various factors, the most important being presumably :— I. Persia :— As matters stand (owing to causes dealt with in the attached note on Persian expenditure), despite the annual adjustments, India is spending something more on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia than the Foreign Office. . This can be seen from the figures of 1907-08, the last year 111 lespect of which the accounts have been adjusted. The expenditure of the two Governments in respect of that year was as follows :—0 *•* Foreign Office :— x* dj Actual outlay in Persia in 1907-08 - 31/118 Deduct advauce by India Office in 1907-0- - - 487 30,931 Payment to India Office in 1909-10 in respect of Persian expenditure in 1907-08 _ . _ _ 16,818 Total - - 47,749 Excess of expenditure by India over expenditure by Foreign Office - £2,752 II. Turkish x^rabia : — In addition India is bearing the larger part of the Diplomatic and Consular Establishments in Turkish Arabia, which was supposed to have been shared as a consequence of the recommendation of the Welby Com mission {see note on Persian expenditure attached). The average annual outlay by India is about 6,000C, in addition to a special contribution of 1,400L to the Foreign Office in respect of Basra, in the annual subsidy. The Foreign Office spend about 1,500C a year on Basra and give us a small contribution towards Baghdad (half of Mr. Gaskin’s salary.) III. Muscat :— India bears the whole charges, amounting to about 9,000k * Note by Political Department :— Bahrein. Kashgar. Note by Financial Department :— Bahrein : Total expenditure 1908-09, Rs. 56,002 = 3,700Z. Budget, 1910-11, Rs. 55,970 = 3,700Z. (Appendix to India Estimates). Kashgar : Pay of Special Assistant, Rs. 1,850. {Punjab Estimates, Cashmere : Esta blishment and other charges.) IV. China : — As regards China the arrangement from 1834 to 1875 was that India paid one-third of the charges. From 1876-89 India paid a fixed contribution of 15,000k a year. As a result of the Foreign Office Conference in 1891 the contribution was reduced to 12,500k, a rate which was to continue in force till 1899-1900. The Welby Commission considered that the interest of India in the China trade had thus always been officially acknowledged, and that it must be borne in mind that “ India depends for a considerable proportion of her revenue on the opium trade with China. One-third of the divisible charges they stated would amount to about 20 , 000 k a year, but they recommended that the decision of the Foreign Office Conference should be maintained for a period of five or six years, the contribution then to be revised. The payment of 12,500k a year in respect of China was, however, one of those which the Imperial Government agreed to forego in lieu of the contribution of 50,000k a year from them towards the expenses of the India Office, which was recommended by the Welby Commission. At present, therefore, India may be regarded as contributing 42,500k towards expenditure in China. The outlay of the Foreign Office in China in 1910-11 is estimated at 89,500k' ::: ' approximately. In 1900-01 it was 72,200k i; ' If India were to pay in # See figures overleaf. . ^ . j.xj t Should be 18,568Z.; the excess of Indian expenditure m Turkish Arabia is understated above ; the correct figure is 6,816Z., not 6,000Z. {see page 15). 15583. B The total excess outlay falling upon India in respect of Persia, Turkish Arabia, and Muscat, thus amounts to about 17,750kf There may also be Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in connection with some other places outside Persia which is borne entirely by India. The Political Department would be in a position to say whether this is the case.*6 the same proportion as in 1900-01 she would pay 15,500L (72,200Z.: 89 500L : : 12 500Z) or an increase of approximately 3,0001. a year. This would be on the assumption that India has still the same proportionate interest in China as she had in 1900. The recent arrangements which have been made, however, in negotiation with the Chinese Government for the reduction and final cessation of the exports of opium from India to China within seven years from the present date has materially altered the situation so far as the trade in opium is concerned. In the circumstances there does not appear to be any strong ground, if any ground at all, for increasing the present contri bution to the Imperial Government in respect of China.

It would seem, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from a revision of the 1900 Agreement, but on the contrary would have a reasonable claim to additional contributions from the Foreign Office in respect of Persia and Turkish Arabia, and possibly to a contribution in respect of Muscat.

The explanation of this difference is as follows :— II.— Financial effect of Report of Welby Commission. 1. Effect assumed by Commission. —According to the figures before the Welby Commission (Yob II. of Report, pages 403, 404) the Indian expenditure in connection with Persia and Turkish Arabia w r as apparently 8,700/. per annum higher than the Foreign Office expenditure. They recommended a reduction of 5,000k per annum in the subsidy annually paid by the India Office to the Foreign Office. This would have had the effect, if the sum of 8,700/. per annum had correctly represented the excess of Indian over Foreign Office expenditure, of leaving the Indian expenditure less per annum than the Foreign Office expenditure by 1,300/. Or, if a sum of 833/. per annum (page 403) spent by the Foreign Office on the Karum River subsidy be excluded, by 467/. o Cj. Disturbing factors.—As a matter of fact this result was not attained at September 1900 for the following reasons :— (1) The Foreign Office expenditure shown in the documents before the Commission was really 7,000/. a year less than appeared to be the case, as a deduction of this amount should have been made in respect of the India Office subsidy from the gross outlay of the Foreign Office shown on page 403. (2) The outlay by the Government of India in Persia and Turkish Arabia at September 1900 (taking the average of the figures for 1899-1900 and 1900-01 in Government of India’s Foreign Letter, 27th March 1902, No. 56, as the nearest possible approximation to this rate) was 30,037/. ( = Persia 24,416/. and Turkish Arabia 5,621k), instead of the 23,523/. in the table laid before the Commission. Increase 6,514/. (3) The Foreign Office expenditure in Persia at September 1900 was (taking as the nearest possible approximation the average figure for 1899-1900, and 1900-01 given in Annex 3, Enclosure 14, Political Despatch 14, 6 th February 1903, and omitting expenditure on Karun Subsidy) 21,966/., instead of 21,825k m table laid before Commission. Increase 141/. The result of these three factors would be to leave India at September 1900 paying 7 , 000 k+ 6,514k-141/.-467k more than the Foreign Office^ 12,906/.' * Incorrect: see footnote to previous page, t For more accurate figure see page 13. X Incorrect: the figure given on page 13 is 9,568L* 9,568Z .: see Note + on preceding page. 3. Actual result at September 1900.—The actual result as regards September 1900 was as follows :— India paid in Persia and Turkish Arabia - 30,037 (approximately, see above.) The India Office paid the Foreign Office 2,400 32,437 The Foreign Office paid in Persia - 21,966 (approximately, see above.) Deduct receipt from India Office 2,400 Net payments - 19,566 Excess of Indian expenditure - - 12,871 This agrees very closely with the theoretical result worked out above. 4. Disturbing factors between September 1900 and 1907-08.—The causes which led to a reduction of the excess payments by India from 12,871 L at September 1900 to 8,761L‘ :: '' in 1907-08 are somewhat obscure, and are being investigated in the Financial Department. The disturbing factors appear to have come in during the years from 1900 to 1905-06, but they have not been satisfactorily traced. Expenditure at Basra. We pay the Foreign Office 1,400Z. a year in respect of Basra, the contribution of 6,000L a year to the Foreign Office in respect of Persia and the minor Consulates agreed upon in 1900 having included 1,400L in respect of Basra.

Letter from India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Whitehall, S.W., Sir, 8 th September 1910. With reference to the concluding paragraph of Sir R. Ritchie’s letter of 19th March last, and paragraphs 2-5 of your reply of 3rd May, No. 10,693, I am directed to state that the payment made each year to this Office by your Department in respect of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia has always been regarded by this Department (as will be seen on reference to the annual claims) as being the net result of two transactions, viz :— (1) An adjustment in respect of the expenditure by the two Governments in the previous year but one ; and (2) A standing advance of 4,087L 10s. by this Office to the Foreign Office in respect of the current year. It has, of. course, been recognised by this Department that the sum of 4,087Z. 10s. just mentioned is made up of various items, of which only487L 10 s. is in respect of Persia. But in view of the fact that the annual expenditure by India in Persia is now very greatly in excess of the Imperial expenditure the amount of the excess in 1907—8 (the last year in respect of which an adjustment has been made) having been 35,414b—and that no payment m respect of this additional outlay is made to this Office until between one and two years after date, it seemed to the Secretary of State for India in Council inappiopriate that in addition this Department should continue to make a payment in advance ; and although only a part of the advance of 4,087b 10s. is in respect of Persia it seemed not unreasonable, as the various items have hitherto been lumped together, that the whole of the advance should be discontinued. It would, in fact, in Lord Morlev’s opinion, have been reasonable to.go further and to suggest that a standing advance should be made by the Foreign Office to the India Office, but his Lordship did not wish to press this suggestion. It is argued in your letter under reply that the present excess of expenditure by India may not continue, but while this is not denied, it seems likely that the Government of India’s expenditure in Persia will continue to be in excess of that incurred by the Foreign Office for at least some years to come; and in the meantime it seems to be unreasonable to continue a system of advances which have now for some years ceased to be appropriate. Lord Morley ventures to hope therefore that on reconsideration, Sir E. Grey will agree with him that the proposal made by this Office was reasonable and moderate, and that it should be carried into effect. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. (Signed) C. G.

In reply I am to state that My Lords regret that they are unable to assent to this proposal. They agree with the views expressed in the letter from your Department to the India Office of the 3rd May last (10,693/10),and think that the reasons therein given sufficiently justify a refusal to acquiesce in a partial revision of existing arrangements.

Note by Financial Department, dated 8th February 1911 (Political 2891). (N.B .—The appendices referred to below have not been printed for the purposes of this Memorandum.) It is true as stated in our letter of the 25th June 1909, that the cost of the Baghdad Residency was taken into account in making the arrangement of 1900. What has been discovered since that letter was written is that—despite this fact, and despite the intention of the Welby Commission that Diplomatic and Consular expenditure on the Persian Mission and certain minor con sulates (which included Turkish Arabia), should be equally shared between the two Governments—the effect of their actual recommendation (i.e., that the contribution of 7,000L a year previously paid by this Office to the Foreign Office should be reduced to 2,000k a year), was to leave this Office to bear unaided a considerable portion of the total expenditure. The explanation of this paradox is as follows : — ( 1 ) In his answer to questions 12,413-4,* put by the Welby Commission, Sir H. Waterfield submitted a state- t* ip P Pdt -/yt (printed at pages 41.3-4, Vol. 11, or the Report) showing :— I. Average expenditure by Foreign Office on £ Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia in 1893-94, 1894-95, and 1895-96 - - 21,825 II. Average expenditure by India in Persia and Turkish Arabia but including an annual contribution of 7,000k to Foreign Office 30,522 Sir H. Waterfield remarked that as the Foreign Office was receiving 7,000k a year from the India Office their gross expenditure must be reduced by that amount to arrive at their correct outlay. But in reply to a later question (questions 14,986-7)$ Sir H. Waterfield : Appendix 3 to this Note. seems t0 have overlooked the fact that 7,000k a year ought to be deducted from the gross outlay of the Foreign Office to arrive at their net outlay. For he stated that in order to divide expenditure equally between the Foreign Office and the India Office the contribution of 7,000Z. a year should be reduced to about 2,650k The process by which he arrived at this figure was plainly as follows :— £ India Office expenditure (including contribution of 7,000k to Foreign Office) - - 30,522 Foreign Office expenditure (neglecting receipt from India Office) - - - - 21,825 Excess of Indian expenditure - - 8,697 half of this - - - - 4,348 and deducting this sum from 7 , 000 k the remainder is 2,652k11 beend'erW^/f 11 the l’ 00 ° l “'‘'b 1 '* 6 ' 1 b y the India Office had been very different gl '° SS 80 ° ffiCe ° Utlay ’ the reSult lTOuld h ave The calculation would then have been : Indian expenditure - _ _ Foreign Office expenditure (21,825h - 7 , 000 ^- Excess expenditure by India Half this excess - - _ _ £ 30,522 14,825 15,697 i ,848 If the contribution of 7,0001. to the Foreign Office had been reduced b&gt; this sum, it would have been converted into a contribution from the t oreign 0^ffice to India of 84SZ. , ^ ^ urt L l ler corr action necessary to equalise expenditure was the omission tiom the r oreign Office figures of annual expenditure in accordance with the * Appendix 4 to this Xote. recommendations of the Commission , 0007 . , , (paragraph 246 of their Report-) of a sum ot bool, included on account of the Karun River subsidy The Com mission recommended that the Basra-Baghdad subsidy paid by India should be regarded as the equivalent of the Karun subsidy paid by the Foreign r i- ? ir x T ^ aterfield was not, of course, responsible for the omission or this luithei collection. AA ith this correction it will be seen that the expenditure met by India was greater than that met by the Foreign Office by J6,530L (I5,69H., as above + S33L), and that, to equalise matters our contribution of^7,000Z a year to the Foreign Office ought to have, been reduced by £ ^ ~ 8,265Z. (i.e., turned into a contribution by the Foreign Office to ns of 1,265L) As a matter of fact the Rojud Commission recommended! a reduction of our contribution by 5,0001. or 3,265Z. short of what the reduction should have been, and India was thus left to bear alone an annual expenditure of 3,2651.

Further, in the interval between the period covered by the figures given by Sir H.

I agree as to the alterations in the draft letter. A. Hirtzel 9. Note by Financial Department, India Office (Political 4213). Political Secretary, I attach a copy of an unofficial letter jj from this Department to the Treasury and dated 11th January. The matter was subsequently discussed by Mr. Robinson of this Department '* * ' and Mr. Behrens of the Treasury. It was pointed out on behalf of this Office that the proposal which we had made would not involve any alteration in the agreement of 1900 : that we had no wish to be let off the annual payment of 4087£. 10s. (to which that of 6,000Z,'i \ ■ 13 agreed upon in 1900 was subsequently reduced), and that our proposal related only to the time at which the payment of that sum in respect of any given year should be made—our view being that it would now be reasonable and appropriate to make it at the same time as we receive the sums now paid by the foreign Office in respect of that given year. Mr. Behrens said that the Ireasury were entirely opposed to the change suggested. He did not deny that the existing system gives the Treasury the advantage of the interest on 4,087L 10s. continuously. But, he held that the procedure under which the time of payment of this sum is fixed, was decided upon as an outcome of the Agreement of 1900, and that so long as that Agreement remains in force the Treasury are entitled to any benefit which the procedure may give them. In view of the attitude taken up by the Treasury, there does* not appear to be any use in pursuing the subject further at present, and the matter must, I think, now be dropped. Hoes the Political Secretary concur? F, W. Newmauch. 9th February 1911. v [i &gt; i ► Copy of Unofficial Letter to Mr. Wilkins of the Treasury. India Office, Whitehall, S.W., Hear Wilkins, 11th January 1911. You may remember that in 1904 you and Abrahams arranged the procedure to be adopted in adjusting the payments by this Office to the Foreign Office in respect of Hiplomatic and Consular expenditure in con nection with Persia and various minor consulates. The procedure is set forth in Treasury letter to the Foreign Office of 16th January 1904, No. 19,089/03 (Annex to Enclosure 2 of Political Despatch No. 75, dated 29th July 1904, of which a copy is attached), and in subsequent letters, and is as follows :— In any given year (say A), India is to pay to the Foreign Office 4,0871 10s. in respect of that year (-— 6 , 0001 , less a permanent reduction of 1,9121 10s. for which see India Office letter of 27th July 1904, Enclosure 8 , to the above-mentioned Despatch), plus or minus an adjustment in respect of the financial year but one before the given year (say B), the plus portion consisting of half of any net increase in the Foreign Office expenditure in year (B), as compared with September 1900, and the minus portion consisting of half any net increases in Indian expenditure in year (B), as compared with that at September 1900. The transactions therefore fall into two parts, viz. :—(1) a payment in respect of the given year (A), and (2) an adjustment in respect of the earlier year (B). At the time when this arrangement was made, the adjustment in respect of year (B), though consisting of a refund to this Office, was smaller than the payment to the Foreign Office in respect of year (A). For some years, however, the situation has been completely changed, the amount of the refund being far in excess of the payment in respect of year A. For example, in 1907-08 we paid the Foreign Office 4,0871 10s. in respect of that year (receiving at the same time a refund of 7,4701 16s. from them in respect of the year 1905-06), whilst in 1909-10 we received a refund of 16,8181 Ss. 8 cl in respect of the year J 907-08 (paying at the same time 4,0871 10s. in respect of 1909-10. It seems to us that the procedure of making a fixed payment of 4,0871 10s. to the Foreign Office in respect of a given year, though originally quite appropriate, is no longer so, now that a very much larger payment is really due from the Foreign Office to us. These views were set forth in letters to the Foreign Office dated 19th March and 8 th September last, of which I attach copies, but have met with an un favourable reception from them and you (see your letter to the Foreign Office dated 2 nd November 1910, No. 17037/10 (39,976)). 1 think there must be some misconception as to what it is we are asking and why ; and, as you were concerned in the drafting of the original arrangement, I am writing to you unofficially in the hope that you may take the view that our request is a reasonable one, and that, if we renew it, it may be agreed to. 15583. Dmam _ 14 It is apparently thought that we are asking for a modification of the agree ment of 1900, but this is not so. We do not wish to escape the liability of the 4 , 0 S 7 L 10 s., but we think that it would be convenient and appropriate that the payment from the India Office to the Foreign Office in respect of any given year (Part (1) of your arrangement) should be made at the same time as the payment by the Foreign Office to the India Office in respect of that year (Part (2) of your arrangement), i.e., in the next year but one after the comple tion of the given year. Don’t you think our proposal reasonable ? As matters stand our expenses in Persia are at present between 30,000L and 40,000?. a year greater than those of the Foreign Office and, though this discrepancy is about to be largely reduced owing to reductions and transfers, yet our expenditure in future is certain still to exceed that of the Foreign Office, but the refund by the Foreign Office to us in respect of that excess of expenditure will continue to be made if matters go on as they are between one and two years afterwards; and it seems unreasonable that w^e should be required to make our payment of 4,087?. lOs. at an earlier date than the Foreign Office refund to us is made. The immediate effect of compliance with our request would be that our payments of 4,087?. 10s. in respect of the years 1910-11 and 1911-12, which would under present arrangements be made in those years, would be post poned in each case for two years, with the result that the Foreign Office payments to us in those years would be correspondingly increased, but the net final result of the transactions would of course be unaffected. I hope I have made my point clear ? Yours sincerely, W. Robinson. 10. Minute by Political Department, India Office, dated 11th February 1911 (Political 4213). At the instance of the Financial Department, the question was raised of the propriety of making the Foreign Office an annual advance of 4,087?. 10 , 5 . two years before the money is rightly due in connection with the adjustment of the accounts of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia. The Treasury have expressed themselves unwilling to accept our view, on the ground that the arrangement was the outcome of an Agreement of 1900, which is still in force. On the reference paper below,-the Financial Department advise that there does not appear to be any use in pursuing the subject further at present. Submission. It is submitted that in accordance with the view of the Financial Department the question of the propriety of making to the Foreign Office the annual advance of 4,087?. 10s. be for the present dropped.

As regards the incidence of expenditure at Bagdad (vide ante-penulti mate paragraph of Sir Charles Hardinge’s letter above quoted, I am to inclose a Memorandum from which it will be seen that, despite the intention of the Agreement of 1900, the effect of that Instrument has been to throw on Indian revenues in respect of Persia and Turkish Arabia an excess charge which more than covers the expenditure on the Bagdad Residency.

In addition, it includes some papers relating to expenditure on diplomatic and consular establishments in Turkish Arabia, Muscat and China, as well as Persia.The file includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Levant Consular Service</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Consuls</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Treasury</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Turkish Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>China</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomats</topic></subject><subject><topic>Embassies and consulates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Government spending</topic></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Persian Agreement (1919)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000209#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
