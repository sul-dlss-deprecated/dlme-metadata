The report gives details of the history of the Jam of Beylah and his antecedents explaining his opposition to the Khan; the recent movements of them against the Khan and their attempts to recruit other Sirdar's to join them.

The letter also includes a note regarding a report that Ibrahim Khan, who had been causing the difficulties at Kedj had died, but that this was not as yet confirmed as reliable information. Also contained within the report is information on the various tribes in Khelat and Afghanistan, giving details of the areas they occupy, the names of their leaders, details of arrangements they may have for providing safe passage through passes and other trade routes, and information regarding how the Khan has handled those Sirdar's seeking forgiveness who wished to re-align themselves with him.The report concludes by bringing to the attention of Government the work of Doctor R Bowman who had been serving as a Surgeon and Oculist in Quettah [Quetta] and supporting the Government's proposal to increase his pay.Letter No.55 of 1869 from Captain Charles Henry Harrison, 24 December 1869 informing Colonel Phayre that the conclusions arrived at in paragraph eleven of his report (No.54 of 1869) were based on personal knowledge of the individuals concerned and stating that his report was intended to demonstrate the Jam of Beyla's intention to upset the Khan's Government.
