J I HAVE the honour to report that His Highness Abdul Hussein Farman- Farmayan, G.C.M.G., better known by his former title of Farman Farma, died in Tehran on the 22nd November. 2 On the death of the Farman Farma’s son, Prince Firuz, which was &lt;7 reported in my despatch No. 13 of the 15th January, 1938, no public announcement 30 'whatever was allowed to appear. Prince Firuz had long been under a cloud, and his death was allowed to transpire by way of rumour, inevitably accompanied by hints of foul play. The age of the Farman Farma (over 80), and the fact that he spent his latter years in free and quiet residence in Tehran, in undisturbed enioyment of his astonishing powers of procreation, have disposed ot any sue suggestion in his case. Nevertheless, the fact that he was the most eminent surviving Qaiar prince (please see No. 77 in personalities), and that he was a well- known public figure of an age that is now officially disparaged, caused the 1 Resi dent of the Mailis, M. Hassan Esfandiary, who is connected with him by marriage to make enquiries of the Shah when it was seen that the old man was ailing and likely to die. Evidently the answer was reassuring, for the death and the holding of two memorial services, one in a mosque and the other at the deceased s residence, have been announced in the press over M. Hassan Esfandiary s signature &amp; 3 i n view of the Farman Farma’s close association with British authorities in the past, and since he held the honour of Knight Grand Cross of the Oidei of St Michael and St. George, I sent my condolences, and the senior Iranian member of the legation staff attended one of the memorial services. 4 The death of the Farman Farma severs a most outstanding link with the period of the Qaiar dynasty, and in particular with that of British intervention in South Persia at the time of the war of 1914—18. Since the establishment o the Pahlavi regime he has lived in retirement, but not in oblivion; for the family life of this remarkable old man has never ceased to be a subject of reverent comment Until almost the end of his days he was mating and breeding, and though the birth-rate in the later stages fell to less than three per annum, the Copy No. 112 ao-ed^father yielded to none in the assiduous care with which he kept track of all hi s numerous progeny, and it is a fact that he has been known, when an acquaint ance made reference to one of the younger ones, to bring out a well-thumbed, little pocket-book in which particulars were entered, and turn up the lekwant page. He is the type of the Persian grandee that was once common, but under modern conditions is fast disappearing. 1 ^ ^ ^ 5 Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and His Majesty’s consular officers at Ahwaz.

Seymour to Viscount Halifasc.—{Received November 14.) (No. 345.) My Lord, Tehran, October 31, 1939. AS reported in my telegram No. 165 of the 28th October, it was announced. after the meeting of the new Majliss on the 26th October that M. Jam, the Prime Minister, had been appointed Minister of the Court, and was to be succeeded by Dr. Matin Daftary, the Minister of Justice. It has since been announced that M. Bader, the Minister of Finance, has been replaced by General Amir Khosrovi, the president of the National Bank. No statement has been made as regards any future employment for M. Bader, who disappears from the Government. The remaining Ministers are, I am informed, to continue in their present posts. 2. The main interest of this reshuffle is thus the elimination of M. Bader, who has generally been regarded as the most pro-German element in the late Cabinet. As I have previously reported, it has been clear in recent months that a struggle for the control of financial policy w^as proceeding between M. Bader and General Amir Khosrovi. This has now 7 resulted in victory for the General, who will find himself in control of the country’s finances at a singularly difficult moment. There is reason to believe that his first activity will be a purge of those elements of the Ministry of Finance who are most closely connected with M. Bader’s policy. The financial abilities of General Amir Khosrovi remain to be proved. He has certainly acquired some knowledge of banking during the last few years, but has always struck me as having rather optimistic ideas of the expenditure which this country can afford. Direct experience of the Ministry of Finance may, how 7 ever, engender a more cautious attitude. 3. 'The selection of Dr. Matin Daftary for the post of Prime Minister has caused surprise. He is one of the youngest of the C abinet Ministers, and, while he has been quite an effective Minister of Justice, he is a man of the official or civil service type, rather than one of any popular appeal. But so long as he can accurately carry out the orders of the Shah the personality of the Prime Minister is of no great importance at present. 4 . The appointment of M. Jam as Minister of the Court fills a post which has been vacant since the fall of Teymourtache. The Minister -of the Court ranks next to the Prime Minister, but does not attend Cabinet Councils. M. Jam has expressed to me great pleasure at his new appointment, which is likely, in his case, to be of honour rather than of great influence. I think, however, that such influence as he may be able to exercise at Court wdll be in the right direction. 5 The Ministry of Justice wall mwv be in the hands of the present Under secretary, M. Mohammed Sorouri, as Acting Minister, and General Amir Khosrovi is succeeded at the National Bank by M. Mohammed Ali Farzin. 6 .

In my despatch No. 300 of the 31st August last I had the honour to report that Monsieur Abul Qasim Ferouhar had been appointed to this post. No announcement regarding Monsieur Ferouhar’s removal from office has as yet been made. 2. Monsieur Hikmat* an account of whose career will be found under No. 99 in my 1938 personalities Report* was Minister of Education until his sudden and unexpected dismissal reported in Mr. Butler’s telegram No. 88 of the 15th July last. His record in the Ministry of Education was a good one, and his return to favour is encouraging* 3. I happened to meet Monsieur Hikmat yesterday and took the opportunity of congratulating him and asking how he expected to like his new duties. Monsieur Hikmat said that education was his real bent and that no other work could be so satisfactory to him. He hoped, however, to find a useful sphere of activity in the department of public health, of which, as Minister of the Interior, he is the head. Monsieur Hikmat’g work at the Ministry of iiducation has shown that he has considerable energy and driving power, and if he is given a chance he should be able to accomplish valuable work in his new Ministry. , In the domain of public health he will at any rate, except in the large towns, be starting more or less from scratc / 4 , The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., z'' - N etc ., etc. , etc.,t rs (259/2/39) Uy Lord, V 1833 10th February, 1939. 1939 I — i ubiii— nmwi n in 11 I have the honour to report that Monsieur All soheily, formerly Iranian Minister in London, who was dismissed from the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs in July last, has been appointed Govern or-General of Kerman. Installs of his career will be found under No. 200 in my 1933 Personalities Report. 2. In view of the important posts which he has held in the past, Monsieur Schelly*o appointment to the Governorship of the impoverished province of Kerman indicates that he has not yet returned to full favour with the Shah. He has however very small private resources and will, I have no doubt, be glad to put his foot onto the official ladder again. 3. Of other Ministers who fell into disfavour last year it may be worth mentioning that Monsieur Hlfcaat, who was well known to Hie Majesty’s Legation during his tenure of the post of Minister of education, has I hear returned to Tehran and there are reports that he may be re-employed before long. Monsieur Hussein Ala, who will be well remembered as an active representative of the Iranian Government in London, still remains under a cloud.

[E 5351/20/34] Copy No. (No. 340.) Sir, Mr. Seymour to Mr. Edeii.—(Received September 13.) Tehran, August 28, 1987. OPINION in Tehran is now going through a period of some apprehension as to the prospects of the next few months. Anxiety is expressed for various reasons, but the underlying causes of existing and anticipated difficulties are mainly financial. *2. There can be no doubt that the financial situation is becoming more and more difficult, and signs of this are seen in the continual trouble which foreign experts are experiencing in securing payment of the foreign currency due to them under their contracts. No recent attempt has been made to repeat the demand made on the railway contractors to deposit foreign exchange to cover their rial loans, but I learn that the company undertaking the port works on the Caspian has been asked to cover their loans in this way. It is generally believed that the present position of the clearing with Germany shows a large debt from Iran to Germany (estimated at well over XT million), and the volume of imports from Germany has for the moment been reduced to very small proportions. On the other hand, I learn that the debt of the National Bank to the Imperial Bank of Iran has been reduced, though this reduction may only be temporary. A further feature which should be of advantage to the Iranian Government is the rise in the value of agricultural and other such products, but it appears doubtful whether the additional quantity of foreign exchange which should result from these increased values will be sufficient to make very much difference. 3. Another prospective burden on Iranian finance is the possibility, or even probability, of further railway construction. I am informed that the Iranian Government have been making enquiries in Europe with a view to undertaking the construction of the Tabriz Railway. This, it is reported, will cost about XT2 million, and I am informed on authority which should be good that a scheme for using the oil royalties as security for this expenditure has been mooted. It remains to be seen whether the country will he able to bear the further X12 million for railway construction on the top of the cost of equipping and maintaining the Trans-Iranian Railway, in addition to expenditure for military purposes, in which there is no discrimination. 4. The pledging of the oil royalties, if this is really under consideration, must adversely affect Iranian credit, at any rate for some time. Those who have done business with Iran on a large scale have felt that as a last resort there would be the oil royalties in the background. 5. In many parts of the country there is a good deal of nervousness about the food situation. Last winter the operations of the grain monopoly were not entirely well advised, and produced a shortage in East Iran at a time when the exceptionally heavy snow made it difficult to procure supplies from other parts of the country. This year the necessity for finding foreign exchange has again led to considerable exports while over a large area of the country lack of rain has led to short crops. The rice crop is also likely to be short, partly owing to artificial restriction of the area under this crop, partly owing to a poor season, and the price is already rising. Transport is also expected to present a serious problem ; the motor monopoly has been badly managed and the supply of lorries is insufficient to meet the increasing demands upon it. There has recently been some improvement, but much headway has to he made up before the transport system can inspire confidence. The mistakes made last year have naturally caused some uneasiness as to the prospects for the next winter, as many fear that exports have been so great as to reduce the available stocks to a dangerously low level. In the absence, however, of reliable statistics it is not possible to form an accurate view of the position. It does, however, seem [114 n—1]I* rv 2 probable that next winter will be a difficult one and that the ingenuity of the Government will be considerably taxed in meeting the problems of finance and supply which will have to be faced. The forebodings which J have summarised in the preceding paragraphs have, there is no doubt, increased the unpopularity of the present regime, but it is almost impossible under present conditions to /-% imagine any effective opposition or even criticism of the Government policy. ^ If bad times come they will have to be borne, but there is, no doubt, a large volume of opinion which holds that the burden which is being placed on the country is becoming almost intolerable. 1 have, &amp;c.

[E 4759/904/34] Copy No. g g Mr. Seymour to Mr, Eden.—(Received August 16.) (No. 296.) Sir, Tehran, July 31, 1937. I HAVE the honour to inform you that General Amanullah Jehanbani (“ Personalities in Iran,” No. 102) has been dismissed from his post of head of the Department of Industry and Mines. It is not known for certain why he has again fallen from favour. But the rumour which has found most favour in Tehran is that he incurred the Shah’s displeasure by approaching him, at the request of the French Minister, in connexion with some matter affecting the officers of the French military mission. An officer of the mission has, however, told me that there is no truth in this report. General Jehanbani is a Kajar and an officer of some distinction. It is not the first time that he has fallen from favour. 2. His place at the Department of Industry and Mines has been taken by M. Moussa Noury Fsfandiary (“ Personalities in Iran,” No. 75). The whole of M. Noury Esfandiary’s career has been passed in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs or the Diplomatic Service. He does not appear to be a man of any great ability or forcefulness, and his appointment to this important post is surprising. 3. I was recently told by the Prime Minister, who has hitherto retained his former post of Minister of the Interior, that M. Abolghassem Ferouhar (“ Personalities in Iran,” No. 83) has been selected for the post of Acting Minister of the Interior. M. Ferouhar’s recent career affords an excellent example of the changes and chances of the life of an official in this country. A year ago he went from being Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Finance to be Iranian Minister in Paris. He was recalled in January owing to the appearance in the French press of articles objectionable to the Shah, and on his return he was for a short time imprisoned. Subsequently, he was appointed legal adviser to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, from which comparatively unimportant post he is apparently to become a member of the Cabinet. 4 .

Sir, Tehran, February 'll. 1937. 1 HAD the honour to report by telegram the death of Ali Akbar Davar, the Minister of Finance. This completely unexpected event must make a dift'erence to the working of the machinery of the Iranian Government, and may well have far-reaching repercussions on future policy. 1 therefore submit the following remarks on the late Minister and on the financial and commercial complications which his disappearance is likely to cause. 2 . There is no need for me to repeat the record of M. Davar’s services, which are already well known to your Department. He was no doubt personally known to some members of the foreign Office staff, as he was the principal Persian representative at the League of Nations enquiry into the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute early in 1933. His outstanding characteristic was, perhaps, his immense energy. Since 1927 he has been continuously at work, first as Minister of Justice in remodelling and reorganising that Ministry from top to bottom; then as Minister of Finance from September 1933. It was a very rare thing to see him at any reception or ceremony. He seemed to revel in his work, and surprised all his colleagues by his constant application and zeal. Latterly, it was commonly reported in Tehran that he could work in his office till late at night and then bring home more work to finish before the morning; during the night he could think of some detail which had been overlooked and would get up and finish it at once. A man of no recreations, his one diversion was playing with his small children. His achievements in financing recent enormous expenditure on the railway, on the army, and on many other public works are well known. He seemed almost the only member of the Govern ment who could, and would, give a definite reply to a question, and he usually did so at once. In late years hardly any members of my staff have had occasion to deal with him direct; but the oriental secretary remembers two occasions on which he went to talk to him, and on each occasion Davar talked frankly and openly; one was in connexion with the case of the imprisonment of Mr. Parsons, when Davar at once acknowledged that there was very little evidence against the prisoner; the other was connected with the gold surcharge on customs duties; in that case Davar said at once that it was no use our arguing about that as he had made up his mind that this surcharge was going to be levied and nothing we said would make any difference. 3. The Tehran representative of the Anglo-lranian Oil Company, the chief managers of the Imperial Bank of Iran and of the Kampsax consortium, were equally impressed by Davar s ability as well as by his openness and by the honesty with which he fulfilled all his promises. It was he, in fact, who alone was capable of keeping the elaborate financial machine working, whereby huge expenditure for unremunerative purposes such as a railway and an army, was found without recourse to any foreign loan. 4. Stories differ as to the details of his death, ft seems certain that he was at work till a late hour on the 9th February, and that during that day he had been reporting to the Shah, who had spoken to him sharply about funds which would be necessary in the future. He reached his home late at night, and was found in a dying condition in the morning, having taken large doses of opium. The official version remains that he died of heart failure. The Prime Minister broke the news to the Shah, who seemed staggered by the news. The Corps diplomatique attended his funeral at the Sipah Salar College (formerly the mosque) on Friday, the 11 th February. 5. In spite of Davar s recognised ability, honesty and industry, there can be little doubt that his death was greeted with a sigh of relief by the majority of the population. He was regarded by the people as a whole as the author of [965 p—3]crushing taxation, both direct and indirect, which bore heavily on the poorer classes. By the trading community he was considered to be mainly responsible for the hated monopolies and exchange control policy. How far he was actually responsible for these policies, and how far he was making the best of a situation created by the Shah, is a matter for the historian to decide. 6 . When he assumed office as Minister of Finance in 1933, the financial situation of Iran was better than it had been for some years, thanks largely to his own successful efforts to exact from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the highest possible financial contribution. During his four years of office, the national budget rose from 500 million rials to 1,000 million rials. He claimed that all his budgets were balanced, but produced no figures to substantiate his claim. The note circulation increased in the same period from 235 million rials to 800 million rials, a figure which would probably be surpassed shortly if the Shah had not, in the last few days, given orders that this was to be limited. It has been apparent for some time that internal developments were being financed to a large extent by the printing press. His reserves of foreign exchange were depleted in 1934 by the purchase of gold to a value of about £3,500,000, and this gold has been immobilised by being made to act in the double capacity of reserve against the note issue, and capital of the Banque Mellie. Davar may have attempted to restrain the spending enthusiasm of the army, but he was not successful, as one-third of the country's revenue, as well as practically the whole of ihe oil royalties was annually taken for military purposes. Meanwhile, the present year is understood to be the peak year for expenditure on the railway, and considerable sums have been expended on bridges and harbours, grain silos, factories. &amp;c., not all of it wisely spent. The provision of rolling-stock for the railway will be a difficult problem. 7. It has long been evident that expenditure was running far ahead of income, and that sooner or later the fact would have to be faced and the bill met. In his report on economic conditions in Iran dated July 1935, the commercial secretary to this Legation expressed the opinion that “it is certain that every possible expedient will be resorted to in order to avoid recourse to foreign loan.' It would not be exaggerated to say that the recent financial policy of Iran has consisted of one expedient after another, in spite of which the situation has steadily deteriorated. For instance, the importation of German goods under the clearing agreement has been excessive, and I have reason to believe that the balance against Iran is now probably in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000. Recourse to a loan has so far been avoided, but monopoly companies have contracted credits on the strength of their connexion with the State. Among other expedients may also be mentioned the attempt to force construction companies to deposit foreign exchange against rial advances obtained from local banks; insurance legislation with the object of reducing the outflow of exchange in the form of insurance premiums; income tax legislation to tax foreign incomes of residents in Iran; and ever-increasing delays in the provision of foreign exchange to importers. A stage has now been reached when the custom-houses are overflowing with goods which cannot be released as no foreign exchange is available to pay for them; the result on the customs revenue, one of the main items in the national budget, is likely to be considerable. 8 . Davar himself probably realised that an alternative between drastic reduction of expenditure and the contracting of a foreign loan would be almost impossible to find. He is believed to have attempted to effect economies, but so many projects such as the completion of the railway and the ample equipment of the military forces, were insisted on by the Shah, that little or no curtailment of expenditure was possible. During his four years of office Davar built up around the Ministry of Finance and its affiliated Government banks, a structure of monopolies and controlled companies so extensive that the Ministry was attempting, with entirely inadequate organisation and resources, to manage a very large part of the country’s economic and commercial activities. Before the Ministry, and the finances of the country, can be restored to more normal conditions, it may be necessary either to jettison most of these accretions or to remove them from the control of the Ministry of Finance. 9. M. Davar's successor is thus faced with a thankless and difficult task, probably a hopeless one if the intention is to maintain the present policy; to keep the monopolies in being and to avoid a foreign loan. The cause of the present trouble is easy to diagnose : the Johah is spending more than his income. It is3 not likely that income can be increased, but can expenditure be reduced? The two main items of expenditure are the railway and the army. The railway must obviously be finished and (somehow) equipped with rolling-stock. Thereafter (say in two years time) there might be a considerable reduction here unless the construction of the Tabriz railway is begun. On the army there can, in my view, A be no great reduction; the Shah has, in his army, called into being a powerful servant and that servant may well prove sufficiently powerful to insist on being properly maintained. It seems doubtful therefore whether it will be possible voluntarily to reduce expenditure until the railway is finished. The expedient of a foreign loan remains, though this will clearly only be a last resort. A loan of £5 million would, I am credibly informed, probably suffice to put matters straight at present; but a loan would only postpone the day of reckoning so long as the Iranian Government succumb to the attractive habit of spending more than they receive. For the moment the Government is desperately hard-pressed for money. Which way out of their difficulties they are likely to seek is not known; they probably do not know themselves. But a decision can hardly be long deferred. 10 .

It is also rumoured that budget, which late Minister of Finance would have presented next month, shows considerable deficit.

Others attributed it to the 8$ parent immobility of the diplo matic position at Bagdad,*&gt;d there were other stories. ‘fhese were interrupted by a scene between our Dean, the Afghan Ambassador,and a member of the Persian protocol,the former maintaining with his usual fire that It was an Insult to the Diplomatic body to keep them standing in the garden, no we were marched up into the Waiting Chamber,and then down again and up into the £alle des Brillants in whioh the Salaam is held.

He sjoke to few and only to the Turk is i Ambassador with any animation. Apart from the usual congratulations X ventured to express to him His Majesty's grateful recognition of the personal sympathy that Kie on the occasion of his father’s death. Imperial majesty had recently cisplayed/ hater in the day,the h^ad of the Totoool seema to have been sent with a reproving message to the frail,invalid but char ging tTapanese Minister who had not managed his message,handshaking and introduotior s to ths Shah's satisfaction* 6. The Diplomatic Corps dispersed,ths heads of ths Hisslona to sign their names later in the day.wlth their wives, in the ^ueen's book at the thah's new palace and most of them,but not myself,to collect again in the eve lag at the Iraqi Minister's national Day reception when if* haaemi's dismissal,and ths Doyen's gaffs,served as bases for discussion. 7. Three different reasons are given to accou t for the former;two have already he'id mentioned* Rither of these would be adequate. The date rather favours the scandals theory for M* Kaaemi'o departure a month later would have been in accordance with several forecasts,but In spite of rumours to the contrary,he is still a free man. The ministry for foreign Affairs insist that the scandals have nothing to do with it,and that in 2 or 3 months' time M* Kaxsal may be employed in some capacity at home or abroad. The well-informed counsellor at the Iraqi Legation / •r.aitecredit® the 3aghda&lt;i negotiations taeory. Monsieur Kaseni eaa dismissed from the Ministry of Hoads because he was dilatory over the dish's trans-ivlourz road to his property at Ch&amp;lus* tow he has again been found not the aan to get things done. 3. The third theory is that the columns of descrip tion devoted by the newspapers last month to Monsieur Kasemi’s visit to Ajhaulstan ana India, which represented him almost as a ttoyal personage, gave serious offence, and that the &amp;hah was glad to find a reason to dismiss him. either of the other theories could have sews supplied the reason, and it is also rumoured that Monsieur KsRemi's failure to send instructions as to how discontent in the Persian colony at Kerbela over the unveiling, should be u« alt with, reached the Imperial ears* Monsieur Kaseml has made many enemies. I believe that these, and his negative contribution to the negotiations at iiaghdad, account for his fall. Time, if it brings him re-employment or ImprlsonO ment, will throw further light. Meanwhile he is gone and Monsieur damyi, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, assis ted by Monsieur Soneily and Forouhar, received the Heads of Missions this morning. He received them in pairs which effectually prevented the discussion of business. I syn chronised with the Chargf d’affaires of aeltium, in which country Monsieur samyi spent twelve years. His Excellency was rather inarticulately genial; only commonplaces were discussed, but it struct my Belgian colleague and myself that Monsieur samyl had been impressed by his period as Persian Minister In Berlin. Monsieur Samyi comes from an important and even ublquitoua family in Gilan,Wis cousin is the prudent and unambitious Master of the Imperial Court.

It is now clear that Uonsieur veroughi* s resign ation was not voluntary, although he has for some months past been suffering from heart attacks and there Is no doubt that in ordinary clroumstances he would have been glad to be relieved of th* burden of office and to return to his library. The United States' Minister on the very day of His Excellency*s dismissal had received an acceptance from him of an invitation to din© a fortni#iit later but on December 4th a telephone message wae received to the effect that he would not now be abl$ to attend.

This company has apparently been formed, and an announcement was published in the Setareh-ye-Jehan of the 12th July, to the effect that the company will buy wheat at fixed prices varying according to locality and quality of the wheat. 2. The new harvest of the Tehran district will be purchased at 190 rials (nearly 45s. at the current rate of 85 rials to a pound sterling) the kharvar (300 kilog.); at Kazvin, the price will be 150 rials (about 35s. 3d.); at Zendjan, 140 rials (about 33s.); at Kermanshah, 120 rials (about 28s. 3d.), &amp;c. 3 .

As most of the new industries which are springing up in Persia are State-owned, the present announcement is no doubt largely inspired by the desire to avoid excessive competition from private interests with those owned by the State or by His Majesty the Shah. In cases where no such competition is likely to arise in the near future, the necessary permission will probably be issued as a matter of course by the Department of Industry. A tightening-up of the Govern ment’s efforts towards the control and direction of industry as well as commerce is, nevertheless, implicit in this new announcement. 3.

Sir, I hava the honour to report that a notification appeared in the local press on the 10th October last to tue effect that the Ministry of Finance had decided to exercise a rigorous control over all provincial administrations. For this purpose provincial administrations were divided into fifteen areas, and two controllers, one for finance and the other for justice* were appointed for each of tnese press but according to information obtained casually and privately at the Ministry of Finance, the position is as follows ihe matter was first under consideration when Taghisadeh was Minister of Finance, but it was not actually put into effect. One general inspection was carried out with apparently gratifying results as no sensational irregularities were brought to light. The system has now been modified and the country has been divided into five sections 1. Central - namely Tehran* Sultanabad* Uum and the 'Sdareh-i-Salas. 2. Northern - covering Gilan and 1 azendran. 3. Eastern - covering two sub-sections: one up to areas. No further communication was published in the Neishapur and the other from Neishapur upward.

It is said to be feared that strict inspections would lead to the dismissal of employees of the Ministry of Finance, a development which would be inconvenient as there are no suitable officials to replace them. 3.

THE Ministry for Foreign Affairs has recently announced a series of changes in their representatives abroad. It will be seen from the details recorded below that practically all the important foreign missions, with the exception of Moscow. Angora, Kabul, and possibly Washington, are either being entrusted to new officials or are receiving important alterations in their staffs. 2. To begin with London, Mirza Muhammad Khan Shayesteh is being sent as Charge d’Affaires with the rank of counsellor, to replace the present incumbent, Mirza Fathullah Khan Noury Esfandiary. Shayesteh (his name means “ the deserving one”) is a dapper little man, whose father was a merchant. He received a legal education at Tehran, and in 1921 and 1922 was one of the judges of the civil section of the tribunal of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He was subsequently employed in the Ministry, and served for a time as secretary at Berne. He then took charge (in about 1929) of the section of the Ministry which deals with America and Western Europe. When Mirza Chaffar Khan Jalal went to Washington in the spring of 1933, Shayesteh took over from him, in addition, the direction of the section which deals with British affairs. He is a pleasant man to deal with, very voluble in Persian, but not quite so voluble in French, of which, however, he has a fair knowledge. He tells me that he is studying English with the help of Linguaphone gramophone records, but his knowledge of English is so far very small. I think he has done his best to help this Legation in various matters, and as he is undoubtedly both able and active, his help has often been most effective. I understand that he is unmarried. 3. Seyyid Hasan Khan Taqi-zadeh (No. 43 of the 1932 personalities), the new Minister at Paris, is well known to your Department. He was recalled from the post of Minister in London to be Minister of Roads and Communications in April 1930, and he took over the Ministry of Finance in the following August. His part in the cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession is familiar to you. He left the Ministry suddenly in September last, and was supposed at the time to have incurred the Shah’s displeasure. If so, he appears to have regained it now. He has already left for his new post. Meanwhile, it has just been announced that Mirza Moussa Khan Noury Isfandiary (a cousin of the present Charge d’Affaires in London) has been transferred from the post of counsellor at Paris to the same post at Moscow. The new counsellor at Paris is to be Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Humayun, hitherto in charge of the personnel section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The latter, who confesses to never having been outside Persia before except for a few days’ inspection at Moscow, knows hardly any French and shows very little sign of any intelligence. 4. A new Minister for Berlin, named Mirza AbuT Qasim Khan Najm formerly known as Najm-ul-Mulk), has just been appointed, and has already left for his post. He has served for some years in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, his principal post being that of head of the Passport section. For the last three years, however, he has been Director-General of the Ministry of Finance. He has no obvious qualifications for the post of Minister at Berlin. He speaks French, but is said to be ignorant of German. His counsellor is to be Mirza AbuT Qasim Khan Pourevaly, hitherto head of the Passport, Nationality and Civil Status section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, a post in which he has continued, under an outward air of friendliness, to make a good deal of trouble for the Legation, especially in questions arising out of the Persian Nationality Law. The latter has served in Brussels as secretary, and was one of the judges in the civil section of the tribunal of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1922-23: he knows no German. 5. The present Minister at Cairo, Mirza Jawad Khan Sineki, is recalled and is being replaced by Mirza Sultan Ahmad Khan Rad. The latter has served [15 q—2]as head of the section of the Ministry for Foreign Ahairs known previously as the “ Section des Pays non-limitrophes.” He has also been in charge oi the accounts department of the Ministry, and has lately served as one ol the judges, or, rather, advisers or “counsellors,” of the “ Cour de Cassation at lehran. He is not known personally to members of this Legation, but is thought to be an intelligent man. The first secretary at Cairo (a post held until recently by Ghulam Hussein Khan Ibtihaj) is now to be Mirza Jawad Khan Kazemi, from^^ the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 6 . Mirza Anushirvan Khan Sipahbudi, who was at Berne at the time of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company crisis, is now to go to Rome as Minister. It will be remembered that he was recalled to Tehran about the beginning of last summer to the post of Assistant to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It seems strange that he should be sent abroad again so soon. He is regarded as a capable and intelligent official, rather above the average in ability, and I am sorry that he is leaving the Ministry. He says that he is delighted to think that he will have the privilege of serving as a colleague of Sir Eric Drummond, for whom he has a high admiration. Mirza Muhammad Khan Habib, hitherto first secretary at Paris, is to be transferred in the same rank to Rome. 7. The Persian diplomatic representative at Jedda is to be Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Muqaddam (or Mughaddam). He has served at St. Petersburg as a member of the Persian Embassy; he has been for a time secretary at the Persian Legation in London; and has since been Persian consul- general at Tashkent. For about the last two years he has been “ chef de cabinet ” (a sort of private secretary to the Minister) at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He has a Persian wife, who is modern enough to attend parties without her veil! Muqaddam has already left for his post. I am not quite sure whether he has the actual rank of Minister or not. 8 . Prince Nadir Mirza Arasteh is appointed Persian Minister at Warsaw, in succession to Assad Khan Assad-Bahadur, who has taken over the post of head of the Protocol Department at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, instead of Mirza Farrukh Khan Braghon. Arasteh, a pleasant little man, is, of course, a Qajar. He has served as Governor of Enzeli, and as Deputy, or Vice-Governor, of Azerbaijan. From that appointment he was made Governor of Khuzistan in May 1932. He left that post suddenly last summer, and it was rumoured that he had fallen into disgrace. If so, he has evidently come back to favour. He speaks English and French, and, I believe, Russian. 9. Mirza Farrukh Khan Braghon, who, as mentioned above, has been in charge of the Protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, has recently left Tehran to take over the post of consul-general at Constantinople. His duties also include the consular representation of Persia in Greece and the Balkan States. He was educated partly at Harrow, and speaks English, Russian and French just as well as, if not better than, he does Persian. His handling of the questions of protocol during the last few years has given rise to a good many complaints by the Diplomatic Body. Braghon, however, always managed to explain away his tiresomenesses by skilful references to Government regulations, to decisions of the Conseil des Ministres, to French books of law and diplomatic procedure, &amp;c. He was always pleasant to meet socially, and perhaps we can put down a good deal of the friction as an inevitable concomitant of modern ultra nationalist Persia. During the last two years at any rate he has often been most helpful to this Legation, even though his help often took the form of finding a way round difficulties of his own invention. His wife is a Caucasian by birth who speaks French. The new “ chef de protocole,” Assad Khan Assad-Bahadur, is Braghon’s brother. 10. Mirza ’Inayatullah Khan Sami’i, formerly Minister at Berlin, has, I understand, already arrived at Bagdad as Persian Minister. This will be his second incumbency of that post. (He is No.' 39 of the 1932 personalities.) 11 . I have heard several rumours that Mirza Ghaffar Khan Jalal, now Minister at Washington, is to be replaced. 12 . It is not at present known what post will be given to Fathullah Khan Noury Esfandiary. Shayesteh thinks he might take his own place as head of the Western Europe and America section. 13. What the meaning of this very remarkable and sudden game of “ General Post ” may be I am unable to say. When the present Prime Minister’s brother went to Berne as Minister this year (at about the same time as Mirzar 3 Hassan Ali Khan Ghaffary went to Brussels) we were led to believe that one of Feroughi’s main duties would be to look after the Vali-’ahd and prepare him for the throne. Since then we have heard rumours of the Shah next year making an extensive grand tour of Europe, in addition to going to Berlin for an operation and visiting Switzerland to see his son. Perhaps the series of changes in European capitals described above means that His Majesty feels that he cannot ^ust anyone who has been away from Tehran more than a year or so, and insists on having men from Tehran to prepare the way before him. I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARETHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT I HAVE the honour to report, in continuation of the information trans mitted under cover of my despatch No. 719 of the 16th instant, that several statements, evidently of an official character, have been published in various Persian newspapers explaining the antecedents of the late Jewish Deputy, Haim, and giving reasons for his execution. 2. The most detailed statement appeared in the newspaper “ Shafagh-i- Surkh of the 17th December. It was first mentioned that Haim was employed in the intelligence service of the British troops who occupied the north of Persia in 1918-20, and in that capacity performed many functions inimical to national interests. The next charge against Haim was that he was instrumental in causing, by false promises, a number of unfortunate Jews to leave their beloved fatherland of Persia and suffer untold agonies as emigrants to Palestine. Then, being enraged at failure to secure re-election to the Majlis in its sixth term, he took part in a revolutionary plot against the present regime. One of his fellow- conspirators (Colonel Fooladin) was shot and the others imprisoned when the plot was discovered. The examination of Haim was only concluded a few days previously; the Military Court, after having considered the accused man’s baseless defence, agreed to the military public prosecutor’s demands for a capital sentence, and the execution took place. 3. This official statement is, no doubt, the last word of the Persian Govern ment in the matter. It shows plainly that Haim was examined, if at all, only before a secret military court, which had no jurisdiction over him, a civilian; that no definite evidence was produced against him (for, if it had, the official statement would surely have said what it was); and that, in fact, Haim was suddenly executed without a regular trial. I am informed that another of the Persians who were imprisoned in 1926 under a charge of treason, named Major Ruhullah Khan, is now at liberty and maintains that the whole accusation of treason was a complete fabrication. I have no information concerning the story of Kaim’s employment with the British forces at the end of the war. As for the execution of Colonel Fooladin, in 1926, 1 am informed that when the death warrant was prepared for signature, the then chief of staff. General Shaibani refused to sign it, though strongly pressed to do so bv His Majesty the Shah who finally signed it himself. PERSIA. January 19, 1932. . CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. E 300/53/34] No. 1 .

Minute by Oriental Secretary. HAIM, formerly Jewish deputy for the Majlis. I hear this morning that Haim has been executed in prison shortly after midnight on the night of the 14th/15th December and buried yesterday. This event caused greatyfexcitement among the Jews, large numbers of whom attended his funeral and many Jewish shops were shut by way of protest. Haim was the Jewish representative in the Persian Majlis MP to 1926. In the summer of that year he was suddenly arrested and thrown into prison where he has been ever since. One or two military officers were similarly treated, and a Colonel named Fooladin was \if my memory is correct) shot. Ho regular trial was held on any of these people but it was circulated abroad that they v/ere guilty of a plot to murder the Shah and Haim was 'sentenced” to perpetual imprisonment. Haim was feramut known to have had friendly relations with r.H&amp;vard, and I received (when acting for Kr.Havard) visits from his unfortunate relations requesting assistance. Nothing could be done. It happened that a rival candidate for the / Jewish representation in tho Majlis was in the field, and the Majlis elections were in full swing at the time, so the rival got into the Majlis helped by Haim’s disgrace. Mr.Nicolson and I were surprised that no representations were made at the time in Haim’s favour by the Zionist Committee in London, as Haim was their Tehran representative : Mit somehow or other this did not happen. I suppose the i iv.^l / \ blackened / y2 - blaokened his nan« # Haim was an energetic man, rather a talker, but in my opinion much too sensible to have slotted against the Shah. While in prison he is reported to have feigned madness. His sudden execution is connected in some Jewish minds with Mr.Havard 1 s departure. So perishes another of Reza*s victims. He was never publicly tried or found guilty. Hio execution after five year's prison is a strange prpeedure. Initialled) A.C.T. 16/12/193.Notes. Minute Paper. SECRET. © POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.

The late Ministers review is an interesting, if depressing, document.

Sir Robert Clive, in the light of his Chinese experience, remarks that 'undisciplined forces are as great a danger as bandits. I have some reason, therefore, for considering the present state of affairs very disquieting. 1j % iiiservice. The service actually started in April 1929. In the autumn, on my return from leave, negotiations were begun for a commercial treaty and a general treaty to settle all outstanding questions. 0 . Meanwhile, the new nationalism which was to regenerate Persia and convert her from a backward Asiatic State to a progressive and enlightened member of the League of Nations was moving apace. The National Bank wa^ founded in the summer of 1928, with a German as chief manager. A German- American syndicate received a contract to construct some 200 miles of railway in the north and south as the initial stages of the great trunk line, a French wireless expert was engaged to take charge of the high-powered wireless station in Tehran, which was to render Persia independent in her outside communications of the telegraphic land lines; negotiations were set on foot with Italy through the medium of two specially engaged Italian naval officers for the training in that country of Persian naval cadets and the eventual purchase of a small fleet of warships. A financial adviser, a forestry expert and a mining engineer were engaged from Germany. From France came a number of school teachers, a public health adviser, who was to assist in the foundation of a great central hospital in Tehran on grandiose lines, and an archaeologist and fine arts adviser, who was to found a national museum, while, as an aftermath of the Millspaugh Financial Mission, there still remained an American adviser on road construction and an American railway engineer to supervise the work of the German-American syndicate. No branch of the public service appeared to have been neglected. At the same time, as a further milestone on the road to progress, the national costume of the long pleated frock coat and “ Kola ” (a black fez) was, by Imperial order, changed to a short jacket and peaked cap—the famous Pahlavi hat. 7. In November 1928, on the occasion of the opening of the newly-elected Majlis, the Prime Minister read out a speech (drafted, as^I subsequently learnt, by the Minister of Court) in which pointed allusions were made to the necessity of revising and modernising certain old concessions. Those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Indo-European Telegraph Department were clearly indicated. It is unnecessary to enter into the details of these concessions or into the manner in which these different institutions reacted to the hint. Suffice it to say that Sir John Cadman with a large staff came out to Tehran a few months later (in February 1929) in an attempt to negotiate a revision and, at the same time, a prolongation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concessions. The attempt failed, but negotiations have not actually been broken off, although Teymourtache, with a view to blackmailing the company into offering better terms, recently instituted in an organ of the Tehran press a most venomous and libellous attack upon them. The bank made no move until a year later their hand was forced, and for the sum of £ 200,000 in cash and certain minor privileges they agreed to renounce, as from 1931, their right of note issue. The challenge to the Indo-European Telegraph Department resulted in the conclusion last September by the Government of India of an agreement with the recently-formed Cable and Wireless Company to withdraw the Telegraph Department entirely from Persia, as a corollary of which the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which had already been absorbed by the Cable and Wireless Company, was simultaneously withdrawn on the 1 st March of this year. Persia is thus left in undisputed possession of the land lines, but without the means of using them for an international service or, it may be added, the competence to do so. A telegraph service to Europe is, however, still maintained by land line to Bushire and thence by cable via India. 8 . Up to the spring of 1929 the programme of national regeneration appeared to be making headway. In April, however, a serious outbreak occurred in the Province of Ears. The Qashgai and a portion of the Khamseh tribes revolted, and it was feared at one time that the Bakhtiari would join them. Not until the autumn did the movement die down, but it cannot be said that the Persian Government succeeded in suppressing it; in fact, they yielded to most of the tribesmen’s demands. An attempt was, as usual, made to make His Majesty’s Government the scapegoat. It was said that we had supplied the tribesmen with arms, and that His Majesty’s consul in Shiraz, disguised as a Dervish, was helping them with advice! Finally, what can only be described as the great Lawrence myth (that is, the rumoured presence of Colonel Lawrence wherever trouble was to be found) was regenerated in order to put the seal on our perfidy in an attempt to exculpate the shortcomings of the Persian army. One3 interesting sequel to this tribal revolt was the downfall of Firuz Mirza, the Minister of Finance. The Shah, wrapt fn a maze of suspicion, conjured up the idea of a Qajar rising. Firuz, as a Qajar Prince, was arrested, as was his cousin, Akbar Mirza, the Governor-General of Fars. His Majesty even felt doubts as to whether the Minister of Court was entirely above suspicion. New elements hostile to Teymourtache were introduced into the Cabinet, and it was Several months before His Highness regained his old ascendancy. 9. Meanwhile, in August, the Lawrence bogey having been successfully laid for the time being, negotiations for a general treaty and a commercial treaty with His Majesty's Government were once more resumed. As was to be expected, the Persian demands were exorbitant. They not only included the remission of the whole pre-war and war-time debt, but the cancellation of all claims, the cession of the islands of Tamb and Bu Musa and the provision of a fleet of gunboats and patrol boats. Discussions went on through the autumn. They continued intermittently until the autumn of 1930, since when they have been in abeyance. The points at issue have been greatly narrowed down, and if the Persians were genuine in their desire to reach a settlement, both treaties could very soon be concluded. 10 . By November 1929, coinciding with the beginning of the slump in America, black clouds again appeared on the horizon. Silver, on which the Persian currency is based, was falling rapidly in value. The exchange rate of the kran had fallen from 50 to 70 to the £. The Imperial Bank of Persia was accused of manipulating the exchange for their own base ends. It cannot be said that the Imperial Bank rose to the occasion or met the situation with skill. They certainly did not. They offered advice, it is true, as to how to meet the situation, but scornfully repelled the proposals of the National Bank that the exchange rate should be fixed in agreement between the two banks. Dr. Lindenblatt seized the opportunity to disparage the Imperial Bank and to incite the Minister of Court against this “obstructive and unhelpful British institution/’ with the result that, in February 1930, a law was passed under which a commission was appointed to fix the rate of exchange from day to day. This commission was dominated by the German manager of the National Bank, and the rate was arbitrarily fixed at 60 krans to the £. The Imperial Bank’s control of exchange was gone' for ever. Dr. Lindenblatt had, indeed, succeeded in his object of undermining the position of the Imperial Bank and of establishing the National Bank in a privileged position. It was indifferent to him whether the rate fixed was economically justified or not. With the help of Government funds which were temporarily placed at his disposal, he was able to sell exchange and draw away many of the old clients of the Imperial Bank. Simultaneously a law was passed establishing, as from March 1931, a currency based on gold. But here it was impossible to ignore the Imperial Bank, as under their concession they still had for another twenty years the sole right of note issue. A bargain was eventually made under which the bank's right was bought out for the inadequate sum of £ 200,000 and certain privileges granted which included their being placed on an equality with the National Bank for ordinary banking business. 1 he Imperial Bank undoubtedly could have, and should have, obtained an additional £ 100,000 for their right of note issue. 11. Bv the autumn of 1930 the economic situation had become, as it still remains, the main issue in Persian politics, although Persia has probably been affected much less than most countries by the world economic depression. The arbitrary fixing of the kran at the rate of 60 to the £ (later raised to 90) was done in 'defiance of expert advice, and resulted, as was anticipated, in wholesale evasion. Business continues to be done outside the banks at the bazaar rate, and it is quite beyond the power of the Government to stop this. 12. The gold exchange law, another phantasy of the Minister of Court, seems equallv doomed to failure. The intention was to bring the new currency (1 Pahlavi = £l. 1 rial = Is.) into force in March of this year, but this has now been postponed until September. The public are quite in the dark on the subject. Nothing is known as to how it is proposed to control the new currency, while the bankers fail to see how it will be possible to keep it from going to a discount. 13. Finally, the Trade Monopoly Law can only, if persisted in, have the effect of ruining the country’s commerce. This law, designed by Teymourtache in imitation of the Soviet system of State trading, and forced through the Majlis without discussion last February, purports to control, under the Government, by [200 1—5] b 2 Qa system of permits and licences, the whole import and export trade oi the country. The Persians have not the experience, capacity or organisation to administer successfully such a highly complicated law. ISobody wants it; the officials don't even profess to understand it. A few merchants who are able to obtain import licences may, for a while, succeed in making profits, but among the public there is growing dissatisfaction. All three measures are the work of Teymourtache and have been forced on the country in defiance of the principle, of sound finance and economics and contrary to expert advice. The news that the Minister of Court is escorting the 12 -year old Crown Prince in September to Europe is widely interpreted to mean that his Highness will make a prolonged absence abroad. His former popularity is gone, although he still enjoys the unbounded confidence and support of the Shah. It is believed that he is going away to escape the odium of this ill-starred legislation which could the more easily be rescinded in his absence. How far this may be true it is difficult to say, but there can be little doubt that his Highness must now realise that his ■economic policy has been a failure. 14. And what of the various schemes and enterprises referred to in paragraph 6 above? In spite of Dr. Lindenblatt’s success in asserting the position of the National Bank against his British rival, it is too early as yet to say that the National Bank has made good. Their overhead expenses are out of all proportion to their profits, they have no standing abroad and have yet to gain the confidence of the Persian public, while many of the young foreign ■educated Persian employees already are thinking that they know better than the German managers. 15. And the railway, the great trunk line from the Caspian to the Persian Gridf ? So far some £4 million has been sunk in this enterprise, and in the universal opinion the money might just as usefully have been sunk in one of the seas which the line is so optimistically destined to connect. What has actually been constructed is about 50 miles more or less solidly in the north connecting a still non-existent port on the Caspian with a small village near the foot of the pass leading up to the great plateau, and in the south far less solidly some 150 miles from a deep water inlet east of the Shatt-el-Arab, where no port exists, to the town of Dizful, just south of the welter of limestone mountains that constitute the Province of Luristan. It is not for me to criticise the work of railway'engineers, but there is little doubt that the German group in the north, with a greater understanding of Persian psychology, have at least produced a roadbed on which a train can travel. There are also imposing stations and iron bridges. The Persians suspect they have been made to pay a prohibitive price—70,000 dollars a kilometre in the north compared with 24.000 dollars a kilometre in the south—‘but at least there is something to show for it however useless it in fact may be. In the south, the American group from the first sacrificed quality to quantity, and they were not favoured by fortune. The Shah visited the southern section in January 1930. The Americans had certainly laid the lines, but exceptionally heavy rain coinciding with His Majesty’s visit made it quite impossible to keep the train on the flimsily built track. The Shah’s coach was derailed, not once but twice. The Americans were accused of doing the work, not merely badly, but expensively, and on the 1st May the Persian Government rescinded the contract. The rails have since acquired an even more irresponsible and serpentine appearance, while the rolling-stock has greatly deteriorated. The Persians have now engaged at large salaries a Japanese and a Belgian engineer as supervisors, and entrusted the construction work to an American engineer in their employment. The only solid thing in the south is the big iron bridge over the Karun at Ahwaz supplied by an English firm and put in place by British riveters. All the other bridges are of wood, the intention being to replace them later by iron bridges. But the Persians cannot understand this; the work seemed shoddy and bad to them compared with the German work in the north. The Americans hoped to impress the Shah by the speed with which they had constructed 150 miles of line. He was only impressed by the fact that trains appeared unable to run on the line at all. No one can say what will be the outcome. It is estimated that it will cost at least £500,000 to put the southern section in working order, and when this is done there still remains the huge central section of some 600 miles, the cost of which has been estimated at not less than £30 million, if the original alignment of a standard-gauge railway is to be maintained. I have been told that, of thea six imposing German locomotives imported for the northern section, three are already out of order owing to the inexperience and inefficiency of the young half- trained Persian engineers who were sent to take charge of them, and that the Belgian engineer has gone home in despair. It almost looks as though General Shaibani's remark when the Railway Bill was passed may yet come true : ‘‘ All that will be seen of the railway in hive years’ time will be a few rusty rails here ®and there.” The tragedy of it all is that no one, either Persian or foreign, has ever had the courage or the honesty to warn the Shah of the appalling wastage of the country’s limited resources involved in the railway scheme. The German and American contractors could hardly be expected to do so, but the Minister of ( ourt must long since have realised the position, and I have little doubt that with the disappearance of the Shah the whole thing would be dropped. 16. Of the Persian navy it is too early to judge. Two gunboats—it is believed of 1,000 tons—and four small patrol vessels have been ordered in Italy for delivery this autumn and the first deposit paid. The intention apparently is to base them on Bushire, although no docking facilities exist there, and no provision has been made for dredging the very shallow channel leading to the inner harbour. Where the officers and crews are to come from remains to be seen, although it is probable that there will at first be not less than twenty Italian officers. The very considerable cost of upkeep appears so far to have been over looked. One cannot help feeling that the Persian navy is going to be a very expensive luxury and will be as useless and unremunerative an investment as the trunk railway. 17. The German financial adviser, who left Tehran in the autumn of 1930 on the completion of his two years’ contract, is now to be succeeded by a Belgian. Dr. Schniewind was a competent Prussian official, whose advice, however, was never accepted. He left Persia with relief and disgust—relief at giving up an entirely thankless office in which he felt he was but wasting his time; disgust at the appalling state of corruption which permeated every section of the community from the highest in the land downwards. It is no exaggeration to say that, with the exception of a few of the senior Cabinet Ministers, every public appointment is paid for. A young Deputy actually admitted that he had paid Teymourtache 14,000 tomans for the position. Every Minister abroad pays for the appointment. One and all hope to recoup themselves for the capital outlay by illegitimate methods, and all those who have had long experience of this country are agreed that corruption is more universally rife to-day than at any time within their experience. I may mention, as an instance, the following case vouchsafed to me by the head of Junkers : 55,000 tomans was voted in last year’s budget for upkeep of aerodromes. Exactlv 132 tomans was spent, the remainder going into the pockets of various officials from the head of the Persian Military Air Service downwards. With a view, however, to throwing dust in the eyes of the world, Firuz Mirza, a notoriously corrupt Minister, was put on trial last year for malversa tion of public funds. Although convicted on one or two minor charges, the major charge was not proved. The severe sentence he received was by the Shah's orders for political motives. At the same time, it is almost impossible to obtain the payment of debts by Persians, either public or private. There would appear to be an almost entire absence in public life of any moral sense. In business, I am told, the merchant is less unscrupulous. 18. The experience of other advisers and experts appointed by the Persian Government has been similar to that of Dr. Schniewind. The German forestry expert carefully explored the forest areas of Mazanderan and submitted reports, to which no attention was even paid, and has now been succeeded by a Frenchman. The French public health adviser is apparently content to draw his salary and do nothing, while M. Godard, whose main duty as fine arts adviser and archaeological expert Is to create a national museum, found, on his return after a temporary absence from Tehran, that the financial estimates for his work had simply been cut out from the budget. He has succeeded in making a collection for the Govern ment of valuable bronzes from Luristan, but keeps them in locked packing cases for fear that the Minister of Education should take them and sell them for his own profit! There is no museum in Persia, and M. Godard has not found one single Persian to take the smallest interest in his work of founding one.19. No foreigner who has lived in Tehran during the past two years has failed to notice the growing anti-foreign tendency, which is known to be directly inspired by the Shah. The military have definite instructions to have no relations with the foreign Legations in general and the military attaches in particular. Intercourse of the latter with Persian officers is confined to occasional visits to the Chief of Staff, who always professes profound ignorance of every subject mentioned. Provincial Governors now openly warn the people to have as little as ^ possible to do with foreigners, while the list of Persians who may accept invita tions to the Legations is strictly checked. Recent reports from consular officers state that at the King’s birthday party this year no Persian official other than the Governor or his deputy was allowed to be present, although in several instances other officials in friendly relations with the consul privately apologised for their absence. The only possible explanation of this attitude is the suspicion of the Shah himself, with whom suspicion of all and sundry has now become an obsession—accentuated with every year that he lives. The Minister of Court would appear to encourage this attitude. He has made it practically impossible for any Persian either to approach the Shah directly or to reach His Majesty by the system—time-honoured in the East—of written petitions, nor can any of the foreign representatives now have an opportunity of speaking openly to His Majesty, as they may no longer bring their own interpreters. So far as the people in general are concerned, I have no reason to believe that there is any anti-foreign feeling at all, either in Tehran or in the provinces. It is a purely artificial growth and, if the mot d'ordre were changed, would disappear. 20. Lest you should think that I have been attempting to draw an unduly pessimistic picture of Persia to-day, I would wish the following observations to be considered in conjunction with the foregoing criticisms. 21. The Shah, for all his narrow-mindedness, which is largely due to lack of education, his avaricious and suspicious nature, is unquestionably a patriot according to his own light. I would even say the same for Teymourtache, whose devotion to the Shah is undoubted. The underlying motives of both men are, I honestly believe, the regeneration of Persia. The Shah has in ten years built up a military force of some 40,000 men, which is incomparably superior to any Persian army of the past, even though it cannot yet be classed with any modern army. Security is more or less generally established, communications by road have been greatly extended, municipal government under the control of the Central Government has been inaugurated in all the principal towns, while a system of justice exists which, however faulty, at least shows some improvements on the past. 22 . The great stumbling-block, however, as I see it, to any serious progress in Persia, as has always been the case in former times, is the Persian ignorance of the elementary principles of finance, an ignorance, moreover, which, owing to the national characteristics of superficiality, self-satisfaction and arrogance, the Persian will never admit. It is very difficult to understand why the Persian Government should continually engage, at considerable expense, foreign advisers and then not merely ignore their advice but almost invariably do precisely what they have been advised not to do. If Persia is heading for national bankruptcy, as would almost appear to be the case, it is entirely her own fault. I have no hesitation in saying that if the Persian Government were prepared to-day to engage a first-class financial adviser with a select staff under him, give him executive powers, listen to his advice and then act upon it, there need be no question of bankruptcy or even of a serious -economic crisis. But she never will. In addition to the characteristics mentioned, one has to remember the inherent distrustfulness and suspicion of every Persian, not only of every other Persian but of every foreigner in Persian employment. He cannot believe that any man is honest or disinterested. During my first year here, when the days of the Millspaugh financial mission were evidently numbered, attempts were made to invent charges of corruption and misappropriation of funds against practically every member of the mission. The Persian hates to think that the foreigner should make money out of him or his country and simply cannot believe that every single foreigner he employs does not try to do so. I consider this ingrained suspiciousness the greatest^f modern-day Persia. A sparsely populated, self-supporting agricultural country with few wants should have no difficulty in making ends meet. If Persian finances were honestly administered under careful (£md stringent control, and wild-cat schemes for trunk railways and warships abandoned, Persia would be relatively rich and prosperous. As it is,with no conception of the elements of sound finance, refusing to listen to or act upon good advice, Persia seems bound to remain a poor and backward country. She has a genius for irritating her neighbours and such ingrained distrust of -every other country that she is, and likely to remain always, as now, without any real friend. 23. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. P.S., July 1 .—On reading through this despatch in type I feel there is one important point to which I have not drawn sufficient attention. I refer to the artificial growth of militarism in what is essentially an unmilitary country. The arrogance and indiscipline towards the civil population of the officers and men of this new army are growing more marked. /I he Persian soldier to-day carrying his rifle does not hesitate to level it at any civilian on the slightest provocation, real or imagined. On the public highways this is a growing danger. Freight lorries and even private cars are considered fair game by the soldiery, who force the drivers by threats to give them free lifts. There have been frequent cases of the unfortunate drivers being brutally assaulted. In the provinces, and even in Tehran and the immediate neighbourhood, rape and robbery by young undisciplined soldiers are on the increase. I he newly enrolled conscripts are among the worst offenders. No redress can ever be obtained. C omplaints to the Ministry of War are simply unheeded. Meanwhile the bhah is ever increasing the size of the army. It is said that he aims eventually at an army of 100,000 men. Two years ago there were 35 , 000 , to-day there are 41,000. The cost is approximately 45 per cent, of the annual revenues of the country, 'which neithei requires, wants, nor can afford so large a force. The danger which ten years ago existed from banditry is to-day tending to increase from the forces called into being to suppress it. Having spent three years in ( hina since tne vai, I know that undisciplined forces are as great a danger as bandits. I have some reason therefore for considering the present state of affairs ver\ disquieting. R. H. C.Notes. Minute Paper. Register No. P.Z SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Dated ttec. 19 Date. Initials.
