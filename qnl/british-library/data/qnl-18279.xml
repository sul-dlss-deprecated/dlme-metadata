Sheil opines that it would not be at all advisable to allow the maratime [maritime] chiefs to suppose that they could redress their grievances by their own means. Instead, Sheil argues that the best course of action would be for Hennell to act on the permission formerly given by the Govenor of Fars to repress and punish acts of piracy. Sheil instructs Hennell to capture at sea one of the boats of the Sheikh of Nabend, but to do so with a large enough force to preclude any resistance from the pirates.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x00002c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
