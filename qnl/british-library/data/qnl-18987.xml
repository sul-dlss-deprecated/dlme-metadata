Some of the folios later on in the file have suffered from water damage, which has made some of the text illegible.Foliation: There is a foliation sequence, which is written in pencil, in the top right corner of the recto of each folio. It should be noted that the following anomalies are present in the sequence: f 1 is followed by f 1A; f 111 is followed by f 111A; f 112 is followed by f 112A. Also present are letters and numbers written in blue crayon, which belong to an internal referencing sequence. The aforementioned foliation sequence is the sequence which has been used by this catalogue to reference items within the file.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file consists almost entirely of letters written by the Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the Commander of the Indian Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf, Bassidore [Bāsa‘īdū].
