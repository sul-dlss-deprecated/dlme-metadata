I should explain that v/e at last managed to find a bidder for the Town Residency property after the Customs decided that they were not interested, and that this bidder is also prepared, if he eta the property, to provide for the church. He' would not agree to exclude the land on which the church stands from the sale, but he has offered lo allow the C.M.S. to have the land rent free in perpetuity together with an adjoining upstairs and downstairs room for use by a resident watchman and visiting priest. This would probably cover the area bounded, on the sketch enclosed in Bishop Thompson's letter of 25th September, by the letters 1, C, F, E, D, C, B, X, though we have not yet received precise details of the proposal. ’ When the Bishop called yesterday he was inclined to suspect the proposal, as' indicating an intention on the part of the bidder to j-et* rid of the C.M.S. at some future date a ^ providingeven less security of tenure in the event of the whole property changing hands. The ^ Ambassador took the line, however, that the present proposal might well be the best solution obtainable and that the bidder f s reluctance to part with the land outright might be due to no more than a fear that the C.M.S. might one day wish or be forced to put the land to another use or even to sell it^ ' in which case serious damage might be done to his interests. The Bishop, of course, wanted to get more of the land surrounding the church, and this s covered in the enclosed telegram. We will report as soon as we get news that «he bidder and the .5. have reached common ground, but I am sending you this advance information so that you may khOw how the land lies. I do not think that it will be necessary for you to pursue the question of a free gift from the Government of India' or H.M.G. but of course the fact that the C.K.S. are allowed to remai will be reflected in the bidder f s ultimate price. There is no doubt that the existence ' of en enclave in the property will materiallv reduce Its value.

(, As agreed at our interview some days ago I am writing now to explain in more detail exactly how the situation stands in Bushire and to ask that the small area occupied by the church build ing itself and a small area adjacent to it should be handed over to the Church in Iran whenever the government property in Bushire is sold or otherwise disposed of. The church was built on the present site during the time when Sir Geoffrey Prior was Political Resident in the Gulf. It was he who allocated the ground and personally gave the greater oart of the money for the building. The rest was provided by public and private subscription. It was Sir Geoffrey himself who handed over the official documents to me at the consecration of the building in the presence of the local Irani government official^ It would be a great disservice both to the British name and to the Christian cause if this church were now to be dismantled and^sold. I have enquired about the disposal of the government churches and vicarages in India and Pakistan, and I find that these have all been .handed over inCtact to the Indian church free of any charge. It would surely be desirable for the British government to be as generous and to follow the precedent set by the two Dominion Governments. I ask therefore that this may be done. I asked the Rev.R.II. Sharp to make a small sketch of the actual-lay out of the ground so as to indicate exactly what we think might be reasonably made over to the church. While of course the sketches are not drawn to scale yet they do give an acurate idea of the buildings. I have indicated by the letters ABCDEFGH the area we should like to have. This would protect the church on all sides and provide room for a small set of rooms for the visiting priest or missionary when he goes down from Shiraz for services about every two or three months. ^t also provides a small room for a caretaker on the opposite sine of tae church. I hone I have made the position clear and that we may soon come to a satisfactory arrangement about the property. I expect 00wammi be leaving this country on October 3rd. for Baghdad on my way back to Iran. If the matter cannot be settled before I leave will you please communicate with me at Bishop*s house, Isfahan, Iran, which is the address which will always find me. Yours s incerely . n..

This little church, while standing on Government property, was built by private subscription; the building itself, therefore, is not strictly speaking Government property. It has for years served the spiritual needs of the Christian conmunity in Bushire. It is now being served regularly by myself once a month. It is perhaps the most beautiful church in this country. It has stone arches, fine tile work, and contains windows of very rare hand-made Persian glass, each one of which is a museum piece. It was constructed with great labour and personal effort by myself. w The total area of the church building is only 160 square yards, whereas the area of the town offices and compounds in which it is situated must be about 5000 square yards. I desire urgently to request that this small piece of property,which opens directly on to a side street, and has a frontage of only 50 feet may be disposed of directly to us at any reasonable figure. It would not do ihe British name any good that it should be known that they had closed and sold a church, which was in regular use.. May I therefore request that the Consular Property /in the town1 1 in the town' of Bushire nay he sold MINUS rKE CHURCH, and we he permitted to purchase j rom he present owners the ground on which the church r^ands at an agreed figure. iTo ^ fD ^Tould he incurred hy this procedu: e.

One is a letter addressed by him to Ogden about the Church at Bushire and the otner a protest on the same subject signed by all members of the British community at Shiraz. As you may remember the C.M.S. churches at Shiraz and Bushire are little gems of beauty and good t&amp;ste c*nd are both in regular use. I thin^; therefore that the C.M.S. has a very strong case and I earnestly hope that H.M.G. will maAe a point of excluding the church and the land on which it stands from the consular property at Bashire which is now up for sale. - May I have a copy of the present letter for transmission to the Bishop who is at present in this country?
