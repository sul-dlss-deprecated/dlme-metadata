T HE first European power to enter into relations with Persia was the Republic of Venice, which sent a successful mission in 1464. In 1507 the Portuguese under Albuquerque seized the Island of Ormaz. In 1561 Turkey concluded a treaty with Persia: and in the same year Sir Anthony Jenkinson visited the court of Shah Tamasp I as the Envoj 7 of Queen Elizabeth, but met with a cold reception. About forty years later an adventurous Englishman, Sir Anthony Sherley, visited Persia. Shah Abbas the Great appointed him as his Envoy to establish an alliance with the Christian monarchs of Europe for the destruction of the Turks: and gave him a grant* permitting all Christian merchants to trade freely with Persia.

Shah Abbas died in 1628. Under the weak rule of his successors the Turks severed from the Persian Empire some of the best of the western provinces: the Arab ruler of Muscat possessed himself of the islands in the Persian Gulf: and the Abdali Afghans made themselves independent in Herat, and the Ghilzais in Kandahar. In 1639 Shah Safi IV signed a treaty with Turkey which delimited afresh the frontiers of Azerbaijan and Baghdad.

In 1722 Isfahan was besieged by Mahmud of Kandahar, and Shah Husain formally resigned his crown; though his son Tamasp assumed the title of King and implored the assistance of Peter the Great. The Czar captured Darband and Baku and concluded a treaty with Tamasp, who ceded all the Persian possessions on the Caspian Sea on condition that the Czar expelled the Afghans and placed him on the throne. Tamasp also entered into negotiations with the Turks, with the same object; but, regardless of his pretensions, Russia in 1724 avoided war with Turkey by agreeing to the cession to her of certain Persian provin ces : and in 1725 Turkey and Russia concluded a treaty by which they partitioned Persia among themselves. Mahmud died in 1725 and was succeeded by his cousin Ashraf. In 1727 Turkey, though defeated by Ashraf, forced him to cede § the Persian provinces which she had occupied, and in return acknowledged him as Shah. In the same j'ear Nadir Kuli Khan was placed in command of Tamasp’s army : and in 1780 the Afghans were expelled, Ashraf was killed, and Shah Tamasp was restored. He died in 1732 and was suc ceeded by his infant son Abbas III, who died three or four years later, when the Safavian dynasty came to an end and Nadir Kuli Khan ascend ed the throne with the title of Nadir Shah. Russia restored to Persia, by treaty, in 1729 the provinces of Astara- bad and Mazanderan: in 1732 (Treaty of Rasht) Larijan, Gilan and the Persian provinces as far as the Araxes: and in 1735 (Treaty of Gandja) Baku and Harband with their provinces, and retired behind the river Terek .^1 Under Nadir Shah the Persian empire recovered for a time its former glory.

In 1736, as a result of Nadir Shah’s victories, a treaty* was con cluded between Turkey and Persia, by which the frontiers were delimited anew. In 1746 a further treatyt of peace was concluded between Turkey and Persia fixing the limits of the two countries on the basis of the treaty of 1639, and this was followed in 1747 by another treaty^ under which certain parts of Iraq and Azerbaijan were ceded to Turkey. Nadir Shah was murdered in 1747 : and within a few years the mighty empire which he had re-created was dismembered. Ahmad Shah Abdali proclaimed himself King of the Afghans, took Kandahar and Herat, and laid the foundation of an empire which he extended by conquests more brilliant even than those of Nadir Shah. All that was left to Shah Rukh, the blinded grandson of Nadir Shah, was the province of Khorasan. This w as guaranteed in his independent possession by Ahmad Shah, but was soon broken up into a number of independent principali ties. The southern and western provinces of Ear, Ears, Iraq, Azerbai jan and Mazanderan were subdued by Karim Khan of the tribe of Zand, and a prince of the Safavian house named Shah Ismail, a son of the sister of Shah Husain, w-as set up as king. He was, however, a mere puppet, and was at last cast into prison, while the reins of government were held by Karim Khan alone. Karim Khan, who was a just and enlightened ruler, w r as at pains to extend and encourage commerce. The English, who had with difficulty maintained their factory at Gamrun till 1761, abandoned it in that year in consequence of the oppression of the pro vincial Governor of Ear. In 1763 they obtained from Karim Khan a Farman (No. I) for a factory at Bushire and the trade of the Persian Gulf, and from-his nephew Jafar Khan in 1788 a Farman (No. II) for unrestricted trade throughout Persia. Karim Khan died in 1779 after a vigorous rule of tw r enty-six years. His death was the signal for fresh revolutions marked by atrocious cruel ties, in the course of which the four surviving sons of Karim Khan were savagely mutilated. At length in 1795 Agha Muhammad Khan of the Qajar tribe ascended the throne. He was scarcely established in power when he found himself involved in a war with Russia over Georgia which, taking advantage of the distracted state of Persia, had in 1783 * Appendix No. II. t Appendix No. III. X Appendix No. IVPERSIA. 6 transferred its allegiance to Catherine II. Kesolved to punish the Georgians for their defection, he marched upon the country in 1795 with a rapidity which prevented them from receiving support from Russia, and ordered a general massacre of the inhabitants, sparing the young and beautiful, who were carried into captivity. Persia was instantly invaded by a Russian army. It soon gained important successes and was advancing on Tehran, when its progress was stopped by the death of the Empress in 1796. In 1796 the French Republic sent a mission to establish commercial relations and unite Persia with the Porte against Russia. The mission failed. In 1797 Agha Muhammad Khan, one of the most prudent and able kings who e\er ruled in Persia, was murdered. He was succeeded b} his nephew, Fateh Ali Khan. During his reign began that closer con nection between the British Government and Persia which had its origins m the fear of an Afghan invasion of India, the designs of the French on the British dominions in the East, and the competition of European powers for influence at Tehran. From the success which attended the invasions of India by Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali, it was believed that the plains of India were exposed to the ravaging of any ambitious ruler in Afghanistan. In 1796 Zaman Shah, grandson of Ahmad Shah Abdali, advanced to Lahore with the professed purpose of restoring the house of Timur from the domination of the Mahrattas Disturbances in his own dominions re called him in 1797; but his invasion and rumours of his renewed prepara tions, coupled with the apprehension of an invasion of India by the T rench and the deputation of a secret embassy by Napoleon to establish his influence at Tehran, forced the British Government to take measures foi the security of their Indian possessions. Captain Malcolm was accord ingly deputed as Envoy to Persia to negotiate a political and commer cial alliance. He concluded two treaties in 1801. By the terms of the Political Treaty (No. Ill) the Shah engaged to lay waste the country of the Afghans should they invade India, and to prevent the French fiom settling or residing in Persia; while, in the event of war between the Afghans or the French and Persia, the English were to assist the Shah with military stores. By the Commercial Treaty (No. IV) all privileges of the old factories were restored, several more were granted, and the duties to be collected from purchasers of staples were reduced to one per cent. In 1805, during the war between Persia and Russia wFich originated in the invasion of Georgia, the Shah, having suffered severe reverses and being threatened with the vengeance of Russia for the treacherous murder of the Russian General, threw himself on the support ofPERSIA. G Napoleon, then at the height of his power, and made overtures for a union of political interests with France. In 1806 Napoleon sent Monsieur Taubert to conclude a commercial treaty, afterwards ratified at Finkenstein. He was followed by General Gardanne’s mission, the object of which was to secure an offensive and defensive alliance. The Shah bitterly resented the interpretation which the British Government put upon the Treaty of 1801 and their refusal to give him assistance against Russia, in consideration of which he had offered to relinquish the French alliance. The proposals of the French were that they should compel the Russians to restore the province wrested from Persia, and furnish the Shah with military stores and officers to organize his army on the European system; while the Shah on his part was to declare immediate war on the English, to invade India by way of Afghan istan, and to permit a French army to invade India through his territories. These negotiations, frustrated by the peace concluded at Tilsit between Napoleon and the Czar Alexander, had the effect of rousing the British Government to efforts for the recovery of their lost ascendancy at the Court of Tehran and the protection of their Indian empire by binding the western frontier States in a chain of friendly alliances. Missions were sent by the Indian Government to the Mirs of Sind, Ranjit Singh, and the Court of Kabul, and Sir John Malcolm was again accredited as Envoy to Persia. Unfortunately, without pre vious concert with the Indian Government, and in ignorance of the measures concerted by them, Sir Harford Jones was at the same time deputed direct from England as Plenipotentiary on the part of the Crown. This led to unseemly complications which had the effect of rendering both governments ridiculous in the eyes of the Persians. Sir John Malcolm was instructed, in the event of Sir Harford Jones arriving at Bombay, on his way to Persia, before him, to proceed as Envoy to Baghdad for the purpose of establishing an alliance with the Pasha and the petty Chiefs in Arabia, leaving Sir Harford to conduct the negotiations at Tehran; but the paramount importance of recovering a footing in Persia was to overrule all other considerations, and Sir John was to proceed on his mission to Persia without delay if he should find himself the first in the field. Sir John arrived in Persia first, while the Shah was still trusting to the liberal promises with which the French amused him. Considering the dignity of the British Government insulted by an attempt, which he attributed to the influence of the Fiench embassy, to exclude him from the Royal presence and draw him into negotiations with subordinate officials at Shiraz, Sir John concluded that there was no hope of a friendly alliance. He therefore abruptly quitted the country, proceeded to Calcutta and induced Lord Mint© toPERSIA. 7 prepare for the occupation of the island of Karak in the Persian Gulf, as a position from which the British Government could either negotiate v ith dignity, 01 act with effect if war should he declared. The instruc tions given to Sir Harford Jones were that he should remain at Bombay till the issue of Sir John Malcolm’s mission was known; but that he should proceed to Persia at once in the event of Sir John either being obliged to lea^e without attaining' his object, or succeeding in concluding a preliminary treaty. On Sir John Malcolm’s return, therefore, he set out for Tehran. Further instructions to suspend his mission reached him too late. He arrived at Tehran when the Shah had lost all faith in the professions of the French, which, in consequence of the peace with Russia and reverses in Europe, they were no longer able to fulfil, and he there fore found no difficulty in concluding a preliminary Treaty (No. V). By this treaty, concluded in March 1809, all treaties contracted by the Shah with European powers were annulled ; he engaged to prevent the passage of European armies through his dominions towards India; and the English w ere to assist him with troops or a subsidy if any European forces should invade his territories, and to take no part, except as media tors, in any war between Persia and Afghanistan. The validity of this treaty, subject to such modifications as might afterwards be agreed upon, was recognized by Lord Minto; who, however, suspended the functions of Sir H. Jones, directed him to with draw fiom 1 ersia, and again sent Sir John Malcolm as Envoy to the Shah for the purpose of concerting further arrangements. Meanwhile Sir H. Jones had received orders from England to remain at Tehran till the arrival of another Plenipotentiary, Sir Gore Ouseley, whose powers superseded those of both Sir H. Jones and Sir J. Malcolm. A definitive Treaty 1 (Ho. \ I), based on the preliminary Treaty of 1809, was concluded by Sir Gore Ouseley in March 1812; but some of the stipulations were altered in England, and it was not till 1814 that the teims of the treaty were finally adjusted (Ho. VII). The preamble of this Ireaty of Adjustment provided for the subsequent conclusion of a commercial treaty: and the British representatives, Messrs. Ellis and Moriei, addressed an official note to the Shah proposing that commerce should remain on the footing of the Commercial Treaty of 1801 (Ho. III). 1 his proposal was not accepted, the Persian Government maintaining that,the Commercial Treaty of 1801 had been abrogated by the Treaty of 1814: and no steps were taken to conclude a new one. The only security enjoyed by British merchants in Persia was that afforded by the general friendly relations of Great Britain with Persia : except a Farman of 1824 (Ho. VIII) abolishing export duty on horses, and another of This treaty, although never formally ratified by His Majesty’s Government js inserted in this collection because it is referred to in the Treaty of 1814, and the seope of the latter treaty cannot be fully understood without comparison with it.msm ■■■■■BBHnnBH PERSIA. 1836 (No. X) permitting them to trade on payment of the same duties as Russian merchants. Throughout the long reign of Fateh Ali Shah the Persian Empire enjoyed rest from internal revolution, but suffered severely from pro tracted war with Russia. Georgia, Mingrelia, Daghistan, Shirwan, Karabagh and Talish were successively severed from it; and only the good offices of the British Government arrested the further advance of the Russian arms. In October 1813 peace was concluded at Gulistan, and a Treaty* was drawn up, indicating generally the boundary between the Russian and Persian empires, but leaving its exact direction to be settled by commissioners. In 1823 an Agreementf (Treaty of Erzerum) was concluded between Persia and Turkey, confirming the Treaty of 1746 (Appendix No. Ill) and adding fresh articles regarding commerce, pilgrims and nomad tribes. For some years after the conclusion of the Treaty of Gulistan, there was nominal peace between Persia and Russia; but many difficulties and disputes arose in the adjustment of the boundary. The Russians occu pied and refused to evacuate the district of Gokcha, which the Persians claimed as theirs. Hostilities were renewed in 1826, the first attack being made by Abbas Mirza, the Prince Royal of Persia, and the Persians claim ed from the British Government the assistance in money or troops stipula ted for in the 4th article of the Definitive Treaty of 1814. After enquiry, however, assistance was refused, on the ground that actual hostilities had been provoked by aggression on the part of Persia, but for which the dis pute might have been adjusted by negotiation—a decision of course un satisfactory to the Shah, who argued that the Russian occupation of Gokcha was an aggression on his dominions. In the course of the war the Persians sustained severe losses; but at length, through the mediation of the British Envoy, a treatyj of peace was concluded at Turkmanchai in February 1828, by which the Persian Government ceded to Russia the provinces of Erivan and Nakshivan, and agreed to pay an indemnity for the expenses of the war. On the conclusion of the negotiations, opportunity was taken by the British Envoy to purchase the abrogation (No. IX) of the 3rd and 4th articles of the Treaty of 1814, by a payment of 200,000 tomans, or one year’s subsidy. These articles had been found exceedingly onerous and inconvenient, and productive only of collision with the Persian Govern ment. By the cancelling of the 3rd and 4th articles, the 6th and 7th articles also were virtually abrogaled. * Appendix No. V. t Appendix No. VI. I Appendix No. VTT,PERSIA. 9 After the pacification of Europe in 1815, and the removal of those dangers which had given exaggerated importance to the Persian alliance, no steps were taken to maintain the influence in Persian counsels which had been secured to the British Government by the Treaty of Tehran in 1814. On the contrary, much w^as done to dishearten the Shah and impress him with the belief that the preservation of the integrity of his Empire was a matter of indifference to England. Not the least distaste ful part of the change in policy was the transfer, in 1823, of the relations with Persia to the Government of India, and the substitution of an envoy of the Governor-General for the plenipotentiary of the Crown. This change was accepted most reluctantly by the Shah, who considered it not only derogatory to his dignity, but dangerous to his power. The conflict between the Crown and the Indian Government regarding the mission in 1809 had lowered his respect for the latter; and he believed, moreover, that the operations, which the Indian Government undertook in 1819 against the pirates in the Persian Gulf, would have ended in aggressions on his government but for the control of the English ministry. So little care was taken to cultivate relations with Persia after the peace of Turkmanchai and the abrogation of the subsidy agreement of 1814, to which the Shah agreed only under the pressure of pecuniary embarrass ments caused by the payment of the indemnity to Russia, that the in fluence of the British Government at Tehran declined before that of Russia. For some years the Shah continued to urge the necessity of revising the Treaty of 1814 and of substituting for the abrogated articles a general stipulation of protection, which would at least evidence the wish of the British Government that the independence of Persia should be preserved. No steps, however, were taken to meet his expectations; and when, after long delay, the British Government in 1833 authorised their representative in Persia to enter on negotiations for a revision of the treaty, their ascendancy had given place to that of Russia. The negotiations were protracted till 1837, but led to no result. Fateh Ali Shah died in 1834. By the influence of Russia and Eng land, his grandson Muhammad Shah v r as placed on the throne, notwith standing the opposition of many princes of the blood royal. In the same year an understanding, subsequently acknowledged to be in force by interchange of notes in 1838, 1873 and 1874, was arrived at by Great Britain and Russia, with regard to the maintenance of the integrity and independence of Persia. In 1836 Persia found herself unable to repress the Turkman raiders in the province of Astarabad, who made constant descents by sea on the Persian shores. By the Treaty of Gulistan (Appendix No. V) she had renounced all right to have ships of war on the Caspian Sea, and she w-as compelled to beg for the help of Russian ships to put down the marauders. Once, however, in possession of the Island of Cherken, whence she couldIQ PERSIA. check the raiders, she notified the Russian Government that their help was no longer required. A Russian squadron was nevertheless sent in 1842 to the Island of Ashurada, occupied by the Russians in 1838, and a naval station was built there to overawe the Turkmans. In 1921 the Russians renounced their claim to this island under Article 3 of the Treaty* concluded with Persia in that year. The reconquest of Afghanistan had always been a favourite dream of the Qajar dynasty, who conceived that their rights of sovereignty over it were as complete as in the days of the Safavian kings. The first use which the Russians made of their ascendancy after the peace of 1828 was to encourage Fateh Ali Shah in his ambition for eastern conquests, as an off-set for the cessions on his north-western frontier and as an indirect means of establishing their own influence as far as the Indus. Fateh Ali Shah projected two unsuccessful expeditions against Afghanistan. Muhammad Shah, ever a friend of Russia and an enemy to British interests, revived the project and with a large force laid siege to Herat in November 1837. He had been warned that any hostile movement against Herat would be viewed with dissatisfaction by tlie British Gov ernment. Confident, however, in the support of Russia, he rejected all offers for the settlement of his disputes with Shall Kamran of Herat by friendly mediation, and treated the British mission with such marked discourtesy, that the Envoy lowered his flag and declared the alliance with Persia at an end. To force the Shah to renounce his ambitious pro jects, a demonstration was made in the Persian Gulf by the occupation of the Island of Karak. This had the effect of forcing him to withdraw his troops from Herat after a memorable siege of ten months, in which all his efforts to take the city were defeated by the energy and ability of Eldred Pottinger, a young English officer of artillery. On the with drawal of the British armies from Afghanistan, Shah Kamran was deposed and murdered by his minister, Yar Muhammad Khan, who in words professed himself to be a dependent of the Shah of Persia, but maintained himself in real independence. In 1839 a Farman (No. XI) Avas procured from the Shah guaranteeing protection to Mission servants. This had been rendered necessary by the arrest and search of a Legation messenger travelling between Herat and the Shah’s camp. This farman was supplemented by another (No. XII) for the same purpose in the following year. The unsatisfactory conditions of British trade in Persia AA^ere at last remedied in 1841 by the conclusion of a Commercial Treaty (No. XIII) which put the trade of Great Britain and Persia on most favoured nation footing, and provided for the establishment of commercial agencies in the two countries. In 1844 a Farman (No. XIV) prescribed the procedure * Appendix No. XXV.PERSIA. 11 to be followed for the protection of merchants in cases of bankruptcy and insolvency. In 1842 Persia concluded a “ perpetual ” treaty with Spain*, under which Spanish subjects were granted certain extra-territorial privileges. In 1844 a convention t was signed between Russia and Persia, ex plaining the 14th article of the Treaty of Turkmanchai, and decreeing that the subjects of either State crossing the frontier into the territory of the other must be provided with passports. In 1845 French merchandise was put on most favoured nation footing. In 1847 a commercial treaty with France was signed, but in 1849 the Persian Grovernment formally refused to ratify it. In 1847 the Persian and Turkish Governments entered into Articles of Agreement^ confirming the Treaty of Erzerum (Appendix No. \ I) and undertaking to appoint Commissioners to demarcate the boundary. Muhammad Shah died in 1848 and was succeeded by his eldest son Nasir-ud-Din. In 1848 a Russian hospital for the use of Russians employed in checking the marauding Turkmans was established by a Royal Farman at Bandar-i-Gaz on the Persian mainland in the province of Astarabad. In the same year the British Government, who were making strenuous exertions to suppress the traffic in African slaves, secured an Engage ment (No. XY) from the Shah to prohibit the import of slaves into Persia by sea. So great was the opposition of the priests to the abolition of the slave traffic, that the Shah did not feel himself strong enough to prohibit the import of slaves into his dominions absolutely; but, as the route by land was not practicable, he virtually did so by forbidding import by sea. In 1851 a Convention (No. XYI) was concluded for the search and seizure of Persian vessels suspected of being engaged in the slave trade. Yar Muhammad Khan of Herat died in 1851, and was succeeded by his son Saiyid Muhammad Khan. Feeling himself insecure in powder and threatened by the Amir of Kabul and by Kohahdil Khan from Kandahar, Saiyid Muhammad Khan made overtures to Persia: and a force was despatched by the Shah nominally to reduce the Turkmans but in reality to occupy Herat. The British Envoy at Tehran remonstrated and required from the Persian Government explicit assurances of the course they meant to adopt. In January 1853 the Persian Government signed an Agreement (No. XYII) not to send troops to Herat unless it should be attacked by a foreign force, and not to interfere further in its * Appendix No. VIII. t Appendix No. IX. | Appendix No. N*■HBBBHHBHHHai 12 PERSIA. affairs tlian had been done in the lifetime of Yar Muhammad. This interference with their ambitious projects greatly irritated the Persian Court, who showed their annoyance by a series of vexatious slights which eventually led to a rupture. In 1854 Mirza Hashim Khan, who had been discharged from the Shah’s service, was appointed to be agent at Shiraz for the British mission. The Persian Government objected to the appointment, and threatened to imprison him if he took up the post. They next seized and imprisoned his wife. As all redress was persistently refused, the Envoy at Tehran struck his flag on the 20th November and withdrew. An official notification was issued by the Persian Govern ment justifying their proceedings, and making certain insinuations against the British Envoy. In the meantime Muhammad Yusuf, grandson of Firoz, one of the brothers of Shah Shuja, had put Saiyid Muhammad Khan to death, and had applied to the Shah of Persia for assistance. A force was sent in December 1855, in violation of the agreement which had been made by the Persian Government. Muham mad 1 usuf was taken prisoner, and Herat was captured on the 26th October 1856. Every effort having failed to induce the Persian Govern ment to adjust the quarrel and to apologize for the insults to the British mission, a force was despatched from Bombay to occupy the Island of Karak, and war was formally declared on the 1st November 1856. After a brief campaign hostilities were terminated by the Treaty of Paris (No. XT III) concluded on the 4th March 1857. This treaty revived none of the earlier treaties cancelled by the war except the Convention of August 1851 for the suppression of slavery in the Persian Gulf, which by the 13th article was renewed till August 1872. The Legation at Tehran was under the immediate direction of the India Office from 1823 to 1835, and again for one vear from the end of 1858 to the end of 1859.* Since then it has remained under the control of the British Foreign Office. During the Crimean War in 1854 Persia remained neutral, although she was at one time on the point of casting in her lot with Russia, as a return for which territorial aggrandizement was offered her, as well as release from the payment of the subsidy which she had to make to Russia in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Turkmanchai. She stood aloof, however, although at one time Persian troops were massed on the Turkish frontier. In 1855 I ersia concluded a &lt;c perpetual ” treatv of friendship and commerce with France l, under which special extra-territorial privileges were granted to French subjects in Persia. rti**TW° rdl Tir t; ° Rawll ?

Com- pamts of the passage of nomad tribes to and from the-Pashalik of Baghdad, and of the grant of an asylum to marauders and refugees by the frontier authorities, led to the insertion of articles in the Treaty of Erzerum of 1823 (Appendix No. VI) providing for the remedy of these abuses. These provisions proved ineffectual, and in 1849 four commis sioners were appointed on the part of England, Russia, Persia and turkey respectively, for the purpose of defining the border as provided m the second and third of the Articles of Agreement signed at Erzerum m 1847 (Appendix No. X). A map of the border districts was prepared fiv the commission, but the actual demarcation was not effected, and the question remained in abeyance. In 1869 a protocol* was signed by the Persian and Turkish representatives on the simultaneous presentation by the representatives of England and Russia at Constantinople and Tehran, of a map which had been drawn up by the English and Russian commissioners. On this map a band of territory varying from 25 to 40 miles wide was laid down, within which the mediatory powers declared that they considered the frontier line ought to be found. Under this piotocol the status quo of the lands in dispute, which were situated on the aonth-western slope of the Pusht-i-Koh range, near the Tigris, was to be maintained until the boundary line should be settled, and no buildings were to be erected on these lands. In 1869, the Russians having firmly established themselves at Kras- novodsk on the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea, it was found necessary to define the frontier between Russia and Persia; and accordingly an agreementf was drawn up secretly and acknowledged by an autograph letter of the Shah fixing the river Atrak as the boundary between the two States. The Persian Government later declared that the Atrak frontier only referred to the seaboard and to about 50 miles inland, and did not include the river to its source. * Appendix No. XII. t Appendix No. XIII.PERSIA. The proceedings of the Persian authorities on the frontier of Balu chistan were long a source of anxiety to the Khan of Kalat. Founding her pretensions to dominion in Baluchistan on the conquests of foimei dynasties, Persia gradually advanced beyond the frontier which marked her possessions early in the nineteenth century, and justified her action by the necessity of repressing the border Baluchis, who were in the habit of organizing marauding expeditions into the neighbouring province of Kerman. In this way the district of Bampur fell into the hands of the Persians in 1841 ; and nine years later, after the unsuccessful revolt of its Chief, it was permanently occupied by them. Subsequently the Chiefs of the western divisions of Makran, viz., Dizak, Sarbaz, (xeh and Kasarkand, paid tribute to Ibrahim Khan, the Persian Governor of Bampur. No opportunity was lost by Ibrahim Khan of asserting the claim of Persia, and his proceedings during the construction of the telegraph from Bushire to Gwattur in 1863, addressing threatening letters to the neighbouring Chiefs, formed the subject of reference to Tehran. Five years later he manifested a disposition to interfere with the construction of the telegraph between Task and Gwattur, and the threatening attitude adopted by him during that and the following year towards Kech and other parts of Makran owing allegiance to the Khan of Kalat was productive of much excitement and disturbance in the border districts. The ministers of the Shah disclaimed any intention of assertino 1 the claims of Persia to Kech bv force of arms; but the British Government, having treaty engagements with the Khan of Kalat, could not view wfith indifference any intentions on the part of Persia which caused apprehension to the Khan, and the expediency of forbidding either open aggression or threats on the part of the frontier authorities was impressed on the ministers. A proposal was then made in 1870 by the Shah that, as the boundaries between Persia and Kalat had not been clearly defined, if the British Government desired that the line of frontier should be traced, commis sioners should he sent to the frontier by England, Persia and Kalat for the purpose of settling the boundary. This proposal was accepted by the British Government; and in January 1871 the commissioners met on the frontier and, after collecting all the available information, Major-General Goldsmid, the British commissioner, proceeded to Tehran for the adjust ment of the question. The Persian frontier, as defined in a memorandum by the British commissioner, and comprising Dizak and Bampusht, Sarbaz and Pishin, Baho and Dashtiyari, was accepted by the Shah in September 1871. A request was subsequently preferred by the Persian Government that the small district of Kuhak, lying below the Talk and Kalagan sub-divisions of the Dizak district, which had been included on the map within the Kalat frontier, might be made over to Persia. This was so far agreed to bv the British Government that the line forming thePERSIA. 15 western boundary of Kalat was drawn to tbe east of Kuhak; but no opinion was expressed as to the position of tbe Persian frontier. Kuhak was occupied by Persian troops in May 1874. [See Baluchistan, Yol. XI.) In 1870 a convention* was come to between Turkey and Persia with reference to the transportation of corpses to the sacred places in Mesopo tamia. A period of three years was fixed as the limit to the delay in transport. In 1871 the border disputes between Persia and Turkey were revived, negotiations ensued, and finally it was arranged that refugees on the border should be removed to such a distance in the interior of each State as should prevent their carrying on intrigues. It was also agreed that a Perso-Turkish commission should assemble at Constantinople for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Articles of Agree ment signed at Erzerum in 1847 (Appendix Xo. X): and that delegates on the part of England and Russia should be present to assist those of Persia and Turkey in coming to a complete understanding; but owing 1 to the dilatoriness of the Porte the commission never met. In 1873 Persia concluded a commercial treatyt with Germany, and in 1875 two conventions with Turkey: the first+ having reference to the import of salt and tobacco, and tbe second § regulating the position of the subjects of the twm powers in their respective States. In 1876 troubles were renewed on the Turko-Persian frontier at Khoi and Zohab, which were claimed both by Turkey and Persia ; they con tinued in the following year and resulted in the presentation by the Persian Government of their grievances against the Porte, which were: — first, the continued occupation by Turkey of Kotaur (Kutur), seized by Darvesh Pasha in 1849 when on his way to join the frontier commission at Baghdad, and, in spite of the repeated protests of the Persian Govern ment, still held by the Porte, and also of Banzargan, Deiri, Mahmudi, Akhorak, Chibaktu and Khazina; second, the ill-treatment to which Persian pilgrims were subjected; third, the non-execution of the promise made that Abbas Mirza should be removed from Baghdad ; and fourth, the delay in delimiting the frontier. In the same year the island of Shahleh in the Persian Gulf, claimed by Persia, was occupied by Turkey, but evacuated on an agreement being entered into by the Persian Government that it should not be cultivated or occupied by Persian troops pending the final settlement of the respective claims to it. * Concluded at Baghdad and signed by Midhat Pasha, Governor-General of Baghdad, and Mushir-ud-Daula Mirza Hussain Khan, Persian Ambassador at Constantinople. t Appendix No. XIV. + Appendix No. XV. S Appendix No. XVI.16 PERSIA. In 1878 Persia and Turkey settled a special tobacco tariff * renewable every ten years: and signed an agreement t respecting sanitary regula tions to be observed by Persian pilgrims. In 1877 the continued advance of the Russian troops on the east coast of the Caspian Sea caused the Turkmans of Merv and Akhal to consider whether it would be for their advantage that the nominal sovereignty, which Persia had claimed over them for many years, should become more definite, or whether it would be more prudent to declare allegiance to Russia. In 1878 some Chiefs of the Tekke Turkmans of Merv visited Tehran and made an agreement with the Shah, by w r hich they promised allegiance to Persia; but the agreement was set aside on their return to Merv. In the same year the Russians advanced on the Akhal territory formerly claimed by Persia, and continued their advance in the following- year. In 1880 the Tekke Turkmans of Merv again sent a deputation to Tehran; but this led to no result, as one of the conditions of their admitting allegiance to Persia was that the fertile lands of Sarakhs should be assigned to them if they eventually decided to abandon Merv. In the meanwhile the Turkmans of the Akhal district had gained tem porary successes against the Russians; but in 1881 General Skobeleff took Geok lapih and occupied the Persian Ataks of Daraghaz and Kalat-i- Nadiri. This led to the signing of the Akhal-Khorasan boundary convention^ by which the Russo-Persian frontier from the Caspian Sea to Baba Durmaz was defined, although the actual demarcation by the Russian and Persian commissioners was not completed till 1885. By the Convention of 1881 the agreement entered into in 1869, by which the river Atrak -was to form the boundary between the two countries, was cancelled. In 1880 a protocol was signed between Great Britain and Russia regarding the territory of Kotaur, in accordance with the 60th article of the Treaty of Berlin, by which the lands in dispute were declared to belong to Persia and were therefore evacuated by the Turkish troops. In the same year a Kurdish tribe, under a certain Shaikh Obaidulla, made an incursion over the Turko-Persian frontier and ravaged certain eisian \illages. In 1881-82, on the Persian Government making urgent representations to the Porte, measures were taken to prevent the recur rence of these inroads, and the Shaikh was captured and banished to Medina. In 1882 a second slave-trade Convention (No. XIX) was signed between Great Britain and Persia, abrogating the Convention of 1851, giving British cruisers the right to search Persian vessels, and making * Appendix No. XVII. t Appendix No. XVIII. 7 Appendix No. XIX.PERSIA. 17 arrangements respecting the disposal of slaves found and the punish ment of the slavers. In 1882 the Russian Minister at Tehran informed the Persian Govern ment that, as Persia had not asserted her sovereignty over the Tekke Turkmans of Merv, the Russian Government could not now recognize such sovereignty. The Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs replied thai Persia, although she could not consider her territorial rights over Merv as invalidated by the reasons given, would nevertheless not take any action with respect to the allegiance of the Tekkes without consulting Russia; and it subsequently transpired that the Russians had already, in the autumn of 1881, concluded an agreement with the Tekkes of Merv b} which mutual protection was guaranteed to the subjects of both parties, and Russian agents, to the exclusion of all others, were alone to be received at Merv. In 1884 Merv surrendered to the Russians, who then occupied Sarakhs on the giound that it had always belonged to the Tekke Turkmans of Merv. In the same year representations were made by the Porte that, in violation of the protocol of 1869, an armed Persian force of 500 horsemen had entered and sown the disputed district. 1 he I ersians still maintained that the lands were undoubtedly on the Persian side of the frontier as determined by the Erzerum Agreement of 184&lt;, which fixed the status quo in certain districts. The district was then occupied by Turkish troops; whereupon a joint note was addressed by the English and Russian Legations at Tehran to the Turkish and Persian Governments, asking that the troops might evacuate the district, and that a map shewing the frontier might be prepared together with a memorandum explaining the pretensions of Persia. In May 1889 the Persian Government complained of a Turkish attack on the village of Kadkhoda Ali, in the district of Khanikin, to which the Turkish Ambassador at Tehran replied by complaining of the occu pation by Persians of lands at Vazneh on the Turko-Persian frontier, which he declared to be undoubtedly Turkish. Persia proposed the appointment of two engineers to decide as to the proprietary rights to \ azneh, but to this the Turkish Government did not agree. In July of the same year a Kurdish inroad took place at Abagir in the district of Urumia, which was equally claimed by both Governments. In January 1890 the Turkish Government stipulated that, before any agreement should be discussed respecting Vazneh, the lands in dispute should be evacuated by the Persians. In April a protocol was drawn up by the Persian (xovernment and submitted to the Porte for the settlement ol the question, by which Persia agreed to evacuate the district pending the decision. The frontier in the Khanikin district is now (1930) that demarcated by the 1913 Frontier Commission. In 1888 the New Oriental Bank Corporation opened branches at Tehran and in other Persian towns.18 PERSIA. In the same year the Shnh issued a proclamation* promising* protec tion of their property to all his subjects: and the Persian Government announced, in a circular t, the opening* of the Karun River to the merchant shipping of all nations. In 1885 the cultivation by Persians of certain lands at Hashtadan on the Hari Rud frontier led to a protest from the Government of Afghanistan, the Amir claiming the lands in question as part of his dominions. The British Government offered (by virtue of the Gth article of the Treaty of Paris of 1857) to act as arbitrator between the two countries in the question at issue. The offer was accepted and General MacLean was deputed to act as arbitrator. In 1888 he proposed an arrangement^ for the settlement of the disputed frontier, which was accepted by the two Governments. The demarcation was completed in 1891. In 1889 the Persian Government at length agreed to the appointment of foreign Consuls at Meshed, and the Russian and British Governments at once named Consuls-General there. In 1890, owing to the rivalry existing between the British and Russian Governments regarding railways, the Shah made an agreement § with the Russian Government that no railways should be built in Persia during the next ten years. Nasir-ud-Din Shah was murdered in 1896, and was succeeded by his second son Muzaffar-ud-Din. In 1901 Persia concluded a commercial treatyll with Russia, by' which a detailed tariff was substituted for the flat rate of 5 per cent, that had been in force since 1828, under Article 3 of the Separate Compact annexed to the Treaty of Turkmanchai (Appendix J7o. VII). In 1903 Persia concluded a Commercial Convention (No. XX) with Great Britain. This also included a detailed tariff. In 190G Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah granted a Constitution. lie died in 1907 and w r as succeeded by his son Mohammed Ali Shah who in 1909 was succeeded by his infant son, Ahmed Mirza. On the 31st August 1907. the British and Russian Governments signed a Convention (No. XXI) which, while affirming the independence and integrity of Persia, divided the country into three “ zones of influence ”—a Russian zone in the North, a British zone in the South, and a neutral zone in the centre; and on the 11th September a Joint Note (No. XXII) was address ed to the Persian Government by the British and Russian Legations, informing them of the conclusion of the Convention. * Appendix No. XX. t Appendix No. XXI. I Appendix No. XXII. § Appendix No. XXIII. 1i Appendix No. XXIV.Persia. 19 r '&gt;5 In 1913 a Protocol (No. XXIII) relating to the Turco-Persian frontier was signed by the representatives of Great Britain, Russia, Persia arid Turkey: and in 1914 the frontier was delimited by a com mission which included representatives of the four countries. The com mission completed its proceedings shortly before the entry of Tur key into the Great War. Since the War, however, the Turks have occupied a strip of territory on the Persian north-west frontier which the Persians claim under the ruling of the Frontier Commission. An Agreement providing for the appointment of a mixed Commission to revise on the spot the frontier at Kotaur and certain other disputed points; and for the establishment of a Permanent Mixed Frontier Com mission, and general collaboration between the respective frontier officials was signed on 9th April 1929; but the actual delimitation of the frontier at the points in dispute is still unfinished (1930). The Anglo-Russian Convention had caused great resentment through out the country: and the outbreak of the Great War found Persia in a hostile mood towards both Russia and Great Britain. This feeling was intensified when, in order to forestall a Russian plan to make Northern Persia a base of operations against Turkey, Turkish forces were obliged to violate Persian neutrality. By the beginning of 1915 the Turkish troops had reached Tabriz and devastated the rich districts around TJrumia. Increasing unrest and anarchy followed throughout the country, where German and Austrian influences were soon at work. In July 1915 Herr Wassmuss was able to organise a tribal attack on Bushire, necessitating its occupation by British troops. The Allied Consuls and colonies were forced to evacuate Kermanshah in April 1915, and Isfahan in September 1915 : and the situation in the Capital itself was only re trieved by the landing of a large Russian force at Enzeli and their advance to within a few miles of Tehran. The Persian nationalists thereupon escaped to Rum, and it was with difficulty that the Shah was prevented from following them. Meanwhile the whole of Southern Per sia had risen in support of the Central Powers : and by the end of 1915 British Consuls and colonies remained only in Bushire and Southern Arabistan. In 191G the position was redeemed to some extent by the advance of Russian troops towards Kermanshah, and by the recruitment in the South of local levies which eventually became the South Persia Rifles. By 1917 the Russians had reached Isfahan, and the South Persia Rifles had occupied Shiraz. In March the fall of Baghdad caused the Turkish forces to melt away; but the ensuing revolution in Russia flung the whole responsibility for maintaining order in Persia upon the British forces. The situation was at the same time compli* cated by the creation of an organisation in Tehran under the title of “ The Committee of Punishment ”, and the consequent hesitation of any Anglophil politician to accept the dangers of office. By the end ofPERSIA. 20 1917, as a result of the Bolshevik revolution, all Russian troops were withdrawn, the Jangalis had risen in Gilan, and the Turks were again advancing on Tabriz. It was therefore decided early in 1918 to send a British force from Mesopotamia to protect Tehran, and this force suc cessively occupied Kermansliah, Hamadan, Kasvin, Reslit and Enzeli. Meanwhile, however, anti-British feeling had increased throughout the country: and it was only when the final victory in Palesxine and on the Western front had enabled Vossuq-ud-Dauleh to form a definitely friendly cabinet that some sort of order was restored. In 1919 Vossuq-ud-Dauleh concluded an Anglo-Persian Agreement (Vo. XXIV), under which Great Britain agreed to lend Persia expert advisers and to grant a loan of £2,000,000 for the execution of the neces sary reforms. Persian opinion was not at the moment unfavourable to this Agreement: and, had it at once been submitted to the Majlis, it would probably have been ratified. Unfortunately however Vossuq delayed until the forces of opposition were organised and the Bolsheviks and Jangalis had again occupied Gilan. In June 1920 Vossuq re signed and was succeeded by Mushir-ud-Dauleh, who also failed to present the Anglo-Persian Agreement to the Majlis. The withdrawal of British troops from Persia at the end of 1920 left the Persian Govern ment with no alternative but to come to terms with the Soviet. A Russo-Persian Treaty * was signed in February 1921. In the same month Reza Khan with 3,000 Cossacks entered Tehran fiom Kasvin. A Cabinet crisis ensued, increasing the prevailing un certainty : and the knowledge, that all British troops would be withdrawn as soon as the roads were open, finally eliminated all possibility of the Anglo-Persian Agreement being carried into effect. Mushir-ud-Dauleh resigned, and Zia-ud-Din, vdio had joined Reza Khan’s coup d’etat, was appointed Prime Minister. His first act was to denounce the Anglo- Persian Agreement and to arrest all supposed supporters of it; but his subsequent projects of reform quickly antagonised all vested interests, a nd in May 1921 he was forced to resign and to leave Persia. In 1920 Persia acceded to the Covenant of the League of Xations. ^ In the same year an Agreement (No. XXV) was concluded between Great Britain and Persia, modifying the Commercial Convention of 1903 (No. XX). In June 1921 a treaty t of friendship was concluded between Persia and Afghanistan. In December the Persian Foreign Minister and the Russian Plenipotentiary exchanged notes regarding the interpretation of cert am articles of the Treaty of February 1921 Appendix No. * Appendix No. XXV. t Appendix No. XXVI.PERSIA. 21 In 1922 an Agreement for the closing of foreign Post Offices in Persia was concluded between British India and Iraq on the one part and Persia on the other : and in accordance with Article 3 of this Agree ment two Subsidiary Agreements—one for the exchange of Money Orders and the other for the exchange of Value Payable Articles between Persia and British India—were also concluded with Persia. These three Agree ments were, however, never ratified. Ihe South Persia Rifles were disbanded in 1921, and no British officers or officials remained in Persia at the close of that year. Reza Khan (who had been given the title of Serdar Sepah) thereupon took up with great energy the reform of the army; and in 1923 assumed the office of Prime Minister and virtual dictator. In November 1923 Ahmed Shah, overshadowed by his powerful Prime Minister, left for Paris: and his departure at this critical period finally cost him his throne. Reza Khan’s foreign policy aimed at maintaining friendly relations with both Russia and Great Britain, while at the same time cultivating close relations with America and with the American Pinancial Mission to Persia, which, under the leadership of Doctor Millspaugh, had arrived m Tehran m the autumn of 1922. During the whole of 1924 Reza Khan retained the office of Prime Minister, and Ahmed Shah remained iif aris. In the spring Reza Khan organised a republican movement; ut proved abortive, and this failure momentarily deprived him of his popularity and prestige. In the latter part of the summer, however, a signal opportunity was given him to recover his influence. The Shaikh of Mofiammerah defied the Central Government: and Reza Khan advanced upon Khuzistan, obtained the Shaikh’s submission, and granted him in return a free pardon. This pardon was subsequently repudiated, and the Shaikh was arrested and brought to Tehran, where he is still (December 1930) under detention. On his return from Khuzistan, Reza Khan was restored once more to his former position of dominance: and on the 31st October 1925 the Majlis voted the deposi tion of the Qajar dynasty and entrusted Reza Khan Pahlavi with the “ Headship of tl.e State ”. On the 12th December the Constituent Assembly met, and offered Reza Khan the throne of Persia: and he was crowned Shah on the 25th April 1926. In 1923 a Postal Convention* was concluded between Persia and Russia, in accordance with Article 21 of the Russo-Persian Treaty of February 1921 (Appendix No. XXV). In 1927 Persia concluded a treaty of Guarantee and Neutrality with Turkey.! In 1927 Persia concluded a treaty of Guarantee and Neutrality with Russia.^ * Appendix No. XXVII. t Appendix No. XXVIII. X Appendix No. XXIX.o6 PERSIA. In June 1928 Persia concluded two Protocols—one with Afghanistan* and the other with Turkey—as supplements to the Perso-Afghan reaty of 1927 and the Tureo-Persian Treaty of 192C, respectively, they pro vided that in the event of one of the contracting Parties being subjected to hostile action by one or more Powers the other would use all its efforts to solve the question at issue by peaceful means and that, if in spite o this, war was inevitable, both the contracting Parties would study the situation carefully in a spirit of cordiality, unanimity and good-will and evolve some solution in conformity with their interests and appropriate to the situation. In 1928 those foreign Powers who had formerly enjoyed extra ter ritorial jurisdiction agreed to abandon that right and to make fresh treaties with Persia on equal terms. Such treaties have already been made between Persia and Germany, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Belgium, Egypt, Sweden, France, Hejaz, Holland and Italy. Persia has also adhered to the Kellog Pact and to the Litvinoff Pact. In the same year a Tar ill Autonomy Treaty t (No. XX^ 1) vas con- plndpd hptween Great Britan and P( -i.cn n Persian Government promulgated a new customs tariff.+ In 1930 Persia acceded to the Optional Clause of the Statute of the negotiations with Persia for the conclusion of a general treaty to regulate the various questions outstanding between the tivo Governments and also of a Commercial Treaty, but no conclusion has so far been reached. In 1930 Persia acceded to the Optional Clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice with certain reservations contained in a Declaration^ made at the time of her accession to the Clause. * Afghanistan, Appendix No. XI] l. t Not yet ratified.^ X Appendix No. XXX. n The Imperial Government of Persia recognises as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation, that is to say on condition of reciprocity, the jurisdiction of the Perma nent Court of International Justice, in accordance with Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Statute of the Court, in any disputes arising after the ratification of the present declaration with regard to situations or facts relating directly or indirectly to the application of Treaties or Conventions accepted by Persia and subsequent to the ratification of this declaration, with the exception of : — (a) disputes relating to the territorial status of Persia, including those con cerning the rights of sovereignty of Persia over its Islands and Ports; (b) disputes in regard to which the Parties have agreed or shall agree to have recourse to some other method of peaceful settlement; (c) disputes with regard to questions which, by international law, fall ex clusively within the jurisdiction of Persia.

Geneva, October 2, 1930. HUSSEIN ALA.PEltSlA —foreign Concessions. .JtK L oreign Concessions in Persia .—-The first important concession was that for the Caspian Sea fisheries, first granted about 1867 to M. Lianozon, a llussian subject. J iie concession was frequently renewed, until the I ersian (Tovernnient cancelled it in 1919 on the ground of non payment of royalties during the latter part of the Great War. These fisheries were mentioned in the Perso-Kiissian Treaty of 1921, and formed the subject of negotiation during 1924 and 1925. The Russian Govern ment contended that, under the original concession, they had the right to exploit them, and they remained in physical occupation of them pending the result of the negotiations. In October 1927 the Persian Government ratified an agreement by which the Fisheries were to be exploited by a Russo-Persian association on a 50-50 basis. For the telegraph concession granted in 1868 to Messrs. Siemens (The Indo-European Telegraph Company) see the Telegraphs section, infra. Until 1919 the Company was under Russian protection, but came under Rritish protection in that year. Ihe famous Reuter Concession, which had been granted in 1872 and Cancelled in 1873, was remodelled and signed in January 1889 at Tehran. Baron Reuter was accorded the grant for a term of 60 years of the Im perial Bank of Persia, which was established under a British Royul Charter in September 1889. Among other concessions were the issue of bank notes which should be a legal tender; the service of the treasury; and the rights of mining for iron, copper, lead, mercury, coal, petroleum, borax and asbestos in all Persia. The Imperial Bank of Persia’s con cession was modified in May 1930, when the Bank ceded its right of note issue in. exchange for a lump sum of two hundred thousand pounds with effect from the 21st March 1931. The railway question, which had for some years been mooted in Persia, was brought prominently forward by the terms of the Reuter Concession of 1872, and since that time numerous concessions have been granted to European Companies and others; but in only two instances—one, the short line from Tehran to Shah Abdul Azim, a distance of six miles, which is worked by a Belgian Company, and which was granted in 1886; the other, the Amul railway in Mazanderan, which was granted to Jlajji Amini Zarb (Muhammad Hassan)—have these con cessions been taken up. After the conclusion of the Perso-Russian “ anti- railway Agreement of 1890 (Appendix JNh. XXIII) two minor railway concessions were granted in 1891, with the consent of the Russian and British Governments, to a Belgian and a French subject respectively; but both have since lapsed. A line from Julfa to Tabriz was constructed by a Russian Company in 1916 and eventually handed over by the Soviet Government under the terms of the 1921 Treaty: in the same year (1916) a concession was granted to a Russian Company for the construction of a line from Pireh-bazaar to Resht, which has since been♦24 PERSIA —Foreign Concessions. completed and opened to traffic. It was only after the War that the question of a trunk line was seriously taken in hand. In 1925 the Majlis authorised the Government to levy a so-called monopoly surcharge on sugar and tea imports, the proceeds of which, amounting to approximately six million tomans (&lt;£1,200,000) a year, have since been paid into a rail way fund. American railway experts were subsequently engaged, and in 1927 the Majlis passed a Bill for the construction of a railroad from Khor Musa or Mohammerah in the South to Bandar-i-Gaz in the jNorth by way of Hamadan and Tehran. It was at first intended that the Government should build this line on its own account; but contracts for the total survey and the construction of important sections of the rail road at either end were subsequently awarded to an American-German syndicate. Difficulties between the syndicate and the Persian Govern ment led in May 1930 to the cancellation of these contracts, but a fresh contract v T as granted later in the year for the completion of the IS'orthern Section of the line by the German group interested in the earlier contract. In 1890 the concession for a carriage road from Tehran to the south of Persia was purchased by the Imperial Bank of Persia: and in 1898 the Bank secured the concession for a road from Kum to Isfahan on the Same terms. The entire concession, which includes the construction and Avorking of the road from Tehran to Kum and Isfahan, and from the for mer to Ahwaz via Sultanabad, Dizful and Shuster, the extension of the latter from Ahwaz to Mohammerah, and the branch road from Burujird to Isfahan, was eventually transferred by the Bank to the Persian Trans port Company. In 1890 Lazar Poliakoff of Moscow obtained a concession for the establishment of a “ Transport and Insurance Company.” This Company acquired in 1892 the concession for the Knzeli-Kazvin road, and in 1894 that for the road from Kazvin to Hamadan. In 1897 the Companv purchased the Kazvin-Tehran road, which the Persian Government had constructed in 1880, and acquired a concession for the construction of a quay, piers, etc., at Enzeli. In 1902 the Russians acquired a concession for a road running from Julfa on the Russian frontier to Tabriz and link ing with Kazvin. In connection with this road the Russian Bank acquired a concession for working naphtha and coal situated on each side of the road to a distance of 40 miles. In 1903 a concession for a road from Astara to Ardabil was granted, but the Company wmnt bankrupt and the road Avas taken over by the Persian GoA T ernment. A Company has since been formed to work this concession; but so far it has limited its activities to the Capital. In 1890 the Persian Government created a tobacco monopoly, the concession for Avffiich Avas granted to a British Company, the Imperial Tobacco Corporation. The monopoly and the concession were both cancelled in 1892, and compensation was paid to the Corporation.xkmmmmmmmmmarnmmm PERSIA— Telegraphs. 25 In 1890 Jacques Poliakoff: of St. Petersburg obtained a concession for a loan bank and “ Mont de Piete Some years later tbe bank, winch had practically become an agency of the Russian State Bank, changed its title to “ Banque d’Escompte.” By the Russo-Persian treaty of 1921 this Bank became the property of the Persian Govern ment. It has now been replaced by the newly formed National Bank. A law governing the creation of an Agricultural Bank was passed at the end of 1930. In 1895 the French Government obtained a concession granting them in perpetuity the exclusive right of searching for objects of antiquarian interest in Persia. This concession has now been annulled by common consent. In 1899 a mining concession in the district of Karadagh in the pro vince of Azerbaijan was granted to Russian capitalists for TO years. Ihe mines are said to contain coal, copper and lead. In 1901 Mr. William Knox D’Arcy secured an exclusive concession for the exploitation of natural gas, petroleum, asphalt and ozokerite throughout the Persian Empire, with the exception of the five provinces of Gilan, Mazanderan, Khorasan, Astarabad and Azerbaijan. This con cession was for 60 years and covered an area of 500,000 square miles. In 1909 a Company, known as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, was formed to take over and operate the concession. Telegraphs. Persian Gulf Submarine Cable and Khanikin-Bushire Line. In 1861 proposals were made for a Convention between the Indian and Persian Governments for the construction of a telegraph line from the Turkish frontier through Persia to Bandar Abbas, to connect with a line from England to India; but in 1862 the Persian Government declined the terms offered. The route through Persia was therefore abandoned, and the Turkish and Indian lines were connected by a sub marine cable in the Persian Gulf. After the failure of the negotiations of 1862, the Shah decided on constructing an alternative line at his own cost from Khanikin through Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz to meet the other line at Bushire: and for this purpose he concluded an Engage ment (No. XXVII) in 1863 to place the construction and working of the line for a time under the superintendence of a British engineer officer; to purchase the materials from the British Government; and to allow the British Government the use of the line on payment of specified charges. In 1863 a treaty was signed between Turkey and Persia, establishing a line of telegraph between the two countries with the point of junction at Khanikin. On account of the uncertainty of the exact frontier line,PERSIA— Telegraphs. 26 two further conventions in regard to their respective telegraph lines were concluded between Persia and Turkey in 1803 and 1804. Khanikin-Bush ire 2nd Line. By a Convention (No. XXVIII) exe cuted at Tehran in 1805, the Persian Government agreed to the erection of another wire on the Bushire and Khanikin line, to he used for inter national messages only, the necessary materials to be provided by the British Government and paid for in five yearly instalments. It was further agreed that the establishment should be paid by the British Government, though the protection of the line was to remain w ith I eisia . and that all receipts up to 30,000 tomans a year should be credited to Persia, the surplus, if any, being made over to the British Government for the cost of their establishment. As the receipts did not amount to this sum in any one year, the cost of establishments and maintenance, Ps. 1,20,000, fell entirely on the British Government. In 1868, however, ’ the’ Persian Government grantedt a 25-year concession to Messrs. Siemens for the construction and management of a telegraph line between Julfa and Tehran: and in 1869, by a “treaty”* con cluded with Mr. George Siemens on behalf of the Indo-European Tele graph Company, they added a concession for the erection and working of a telegraph line between Shiraz and Bandar Abbas, to expire on the 1st January 1905, and extended the term of the Julfa-Tehran concession to the same date. These agreements included arrangements by which the British Government were relieved of a portion of the charges on the Khanikin-Bushire line. Under these, arrangements the Company agreed to pay the Persian Government a fixed annual subsidy of 12,000 tomans in lieu of the 30,000 tomans formerly credited to Persia by the British Government; to deduct from this subsidy an annual instalment of one twenty-fourth of the debt due by Persia to the Biitish Govern ment on account of the cost of construction; and to pay that sum to the British Government. It was agreed that, until that debt was liquidated or so long as the British Government held the concession of the line, the Company should also pay them a moiety of the surplus m excess of the subsidy of 12,000 tomans a year. It was further agreed that, if the Convention of 1865 was not renewed to the British Government, the Company were to have the concession. But in the case of its renewal they were to receive from the Persian Government (Article 1 of “ Treaty ” of 24th May 1869, Appendix No. XXXII) two-thirds of the receipts accruing from the international messages sent on the whole line * The arrangement of 1863 (1280) which was made between Naniik Pasha, (Governor General of Baghdad, and Mirza Husain Khan, Persian Minister at Constantinople, fixed the point of junction on the Turco-Persian frontier for the new through telegraph line by way of Khanikin: and the arrangement of 1864 (1281) was made for the same purpose between Ali Pasha, Turkish Minister foi Foreign Affairs, and Mirza Husain Khan, Persian Minister at Constantinople.

Gwattur Line. In 1868 a Convention (No. XXIX) was concluded, hy which, in order to provide against any accident to the Persian Gulf cable, it was agreed that, in consideration of an annual payment of 3,000 tomans, the British Government should construct and work a line of telegraph between Gwattur and a point between Jask and Bandar Abbas. As originally drawn, this Convention expired in 1888; but, by mutual declarations made in 1887 [see annexure to No. XXIX), it was prolonged till 1905; in 1892 it was again prolonged till 1925; while under the Agreement of 1913 (No. XXXV) it was again prolonged up to 1945. Khanikin-Bushire 3rd Line. The telegraph Convention of 1865 (No. XXVIII) expired in 1872, when it was renewed (No. XXX) for a period of three months, after which a fresh Convention (No. XXXI) for the construction of a third wire was signed. In this Convention the British Government formally agreed to abide by the arrangement made by the Persian Government with the Indo-European Telegraph Company regarding the revenue derived from the Indo-European traffic. The Persian Government, in consideration of a fixed annual payment of 2,000 tomans, ceded to the British Govern ment, for a period of three years, the entire Persian terminal tax on international messages originating or terminating in Persia. After the expiry of three years the Persian Government were left the option of either accepting an annual payment calculated on the basis of two-thirds of the average terminal receipts, or of claiming two-thirds of the receipts from ail bond fide messages. In consequence of certain outrages and damage caused to the line, it was also provided that the British employees should be placed under the special protection of the local authorities, and that the expense of repairing wilful damage to the line should be borne by the Persian Government. In 1887 the Government of India waived their claim to the yearly contribution payable under Article 10 of the Convention : and in the same year the terra of the Convention which, as originally draw-n, would have expired in 1895, was prolonged till 1905 by mutual declarations (see annexure to No. XXXI). In 1892 it was continued for a further period of twenty years while under the Agreement of 1913 (No. XXXV) it was again prolonged up to 1945. In 1915-16 the section of line between Shiraz and Bushire, maintained by the Indo-European Telegraph Department under the 1872 Conven tion, was considerably damaged and partially demolished by rebel tribesmen. It was decided not to claim from the Persians the cost of reconstruction.28 PERSIA— Telegraphs. Chikishliar-Astarabad Line. In 1879 a Convention* was signed between the Russian and Persian Governments, by which the former were to make a line of telegraph from Chikishliar to meet the Persian line at Astarabad : the Convention to hold good for one year and the portion of the line cohstructed in Persian territory to be handed over to the Persian Government after completion. In 1881 a further Conven- tiont was signed permitting Russian employees to work the line: Persia was to receive 80 centimes a word on messages from Julfa to stations east of the Caspian, and 00 centimes a word on messages to places south of Tehran, one-tenth of the sum received to be set apart for repairing the line. The Convention was to remain in force so long as the Russian Government desired to maintain telegraphic communi cation with their military authorities n the provinces to the east of the Caspian Sea. Julfa-Tehrcm, S hiraz-Bandar Abbas and T ehran-Bushire Lines. In 1882 an Agreement^ was arranged between the Persian Government and the Indo-European Telegraph Company under which, with certain modifications, the 1868 and 1869 concessions to the Company (Appendices Nos. XXXI and XXXII) w'ere renewed to the 31st January 1905. In 1882 a Convention, to last three yea^s, was concluded between Turkey and Persia to open the route by Bask Kala Dilman, though at the same time maintaining the Khanikin route. Tehran-Meshed Line. In 1886 the line from Tehran to Meshed, the property of the Persian Government and erected about 1867, was taken over and maintained by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, but no formal Convention was concluded. From the time the line was taken over until the 31st March 1918 the Government of India allotted a sum of twenty thousand rupees annually towards its maintenance: from the 1st April 1918 this was increased to forty thousand rupees. This line was handed back to the Persian Telegraph Administration in 1928 and the Departmeut ceased to work it. In 1887 an Agreement (No. XXXII) was signed, fixing the territorial limits of the telegraph station at Task and certain other details. In 1891 an Agreement^ was arranged between the Shah and the Indo-European Telegraph Company extending the period of the Agree ments of 1868, 1869 and 1882 (Appendices Nos. XXXI, XXXII and XXXV) up to the 1st January 1925. Central, 1 ersia Line. In 1901, with a view to securing uninterrupted communication between Europe and India, it was agreed by a Conven tion (No. XXXIII) between the British and Persian Governments that, in * Appendix No. XXXIII. t Appendix No. XXXTV. 7 Appendix No. XXXY. § Appendix No. XXXVI.wa s signed the former the Persian ear and the uled over to ier Coiiven- the line; &gt;ui Julfato messages to be set apait irce so long c conininni- east of the hre Lina Government vith certain 'Appendices v 1905.

Phis line, generally known as the “ Central Persia Line ”, was opened for traffic in 1907, when it was leased to the Indo-Euro pean Telegraph Department at an annual rental of four per cent, on the capital cost of its construction. Three-quarters of the total annual ren tal was retained by the Indo-European Telegraph Department against the advance made for the construction of the line, which the Persian Government hoped to liquidate by the financial year 1940-41 after which date the full rental of four per cent, would he payable to Persia. Under Article 10 of the Convention it was agreed that the Persian Government were to he provided with an additional wire along the existing line between Tehran and Kashan: but, when this line was examined, it was found that another line of posts would he necessitated. The Persian Minister of Telegraphs accordingly authorised the construction of a second line from Tehran to Kashan on which three wires were erected, one for the use of the Persian Government and two for the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The cost of this Tehran to Kashan line was included in the account for the construction of the Central Persia Line presented to the Persian Government, and its lease was due to expire at the same time as that of the section from Baluchistan to Kashan. The Central Persia Line as originally constructed crossed the frontier between Persian and British Baluchistan at Dorai, and was connected with Robat in British Baluchistan. In 1918, however, as a war measure, the line was diverted from Dorai to Duzdap to meet a railway telegraph line from Mirjawa to Duzdan. These sections were for some time under the control of the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Deoartment; hut in 1924 and 1925 respectively they were placed under the control of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Sistan-Meshed Line. The telegraph line from Sistan to Meshed was constructed in 1902-03 by the Persian Telegraph Administration with the assistance of the Russian Government, who in 1906 assumed the maintenance and control of this line. During the Great War. however, its control passed to British troops, and on their withdrawal to the Indian Telegraph Administration. In 1924 it was handed over to the Persian Government, who promised to pay 40 per cent, of the expenses incurred by the British Government, in two yearly instalments. Henjain-Bandar Abbas Line. In 1905 an Agreement (No. XXKIV) was concluded between Great Britain and Persia for the construction of a line of telegraph to connect the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment’s station at Henjam with Bandar Ahhas across the island of Qishm, at a cost not exceeding Rs. 75,000 : and payment was guaranteed by the Persian Government. On completion and when the cost of oon- D30 PERSIA— Telegraphs. struction had been paid, the line was to be handed over to the Persian Government. The work was completed in December 1905; but, owing to the attitude of the local authorities, the cable was not connected with the Persian Telegraph Office at Bandar Abbas till three years later, while eight months more elapsed before the office was opened for inter national traffic. The bill in connection with the construction of this line was not settled, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department continued to maintain the line. In 1924 the Persian Government agreed to pay off the debt for the cost of construction plus half the cost of maintenance incurred by the Indo-European Telegraph Department up to the 31st March 1923, in twenty-one yearly instalments, and to settle annually half the cost of the annual maintenance charges subsequent to the 31st March 1923. The first instalment was settled through the annual account for 1923-24. Tehran-Khanikin Line. In 1906 an Agreement* was concluded between the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the Persian Gov ernment, under which the Company Avas allowed to make an arrangement with the British Government for taking over the Tehran-Khanikin tele graph line which formed the subject of the Convention of 1865 (No. XXVIII) between the British and Persian Governments. The position of the Indo-European Telegraph Department with regard to the section of line from Tehran to Khanikin is also defined in Article 16 of the Convention of 1872 (No. XXXI) between the British and Persian Governments. In 1906 another Agreement! Acas concluded between the Indo-Euro pean Telegraph Company and the Persian Government, whereby the concession held by the Company Avas prolonged for twenty years from the 1st February 1925. When this agreement Avas made, the Company advanced the Persian Government £40,000, repayable in instalments with interest. A clause in the agreement provided that, in the event of the Persian Government not settling up certain accounts with the Company within a prescribed time, the Company would have the right to collect telegram charges direct from the public. By the Persian Government’s failure to settle accounts regularly, this right Avas acquired by the Company in 1911. The total debt of the Persian Government to the Indo-European Telegraph Company was liquidated in 1925. Borasjun-Ahivaz-Mohammerah and Ahwaz-Dizful Lines. In 1913 an Agreement (No. XXXV) for the reconstruction of the Arabistan Telegraph lines, namely Borasjun-Ahwaz-Mohammerah and Alnvaz- Dizful, was concluded between the British and Persian Governments * Appendix No. XXXVII. t Appendix No. XXXVIII,PERSIA— Telegraphs. 31 The British Government agreed to pay the Persian Government a sum of £5,000 towards the cost of construction, and £300 a year from the date of the commencement of the work up to 1945, towards the main tenance of these lines: the maintenance to remain in the hands of the Indo-European Telegraph Department officials up to 1945. In return for these financial considerations the Persian Government agreed that the period of the Telegraph Conventions of 18G8, 1872 and 1901 (Nos. XXIX, XXXI and XXXIII) should be extended to the 1st January 1945*. During 1915-1916 the section of the line from Borasjun to Bandar Rig was practically demolished by rebel tribesmen, and remained inter rupted until the middle of 1920, when communication with the main Tehran-Bushire line was re-established by connecting Bandar Rig with Bushire by way of Ahmedy. The total cost of constructing this latter section, and of erecting an extra wire on the main Tehran-Bushire line from Ahmedy to Bushire, was borne by the Persian Government. Sistan-Koh-i-Malik Siah Line. In 1914 the construction of a tele graph line, connecting Sistan with the Central Persia Line at a point near Koh-i-Malik Siah, was authorised by the Persian Government pending the conclusion of an agreement with the British Government. The Agreement (Xo. XXXVI) was signed and ratified in 1916. Tinder Article 2 the total cost of the line, less £2,500, is repayable by the Persian Government in thirty years, the Indo-European Telegraph Department being responsible for the control and the cost of maintenance. It was also agreed that, after the control of the line had passed to the Persian Government, it would not be handed over to any Eoreign Government or Company, but that it might be handed back to the Indo-European Telegraph Department by special arrangement agreeable to the parties concerned. In 1916 a second wire was added to this line in accordance with the terms of Article 3 of the Agreement. Bandar Abbas-Kerman and Baft-Saidabad Lines. In 1913 the ques tion of the Indo-European Telegraph Department constructing a line of telegraphs between Bandar Abbas and Kerman on behalf of the Persian Government was considered. Early in 1916 a project for the construc tion of a line to connect Kerman, Bandar Abbas, Lingeh and Jask was discussed between the Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department, and the Persian Minister of Telegraphs; but no definite agreement was arrived at. In August it was decided that the work on the line from Bandar Abbas to Kerman should be started as soon as possible and that it was unnecessary to await an agreement with the Persian Government. * The terms of the Agreement provided that it should be submitted for approval to the Majlis save in the case of Article 3, by which the concessions wei’e prolonged till 1945 and which was sanctioned by the Cabinet and specifically excepted from the number of Articles to he submitted for Majlis’ approval. Those Articles have not in fact ever been submitted to or ratified by the Majlis. D 232 PERSIA—SISTAN. The line was completed in 1917 and in the same year a branch temporary line was constructed from Baft to Saidabad (Sirjan). An agreement was signed in 1920 by the Persian Minister of Telegraphs and the Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department, covering the construction of lines from Kerman to Bandar-Abbas, from Bandar-Abbas to Task, and from Bandar-Abbas to Lingeh, together with a branch temporary line from Baft to Saidabad, but the agreement was never ratified. In 1921, the proposal to construct the lines from Bandar-Abbas to Task and to Lingeh was abandoned, and a revised draft agreement omitting all mention of these was drafted in 1923; but was still under discussion on the date of the withdrawal from Persia of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. In 1923 a Telegraph Convention* was concluded between Persia and Russia, in accordance with Article 21 of the Russo-Persian Treaty of February 1921 (Appendix No XXV). In October 1930 His Majesty’s Government informed the Persian Government that the whole of the Indo-European Telegraph Department organisation except the Cable Stations in the Persian Gulf and the Persian section of the Task-Gwattur line would be withdrawn from Persia on the 1st March 1931 This decision had been taken in connec tion with the negotiations then proceeding for the conclusion of a general treatv, and in response to the repeatedly expressed wishes of the Persian Government; the six months’ notice provided for in the Department’s concessions was not, therefore, given. An Agreement setting out the conditions subject to which the with drawal of the Department was arranged with the Persian Government is under discussion with that Government. The Indo-European Telegraph Company, which for several years had been working at a loss, decided to withdraw at the same time, and so informed the Persian Government in December 1930. Sistan. The rival claims of Persia and Afghanistan to sovereignty over Ristan were for many years productive of disputes rvhich more than once threatened a rupture of friendly relations behveen the two States. Ristan was in ancient times, and especially^ under the Rafavian dynasty, a dependency of Persia. On the death of Nadir Rhah it became an inte gral portion of the Durani empire founded by Ahmad Rhah Abdali. On the dismemberment of the Durani empire, Sistan became dependent at one time on Herat, 'when that province was isolated from the rest of Afghanistan, with intervals of independence more or less prolonged, and later still on Herat and Kandahar alternately. Although no inter ference was exercised by Persia in the internal administration of Ristan, * Appendix No. XXXIX.PERSIA—SISTAN. 33 the dissensions among the Barakzai family led to the diminution of Afghan influence and, after the death of Kohandil Khan in 1855, Ali Khan Sarbandi, who had been installed by him some years previously as ruler of south-western Sistan, made overtures to Persia in the hope of enjoying a greater amount of independence under a power which, from its distance, would be less able to enforce obedience. Ali Khan was received with honour at Tehran, married a princess of the royal family, and returned to Sistan with an allowance of 4,000 tomans a year: a sum of 3,000 tomans a year was also bestowed on Ibrahim Khan of Chakansur, the principal Chief of northern Sistan, and the other Chiefs. In return for these subsidies the Chiefs undertook to prevent Baluch raiders from entering Persian territory. In 1858 Ali Khan was assas sinated by his nephew, Taj Muhammad, who eventually expressed his willingness to continue his predecessor’s engagements with Persia. The sovereignty of Persia over Sistan was, however, never recognized by the British Government: and an intimation to that effect was con veyed to the Persian Government when, in 1862, the Shah claimed the execution of the Tth article of the Treaty of 1857 (No. XVIII) on the ground of the alleged intention of Dost Muhammad Khan to require the submission of Sistan. In 1863 Persia, again apprehensive of an invasion of Sistan by Dost Muhammad Khan, who was then engaged in the ex pedition against Herat, was anxious to obtain an assurance that the British Government would not permit any such invasion of Persian territory; but the British Government declined to interfere in the matter, and left it to both parties to make good their possession by force of arms. Towards the end of 1865 an armed advance was made into Sistan by Persia, with the alleged object of enabling Taj Muhammad to keep in check Baluch raiders who had committed depredations on Persian territory. In 1867 the dominion of Persia over the part of Sistan, south west of the Helmand, was completed by the removal of Taj Muhammad, his brother and his uncle to Tehran. Thenceforward it was the aim of Persia to obtain possession of the territory of Ibrahim Khan of Chakan sur, north of the Helmand; and Mir Alam Khan, the Persian Governoi of Kain, succeeded in occupying the whole of Sistan proper; i.e., the country lying between the Hamun on the north and west, and the Helmand, below the Kohak dam, on the east. During the civil wars, which after the death of Dost Muhammad Khan distracted Afghanistan, the progress of the Persians met with little opposition; but on the estab lishment of Amir Sher Ali Khan’s power the Afghans found themselves in a position to retaliate, and raids on both sides of the border became oi constant occurrence. The Persian Government having expressed a wish for the good offices of the British Government in placing the relations of Persia with Afghanistan with regard to Sistan on a more satisfactory footing, the34 PERSIA—SISTAN. British Minister at Tehran was, under article 6 of the Treaty of 1857, instructed to offer British arbitration on the question of the sovereignty and boundaries of the whole of Sistan on both sides of the river Helmand, on the basis of ancient right and present possession. The Shah even tually agreed that commissioners on the part of the British Government, Persia and Afghanistan, respectively, should meet in Sistan, where the two latter were to state and substantiate their claims; that, if local enquiry should be necessary, the commissioners were to proceed to any point for that purpose and make a map of the districts; that, when the British Commissioner considered that nothing further could be done on the spot, the commissioners should proceed to Tehran, where the subject would be fully discussed with a view to its settlement, and the British Commissioner would state his opinion as arbitrator; and that, should either the Persian or Afghan Government not agree to this opinion, reference should be made to the British Government, whose decision should be final and binding on both Governments. Accordingly, after some delay caused by the troubles in Afghanistan consequent on Muham mad Yakub Khan’s rebellion, the commissioners met on the frontier early in 1872, and the opinion of General Goldsmid, the British Com missioner, was delivered in the following August (see Part II, Afghanis tan). An appeal was preferred by the Persian Government, but even tually the decision of General Goldsmid was accepted unconditionally by the Shah and confirmed by the British Government. In the winter of 1872 the petty Chiefs occupying the Persian portion of Sistan combined against the authority of the Persian Governor, Mir Alam Khan of Kain, and compelled him to retire from the country. As their grievances were ascertained to be real, Mir Alam Khan was replaced by another Governor; he was, however, re-appointed in December 1874 and letained the post until his death in 1891. He was succeeded by his eldest son Ali Akbar Khan with the title of Hashmat-ul-Mulk (sub sequently altered to TIisam-ud-Daulah) as Governor of Sistan, while the Governorship of the Kainat was given to the younger son Ismail Khan with the title of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. The Governorship of Sistan and the Kainat thus became separate and have remained so ever since. All appointments to the Governorships have however hitherto remained in the same family. Ihe establishment by Russia of a Consulate in Sistan in 1899 was followed m 1900 by the appointment of a British Consul in Sistan and Ka m with a view to the promotion of trade via the newly-opened Nushki- Sistan route, and the improvement of British relations with the local Persian authorities. In 1902, owing to strained relations between Persia and Afghanistan regarding the boundary in Sistan and the division of the water of the Helmand river, the Persian Government applied to the British Govern-' of 1851, vereignty Helmand, i&amp;h even- 'ernment, ^here the i if local d to any when the 3 done on e -f, opinion, gly, after Mnharn- ish Coin.

His award as regards tbe boundary was accepted by botb Governments in 1905. Tbe water award was not accepted in its entirety by tbe Afghan Govern ment, and was altogether rejected by tbe Persians on tbe ground that they were more favourably treated under tbe Goldsmid award of 1873. This latter award still governs tbe distribution of tbe water of tbe Hel mand river. No events of any particular importance occurred in Sistan between 1905 and 1915; but in tbe latter year British forces operating from Baluchistan entered Persian territory in order to intercept armed parties of Germans, Austrians and Turks from crossing into Afghanistan: and a cordon of troops was established from Nusbki to tbe llussian frontier near Askbabad. In connection with these operations tbe Sarbad district of Persian Baluchistan was temporarily occupied in 1916 by a British force, and its turbulent tribal chiefs reduced to order. In 1918 tbe Spezand-Nusbki branch of the North Western Railway, which bad been pushed westwards across tbe desert as part of tbe line of communications of tbe East Persia Cordon Field Force, entered Persian territory at Mirjawa and in 1919 was carried to Duzdap, 54 miles on tbe Persian side of tbe frontier. Tbe Persian section of the line was closed down in July 1931 and it is no longer operated beyond Nok Fundi. With tbe exception of small detachments for the safety of tbe rail way, which were removed in 1924 when tbe Sarbad was vacated, all British troops in Persia were withdrawn in 1921. Peesian Baluchistan and Keeman. A British Consul was first sent to Kerman in 1894, but tbe Consulate was not formally established till 1902. In 1896 and 1897 Persian Baluchistan remained in a very disturbed condition. Robbery and murder were rife and tbe unrest culminated in tbe murder of Mr. Graves, a Superintendent of tbe Indo-European Telegraph line, at bis camp on tbe Rapcb river. Enquiry proved that tbe murder was committed by Kerwani tribesmen, and tbe Darya Begi, Governor-General of Busbire, with tbe co-operation of the Resident, eventually succeeded in bringing to justice several of tbe gang responsible for tbe outrage. In 1897 tbe quantity of arms being smuggled into Afghanistan via tbe Makran coast attracted tbe serious attention of tbe Government of India. A Naval blockade was eventually established, and by tbe end of 1909 tbe traffic bad been considerably reduced. A small Field Force, sent to Makran in 1911 to deal with tbe arms traffic on land, attacked and defeated Mir Barkat who bad established himself as Chief of tbe Biyaban district in 1908.3ti PEES1A—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND KERMAN. In 1902 Lt.-Colonel Showers with a small mixed force joined the Governor-General of Kerman who was accompanied by Persian troops, in order to inflict punishment upon certain Nusherwanis who had raided Kuntdar and other places in British territory, and to recover compensation for the damage inflicted in these raids. The expedition w'as entirely successful; but no arrangements were made for the per manent pacification of the country. In 1903 a Commercial Mission composed of private persons, but organized with the Government of India’s support, visited South Eastern Persia, travelling via Bandar Abbas, Kerman, Yezd, Shiraz and Bushire, with the object of studying openings for British trade; and in 1913 a Geological Survey was made of some of the most promising geological areas. Neither of these parties discovered anything likely to increase the prosperity of the Province. In 1912-13 Railway survey parties surveyed railway routes between Karachi and Kerman. Nothing came of the project. During 1914 the Great War had no effect upon Kerman. In 1915 however German agents, taking advantage of disorder in the out lying districts and the political ferment in the town, succeeded in inti midating the Governor-General: and the whole British community, including the Consul, had to leave Kerman in December. In 1916 order was restored by the South Persia Rifles, under the command of Brigadier- General Sir Percy Sykes. The South Persia Rifles were disbanded in October 1921. In the spring of 1908 Mir Bahram Khan, Baranzai, of Dizak, an upstait \\ azn of the Buzurgzada Dakim of Jalk and Dizak, succeeded m ejecting the Persian Governor from Bampur, where he soon estab lished himself. In September 1915 he raided British territory to within 8 miles of Gwattur, but was ultimately driven out by the Nazim of Makran. Early in 1916 German agents extended their activities to the Sarhad and endeavoured to raise the tribes there against the British. General Dyer was despatched with a small force, and Major Keyes was sent from the South to pacify the tribes on the borders of Makran, where the recent murder of Hughes, Commandant of the Makran Levy Corps, and his Adjutant, Horst, had shewn the gravity of the situation. These measures, and the formation of the Sarhad Levy Corps, led to the restoration of order. The Corps was disbanded in 1924. Mil Bahram Khan of Bampur died in 1921 and was succeeded by Mir Dost Mohamed Khan who, though ready formally to acknowledge the suzerainty ol the Shah in order to avoid being interfered with, was in effect the independent ruler of Persian Baluchistan (there having been no Persian Governor of Bampur since 1908) till the autumn of 1928. In September of that year a proclamation was issued depriving DostPEKS1A—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND KERMAN. 37 Aloliamed Kiuaii of tlie (jovemorsliip of lialucliistan, and in October a con-certed attack was begun on iiampur, wkicli was occupied in November. Dost AloJiamed Klian fled to Sarbaz and, after prolonged negotiations, sued for pardon, winch was granted in February 1929 on condition that he should come to Tehran and tender his submission in person to the Shah. This he did in April, and was well received by the Shah, but was kept in honourable captivity from which he escaped in November. He was recaptured in December and taken to Tehran; where, in January 1930, he was tried, found guilty and executed for the murder of the Persian policemen in charge of him at the time of his escape. The safety of the Indo-European Telegraph Department line from the British border to Jask was provided for by the payment of subsidies to the local Baluch chiefs. In the unsettled conditions caused by the Dreat W ar, however, they' were unable to control one Khair Mohamed, an Afghan of Sirhingi known locally as the Xhalifah. In 1915 this individual attacked the outposts at J ask and Chahbar, destroying the telegraph lines. He was repulsed and the lines were repaired; but early in 191b ne again did extensive damage to the line: and, in view of the importance of communication with Mesopotamia, a cable was laid between Jask and Chahbar as an alternative to the land line. In March 1924 the control of the tribes of the Sarhad district of Persian Baluchistan (who had enjoyed subsidies paid by 7 the British Crovernment subsequent to the occupation of the country in 1915-1916} was formally surrendered to the Persian Government, who undertook to continue the payments hitherto made by the British authorities. The Persians, however, failed to keep this undertaking: and disturbances broKe out in the Sarhad during the summer of 1925 and again in 1926, owing partly 7 to the high handed methods of certain of the military officials and partly to discontent due to non-receipt of the subsidies. The disturbances were quelled, wuthout serious fighting, after further assurances had been given by the Persian Government. In 1926 Consular charge of the Sarhad was transferred from the Kerman to the Sistan Consulate. In 1927 a Soviet Consul was appointed to Sistan.38 PERSIA.

The Great God having, of his infinite mercy, given victory unto Karem Khan, and. made him Chief Governor of all the kingdoms of Persia, and established under him the peace and tranquillity of the said kingdoms, by means of his victorious sword, he is desirous that the said kingdoms should flourish and re-obtain their ancient grandeur by the increase of trade and commerce, as well as by a due execu tion of justice. Having been informed that the Right Worshipful William Andrew Price, Esq., Governor-General for the English nation in the Gulf of Persia, is arrived with power to settle a factory at Bushire, and has left Mr. Benjamin Jervis, Resident, who, by directions from the said Governor-General, has sent unto me Mr. Thomas Durnford and Stephen Hermit, linguist, to obtain a grant of their ancient privileges in these kingdoms, I do, of my free will and great friendship for the English nation, grant unto the said Governor-General, in behalf of his king and Company, the following privileges, which shall be inviolably observed and held sacred in good faith 6 That the English Company may have as much ground, and in any part of Bushire, they choose to build a factory on, or at any other port in the Gulf.

Articles desired by the Khan, —1763. That the English, according to what was formerly customary, shall purchase from the Persian merchants such goods as will answer for sending to England or India, provided they and the Persians shall agree on reasonable prices for the same, and not export from Persia the whole amount of their sales in ready money, as this will imooverish the kingdom and in the end prejudice trade in general.

Article 3. Should any European power engaged in war with Persia make peace with England, His Britannic Majesty engages to use his best endeavours to bring Persia and such European power to a friendly understanding ; if, however, His Majesty’s cordial interference shall fail of success, England shall still furnish an army from India, as specified in the last Article, or pay an annual subsidy of two hundred thousand tomans for the support of a Persian army, so long as a war in the supposed case shall continue, and until Persia shall make peace with such nation.

Article 12. The intention of this Treaty and the respective wishes of the High contracting powers are to afford mutual assistance, and thereby strengthen, consolidate, and extend their power and dominions for the purpose of defeating the aggressions of their enemies. As the sincere desire of His Britannic Majesty particularly is to strengthen and consolidate the Persian Government so as to prevent foreign nations from invading Persia, and by his assistance to raise her political consequence and to increase her territory, the English Government will not interfere in any quarrels which may hereafter arise between the Princes, Noblemen, or great Chiefs of Persia, until the King then reigning shall require their assistance ; and if one of the contend- parties should offer a province of Persia with a view of obtaining assistance, the English Government shall not agree to such a proposal, nor by accepting it possess themselves of such part of Persia. The Articles are thus auspiciously concluded. This happy and fortunate Treaty, it is hoped, will for ever continue in force and produce the fairest and most beneficial results. We, the undersigned plenipotentiaries of the high contracting powers, having concluded this auspicious Treaty in the true spirit of amity and sincerity in the twelve foregoing Articles, have hereunto set our hands and seals, in the royal city of Teheran, this fourteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twelve, corresponding with the twenty-ninth of Safer-ol-Mazafer, in the year of the Hegira one thousand two hundred and twenty-seven.

If the Persian Government had appreciated my representations on this subject, the prohibition would ere this have been sanctioned ; but as this has not been the case, I am now obliged to demand a clear and decisive answer on this subject, as to whether the Persian Government will issue an order prohibiting the importa tion of negroes by sea or not. If it be the intention of the Persian Government to issue this order, I request to be made acquainted with it to-day ; and if it is not their intention to do so, an immediate and explicit answer is necessary to enable me to forward it for the information of my Government, and that Your Excellency, after all your pro mises, should no longer evade giving me a decided answer on this subject. The British Government are very anxious to know the determination of the Persian Government, and I therefore request Your Excellency will be good enough to send me a positive answer, as my Government will not consent to any further delay on my part in this matter.74 PERSIA—NO.

Convention concluded between Colonel Sheil and Ameer-e-Nizam for the detention and search of Persian vessels by British and East India Com pany’s cruizers,— 1851. The Persian Grovernment agrees that the ships of war of the British Govern ment and of the East India Company shall, in order to prevent the chance of negro slaves, male and female, being imported, be permitted for the period of eleven years to search Persian merchant vessels in the manner detailed in this document, with the exception of Persian Government vessels, not being vessels the property of merchants, or the property of Persian subjects ; with those government vessels there is to be no interference whatever. The Persian Government agrees that in no manner whatever shall any negro slaves be imported in the vessels of the Persian Government. The Agreement is this— First .—That in giving this permission to search mercantile vessels and those of subjects, the search shall from the first to the last be effected with the co-opera tion, intervention, and knowledge of Persian officers, who are to be on board vessels of the English Government. Second .—The merchant vessels shall not be detained longer than is necessary to effect the search for slaves. If slaves should be found in any of those vessels the British authorities are to take possession of them, and to carry them away, without detaining or causing them (that is, the people of the ship importing slaves) any other damage besides that of depriving them of the slaves. The vessel itself in which the slaves have been imported shall, by the co-operation and knowledge of the officers of the Persian Government, who are on board of the British cruizers, be delivered to the authorities of the Persian ports, who are there on the part of the Persian Government ; and the authorities of this (the Persian) Government are to punish and fine, in a manner suitable to the crime he has committed, the owner of that slaving vessel who has acted in contravention of the commands of His Majesty the King of Persia by importing slaves. The British ships of war are not in any manner to interfere with the Persian trading vessels without the co-operation of the Persian Government officers ; but the Persian Government officers must not on their part be remiss in the duty committed to them. This convention is to be in force for a period of eleven years, and after these eleven years have expired, and the stipulated period has elapsed, if the Persian vessels shall be interfered with for even a single day beyond the eleven years, it will be opposed to the course of friendship with the Persian Government and to the maintenance of her rights, and this Government will make a demand for satis faction.

The Persian Government engages not to send troops on any account to the territory of Herat, excepting when troops from without attack that place, that is to say, troops from the direction of Cabool, or from Candahar, or from other foreign territory ; and in case of troops being despatched under such circumstances, the Persian Government binds itself that they shall not enter the city of Herat, and that immediately on the retreat of the foreign troops to their own country, the Persian force shall forthwith return to the Persian soil without delay. The Persian Government nlso engages to abstain from all interference whatso ever in the internal affairs of Herat, likewise in (regard to) occupation or taking possession, or assuming the sovereignty or government, except that the same * This translation was made in 1857 from the original Persian document, as spme doubt was raised as to the correctness of the translaticn made in 1853. G78 PERSIA—NO. XVII—1853. amount of interference which took place between the two in the time of the late Zuheer-ood-Dowlah, Yar Mahomed Khan, is to exist as formerly. I he Persian Government, therefore, engages to address a letter to byed Mahomed Khan, acquainting him with these conditions, and to forwnrd it to him (by a person) accompanied by some one belonging to the English mission, who may be in Meshed. The Persian Government also engages to relinquish all claim or pretension to the coinage of money and to the “ Khootbeth ”, or to any other mark whatever of subjection or of allegiance on the part of the people of Herat to Persia. But if, as in the time of the late Kamran and in that of the late Yar Mahomed Khan, they should, of their own accord, send an offering in money and strike it in the Shah’s name, Persia will receive it without making any objection. This condition will also be immediately communicated to Syed Mahomed Khan. They also engage to recall Abbas Koolee Khan, Peeseean, after four months from the date of his arrival, so that he may not reside there permanently ; and hereafter no per manent agent will be placed in Herat, but intercourse will be maintained as in the time of Yar Mahomed Khan. Neither will they maintain a permanent agent on the part of Herat in Teheran. There will be the same relations and privileges which existed in Kamran’s time, and in that of the late Yar Mahomed Khan. 1 or instance, if at any time it should be necessary for the punishment of the Tobrko- mans, or in case of disturbance or rebellion in the Shah’s dominions, that the Persian Government should receive assistance from the Heratees, similar to that afforded by the late Yar Mahomed Khan, they may, as formerly, render assistance of their own accord and free-will, but not of a permanent nature. The Persian Government further engages, unconditionally and without excep tion, to release and set free all the Chiefs of Herat who are in Meshed or in Teheran or in ary other part of Persia, and not to receive any offenders, prisoners, or sus pected persons whatsoever from Syed Mahomed Khan, with the exception of such persons as having been banished by Syed Mahomed Khan from Herat may come here and themselves desire to remain, or to enter the service. These will be treated with kindness and favour as formerly. Distinct orders will be issued immediately to the Prince Governor of Khorassan to carry out these engagements. The above six engagements on the part of the Persian Government are to be observed and to have effect; and the Persian ministers, notwithstanding the rights which they possess in Herat, solely out of friendship, and to satisfy the English Government, have entered into these engagements with the English Government so long as there is no interference whatsoever on its part in the internal affairs of Herat and its dependencies ; otherwise these engagements will be null and void, and as if they never had existed or been written. And if any foreign (State), either Afghan or other, should desire to interfere with or encroach upon the terri tory of Herat or its dependencies and the Persian ministers should make the request, the British Government are not to be remiss in restraining them and in giving their friendly advice, so that Herat may remain in its own state of independence, Seal and autograph of the Sadr Azim.PEES] A—NO. XVII—1853. 79 {Translation.) I HE Sadr Azim to Syed Mahomed Khan, Ruler of Herat, —January 26th, 1853. The Persian ministers, from tlie time when they began to give aid and assistance to you, my son, had no intention of taking possession or assuming sovereignty over Herat; nay, they were desirous that it should remain in a state of independ ence, and be preserved from the attacks and invasions of foreigners. They had no views of acquisition on the Herat soil, or of raising contributions from Herat or the people of Herat, and these circumstances were made known to the Mufti (lately Political Agent from the Governor of Herat to the Shah) when he was here. Now, when their intentions have, thank God, been accomplished, it is necessary that I should inform you, my son, of the Articles and engagements which the (Persian) ministers have imposed upon themselves. They are to the following effect:— That the Persian ministers never had, nor will ever have, any idea of taking possession, assuming the sovereignty or governing either Herat or the Herat territory, or its people, and will not interfere in any manner whatsoever in the internal affairs of Herat, so that they may be independent in their country and their own affairs, without the interference of any one belonging either to this gov ernment or to the Afghans of Cabool and Candahar, or other foreigners. They will not in any manner agree that the Khootbeh (prayer in the Shah’s name) should be recited-in the name of His Majesty (the Shah). With regard to the coinage also, solely to secure your independence, my son, they will never consent that the current coin should be struck in the name of His Majesty (the Shah). But if, as in the times of the late Kamran and the late Yar Mahomed Khan, you should desire to send a sum of money as an offering, and that money should be struck in His Majesty’s name, the Persian ministers will not object to it and it will be received. If at any time it should be necessary that the people of Herat should give assistance to Persia in order to punish the Toorkomans, or when there is a disturbance or rebellion in the Persian territory, they may of their own free-will, as was formerly done in the time of the late Yar Mahomed Khan, send assistance in men, but not as a permanent force. Yes, that which His Majesty the Shah considers imperative on him, on account of his services rendered by the late Zuheer- ood-Dowlah is, that if any foreign troops, Afghan or other, should invade Herat, the ministers of this ever-enduring State shall despatch troops to the aid of Heratees, to join the Herat troops outside of the town of Herat, and when the foreign troops have been expelled from the Herat soil, to return immediately to the Persian territory. No doubt after you have become acquainted with the real sentiments of the (Persian) ministers, you will act in conformity with them. {Translation.) Firman of the Shah to Syed Mahomed Khan, Ruler of Herat,—J anuary 29th, 1853. Let the high in rank, etc., Zuheer-ood-Dowlah, Syed Mahomed Khan, feel assured of our royal favour, and know that the engagement given by the ministers G 280 PERSIA—NO. XVII—1853. of this Government, with regard to Herat, and to acquire independence for him, is as His Excellency the Sadr Azim has written to him. No doubt he, Syed Mahomed Khan, will be made acquainted with it, and will act in conformity with it. Let him know that he enjoys the highest favour of our royal person, and re present his prayers to us. Lieutenant-Colonel Sheil to Syed Mahomed Khan, Rulek of Herat. Your Excellency has no doubt heard of the anxiety testified many years ago by the government of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain for the maintenance of the independence of Herat. Although circumstances have withdrawn Her Majesty’s government of late from any direct connection with Afghanistan, they have not ceased to take a warm interest in the welfare and prosperity of Herat, and in the preservation of its independence under Afghan rule. They have watched with solicitude during the last year and a half, since Your Excellency’s accession to the government of that country, the progress of events in Herat, and the issue has been that they have felt themselves called on to require an explanation from the Persian ministers for their share in certain proceedings connected with Your Excellency’s territory, and to claim from them assurances for the maintenance of that territory independent of Persian rule. The discussions which followed ter minated in certain engagements concluded by this government, and which I deem it my duty to bring to the knowledge of Your Excellency. They are contained in the three enclosed papers, which are copies of the originals, consisting of a docu ment sealed by the Prime Minister of Persia, a letter from the Prime Minister to Your Excellency, and a Firman from the Shah to your address, ratifying the engagements of the Sadr Azim. These documents sufficiently explain the views of Great Britain, which, briefly stated, are a determination that Herat shall remain in Afghan hands and in inde pendence. I sincerely trust that the time has arrived when you will cease to require aid from the government of this country, and that hencefo ward Your Excellency will be able alone to maintain the integrity of your country. Your Excellency may be assured that the ruler who seeks foreign aid loses the respect and the loyalty of his subjects, and that there is only one termination to repeated applications for foreign succour. The good-will of your subjects is your surest safeguard. By upright, just, and impartial government, by cultivating Afghan national feeling, there can be no doubt of your ability to maintain your position against all intru - ders, in the same manner that your Excellency’s father, the late Yar Mahomed Khan, accomplished with such brilliant success. My messenger, who will deliver this communication, will await Your Excel lency s convenience to return with an answer in acknowledgment of its receipt.PERSIA—NO. XVIII—1857i 81 No. XVIII.

His Majesty the Shah of Persia agrees to relinquish all claims to sovereignty over the territory and city of Herat and the countries of Afghanistan, and never to demand from the Chiefs of Herat, or of the countries of Afghanistan, any marks of obedience, such as the coinage, or “ Khootbeh ”, or tribute. His Majesty further engages to abstain hereafter from all interference with the internal affairs of Afghanistan. His Majesty promises to recognise the inde pendence of Herat and of the whole of Afghanistan, and never to attempt to inter fere with the independence of those States.

Article 8. The Persian Government engages to set at liberty without ransom, immediately after the exchange of the ratifications of this Treaty, all prisoners taken during the operations of the Persian troops in Afghanistan, and all Afghans who may be detained either as hostages or as captives on political grounds in any part of the Persian dominions shall, in like manner, be set free ; provided that the Afghans, on their part, set at liberty, without ransom, the Persian prisoners and captives who are in the power of the Afghans.

The Shah to the Sadr Azim, December 1855. Last night we read the paper written by the English minister plenipotentiary, and were much surprised at the rude, unmeaning, disgusting, and insolent tone and purport. The letter which he before wrote was also impertin ent. We have also heard that in his own house he is constantly speaking disrespect fully of us and of you, but we never believed ; now, however, he has introduced it in an official letter. We arc therefore convinced that this man, Mr. Murray, is stupid, ignorant, and insane, who has the audacity and impudence to insult even kings. From the time of Shah Sultan Hossein (when Persia was in its most dis organised state, and during the last fourteen years of his life, when by serious ill ness he was incapacitated for business) up to the present time, no disrespect towards the sovereign has been tolerated, either from the government or its agent. What has happened now T that this foolish minister plenipotentiary acts with such temerity ? It appears that our friendly missions are not acquainted with the wording of that document; give it now to Mirza Abbas and Mirza Malcum, that they may take and duly explain it to the French Minister and Hyder Effendi, that they may see how improperly he has written. Since last night till now our time has been passed in vexation. We now command you, in order that you may yourself know, and also acquaint the missions, that until the Queen of England herself makes us a suitable apology for the insolence of her envoy, we will never receive back this her foolish Minister, who is a simpleton, or accept from her government any other Minister.PERSIA—NO.

His Britannic Majesty’s Government further engage to exercise their influence in Afghanistan only in a pacific sense, and they will not themselves take, nor encourage Afghanistan to take, any measures threatening Russia. The Russian Government, on their part, declare that they recognise Afghan istan as outside the sphere of Russian influence, and they engage that all their political relations with Afghanistan shall be conducted through the intermediary of His Britannic Majesty’s Government; they further engage not to send any Agents into Afghanistan. Article 2. The Government of His Britannic Majesty having declared in the Treaty sign ed at Kabul on the 21st March 1905, that they recognise the agreement and the engagements concluded with the late Ameer Abdur Rahman, and that they have no intention of interfering in the internal government of Afghan territory, Great Britain engages neither to annex nor to occupy in contravention of that Treaty any portion of Afghanistan or to interfere in the internal administration of the country, provided that the Ameer fulfils the engagements already contracted by him towards His Britannic Majesty’s Government under the abovementioned Treaty. Article 3. The Russian and Afghan authorities specially designated for the purpose on the frontier in the frontier provinces, may establish direct relations with each other for the settlement of local questions of a non-political character.

Should the progress of trade establish the necessity for Commercial Agents, the two Governments will agree as to what measures shall be taken, due regard, of course, being had to the Ameer’s sovereign rights. Article 5. The present arrangements will only come into force when His Britannic Ma jesty s Government shall have notified to the Russian Government the consent of the Ameer to the terms stipulated above. Arrangement concerning Thibet. Ihe Governments of Great Britain and Russia recognising the suzerain rights of China in Thibet, and considering the fact that Great Britain, by reason of her■B—m PERSIA—NO. XXI—1907. j geographical position, has a special interest in the maintenance of the status quo in the external relations of Thibet, have made the following arrangement: Article 1 . The two High Contracting Parties engage to respect the territorial integrity of Thibet and to abstain from all interference in the internal administration. Article 2 . In conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Thibet, Great Britain and Russia engage not to enter into negotiations with Thi bet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government. This engage ment does not exclude the direct relations between British Commercial Agents and the Thibetan authorities provided for in Article V of the Convention between Great Britain and Thibet of the 7th September 1904, and confirmed by the Con vention between Great Britain and China of the 27th April 1906 ; nor does it modify the engagements entered into by Great Britain and China in Article I of the said Convention of 1906. It is clearly understood that Budhists, subjects of Great Britain or of Russia, may enter into direct relations on strictly religious matters with the Dalai Lama and the other representatives of Budhism in Thibet; the Governments of Great Britain and Russia engage, as far as they are concerned, not to allow those rela tions to infringe the stipulations of the present engagement. Article 3. i The British and Russian Governments respectively engage not to send Re presentatives to Lhassa. Article 4. The two High Contracting Parties engage neither to seek nor to obtain, whether for themselves or their subjects, any Concessions for railways, roads, telegraphs, and mines, or other rights in Thibet.

Annex to the Arrangement between Great Britain and Russia concerning Thibet.

XXI—1907. by British forces shall cease after the payment of three annual instalments of the indemnity of 25,00,000 rupees, provided that the trade marts mentioned in Article II of that Convention have been effectively opened for three years, and that in the meantime the Thibetan authorities have faithfully complied in all respects with the terms of the said Convention of 1904. It is clearly understood that if the occupation of the Chumbi Valley by the British forces has, for any reason, not been terminated at the time anticipated in the above Declaration, the British and Russian Governments will enter upon a friendly exchange of views on this subject. The present Convention shall bo ratified, and the ratifications exchanged at St. Petersburgh as soon as possible.

The Governments of Great Britain and Russia, desiring to avoid any cause of conflict between their respective interests in certain regions in Persia contigu ous to, or in the immediate neighbourhood of the frontiers of Afghanistan and Baluchistan, on the one hand, and of the Russian frontier, on the other hand, have signed a friendly agreement on the subject. In that agreement the two Governments mutually agree to the strict integrity and independence of Persia and testify that they sincerely desire the pacific de velopment of that country as well as the permanent establishment of equal ad vantages for the commerce and industry of all other nations. Each of the two States further engages, in case the Persian Government grants concessions to foreigners, not to seek concessions adjoining, or in the neighbourhood of, the frontiers of the other. In order to prevent misunderstandings in future and to avoid creating an order of things which might place the Persian Government in an embarrassing situation in any respect whatever, the above-mentioned regions are clearly defined in the arrangements. In mentioning the revenues which aremm/mm 126 PERSIA—NOS. XXII—1907 AND XXIII—1913. affected to the loans concluded by the Persian Government with the Discount and Loan Bank and the Imperial Bank of Persia, the Russian and British Gov ernments recognise that these revenues will be in future affected to the same pur pose as in the past and the two Governments equally engage in the case of irregu larities in the amortization or in the payment of interest on the above-mentioned loan to enter on a friendly exchange of views in order to determine by common agreement the measures which in conformity with the law of Nations, it would be necessary to take in order to safeguard the interests of the creditors and to avoid all interference which would not be in conformity with the principles of that arrangement. In signing that arrangement the two States have not for a moment lost sight of the fundamental jmnciple of absolute respect of the integrity and independence of Persia. The arrangement has no other object than that of avoiding any cause of misunderstanding between the contracting parties on the ground of Persian affairs.

As further evidence of the good-will by which the Cabinet of London, is inspired, I am now authorised to inform Your Highness that, in the event of the agreement regarding projects of reforms which your Government contemplates introducing in Persia being concluded, His Britannic Majesty’s Government will be prepared in due course to co-operate with the Persian Government with a view to the realisation of the following desiderata :— (1) The revision of the treaties actually in force between the two Powers. (2) The claim of Persia to compensation for material damage suffered at the hands of other belligerents. (3) The rectification of the frontier of Persia at the points where it is agreed upon by the parties to be justifiable.

XXVI—1928. Note to Acting Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs recording the position with regard to an Error in the Dominions Notes of May 10. Sir R. Clive to M. PaJcrevan. Tehran, November 30, 1928. (No. 306). AL le Gee ANT, Under instructions from His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain, I have the honour to draw Your Excellency’s attention to an error which appears in the notes annexed to the Anglo-Persian Tariff Autonomy Treaty of the 10th May last. This error has already on several occasions formed the subject of discus sion with His Highness the Minister of Court, and it is now the wish of my Govern ment to put on record the fact that a certain passage in the notes mentioned above has been wrongly drafted, and to explain what it had been intended to say. 2. The passage in question occurs twice, firstly in paragraph 2 of my first note regarding the position of the self-governing Dominions of Canada, the Com monwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State in relation to the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, and secondly in paragraph 2 of your Excellency’s reply. The original wording of this paragraph, in the form to which His Majesty’s Government in the Dominions had agreed, ran as follows “ It is understood that His Britannic Majesty retains the right in respect of each of the Dominions mentioned above of withdrawing separately from the exist ing treaties between His Majesty and the Shah of Persia.” The object of this provision was to ensure that the Dominions retained for the future the right which they already possessed under article 2 of the Anglo-Persian Commercial Convention of 1903, and paragraph 3 of the Anglo-Persian Commercial Agreement of 1920, of withdrawing from participation in those instruments. 3. Owing to a misunderstanding due to the extreme haste with which the negotiations for the treaty had to be conducted, this paragraph in the notes as actually signed ran as follows :— “ II est entendu que Sa Majeste britannique reserve le droit, pour chacun des hi tats susmentionnes, de denoncer separement le present traite a la date de son expiration.” It is evident that this wording in no way represents the intentions of His Majesty’s Governments. It is, indeed, meaningless, for the treaty itself was not &amp;igned on behalf of the Dominions and does not apply to them ; it is not possible for His Britannic Majesty to reserve the right to denounce a treaty on behalf of parts of his territories to which that treaty does not apply, nor is it reasonable to refer to the possibility of denouncing something at the date of its expiry when there is nothing to denounce. 4. My Government understand from His Highness the Minister of Court that the Persian Government are not disposed to agree to the rectification of the errorPERSIA— Telegraphs —NO. XXVII—1863. Article 2. The Persian. Government will assign a sum sufficient for the construction of this Telegraph, and for the purchase of such materials as are not procurable in Persia, or can be better obtained in Europe. Article 3. The Persian Government engages to purchase from the English Government all the materials which are better procurable in Europe, and the English Govern ment agrees to supply such materials at moderate prices. • . Article 4. In order that the said line of Telegraph may be well constructed and officially worked, the Persian Government agrees to place it under the superintendence of an English Engineer Officer, who is to be paid by the English Government^ 1 and they further agree to fix a period during which instruction may be given and the line may be brought into good working order ; and his Royal Highness the Itizad-oo-Sultaneh, the Minister of Public Instruction, and His Excellency the Amin-ed-Dowleh, will have cognizance of the aforesaid officer’s proceedings. Article 5. 4 said officer will be fully empowered to call upon the Persian authorities to supply any materials he may consider requisite for this work, and the Persian authorities will make no alterations in his requisitions unless it should be im possible to obtain the thing required. But a Persian officer will accompany him everywhere, so that he may be informed of what is done, and of the prices of the materials ; and the accounts will be audited by the above-mentioned Prince and by the Amin-ed-Dowleh every three months, when a report will be drawn up and printed in the Tehran Gazette. Article 6. tn order to increase the friendship between the two governments, and to promote the above undertaking, the English Government engages to purchase m England, at reasonable rates, with the approval of the Persian Minister Pleni potentiary, the materials required for this work, and to convey them to the Per sian frontier, and to receive from the Persian Government the price paid for the above articles by five instalments in five years after they are delivered on the frontier of Persia. f i ) ' • ' ' - r. ■ t .•• - • • - ’ • . ; ^ . l l,ltl,e handwriting of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs.)

Order of Danebrog, and the First Order of St. Maurice and Lazare, and the First Order of the Saviour of Greece, and the Order of the Polar Star of Sweden, and the Second Order of the Legion of Honour and the First Order of the Osmanieh ; and the aforesaid distinguished representatives, after meeting in the capital of Tehran and perusing and exchanging their full powers which were found in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles:— Article 1. To expedite and facilitate the transmission of international messages, the English Government will, at its own expense and under the superintendence of its own officers, erect a third wire, in addition to the two already in operation between Tehran and Bushire, and will also substitute iron standards for the exist ing wooden poles. The English Government agrees to substitute the above iron standards at the rate of five hundred (500) annually; and the Persian Govern ment engages to pay in ten annual instalments the sum of ten thousand (10,000) tomans to the English Government towards defraying the expenditure incurred on these iron posts. During this work the Persian Government engages itself to render the Superintending Officers every assistance in its power of which they may stand in need. Article 2. Whereas all British subjects in Persia are entitled to the protection of the Persian Government under the operation of Article XII of the Treaty of Paris of March 4th, 1857, it is now provided that the British employes of the Telegraph Department, being charged with public duties, shall be everywhere placed under the special protection of the local authorities, who shall furnish guards when necessary and otherwise assure their personal safety. Article 3. Until the completion of the third wire provided for by the above Article 1, the appropriation of the existing first and second wires for local and international messages shall remain as at present, viz., as retaliated bv Article 8 of tie Convention of the 23rd November 1865,PER ST A— Telegraphs —NO. XXXI—1872. 187 Article 4. .c - • ' ' After the completion of the third wire, notice of which will be given to the Persian Government by the Director of the English Staff, the appropriation of the three wires shall be as follows: The first wire, viz., the one set up originally in 1864, shall be used for locaj traffic, while the second and third wires shall be used for international traffic with the exceptions hereinafter specified in Article 6. Article 5. To prevent any confusion in the working of the different wires, the first wire shall be worked by Persian Government employes and the second and third wires by English Government employes, separate rooms being provided by the Persian Government for the said English and Persian employes in Telegraph Offices con sidered suitable by both administrations. Article 6. (a) Should the first wire be broken at any time, one of the others shall be temporarily lent for Persian correspondence until communication by the first wire is restored, provided always that both the second and third wires are at the time in good working order throughout their length and free from contact. (b) Should the first wire be in contact with either the second or third wire* while the remaining wire is clear, the wire in contact with the first wire shall be insulated, to allow free working by the Persian employes on the first wire, until the contact is removed. (o) Should the first wire be in contact with the second or third, while the remaining one is interrupted, or should both second and third wires be interrupt ed, or should all three wires at any time be in contact, the resultant single line shall be used by the English and Persian administrations in the respective pro portions of two-thirds to one-third of the day, the exact hours to be fixed by mutual agreement between the English and Persian Directors. Article 7. The revenue derived from the local traffic on the Persian wire shall belong entirely to the Persian Government. By local traffic are meant messages origi nating at one Persian station and terminating at another Persian station. Article 8. The Persian Government having already made an arrangement with the Indo- European Telegraph Company regarding the revenue derived from the Indo- European traffic, the English Government will abide by that agreement so far as they are concerned. That is to say, the Persian Government in consideration of a fixed annual payment by the said Company of either twelve thousand (12,000) tomans or of two (2) francs per message of twenty (20) words renounces all claimsi 188 PERSIA— Telegraphs —NO. XXXI—1872. I to any portion of the revenue from transit traffic over the line from Julfa (on the Russian frontier) to Bushire. This revenue shall therefore be divided between the English Government and the Indo-European Company in such manner as they themselves may decide, and the accounts between them shall be settled without the intervention of the Persian Government. As regards international messages originating or terminating in Persia, the Persian Government agrees to cede to the English Governmept, for a term of three (3) years, the entire Persian terminal tax on such messages in considera tion of a fixed annual payment of two thousand (2,000) tomans to be paid to Persia by the English Government. After the three (3) years, the Persian Government shall be free either to accept an annual payment calculated on the basis of two- thirds of the average terminal receipts or to claim two-thirds of the receipts from all bond fide terminal messages. The Persian Government agrees to leave it to. the sense of justice of the English Government to decide which are bond fide ter minal messages and winch are to be considered as transit messages, being for warded to Persia evidently for the purpose of being re-transmitted to other countries. During the time this Treaty remains in force, the Persian Government engages itself to oppose at the International Telegraph conferences any alteration in the present transit and terminal rates, unless a previous agreement with the English Government shall have been made. Article 9. The English Administration being responsible for the correct transmission of all international messages and for the adjustment'of the accounts will collect the payments for these messages according to the rates of the prevailing inter national Telegraph Convention. All international messages originating in Persia shall, before transmission, be registered and sealed by officials appointed by the Persian Government. In ternational messages terminating in Persia shall be delivered to the addressees through the agency of the same officials, who shall be bound to give receipts for such messages to the English Administration. The Persian Administration shall, at all times, have free access to the Eng lish Offices and to all records connected with international traffic. International messages are those which pass over the wires of more than one State. Article 10. The maintenance of the line, including repairs and the appointment, control and payment of the line guards, shall remain in the hands of the English Director and staff. As a contribution towards the expenditure under this head the Persian Gov ernment will pay to the English Director the sum of one thousand (1,000) tomam annually, this amount being deducted from the royalty due to Persia by the Indo-European Telegraph Company as hereinbefore described in Articlei PERSIA— Telegraphs —NO. XXXI—1872. 189 eoitiis it ewe Article 11. The duties of the Telegraph Inspectors and line guards are strictly confined to repairing and maintaining the line. If the line be wilfully damaged the Persian Government will take the most stringent measures to oblige the local authorities to apprehend and punish the offenders. The Governors of districts will be accordingly instructed to pay prompt atten tion to all complaints and communications made to them by the English Officers. Article 12. In case of any wilful damage to the line the expense of repairing the same shall be defrayed by the Persian Government. Article 13. To enable the English Director to have a perfect knowledge of the state of th e wires and offices, and thereby to provide for their general efficiency and the rapid removal of any impediment to telegraphic communication, the orders and regula tions issued by him regarding the connections within the offices and the times and manner of testing the lines shall be strictly obeyed by the Persian Telegraph officers and signallers. Article 14. It having been ascertained that the debt owed by the Persian Government to the English Government on account of materials and erection of the second wire, together with some items connected with the erection of the first wire and the payment of line guards, amounted, on the 31st December 1869, to tomans one hundred and fifteen thousand and seventy-nine, krans eight (115,079-8), or forty-seven thousand two hundred and seventeen (47,217) pounds sterling, the English Government agrees to accept payment without interest, in the course of twenty-four (24) years, in twenty-four (24) equal instalments of the same, trom the Indo-European Telegraph Company. Should the aforesaid Indo-European Telegraph Company wish to pay the amount in question sooner, it is at liberty to do so. The English Government shall notify, without delay, to the Persian Govern ment, any instance of failure on the part of the Indo-European Telegraph Com pany in paying the periodical instalments, and will then hold the Persian govern ment responsible for any portion of the debt remaining unpaid. Nothing in this Article is to be considered to invalidate any claim on the Indo- European Telegraph Company which the Persian Government holds in virtue of the concessions granted to the said Company. Article 15, line shall be exempt from customs or other duties in Persia. o190 PERSIA— Telegraphs —NO. XXXI—1872. Article 16. This convention applies specially to the Tehran-Bushire section, but shall apply equally to the Tehran-Khannikeen section, should the English Director, at any time, deem it expedient to resume charge of that portion of the Persian Telegraph. In such a case the tariff of the Tehran-Khannikeen section and the method of account shall be settled by a special arrangement between the English and Per sian Administrations. Article 17. Any disagreement arising between the Telegraph employes of the two Oo7- ernments shall be referred for decision to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Representative at Tehran. Article 18. This convention shall take effect from the day on which its ratifications are exchanged, and shall remain in force until the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, on which date the English Staff shall make over the whole line, in whatever condition it may be at the time, including iron posts and third wire, to the Persian Government, and shall then cease to have any further connection with the Persian Telegraph. Article 19. After the erection of the third wire it shall be competent for the English Gov ernment, at any time before the expiry of this convention, on giving six months notice, to hand over the line, in its existing condition, to the Persian Govern ment, and to withdraw its officers and employes from the country, ceasing from that date to have any further connection with the Persian Telegraph.

With regard to the boundaries of the Telegraph establishment at Jask, in accordance with the information received by the Persian Government and the British Legation, it has been decided as follows under date of the month of Jem- madee A. II. 1304 (February 25th, 1887). That the Telegraph establishment, which is situated at a distance of 300 yards from the point, take possession of 600 yards more to the north of the Telegraph establishment, i.e., 400 yards from the present boundary fence, between which and the Telegraph establishment is a distance of 200 yards, making a total from the end of promontory to the limits of 900 yards ; at the end of these 900 yards a wire boundary will be drawn and the government of Jask shall have no right whatsoever on any account whatever to interfere in the interior of those limits. As the Telegraph establishment well is about 1,000 yards distant from the boundary agreed upon, it is decided that the road and water-way from the well to the place where they meet the limits be protected, and no one shall build upon, destroy, or interfere with them ; and for the preservation of the well itself it is agreed to set aside a space around the well to be walled in at a distance all round of 100 yards from the well. The customs and other buildings of the Persian Government agent must be without the limits above agreed upon and be built on the place agreed upon between Mr. Flinch and the Malek-i-Tajjar. It is agreed that the Telegraph officials and their true, positive, and salaried servants be exempted from customs dues. It is agreed that stores for provisions and the necessaries of existence which are brought from the interior for the Telegraph establishment, such as rice, ghee, wood, etc., and such like be exempt from taxation. It is agreed that if any of the dependents of Jask, other than the true, positive, and salaried servants of the Telegraph establishment, in order to take sanctuary or protection penetrate within the limits, the Telegraph officials shall have no right to protect them ; on the contrary, they should place them without their boundary and hand them over to the government of Jask. Any merchant, native or foreign, who may have shops within the limits must pay the usual customs dues on that which he imports in order to trade, buy, or Sell. A. Nicholson. Ameen-es-Sultan.

A T the beginning of the nineteenth century the Durani empire, extending from Herat to Kashmir and from Balkh to Sind, which had been built up by Ahmad Shah Abdali, remained undivided in the hands of his grandson Zaman Shah. Having incurred the enmity of the powerful Barakzai tribe, Zaman Shah was deposed and blinded by his half-brother Mahmud, who was supported by Fateh Khan and the Barakzai. He eventually died a pensioner of the British Government at Ludhiana. In 1803 Shah Mahmud was driven out by Shuja-ul-Mulk, the younger brother of Zaman Shah; and Shah Shuja was still in pos session of the undivided empire of Ahmad Shah at the time of Mr, Elphinstone’s mission in 1808. This mission was sent for the purpose of concerting with Shah Shuja the means of mutual defence against the threatened invasion of Afghan istan and India by the French in confederacy with the Persians. Ihe mission was well received at Peshawar by Shah Shuja, and resulted in the conclusion of a Treaty of alliance (No. I) in 1809. It was under stood that the stipulations of the second article rendered it incumbent on the British Government to assist Shah Shuja only in the event of an attack by the French and Persians for the purpose of fulfilling the terms of their confederacy, but not if Persia alone should invade Afgha nistan without such a purpose, or in consequence of former enmity oi recent disputes. Mr. Elphinstone had scarcely left Peshawar when news was received that Kabul had been occupied by Shah Mahmud with the aid of Fateh Khan. In 1816, after wandering about for some years, the sport of fortune, now a captive in Kashmir, now the prisoner of Kan jit Singh at Lahore, Shah Shuja found an asylum in British territory at Ludhiana. In the meantime Fateh Khan Barakzai, who was the chief support of Shah Mahmud’s power, incurred his jealousy, and was blinded and (203)204 AFGHANISTAN. slain. The death of Fateh Khan roused the vengeance of the Barakzai clan. Dost Muhammad Khan, one of the youngest of the twenty brothers of Fateh Khan, was foremost in avenging his murder. Shall Mahmud was driven from all his. dominions except Herat, and the whole of Afghanistan was parcelled out among the Barakzai brothers. In the confusion consequent on this revolution Balkh was seized by the Chief of Bokhara, the Derajat by Banjit Singh, and the outlying province of Sind assumed independence. In the partition of Afghanistan, Ghazni fell to the share of Dost Muhammad, but he soon established his supre macy at Kabul also, and thus became the most powerful of the Barakzai Sardars. His half-brother, Kohandil Khan, ruled conjointly with his brothers in virtual independence at Kandahar, while other districts had fallen to other sons of Paindah Khan Barakzai. Shah Kamran, the son of Mahmud, managed to maintain a precarious footing at Herat. He was the last remaining representative of the Sadozai princes in Afghanistan. Kamran was cruel and dissipated, and entirely ruled by his minister, Yar Muhammad Khan Alakozai. Shah Shuja had still a strong party in Kabul, and never lost hope of recovering his kingdom. With this view he concluded a treaty with Banjit Singh m 1833, marched through Sind, where he defeated the Amir, and advanced on Kandahar, which he temporarily occupied. Heie, houevei, lie was signally defeated by Dost Muhammad, and again fled to his asylum at Ludhiana. During the distractions which followed on these events, Banjit Singh possessed himself of the valley of Peshawar. Boused by the aggressions of the Sikhs, Dost Muhammad resolved on declaring a religious war on them. He assumed the title of Amir-ul-Mummin and called on all true followers of Muhammad to jom m his expedition. With an immense army he advanced to the es aval wdle^ , but Banjit Singh sowed treason in the camp and the army melted away. Thus Peshawar was lost to the Amir. It had long been the policy of the British Government to raise a miner m Persia to the invasion of India by France or Bussia from T j ’Y* 11 no nieans been spared to increase the influence of the is i a e couit of lehran. By her conquests in the north, however, resulting m the treaty* of Turkmanchai m 1828, Bussia was enabled 1 ^ a ^ f ’ ei1 anc y in 1 ersia, which she employed to encourage the claims of the Shah to sovereignty over Herat and western Afghanistan. In November 1837 Muhammad Shah, King of Persia, laid siege to mat, m pursuance of Ins ambitious policy for the re-conquest of vj a f 11 an ' ,' as on occasion that Herat sustained the memo- ^r 11 ' Sleg6, and a11 the efforts of the Shah to capture it, aided by the advice and direction of Bu ssian officers, were defeated. * See Part I, Persia—Appendix No. VIT.maammama AFGHANISTAN. 205 W^hen the Persian army appeared before Herat, Dost Muhammad Khan was not disinclined to welcome a power from which he expected support in his designs against the Sikhs and in In's attempts to recover Peshawar. Meanwhile Lord Auckland had sent a mission to Kabul under Captain Burnes. The mission was professedly a commercial one, but had also in view the checking of the advanc e of Persia and the establishment of peace between the Amir and Kan jit Singh. Dost Muhammad, however, was unable to obtain from the envoy the assurance, which he hoped for, of the good offices of the British Government in procuring the restoration of Peshawar; and he therefore turned to the Russians, from whom he hoped to obtain greater advantages than from an English alliance. To check these aggressive measures on the part of Persia and Russia, the British Government of India determined to interpose a friendly power in Afghanistan between their frontier and Persia, by re-establishing the Sadozai dynasty at Kabul and maintaining the independence of Herat as a separate State. It was believed that Shah Shuja would be welcomed by a powerful party in Kabul, to whom the Barakzai rule was odious. The restoration of the exiled monarch was resolved on, and with this object the tripartite treaty of Tune 1838 (see Punjab, Volume I) between the British Government, Ranjit Singh and Shah Shuja was executed. In May 1839 Shah Shuja was crowned at Kandahar, and shortly afterwards Dost Muhammad surrendered and was carried a prisoner into India. The welcome, however, which was expected for Shah Shuja from the people was not given. He was supported entirely by British bayonets. Insurrections soon broke out, which ended in the destruction of the small British force at Kabul and the murder of Shah Shuja. These disasters were retrieved by Generals Pollock and Nott who, with avenging armies, forced their way, the one by the Khyber Pass, and the other from Kandahar by Ghazni, to Kabul. Having vindicated the honour of the British arms, the British army evacuated Afghanistan. Dost Muham mad was released and permitted to return to Kabul, and the Afghans were left to form any government they might choose. The tripartite treaty between the British Government, Ranjit Singh and Shah Shuja contained a clause guaranteeing the integrity of Herat; and, on the entry of the British troops into Afghanistan, Eldred Pottin- ger, through whose military talents and energy the efforts of the Shah of Persia to take Herat had been defeated, was appointed Political Agent. V ar Muhammad, however, chafed under the restrictions which the British mission placed on his tyranny, more particularly on his traffic in slaves. He made secret overtures to Persia and to the Kanda har Sardars, who had taken refuge in Persia, for a league to expel Shah Shuja and the British from Kabul. Another Agent, Major D’Arcy Todd, was sent to Herat in 1839 under instructions from the envoy at Kabul to negotiate an alliance with Shah Kamran. In June 1839MHH 206 AFGHANISTAN. Articles (No. II) were given to Yar Muhammad, acknowledging him as Minister of Herat and the channel of all communications with Shah Kamran; and in August a Treaty (No. Ill) of per petual peace and friendship was concluded, the terms of which were that the British Government should abstain from interference in the internal administration of Herat, and assist Kamran with money and officers against all foreign encroachment; and that Kamran should prohibit the sale of his subjects into slavery; should refrain from enter ing into hostilities or political correspondence with any foreign power except with the consent of the British Government, to whose arbitration all disputes with Shah Shuja were to he referred; should employ no Europeans except subjects of Great Britain; and should facilitate trade. Within a few weeks after the treaty was signed Yar Muhammad was detected in renewed intrigues, offering to put Herat under the protection of Persia, and urging the Shah to join in a league for the expulsion of the English from Afghanistan. His insolent treatment of the mission compelled Major Todd to withdraw, and to suspend the subsidy of Rs. 25,000 a month which was being paid to Herat. The envoy at Kabul earnestly urged the advance of a force to punish the Wazir for his trea- chery; hut this did not meet Lord Auckland’s views, who disavowed Major Todd’s proceedings. Shortly afterwards the disasters occurred at Kabul which ended in the evacuation of Afghanistan. No sooner was Yai Muhammad relieved of all apprehension of the interference of the British Government than he strangled his sovereign, Shah Kamran, usurped the government of Herat, and professed himself a dependent of Persia. This was in 1842. During the second Punjab war Dost Muhammad descended from Kabul and re-occupied the Peshawar valley; but, after the final overthrow of the Sikhs at the battle of Gujrat, he retreated beyond the Khyber on the approach of the British troops. For several ' vears thereafter there was no intercourse bfetween the British Government and the Amir; but the Amir did not cease to incite the hill tribes on the Peshawar iQ-n^-u 1 t0 i ann ° y tlie Britisl1 Government bv perpetual hostilities. In 1850 he added Balkh to his dominions. Yar Muhammad, whose policy maBl ^ a ^ n himself in real independence while soothing the Shah of 1 ersia by empty acknowledgments of allegiance, died in 1851 and was succeeded by his son Saiyid Muhammad Khan. In 1854 Dost Muhammad Khan, finding himself weakened bv tl antagonism of his brothers in Kandahar, and by the interference c Persia, deputed his son, Ghulam Haidar Khan, to Peshawar, where, i “ 1 . 855 ’ a Treat y (N°- IY) was concluded, stipulating that thei s on hi be peace between the British Government and the Amir; tin eacli should respect the territories of the other; and that the friends an i' AFGHANISTAN. 207 enemies of the British Government should be the friends and enemies of Kabul. After the treaty had been concluded and signed, Ghulam Haidar Khan intimated that it was the intention of his father’s government to send troops to occupy Dawar in the Tochi. This valley, together with other lands, cis and trans-Indus, had been relinquished by Shah Shuja to the Sikh Government; and, after the annexation of the Punjab, the British Government had a right to such tracts. But the right had never been asserted, and the Governor-General consented to the Amir’s occupying Dawar on his own behalf. This, however, was never done. Saiyid Muhammad Khan of Herat was deposed in 1855 by Muham mad Yusaf, grandnephew of Shah Zaman, Shah Shuja and Shah Mahmud. Thus the Sadozai family w T as once more restored at Herat. At this time Dost Muhammad, having quarrelled with his brothers, took possession of Kalat-i-Ghilzai, and soon afterwards, in January 1856, of Kandahar. His ambition, however, was directed to the reduction of Herat, which he had always considered to be an integral part of the Afghan dominions. Dreading the advance of Dost Muhammad, Muhammad Yusaf threw himself on the support of Persia, declared himself to be a vassal of the Shah, and offered to issue coin and have prayers read in the Shah’s name. He invited the assistance of a Persian army; but, when it advanced, found himself threatened both from east and west with the loss of his independence. Accordingly he hoisted the British flag at Herat and declared himself a subject of the British Government. This proceeding was repudiated by Lord Canning in the name of the Queen’s Government, as a presumptuous and dishonest act. Muhammad \ usaf was soon after deposed by a faction in Herat headed by Isa Khan, and sent a prisoner to the Persian camp. The aggression of Persia on Herat, coupled with the insults which had been offered to the British mission at Tehran, led to the declaration of war between England and Persia in 1856. Measures were immediately taken to subsidise Dost Muham mad, who had consulted the British Government, and to encourage him to advance against the Persians. The result was the conclusion of an Agreement (No. Y) in January 1857, confirming the treaty of 1855. Stipulations were made for the payment of a subsidy by the British Government to the Amir to enable him to strengthen his frontier, and for the deputation of British officers to Kandahar during the contin uance of the Persian war, to see that the subsidy was appropriated to the object in view, as well as for the residence at Kabul and Peshawai respectively of a native envoy of the British and Kabul Governments. Assistance in money was also sent to Isa Khan at Herat; but, befoie it reached him, he had been compelled to surrender to the Persians, who took possession of the city in October 1856 and created him W ozir or the Province on behalf of the Shah. He was murdered within a few weeks by a party of Persian soldiers, T 2w 208 AFGHANISTAN. By the treaty* of Paris concluded between England and Persia in 1857, the Persians were required to evacuate Herat. Before they withdrew they installed Sultan Ahmad Khan, better known by the name of Sultan Jan, as ruler of Herat, and the British Government did not refuse to recognise him as de facto ruler. This Chief was a nephew and son-in-law of Dost Muhammad. On the occupation of Kandahar by the Amir he had fled to Persia, where he was well received. He was sup posed to be unfriendly to the British Government; and, although relieved of the presence of a Persian army, he observed all the outward forms of dependence on the Shah. In consequence of a quarrel with Muhammad Sharif Khan, the Governor of Farrah, who was one of Dost Muhammad s sons, Sultan Jan made an expedition against Farrah, which surrendered to him in March 1862. The Amir of Kabul imme diate! v collected his forces to revenge this aggression. He re-took I arrah in June, and in July laid siege to Herat. After a siege of ten months, during which Sultan Jan died, the Amir took Herat by storm in May 1863. Having thus restored the western boundary of the Sadozai dominions, Dost Muhammad died in the following June. He was succeeded in the government of Kabul by his third son Sher Ali Khan, who placed his own third son Muhammad Yakub Khan in charge of Herat, and marched towards Kabul. A struggle for power at once arose among the numerous sons left by Dost Muhammad Khan. Early in 1864 Amir Sher Ali, who had previously been recognised by the British Government, sent an envoy to India to negotiate a new treaty, to apply for aid in warlike materials, and to obtain the recognition of his eldest son Muhammad Ali Khan as heir-apparent. It was held that no new treaty was necessary, as the one concluded with Dost Muhammad Khan was still in force; and the envoy returned to Kabul without waiting for an answer to the other requests. Meanwhile, civil war in Afghanistan continued. Sher Ali, whose eldest son Muhammad AH Khan was killed in the course of if, held his own until 1866 when he was defeated by Abdur Rahman Khan, son of Muhammad Afzal Khan the eldest son of Dost Muhammad, and fled to erat. Muhammad Afzal Khan, who had been imprisoned at Ghazni by Sher All, was released and proclaimed Amir. Throughout these events the British Government maintained a policy of strict neutrality: no an was gi\en to any party, and the Afghans were left to settle their own quarrels. Muhammad Afzal Khan having thus become de facto ruler of Kabul and Kandahar, was recognised as such by the British Government, which also declared, m pursuance of the policy of neut rality, its determination See Part I, Persia, No. XVIII,Mmammmmmmmmmmmmmrn AFGHANISTAN. 209 to acknowledge Slier All Khan as ruler of Herat as long as he maintained himself there and preserved his friendship for the British Government. Muhammad Afzal Khan died in 1867, and was succeeded by his brother Muhammad Azim Khan, second son of Dost Muhammad, who was recognised as Amir of Kabul and Kandahar by the British Government. Not disheartened by frequent reverses, Slier Ali busied himself ir preparations to renew the struggle. In April 1868 Kandahar fell to the forces of his son Muhammad Yakub Khan. Later on Sher Ali himself marched on Kabul; Muhammad Azim, deserted by his troops, fled to Turkistan, and Sher Ali entered Kabul in triumph in September 1868. The British Government regarded with satisfaction the re-establish ment of a consolidated administration in Afghanistan; and, in order to strengthen the Amir’s authority and enable him to meet the more pres sing demands on the exhausted revenues of the country, practical assistance in the shape of a gift of six lakhs of rupees and 6,000 stand of arms was afforded to him. In the meantime Muhammad Azim and Abdur Rahman had col lected their forces and marched from Turkistan on Kabul. A decisive engagement took place at Tinah Khan in January 1869, which resulted in a complete victory for the Amir. His opponents fled to the Waziri hills and finally reached Persia. Muhammad Azim Khan diea on his way to Tehran in October 1869. Immediately after his restoration to power, Sher Ali had ex pressed a wish to have an interview with the Viceroy, Sir John Lawrence. The troubles in Turkistan prevented for a time the fulfilment of this intention; but, on the defeat of Muhammad Azim Khan, the proposal was renewed and an interview between the Amir and the Lari of Mayo, Sir John Lawrence’s successor, took place at Ambala in March 1869. The Amir was informed on this occasion that, while the British Government had no desire to interfere in the internal affairs of Kabul, yet they would view with severe displeasure any attempt on the pait of the Amir’s rivals to disturb his position and re-kindle civil war. The Amir returned to Kabul in April 1869, taking with him as a further present from the British Government a sum of six lakhs of lupees and two batteries of artillery. Por many years the title to the possession of Sistan had been in dis pute between Persia and Afghanistan, and Persia had more than once invited the interference of the British Government, notably so at the time of Amir Dost Muhammad Khan’s recovery of Herat in 1863. At that juncture the British Government were not prepared to interfere : and the Persian Government were informed that it must be left to both parties to make good their possession by force of arms. As Persia was210 AFGHANISTAN. bound by Article 6 of the Treaty of 1857 (see Part I, Persia, No. XYIIl) not to take up arms against Afghanistan without first inviting the friendly offices of the British Government, the effect of this refusal to interfere was to authorise an appeal to arms. Since then the Persians had occupied a considerable portion of Sistan. Consequently distur bances and raids on both sides of the border took place, which were most injurious to the prosperity of the country and to the subjects of both the claimants inhabiting the neighbouring provinces. At length both Governments agreed to refer the question of the sovereignty and boundaries of the whole of Sistan on both sides of the river Helmand to the arbitration of the British Government, on the understanding that both ancient right and recent possession were to be taken into considera tion. It was also agreed that the final decision of the British Govern ment should be binding on both parties. Accordingly, in the spring of 1872, commissioners on behalf of the paities concerned and the British Government assembled in Sistan, examined the lands in dispute, and heard the evidence produced on both sides. An award* was finally pronounced by Major-General Goldsmid, the chief of the mission, which, after some demur, was eventually ac cepted by Persia and Afghanistan and confirmed bv the British Govern ment (see Part I, Persia). From this period the relations between Amir Sher Ali and the British Government became gradually more and more cold and con strained. In the course of 1878 matters came to a crisis. In July of that year a Russian mission was honourably received in Kabul. The o\eminent of India thought it necessary to insist upon a similar recep- ion emg acioided to a British mission, and preparations were accord- in&amp; p Hiade foi the despatch of a party of British and Indian officers of rank; but on the 21st September 1878, by the Amir’s orders, his officers a.

An ultimatum was accordingly addressed to him, threatening him with war unless, by the 20th November, he signified his willingness to comply with the demands of the British Government. No answer having been received by the prescribed date, British troops crossed the frontier on the 21st November by three main lines of advance, via Kandahar, the Kurram and the Khyber. The Afghans were everywhere defeated, the principal action of the campaign being fought at the Paiwar Kotal on the 2nd December. Shortly after this engagement Sher Ali, with the remaining members of the Russian mission, fled from his capital towards Turkistan, leaving his son Yakub Khan as regent at Kabul. Communications passed between Yakub and the British officers, but the British troops continued to advance till, towards the end of January 1879, they were in military occupation of a great part of Afghanistan. News having been received that Sher Ali had died at Mazar-i-Sharif in February 1879, negotiations were opened with Yakub Khan, which ended in the Treaty of Gandamak (No. VI), signed in May. This provided, amongst other things, that the districts of Kurram, Sibi and Pishin should be assigned districts, and should remain under British administration, any surplus of revenue over expenditure being handed over to the Amir. It was also arranged that the British Government should retain the control of the Khyber and Michni passes, and of all relations with the independent tribes inhabiting the territory diiectly connected with those passes. Article 4 of the treaty further provided for the residence at Kabul of a British Agent ; and Sir Louis Cavagnari, accompanied by Biitish officers and a suitable escort, was appointed to this post. He held it till the lamentable outbreak of the 3rd September 1879, when he and nearly all the Residency staff and establishment were massacred by the mutinous regiments in the Amir’s service. The British forces were once more put in motion to avenge this outrage, and before the close of October were again in military occupa tion of a great part of Afghanistan. Yakub Khan having voluntarily abdicated after this signal proof of his inability to control his ovn rebel lious subjects, the British Government undertook the task of establishing som® stable administration in the country. Yakub Khan asked to be sent to India: and in December 1879 he left Kabul. He was first sent to Meerut, and thence to Dehra Dun, where he resided until his. death in 1923. After full consideration it was deemed advisable to erect Kandahar and its dependencies into a separate principality, of which Saidai Shei212 AFGHANISTAN. \li, a Barakzai of Kandaliar, was recognised as the Wali or Chief. No special arrangements were necessary for Herat, where Ayub Khan, brother of the e^r-Amir Yakub Khan, and Governor of that province during his short reign, still maintained himself in power. It was deter mined to retain Kabul itself temporarily under direct British adminis tration, until its future government could be settled on some basis which should have a reasonable prospect of finality. In the spring of 1880 Abdur Rahman Khan, who had long been a refugee in Russian territory, made his appearance, with a considerable body of followers, in Afghan Turkistan, where he was cordially welcomed by the leading Chiefs, and succeeded in establishing his authority on the northern side of the Hindu Kush. He had a few adherents of note in Afghanistan proper, more especially in Kohistan: and, from his known character and reputation for ability, there seemed reason to believe that he might, with the countenance^ of the British Government, be able to establish himself more firmly on the throne of Kabul than any of the other possible candidates. Negotiations were accordingly entered into with him: and, though he made at first some attempts to raise the country and to assert his position as Amir of Afghanistan in his own right, he readily accepted the position offered to him by the Government of India, namely that of Amir of Kabul, the Kandahar province being severed from Kabul and made into a separate principality. Matters having been satisfactorily settled, he was formally recognised as Amir at a Darbar held at Kabul on the 22nd July 1880. On the 31st July and the following day a conference was held at Zimma, at which the wishes and intentions of the British Government were fully explained to him. No formal treaty was drawn up, but it was understood that he was to be assisted with arms and money by the Government of India to such an extent as might appear to them to be necessary; that he was to be recognised by them as Amir of Kabul and is. epen encies, that he might take such measures as he pleased to bnng Herat under his control, but was not to interfere with the Wali of Kandahar; that Pishin, Sibi and Kurram were to be no longer re- gar e as part of Afghanistan; that the British Government were to control the Michni and Khyber passes and all relations with the inde pendent hill tribes m the territory directly attached thereto; and that me foreign relations of Kabul were henceforth to be conducted subject to the approval of the Government of India. No mention was made at the time of Khost; but, at the Amir’s request, he was allowed a few months later to take possession of the district. The Amir arrived at Kabul on the 11th August 1880: and the same m • T^ 1 farewe11 inter view between him and the chief British o cials, the last of the British troops evacuated Kabul and returned nei o es a war y the Khyber route. A strong division had started a few ,days previously to march through Ghazni and Kalat-i-Ghilzai toAFGHANISTAN. 213 Kandahar, which was at this time invested by Ayub Khan with an army from Herat. Ayub, after much vacillation and prolonged preparation, had started from Herat in the preceding- June with the intention of annexing Kanda har to his own principality. On the 27th July he met and defeated at Maiwand a British force which had been selit out to check his further progress. As he advanced on Kandahar he was joined by large num bers of tribesmen, and the garrison of that city was shut up within the walls, till the arrival, on the 31st of August, of the relieving force under General Roberts, who, on the following day, attacked and com pletely defeated Ayub Khan. The Sardar fled across the Helmand to Herat, whither it was not thought necessary to follow him. The course of events had made it quite clear that the Wall, Slier Ali, could not hope to maintain himself at Kandahar without the assistance of British troops, whom it was impossible to keep there for an indefinite period. He was accordingly allowed, at his own request, to retire to British India on a pension : and the Government of India offered the Kandahar province to Amir Abdur Rahman. He was not at first ready to accept the offer, urging want of arms, ammunition and transport : but eventually arrangements were made in accordance with which, in April 1881, the city was finally evacuated by British troops, and for mally made over to a governor deputed from Kabul. During the following summer Kandahar became temporarily subject to Ayub Khan, who again advanced from Herat, and succeeded for the time in expelling the Amir’s deputy. In September 1881 he was once more defeated by a force from Kabul, who followed up their success by advancing on Herat, and occupying it after dispersing Ayub’s army. Ayub Khan himself fled to Persia, where he remained under surveillance until the summer of 1887, when he escaped from Tehran, and made his way to the Afghan frontier. He was, however, prevented from crossing the border by the prompt action taken by the Amir’s authorities in Herat. After undergoing great hardship in the Persian desert, he eventually surrendered to General MacLean in November 1887, and was sent to India, with a very large following, in the ensuing January. He undertook to live in India and never to do anything contrary to the wishes of the British Government, who provided him and his principal followers with liberal pensions. He was sent first to Rawalpindi, and later to Lahore, where he resided till his death in 1914. In 1883 Amir Abdur Rahman Khan received an annual subsidy of twelve lakhs of rupees from the Government of India. In April 1885 the Amir visited India and met the Viceroy, Lord Dufferin, at Rawalpindi, where general assurances of friendship and good-will were exchanged.214 AFGHAN IS IAN. One of the most important events in the reign of Amir Abdur Rah- man Khan was the delimitation of the north-western frontier of Afghanistan. As far back as 18G9, in the reign of Amir Sher Ali Khan, negotiations for the purpose of defining the frontier had been begun between the British and Russian Governments. The proposals of the British Government were met by counter-proposals bv the Russian Government : and eventually, in 1872, the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, under instructions from Earl Granville, submitted to the Russian Government the following statement of the territories which the British Government considered as fully belonging to Afghanistan: — (1) Badakshan with its dependent district of Wakhan from the Sari- kul 0 °d s Lake) on the east to the junction of the Kokcha river with the Oxus (or Penjah) forming the northern boundary of this Afghan province throughout its entire extent. (-) Afghan Turkistan, comprising the districts of Kundnz, Khulm and Balkh, the northern boundary of which would be the line of the Oxus from the junction of the Kokcha river to the post of Khoja Saleh in clusive, on the highroad from Bokhara to Balkh. Nothing to be claimed by the Afghan Amir on the left bank of the Oxus below Khoja Saleh. J (3) The internal districts of Akcha, Sar-i-pul, Maim ana, Shibarghan and Andkhui, the latter of which would be the extreme Afghan frontier possession to the north-west, the desert beyond belonging to independent tribes of Turcomans. (4) The Western Afghan frontier between the dependencies of Herat and those of the Persian Province of Khorasan was well known and need not be defined. rv, ^”* n ? e t7oiti hakoff, on behalf of his Government, questioned whether the Amir exercised actual sovereignty over Wakhan and Badakhshan. In regard to the north-western boundary he stated that the Russian m ormation threw doubt upon the Afghan possession of Akcha, Sar-i- pul, Maimana, Shibarghan and Andkhui; but added that, if the English Government adhered to its opinion as to the expediency of including these places in Afghan territory, Russia would be disposed, as far as is poition of the boundary was concerned, to accept the line laid down by the British Government. In January 1873 the British Government again represented the grounds on which they based their contention : and this elicited a reply from Prince Gortchakoft that while, according to Russian view;, Badakhshan and U akhan still enjoyed a certain degree of independence, yet, as it was not desired to attach too great an importance to this detail, we do not refuse to accept the line of boundary laid down bv England”.k manmmmttmmmmmm AFGHANISTAN. 215 This somewhat vague settlement, historically known as the Claren- don-Gortcliakoff Agreement of 1872-73, was concluded without any reference to the Amir. During the next seven or eight years, the Russian Government con tinued to advance slowly but unceasingly from the Caspian in the direc tion of Merv, and frequent reports were received of their occupation of that place. Accordingly, in February 1882, Earl Granville suggested the demarcation of the Russo-Persian frontier from Baba Durmaz to the point where the Russian frontier meets that of Afghanistan in the vicinity of the Hari Rud, and threw out a suggestion that something might be done with regard to the adjacent Afghan frontier, certain details of which had been left unsettled by the Clarendon-Gortchakoff Agreement. Numerous communications passed between the two Gov ernments, but without decisive result, until in February 1884, wdiile the question was still under consideration, official information was received that the Merv Turkmans had made their submission to Russia, and that the Czar had determined to accept them as his subjects. Upon this a memorandum was despatched to the British Ambassador at St. Peters burg for communication to the Russian Government, in which it was observed that the occupation of Merv seemed entirely inconsistent with the hitherto uniform assurances of the Russian Government that they had no intention of occupying the place. In their reply (March 1884), the Russian Government, after explain ing their action in this connection, added that, if the British Govern ment should find it useful and practicable to complete the arrangements previously concluded between the two Governments by a more exact definition of the countries separating the Russian possessions from Afghanistan, Russia could only repeat its proposal of 1882, to continue from Khoja Saleh westward the line of demarcation agreed upon in 1872-73. The British Government accepted this proposal (April 1884) and suggested the appointment of a joint commission, to begin operations in the ensuing autumn. Considerable correspondence ensued as to the point from which the commission should begin its labours; the basis of the delimitation; and the principles upon which the instructions to the commission should be framed. Eventually it was arranged that General Sir Peter Lumsden, the British commissioner, and General Zelenoi, the Russian commis sioner, should meet at Sarakhs about the 13th October 1884. Sir Peter Lumsden duly arrived from England on the frontier, and joined his escort which had been sent to meet him from India. But it now appeared that there were difficulties in the way of the demarcation. 1 irst, news was received that the Russian commissioner was ill and unable to start, and then the Russian Government took exception to216 AFGHANISTAN. Sarakhs as the place of meeting, suggesting Pul-i-Khatun or some other spot south of Sarakhs. Next, a proposal was put forward that a zone should be agreed upon between the two Governments, within which the commissioners should be instructed to limit their explorations. Meantime winter was coming on apace, and the Russians had already advanced on and occupied Pul-i-Khatun on the Hari Rud and Pul-i-Khishti on the Murghab. Shortly before this, Afghan troops had occupied Panjdeh, and the Russian Ambassador had called the very serious attention of the British Government to the fact. The British commission had (December 1884) settled down in winter quarters at Bala Murghab, and the Russians intimated that there would be still further delay in the arrival of their commissioner. The question of the zone of enquiry was still being discussed in England, when, in March 1885, a Russian force attacked and defeated a considerable Afghan force at Pul-i-Khishti near Panjdeh. The British commission, which was camped a few miles from the scene of conflict, immediately retired to Tirpul on the Hari Rud. At this critical moment, the Amir was in India on his visit to the Viceroy at Rawalpindi. War was averted, and negotiations w’ere resumed in London. Sir Peter Lumsden was summoned to England to help in the negotiations there, and the charge of the mission devolved upon Colonel Sir Wbst Ridgeway. It was not, however, until the following September that final arrangements (No. VII) for the demarcation were agreed to between the two Govern ments. Two months later the joint commission met as arranged at Zulfikar. I he work of demarcation was started immediately, and good progress had been made when a severe winter drove both parties into winter quarters shortly after Christmas. Work was resumed in March 1886: and in June the frontier was definitely fixed and pillars were constructed from Zulfikar on the Bari Rud to the meridian of Dukchi, a group of wells north of Andkhui and within 40 miles of the Oxus. Unfortunately the joint commission found it impossibe to come to an agreement as to the spot at which the frontier line should enter the cultivated tracts in the vicinity of the river, or actually meet the river. It is true that all the old papers bearing on the subject had spoken of Khoja Saleh being the frontier; but no place on the river could now be found wdiich both sides would admit to be the Khoja Saleh of the agree ment of 18 &lt;2-73. Accordingly, the commission dissolved itself at Khamiab at the beginning of September 1886, and the British party returned to India i}ia Kabul, where they were honourably entertained by the Amir for about a week.AFGHANISTAN. 217 The frontier line agreed to up to Dukchi is described in a Protocol (No. YTII) signed by the joint commissioners at Khamiab in September 1886. In the following year Sir West Ridgeway was deputed to St. Peters burg to resume negotiations for the completion of the unsettled part of the boundary. Eventually a settlement was arrived at by mutual con cessions. Afghanistan restored to the Sarik Turkmans most of the land of which they had been deprived between the Khushk and Murghab rivers, and Russia withdrew her claims to all the districts then in pos session of the Afghans on the Oxus, and to the wells and pastures neces sary for the prosperity of the Uzbegs of Afghan Turkistan. The final protocol (No. IX), embodying this settlement, was signed in July 1887. In January 1888 Majors Yate and Peacocke completed the demarca tion of the revised portion of the frontier between the Khushk and the Murghab and between Dukchi and the Oxus. A description of the line of pillars is given in an Appendix.* While the British commission was in the vicinity of Herat a local dispute regarding the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan in the Hashtadan valley was brought to notice. The locality, which is not far from Kuhsan, was visited and the conflicting claims were mapped. After protracted correspondence, both the Shah and the Amir consented to refer the question to the decision of the Viceroy upon the report of Major-General MacLean, the Agent to the Governor-General for Khorasan. General MacLean proposed a compromise which was accepted by both sides and duly carried into effect by demarcation on the spot during the months of March, April and May 1891. The synopsis of boundary pillars demarcating the line as finally determined is given as an Appendix.t In the autumn of 1888 the Amir’s cousin Muhammad Ishak Khan, Governor of Turkistan, after having for several years evaded accepting repeated invitations to Kabul, threw off his allegiance, proclaimed him self Amir and marched on Kabul with the whole of the Turkistan army. He was, however, completely defeated by the Amir’s forces at Ghaznighak near Haibak in September 1888. Sardar Ishak Khan fled to Samarkand, where he was granted a small allowance by the Russian Government. Complaints having been made by the Russian Government in 1891 and 1892 about the irrigation by the Afghans of lands on the left bank of the Kushk, by canals taking off from that stream, in contravention of the terms of the Afghan Boundary Commission Protocol of Jnly 1887, the Government of India addressed the Amir of Afghanistan in the * Appendix No. I. t Appendix No. II.AFGHANISTAN. matter. He denied having authorised his subjects to depart in any way from the terms of the protocol of 1887 : and suggested a joint enquiry to ascertain which side had perpetrated a breach of the agreement. The British Government thereupon addressed the Russian Government, proposing a joint enquiry on the spot by a Russian and Afghan repre sentative and a British officer. The Russian Government agreed to the proposal on the condition that immediate effect should be given to the commission s award in the presence of the commissioners. Lieutenant- Colonel C. E. Yate was deputed to the Kushk valley as British com missioner. The Russian Government appointed M. Ignatiew as its commissioner. These commissioners along with the Amir’s representa tive held a local enquiry. The proceedings of the joint commission were recorded in six protocols. The first protocol* recorded the result of ilie inspection of the locality by the joint commissioners, and the sixth protocol (No. X) recorded the settlement arrived at by the joint commissioners. Effect was given on the spot to the decision of the joint commission. 'In 1893 Lord Lansdowne sent his Foreign Secretary, Sir Mortimer uiami, on a mission to Kabul. For some time past communications had been going on between the British and Russian Governments re. gar( ing the British and Russian spheres of influence on the Pamirs, and about the Clarendon-Gortehakoff agreement of 1872-73, making the river Oxus the north-eastern boundary of Afghanistan up to Lake Victoria (Sankul). This boundary had been fixed at the time of the agreement on insufficient information: and it had subsequently been discovered that Shighnan and Roshan, portions of which lie to the no! ° t e Oxus, formed part of Badakshan, a province belonging to the Amir of Afghanistan, while the district of Darwaz, the greater portion of which lies to the south of the river, was tributary to Bokhara. 7^0 Claimed the literal ^fil™ent of the agreement ot and, m order to explain clearly to the Amir the terms of . »agreement, and the extent of the Russian claim, which involved glian withdrawal from trans-Oxus Shighnan and Roshan, it had ecome necessary to depute a British officer to Kabul.

By the other agreement a thoroughly friendly understanding was arrived at as regards the Indo- Afghan fiontier. The Amir retained Asmar and was given the Birmal valley. Also, to mark their sense of the friendly spirit in which the Amir had entered into the negotiations, the Government of India raised his subsidy to eighteen lakhs of rupees a year, granted him full permis sion to import munitions of war, and promised him some help in this respect as a gift. On the other hand, the Amir agreed that the eastern and southern frontiers of his dominions, from Wakhan to the Persian border, should follow the line shown in the map attached to the agree ment, and that he would at no time exercise interference in Swat, Bajaur, or Chitral. His Highness also relinquished his claim to Chagai. Besides the two above agreements the Amir received from Sir Mortimer Durand a letter, dated the 11th November 1893 (No. XIII), informing him that the assurance given to him by the British Govern ment in regard to his territory, when he had come to the throne in 1880, remained still in force and was applicable to any territory which might come into his possession in consequence of his agreement with the British Government regarding the upper Oxus frontier. The work of demarcation of the Indo-Afghan frontier as defined in the agreement of November 1893 was divided into sections, and was carried out for the most part by joint commissions during the years 1894-1896, the only portion of the frontier remaining undemarcated being a small section in the vicinity of the Mohmand country and the Khyber. The Afghan-Waziristan boundary from Domandi to Laram was demarcated by British officers at the special request of the Amir. The Agreement regarding 1 the Afghan-Kurram frontier was con cluded (No. XIV) in November 1894: an Agreement concluded in April 1895 (No. XV) defined the boundary line from the Hindu Kush to the neighbourhood of Nawa Kotal: and the Afghan-Baluch boundary from Domandi to the Persian border was demarcated (No. XVI) in 1894 and 1895. In 1894 the Hon. G. N. Curzon (afterwards Lord Curzon of Kedles- ton) visited Kabul on the invitation of the Amir, and‘spent a fortnight there as the Amir’s guest. He was permitted by the Amir to visit Kandahar and to return to India via New Cham an. In 1895 the Amir deputed his second son, Shahzada Nasrulla Khan, to pay his respects to Her Majesty the Queen-Empress, the Amir’s own state of health having prevented him from undertaking a journey to England in person. In March 1895, after prolonged negotiations, Notes (Nos. XVII and XVIII) were exchanged between the British and Russian Governments220 AFGHANISTAN. concluding an agreement in regard to tlie spheres of influence of Great Britain and Russia on the Pamirs, and the demarcation of the boundary line by a joint commission composed of British and Russian delegates The Amir, being informed by the Government of India of the terms of the agreement, expressed his pleasure at the settlement. The settlement arrived at by the joint commission as regards the boundary was recorded in ten protocols. A synopsis of the pillars erected by this settlement is given as an Appendix.* The Amir was furnished by the Government of India with copies of the map signed by General Gerard and General Povalo-Scheikovski, the joint commissioners, together with a descriptiont of the demarcated line showing the boundary of Afghanistan in the direction of Wakhan and the Pamirs. In accordance with the terms of the Anglo-Russian agreement of March 1895, Bokhara evacuated cis-Oxus Darwaz in October 1896. The Amir had retired from trans-Oxus Shighnan and Roshan in 1894 By the agreement arrived at by the Pamir Boundary Commission eastern TV akhan was formally acknowledged by Russia as forming part of the territories of the Amir of Afghanistan. To enable the Amir to carry on properly the administration of this strip of country, the Gov ernment of India granted him an additional subsidy of Rs. 50,000 a year, with effect from the 1st March 1897. In 1890 an Agreement (No. XIX) was concluded regarding the Baluch-Afghan boundary westward from Chaman to the Persian Abdui Rahman died in October 1901 and was succeeded by his eldest son Habibulla, whose succession was undisputed. Towards the end of the life of Abdur Rahman, land and water dis putes between the Persians and Afghans in Sistan began to cause anxiety. The boundary defined by Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award in 1872 was mainly based on natural features, and for a long distance was declared to follow the course of the river Helmand and the margin of the lagoon into which that river poured its waters. During the succeed ing thirty yeais the Uelmand had changed its bed to the west, and the lagoon had assumed a new position. Disputes had from time to time arisen; but till 1901 they had yielded to local settlement. In 1902, ■ ow(per the position had become acute, and the Persian Government invoked the good offices of the British Government under the Treaty of 185, (see Part I. Persia, No. XVIII). The Amir agreed tn *rhitraV.inn border. * Appendix No. IV. t Appendix No. V.AFGHANISTAN. 221 1903 and arrived on the Sistan border in the following month, having been joined on the w’ay by the Afghan commissioner; and in March Colonel McMahon entered Persian Sistan and came into direct com munication with the Persian commissioners. Meanwhile the survey of the whole disputed area was being pushed on, and in November Colonel McMahon formally delivered his boundary award to the Persian and Afghan commissioners. Some delay ensued; but eventually the award was accepted by the Afghan and Persian Governments, and the line from Enh-i-Malik Siah to the Siah Koh was demarcated by pillars along its entire length at the end of December 1904. In February 1905 Colonel McMahon formally delivered to the Persian and Afghan com missioners the final maps and arbitral statements (No. XX) relating to the Sistan boundary, as also the detailed list of the boundary pillars showing the position and nature of each pillar. In November 1904 Mr. L. W. Dane, Foreign Secretary to the Gov ernment of India, was sent on a mission to Kabul. Mr. Dane reached Kabul on the 12th December, and on the 21st March 1905 concluded, on behalf of the British Government, a Treaty (No. XXI) with the Amir Habibulla Khan, continuing the agreements which had existed between the British Government and Abdur Rahman Khan. In December 1904 Amir Habibulla Khan deputed his eldest son, Sardar Inayatulla Khan, to India to pay a visit to the Viceroy. Lord Curzon received the Sardar at Calcutta, and he returned to Kabul in January 1905. The full investigations which had been made during his long stay in Sistan had enabled Colonel McMahon to mature his views regarding the irrigation rights of both Persia and Afghanistan: and, the boundary question having been settled, he called upon the Persian and Afghan commissioners to submit statements of their cases in respect of these rights and, after consideration of their respective representations, he delivered his water award in April 1905 (No. XXII). The Amir accepted the arbitral decision with one reservation; but, up to the end of 1930, the Persian Government had still not notified its acceptance. From the 2nd January to the 7th March 1907, the Amir visited India. On his arrival, with a suite of 1,100 men, he was accorded a salute of 31 guns, and in a telegram of welcome from King Edward he was for the first time addressed as “His Majesty ”. An Anglo-Russian Convention, relating to Persia, Afghanistan and Tibet, was signed at St. Petersburg in August 1907, and ratified in the following month [see Part I, Persia, No. XXI). As regards Afghanis tan, His Majesty’s Government disclaimed any intention of altering the political status or (subject to the observance of the Treaty of 1905) of interfering in the administration, or annexing any territory, of Afgha nistan, and engaged to use her influence in Afghanistan in no manner222 AFGHANISTAN. threatening to Russia. Russia, on her part, recognised Afghanistan as outside her sphere of influence. The final article stipulated the consent of tlie Amir to the terms of the Convention as a condition precedent to its enforcement of the arrangements. Such consent was, however, never obtained. Tn the summer of 1909 the Amir suggested the appointment of a •Joint Commission for the settlement of various differences between the frontier subjects of the two Governments. A settlement, by way of cancellation and set-off on tribal lines, of the great majority of out standing cases was effected in October. Most of the cases settled related to the Tvurram border, the amount due, on balance, being found to he Rs. 2,685 in favour of the Afghans. This sum was paid by the Govern ment of India. The outbreak of the Great War, and particularly the entry of Turkey into the conflict, placed the Amir in a difficult position. No efforts were spared by the Central Powers to bring Afghanistan into the War. In spite of the formation of a preventive military cordon in East Persia, a German-Turkish mission succeeded in reaching Kabul in October 1915. The Amir summoned a meeting of representatives from all parts of the country, delivered a strong speech in favour of peace and friend ship with the British, and succeeded in keeping his country neutral throughout the Great War. As a token of appreciation of his attitude his subsidy was increased in 1916 by rupees two lakhs a year, making the total rupees twenty and a half lakhs. In February 1919 Amir Habibulla, feeling that the time had come when he might claim the reward of steadfastness throughout the war, and vindicate his policy to his people, wrote to the Viceroy, demanding written recognition by the Peace Conference of Afghanistan’s absolute liberty, freedom of action, and perpetual independence ”. On the night of the 19th/20th Febru ary 1919 Amir Habibulla was muidered at his shooting camp at Qala-i-gush in the Raghman Valiev. His brother Sardar Nasrulla was at Jalalabad at the time. He imme diately pioclaimed himself Amir, Inayatulla, the heir apparent, who was also in Jalalabad, making no attempt to establish his own claim. Tn Kabul Sardar Amanulla, the 2T year old son of Habibulla by the T lya Hazrat, took possession of the citadel. Conciliating the army by promises of increased pay, and disarming opposition by the boldness ot his act, he ordered the arrest of Nasrulla on the charge of having murdered Habibulla, and on the 28th February was proclaimed King of Afghanistan in the presence of all civil and military officials in Kabul. Amanulla s first act on taking over the reins of Government was to proclaim the independence of Afghanistan both in internal and in exter nal affairs. For this purpose he desptached special messengers to Russia, Turkey, Bokhara and Khiva. On the 3rd March he wrote toAFGHANISTAN. 223 the Viceroy, intimating his succession, and emphasising that, in seeking friendship, he did so on behalf of “ our independent and free govern ment of Afghanistan On the 13th April the Amir held a Durbar at which Nasrulla Khan was convicted of having instigated the murder of Habibulla, and was sentenced to imprisonment for life. He died in jail in 1920. A Colonel, held to be actual murderer, was executed, and other persons were awarded imprisonment. These sentences did not, however, satisfy either the public or the army, who doubted whether guilt had been correctly imputed, and resented the action taken against Hasrulla. Confronted with a situation of much difficulty, the Amir summoned the tribal leaders to Kabul, despatched emissaries, money and ammuni tion to the frontier tribes, established touch with revolutionaries in India, and declared a Holy War against the British. Afghan forces were despatched towards the end of April to Dacca, Khost and Kandahar, and acts of war took place in the neighbourhood of Landi Khana on the 3rd and 4th May. On the 5th May orders were issued for the mobilisation of the field army in India. On the 13th May British troops occupied Dacca, where on the 17th May the Afghans suffered considerable casualties and the loss of five Krupp guns. In Chitral they were driven out of Arnawai on the 23rd May with a loss of four guns. The Royal Air Force bombarded Jalala bad on the 19th and 20th May and both Jalalabad and Kabul on the 24th May. On the 27th May a British force occupied Spin Baidak, on the Chaman front, after bombardment. On the isame date General Hadir Khan invested Thai, but was compelled to retire on the 1st June. When, on the 28th May, a letter was received from the Amir, ascribing the outbreak of war to a misunderstanding, and suggesting an armistice, considerable successes had already been gained by British arms in the field, discounted however by the defection of the Khyber Rifles, and by evacuations, followed by desertions of a majority of the Militias, in Waziristan and the Tochi. The Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, replied to the Amir in a letter which refuted the Amir’s version of the causes of the war, stated the terms on which an armistice would be granted, and named Rawalpindi as the venue for a peace conference. On the 8th August 1919, the delegates, chief of whom were Sir Hamil ton Grant and Shahghassi Ali Ahmad Khan, signed the Treaty of Rawalpindi (No. XXIII) whereby peace was established, the previous subsidy, and all arrears of subsidy, were forfeited, and the privilege of importing arms via, India was withdrawn; but prospects were extended of further treaty negotiations after an interval of six months. The Afghan Government further agreed to accept the In do-Afghan224 AFGHAN] SPAN. frontier whicli liad been accepted by Amir Ilabibulla, and to the demar cation of a small area in the Khyber where the first aggressions had taken place during the recent war. Annexed to the treaty, but not published with it at the time, was a letter (annexure to ISTo. XXIII) admitting the independence of Afghanistan in her foreign relations. Between August 23rd and September 2nd demarcation in the vici nity of Torkham was completed* as contemplated in the Rawalpindi Peace Treaty. On the 10th September 1919 the Amir addressed'letters to the Vice roy intimating his pleasure at the restoration of peace; to Sir Hamilton Grant, suggesting a treaty for the establishment and perpetuation of friendship; and, in formal terms, to His Majesty the King. In another letter of the 5th November, addressed to Sir Hamilton Grant as Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province, the Amir proposed an Indo-Afghan Frontier Conference for the discussion and settlement of the whole frontier problem. The Afghan Treaty delegates, headed by Sirdar-i-Ala Mahmud Beg darzi, father-in-law 7 of Amir Amanulla, reached Mussoorie on the 14th April 1920. Four meetings with the British delegates, chief of whom was Mr. H. R. C. Dobbs, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, had been held by the 24th April when the Conference was suspended on account of acts of Afghan aggression on the Chaman, Kurram and Chitral frontiers. On the adjustment of these matters, further meetings took place between the 7th June and 24th July, on which date the Afghan delegates returned to Kabul, taking with them an aide memoire which indicated the terms on which negotiations might lie continued with a view to the conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship. On the 6th October 1920 the Amir addressed the Viceroy, inviting to Kabul ^trustworthy representatives invested with power to conclude a treaty”. The Viceroy accepted this invitation, and on the 7th Jan- uary 1921 a British Mission, headed by Sir Henry Dobbs, arrived at Kabul. _ Meanwhile Sirdar Muhammad Wali Khan, who in October 1919 had arrived m Moscow with a Mission the object of which was to estab lish touch with the chief countries of the world, had been well received by J ,' / ® n ! n * ^% lian Consuls had been appointed to Tehran and Meshed, Afghan Envoys had been established at Andijan, Tashkent and Bokhara, and Suritz had been appointed as Consul of the Fnion of Soviet Socialist Republics at Kabul. Suritz in Kabul and Muhammad Wali Khan in Moscow had initiated conversations with the view to the conclusion of a Russo-Afghan Treaty,! which was eventually signed on the 28th Febru- * Appendix No. VI. + Appendix No. VII.AFGHANISTAN. 225 ary 1921, at Moscow; wliere, on the following day, Muhammad Wall Khan also signed a Treaty of alliance* between Turkey and Afghanistan. In June of the same year a Treaty was concluded between Persia and Afghanistan (see Part I, Persia, Appendix No. XXVI). The Pusso-Afghan Treaty was ratified by the Amir at Kabul on the 14th August 1921, and its terms were communicated to Sir Henry Dobbs on the 3rd September. Under the terms of this Treaty both parties engaged themselves not to enter into any military or political arrangement with a third power which would be detrimental to the other party. Provision was made for the establishment of seven consulates in Hussian territory, of which five were to be in Russian Central Asia, and for Russian Consulates at Herat, Maimana, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kandahar and Ghazni. Goods imported into Afghanistan from Russian territory would not be taxed. The inde pendence of Khiva and Bokhara was acknowledged by both parties. The Russians offered to hold a plebiscite in Panjdeh to determine whether this area should belong to Russia or to Afghanistan. A yearly subsidy of one million gold roubles was also promised by Russia, who undertook to build a telegraph line from Kushk to Kabul via Herat and Kandahar. On the 16th July 1921 M. Raskolnikov arrived at Kabul as first Russian Minister. After many vicissitudes the Amir signified his acceptance of the Treaty on which the British and Afghan delegates had been working since the spring : and, at an official meeting on the 22nd November 1921, Sir Henry Dobbs and Sirdar-i-Ala Mahmud Beg Tarzi signed the Anglo- Afghan Treaty (No. XXIV). Ratifications of the Treaty were exchanged at Kabul on the 6th February 1922. This Treaty, after certifying mutual internal and external indepen dence, and corroborating the existing Indo-Afghan frontier, provided for the establishment of British and Afghan Legations at Kabul and in London, with British Consulates at Kandahar and Jalalabad, an Afghan Consulate-General at the Headquarters of the Government of India, Afghan Consulates at Calcutta, Karachi and Bombay, and Afghan Trade Agents at Pehawar, Quetta and Parachinar; for trade and postal facilities, including a rebate of Indian customs on goods imported to India for re-export to Afghanistan; for the subsequent dis cussion of a trade convention; and for the giving of prior information of any military operations of major importance which might appear necessary for the maintenance of order among the frontiei tiibes. The Treatv was to continue in force for 3 years, and thereafter subject to one year’s notice of denunciation by either party. Schedule I annexed to the Treaty provided for a small concession of territory to the Afghan * Appendix No. VIII.Goyernment in the neighbourhood of Torkham, thereby altering the line demarcated under Article 5 of the Peace Treaty of 1919. Schedule II provided for matters of detail connected with Legations and Consulates. Added to the Treaty, and published with it, were four letters dealing more particularly with the import of munitions; excluding Russian Consulates and representatives from the territories of Jalalabad, Ghazni and Kandahar; and declaring the goodwill of the British Government towards all frontier tribes. Ihe Ireaty had hardly been signed when Sir Henry Dobbs learned that, contrary to an undertaking which had been given to him when the realignment of the Torkham boundary had been under discussion, the Afghans were still in possession of Arnawai in Chitral, which had been occupied during the period of the armistice of 1919. On November 29th (he Amir gave orders for the withdrawal of all Afghan troops fiom Arnawai and for its restoration to Chitral; and on the 4th December Sir Henry Dobbs, on his way to Peshawar, carried out the realignment o± the boundary at Torkham. Compliance with the Amir’s order for the evacuation of Arnawai was delayed till the 17th January, when Arnawai itself was handed hack to the Chitral representative. The “ lands known as Dokalim ” which were also claimed by the Mehtar of Chitral, as forming part of . rnawai were not restored, and remained in Afghan possession till 1921). le questions of title to these lands, and the delimitation of the frontier, 7'iw o’! 7 t J h&lt;!

By the middle of March 1924, however, the Afghan Government had given sufficient proof of their friendliness to permit of the passage of the arms. Shortly after, the Amir was confronted with the necessity of quelling the'Khost rebellion which lasted from March 1924 to February 1925, among the principal causes being the growing discontent in the provinces fostered by the introduction of the ££ hasht nafri ” system of conscription in the army, the attempt to introduce a general system of female educa tion, and the sudden promulgation of the new Administrative Code (Nizamnama). In March rumours of trouble in Khost were reported. By the middle of April the whole of the Southern Province was involved and from then onwards the Afghan Government were mainly occupied in an endeavour to localise the outbreak and prevent it spreading to the Ghilzai tribes. The army at the outset suffered a series of reverses at the hands of the tribal rebels. The latter, emboldened by success and encouraged by the arrival from India of a figure-head in the person of one Abdul Karim, a bastard son of the ex-Amir Yakub Khan, who had succeeded in escaping from surveillance in India, had by the end of duly cut the main communication between Kabul and the South and were within 25 miles of the capital. Emissaries were despatched to raise the Hazaras and the tribes of the Eastern Province; regular troops were withdrawn to defend the city, and on the 11th August war was officially declared against the Mangals of Khost. This vigorous action, coupled with the arrival in Kabul of two British aeroplanes, purchased by the Afghan Government, turned the tide, and by the beginning of September negotiations had been opened by the rebel leaders. The ensuing five months witnessed the gradual break up of the rebel forces. The Ghilzais. who had never been seriously involved, were quickly detached; early in October the Mangals of Khost made terms, and in December the Zadran leaders, who had till then harboured Abdul Karim, were induced to come into Kabul to negotiate terms with the Amir. Abdul Karim fled to India where he was quickly arrested, and the arrival in Kabul under escort of his chief supporter, the Lame Mulla, on the 30th January 1925. marks the close of the rebellion. The state of Afghanistan at the close of the rebellion was sufficiently serious. The financial resources of the State were exhausted, the internal disunion of the races inhabiting the country had been demonstrated, a check had been given to the Amir’s schemes for moral and educational progress, and a steady deterioration was apparent in the administration of the provinces. The occasion was one which demanded the Bulei s whole attention in an endeavour to regain lost ground, but foi the next eighteen months his attentions were diverted by a seiies of incidents which endangered his relations with Italy, Germany and Russia succes-228 AFGHANISTAN. sively. Between 1921 and 1923 lie had entered into diplomatic relations with Italy (June 1921), France* * (Agreement April 1922, Archeological Convention, September 1922f) and Belgium (February 1923). The entry of Afghanistan into the comity of nations had opened its doors to an influx of foreigners engaged for the most part by the Afghan Govern ment to carry out the Amir s programme for the moral and material advancement of his country. In May 1925 the execution of an Italian for causing the death of an Afghan subject, and in November 1925 the arrest and detention of a German subject on a similar charge, led to temporary crises between Afghanistan and the two countries concerned. The latter event, though it eventually led to the recall of the German representative, did not however prevent the conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship with Germany in March 1926. In December 1925 a detachment of Russian troops occupied the Island of Urta Tagai on the Oxus, regarding which there had been a long standing dispute between the two Governments. The affair caused some excitement m Kabul, but turned out to be merely a frontier incident for which the Soviet Government made as speedy amends as possible. On the 31st August 1926 a Pact of neutrality and non-aggressioni” between the Soviet and Afghan Governments was signed at Paghman. The multilateral international engagements which Afghanistan has signed or to which she is a party, so far as is known, are the following : — Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick of Armies in the Field (Red Cross Convention), 1906. Universal Postal Convention, 1924. International Treaty for the Renunciation of War as an Instru ment of National Policy (Kellog Pact), 1928. International Sanitary Convention, 1926. Multilateral Treaty regulating the Status of Spitzbergen, 1920. In June 1926 the British Legation was informed that the Amir would 1 „ future be styled Padshah : and an announcement by the Afghan Legation in London was published in “ Times ” to the effect that Reconn H ''f t ik 110 ™ “ His Ma j est y the Eing of Afghanistan.

A meeting between the King and the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, was unfortunately pre vented by the sudden illness of the latter at Bombay. After visiting Egypt, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland, King Amanulla and Queen Souriya were met at Dover by the Prince of Wales on the 13th March 1928, and were State guests at Buckingham Palace for three days, official banquets being held also at the Foreign Office and the Guildhall. After the conclusion of the official visit, the King visited Windsor, Oxford, Sandhurst, and many industrial centres, and was present at naval, military and air force exercises. Leaving Eng land on the 5th April, he returned to Germany for an operation on his throat: and proceeded thence to Poland, Russia, Turkey and Persia, crossing the Meshed-Herat frontier on the 22nd June and arriving in Kabul on the 2nd July. Shortly before leaving Afghanistan he had concluded a treaty for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Poland (November 192T), and an Air Agreement with Russia (November 1927* * * § ). He also concluded a Treaty of Friendship and Security with Persia (November 1927t). In March 1928 an Agreement^ was concluded between the aerial departments of the Afghan and Russian Governments regarding the details necessary to the operation of the Russo-Afghan Air Agreement of 1927. In the course of his tour the following ten additional treaties, pacts and protocols were concluded : — Letto-Afghan (February 1928); Swiss-Afghan (February 1928); Japano-Afghan (April 1928); Egypto-Afghan (May 1928) § ; Turco-Afghan (May 1928)11; Perso-Afghan (June 1928)11 Perso-Afghan (Extradition) (June 1928)**; Perso-Afghan (Frontier Commission) (June 1928)tf; Finno-Afghan (July 1928); Liberian-Afghan (1928); * Appendix No. X1T. t Appendix No. XIII.

Negotiations were also announced to be taking place at this time with a number of other countries including China and the Hejaz. During his absence the country had remained entirely peaceful. His visits to the various cajntals of Europe had been followed with interest by his people, and, particularly among the intelligentsia of Kabul, con siderable satisfaction was evinced at the warmth of his reception, and at the favourable impression he appeared to have created. The return of the Royal party was welcomed by the people of Afghan istan, but there was a feeling of suspense throughout the country and symptoms of doubt and unrest began to show themselves among the powerful conservative and clerical elements of the population. After two months spent in retirement at Eaghman, the King launched his programme of reforms. On the occasion of the annual Festival of Independence in September 1928 he placed before the assembled Great Council of 1,000 delegates from all parts of the country proposals which included the emancipation of women, the suppression of the influence of the Mullahs, universal education and a general system of modernisation i) trade, communications and the army. In subsequent public addresses the King developed these principles and drew attention to the fact that he had established treaty relations with many countries. Ihe King s proposals were received with almost universal dissatis faction throughout the country, his programme for the emancipation of women, and his measures directed against the interests of the Mullahs being particularly unpopular among the conservative and fanatical ele ments on his Eastern and Southern frontiers. In November 1928 the Shinwaris broke out into open rebellion, attacked outlying garrisons, and brought to a standstill all traffic between aalalabad and Dakka. The revolt spread and in the middle of December an attack on Kabul was made by a brigand leader from Koh-i-daman named Dacha-i-Saqao. His first attack was repulsed after severe fighting and lie retired to collect further strength. The King attempted to con ciliate his people by an offer to cancel his more repugnant measures of ie orm His troops, however, were unsuccessful in. resisting a fresh attack by Bacha-i-Saqao, who by the 13th January was once more on the outskuts of Kabul. On the 14th King Amanullah abdicated in favour of Ins brother Muin-us-Saltanat Sirdar Inayatulla Khan, who, however, himself abdicated three days later and found his way via India to join his brother at Kandahar. A few days later Bacha-i-Saqao proclaimed him- se f Amir with the style of Habibulla Ghazi, and simultaneously Aman- ulla Khan at Kandahar revoked his abdication, and busied himself in collecting an army to regain the throne. On the 24th and 25th February the British, French and Italian Legations were closed, the Ministers and their staffs being evacuated byAFGHANISTAN. 231 air to India. British Consular Officers at Jalalabad and Kandahar were also withdrawn. On the 22nd May Amanulla Khan, who had advanced with his forces as far as Kelat-i-Ghilzai, encountered strong opposition and, abandoning the struggle, crossed the Afghan border at Chaman on the 23rd en route for Italy. The departure of Anianulla Khan left Kandahar at the mercy of Habibulla whose forces entered it a few days later, while one of his Generals advancing from Mazar-i-Sharif, had in the previous month captured Herat. During the latter operation, however, Grhulam Nabi Afghan Ambassador in Moscow, acting in the interests of Amanulla Khan, recovered Mazar-i-Sharif and advanced towards the Hindu Kush, while Sirdar Nadir Khan, who had entered Khost in March from India, menaced the Kabul Government from the South. The summer was spent by Nadir Khan in attempts to raise the tribes of the Southern Province against Habibulla and early in October 1929, after eight months of in decisive struggle, he entered Kabul. His forces which captured the city under the command of his brother Shah Wali Khan included a contingent of Wazir tribesmen. On the 15th October Nadir Khan was accepted as King by his following and the peple of Kabul and on the 1st November Habibulla, who had been captured at Jabal-us-Siraj, was executed with his leading officials. On the Tth November intimation was received from Kabul that King Nadir Shah had nominated his bother, His Highness General Shah \\ aJi Khan, as his representative in London and on the 15th November His Majesty’s Government formally recognised the new Afghan Government. On the 20th December a British Minister Mr. K. R. Maconachie was appointed to Kabul which he reached with his staff on the 11th May 1930. On the 6th May Notes (No. XXA I) were exchanged between His Majesty’s Government and the Afghan Minister in London reaffirming the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921 (No. XXIV) and the Trade Convention of 1923 (No. XXV). It is believed that certain of the treaties concluded with other countries by the Government of e^-King Amanulla have also been reaffirmed, and in November 1930 a Treaty of 1 riendship between Afghanistan and Japan was signed in London. The first tasks confronting King Nadir Shah on his accession were the consolidating of his position and restoration of order in the country. In the north the situation was obscure, while the attitude of the Governoi of Herat, who had been appointed by Habibulla, was uncertain. In the south Kandahar, which had been captured for the King in October 1929 by a mixed force of Achakzais and other Duranis, acknowledged Jiis accession, but the Ghilzais and tribes of the Southern Piovince seemediii—onroiiinMB—Bumw—ellHIl 232 AFGHANISTAN. unwilling to give up the independence which they had enjoyed during the recent anarchy. Two serious revolts, by the Shinwaris in February and by the people of Koh-i-daman in July 1930, were successfully overcome, but financial and other difficulties remained. At the end of September 1930 His Majesty’s Government, with a view to assisting towards the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the restoration of stable conditions after the recent civil wars, made a gift of 10,000 rifles and ammunition and a loan of £100,000, which was followed a few months later by a further loan of £75,000. In September 1930 the first “ Great Assembly ” of King Nadir Shah’s reign met at Kabul. Resolutions were passed in favour of a democratic monarchy with Nadir Shah as King, and of forfeiture of ex-King Aman- ulla Khan’s property in Afghanistan. By the middle of October the nomad Ghilzais, whose attitude during the summer had caused some anxiety, had moved down to India and the first anniversary of the King’s entry into Kabul was celebrated in an atmosphere of comparative peace. Only on his northern borders, where a Basmachi outlaw, Ibrahim Beg, had for some months been raiding on both sides of the Oxus with a consi derable following, was there any cause for immediate anxiety. In De cember he despatched his brother, General Shah Mahmud, the War Minister, with a considerable force to deal with this outlaw and establish his authority in the Northern Provinces. tilai tkeei »k tom ieatc bidAFGHANISTAN—NO. 1—1809. 033 No. I.

Articles of Agreement made at Peshawur on the 26th January 1857 (corre sponding with Jumadee-ool-Awul, 29th a.h. 1273), between Ameer Dost Mohummud Khan, Ruler of Cabool and of those countries of Afghanis tan now in his possession, on his own part, and Sir John Lawrence, k.c.b., Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, and Lieutenant-Colonel H. B. Ed- wardes, c.b., Commissioner of Peshawur on the part of the Honorable East India Company, under the authority of the Right Honorable Charles John, Viscount Canning, Governor-General of India in Council. 1. Whereas the Shah of Persia contrary to his engagement with the British Government, has taken possession of Herat, and has manifested an intention to interfere in the present possessions of Ameer Dost Mohummud Khan, and there is now war between the British and Persian Governments, therefore the Honorable East India Company, to aid Ameer Dost Mohummud Khan, to defend and maintain his present possessions in Balkh, Cabool, and Candahar against Persia, hereby agrees out of friendship to give the said Ameer one lakh of Com pany s Rupees monthly during the war with Persia on the following conditions 2. The Ameer shall keep his present number of Cavalry and Artillery, and shall maintain not less than 18,000 Infantry, of which 13,000 shall be Regulars divided into 13 Regiments. 3. The Ameer is to make his own arrangements for receiving the money at the British treasuries and conveying it through his own country. 4. British Officers, with suitable native establishments and orderhes, shall be deputed, at the pleasure of the British Government, to Cabool or Candahar, or Balkh, or all three places, or wherever an Afghan army be assembled to act against the Persians. It will be their duty to see generally that the subsidy grant ed to the Ameer be devoted to the military purposes for which it is given, and to keep their own Government informed of all affairs. They will have nothing to do with the payment of the troops, or advising the Cabool Government; and they will not interfere in any way in the internal administration of the country. The Ameer will be responsible for their safety and honorable treatment, while in his country, and for keeping them acquainted with all military and political matters connected with the war. b* The Ameer of Cabool shall appoint and maintain a Yakeel at Peshawur.AFGHANISTAN—NO. V—1857. 239 6 . The subsidy of one lakh per mensem shall cease from the date on which peace is made between the British and Persian Governments, or at any previous time at the will and pleasure of the Governor-General of India. 7. Whenever the subsidy shall cease the British officers shall be withdrawn from the Ameer’s country ; but at the pleasure of the British Government, a Vakeel, not a European Officer, shall remain at Cabool on the part of the British Govern ment, and one at Peshawur on the part of the Government of Cabool. 8. The Ameer shall furnish a sufficient escort for the British officers from the British border when going to the Ameer’s country, and to the British border when returning. 9. The subsidy shall commence from 1st January 1857, and be payable at the British treasury one month in arrears. 10. The five lakhs of Rupees which have been already sent to the Ameer (three to Candahar and two to Cabool), will not be counted in this Agreement. They are a free and separate gift from the Honorable East India Company. But the sixth lakh now in the hands of the mahajuns of Cabool, which was sent for another purpose, will be one of the instalments under this Agreement. 11. This Agreement in no way supersedes the Treaty made at Peshawur on 30th March 1855 (corresponding with the 11th of Rujjub 1271), by which the Ameer of Cabool engaged to be the friend of the friends and enemy of the enemies of the Honorable East India Company ; and the Ameer of Cabool, in the spirit of that Treaty, agrees to communicate to the British Government any overtures he may receive from Persia or the allies of Persia during the war, or while there is friendship between the Cabool and British Governments. 12. In consideration of the friendship existing between the British Govern ment and Ameer Dost Mohummud Khan, the British Government engages to overlook the past hostilities of all the tribes of Afghanistan, and on no account to visit them with punishment. 13. Whereas the Ameer has expressed a wish to have 4,000 muskets given him in addition to the 4,000 already given, it is agreed that 4,000 muskets shall be sent by the British Government to Tull, whence the Ameer’s people will con vey them with their own carriage.

Present: On behalf of Great Britain— Colonel Ridgeway. Major Durand. On behalf of Russia— Colonel Kuhlberg. Capitaine Guedeonoitf. M. P. Lessar. Protocol No. 14 was read and adopted. Colonel Ridgeway then read a copy of a telegram from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs received on the 3rd September, informing him of the conclu sion of an agreement between the English and Russian Governments for the recall of the two Commissions. He proposed to annex this document to the present protocol. Colonel Kuhlberg acknowledged having received a similar despatch with the exception of the last phrase regarding the status quo. It was then decided that the synopsis of the boundary marks constructed by the Commission, prepared by Major Holdich, and sent to Colonel Kuhlberg on the 3rd August, should be annexed to the protocol. Colonel Kuhlberg speaking about the four last pillars regarding which a dis cussion had taken place at the last sitting, said that Major Holdich had corrected his first calculations, and it was found that these four marks were more to the north than had been at first supposed. The Oi-Kul, for example, is a verst to the north of the position originally marked on the map. Colonel Ridgeway re ferred the matter to Major Holdich, who replied that there was nothing absolutely final in this, inasmuch as the computations had not been verified. It was not impossible that the first position assigned to Oi-Kul was the better. He added that the position of the last mark near Imam Nazur had not been changed. Colo nel Kuhlberg proposed to reconsider the last part of the frontier from Chichli.240 AFGHANISTAN—NO. VIII—1886. Colonel Ridgeway replied that in his opinion this question should be considered by the two Governments. Colonel Kuhlberg thought that in this case the two Commissioners should not sign the maps any further than Chichli, but Colonel Ridgeway preferred to leave the maps without any signature, if they could not be signed up to Dakchi, the two Governments having in his opinion confirmed the frontier as far as that place. Colonel Ridgeway then proposed to attach to the protocol copies of the maps surveyed by Captains Kontratenko and Peacocke in the valleys of the Kushk and Kaahan, in accordance with the agreement reported in protocol No. 4. Colo nel Kuhlberg having given his assent, Colonel Ridgeway remarked that since the month of April, Captains Peacocke and Guedeonoff had not been able to agree as to the extent of the land which should be ceded by Afghanistan for the con struction of an embankment at Meruchak (regarding the construction of which an agreement had been arrived at on certain conditions reported in protocols Nos. 4 and 5) and the question had not been decided. It was thereupon agreed that the land to be ceded for the head of an embank ment on the right bank of the Murghab should not exceed 150 yards in length by 75 yards in breadth. Colonel Ridgeway made it known that he had received a report concerning the destruction of certain boundary marks in the valley of Meruchak owing to recent inundations. It was arranged that Colonel Tarkanoff should be asked by Colonel Kuhlberg to co-operate with Mr. Merk, who would shortly be at Meruchak, for the recon struction of these marks. Colonel Ridgeway, in regretting that in conjunction •with his colleague he had not been able to entirely finish the work they had undertaken, could not allow the Commission to adjourn without expressing his sincere pleasure at the main tenance of cordial relations between the two Commissions in spite of the differ ence of opinion which had arisen upon several claims. He could only think that this was in a great measure due to the courtesy of Colonel Kuhlberg and his col leagues. He wished to add that the Russian topographical officers had had beyond comparison the most difficult part of the survey work, and he hoped that Colonel Kuhlberg would be good enough to thank them from him in expressing to them his gratitude for the admirable execution of their difficult work. Colonel Kuhlberg thanked his colleague and said that the English topogra phical officers having undertaken the triangulation as well as a considerable por tion of the survey, had had in his opinion their full share of the work. The present protocol having been corrected and read was then formally adopt ed, and the labours of the Commission were declared at an end. P. Kuhlberg. J. Ridgeway. E. L. Durand.AFGHANISTAN—NO. IX—1887. 247 No. IX. [TRANSLATION.] Demarcation of the North-West Frontier of Afghanistan. PROTOCOL No. 4. Sitting held at St. Petersburgh, 10th (22nd) July 1887. The Privy Councillor Zinoview and Colonel Sir West Ridgeway, having met with the object of coming to a definite understanding as to the terms of an arrange ment for the solution of the difficulties which arose on the occasion of the demar cation of the Afghan frontier on the left bank of the Amou-Daria began by re capitulating the course which the negotiations between them had taken up to the present time. As appears from the previous protocols, the Cabinet of London was of opinion that the arrangement arrived at in 1873 between the two Governments had for its object to confirm the rights of the Amir of Afghanistan over all the districts of which Shere Ali Khan was in possession at that time, and that on this basis the district of Khamiab, which in accordance with the information obtained on the spot, had been incorporated in Afghanistan long before the date of the arrange ment in question, should also remain subject to the authority of the Amir Abdur rahman Khan. The Imperial Government of Russia could not adopt this view, and taking as a basis the text of the arrangement of 1873, they affirmed that the present state of things on the left bank of the Amou-Daria could not be considered as invalidating the rights of Bokhara resulting from that arrangement. The Imperial Government considered it still less possible to sacrifice those rights, since, in consequence of the demarcation carried out in accordance with the terms of the Protocol of London of the 29th August (10th September) 1885, the Sarik Turkomans of the Penjdeh Oasis had been dispossessed of the lands which they had previously held, and those lands had been included in the terri tory of Afghanistan. Having regard to this difference of opinion, and being desirous of proving their respect for the letter itself of the arrangement concluded between the two Governments, the Cabinet of Her Britannic Majesty has authorised Sir West Ridgeway to propose a frontier, which, starting from Dukchi, the point to which the demarcation had already been carried out, would terminate at the Amou- Daria, in the neighbourhood of Islim. After a detailed examination obtained by their Commissioner on the spot, the British Cabinet had arrived at the con clusion that Islim answered in every respect to the frontier point of Khodja-Saleh, of which mention is made in the correspondence relative to the arrangement. This proposal was likewise unacceptable to the Imperial Cabinet of Russia, who, looking at the question from a totally different point of view, maintained that, in view of the differences of opinion which had arisen between the respec tive Commissioners when discussing the bearing of the local information, the identity of the geographical names could alone serve as the basis for an equitable248 AFGHANISTAN—NO. IX—1887. demarcation, that the Serai Khodja-Saleh, situated in the vicinity of the Ziaret known under the same name, should be considered as the extreme point of the Afghan possessions on the Amou-Daria, and that the frontier should be drawn immediately below the Serai in question. In the opinion of the Cabinet of Her Britannic Majesty a demarcation carried out under these conditions would be likely to entail serious inconvenience, espe cially having regard to the fact that the canals used for the irrigation of the terri tory lying between Khodja-Saleh and Islim take their rise in the neighbourhood of Kilif* a circumstance which could not fail to be the source of continual dis putes between the populations on either side of the frontier. In order to obviate these objections, the Cabinet of Her Britannic Majesty considered it preferable to give up the attempt to come to an understanding as to a fresh frontier on the left bank of the Amou-Daria, and to authorise Sir W. Bidgeway to offer to the Imperial Russian Government in exchange for the territory which they claimed on the left bank of Amou-Daria, compensation on another part of the frontier. This compensation related to the territory of which the Sarik Turkomans of Penj- deh as explained above had been dispossessed in consequence of the tracing of the frontier in conformity with the provisions contained in the Protocol of London of the 29th August (10th September ) 1885. This proposal having received the adhesion of the Imperial Russian Govern ment, M. Zinoview and Sir West Ridgeway have agreed on the following pro visions :— 1 . The frontier, the description of which is contained in the Annex to the present Protocol under the letter (A) and which is included between the pillars No. 1 and No. 19 and the pillars No. 36 and No. 65, is considered as definitely settled. The trigonometrical points on the portion of the frontier line described above and included between pillars No. 19 and No. 36 are likewise admitted as definitive; the description of this part of the frontier, as well as that of the part to the east ward of the pillar No. 65, may be completed after the demarcation. The synopsis of pillars attached to Protocol No. 15, dated the 1st (13th) Sep tember 1886, is admitted to be correct and definitive as regards pillars No. 1 to No. 19, and Ko. 36 to No. 65 ; it will be completed subsequently by the synopsis of the pillars from No. 20 to No. 35 and by that of the pillars to the east of No. 65. 2 . Leaving pillar No. 19, the frontier shall follow a straight line up to the sum mit of the hill marked 2,740 on map No. 1 annexed to the present protocol. This point, where pillar No. 20 shall be placed, is known under the denomination of “ trigonometrical station of Kara Tepe ” (latitude 35° 17' 49', longitude 62° 15' 17 ). Further on the line shall descend the crest of the hills, being directed from this point towards the confluence of the Kushk and the Moghur pillar No. 21 shall be placed on a point of this crest or of its slope, so as to be seen from theAFGHANISTAN—NO. IX—1887. 249 confluence above mentioned. A straight line shall connect No. 21 with No. 22 placed in the valley of Kushk on the left bank of the river, 900 feet to the north of the confluence of the Kushk and the Moghur (about 6,300 feet from Masari Shah Alanr, indicated on map No. 2 annexed to the protocol). Leaving pillar No. 22 the line shall ascend the thalweg of the Kushk to pillar No. 23, placed 2,700 feet above the head of the new canal on the right bank, of which the water-supply is situated about 6,000 feet to the north-north-east of the Ziaret of Chahil-Dukhter. From pillar No. 23 a straight line shall be traced to the point marked 2,925 on map No. 3 annexed to the present protocol (latitude 35° 16' 53', longitude 62° 27' 57', pillar No. 24) whence the frontier shall follow the line of the water-parting passing through the following points : the point 3,017 (Bandi Akhamar, latitude 35° 14' 21', longitude 62° 25' 48', pillar No. 26), the point 3,198 (latitude 35° 14' 30', longitude 62° 41' 0', pillar No. 27) and the point Kalari 2 (latitude 35° 18' 21', longitude 62° 47' 18') and shall run on to the point marked No. 29 on map No. 4 annexed to the present protocol. The frontier shall cross the valley of the River Kashan in a straight line between pillars No. 29 and No. 30 (trigonometrical station of Tori Scheikh, latitude 35° 24' 51', longitude 62° 59' 43') and shall follow the line of the water-parting of Sanicha to the point (pillar No. 31 of map No. 3), where it meets the line of the water- parting of the Kashan and the Murghab, shall pass on to this latter and shall follow it up to the trigonometrical station of the Kashan (latitude 35° 38' 13', longitude 63° 6' 4', pillar No. 32). From this station a straight line shall be traced to a point on the Murghab (pillar No. 35, situated 700 feet above the canal-head of the canal Yaki-Yuz (or Yaki-Yangi). Further on, the frontier descending the thalweg of the Murghab, shall join pillar No. 36 of the frontier demarcated in 1885-86. To the east of pillar No. 65 the frontier shall follow the line marked A, B, C&gt; D, on map No. 8 annexed to the present protocol, the point A being situated at a distance of 3,500 feet south of the wells of Imam Nazar ; the point B being near Kara-Tepe Khurd-Kak, which remains to the Afghans ; the point C about mid way between the east and west wells of Katabadji; and, lastly, the point D about midway between the wells Ali Kadim and the wells marked Chahi. The wells of Imam Nazar, Kara-Tepe-Khurd, West Katabadji, and Ali Kadim remain out side of Afghan territory. From the point D a straight line shall be traced as far as the commencement of the local frontier demarcated between Bosagha and Khamiab, which shall continue to serve as frontier between the two villages, with the single reservation that the canals of Bosagha along all their course, that is to say, as far as Konili (point H) shall be included in Russian territory. In other words, the present demarcation will confirm the existing rights of the two parties on the banks of the Amou-Daria, that is to say, that the inhabitants of Khamiab shall retain all their lands and all their pastures, including those which are east of the local frontier marked E, F, G, on maps Nos. 9 and 10 annexed to the Pro tocol. On the other hand, the inhabitants of Bosagha shall retain the exclusive enjoyment of their canals as far as Konili, with the right of repairing and supply-ss 250 AFGHANISTAN—NO. IX—1 SB7. mg them in accordance with the customs in force in regard to those of Khamiab, when the waters of the Amou-Daria are too low to supply directly the canal-heads of Konili. The officers who shall be charged to execute on the spot the provisions of the present Protocol between the above-named pillars shall be bound to place a sufficient number of intermediate pillars, taking advantage for this purpose as much as possible of the salient points. 3. The clause in Protocol No. 4 of the 14th (26th) December 1885. prohibiting the Afghans from making use of the irriga ting canals in the Kushk ^ alley below Chahil Dukhter which were not in use at that time, remains in force, but it is understood that this clause can only be applied to the canals supplied by the Kushk- The Afghans shall not have the right to make use of the waters of the Kushk for their agricultural works north of Chahil Dukhter ; but the waters of the Moghur belong exclusively to them, and they may carry out any works they may think necessary in order to make use of them. 4. The clauses in Protocols No. 4 of the 14th (26th) December 1885, and No. 15 of the 1st (13th) September 1886, relative to the construction of a dam on the Murghab. remain in force. M. Zinoview having expressed the wish that the obli gation imposed on the Amir of Afghanistan to give up for this purpose a tract of land on the right bank of the Murghab under the conditions stipulated in the said protocols, should be extended to the whole course of the river below the canal- head of Yaki-Yuz, Colonel Ridgeway is of opinion that the necessary steps to obtain the assent of the Amir might delay the conclusion of the present arrange ment ; but he is nevertheless convinced that the assent of the Amir to the cession, under the same conditions, of a tract of land on the right bank can be obtained without difficulty, if later on the Imperial Government should inform Her Bri tannic Majesty's Government of their intention of proceeding to the construc tion of a dam above the canal-head of Bendi-Nadiri. 5. The British Government will communicate without delav to the Amir of Afghanistan the arrangements herein agreed upon, and the Imperial Govern ment of Russia will enter into possession of the territorv adjudged to them by the present protocol from the 1st (13th) October of the present year. 6 . The frontier agreed upon shall be locally demarcated by a Mixed Commission* according to the signed maps. In case the work of demarcation should be delayed the line traced on the maps shall nevertheless be considered binding by the two Governments. W. Ridgeway. J. ZlIsOVIEWAFGHANISTAN—NO. IX—18S7. 251 [TRANSLATION.] ANNEX to PROTOCOL No. 4. (A) Description of the Afghan Frontier between the Heri-Rud and the Oxus (Amou-Daria). The frontier begins on the right bank of the Heri-Rud at a point marked on the map by pillar No. 1 about 8,500 feet distant from a small tower situated on a mound at the entrance of the Zulficar Pass. Pillar No. 2 is placed on the top of the neighbouring rock which commands pillar No. 1. From pillar No. 2, the frontier turns to the north for a distance of about half a mile as far as pillar No. 3, which is situated on an eminence at the western extremity of a detached portion of the cliff. From thence the frontier runs in a straight line towards the top of a steep hill about a mile and a half distant in an east-north-easterly direction and reaches pillar No. 4, placed on a low mound in the plain. Beyond this pillar the frontier, taking a more easterly direction, runs for a distance of 4 miles as far as pillar No. 5, placed on an eminence, and well in view of the second line of heights on the northern side of a natural cavity in the rock. From this point the frontier runs in a south-easterly direction along the crest of the second line of heights as far as pillar No. 6, placed on the ridge of the northern cliff of the eastern defile, at a distance of about a mile from the centre of the defile. Pillar No. 7 is placed below pillar No. 6 near the road in the middle of the pass, and pillar No. 8 is on the top of the southern cliff facing pillar No. 6. The frontier then descends the crest of the second line of heights in a southerly direction, and crosses the path leading to Karez-Elias and Abi-Charmi at a point about 2 J miles distant from the bifurcation of the four roads converging at the eastern extremity of the defile of Zulficar. Pillar No, 9 is placed to fhe east of the path on a small rock which overhangs it. From this pillar the frontier gradually ascends the line of water-parting as far as the highest summit of the range of Deugli-Dagh, marked by pillar No. 10. At the eastern extremity of this range stands pillar No. 11. At a distance of about 9| miles in a south-easterly direc tion are three low hills. On the middle one is placed pillar No. 12. Again turn ing somewhat to the east the frontier runs towards pillar No. 13, placed beside the road about half-way between Ak-Robat and Sumbakarez, and thence to pillar No. 14, situated at a distance of 2^ miles to the east on the top of a hill. Pillar No. 15 is about 9 miles from Ak-Robat, on the road leading to An-Rohak, from thence the frontier runs in a straight line towards pillar No. 16, placed on the more easterly and the higher of the two mounds of Koscha-Tehinguia, 5^ miles north of An-Rohak. At about the same distance to the north-west of the spring of Islim, stands pillar No, 17 placed on a flat-topped hill; on the side of the road252 AFGHANISTAN—NO. IX—1887. between An-Rohak and Islim, on a gentle slope, is placed pillar No. 18 about 3 miles west of Islim, on the southern side of the stream. Pillar No. 19 is placed on the rounded crest of a small chain of heights 3 miles south of Islim. From pillar No. 36 placed on the right bank of the Murghab, about 3 miles north of Meruchak Fort, on a height commanding the river, the frontier r uns eastwards towards pillar No. 38, passing by pillar No. 37, which is situated on the road leading from the valley of Meruchak along the Galla-Chasma Chor. Pillar No. 38 is placed on an elevated point of the “ Chul ” at about 11 miles trom the velley of Meruchak. The frontier from thence continues in an east- north-easoerly direction towards pillar No. 39, situated about a mile south-east of the spring of Khwaja-Gongourdak ; after that in a straight line and with north easterly direction towards pillar No. 40 on an elevated point of the “ Chul,” from thence east-north-east towards pillar No. 41, situated on a height about 12 miles north of Kilawali ; further on the frontier follows an east-north-easterly direc tion towards pillar No. 42, placed on a height 2 miles west of the Pakana-Shor, and continues in the same direction as far as pillar No. 43. From this pillar the frontier runs in a south-easterly direction towards pillar No. 44, placed on the most elevated point of the watershed between the basins of the Kara-Baba and the Kaissar, known by the name of Bel-i-Parandas. Following -this line in a northerly direction the frontier reaches pillar No. 45 situated about 3 miles south west of the well of Beshdara. From thence it follows in a north-easterly direc tion a branch of the watershed, and arrives at pillar No. 46, situated at a distance of more than a mile to the south-west of the w^ell of Beshdara. It runs from thence in an easterly direction irregularly towards pillar No. 47, situated about 4J miles from the point where the road from Khwaja-Gachai and Kassawa-Kala crosses the Shor-Egri. From thence the frontier runs to the north-east along a secon- darv watershed towards pillar No. 48, and follows the same line as far as pillar No. 49 which is placed at the highest point of the watershed north of the Shor- Egn, and about 6 miles to the west of the confluence of the Shor-Gandabulak and the Shor-Egri. From thence the frontier runs in a straight line to the north east, crossing the Shor-Gandabulak at pillar No. 50, which is placed on a hill with two peaks, rising from the line of water-parting between the Shor-Gandabulak and the Shor-Tara-Kui. Following the same direction it reaches Shor-Tara- ui, where pillar No. 51 is placed near the road from Jalaiour on the Kaissar to a ^ Un K° u cl ou k: and Kara-Baba. The frontier passes thence in a north-easterly direction to pillar No. 52 at a point a mile to the north of the well of Alini. From t is pillar the frontier runs north-north-east towards pillar No. 54 crossing the Daulatabad-Hazara-Koudouk road near pillar No. 53. Pillar No. 54 is placed on the highest point of a group of sandy hills 2 miles north of the well of Katar- 'oudouk , from thence the line of the frontier runs for about 10 miles with a slight inclination to the north-north-west towards pillar No. 55, placed on a mound at the end of a chain of hills which extends between the depression of Kui-Sarai and that m which the well of Khwaja-Ahmad is situated. From this pillar the frontier runs in a straight line northwards for a mile and a quarter towards pillar No. 56, which is situated on a natural elevation a few feet south of the road bet-AFGHANISTAN—NOS. IX—1887 AND X—1893. 253 ween Jalanguir and Meruehak, from thence it proceeds to pillar No. 57, 2J miles to the north-north-west, and situated on the top of the heights which form the northern limit of the depression of Kui-Sarai. From this point the frontier runs to the north-north-east towards pillar No. 58, placed on one of the sandy mounds of the heights which command the plain extending to the west of Andkhoi; the frontier then turns rather more to the east towards pillar No. 59, placed on a low sandy hill about 2J miles to the east-south-east of the wells of Sari Mat. It next reaches in a north-north-westerly direction, pillar No. 60, placed between the wells of Chichli and Gokchah, about a quarter of a mile to the west of the wells of Chichli. Leaving Gokchah to Russia, and Chichli to Afghanistan, the fron tier runs in a straight line to pillar No. 61, placed 300 feet to the east of the road which leads from Andkhoi to Sechanchi ; thence, following the same direction, it reaches pillar No. 62, placed on a well-defined sandy mound known by the name of Madali-Koum ; the frontier line then reaches in an east-north-easterly direction pillar No. 63, placed to the north of Oikul, an elliptically shaped valley 3,600 feet in length, and at the bottom of which are situated two “ Kaks ” or basins of fresh water, which remain within Afghan territory. Turning then in an east-south-easterly direction the frontier reaches in a straight line pillar No. 64, placed on a sandy hill known by the name of Gichi-Kumi, and continues in a north-easterly direction as far as pillar No. 65, placed on the high road between Andkhoi and Dugchi and Karki, at a point 4J miles to the south of Dugchi and 2§ miles to the north of Sultan Robat.

The British Commissioner will immediately take the necessary measures to execute this arrangement. II. The mill canal, marked by the letter A on the map attached to Protocol No. 1 of the Commission, not being used for irrigation, does not constitute an infraction of the stipulations of Clause III of Protocol No. 4 of 1887, but as it is at present longer than is necessary, it should be shortened to the minimum length required by local conditions, and the water of this canal cannot be used for irrigation under any pretext. The British Commissioner will take the necessary measures iu order that these arrangements may be carried out.AFGHANISTAN—NOS. X AND XI—1893. 255 III. In order to elucidate and complete Clause III of Protocol No. 4 of -&lt;^n!r 1887, the Commissioners have established that the Afghans shall not be able to take off water from the river Kushk, north of the ruins of the Chahil Dukhteran bridge (Pul-i-Khishti), for irrigation by means of either new or disused or closed canals, the Afghans shall not have the right to carry on, below the parallel of Chahil Dukhteran Frontier Pillar No. 23, for irrigation, the branches of the canals which take off from the Kushk south of the ruins of the Chahil Dukhteran bridge (Pul- i-Khishti), but they shall have the right to make use of the said branches to irri gate their cultivation as far as the parallel of the Chahil Dukhteran Frontier Pillar No. 23. The Afghans shall also have the right to the free use for irrigation or any other purpose of the waters of springs which exist on the left bank of the Kushk bet ween the hills and the river to the south of the Karatappa Frontier Pillar No. 22, up to the points where these springs reach the stream of the river. To the south of the ruins of the Chahil Dukhteran bridge (Pul-i-Khishti) the Afghans have full rights to all the water of the Kushk and. shall not be subject to any restriction whatever. IV. The want of water in the Kushk, no matter from whatever cause arising, pro vided that the Afghans maintain the stipulations of Clause III of Protocol No. 4 of July 1887, and the arrangements above set forth cannot give cause for further claims on the part of the Russian authorities.

After compliments .—When Your Highness came to the throne of Afghanistan, Sir Lepel Griffin was instructed to give you the assurance that, if any Foreign Power should attempt to interfere in Afghanistan, and if such interference should lead to unprovoked aggression on the dominions of Your Highness, in that event the British Government would be prepared to aid you to such extent and in such manner as might appear to the British Government necessary in repelling it, provided that Your Highness followed unreservedly the advice of the British Gov ernment in regard to your external relations. I have the honour to inform Your Highness that this assurance remains in force, and that it is applicable with regard to any territory which may come into your possession in consequence of the agreement which you have made with me to-day in the matter of the Oxus frontier. It is the desire of the British Government that such portion of the northern frontier of Afghanistan as has not yet been marked out should now be clearly defined ; when this has been done, the whole of Your Highness’s frontier towards the side of Russia will be equally free from doubt and equally secure. No. XIV. Agreement by Shirindil Khan as attested by Mr. Donald regarding the Afghan-Kurram frontier,— 1894. The division of the frontier of the two allied States, i.e., the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan and the illustrious Government of India, between the Jajis and Turis, Khostis and Turis and Khostis and Waziris from Sikaram Sar to the Laram peak according to the map which was prepared at the Capital, Kabul, on the 2nd Jamadi-ul-awal 1311 H., corresponding to 12th November 1893, on the occasion of the visit of the Mission to His Highness the Amir, has been made as follows :— The line of boundary starts from the Sikaram peak and descends along the Azghanni watershed and thence runs along the watershed to Bargawi. From Bargawi it runs along the watershed (of) Gabzan Sar to the Peiwar Kotal and these watersheds separate the waters (drainage) of Hariob and Kurram. From the Peiwar Kotal (the boundary line) runs along the same watershed to Manri Kandao and reaches Kimatai Kotal. From Kimatai Kotal (it runs) along the watershed of the spur of the hill north and east between Istia and Kurram and (through) Margho Kandao, Mandatti Kandao, Dre Drang, Spare Gawi, Bar Tangi Sar, Bahlol Sar and Kharpachu Sar near the Istia Nullah. From these it descends from the abo\e-mentioned watershed and joins the Istia Nullah, and in this way goes along the above-mentioned ravine till it (reaches) the (limits) of the culturable lands watAFGHANISTAN—NO. XIV—1894. 259 of the Istia Jajis. (Then) it leaves the above-mentioned ravine and running between the pastures of Jajis and Turis it passes to the western end of the Tewza hillock. (Thence) it (runs) between the culturable lands of the people of Pathan and Kharlachi, and reaches the Lora which it follows, and passing through Lora Khula it runs between the culturable lands of the people of Pathan and Kharlaciu, and on crossing the Kurram River it runs between the culturable lands of the afore said people to Sulimani Chowki on the hill near the south (bank) of Kurram. (Thence) ascending the Shon watershed and from there along the watershed of the same hill which separates the drainage of Shpol and Dozegar and Kurram and passing through Zer Kamar, Babkai Sar and Inzar Kandao and Tabibulla Kandao it ascends the summit of Mount Khwaja Khidr, generally known as Khwaja Khurm. From there it runs along the watershed of the hill which makes the water parting of China, Kot, etc., on the Jaji Maidan side and Kurram—it passes through Saide Kotanra and reaches Cherai Kandao. From Cherai Kandao it runs along the watershed of the above-mentioned hill till it reaches the Manz Darwazgai Pass and from Manz Darwazgai (it runs) along the Avatershed of the hill which makes the water parting between the Manz Darwazgai and Istar Darwazgai ravines it reaches the Chapra Sar watershed. Near Shua Darga it descends from Chapra Sar through Niazo Ghundi or Dorani Mela Sar and along the watershed of Bando Raga to the point of junction of the Shua Darga and Manz Darwazgai ra\ r ines and crossing the above-mentioned ravines by the Lakka Tiga road it follows the above-mentioned road to the watershed of the Ninawar Khwar and Jaji Maidan (ravine) which it ascends to the Walli Hill. It descends along the watershed of the above-mentioned hill to Tirwa Watkai. Thence it crosses the Jaji Maidan ravine to Tirwa Watkai, the second, and circling round the Malli Khel Turi grave yard which is left to Kurram, it joins the foot of the Turkomanzai (spur). It (passes) through the limits of the pastures of Zerpan to Zere Sar, Shamshad Sar in a straight line to Dawe Sar, i.e., to the east of Koh-i-Naryag Sar. From there it runs along the watershed of the hill that divides the water of Khost from that of Kurram and passes through Ghwanda Cherai, Shaona Kandao, Manjarra Kandao, Khost and Kurram Kandao and Guldin Sar. Thence it ascends along the water shed to Shobakghar, i.e., the Inzar Mountain. It goes along the watershed of the above-mentioned hill and thence along the watershed of Shua Algad Sar to Batoi Kandao and along the watershed it passes through Istar Dar till it reaches the point of meeting of the watersheds of Kurram and Khost and Hassan Khels. Thence it runs along the watershed of the hill between Karangai and the country of the Hassan Khel Wazirs and passing through Manjarra Sar and Andarpaia Kandao it descends along the watershed to Tarlai Tangi and (then) crossing the Kaitu stream it ascends along the watershed of the hill which divides the drainage of the Laram ravine from that of the Gorambai and Goreshta (nullahs). It passes through Ucha Laram Sar and Bezo Sar till it joins on to the Laram peak shown in the map. Ends. I, Sardar Shirindil Khan, Naib Salar-i-Mulki, and I, J.

Agreement defining the boundary line from the Hindu Kush to the neighbour hood of Nawa Kotal, dated Camp Nashagam, the 9th April 1895—13th Shawal 1312. For as much as, under Article (4) of the Convention concluded at Kabul on the 12th November 1893, between His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan and Sir Mortimer Durand on behalf of the Government of India, we, the undersigned- have been appointed by our respective Governments for the purpose of demar eating in concert the frontier of His Highness the Amir’s dominions on the side of India in this neighbourhood of Chitrar and Bajaur, it is hereby agreed as follows :— (I) That on the western side of the Kunar river, this frontier will be the further or eastern watershed of the stream which in the idiom of Afghans is notorious and known as the Landai Sin pertaining to the limits of Kafiristan, and w T hich in the Survey map is also written by the name of Bashgal, so that all the country of which the drainage falls into the Kunar river by means of this stream belongs, and will belong, to Afghanistan, and the eastern drainage of this watershed, which does not fall into the Landai Sin stream, pertains to Chitrar. (II) That on the eastern side of the Kunar river, from the river bank, up to the crest of the main range which forms the watershed between the Kunar river * BarauLof our quarter and tlie countr 3 r ( ]it - direction) of Barawml* and Bajaur inch map this frontier follow's the southern watershed of the R. U[dn\]. Arnawai stream wdiich falls into the Kunar river close to the village of Arnawmi, leaving to Chitrar all the country of which the drainage falls into the Kunar river by means of this stream, while the southern drainage of this last-mentioned watershed, which does not fall into the Arnawai stream, pertains to Afghanistan. (III) That this frontier line, on reaching the crest of the main range which in this neighbourhood forms the watershed betw r een the Kunar river and the country (lit. direction) of Barawal and Bajaur, turns southward along this water shed, which it follows as far as a point in the neighbourhood of the Nawa Kotal,AFGHANISTAN—NO. XV—1895. 2G1 leaving all the country draining into the Kunar river within the limits of Afghanis tan and all the country draining towards Barawal and Bajaur outside the limits of Afghanistan ; but beyond the aforesaid point in the neighbourhood of the Nawa Kotal the frontier has not at present been demarcated. (IV) That on both sides of the Kunar river this frontier, as described in the three preceding articles, for the most part requires no artificial demarcation, be cause it is a natural boundary following the crests of mountain ranges ; but since at present inspection in situ is impossible, when the ground is examined on the spot, it is probable that in the places where these mountain ranges abut on the Kunar river from either side, demarcation by pillars for a short distance from the water’s edge on both sides of the river will be found desirable for the purpose of separating the boundary of Afghanistan from Arnawai pertaining to Chitrar and the limits of the Kafir country (lit., Kafiristan) of the Landai Sin from Chitrar. In that case these pillars will be erected along the line of the watershed described in the first and second articles of the present agreement, subject to any slight divergencies from this line which may be necessary to protect the local rights of villages adjoining the frontier. (V) That the frontier pillars, wherever considered desirable will be erected hereafter by an officer of the Government of India and an officer of His Highness the Amir acting in concert. (VI) That these watersheds forming the frontier agreed upon as described in the first three articles of the present agreement, have been marked by a red line on the survey map attached to this agreement, which, like the agreement itself, has been signed by us both. In three places, viz., (i) for a short distance from either bank of the Kunar river, (ii) in the neighbourhood of the Binshi Kotal, and (iii) in the neighbourhood of the Frepaman Kotal, this red line has been broken up into dots because the exact position of the watershed in these localities has not been ascertained with perfect accuracy ; but wherever the watershed may lie the frontier will follow it, subject only to any slight variations from the water shed which may be considered necessary under Article (4) of the present agreement. (VII) That, since on the map attached to the Convention* the Arnawai stream was drawn on the western side of the river in the place ^ the Durand 0 f the Landai Sin of the Kafir country (lit. Kafiristan) R. U[dny]. which has been decided to pertain to the Afghan Gov ernment, and, since after enquiry and inspection of the same it was clearly ascertained by the Survey party that the aforesaid stmim is situated on the eastern side of the Kunar river, and falls into the river near the village of Arnawai, and that the drawing of it on the western side (of the river) in the place of the Landai Sin was a mistake, this Arnawai stream has (now) been drawn and marked on the present survey map in its own proper place, and that stream which was drawn in the Convention map on the western side of the river was the Landai Sin stream of the Kafir country (lit. Kafiristan) which has now been decided to pertain to the Government of Afghanistan and to be included in the limits of Afghanistan. Accordingly in the present survey map it has been262 AFGHANISTAN—NO. XVI—1895. marked with the name of Landai Sin and has also been written with the name of Bashgal. Moreover, Sao and Nari and Birkot, and the village of Arnawai, were not written on the map attached to the Convention, (but) now in the new Survey map the names of all these four above-mentioned villages have been entered, the village of Arnawai being written on the Chitrar side of the boundary line, and Sao, Nari and Birkot on the side of the Government of Afghanistan. No. XVI. Joint Agreement executed by the Joint Afghan and British Commissioners of the Indian Afghan Boundary Commission, —1895. We, the undersigned Commissioners, deputed by our lespective Governments to demarcate the boundary line between the territories of the Government of India and His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan, westwards, from the junction of the Kundar and Gomal rivers, have arrived at the following mutual agreement regarding that boundary line, in accordance with the maps and instructions fur nished to us by our respective Governments. Clause Ao. 1 .—The boundary^ line to which we have mutually agreed runs from Domandi, i.e., the junction of the Gomal and Kundar rivers, along the line of the watercourse of the Kundar river as far as the junction of the Kundar and Kundil rivers. It thence runs along the watercourse of the Kundil river, which is here generally known as the Zhizha as far as the junction of the Kundil and Sharan Toi rivers, From the junction of the Gomal and Kundar to the junction of the Kundil and Sharan Toi rivers we consider that it is not only unnecessary but impracticable to erect boundary pillars. The centre of the flowing stream of the Kundar and Kundil rivers forms in itself a well defined and natural boundary, and any boundary pillars erected along this line would be liable to be carried away by floods. Clause No. 2 .—From the junction of the Sharan Toi and Kundil rivers the boundary line, which we have mutually agreed to, follows the centre of the river bed of the Sharan Toi river upwards from its junction with the Kundil about one and a quarter miles to boundary pillar No. I, which has been erected on a rocky knoll on the south bank of the Sharan Toi river. From thence it runs north west in a straight line to bound the pillar No. 2, which has been built on a promi nent peak on the east bank of the river at the lower entrance of the Tangi through which the river issues on to the plain. Thence it runs northward to boundary pillar No. II (1), which is on a conspicuous peak on the west bank of the river at the upper entrance of the same Tangi. Thence it runs in a straight line northwards to boundary pillar No. Ill, which have been erected on the top of a prominent peak, known as Orzal Ghara, which is situated between the two main branches of the Sharan Toi river, i.e., the Sara Chahan nullah and its branches on the west and the Ghbargai nullah and its branches on the east. From boundary pillar No. Ill, i.e., Orzal Ghara, the boundary line runs west wards in a straight line to boundary pillar No. IV on a conspicuous peak of theAfghanistan—no. xvi—1895. 263 Pmakai range, and thence runs north-west in a straight line to boundary pillar No. V, which has been erected on the most northern of a line of high prominent peaks which form the southern branch of the Shahghar range.

Ill, IV, V, follows approximately the watershed bet ween the Orzal Ghara and Shahghar of the water which drains to the north and east and the water which drains to the south and west. From boundary pillar No. V, the boundary line then runs south-west follow ing the crest of the line of peaks, which form the southern branch of the Shahghar range. Pillars Nos. V (1), V (2) and VI have been erected on prominent peaks of this line. Pillar No. VI is on the top of the most southern peak of this branch, which here juts out into the Kosaka plain. From pillar No. VI, the boundary line runs westwards in a straight line to boundary pillar No. VII, which has been erected on a conspicuous knoll situated about 450 yards almost due north of the old Lowana and Taraki fort commonly known as Killa Zara, and about eight hundred and fifty yards from the nearest point of the northern bank of the Tirwah river. Clause No. 3 .—With regard to the boundary line from boundary pillar No. VII, considerable difficulty has been experienced by us at arriving at a settlement owing to the joint ownership by the Shabeh Khel Tarakis and Lowanas of the Tirwah lands. By an ancient settlement of very many years ago, which these two tribes had agreed upon between themselves, the water of the Tirwah canal was divided by agreement into 21 shares, i.e., 21 Shabana roz, as follows, i.e., twelve shares, i.e., twelve Shabana roz, were fixed as the property of the Lowanas and nine shares, i.e. nine Shabana roz, as the property of the Shabeh Khel Tarakis. This division of the water still remains in force, and we have jointly agreed that it should remain in force hereafter as before. As regards the land, the Lowanas and Shabeh Khel Tarakis were not agreed as to the boundary line separating their respective shares, and it has been neces sary for us to settle this matter. After some discussion the Lowanas and Shabeh Khel Tarakis agreed to settle their boundary by oath. The joint agreement re corded by them is attached to this agreement. Oath was given by the Lowanas to the Shabeh Khel Taraki maliks, Ghulam Rasul, son of Gul Khan, and Sadik, son of Alam Khan, who, taking the Koran, marked out their boundary, from the point where the Tirwah canal leaves the bank of the Tirwah river near Killa Zara. We have jointly agreed to this settlement of the boundary line thus ar rived at, between the Lowanas and Shabeh Khel Tarakis. We have also jointly agreed to the following matters connected with the other right above named, of the Shabeh Khel Tarakis and Lowanas, i.e., (1) the joint rights to the water of the Tirwah river of the two tribes, Lowanas and Shabeh Khel Tarakis, residing in Tirwah, as far as the head of the water jointly owned by these two tribes, i.e., up to the place which is known by the name of Wruskai Karbore, i.e., the western point of the Karbore hill, above which point the Lowanas and Tarakis have no concern, will be according to the following shares— viz., the Lowanas to have twelve Shabana roz, and the Tarakis nine Shabana roz as hithertowMmmKRMMMBNSMMHM mmm 264 AFGHANISTAN—NO. XVT—1895. from ancient tinier. Both tribes shall be responsible for the clearing of the water canal according to ancient custom and according to the above-mentioned shares. (2) Neither of the parties, i.e., neither Lowanas nor Tarakis, shall, independently of each other, or against the wishes of each other, make a new course any where as far as the point where the old water canal ends in the cultivated land, i.e., the point where boundary pillar No. A. Ill has been erected, for the old water canal of Tirwah, which passes through the Lowana and Taraki lands. (3) The thorough fare of both these tribes, i.e., Lowanas and Shabeh Khel Tarakis, through any place where there may be no cultivation, will be allowed in any direction within the Taraki and Lowana boundaries in Tirwah. We have jointly agreed that the boundary line between the lands of the above two tribes should be the boundary line between the territories of our respective Governments. This boundary line runs as follows :—Starting from boundary pillar No. VII it runs southwards in a straight line about three hundred and eighty yards to a boundary pillar No. A I on the north bank of the Tirwah joint canal opposite Killa Zara, which is situated a few yards away on the other side of the canal. Thence it Jollows the line of the joint canal as far as boundary pillar No. A II, which has been built on the south bank at the point where present culti vation commences. Thence it runs eastwards along the same joint canal as far as boundary pillar No. A III, which has been built at the point where the existing joint canal ceases. From here it runs eastwards in almost a straight line to a prominent peak on the Ghwaimar hill, where boundary pillar No. A IV has been built. Between boundary pillars A III and A IV five smaller boundary marks A III (1), A III (2), A III (3), A III (4), A III (5) have been made to mark the line of boundary as laid down by the maliks on oath. From pillar A IV the boundary line runs south-westwards in a straight line to a southern peak of the Ghwaimar hill where a boundary pillar No. A V has been erected. From here it runs westwards in a straight line to a rockly prominence on east bank of the Tirwah river where boundary pillar A VI has been erected. The boundary line then runs upwards along the centre of the bed of the Tirwah river until it arrives opposite to the point at which the Tirwah canal turns off from the bank of the Tirwah river near Killa Zara. At this point boundary pillar No. A VI(1) has been erected on the south bank of the Tirwah river. The boundary line here leaves the river and goes west in a straight line two hundred and eight yards to boundary pillar No. A VI (2) erected on a knoll. From here the boundary hue runs in a straight line north-westwards up a spur of the Sraghar hill to boundary pillar No. \ III and thence up the same spur in a straight line to boundary pillar No. IX, which is on the top. of the most northern of the high peaks of the Sraghar range. From here the boundary line runs in a straight line west five miles to boundary pillar No. B 1 erected in the plain and thence in a straight line north-west for two and two-fifth miles to boundary pillar No. B II erected on a small prominent hill. From here the boundary line runs in a straight line to Khizr Chah (well) and from Khizr Chah (well) in a straight line north-westwards to oundary pillar No. XI, which is built on the top of a prominent hill locallyAFGHANISTAN—NO. XYI—1895. 265 called Roza Klmrak. The boundary pillar No. X which should have been built at Khizr Chah (well), has not been erected there owing to the low lying position of the land round Khizr Chah, but has been built outside the British boundary on the top of a prominent hill two hundred and fifty-eight yards north-east of Khizr Chah in order that it may be seen from the boundary pillar on the Sraghar moun tain, and that on Roza Khurak. The old karezes and cultivated lands belonging to the Tarakis on the Tirkha nullah and elsewhere between Sraghar and Khizr. Ohah are thus left on the north of the boundary line marked by pillars Nos. IX, BI, B II, and the pillar marking Khizr Chah, i.e., No. X, and are, therefore, included in Afghan territory. We have agreed that the Khizr Chah (well) should be open to all persons whether living in British or Afghan territory. From boundary pillar No. XI, it runs north-west in a straight line W boundary pillar No. XII, which has been erected on a prominent peak of a southern spur of the Inzlan range. Clause No. 4.—We have jointly agreed that from boundary pillar No. XII, the boundary line runs south-westwards in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XIII erected on a prominent knoll on the edge of the Surzangal plain. From here it runs south-westwards in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XIV which has been erected on the east bank of the Kand river between the Inzlan and Multani hills. From this point the boundary line follows the centre of the river bed of the Kand river, which forms a well defined natural boundary as far as the junc tion of the Loe Wuchobai nullah and the Kand river, some two milos east of Rashid Killa. Boundary pillar No. XV has been erected on the east bank of the Loe Wuchobai nullah, at the point where it joins the Kand river. We have jointly agreed that the Kakars should continue to enjoy, as hitherto, the right of grazing over the tract of land named Man Zakai, situated on the north bank of the Kand river between Rashid Killa and Ata Muhammad Killa. We have also jointly agreed that the water of the Kand river belongs jointly to the subjects of the British Government and His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan. The Afghan subjects have the right of repairing and maintaining their existing bands at Tang Bara, and the two Anizai Wastas and Wand, for the purpose of irrigating their lands on the north bank of the Kand. Should subjects of either the British Government or His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan wish to erect a new band in the Kand river, they must first obtain the permission of the district officers, who may be concerned, of both Governments. Clause No. 5.—We have jointly agreed that from boundary pillar No. XV the boundary line leaves the Kand river and runs along the east bank of the Loc Wuchobai nullah, through boundary pillar No. XV (I), to boundary pillar No. XVI, which has been erected on a small knoll on the east bank of the nullah. From here the boundary line leaves the bank of the Loe Wuchobai nullah and runs in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XVII, which has been built at a distance d three quarters of a mile to the east of the Loe Wuchobai nullah on a prominent266 AFGHANISTAN—NO. XVI—1895. knoll. From here the boundary line runs in a straight line crossing the Loe Wuchobai nullah to boundary pillar No. XVIII, which has been erected on the watershed between the Tanda and Loe Wuchobai nullahs. From No. XVIII, the boundary line runs in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XIX, which has been erected on a prominent peak on the main watershed between the nullahs flowing into the Loe Wuchobai nullah on one side and the nullahs flowing into the Tanda nullah on the other. The boundary line then runs eastwards and then southwards along the crest of this watershed through boundary pillars Nos. XIX (1) and XIX (2) erected on prominent peaks to boundary pillar No. XIX (3), which is also on a prominent peak of the same watershed. From boundary pillar No. XIX (3) the boundary line turns eastwards and runs, as shewn in the map attached, in a straight line through boundary pillar No. XX to boundary pillar No. XXI, which has been erected about a quarter of a mile to the east of the main branch of the Tirkha nullah on the edge of the Pinakai plain. From here the boundary line crosses the western extremity of the Pinakai plain, and runs south- eastwards in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XXII, which has been erected on a prominent peak of the mountain lying between the Alajirgha and Grhazluna nullahs. From thence it runs in a straight line to pillar No. XXIII, erected on a knoll in the plain between the above two nullahs. From here it runs southwards in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XXIV, which has been erected between and at the junction of the Alajirgha and Ghazluna nullahs. From here the bound ary line follows the centre of the Psein Lora. Pillars Nos. XXIV (1), XXIV (2), and XXI\ (3) have been erected to more clearly mark the course of this river. From boundary pillar XXIV (3), the course of the Psein Lora is naturally clearly defined and further boundary pillars have been considered unnecessary. The bound ary line follows the Psein Lora, which, from the junction of the Tokarak river, is known as the Kadanai river, and runs along the centre of the river bed of the Psein Lora and Kadanai for nearly thirty-nine miles to boundary pillar No. XXV, which has been erected on the south bank of the river on a prominent knoll about one mile above the junction of the Loe Ghbargai nullah with the Kadanai river. Here the boundary line turns westwards and leaves the Kadanai river. We have also jointly agreed on the following matters relating to the portion of the boundary line defined in this clause : Firstly, that the rights attaching to the Psein land which is within Afghanistan and close to and to the west of boundary pillars Nos. XVI, XVII, and XVIII of water from the Kakars, who own the right to the water of the Loe Wuchobai nullah above that, will remain as hitherto. Secondly, that the Kakar Tribe should continue to enjoy the rights of grazing, as hitherto, throughout the country lying between the Kand river, and Loe Wu chobai nullah, and Babakr Chahan and Sam Narai. rkmUy, that the Pseins should continue to enjoy the right of grazing, as hither to, in the tract of land commonly known as Psein Dagh, which is situated on the south of the Psein Lora.AFGHANISTAN—NO. XVI—1895. 267 Fourthly, that the water of the Psein Lora and Kadanai river belongs jointly to the people residing on both banks of the river. If any of the subjects of the British or Afghan Governments wish to construct a new water channel leading from the Psein Lora or Kadanai river, they must first obtain the permission of the district officers concerned of both Governments. Clause No. 6 .—We have jointly agreed that the boundary line leaves the Kadanai river at boundary pillar No. XXV, and runs westwards in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XXVI, and thence in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XXVII, and thence in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XXVIII, which has been erected on a conspicuous knoll on the south bank of the Kadanai river. The boundary line turning north-westwards crosses the Kadanai river and ascends the hills on the north of the river in a straight line up the spur which forms the western watershed of the Kalagai nullah to boundary pillar No. XXIX, which has been erected on a conspicuous knoll on that watershed. Thence the line runs in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XXX, which has been erected on the southern watershed of the Kalaka nullah. The boundary line now turns west wards and runs along the crest of the southern watershed of the Kalaka nullah through boundary pillars No. XXXI, XXXII to pillar No. XXXIII. Beyond pillar No. XXXIII the boundary line leaves the watershed of the Kalaka nullah and runs along the crest of the watershed dividing the two Sarghash Luna nullahs through boundary pillars Nos. XXXIV and XXXV. Here the line crosses the southern Sarghash Luna nullah and runs in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XXXVI, which has been erected on a conspicuous knoll on the south of that nullah. From here again turning westwards the line runs in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XXXVII, which has been erected on the east bank of the Kadanai river. From here crossing the Kadanai river the boundary line runs in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XXXVIII, which has been erected on a conspicuous peak on the south bank of the Kadanai river opposite the junction of the Kadanai river and the Kalaka nullah. At this pillar the boundary line turns south-westwards and runs for about one and three-quarter miles along a well defined watershed through pillar No. XXXIX to pillar No. XL, which has been erected on a conspicuous peak of the Asdabra hills. Then turning north-westwards the boundary line runs along a well defined watershed for about one and a quarter miles through boundary pillars Nos. XLI, XLII to No. XLIII, which has been erected on the south bank of the Kadanai river. From pillar No. XLIII the boundary line runs along the centre of the river bed of the Kadanai river for about one mile to boundary pillar No. XLIV, which has been erected on a conspicuous knoll on the south bank of the Kadanai river. Thence it runs in a straight line crossing the Kadanai river to boundary pillar No. XLV, erected on a knoll on the north bank of the Kadanai river. Then it ascends the hills on the north of that river in a straight line to boundary pillar No, XLVI, and thence in a straight line to boundary pillar No. XLVII, which hag268 AFGHANISTAN—NO. XVI—1895. been erected on a conspicuous peak on the watershed between the Tsah and Minjai nullahs on the west and the Tanga nullah on the east. The boundary line thence follows the crest of this watershed through pillar No. XLVIII to pillar No. XLIX Thence turning northwards it follows the crest of the watershed of the Tsah nullah to boundary pillar No. L, which is on a conspicuous peak on the crest of the water shed between the nullahs flowing into the Kadanai river on the south and the Salasun river on the north. The boundary line now runs along the crest of this watershed through boundary pillars Nos. LI, LII to pillar No. LIII, which has been erected on a high conspicuous peak commonly known as Manik Suka. From pillar No. LIII the boundary line runs along the crest of the well defined water shed between the Khwara and Shishga and Shahidan nullahs on the south and the nullahs flowing into the Simsalah nullah on the north, through boundary pillar No. LIV to boundary pillar No. LV. From here the boundary line runs along the crest of the southern watershed of the Loe Manah nullah to the head of the Dori nullahs. It then runs along the crest of the watershed between two of the three Dori nullahs, i.e., the western and middle of the three Dori nullahs through bound ary pillars Nos. LV I, L\ II and LYIII to the junction of the western and middle Dori nullahs. It then follows the centre of the river bed of this nullah for a short distance to its junction with the Kadanai river. From here the boundary line crossing the Kadanai river runs in a straight line to boundary pillar No. LIX, erected on a conspicuous knoll on the south of the Kadanai river and to the east of the junction of the Tozana nullah and Kadanai river. It then ascends the hills and runs along the crest of the eastern and southern watershed of the Tozana nullah through boundary pillars Nos. LIX (1) LX, LXI, LXII, to LXIII to pillar No. LXIV. From here the line runs along the southern watershed of the Wala nullah to pillar No. LX\ , which has been erected on a conspicuous peak on the crest of the watershed of the main range, which is the northern continuation of the Khwaja Amran range, and which here separates the drainage flowing into the Kadanai river on the west and into l oba on the east. The boundary line turning south wards follows the crest of this main watershed and runs through boundary pillars Nos. LXV I, LXVII, LX\ III, LXIX, LXX, and LXXI, all erected on conspicu ous peaks. The line then continues to run along the crest of the watershed and, passing through pillar No. LXXII, which has been erected on the crest of the Psha Kotal, it runs along the watershed to pillar No. LXXIII, erected on a high conspi cuous peak immediately south of that Kotal. From here the boundary line runs in a straight line which has been marked by pillars Nos. LXXIV, LXXV, LXXVI, LXXVI (1), LXXVII, LXXVIII, erect ed on conspicuous peaks and knolls to pillar No. LXXIX, which has been erected on a conspicuous peak above the upper Sherobo spring. From here the boundary line runs in a straight line through pillars Nos. LXXX, LXXXI, LXXXII, LXXXIII, LXXXIV, LXXXV, LXXXVI, LXXXVIJ,AFGHANISTAN—NO.

Your Excellency, As a result of the negotiations which have taken place between our two Gov* ernments in regard to the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Russia in the country to the east of Lake ^ ictoria (Zor Koul), the following points have been agreed upon between us :— 1. The spheres of influence of Great Britain and Russia to the east of Lake \ ictoria (Zor Koul) shall be divided by a line which, starting from a point on that ake near to its eastern extremity, shall follow the orests of the mountain range running somewhat to the south of the latitude of the lake as far as the Bendersky and Orta-Bel passes.AFGHANISTAN—NO. XVTI—1895. 271 From thence the line shall run along the same range while it remains to the south of the latitude of the said lake. On reaching that latitude it shall des cend a spur of the range towards Kizil Rabat on the Aksu river, if that locality is found not to be north of the latitude of Lake Victoria, and from thence it shall be prolonged in an easterly direction so as to meet the Chinese frontier. If it should be found that Kizil Rabat is situated to the north of the latitude of Lake Victoria, the line of demarcation shall be drawn to the nearest conve nient point on the Aksu river, south of that latitude, and from thence prolonged as aforesaid. 2. The line shall be marked out, and its precise configuration shall be settled by a Joint Commission of a purely technical character, with a military escort not exceeding that which is strictly necessary for its proper protection. The Commission shall be composed of British and Russian Delegates, with the necessary technical assistance. Her Britannic Majesty’s Government will arrange with the Amir of Afghanistan as to the manner in which His Highness shall be represented on the Commission. 3. The commission shall also be charged to report any facts which can be ascertained on the spot bearing on the situation of the Chinese frontier, with a view to enable the two Governments to come to an agreement with the Chinese Government as to the limits of Chinese territory in the vicinity of the line, in such manner as may be found most convenient. 4. Her Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Government of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia engage to abstain from exercising any political influence or control—the former to the north, the latter to the south—of the above line of demarcation. 5. Her Britannic Majesty’s Government engage that the territory lying within the British sphere of influence between the Hindu Kush and the line running from the east end of Lake Victoria to the Chinese frontier shall form part of the territory of the Amir of Afghanistan ; that it shall not be annexed to Great Britain ; and that no military posts or forts shall be established in it. The execution of this agreement is contingent upon the evacuation by the Amir of Afghanistan of all the territories now occupied by His Highness on the right bank of the Panja, and on the evacuation by the Amir of Bokhara of the portion of Darwaz which lies to the south of the Oxus, in regard to which Her Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Government of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia have agreed to use their influence respectively with the two Amirs. I shall be obliged if, in acknowledging the receipt of this note, V our Excel lency will record officially the agreement which we have thus concluded m the name of our respective Governments. i 2AFGHANISTAN—NO.

J’ai. etc., Staal. No. XIX. Translation of Joint Agreement executed by the joint British and Afghan Commissioners of the Indo-Afghan Boundary Commission, 1896. We, the undersigned, Commissioners, deputed by our respective Governments to demarcate the boundary hue between the territories of the Government of India and of His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan, westwards, from new Chaman to the Persian border, have arrived at the following mutual agreement regarding that boundary fine :— Clause No. The boundary line to which we have mutually agreed runs from boundary pillar No. XCII, erected at a point half-way between the new Chaman railway station and the Mian Baidak hill, in a straight line in the direction of the Ghwazha outpost. This line has been marked by boundary pillars Nos. XCII, XCIII, XCIV, XCV, XCVI, XCVII, XCVIII, XCIX, C, Cl, CII, CHI, CIV, cv, CVI, CVII, CVIII, CIX, CX, CXI, CXII, CXIII, CXIV to CXIV (1), which has been erected a few yards on the west, i.e., Afghan side of the road commonly known as the Sina Lar which goes from Ghwazha towards Chaman. The boundary hne, leaving this road within British territory, runs a few yards at a short distance to the west of, i.e., on the Afghan side of, that road to boundary pillar No. CXV which has been erected at a point at a distance of half a mile on the Chaman side of the Ghwazha outpost. From here the boundary hne runs in a straight line to pillar No. CXVI which has been erected at a point half mile due west of the Ghwazha outpost. Thence it runs in a straight line to boundary pillar N o. CXVIL which has been erected at a point half mile south of the Ghwazha outpost and274 AFGHANISTAN—NO. XIX—1896. yards on the east, i.e., the British side of the road running from Ghwazha to Shorawak. With regard to the water of the Iskamkanr and Ghwazha nullahs we have jointly agreed that the owners of that water should continue to enjoy the same right to that water as they now do, and the owners of that water whether they be in British or Afghan territory should continue, as hitherto, to enjoy the owner ship of that water. No one else should interfere with either water. Clause No. II .—We have jointly agreed that from boundary pillar No. CXVII the boundary line runs, as shown on the attached map, in a straight line south wards and slightly eastwards about one and a quarter miles to boundary pillar Iso. CXVIII erected on a small prominent knoll about three quarters of a mile from the road leading from Ghwazha to Shorawak commonly known as the Sila Lar. The boundary line then runs in a straight line southwards and slightly westwards to boundary pillar No. CXIX erected on a small knoll about half a mile to the east of the Sina Lar. It thence runs in a straight line in the same direction to boundary pillar No. CXX erected on a small knoll half a mil e, from uliu oiiia, uai uu me in Pers^a^Agreemen *^ ari ^ nu ^ a ^- From here the boundary line runs in a straight line south-eastwards across the Wuchdarra nullah to boundary pillar No. CXXI erected on a prominent knoll on the south bank of the Wuchdarra nullah on the spur which forms the southern watershed of that nullah. It thence runs in a south-eastward direction up along the crest of the southern watershed of the Wuchdarra nullah and its branches as demarcated by boundary pillars Nos.

The boundary line now turns southwards and slightly westwards and runs along the crest of the main watershed of the Khwaja Am ran range through boundary pillars Nos. CXXXI, CXXXII, CXXXIII, erected on peaks on that crest to oundary pillar No. CXXXIV, erected on a peak of the crest which marks the head of the Inzar and Kargu nullahs which flow into the Shista nullah. The oundary line thence runs down the southern watershed of the Inzar nullah, through boundary pillars Nos. CXXXV, CXXXVI, and CXXXVII, into the bed i®ta nullah. The boundary line from here follows the centre of the bed ° t e b ista nullah until its junction with the Lora. It then follows the centre °, ^ 6 ^ atercourse of the Lora for a short distance down the Lora to the junction 0 e G ia daira nullah and the Lora.

From boundary pillar No. CXXXIX, which has been erected on a peak on the Sarlat watershed half-way between the head of the pass known as the Psha Pass and the head of the pass known as the Ashtarlak or Shutarlak Pass, the boundary line leaves the crest of the Sarlat watershed and runs south-eastwards in a straight line across the upper branches of the Sokhta nullah to boundary pillar No. CXL, which has been erected on a peak of the range which is here commonly known as Yahya Band which forms here the eastern watershed of the Sokhta nullah and its upper branches.

Beyond this point, as far as boundary pillar No. CLVII, boundary pillars have not been erected owing to the sand. This straight line,' from boundary pillar No. CXLIV to boundary pillar No. CLVII, passes about one mile south of the hill known as Jari Mazar, about two miles south of Siah ^ang, about 7| miles south of the Sayd Buzziarat and about 1£ miles south of the Paprang Band. After entering the sand-hills, of Registan at boundary pillar CLVI, some 400 yards south of Partos Nawar, the boundary line runs in a straight line through sand-hills to boundary pillar No. CLVII, which, as before mentioned, has been erected at a point two miles due south of the top of the small n close to and south of the Kani well. From boundary pillar No. CLVII, the boundary line, which we have jointly agreed upon, runs in a straight line west wards and slightly northwards to the Shibian Kotal. This line crosses the north portion of the Lora Hamun. Boundary pillar No. CLVIII has been erected on the hue at about U miles north of the Kunzai hill which is situated on the west bank of the Lora Hamun.

The boundary line then leaves this main watershed and runs north west for about 3f miles along the crest of a spur, which separates the main, i.e., northern branch of the Barabchah nullah, from the southern branches as far as boundary pillar No. CLXIY, which has been erected on a prominent peak at the end of that spur. From here the boundary line runs in a straight line westwards and slightly northwards for about 29 miles to boundary pillar No. CLXXII, which has been erected at a point six miles due south of Robat. Along this straight line, to mark the boundary, boundary pillars Nos. CLXV, CLXYI, CLXVII, CLXVIII, CLXIX, CLXX, CLXXI, have been erected at prominent points, as shown on the attached map. From boundary pillar No. CLXXII, the boundary line, turning westwards and slightly southwards, runs in a straight line, except for a short distance at Jilijil, as noted below, to a point 12 miles due north of Amir Chah, through boundary pillars Nos. CLXXIII, CLXXIY, CLXXV and CLXXVI, as shown on the map attached. Boundary pillar No. CLXXY is situated on a hill known as Bar close to and north of the Chah-i-Marak. Boundary pillar No. CLXX\ I is at the foot of the southern slopes of the hill known as Lorai which is on the north bank of the nullah known as Chah-i-Marak nullah. From boundary pillar No. GLXX\ I, the boundary line turns due south and runs to a distance of half a mile to the south of the bed of the large nullah in which Soru and Jilijil are situated. The Soru water is thus left on the British side and the Jilijil water on the Afghan side of the boundary line. The line then runs along the sand-hills at a distance of ^ a mile to the south of the bed of the above nullah to a point near Khaisan Lok where the main road from Jilijil to Darband leaves this nullah. Here the boundary line joins and thence runs along the straight line drawn between boundary pillar No. CLXXII and boundary pillar No. CLXXVII erected at a point 12 miles due north of Amir Chah. This line passes through the north slopes of a prominent sand-hill known as Khaisan Lok and passes about 2-| miles south of The top of the Kamarghar hill, about three miles south of the top of O ld an Koh, about 2 2 miles south of the top of Harrag hill, about eight miles north of Darband and about seven miles north of the top of the Gharibo hill. Owing to the heavy sand along its course it has not been possible to demarcate the boundary line beyond Soru by boundary pillars. Clause No. 7.—We have jointly agreed that from boundary pillar No. CLXXVII, erected at the point 12 miles due north of Amir Chah, the boundary line runs in a straight line north-west, as shown in the attached map, for about 97 miles to the top of the Koh-i-Malik Siah. As this boundary line runs through sand and desert it has been considered unnecessary to demarcate it for some distance by boundary pillars. It passes about 22 miles north of the Koh-i-Dalil, about 20^ miles north of Drana Koh, about 10 miles north of the Garuk-i-Gori hill, about 16| miles north of the Kirtaka spring. It passes about 1| miles south of the most southern point of the God-i-Zirreh, about 8 miles south of the ruins of five old buildings, which are situated in a row a short distance to the south of the Shelag278 AFGHANISTAN—NO.

Between the point where this boundary line leaves the sand hills and the top of the Koh-i-Malik Siah the following boundary pillars have been erected on this straight line, as shown in the attached map : i.e., boundary pillars Nos. CLXXYIII, CLXXIX, CLXXX, CLXXXI, and CLXXXII, on the plain; No. CLXXXIII on a conspicuous ridge of the low hills south of the Robat nullah; No. CLXXXIV on the south bank of the Robat nullah ; No. CLXXXV on the north bank of the Robat nullah. From there the line crosses the eastern slopes of the Koh-i-Robat and runs up to boundary pillar No. CLXXXVI, which has been erected on the top of the Koh-i-Malik Siah. This line crosses the Robat nullah just above the lower Robat springs and leaves the upper Robat spring some 2^ miles on the south of it.

Usual ending. Final Arbitral Statement on the Seistan Boundary by Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.I., C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission, dated 1st February 1905. 1. The boundary line between Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan was defined in my arbitral award of November 1903 as follows :— “ The boundary line in Seistan between Afghanistan on the east and Persia on the west should run as follows, i.e., from the Malik Siah Koh in a straight line to the Bandi-i-Kuhak and thence along the bed of the Helmund river to the point of separation* of its two branches, the Rud-i-Parian and Nad Ali channel. From there it should follow the bed of the Nad Ali channel into the Sikhsar and along the bed of Sikhsar to a point near Deh Yar Muhammad where the Sikhsar has been diverted towards the west in the water channel shown on the map which joins the Shela-i-Shamshiri near to Deh Hassan Kharot. The boundary line should follow the left bank of this water channel to the Shela-i-Shamshiri leaving Deh Hassan Kharot on the east. It should then run in a straight line separating the hamlets of Deh Ali Mardan on the west from Deh Ali Jangi on the east to Tappa-i-Tilai; thence in a straight hue to the most western of the mounds of Tappa-i-Shaharaki; thence in a straight line to the most western mound of Tappa-i-Kurki; thence in a straight line to Shalghami, and thence in a straight line to Siah Koh, Bandan.” 2. The above award having been accepted by both Governments, I have now demarcated the boundary line by boundary pillars in strict accordance with that word. The following remarks will clearly explain the boundary hue and the manner in which that line has been demarcated by pillars. * The word “ junction ” was used in my original award, and is now replaced by the more correct term “ point of separation.”280 AFGHANISTAN—NO. XX—1905 3. The starting point of the boundary line is marked by a boundary pillar on the summit of Malik Siah Koh which was constructed by the Afghan-Balu- chistan Boundary Commission in 1896 and is known as Boundary Pillar No. 186 of that Commission. The latitude and longitude of this and all other Seistan boundary pillars, the position of each with regard to prominent places visible from them, and all necessary particulars of their size and construction are fully stated in the list of boundary pillars attached to this statement. 4. The position of each boundary pillar is also clearly shown in the two maps attached to this. 5. From the top of Malik Siah Koh to the Band-i-Kuhak (also called Band-i- Seistan) the straight line of boundary has been marked by 51 pillars. As these are all in exactly one straight line a further description of each is unnecessary; and it suffices to say that No. 12 is on the south bank of the Shela, No. 36 on the north bank of the Sana rud, and No. 51 on the left bank of the Helmund river where the Bud-i-Seistan leaves that river at the Band-i-Kuhak. Between pillars Nos. 8 and 9 and between Nos. 12 and 13 are 3 and 8 miles respectively of heavy sand through which it was not possible to demarcate the line with pillars. Besides these 51 pillars there are 16 smaller marks also exactly on the straight line. The positions and particulars of these are stated in the attached list of pillars. They bear the following numbers in that list:—13A, 14A, 15A, 16A, 17A, 18A, 18B, 18C, 21A, 23A, 23B, 25A, 25B, 26A, 32A, 43A, but in order to prevent confusion with boundary pillars they have been shown in the map attached to this only as small black dots without numbers. 6 . From the Band-i-Kuhak demarcation with pillars was unnecessary along the course of the Helmund river as far as the point of separation of the Rud-i- Pariun and Nad Ali branches of that river. To mark this point pillar No. 52 has been built at a distance of 94 feet from the left, i.e., Persian bank of the Nad Ali channel, and pillar No. 53 has been built at a distance of 65 feet from the right or Afghan bank of the same channel. The boundary line thence follows the Nad Ali channel. The old ruin of Burj-i-As marks the right bank of that channel near Nad Ali, and pillar No. 54 marks the right bank at the point where the Shela-i-Charakh leaves that channel. From pillar No. 54 the Nad Ali channel is known as the Sikhsar. Pillar No. 55 marks the left bank of the Sikhsar at the point where the Deh Dost Muhammad canal takes off from it, while pillar No. 56 also marks the left bank at the point where the Sikhsar again turns northwards. Pillar No. 57 has been built on a prominent mound called Tappa-i-Sikhsar w'hich is situated at a distance of 240 feet from the right or Afghan bank of the Sikhsar. Further north, pillar No. 58 which has been built at a distance of 109 feet from the right bank, and pillar No. 59, which is situated 20 feet from the left bank of the Sikhsar stream, mark the point where the boundary line leaves the Sikhsar as defined in my award. Pillar No. 58 is built alongside the site of Deh Yar iglareWl *As tke bom W 65, the ii note here tl mid as l ^iado.iWintltlt; Jim, « ; is us; i, No Jtii el Ipi 111151,1 .uoftitte it pilkii^ .Sis# lepilltf^ 1 ©11^ mmanBammr m ~ m —■ —— mii AFGHANISTAN—NO.

Further demarcation of the course of the Helmund river and the Nad Ali and the Sikhsar streams is at present impossible owing to the nature of the banks, which are liable to be inundated. Moreover further demarcation appears un necessary at the present time as the course of the water in those streams clearly marks the boundary. Hereafter should any of those streams dry up by reason of a change in the course of the Helmund, and cease to be water channels, their course can easily be ascertained and demarcated, if necessary, with the aid of the pillars and places above described. 8. From pillar No. 59 the course of the boundary line is demarcated by pillars Nos. 60 and 61 built on the left bank of the water channel which joins the Shela- i-Shamshiri near T)eh Hassan Kharot. Pillar No. 62 has been built to mark this point on the south bank of the Shela-i-Shamshiri close to Deh Hassan Kharot. From here the straight line to Tappa-i-Tilai has been marked by pillars Nos. 63, 64, and 65, the last named being built on the top of Tappa-i-Tilai. It is necessary to note here that the villages of Deh Ali Mardan and Deh Ali Jangi mentioned in my award as being on either side of this line have been deserted since my award was delivered and neither of them now exists. 9. To illustrate the boundary line from the point of separation of the Rud-i- Pariun and Nad'Ali channels to Tappa-i-Tilai in greater detail than is possible in a map of 4 miles to one inch, a map of 1 mile to 1 inch of that portion of the boundary line is attached to this statement. 10. Pillar No. 66 has been built on the top of the most western of the Sharaki Tappas and the straight line onwards to Tappa-i-Kurki is marked by pillars Nos. 67 and 68, the latter being situated on the top of the most western of the Kurki Tappas. On the straight line between pillar No. 68 and Shalghami, which is marked by pillar No. 70, pillar No. 69 has been built. The land on which pillars Nos. 67 and 69 have been built is generally under water, but as it happened to be dry at the time of demarcation massive masonry pillars have been built at those points which it is hoped will last a long time. 11. From pillar No. 70 at Shalghami, the straight line of boundary to Siah Koh has been marked by 19 pillars, Nos. 71 to 90. Of these pillars some are built in Naizar lands subject to innundation, and every care has been taken to build them strong and massive enough to last a long time. The line from pillar No. 70 to pillar No. 76 passes 600 feet south of the^st southern edge of a promi nent Tappa called Tappa-i-Kharan, 3,223 feet soVthof)he centre of top of southern face of Tappa-i-Shaghalak, and 1,485 feet south of the highest point of Tappa-i- Musjidak. Between pillars Nos. 76 and 77 the line crosses the open water of the Hamun and demarcation was impossible. Pillar No. 77 is on the west shore of the Hamun, and the line thence ascends the barren and waterless glacis and slopes of the Siah Koh. Pillar No. 90 is on the summit of Siah Koh, which is also known282 AFGHANISTAN—NO. XXI—1905. 12. Two maps accompany this statement. One, in two sheets, is on a scale of 1 inch=4 miles and illustrates the whole boundary from Malik Siah Koh to Siah Koh. The other is on a scale of 1 inch=l mile, and illustrates the boundary between the point of separation of the Rud-i-Pariun and Nad Ali channels of the Helmund and Tappa-i-Tilai only. It should be noticed that the number of names of villages has been restricted as much as possible in these maps. This is due to the fact that most of the villages in Seistan frequently change not only their names but also their positions. En deavour has been made to show only such villages as are likely to be permanent. These maps should be considered as superseding those issued with my award of November 1903. 13. Attached to this statement is a list, already referred to, of all the boundary pillars, giving all necessary particulars of their position, size, construction, etc. 14. All measurements such as inches, feet, yards and miles in this statement and the accompanying list of boundary pillars, are English inches, feet, yards, and miles. A. H.

Arbitral award on the Seistan water question, dated the 10th April 1905. / Preliminary Remarks. Paragraph 1. —General Sir Frederick Goldsmid, as Arbitrator between Persia and Afghanistan, was called upon to settle the question of rights to land and water of Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan. He delivered an arbitral award on both points in 1872, which was confirmed by Her Majesty s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and accepted by the Persian and Afghan Governments in 1873. 2. At the time of the above award, the Helmand river had one main distribu tary channel in Seistan, i.e., the Rud-i-Seistan, at the mouth of which, in order to divert sufficient water into this Bud, was a tamarisk band known as the Band i-Kohak or Band-i-Seistan. The Helmand river from thence onwards flowed m one channel past Nad AH and along what is now known as the Sikhsar into the Naizar and Hamun. In 1896 a large flood caused the river to burst out for itself a new main channel, which left the old one near Shahgul and is now knovn as the Bud-i-Pariun. 3. Various disputes regarding water between Persian and Afghan Seistan, which were caused by changes in the course of canals and in the course of the main284 AFGHANISTAN—NO. XXII-1905. river, have arisen since 1872. My enquiries show that these have, until recently, always been mutually and amicably settled by the responsible officials concerned on both sides, i.e., the Governors of Seistan and Chakhansur. These officials, who thoroughly understood each other’s water requirements, have always shown great tact and skdl in settling water disputes to the mutual satisfaction of both countries. 4. Unfortunately of recent years, whatever may have been the cause, and whether this was due to the changes in the course of the main stream, or to more strained relations, the amicable settlement of water difficulties has been found to be no longer possible. A series of small, and in themselves unimportant, water questions arose between 1900 and 1902, which, by reason of estranged relations, caused mutual misunderstanding and increased ill-feeling, until matters were brought to a crisis by further disputes arising from abnormal deficiency of water in the Helmand in 1902. This led to the-present reference to the arbitration of the British Government. 5. The condition under which the present arbitration has been agreed to by the Governments of Persia and Afghanistan is that the award should be in accord ance with the terms of Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award. 6 . In framing my award I am, therefore, restricted by the above condition. 7. Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award on the water question was as follows It is to be clearly understood that no works are to be carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of irrigation on both banks of the Helmand.” Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in his capacity as the final confirming authority of that award further laid down in 1873 after consulting General Goldsmid, that the above clause should not be understood to apply either to existing canals or to old or disused canals that it may be desired 0 put in proper repair, nor would it interfere with the excavation of new canals, provided that the requisite supply on both banks is not diminished. 8 . The above award is so definite that it is unnecessary to make any attempt to define it further, except on one particular point. This award provides that Fersia has a right to a requisite supply of water for irrigation. In order to prevent future misunderstandings, it only remains to define what amount of water fairly represents a requisite supply for Persian requirements. u ^ivr- Care ^ an&lt; ^ ex h a ustive measurements, observations, and enquiries made by this Mission in Seistan, the following facts have been clearly established . {a) Sei f an suffe rs more from excess than deficiency of water. Far more loss is caused by damage done to land and crops year after year by floods, than is caused by want of water for irrigation. 1 ^ L^ n ° n ^ ^ er y f ew exce ptional abnormal years of low river has any question o sufficiency of water arisen in Seistan, and then Afghan Seistan has suffered equa y with Persian Seistan. Moreover, questions as to the sufficiency of water on y prove serious when the spring crop cultivation is concerned, when the river owest, ^,e., between the autumn and spring equinoxes, yet it has beenAFGHANISTAN—NO. XXII—1905. 285 ascertained that in only 3 out of the past 35 years has there been any serious deficiency of water in Seistan during that season. It is necessary, therefore, first to consider water requirements during the season of spring crops. Any settlement based on the requirements of that season will meet the case of the re mainder of the year also. (c) After carefully calculating the normal volume of the Helmand river during the period between the autumn equinox and the spring equinox it has been clearly ascertained that one-third of the water which now reaches Seistan at Bandar-i- Kamal Khan would amply suffice for the proper irrigation of all existing cultivation in Persian Seistan, and also allow of a large future extension of that cultivation, This would leave a requisite supply for all Afghan requirements. 10, I therefore give the following award AWABD. Clause I .—No irrigation works are to be carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of water for irrigation on both banks of the river but both sides have the right, within their own territories, to maintain existing canals, to open out old or disused canals, and to make new canals, from the Helmand river, provided that the supply of water requisite for irrigation on both sides is not diminished. Clause II .—The amount of water requisite for irrigation of Persian lands irrigable from and below the Band-i-Kohak is one-third of the whole volume of the Helmand river which enters Seistan. Seistan, to which Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award applies, comprises all.lands on both banks of the Helmand from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan downwards. Clause III .—Persia is, therefore, entitled to one-third of the whole Helmand River calculated at the point where water is first taken off from it to irrigate lands on either bank situated at or below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. Clause IV .—Any irrigation works constructed by Afghanistan to divert water into Seistan lands, as above defined, must allow of at least one-third of the volume of the whole river being available for Persian use at Band-i-Kohak. Clause F.—To enable both sides to satisfy themselves that this award is being complied with, and at the same time to avoid the necessity of fresh references to the British Government and the expense of special Missions, a British officer of irrigation experience shall be permanently attached to the British Consulate in Seistan. He will be empowered to give an opinion, when required by either party, on any case of doubt or dispute over water questions that may arise. He will, when necessary, take steps to bring the real facts of any case to the notice of the Government concerned. He will be able also to call the attention of either party to any important indications of threatening danger to their water-supply arising from natural causes or their own irrigation works. To enable this officer properly to fulfill the functions of bis office, free access shall be given to him by either side to the Helmand river and its branches and the heads of canals leading therefrom.286 AFGHANISTAN—NO. XXIIT—1919. Clause VI. —The maintenance of the Band-i-Kohak is of great importance t o the welfare of Persian Seistan. It is possible that the deepening of the river bed at and below the site of the present band may necessitate moving the band a short distance further up the river. Afghanistan should allow Persia to move this band, if necessary, and grant Persia the right to excavate the short canal required for such new band through Afghan territory to the Bud-i-Seistan. Similarly, should it become necessary for Afghanistan to move the present Shahgul Band across the Rud-i-Pariun somewhat lower down that stream, Persia should (as has been done before) allow Afghanistan right of way for a canal through Persian territory from that band to the Nad Ali Channel. Clause VII. —It will be noted that the rights to the Helmand river which her geographical position naturally gives to Afghanistan as owner of the Upper Helmand, have been restricted to the extent stated above in favour of Persia in accordance with Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award. It follows, therefore, that Persia has no right to alienate to any other Power the water rights thus acquired without the consent of Afghanistan. Clause VIII. —I cannot close this award without a word of warning do both countries concerned. The past history of the Helmand river in Seistan shows that it has always been subject to sudden and important changes in its course, which have from time to time diverted the whole river into a new channel and rendered useless all the then existing canal systems. Such changes are liable to occur in the future, and great care should, therefore, be exercised in the opening out of new canals, or the enlargement of old canals leading from the Helmand. Unless this is done with proper precaution, it may cause the river to divert itself entirely at such points and cause great loss to both countries. This danger applies equally to Afghanistan and Persia. Camp Kohak, A. H. McMahon, Colonel, The 10th April 1900. British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Commission. No. XXIII.

Article 5. The Afghan Government accept the Indo-Afghan frontier accepted by the late Amir.

You have told me that the Afghan Government are unwilling to renew the arrangement whereby the late Amir agreed to follow unreservedly the advice of the British Government in re&gt; gard to his external relations. I have not, therefore, pressed this matter : and no mention of it is made in the Treaty. Therefore, the said Treaty and this letter leave Afghanistan officially free and independent in its internal and external affairs.

APPENDIX. (No. 1.) Letter from British Representative to Sardar-i-Ala, the Afghan Foreign Minister, After compliments. —With reference to the provisions contained in Article VI of the Treaty concluded between the Government of Afghanistan and the British Government regarding the importation of arms and munitions into Afghanistan through India, I have the honour to inform and assure you that, although the British Government has in that Article reserved to itself the right exercised by every nation to stop the transportation to a neighbouring country of arms and munitions, in the event of its not being assured of the friendly intentions of that country, the British Government has no desire to make trifling incidents an excuse for the stoppage of such arms and munitions. It would only be in the event of the Government of Afghanistan showing plainly by its attitude that it had deter mined on an unfriendly and provocative course of policy towards Great Britain contrary to the neighbourly Treaty above-mentioned that the latter State would exercise the right of stoppage. There is every ground for hope that such a con tingency will never arise, in view of the friendly relations which are expected to spring from the Treaty which has now been concluded. (Usual ending.)

In the name of the most merciful God ! Arising from various occurrences of late years the amicable relations between the two powerful Mahomedan States became interrupted, and their friendship and good understanding were converted into strife and enmity, which terminated in open warfare. The interests of the religion of Islam required a reconciliation, the two Governments were anxious to prevent the further effusion of blood, and the renewal of the ties of amity was mutually desired and proposed. With this view, by the authority of a Firman from His Majesty the King of Kings, the Khakan, son of a Khakan, the Conqueror Futh Ali Shah, the Sovereign of Persia, and also invested with discretionary powers from His Royal Highness, the heir-apparent, Prince Abbas Mirza the High in Dignity Mirza Mahomed Ali, Mustofee, has been honoured with the rank of Plenipotentiary, and in virtue of a Firman, His Majesty the Protector of the Faith, the Guardian of the Holy Cities, Sultan of the Sea and Earth, the Sultan, son of the Sultan, the Conqueror, Mahmood Khan, Emperor of the Ottomans, has named for His Plenipotentiary the illustrious Mahomed Ummeer Raoof Pasha, Sur Askar, Governor of Arzeeraam, and Wallee of the Eastern Provinces of the Ottoman Empire, who, on the exchange of their full powers, have concluded their conferences and discussions in the fore-mentioned city by assenting to the conditions of peace. Basis .—The stipulations of the treaty concluded in the year of the Hegira 1159 respecting the ancient boundaries of the two Empires and the former agree ments relating to the pilgrims, the delivery of refugees, the free egress for all prisoners, and the residence of a Minister at the respective Courts are considered valid, and are to be strictly observed. The slightest deviation from the engage ment therein detailed shall not be permitted, and the amity between the two power ful States shall be for ever preserved. Stimulations .—Henceforward the sword of enmity shall be sheathed, and every circumstance shall be avoided which may produce coldness or disgust, and may be contrary to friendship and perfect union. The countries within the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire, that during the war or previously to the commencement of hostility have been taken possession of by Persia, including fortresses, districts, lands, towns, and villages to be restored in their present state, and at the expira tion of sixty days from the signature of this Treaty shall be delivered over to.,the Ottoman Government. And in token of respect for this happy peace the prisoners captured on both sides, without concealment or prevention, shall have free permis sion to depart. Provisions and other necessaries requisite for the journey shall be afforded them, and they shall be sent to the frontiers of the two countries.PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. \I—1823. Article 1. The two High Powers do not admit of each other’s interference with the internal affairs of their respective States. From this period, on the side of Bagdad and Koordistan, no interference is to take place, or with any districts of the divisions of Koordistan is the Persian Government to intermeddle, or authorise any acts of molestation, or to assume any authority over the present or former possessors of those countries. And on that frontier should the tribes of either side pass the boundaries for a summer or winter residence, the Agents of his Royal Highness, the heir-apparent with the Pasha of Bagdad, shall arrange the tribute customary to be paid, the rent of the pasture lands, and other claims in order that they may not cause any misintelligence between the two Governments. Article 2. Persian subjects proceeding to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, or to other Mahomedan towns, such as pilgrims and persons travelling through the Ottoman territories, are to be entirely exempt from all contribution, whilst other imposi tions in variance with lawful usages are not to be demanded from them. In like manner, the pilgrims to Kerbela and Najuff, as long as they have no merchandise, neither tribute or tax of any kind is to be exacted from them ; but in the case that they have in their possession articles of commerce the just rate of customs is to be levied on their goods, and nothing extra is to be demanded. The Persian Government is likewise bound to pursue the same line of conduct towards the merchants and subjects of the Ottoman Empire. In conformity with former engagements from this period on the part of the Viziers, the Emir-i-Haj, and other Commanders and Governors, the ancient stipulations respecting the Persian pilgrims shall be considered in full force, and acted up to. The pilgrims shall be conducted from Damascus to the holy cities, from thence to Damascus, and on the part of the Emir-i-Haj attention shall be shown towards them, whilst no treatment in variance with the existing engagements shall be permitted ; on the contrary, every exertion shall be made to afford them aid and protection. In the case that any disputes should arise amongst the Persian Pilgrims the Emir-i-Haj, in conjunction with the chief person amongst them, is to settle their differences. To the female attendants of His Persian Majesty, the wives of the Royal Princes, or of the Grandees of the Empire, who may be on pilgrimage to Mecca or Kerbela and Nujuff, every respect and honour shall be paid according to their respective ranks. Persian merchants and subjects shall pay the same rate of customs as those of the Ottoman Government. The duties are only once to be exacted, and they shall be at a computation of four piastres from a hundred piastres on the value of the merchandise. Tescarees shall be given, and whilst the goods remain in the possession of the first proprietors and are not disposed of to other persons, no further duties are to be d&lt; manded. The Persian merchants who carry the choobooks or pipe-sticks of Shiraz to Constantinople shall be allowed to traffic them without any restrictions, and to sell them to whomsoever they may think proper. To the merchants, subjects, and dependants of the two High Powers,PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. VI—1823. ^ visiting the two countries, in consideration of the Mahomedan religion, every friendly treatment shall be extended, and they shall be protected from all molesta tion and injury. Article 3. The tribes of Hyderanloo and Sibbikee, which have been the cause of conten tion between the two High Powers, and are now dwelling in the territory of the Ottoman Empire, should they from thence transgress the boundary of Persia, and commit any ravages, the Turkish Frontier authorities must endeavour to prevent such proceedings and punish the offenders. In the case that these tribes continue to invade and molest the Persian territory, and the Frontier authorities do not put a stop to these aggressions, the Ottoman Government shall cease to protect them, and should these tribes on their own will and choice return to Persia, their departure shall not be prevented or opposed. But after their arrival in Persia should they again desert to Turkey, the Ottoman Government shall afford them no further protection, nor shall they be received. In the event of their return to Persia, should these tribes disturb the tranquillity of the Ottoman territory, the Persian Frontier authorities are obliged to use every effort to prevent these irregularities. Article 4. In conformity with ancient engagements the deserters from either country are not to be received, and in like manner from this period the wandering tribes and Eliauts quitting Persia for Turkey or Turkey for Persia are not to be afforded protection by either party. Article 5. The property of the Persian merchants sequestrated at Constantinople with the cognizance of the law, and according to the public registers from the date of t his Treaty to the period of sixty days wherever the sequestration may have taken place, shall be restored to the proprietors. Besides the goods under sequestration, whatever effects during the war may have been taken by force from the Persian pilgrims and subjects throughout the Ottoman dominions, by the different Viziers and Governors on the representations of the Persian Government, Firmans shall be granted to the agents of such persons who, on giving lawful proofs of the authenticity of the claims, shall receive the required restitution. Article 6. On the demise of any Persian subjects in the Ottoman dominions should the deceased have no lawful heir or executor present the officers of the treasury (beit al mal) shall, with the cognizance of the law, register the property, and shall enter it into the records of the Courts of Judicature. For the period of one year the effects are to be lodged in a secure place, until the lawful heir or administrator of the estate may arrive, when, according to the register of the Courts of Judica-xxu PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. VI—1823. ture, the property shall be delivered up. The customary fees and the hire of the place depositing the effects are to be paid, and should they be burnt or destroyed in the forestated period, no pretensions are to be made for the recovery of the property. If, during the forestated period, the heir or executor of the deceased does not arrive, the officers of the treasury (beit al mal), with the knowledge of the Agent of the Persian Government, are to sell the property and to keep the amount in deposit. Article 7. Agreeably to former engagements, and for the purpose of adding fresh ties to the alliance, a Minister shall be sent every three years to reside for that period at the respective Courts. The subjects of the two High Powers, who during the war may have deserted from either country, in consideration of this happy peace, shall suffer no punishment for the offence committed. Final Article. The capitulations detailed in the basis of the Treaty, in the stipulations, and different articles, which have been the result of the conferences, shall be approved of by both parties. No claim shall be advanced on account of plunder and losses, or any indemnification required for the expenses of the war, and the principle adhered to by both Governments shall be to overlook all past occurrences. According to established custom che ratifications of this Treaty shall be exchanged, and from the signature of this authentic instrument to the space of sixty days, Ambassadors of secondary rank must meet each other on the frontiers of the two countries, and from thence proceed to the Courts of the respective States for the purpose of delivering the ratified Treaty. In this manner the alliance has been renewed and confirmed, and the truest reconciliation has taken place from the date of this Treaty. No alteration shall be made in the above stipula tions and agreements or any measures hereafter pursued in repugnance to the rights of friendship. The Plenipotentiary of the Ottoman Government in virtue of his full powers has signed and sealed this Treaty on the 19th day of Zekaud in the year 1238, for which this instrument, in exact conformity thereto, has been delivered in exchange by the Plenipotentiary of His Persian Majesty agreeably to his full powers.

His Majesty the Shah of Persia reserves to Russia as formerly the right of appointing Consuls or Commercial Agents wherever the good of commerce may require, and he engages to allow these Consuls or Agents, each of whom shall not have a suite of more than ten individuals under his protection, the enjoyment of the honours and privileges due to their public character. His Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias promises on his part to observe a perfect reciprocity in regard to the Consuls or Commer cial Agents of His Majesty the Shah of Persia ; in the event of any well- grounded complaint on the part of the Persian Government against any one of the Russian Consuls or Agents, the Minister or Charge d’Affaires of Russia, residing at the Court of His Majesty the Shah, and under whose immediate orders they shall be placed, will suspend him from his functions and confer the charge provisionally on whomsoever he may think proper Article 10.

The high contracting parties will adopt the same course in regard to all prisoners of war, and all .Russian and Persian subjects reciprocally found in captivity who may not have been restored within the term above mentioned either by reason of the distance at which they may have been, or owing to any other cause or circumstances whatever. The two Governments expressly re serve to themselves the unlimited right of claiming them at any time, and they bind themselves to restore them reciprocally, as soon as they shall present themselves, or shall be claimed. Article 14. The high contracting parties shall not demand the surrender of refugees and deserters who may have passed under their respective dominations before or during the war. With a view, however, to prevent mutually the prejudicial consequences which might result from the communi cation which some of these refugees may maintain with their old com patriots, the Persian Government engages not to tolerate within its possessions situated between the A raxes and the line formed by the river called Tehan, the Lake of Aroomiah, the River of Djikaton, and by the river named Hizri Ozane, as far as its confluence with the Caspian Sea, the presence of the individuals who shall be designated by name 110 % or who may be so indicated herealter.

As far as concerns the mass of the population in the two countries, it is agreed between the high contracting parties that their respective subjects who might have already passed, or who may hereafter pass, from one State into the other, shall be free to settle or sojourn wherever the Government under whose authority they may place themselves shall deem proper.

The two high contracting parties, desirous that their respective sub jects shall enjoy all the advantages resulting from freedom of commerce on both sides, have agreed upon the following articles. Russian sub jects provided with passports in due form shall be allowed to trade through out the whole extent of the Kingdom of Persia, and also to proceed to the States adjoining the said Kingdom. In return for which Persian subjects shall be allowed to import their mer chandize into Russia either by the Caspian Sea or by the frontier land separating Russia from Persia, to barter them or to make purchases or exportation ; and they shall enjoy all the rights and privileges accorded in the States of His Imperial Majesty to the subjects of the most favoured friendly powers. In the event of the death of a Russian subject in Persia, his movable and immovable property, as belonging to a subject of a friendly power, shall be entirely made over to his relations or partners who shall have the right to dispose of the said property as they may think fit. In default of relations or partners the disposal of these same goods shall be entrusted to the Mission, or to the Consuls of Russia without any oppo sition on the part of the local author ities. Article 2. Contracts, bills of exchange, secur ities and other engagements passed Les deux hautes parties contractantes desirant faire jouir leurs sujets respectifs de tous les avantages qui resultent d’une liberte reciproque de commerce, sent convenus de ce qui suit. Les sujets Russes, munis de passeports en bonne forme, pourront commercer dans toute Tetendue du Royaume de Perse et se rendre egalement dans les Etats voisine du dit Royaume. En reciprocite de quoi, les sujets Persans pourront importer leurs marchandises en Russie, soit par la Mer Caspienne, soit par la frontiere de terre qui separela Russie de la Perse, les echanger ou faire des achats pour Pexportation, et ils jouiront de tous les droits et prerogatives accordes dans les Etats de Sa Majeste Imperiale aux sujets des Puissances amies les plus favorisees. En cas de deces d’un sujet Russe en Perse, ses biens meubles et immeubles, comme appartenant a un sujet d’une Puissance amie, seront remis integralement a ses parents ou associes, lesquels auront le droit d’aliener les dits biens selon qu’ils le jugeront convenable. A defaut de parents, ou d’associes, la dis position de ces memes biens sera confiee a la Mission, ou aux Consuls de Russie, sans aucune entrave de la part des auto rites locales. Article 2.

If one of the two parties, with out being provided with documents drawn up and legalized as mentioned above, which shall be valid before either Court of justice, should wish to institute an action against the other by simply producing witnesses, such claims shall not be admitted unless the defendant himself should ack nowledge their validity. Every en gagement contracted between the res pective subjects [of the two powers] in the forms above prescribed shall be scrupulously observed, and every refusal to abide by it that might occasion loss to one of the parties, shall be visited with a proportionate indemnity from the other party. In case of the failure of a Russian mer chant in Persia, his creditors shall be paid out of the goods and effects of the insolvent; but the Minister, the Charge d’Affaires, or the Consul of Russia shall not refuse their good offices, if need be, to ascertain if the insolvent has not left in Russia disposable property which might serve to satisfy the said creditors.

Si Tune des deux parties, sans etre pourvue des documents dresses et legalises comme il est dit plus haut, lesquels seront valables par devant chaque cour de justice, voulait intenter un proems a 1’autre en ne produisant que des preuves testimoniales, de telles pre tentions ne seront point admises, a moins que le defendeur iui-meme n’en recon- naisse la legalite.

If Russia should deem it neces sary to make new customs regula tions and new tariffs, she neverthe less engages even in that case not to increase the duty of five per cent, mentioned above. Article 4 . If Russia or Persia should be in volved in war with another Power, the respective subjects shall not be prohibited from passing with their merchandize through the territories of the high contracting parties in order to proceed to the states of the said Power. Article 5. Seeing that, according to the exist ing usages in Persia, it is difficult for foreign subjects to find houses, ware- rooms or proper places for the storage of their merchandize to let, it is per mitted to Russian subjects in Persia Article 3. Afin d’assurer au commerce des sujets respectifs les avantages qui font 1’objet des stipulations anterieures, il est con- venu, que les marchandises importees en Perse ou exportees de ce Royaume par les sujets Russes, et pareillement les productions de la Perse importees en Russie par les sujets Persans, soit par la Mer Caspienne, soit par la frontiere de terre entre les deux Etats, de meme que les marchandises Russes que des sujets Persans exporteraient de PEmpire, par les memes voies, seront soumises, comme par le passe, a un droit de cinq pour cent pergu une fois pour toutes a leur entree ou a leur sortie, et ne seront assujetties ensuite au payement d’aucun autre droit de douane.

If a Russian subject should happen to be implicated with individuals of another nation in a criminal suit, he shall not be prosecuted nor molested in any way without proofs of his participation in the crime ; and even in that case, as in the one in which a Russian subject should be charged with direct culpability, the tribunals of the country shall not be competent to proceed with the trial and judg ment of the crime except in the pre sence of a delegate of the Mission or the Russian Consulate, and if there should be none on the spot in which the crime has been committed, the local authorities shall take steps to send the delinquent to a place where there is a Consul or a constituted Russian Agent.

The importation of salt and tobacco in any shape or form whatsoever, the products of Persia, into Turkey is prohibited, and this prohibition shall continue so long as similar prohibitions remain in force with other nations. The Persian Government has also the right to prohibit the importation of Turkish salt and tobacco into Persia. Article 2. The duty on Persian tumbaku imported into Turkey, by land or sea, shall be 75 per cent, of its net value. This duty once levied no further dues of any kind shall be leviable in Turkey. Article 3. The 75 per cent, shall be leviable in accordance with a tariff to be agreed upon by the two parties. From the beginning of the month of Naisan in the year 1291 of the Turkish era to a period of three months, the amount of the customs dues on tumbaku levied at the Customs Houses of Erzerum, Bagdad, and Jeddah, together with the minimum amount of tumbaku brought to the aforesaid places in the above- mentioned period shall be calculated, and the mean average of the result of that calculation shall be adopted as the basis of the first tariff of the convention. Tumbaku which shall not have reached during the aforesaid period shall be valued in accordance with the lowest price of its kind during a period of a year prior to the above-mentioned three months. The tariff shall remain in force for a period of ten years from its establishment. Shoi*ld one of the Contracting parties request a change or alterations therein during a period of three months prior to the ex piration of the agreed period it shall be renewed.

On the determination of its net weight should it be sold in the place the 75 per cent, must be immediately paid and a paper (tezkereh) for it taken, but should it be proposed to take it elsewhere for sale the owner must proceed to the Customs and present a merchant of credit as a guarantee and execute a bond, binding himself to transport the tumbaku to the place he intends selling it in within a reasonable determined period, and after having his tezkereh countersigned by the local Customs authority he shall return it to the place of entry, where he shall pay the 75 per cent. After presenting a guarantee and executing the bond a paper will be handed over to the merchant setting forth the weight of his goods and the date within wdiich it shall be delivered to the Customs House of the town to which it is being sent. Should the merchant desire to pay the dues after sale, he may do so if he places the tumbaku in his stores in a room locked with two keys, one of which is to be m the hands of the Customs officials. This also may be done at the merchant’s option at the frontier (or first Customs House at which it is delivered).

My Loud, “ I have the honour to transmit herewith, for your Lordship’s information, translation of the Akhal-Khorassan Boundary Treaty, lately concluded between Russia and Persia, as reported in my telegram of the 4th January. “ This translation has been made from the Russian text by Mr. Stephen. Comparing it with the Persian version 1 observe that the terms employed in Article V are not the same in both languages. In the Russian text it is stated that both Governments etigage, with a view to the development of commercial intercourse between the Trans-Caspian province and Khorassan, to come to a mutually advantageous agreement for the construction of waggon-roads between the above-mentioned provinces ; whereas in the Persian version of this clause it is said that, in order to facilitate commercial operations between the Trans-Caspian provinces and that of Khorassan, the two Contracting Powers engage, as regards the construction of waggon-roads for the transport of merchandise between the aforesaid countries, to make such arrangements as may be of mutual advantage to them. 14 The Minister for Poreign Affairs has informed me that the Nasseer-ed-Dowleh, who was brmerlv employed in the Persian Foreign Office, and lately in the Ministry of Justice, will be named Commissioner under Article If of this Convention for the local demarcation of the line of frontier, on the basis agreed upon in Article 1. Eni Granville ,| xx ii PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. XIX—1881. Who, having exchanged their respective full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed on the following Articles :— Article 1. Frontier between Russia and Persia East of the Caspian Sea. The frontier-line between the Possessions of the Russian Empire and Persia&gt; east of the Caspian Sea, is fixed as follows :— Beginning at the Hasan Kuli Gulf the course of the River Atrek serves as the frontier as far as Chat. From Chat the frontier-line follows in a north-easterly direction the ridges of the Songou Dagh and Sagirim ranges, thence extending north ward to the Chandir River, reaching the bed of that river at Tchakan Kale. From Tchakan Kale it runs in a northerly direction to the ridge of the mountains dividing the Chandir and Sumbar valleys, and extends along the ridge of these mountains in an easterly direction, descending to the bed of the Sumbar at the spot where the Ach-Agaian stream falls into it. From this point eastward the bed of the Sumbar marks the frontier as far as the ruins of Medjet Daine. Thence the road to Durrun forms the frontier line as far as the ridge of the Kopet Dagh, along the ridge of which the frontier extends south-eastward, but before reaching the upper part of the Giamab Pass turns to the south along the mountain heights dividing the valley of the Sumbar from the source of the Giamab. Thence taking a south-easterly direction across the summits of the Misino and Tchoubest Mountains, it reaches the road from Giamab to Rabab, passing at a distance of 1 verst to the north of the latter spot. From this point the frontier-line runs along the ridge of the mountains as far as the summit of the Dalang Mountain, whence passing on the northern side of the village of Khairabad it extends in a north-easterly direction as far as the boundaries of Geok Keital. From the boundaries of Geok Keital the frontier-line crosses to the gorge of the River Firuze, intersecting that gorge on the northern side of the village of Firuze Thence the frontier-line takes a south-easterly direc tion to the summits of the mountain-range bounding on the south the valley, through which the road from Askabad to Firuze passes, and runs along the crest of these mountains to the most easterly point of the range. From here the frontier-line crosses over to the northernmost summit of the Aselm range, passing along its ridge in a south-easterly direction, and then skirting round to the north of the village of Keltechinar it runs to the point where the Ziri Kou and Kizil Dagh Mountains join, extending thence south-eastward along the summits of the Ziri Kou range, until it issues into the valley of the Baba Durmaz stream. It then takes a northerly direction, and reaches the oasis at the road from Gavars to Lutfa- bad, leaving the fortress of Baba Durmaz to the east. Article 2. Commissioners to be appointed to trace the Boundary in detail. Whereas, in Article 1 of the present Convention, the principal points are indi cated through which the frontier between the possessions of Russia and Persia is to pass, the High Contracting Parties are to appoint Special Commissioners with a■■■ . / PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. XIX—1881. view of accurately tracing oji the spot the frontier-line and of erecting proper boundary-marks. The date and place of meeting of the said Commissioners shall be mutually agreed upon by the High Contracting Parties. Article 3. Persia to evacuate Forts of Giamab and Kulkulab, reserving right to withdraw Inhabi tants within Persian Terriionj. Whereas the forts of Giamab and Kulkulab, situated in the gorge through which the stream watering the soil of the Trans-Caspian province passes, lie to the north of the line which, in virtue of Article 1 of the present Convention, is to serve as the boundary between the territories of the two High Contracting Parties, the Govern ment of His Majesty the Shah engage to evacuate the said forts within the space of one year from the date of the exchange of the ratifications of the present Convention, but shall have the right during the said period to remove the inhabitants of Giamab and Kulkulab to within the Persian frontier, and to establish them there. Russia not to erect Fortifications or to establish Turcoman Families within these localities. On their part the Government of the Emperor of All the Kussias engage not to erect fortifications in these said localities nor to establish any Turcoman families therein. Article 4. Persia not to interfere with Water Supply flowing to Akhal through Persian Territory nor to increase number of Villages or extent of land noiv under cultivation along sources of River Firuze and other Streams. Whereas the sources of the River Firuze, as well as of other streams watering the soil of the Trans-Caspian province contiguous to the Persian frontier, lie within the Persian territory, the Government of His Majesty the Shah engage on no account whatever to permit the establishment of fresh settlements along the course of the said streams and rivulets from their sources to the point where they leave Persian territory, and not to extend the area of land at present under cultivation, and under no pretence whatever to turn off the water in larger quantities than is necessary for irrigating the fields now under cultivation within the Persian territory. With a view to the immediate observance and fulfilment of this stipulation the Govern ment of His Majesty the Shah engage to appoint a sufficient number of competent Agents, and to subject any infringer thereof to severe punishment. Article 5.* Commercial Intercourse betiveen Akhal and Khorassan. Construction of Roads. With a view to the development of commercial intercourse between the Trans- Caspian province and Khorassan, both High Contracting Parties engage to come *See note, p. IxxiIxxiy PERSIA—APPENDIX NO.

There is no visible sign of her recent sovereignty, and on each occasion that she On the other hand the valley passed into Afghan possession in 1749-50, and possibly may have remained populated and flourishing under Herat until about 100 years ago, or for a period of nearly 40 years. been, for administrative purposes, attached to Kushan, the connecting link being naturally Darband and Kafir Kalla, all three being dependent on the same water- supply. In the same way Chahar Kalla may have become attached to Ghorian. This would not, however, explain how Chahar Kalla came to be attached to have been attached to Ghorian in 1686, when the whole Herat province w 7 as under Persia, while the Persian sanad, No. 10, refers to it as attached to Bakharz in 1792, when it was under Afghanistan. The genuineness of the sanads, as already stated, cannot be thoroughly tested until the opposing parties have had an opportunity of examining them. If Kilich Khan was a Herat subject np to the time of his death in 1822J. then it would appear that the Afghans re-asserted their claims to Hashtadan between date of Mirza Hadi’s incumbency of the office of Treasurer or revenue Collector ol Herat is ascertained. After Kilich Khan’s death there seems little doubt that the of the Turkomans. This state of things continued until 1874, when Persia re presented by Yusuf Khan, Hazara, commenced work at Hashtadan, but was promptly stopped by the Afghans. So it is not surprising that the Afghans cite the withdrawal of Yusuf as a tacit recognition of their own rights. C.M. individuals, and my own observation, I consider that Persia has neither regained nor occupied Hashtadan since she lost it in 1749-50 has attempted occupation she has at once been rebuffed by the Afghans. During this time it is possible that Hashtadan and Kulukh Pardai may have t As alleged by the Persians. Ghorian in 1684 while underf Persian sway. A similar difficulty arises about Tir Kisht, which the Afghan sanad shows to 1806-10, although it is doubtful whether the idea of restoring the valley to prosperity was ever carried out. A clue to this will be perhaps found when the valley was again abandoned by the Afghans and remained practically at the disposalIxxx PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. XXII—1888. The Persian claim was not again put forward until 1885, when it was again disputed by the Afghans. Whether the assertions and statements of the Afghan Agent regarding the regulations adopted for patrols, escorts, and liability for payment of compensation are accurate cannot obviously be ascertained until the Persians have had an oppor tunity of making a reply. Both sides will probably summon crowds of witnesses to support their state ments and the result will not be satisfactory or convincing. Since the alleged attempt of Kilich Khan at occupation up to 1874 the claims of the Afghans seem to have lain dormant, but even then no attempt was made by them to occupy the place themselves. Upon the whole, looking to the nature of my present information, it seems to me that neither Persians nor Afghans can produce proofs of recent possession in support of their respective claims, neither halving felt inclined to stand the brunt of collisions, in such an exposed locality, with the Turkomans. The case seems eminently one for compromise, in which both parties should somewhat abate their pretensions in order to render an equitable settlement possible. Such a settlement is possible only by a division of the water-supply available for irrigation as indicated by the old karezes* or kanats (old water canals). It * Under-ground canals. is on this principle that the compromise indicated ment of India. 011 ina P t °f the Hashtadan valley has been C.M. based. By accepting the above compromise Persia will secure the greater portion of the ara j e and of the valley including the actual land over which the dispute arose an on which work was interrupted by the Afghans, as already described. On the other hand the Afghans will secure what they profess to desire, viz.&gt; a supp y of water for the irrigation of the Kafir Kalla landsj and all the grazing- i fhe Afghans will also have a g roun ds lying on the southern end of the valley. Neither Persians nor Afghans are aware of the nature of the compromise I have in view, but it is remarkable that Nawab Hassan Ali Khan, who is in no way a favourer of Afghanistan, pro posed a compromise very similar to mine, of the nature of which, of course, he is completely considerable area of arable land at Chahar Kalla, as well as the large tract near the mouth of the Shora b pass which can be irrigated from the large canal, and the culti vation at lir Kxsht can be extend ed to a considerable extent.

APPENDIX No. XXV.—[See page 20.] Treaty of Friendship between Persia and tbe Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, signed at Moscow, February 26, 1921. The Persian Government of the one part, and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic of the other part, desiring to establish relations of friendship and fraternity between the two nations, have decided to engage in negotiations for this purpose, and have therefore appointed the following Plenipotentiaries :— For Persia : Ali Gholi Khan Mochaverol-Memalek, and for Russia : 0. V. Tchitcherin : who after the verification of their respective powers, have agreed as follows:— Article 1. In order to confirm its declarations regarding Russian policy towards the Persian nation, which formed the subject of correspondence on January 14, 1918 and June 26, 1919, the R. S. F. S. R. formally affirms once again that it definitely renounces the tyrannical policy carried out by the Colonizing Governments of Russia which have been overthrown by the will of the workers and peasants of Russia. Inspired by this principle, and desiring that the Persian people should be happy and independent and should be able to dispose freely of its patrimony, the Russian Republic declares the whole body of treaties and conventions concluded with Persia by the Tsarist Government, which crushed the rights of the Persian people, to be null and void. Article 2. The R. S. F. S. R. expresses its reprobation of the policy of the Tsarist Govern ments of Russia, which, on the pretext of ensuring the independence of the peoples of Asia, concluded, without the consent of the latter, treaties with European Powers, the sole object of which was to subjugate those peoples. This criminal policy, which infringed upon the independence of the countries ot Asia and which made the living nations of the East a prey to the cupidity and the tyranny of European robbers, is abandoned unconditionally by Federal Russia. Federal Russia, therefore, in accordance with the principles laid down in Articles a and 4 of the Treaty, declares its refusal to participate in any action which might destroy or weaken Persian sovereignty. It regards as null and void the whole body of treaties and conventions concluded by the former Russian Government with third parties in respect of Persia or to the detriment of that country. Article 3.PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. XXV—1921. Ixxxvii At the same time, in view of the repugnanceVhich the Russian Federal Govern ment feels to enjoying the fruit of the policy of usurpation of the Tsarist Government, it renounces all claim to the Achouradeh Islands and to the other islands on the Astrabad Littoral, and restores to Persia the village of Firouzeh and the adjacent land ceded to' Russia in virtue of the Convention of May 28, 1893. The Persian Government agrees for its part that the Russian Sarakhs, or “ old ” Sarakhs, and the land adjacent to the Sarakhs River, shall be retained by Russia. The two High Contracting Parties shall have equal rights of usage over the Atrak River and the other frontier rivers and waterways. In order finally to solve the question of the waterways and all disputes concerning frontiers or terri tories, a Commission, composed of Russian and Persian representatives, shall be appointed. Article 4. In consideration of the fact that each nation has the right to determine freely its political destiny, each of the two Contracting Parties formally expresses its desire to abstain from any intervention in the internal affairs of the other. Article 5. The two High Contracting Parties undertake (1) To prohibit the formation or presence within their respective territories of any organizations or groups of persons, irrespective of the name by which they are known, whose object is to engage in acts of hostility against Persia or Russia, or against the Allies of Russia. They will likewise prohibit the formation of armed troops within their respective tersitories with the aforementioned object. (2) Not to allow a third Party or any organization, whatever it be called, which i» hostile to the other Contracting Party, to import or to convey in transit across their countries material which can be used against the other Party. (3) To prevent by all means in their power the presence within their territories or within the territories of their Allies of all armies or forces of a third Party in cases in which the presence of such forces would be regarded as a menace to the frontiers, interests or safety of the other Contracting Party. Article 6 . If a third Party should attempt to carry out a policy of usurpation by means of armed intervention in Persia, or if such Power should desire to use Persian territory as a base of operations against Russia, or if a Foreign Power should threaten the frontiers of Federal Russia or those of its Allies, and if the Persian Government should not be able to put a stop to such menace after having been once called upon to do so by Russia, Russia shall have the right to advance her troops into the Persian interior for the purpose of carrying out the military opera tions necessary for its defence. Russia undertakes, however, to withdraw her troops from Persian territory as soon as the danger has been removed.Ixxxviii PERSIA- APPENDIX NO. XXV— 1921. Akticle 7. The considerations set forth in Article 6 have equal weight in the matter of the security of the Caspian Sea. The two High Contracting Parties therefore have agreed that Federal Russia shall have the right to require the Persian Government to send away foreign subjects, in the event of their taking advantage of their engage ment in the Persian navy to undertake hostile action against Russia. Article 8. Federal Russia finally renounces the economic policy pursued in the East by the Tsarist Government, which consisted in lending money to the Persian Goveir- ment, not with a view to the economic development of the country, but rather for purposes of political subjugation. Federal Russia accordingly renounces its rights in respect of the loans granted to Persia by the Tsarist Governments. It regards the debts due to it as void, and will not require their repayment. Russia likewise renounces its claims to the resources of Persia which were specified as security for the loans in question. Article 9. In view of the declaration by which it has repudiated the colonial and capitalist policy which occasioned so many misfortunes and was the cause of so much blood shed, Federal Russia abandons the continuation of the economic undertakings of the Tsarist Government the object of which was the economic subjugation of Persia. Federal Russia therefore cedes to the Persian Government the full owner ship of all funds and of all real and other property, which the Russian Discount Bank possesses on Persian territory, and likewise transfers to it all the assets and liabilities of that Bank. The Persian Government nevertheless agrees that in the towns where it has been decided that the Russian Socialist Republic may establish Consulates, and where buildings exist belonging to the Discount Bank, one of these buildings, to be chosen by the Russian Government, shall be placed at the disposal of the Russian Consulate, free of charge. Article 10. The Russian Federal Government, having abandoned the colonial policy, which consisted in the construction of roads and telegraph lines more in order to obtain military influence in other countries than for the purpose of developing their civilizations, and being desirous of providing the Persian people with those means of communication indispensable for the independence and development of any nation, and also in order to compensate the Persian people as far as possible for the losses incurred by the sojourn in its territory of the Tsarist armies, cedes free of charge to the Persian Government the following Russian installations :— (a) The high-roads from Enzeli to Tehran, and from Kazvin to Hamadan, and all land and insti rations in connection with these roads.PERSIA—APPENDIX NO.

(d) All telegraph and telephone lines established in Persia by the Tsarist Government, with all movable and immovable installations and dependencies. (e) The port of Enzeli and the warehouses, with the electrical installation and other buildings. Article 11 . ln ^ ^ tHat the Treat y of Turkomantchai, concluded on February 10 , 1828 (old style), between Persia and Russia, which forbids Persia, under the terms of Article 8, to have vessels in the waters of the Caspian Sea, is abrogated in accordance with the principles set forth in Article 1 of the present Treaty the two High Contracting Parties shall enjoy equal rights of free navigation on ’that Sea, under their own flags, as from the date of the signing of the present Treaty Article 12 . . The Eussian Federal Government, having officially renounced all economic mterests obtained by military preponderance, further declares that, apart from the concessions which form the subject of Articles 9 and 10, the other concessions obtained by force by the Tsarist Government and its subjects shall also be regarded as null and void. In conformity with which the Russian Federal Government restores, as from the date of the signing of the present Treaty, to the Persian Government, as re presenting the Persian people, all the concessions in question, whether already being worked or not, together with all land taken over in virtue of those concessions. Of the lands and properties situated in Persia and belonging to the former Tsarist Government, only the premises of the Russian Legation at Tehran and Zergundeh with all movable and immovable appurtenances, as well as all real and other property of the Consulates and Vice-Consulates, shall be retained by Russia. Russia abandons, however, her right to administer the village of Zergundeh, which was assigned by the ex-Government of the Tsar. Article 13. The Persian Government, for its part, promises not to cede to a third Power or to its subjects, the concessions and property restored to Persia by virtue of the present Treaty, and to maintain those rights for the Persian nation. Article 14. The Persian Government, recognizing the importance of the Caspian fisheries for the food supply of Russia, promises to conclude with the Food Service of thexc PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. XXV—1921. Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic immediately upon the expiry of the legal period of these existing engagements, a contract relating to the fisheries, containing appropriate clauses. Furthermore, the Persian Government promises to examine, in agreement with the Government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, the means of at once conveying the produce of the fisheries to the Food Service of Soviet Russia pending the conclusion of the above contract. Article 15. In accordance with the principle of liberty of conscience proclaimed by Soviet Russia, and with a desire to put an end, in Moslem countries, to religious pro paganda, the real object of which was to exercise political influence over the masses and thus to satisfy the rapacity of the Tsarist Government, the Government of Soviet Russia declares that the religious settlements established in Persia by the former Tsarist Government are abolished. Soviet Russia will take steps to pre vent such missions from being sent to Persia in the future. Soviet Russia cedes unconditionally to the nation represented by the Persian Government the lands, property and buildings belonging to the orthodox Mission situated at Urmiah together with the other similar establishments. The Persian Government shall use these properties for the construction of schools and other institutions intended for educational purposes. Article 16. By virtue of the communication from Soviet Russia, dated June 25, 1919, with reference to the abolition of consular jurisdictions, it is decided that Russian subjects in Persia and Persian subjects in Russia shall, as from the date of the present Treaty, be placed upon the same footing as the inhabitants of the towns in which they reside ; they shall be subject to the laws of their country of residence, and shall submit their complaints to the local courts. Article 17. Persian subjects in Russia and Russian subjects in Persia shall be exempt from military service and from all military taxation. Article 18. Persian subjects in Russia and Russian subjects in Persia shall, as regards travel within the respective countries, enjoy the rights granted to the most favoured nations other than countries allied to them.

Monsieur le Ministre Plenipotentiaire, In view of the fact that the Persian nation is in doubt with regard to the futuie of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, I have the honour, in the name of the Government of the Soviet Republic of Russia, to inform you as follows :— In full conformity with the principles of international policy laid down by the second Session of the All Russian Soviets on the 26th October 1917, the Council of the People’s Commissaries hereby declares that the Anglo-Russian Convention, 1907, in view of its inconsistency with the freedom and independence of the Persian nation, is completely and perpetually annulled. The Council of the People’s Commissaries further declares that all conventions concluded prior or subsequently to the aforesaid Convention and which limit or diminish, in any respect whatsoever, the rights of the Persian people in relation to a free and independent existence are null and void. And, with regard to those Russian troops which have not yet returned and are, thereby, a source of trouble to the Persian people, I beg to assure you, Monsieur le Ministre Plenipotentiaire, that this state of affairs is contrary to our intention and is due to the ignoranee of a section of the soldiery and the mischievous intentions of the anti-revolutionary elements amongst their officers. The Soviet Government, of its part, will take necessary measures to liberate Persia from the hands of the former Tsarist functionaries and Imperialist Bourgeois, who are equally the enemies of the 1 d 2'mmammmmmarnmm XCiv PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. XXY—1921. Persian and Russian Nations. All Russian subjects who may have been guilty of unlawful actions and violent behaviour towards the Persian population, shall be visited with the full rigours of the Revolutionary Laws. The Soviet Government will, further, make all possible efforts, on its part, for securing the complete evacuation of Persia, by the armies of Turkey and England. I confidently hope that the time is approaching when the nations will compel their Governments to put an end to the miseries suffered by the Persian people, and that the latter itself will (then) be enabled to freely develop its forces within the limits of its own territories. However it may be, the Council of the People’s Commissaries considers itself as entitled to such relations only with the Persian people as are based on (mutual) consent and respect among nations.

Whereas, North Persia has been laid waste by the armies of the former Russian Governments, as well as by the operating military columns of the Turks and English, and the responsibility of this devastation is entirely attributable to the Capitalist Governments of England, Turkey and Tsarist Russia, Soviet Russia, which bears towards Persia, oppressed by the Allied Imperialist Governments, feelings of good will, is desirous of indemnifying Persia, in an equitable manner, for the losses incurred by her owing to the Russian parties, and trusts that, relying on the supportPERSIA—APPENDIX NO. XXV—1921. xcv of tlie Persian people, the Persian Government will find means of claiming, also, from the English Imperialist Government compensation for the losses caused by it in Persia. The Soviet Government, in view of its desire to indemnify the Persian people for the losses incurred by it, declares that:— (1) All Persian loans owed to the Tsarist Government are null and void. (2) Russia perpetually abstains from interference of every kind with the revenues of Persia, e.g., the receipts from Customs, Telegraphs, Posts, Land Revenue, etc. (3) The Caspian Sea, after it has been cleared of the ships of the Imperialist free-booters, the English, will be declared free for navigation by the vessels flying the flag of a free Persia. (4) The frontiers of Soviet Russia along Persia will be fixed according to the free will of the inhabitants of those frontiers. (5) All concessions of the Russian Government and those of its subjects are null and void. (6) The (Russian) Discount Bank of Persia, with all attached grounds, as well as its branches in the country, are declared to be the property of the free Persian people. (7) The following are restored for enjoyment, and as the property, of the free and independent Persian people : The line of telegraphs between Meshed and Sistan as well as the telegraph lines, Nahia-Astrabad ; the Chaussee road, Enzeli-Tehran, as well as the other Chaussee roads and buildings connected therewith, constructed by the Russian troops in the course of their sojourn in Persia at the time of the war of 1914-1918 ; the port of Enzeli, with all its organisations, e.g., electric light, workshop, installations, posts, and other instruments, etc. ; the Julfa-Tabriz railway and the branch line to Sufiyan, together with all property, and buildings connected therewith and the like ; similarly all Russian Offices of Post, Telegraphs and Telephones in Persia. The payment of the claims of the employees and workmen of the aforesaid establishments falls on the Persian people. (8) The jurisdiction of the former Consuls is completely abolished. (9) The Orthodox Mission of Urmiah is dissolved. (10) All Russian subjects, resident in Persia, are liable, equally with the local residents to the payment of all taxes and revenues, provided that these taxes and revenues are according to law and have been instituted for meeting the requirements of the nation. (11) The Russian Government is ready, conjointly with the Persian Govern ment, to discuss the question relating to the proprietary rights in land of the Russian subjects in Persia, the method of farming and payment of revenues and the like, and to settle it with due regard to the interests of the two peoples.XCV1 PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. XXV—1921. (12) The Russo-Persian frontier is opened for free travel and transport ot goods. Persia is allowed the transit of goods through Russia, with a view to transport from whatever place of whatever things desired. (13) The Government of Soviet Russia is ready, in co-operation with the Persian Government, to organise the arrangements for the transport of goods in Persia with the help of Russian resources for transport ation, e.g., railways, boats and the like. (14) Russia refrains from participating in any way in the organisation of military forces in Persian territory. (15) Russia agrees to the cessation of business agencies. (16) Persia is granted the right of appointing its Consuls in all the towns and points of Soviet Russia, and similarly in Turkistan and Transcaspia and in the Allied States of Bokhara and Khiva. The People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to the Government of Soviet Russia officially communicates the facts specified above, and fully hopes that this step, on the part of Soviet Russia, has opened a new era in the history of the Russo- Persian relations. And the Revolutionary people of Russia sends its fraternal greetings to Persia, and sincerely wishes that the Persian nation will manage to throw away from its feeble shoulders the burden of the oppression and tyranny of the English and other Allied Colonial Governments whose object is completely to strangle helpless Persia. The Russian people believes that the Persian nation, counting thirty crores* souls, cannot die ; and that such a nation, whose past is so great and creditable and the annals of whose civilization contain names of men before whom the whole civilized world justly bows its head in reverence, will, with one powerful effort, wake up from its centuries-old slumber and, brushing aside the tyranny of the mean robbers, enter the Comity of free civilized nations with a view to render new res plendent services for the happiness of mankind. Tchitcherin, People's Commissary for Foreign Affairs to the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic. Annex III. Tehran, December 12, 1921. Sir, The Persian Government and the Mejliss have observed that Articles 5 and 6 of the Treaty concluded between our two countries are worded vaguely ; the Mejliss, moreover, desires that the retrocession of Russian concessions to the Persian Government should be made without reserve or condition, and, that Article 20 * Orore in Persian= 500,000.PERSIA—APPENDIX NO. XXV—1921. XCVll should be so worded as to allow the Persian Government full powers for the transit of imports and exports. Conversations have taken place with you on these questions, and you have given explanations with regard to Articles 5 and 6 and promises concerning Articles 13 and 20, to the effect that if the Treaty were passed by the Mejliss you would give all the assistance in your power to ensure that the two Articles in question should be revised on the lines desired by the Mejliss and the Persian Government. The Persian Government and the Mejliss are most desirous that friendly relations should be re-established between our two Governments and that the Treaty, which is based upon the most amicable sentiments, should be concluded as soon as possible. I have, therefore, the honour to request you to give in writing your explanations with regard to the interpretation of Articles 5 and 6, and to repeat the promises of support which you have already given as regards the revision of Articles 13 and 20, in order that the Persian Government may be enabled to secure the passing of the Treaty by the Mejliss. I also wish to ask you to take the necessary steps to repair the error which has been made in Article 3, in which the word “ convention ” was written instead of “ treaty”, as the only treaty which was concluded in 1881 was a frontier delimitation treaty, and this is the treaty referred to in Article 3. I have the honour to be, Sir, etc., Mooharos-Saltaneh. Annex IV. Tehran, December 12, 1921. Your Excellency, In reply to your letter dated 20th day of Ghows, I have the honour to inform you that Articles 5 and 6 are intended to apply only to cases in which preparations have been made for a considerable armed attack upon Russia or the Soviet Re publics allied to her, by the partisans of the regime which has been overthrown or by its supporters among those foreign Powers which are in a position to assist the enemies of the Workers’ and Peasants Republics and at the same time to possess themselves, by force or by underhand methods, of part of the Persian territory, thereby establishing a base of operations for any attacks made either directly or through the counter-revolutionary forces—which they might meditate against Russia or the Soviet Republics allied to her. The Articles referred to are therefore in no sense intended to apply to verbal or written attacks directed against the Soviet Government by the various Persian groups, or even by any Russian emigres in Persia, in so far as such attacks are generally tolerated as between neighbouring Powers animated by sentiments of mutual friendship.xcvm PERSIA-APPENDIX NO. XXV—1921. With regard to Articles 13 and 20, and the small error to which you draw attention in Article 3 with reference to the Convention of 1881, I am in a position to state categorically, as I have always stated, that my Government, whose attitude towards the Persian nation is entirely friendly, has never sought to place any restriction upon the progress and prosperity of Persia. I myself fully share this attitude, and would be prepared, should friendly relations be maintained between the two countries, to promote negotiations with a view to a total or partial revision of these Articles on the lines desired by the Persian Government, as far as the interests of Russia permit. In view of the preceding statements, I trust that, as you promised me in your letter, your Government and the Mejliss will ratify the Treaty in question as soon as possible. I have the honour to be, Your Excellency, etc. Rotstein, Diplomatic Representative of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic.APPENDIX No. XX\ I —{See 'page 20\ Treaty between the Exalted Governments of Afghanistan and Persia Tehran, June 22, 1921.

Siemens and Halske of Berlin and St. Petersburg, and to Messrs. Siemens Brothers of London the exclusive right to construct and manage a telegraphic line between the Kussian Frontier (Joolfa) and Tehran. This line will be the continuation of a direct line between London and Joolfa. Article 2. The grantees engage to organize the line, so that it shall be ready to be opened throughout its whole length not later than two years after the receipt of the present concession. No further delay will be allowed unless the execution of the work be hindered by circumstances beyond the control of the grantees. Article 3. The grantees engage to construct the line solidly, and to maintain it in a good state of repair during the whole term of the concession. The telegraphic wires must be made of iron of the best quality, and must have a diameter of at least six millemetres (very nearly quarter of an inch). The standards are to be of iron. The grantees are bound to submit the project of the formation of the line from Joolfa to Tehran for the sanction of the Persian Government. The line will at first be constructed with two wires, but the grantees have the right, in case of need, to increase the number. The grantees, moreover, engage to provide their stations with instruments of the best quality. The method of working management of the line must be previously communicated to the Persian Government. Article 4. The line of the grantees is solely destined for the despatch of Indo-European telegrams. The Administration of Persian Telegraphs entrusts to the grantees, to be despatched to their destination, all the telegrams which it receives for India or Europe. Messages from India or Europe for Persia are to be transmitted by the grantees to the proper station of the Persian telegraph, to be sent, by its medium to thosG tor whom they are intended. All direct intercourse with the public for the receipt or transmission of messages is prohibited to the grantees, unless the Persian Government authorizes the grantees to transmit inland messages in a foreign language, in which case they are to charge for such messages at the rate fixed in the Government tariff.VEll&amp;lA—Telegraphs —APPENDIX NO. XXXI—1868. cxlix Article 5. On the Persian territory the telegraphic line will be considered as a Government institution, and with respect to its organization and security it will enjoy the same rights as those accorded to the telegraph lines of the Persian Governmont- Article 6. The Persian Government exempts the grantees from customs duties on the importation of materials destined for the organization of the Persian branch of the line. The Persian Government must be previously informed of the quantity of the materials to be imported. The grantees are equally exempt from all inland imposts. Article 7. The grantees have the right to run their line through towns and villages as well as through private property, without paying any indemnity for the ground occupied. Article 8. The following arrangement has been made with respect to the settlement of the tariff for the Indo-European correspondence :— (а) Under the head of exceptions to the tariff generally adopted, half messages of ten words may be transmitted for half the price fixed for the unit message of twenty words. (б) For every additional five words over and above the twenty, at quarter of the price of the unit message of twenty words will be charged in addition. (c) The maximum price for the unit message of twenty words from London to the western part of India shall not exceed four pounds sterling, dating from the time when the English tariff for messages transmitted by the submarine lines of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean shall have been reduced to half the actual rate ; until then the price of a despatch of twenty words must not be higher than that fixed for the despatch of a similar message between Europe and India by the Turkish line. (d) The fixing of the tariff for communications between India and the inter mediate stations is left to the free will of the grantees, on condition that the price for the despatch of a message from an intermediate station to India shall not, in any case, exceed that which is charged for the whole line. Article 9. Until the expiration of the term of the Anglo-Persian Convention of the 23rd November 1865, the grantees renounce all right to participate in the receipts for international messages sent from Joolfa to Bunder-Bushire or vice versa. The grantees, therefore, are to receive nothing for the transmission of Indo-European messages between Joolfa and Tehran until the expiry of the term above-mentioned ; but, on the other hand, the price at present fixed by the Perso-Russian Convention be hot in any case raised during the present grant.cl PERSIA— Telegraphs -— APPENDIX NO. XXNI—1868. After the expiry of the term of the Anglo-Persian Convention above-mentioned the Tehran-Shiraz-Bunder-Bushire line is to be handed over in good condition, to the grantees, unless the Persian Government, in the meantime, should conclude a fresh agreement with the English Government concerning that line. In the first case the conditions of the present agreement will be equally applicable to the Tehran-Bunder-Bushire line, with this difference only that a telegraph wire is to be placed at the disposal of the Government each day for ten hours for the Persian correspondence. The Persian Government will have its own servants for this service regarding the details of which it will come to an understanding with the grantees. In case the Tehran-Bunder-Bushire line is handed over to the grantees the latter promise to pay the Persian Government for each Indo-European despatch of twenty words the sum of two francs. For half messages this payment will also be reduced to one-half. For messages which contain more than twenty words half a franc extra will be paid for every additional five words over and above the twenty. If, on the contrary, the Persian Government concludes with England another agreement for the said line, the grantees have the right to a third (one-third) of the charge fixed for messages between Joolfa and Bunder-Bushire, which, however, is never to exceed ten francs and a half. The Persian Government engages to transmit, on the Tehran Bunder- Bushire line, half messages of less than ten words for half the price for a message of twenty words. For their own messages concerning the administration of the line the grantees will have nothing to pay. If during the term of the agreement any special competition whatsoever or any other unforeseen circumstances should happen, which might necessitate a considerable reduction from the maximum of the general tariff, the Persian Government, after having assured itself of the in dispensable necessity of this measure, will give its assent to an agreement more favourable to the grantees. Article 10. The Persian Government will have a right to adopt measure of control with the object of ensuring the exact performance of the present agreement, but which must, nevertheless, neither hinder nor retard the transmission of messages. In like manner the Persian Government will have the right of inspecting the registers and proceedings of the grantees through a functionary specially appointed for the pur pose previously notified by the Government. Article 11. He Persian Government will have the right, whilst paying the price established by the Persian tariff, to transmit official messages by the line of the grantees. The grantees promise to place on their standards, between Joolfa and Tehran, the new Government wire, and to replace it during the whole term of the present agreement. To indemnify the grantees the Persian Government will repay to them the expenses for putting up the above-mentioned line only. The iron standards (their purchase, fixing, and replacing) will be at.the expense of the grantees.PI+RSIA— Telegraphs—APPENDIX NO. XXXI—1868. cli Article 12. The adjustment of accounts between the grantees and the Government will be made quarterly. If the payments due to the Government shall not be made within three months after the settlement of accounts, the Government will have a right to sequester the property of the grantees until the whole amount is liquidated. In order to facilitate intercourse with the Persian Government the grantees are to appoint a special Agent at Tehran. Article 13. The duration of the agreement is fixed for twenty-five years, dating from the day when the telegraphic working of the line shall have commenced. At the expiration of this time the privilege will cease, and the grantees must come to terms beforehand with the Government as to the continuance of their use of the Indo-European telegraphic line. In case they do not come to an understanding on this point, the whole organized line, by virtue of the agreement, will be handed over, in good condition and without indemnity, to the Persian Government. Article 14. If during the term of the grant the grantees have, with the consent of the Govern ment, put up new wires to increase the means of communication, and if at the expiry of the grant no arrangement has been made for its prolongation, the Government promises to pay the grantees, according to a valuation, an indemnity for these new wires. This valuation will be made by a Government Commission and an authorized Agent on the part of the grantees. Article 15. It will always be in the power of the grantees to transfer the rights accorded to them by the present grant, together with obligations assumed by them to a company, the rules of which ought to be confirmed by Government. The grantees are, nevertheless, expected to take at least a fifth part of the stock of such new com pany. Article 16. In order to facilitate settlement of accounts between the Persian Government and the grantees, the relative value of the monies is fixed by the following invariable currency :— One pound steiling=twenty-five francs= twenty-two krans. One shilling=one franc twenty-five centimes=one kran two shahis. One penny—ten oantimes—two shahis. One rouble=four francs=three krans and ten shahis.clii PERSIA— Telegraphs —APPENDIX NO. XXXII—1869.

The conclusions accepted by the Vienna Conference having altered the basis of the concession of 11th January 1868, granted to Messrs. Siemens and Halske and Siemens Brothers, by compelling the said grantees to fix a tariff which is below the minimum of 100 francs, stipulated in the 8th Article of the said con cession, the Persian Government and the grantees have agreed upon the following Articles :— The Persian Government concedes to the grantees from the 1st January 1870 to the expiration of the Treaty of 23rd November 1865* all the rights which it possesses under this Treaty in tlm receipts accruing from the international messages sent by the Tehran-Bushire line After the expiration of this Treaty the Tehran-Bushire line shall be made over Should the treaty be renewed, the Persian Government concedes to the grantees up to the 1st January 1895, the date of the expiration of the concession of 11th January 1868, all the rights which would revert to the Persian Government, and thirds of the receipts accruing from the international messages sent by the line grantees, as .-tipulated in the 9th Article of the concession of 11th January 1868. The grantees shall themselves collect the above-mentioned receipts, and shall arrange with the British Government to this effect. In return the grantees shall pay to the Persian Government during the 25 years, commencing from 1st February 1870 to the 1st January 1895, either a duty of two francs for each message of transit passing through the Joolfa-Bushire line, whichever it may prefer. They shall pay this duty or the fixed subsidy in both cases, whether the Tehran-Bushire line be made over to them, or whether it remains under its present management, the grantees only enjoying the revenues which revert to the Persian Government and to themselves. Moreover, the grantees are willing, should the Persian Government desire it, to pay all the debts which this Government has contracted up to the present time with the British Government for the purchase of telegraphic materials, as well as Article 1. to the grantees, unless the Persian Government should make at the time a new convention with the British Government concerning this line on the same financial basis. which the renewal of the Anglo-Persian Convention would still give it, over two- between Joolfa and Bushire, the remaining one-third already belonging to the with the exception of service messages, or an annual subsidy of 12,000 tomans, * No. XXVIII (page 179).PERSIA— Telegraphs —APPENDIX NO.

The amount of these debts must be stated by the Persian and British Govern ments before the 1st January 1871. From the commencement of this period the grantees shall be authorised to reimburse themselves by deducting every year the twenty-fourth part of the sum stated by the said Governments from the subsidy or the duties payable to the Persian Government. In case the settlement of accounts between the said Governments is not effected at the above-mentioned date another term, not exceeding one year, shall be fixed for such settlement. The grantees shall then have the right to reimburse them selves by retaining every year a sum equal to the twenty-third part of the sum stated. If the accounts are not adjusted even at the end of the latter period, the grantees shall be freed from this obligation. Article 2 . Moreover, the Persian Government grants to the actual possessors of the con cession of 11th January 1868 the exclusive privilege of erecting and working a telegraph line with one wire between Shiraz and Bunder Abbass. The grantees are bound to inform the Persian Government of the direction of the line before proceeding upon its construction. The grantees engage to finish the construction of this line as quickly as possible. The grantees engage to construct the line and to maintain it in good working order during the whole term of their administration. The telegraph wire shall # be made of iron of the best quality, and shall have inch. 36 ° r near1 ' a r|liaiter ° f an a diameter of at least 6 millimetres.* The standards shall be of iron ; the instruments, etc., of the best quality.

Like the already existing lines, the new line is designed to transmit international messages which shall pass the line of the grantees between London and Tehran. The line shall be considered as an institution of the Government, and shall enjoy, m regard to its organization and security, all the privileges accorded to the lines of the Persian Government. The Persian Government exempts the grantees from customs duties of the importation of materials destined for the organization and maintenance of this line and of its stations, and absolves them from the payment of all inland dues.

The duration of the concession is limited to 25 years, commencing from the date on which the working of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbass line shall have begun. After the expiration of this period the privilege shall cease, and the grantees shall have to come to an understanding with the Persian Government on the subject of their continued possession of this line. In case no arrangement on this point shall have been come to the whole line organized by virtue of this concession, together with the buildings at the stations, shall be made over to the Persian Govern ment without any indemnity. As the Shiraz-Bunder Abbass concession will expire after the 1st January 1895 the safety and rapidity of international traffic, which depend on uniformity of administration, would probably be imperilled if at that time the Government resumed the Joolfa-Tehran and Tehran-Bushire lines, while the Shiraz-Bunder Abbass Ime still continued for some time in the hands of the grantees. The Persian Government, wishing to obviate this inconvenience, and not wishing to resume the Shiraz-Bunder Abbass line before the expiration of this concession, so that it might not be compelled to indemnify the grantees for the expenses of construction which they might not have yet incurred, consents to extend the concession for the Joolfa-Tehran line and the arrangement regarding ffie Tehran-Bushire line till the expiration of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbass conces sions. In return the grantees shall pay to the Persian Government for the working of this line a sum of 1,000 tomans annually during the first-half of the 25 years, and 2,000 tomans annually during the second-half, the payment to commence from the date on which the line is opened to international correspondence. If the Joolfa-Tehran concession and the arrangement regarding the Tehran- Bushire line are extended beyond the 1st January 1895, they shall pay from this date, till the expiration of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbass concession, an annual subsidy of 15,000 tomans in lieu of the 12,000 tomans fixed by Article I of the present Agreement. If, during the term of the concession, the grantees should set up additional wires to increase the means of communication, the Persian Government engages to pay the grantees, on the surrender of the line, an indemnity for these additional wires fixed on an estimate made by a Government Commissioner and an authorized Agent on the part of the grantees. It shall at all times be lawful to the grantees to transfer the rights accorded to them by the present concession, together with the obligations assumed by them, to another Company, the rules of which ought to be sanctioned by the Govern ment. It is agreed that the number of foreign employes throughout the whole length of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbass line shall not exceed 50.PERSIA Telegraphs —APPENDIX NO. XXXII—1869. C J V Article 3.

From pillar No. 20 the line runs in a south-easterly direction to a long round-topped hill at the head of a ravine running down to the Kushk Biver, and thence along the crest of a ridge in a southerly direction to a point overlooking the valley of the Kushk known as the Ziarat-i-Khwaja Alam Dar, marked by a heap of stones and a grave. Pillar No. 21 stands on the top of this heap of stones. From there the hue runs straight down the side of the hill, and straight across the valley to pillar No. 22, on the left or western bank of the Kushk Biver, at a distance of 300 yards below its junction with the Moghor stream. i*] Pillar No. 22 stands near the edge of the bank above flood-level, and about 2,600 yards north of the Kara Tepe mound. From pillar No. 22 the boundary runs up the course of the Biver Kushk for some 9~! miles (as measured on the map in a direct line) to pillar No. 23 built on the edge of the right or eastern bank of the river, and nearly in the centre of the valley, at a distance of 900 yards from the head of the canal taking off from the river on the right bank at the northern side of Chahil Dukhtaran point below and on the opposite side of the river to the Ziarat-i-Chahil Dukhtaran. Pillar No. 23 is distant some 275 paces from the mound where the road up the right bank of the river after crossing the Chahil Dukhtaran point debouches again on to the plain. The boundary runs north-eastwards in a straight line from pillar No. 23 for some 144 miles to pillar No. 24, described hereafter. The inter mediate pillars are pillar No. 23A standing 360 paces to the north-east of pillar No. 23, on the top of the bluff forming the eastern edge of the valley, and about 175 paces from the mound on the road-side above mentioned.

Pillar No. 24 stands on the western end of a long, steep, white hill, as seen from the south on a point known as the Ziarat-i-Baba Taghi. This pillar is built on them 11 mnniwwi— clxxii AFGHANISTAN—APPENDIX NO, 1—1888, mound of stones marking tke site of this Ziarat, and to the west of some graves. From this point the boundary turns east by south, and follows the line of the watershed of the Bundi-i-Chingarak Range. Pillar No. 24A is built just to the north of the footpath running along the summit, where the boundary takes a turn to the south round the head of a steep-sided ravine or hollow running northwards, known as Kham-i-Sabz. Pillar No. 24B stands on the watershed at the south-east angle of the same hollow. Pillar No. 25 stands on the top of the Kotal above the Chashma-i-Chingarak on the eastern side of the road, and distant about 6| miles in a direct line from pillar No. 24. Pillar No. 26 stands on a high hill with a steep bluff on its northern side covered with pistachio trees, some If miles from pillar No. 25. The pillar is built on a heap of stones close to some graves known as the Ziarat-i-Chingarak. Thence the line bends slightly southwards again still along the same watershed round the head of a deep hollow with a spring in its south-eastern corner known as the Chashma- i-Gaz, and on to another high point, and thence on to pillar No. 27 on the point beyond that again, a high bluff without name and distant in a direct line from pillar No. 26 rather more than 4f miles. Pillar No. 28 stands on the eastern of two high points about 7^ miles to the north-east of No. 27, and pillar No. 29 about lOf miles further on beyond that again in the same direction. The boundary follows the watershed all the way. Pillar No. 29 immediately overlooks the Kashan valley, and stands on a shoulder of the hill on the western side of the valley, just below the southern of the two peaks on its summit, and opposite a western bend of the river. Here the boundary leaves the watershed, and runs in a straight line across the Kashan valley m a north-easterly direction for rather more than 3 miles to pillar No. 30 whicu stands on a heap of stones on a rocky point at the summit of the hills on the eastern side of the valley, and immediately to the west of, and overlooking the mouth of, a precipitous gorge known as the Palang Khwawali. Between pillars Nos. 29 and 30 two intermediate pillars were erected to mark the line of crossing in the Kashan valley. The first, No. 29A, stands on the left or western bank of the Kashan stream on a bit of high bank between the Kashan and its affluent, the Kalimal, and just above its junction with the latter, at a dis tance of about f of a mile from the domed reservoir at Tora-Shaikh, and about the same distance from pillar No. 29.

From pillar No. 68 the frontier turns in a north-easterly direction and runs in a straight line for 5^ miles to pillar No. 69 on the top of a slight rise 30 yards to the south of the road running from Kara Tepe Kalan to Dunguz Surt and thence on in the same straight line for 4i miles to pillar No. 70 built on a fairly high and solid mound among low sand hills half a mile to the east of the main road from Kara Tepe Kalan to Bosagha and exactly midway and in a straight line between the wells of east and west Kata- baji, the former of which remains to Afghanistan and the latter to Bokhara. From this point the boundary runs due north in a straight line for nearly 6f miles to pillar No. 71 which stands about midway between the wells of Alikadim and Chahi, to the north side of the road between them and close to the point where the road from Alikadim via Deb Kilah to Khamiab forks from the road to Chahi. The pillar stands on a low rise in the dry water-course that runs past Alikadim westwards towards Dunguz Surt. From here the frontier runs north by east in a straight line for 6§ miles to pillar No. 72 on a small patch of sound open ground amid sand hills, about half a mile outside the edge of the Khamiab cultivation and thence on in a straight line for half a mile to pillar No. 73, built at the mouth of the road that runs through the cultivation along the Buz Arik canal. The pillar stands at the south-west corner of the compound of Muhammad Wali Sufi’s house. From pillar No. 73 the boundary runs for 365 yards up the centre of this road to pillar No. 74 built on the east side of the road at the point where it crosses the Buz Arik canal by a wooden bridge, at the northern end of this bridge and on the western bank of the canal, which here turns off to the west into Bosagha land. From pillar No. 74 the boundary follows the course of the Buz Arik canal for 3 miles through the cultivation to pillar No. 75. The canal throughout this distance belongs entirely to Bosagha, the trees along its left or southern bank belonging to Khamiab and those on its northern bank to Bosagha. Pillar No. 75 is built on the northern bank of the Buz Arik or Yangi Arik canal at a distance of 15 yards to the east of the wooden bridge over that canal, situated about 200 yards to the north-east of Aral Bai’s house and 250 yards north-west of Kara’s house. From this point the boundary turns northwards across the canals and river flats and runs pretty well in a straight line to the bank of the river. From pillar No. 75 the line follows a low earthen bank or ridge for 182 yards to pillar No.76 on the top of the southern bank of the Mirza Beg Ibdal canal, and thence for 155 yards further, during which it crosses the Mirza Beg Ibdal the Nikcha, the Shaikh Arik, and the Saligh canals to pillar No.77 built on the northern bank of the Saligh canal 50 yards to the east of the canal crossing east of Juma Bai’s house, and at a point marked by the remains of some old canal which has been here cut through obliquely by the Shaikh Arik and Saligh canals. From here the boundary follows the line of the track running from the canal crossing above mentioned in a direction slightly to the east of north across the river flat to pillar No. 78 built on the south bank of a small creek crossed by the track, at a distance of 736 yards from pillar No. 77 and thence on in the same straight lineAFGHANISTAN—APPENDIX NO. 1—1888. clxxv to pillar No. 79 on the left bank of the Oxus just above flood-level and close to the west side of the track above mentioned.

Some old branches of this canal bend towards the cultivated lands near the Kara Tepe mound. The Afghan representative maintains that these branches■■■■■moan V . AFGHANISTAN—APPENDIX NO. HI—1893. have never been used for irrigation by the Afghans, and the lands in question are watered by the Kara Tepe Kalan canal. Hie total length of the Mill canal amounts to 2 versts and 250 sagenes or 1 mile and 1,167 yards. 2. The second canal proceeding up stream is the Kara Tepe Paiyin canal marked on the annexed map by the letter B, at present dry and disused. It formerly took off from the river 4 versts and 280 sagenes or rather more than 3 miles to the south of Boundary Pillar No. 22, and 2 versts and 130 sagenes or about 1 mile and 886 yards from the Kara Tepe mound and 440 sagenes or nearly 1,027 yards from the present head of the first canal, and ran a course of nearly 3 versts or 2 miles to the west of the Kara Tepe mound. The Afghan represen tative explained that this canal was closed last year by the Amir’s orders. 3. The third canal is the Kara Tepe Kalan canal marked on the map by letter B 1. This canal takes off from the Kushk at a distance of 4 versts and about 380 sagenes or 3 miles and 303 yards to the south of Pillar No. 22 and 2 versts and 230 sagenes or 1 mile and 1,120 yards from the Kara Tepe mound. Run ning in a northerly direction it passes a small Afghan village situated about half a verst lower down and thence flows north-west between the Kara Tepe mound and the hills on the west irrigating some cultivated land on its course. The total length of this canal amounts to nearly 4 versts or about 2| miles. The area of the lands irrigated by this canal amounts approximately to 72 deciatines or 194^ acres, of which 50 deciatines or 135 acres are at present occupied by the main crop marked on the map in yellow. The Afghan representative stated that there were 22 families of Achakzai Afghans settled at Kara Tepe who cultivate the lands irrigated by this canal. 4. The fourth canal proceeding on up stream is the Chapgul canal shewn on the annexed map by the letter C. This canal, which is dry at the present moment, takes off from the River Kushk at the foot of a scarp on the left bank at a dis tance of about 1 verst and 470 sagenes or 1 mile and 513 yards from the present head of the Kara Tepe Kalan canal marked B 1, and 4 versts and 170 sagenes or about 2 miles and 1,564 yards from the Kara Tepe mound. According to the explanations given by the Afghans water only enters this canal when the Kushk River is in flood. The Afghan representative stated that this canal ran dry a month ago. The Chapgul canal follows a direction almost due north near the foot of the hills on the left side of the valley for a distance of nearly 3 versts or 2 miles and irrigated during this spring two acres of land. On both sides of the canal are seen here and there traces of last year’s cultivation, but the Afghan representative stated that only two families of Alizais were now located near this canal, the remainder having all moved further up the river. The river bed was inspected and found to be quite dry for a distance of nearly 3 versts or 2 miles to the south of the head of the Chapgul canal. The Afghans explain that this peculiarity of the river can be seen also in several places higher up the \ alley as far as the town of Kushk and maintained that the river is largely fed by springs emanating from the marshes along its banks such as those below the head of the Bliihal Bukht^r canal and those near Kara Tepe. 1 k 2Cxc AFGHANISTAN—APPENDIX NO. Ill—1893. 5. The fifth or the Khwajah Jir canal, marked on the annexed map by the letter D, takes off from the Kushk 170 sagenes or about 397 yards to the east of an Afghan village and at a distance of about 6 versts and 100 sagenes or 4 miles and 233 yards above the head of the Chapgul canal and 1 verst and 440 sagenes or about 1 mile and 443 yards to the south of the Ziarat-i-Khwajah Jir called by the Turkomans Kuzganli, and 1 verst and 360 sagenes or 1 mile and 257 yards to the north of the Ziarat i-Chihal Dukhtar. The total length of the canal with out counting its branches amounts to nearly 5 versts or 3 miles and 600 yards. From the head for a distance of a little more than two versts the canal flows pa rallel to and not far from the bed of the river, then near the ruins of Kuzganli it leaves the bed of the river bending westwards about quarter of a verst or some 300 yards, and from there flows northwards irrigating the cultivated lands which are met with here and there, on both sides of the canal, for a distance of about 3 versts. The total area of these lands which are cultivated by Alizai Afghans amounts approximately to 70J deciatines or 190 acres, of which 624 deciatines or 168 acres are occupied by the main crop marked on the annexed map in yel low. The Afghan representative stated that there were altogether 38 Alizai families cultivating the land watered by this canal. 6 . The sixth canal marked on the annexed map by the letter E is known as the Pul-i-Khishti canal from its taking off from the river close to and below the old ruined brick bridge of that name, at a distance of 230 sagenes or about 537 yards east of the Mound of Chihal Dukhtar and two versts above the head of the Khwajah Jir canal. The head of the Pul-i-Khishti canal was found dry and the Afghan representative stated that this head as well as the Kara Tepe Paiyin canal, marked on the map by the letter B, was closed last year by the Amir’s orders. According to the explanations of Muhammad Painda Khan when the complaints of the Russian Authorities against the infractions of Article 3 of Protocol 4 of 10th—22nd July 1887 were communicated to the Amir, His Highness sent an officer from Herat to enquire whether any new canals had been opened on the left bank of the Kushk between Kara Tepe and Chihal Dukhtar, and having re ceived the report that the two canals marked on the map B and E had been opened by the Afghan cultivators three years ago, the Amir ordered them to be immedi ately closed. The cultivated lands near the Pul-i-Khishti canal are now irrigated by water brought into it by a branch from the Chihal Dukhtar canal and are shewn with the lands watered by the latter. The total length of the Pul-i-Khishti canal amounts to 5 versts or about 3| miles. 7. To the south of the Ziarat-i-Chihal Dukhtar at a distance of 3,250 yards according to the English map and 3,100 yards above the ruins of Pul-i-Khishti, the seventh canal known as the Chihal Dukhtar canal and marked on the map annexed to the present Protocol by the letter F takes off from the Kushk, and running northwards along the left side of the valley it irrigates some lands situated near an Afghan village to the south of the latitude of Chihal Dukhtar which do not concern the object of the present inspection. Further on the Chihal Dukhtar canal divides into three branches (one of which conducts its waters into the oldAFGHANISTAN—APPENDIX NO. Ill—1893. CXC1 bed of the Pul-i-Khishti canal) and irrigates on its way lands to the extent of 2| versts or about If miles to the. north of latitude of the ruins of Chihal Dukhtar marked in large letters on the map No. 2 annexed to Protocol No. 4 of 10th— 22nd July 1887. The total area of the lands irrigated by the Chihal Dukhtar canal sited to the north of the said parallel of latitude amounts to 146 deciatines or about 395 acres of which 107 deciatines or about 289f acres are occupied by the main crop marked in yellow on the annexed map. The Afghan representa tive stated that there were 75 families of Alizais settled along this canal. 8 . The total area of the standing corn and the vegetable gardens on the 19th 31st May 1893 (the day upon which the present inspection was concluded) on the left bank of the Kushk between Kara Tepe and Chihal Dukhtar watered by the above-mentioned canal, amounts approximately to 288 deciatines or 779 acres. Of this amount 219 deciatines or 592 acres are occupied by the main crop, called by the Afghans the Safedbarg and harvested about the month of June ; and the remainder, viz., 69 deciatines or 187 acres is occupied by vegetable gar dens and by the minor crop called by the Afghans the Sabazbarg and harvested during the autumn. The Afghan representative maintains that the lands occu pied by the minor crop are only watered when the irrigation of the main crop is concluded. In some places arable land has been recently ploughed up. V. Ignatiew. Charles E. Yate. Lieut.-Col. L. Artamanow. H. D. Napier, Lieut. Painda Khan. Charles E.

APPENDIX^No.tlV.- [See page 220.] Description of the Russo-Afghan frontier from Lake Victoria to the Taghdumbash. The first pillar has been erected at the eastern extremity of Lake Victoria at a spot which corresponds with a line crossing the centre of the Lake from west to east. From this pillar the frontier line takes a southern direction and, crossing the small gulf of Lake Victoria, proceeds to pillar No. 2 which is situated on the nearest spur of the Nicolas range. From this latter pillar the line ascends the crest of the above-mentioned spur which it follows to Peak Concord. After passing this peak the frontier line con tinues to follow the crest of the same spur till it reaches the main crest of the Nicolas range, forming the watershed between Lake Victoria and the Wakhan Darya, or Ab-i-Panja. From here the frontier line follows the main crest of the Nicolas range run ning eastward for nearly six miles, and then changing direction to the north east, and maintaining this general bearing for a distance of about 15 miles to Peak Lobanov-Rostovski. From this peak the line follows the main crest of the range for about miles until it reaches the top of the Benderski Pass where pillar No. 3 is erected. From pillar No. 3 the line continues to follow the crest of the range (through Peak Elgin) for about 15 miles to the top of the Jaminishur Pass, whence to the Ortabel Pass, a distance of six miles it follows the same crest. Pillar No. 4 is erected on the Ortabel Pass. Throughout the whole extent of the line from pillar No. 3 to pillar No. 4, the frontier follows the watershed between the Istik and the Aksu. From pillar No. 4 the line proceeds a little south of east to pillar No. 5, which is situated at a distance of about frds of a mile, and after continuing this course for nearly 3 miles from the latter pillar, leaves the main crest of the Nicolas range and, descending a spur, joins the bed of the Gunjabai stream. Here pillar No. 6 is erected. The line now follows the western branch of the Gunjabai stream till it joins the river Aksu, on the right bank of which pillar No. 7 is erected. From there the frontier line follows the Aksu to the spot where it receives the waters of the Mihmanyoli and here, on the left bank of the Aksu, is erected pillar No. 8. The line follows the Mihmanyoli stream for about two miles, when it leaves the bed of the stream and ascends a small knoll situated on the right bank on which pillar No. 9 is constructed. It next proceeds towards Lake Bakhmardin, and, after reaching the lake, follows for about a mile and a half the western arm of the Kachka-su stream which empties itself into the lake. On leaving this arm, and following an east-south-easterly direction, pillar No. 10 is reached at 2*6 miles, and pillar No. 11 at 1*7 miles further in the same direction.

(The blessed clauses which bind together two brother Governments of the East united in faith and interest.) In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate ! The Turkish and Afghan Governments, convinced that they are bound to gether by sincere ties of sympathy, are imbued with one desire and one sacred purpose, and each possess the same high moral and material interests, and that the happiness or misfortune of one State will redound to the happiness or mis fortune of the other, and recognising that it is no longer possible that they should remain disconnected and isolated as in the past, and that certain historical duties necessarily devolve upon them at this moment, when is seen with infinite thank fulness that an era of awakening and deliverance of the Eastern world has begun. These two brother States and nations, therefore, observing that as with the members of one body the troubles and afflictions of one of the parties must affect and pain the other, have resolved to transfer their age-long moral unity and natural alliance to the political sphere, to bring about a state of material and official alli ance, and, in the name of the future welfare of the whole East, to conclude a Treaty of Alliance as a prelude to future welfare. For this purpose Delegates have been nominated— Youssouf Kemal Bey, Commissioner (Minister) of Economic Affairs ; and Dr. Reza Nour Bey, Commissaire of Public Instruction, Members of the Government, on behalf of the Government of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey ; and His Highness General Muhammad Wali Khan, Ambassador Extraordi nary on behalf of Afghanistan ; Who, having communicated their full powers, found to be in due and proper order, have accepted the following Articles - Article I.
