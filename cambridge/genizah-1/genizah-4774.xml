                  <summary>Recto: part of a letter, c. 970 CE, from Šerira Gaʾon, to various Jewish
                     communities outside Babylonia, seeking financial support for the Academy of
                     Pumbeditha. Several years have elapsed since questions and donations were sent
                     from these communities to the yešiva, but the Gaʾon has not forgotten them as
                     they appear to have forgotten him and his school. The yešiva is in dire
                     financial straits, and this is causing an alarming drop in enrolment. Quotes
                     the sage Simeon b. Laqiš. Verso: unrelated jottings in Arabic script. </summary>

            <p>[We] thank His Holy Name for ransoming it, as it is written: ‘My lips will jubilantly
               cry out when I sing praises to you, and my soul, which you have ransomed’. And [we
               are hereby] informing [you] that though you — our brothers, the delights of our eyes,
               and the joys of our hearts and our friends in spirit — may have forgotten us, we have
               not forgotten you; for you are considered by us the very essence of our life, and how
               can a man forget the essence of his life?! And [we have not forgotten] your
               contributions, ‘of which we have heard and known, and of which our forefathers told
               us’, for you used to provide our daily bread, and how can a man forget the food that
               is his need? And [we have not forgotten] that the provision of our water is from you,
               and how can a man fail to recall the source of his life? Therefore, though many years
               have passed and many days have gone by and you have not been in contact with us,
               [whether in the form of] letters, [legal] questions, votive offerings or donations,
               as was your forefathers’ custom — may the memory of the righteous be for a blessing —
               [yet, despite all this] you are foremost in our thoughts. You are inscribed like a
               seal upon our heart; you murmur with its stirring; like a seal upon our arms you are
               engraven. And despite the fact that it is not always seen, it is the place of an
               important precept. And ‘behold on the palms’ we have engraven you, which will be
               seen. Therefore, with their movements you will appear to us from a distance like
               lightning in the darkness, like the shade of a rock in the wilderness. And indeed it
               is said: the Lord ‘is the one who knows and a witness’ in these matters. If we should
               forget you, may our strength be forgotten. And we [praise] the memory of your parents
               so often, our tongues become dry. And above our highest joy [you] will be set, as the
               messenger prophesied, saying: ‘If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand
               wither, let [my tongue] cleave to my palate if I do not remember you, if I do not set
               Jerusalem above my highest joy’. And with a great deal of contemplation we say: ‘For
               what reason have you forgotten us?’ Our elders sit desolate, our young men are
               sighing, our teachers are grieving, and we suffer bitterly because we see how the
               world continues to be laid waste. Though surely it is in accordance with the bidding
               of our Holy One, because on His covenant, which is his Law, [the world] stands. As it
               is written: ‘Thus said the Lord: “As surely as I have established my covenant with
               day and night, the laws of heaven and earth”. And [because His Torah] is found
               continually to be diminishing, so also the world that rests upon it continues to
               perish, as it is written: ‘They neither know nor understand. They walk about in
               darkness. All the foundations of the world are shaken’. And what profit is there that
               you forge a path for the world’s destruction? If you say [about us] that we are
               lacking and that our wisdom has diminished, truly it is so. Certainly our splendour
               has been tarnished, our learning is diminished and our schools are desolate. We are
               left, few from many. The school of the teachers is like a wasteland, for every
               bright-eyed lad used to be brought to the house of study, but now no one brings his
               son and we must employ strategems to bring them one by one so that the Mishnah will
               not be forgotten. Also many of the children of the talmudic scholars are leaving for
               other activities and taking their place among the salary-earners or emigrating. And
               from generation to generation we are becoming fewer, and from year to year [we are
               shrinking in number...]. What has brought about all this? The inaction of Israel, who
               withhold from them their stipend and their sustenance. For who can stand without
               sustenance?! When He gave his Torah to his people, ordering them to study it, each
               according to the sufficiency of his needs, did not manna descend every day so that
               they could not find a pretext not to follow it? As it is written: ‘Behold, I will
               rain down bread from the heavens for you, and the people will go out and gather it
               etc’. And when He brought them to their land, and ordered the priests and the Levites
               to study and to teach because He knew that not all were able to dedicate themselves
               to the study of law, he also ordered the people to attend to their needs. As it is
               written: ‘He ordered the people, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to deliver the
               portions of the priests and the Levites so that they might devote themselves to the
               Torah of the Lord’. And if the people display inaction, what will their sages do?
               Should they go hungry and thirsty? For we are left now calculating and toiling in
               order to get enough food — we and our children — and we will use the food to satisfy
               the remainder [of the sages] that are left and their children. And as it has been
               said about us: ‘For you will be like an oak whose leaf withers and like a garden that
               is without water’. For our leaves have withered and our water is exhausted, because
               when the sages of the law were compared to a cluster [of grapes], so also the
               wealthier people [...] the clusters. And because of what Rav Šimʿon b. Laqiš
               said:[...]</p>
