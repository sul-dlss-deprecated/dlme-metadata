The Secretary, Clarendon - rows, QXmLQ,FILE COPY External Affairs Department, New Delhi, The 27th August 19 45. 2^ Sir Hassan Suhrawardy approached us about getting the proofs of a work which he was commissioned to do, he tells me by the Oxford Press, entitled 'The Truth about Fuhammed'. He says the manuscript is long overdue and that an earlier version was lost in the mail by enemy action and that only one copy is now in existence and represents the work of many years. The secretary of the Clarendon Press impressing him for delivery and he is not unnaturally anxious that the MS should come to no* grief. He therefore asked if we could arrange to have it transmitted through the India Office. 2. Since Sir Hassan was formerly one of the Secretary of State’s Advisers it seems to be proper to do him this service, particularly as he would no doubt wish the proofs of his work to be available to the India Office before it was published. I told him, however, that I did not think I could burden the fast mail with manuscripts of this weight and I am therefore despatch ing by ordinary mail under cover of this letter.
