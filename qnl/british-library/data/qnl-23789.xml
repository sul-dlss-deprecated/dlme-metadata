Bahrain, August 13t h, 1938. The Officiating Political Agent Bahrain. To The Postmaster, Guj rat. Sir, 7ith reference to your letter No.Pen 2/11781 dated the 30th Nay 1938, I have the honour to inform you that the Descriptive roll of pensioner Tr ohamad Khan forwarded hy you shows him to have been paid up to the 31st March 1938 whereas the pension certificate produced by the pensioner shows payment up to the 31st March 1237. 2. The Descriptive roll and the pensioner’s certific are therefore sent herewith for correction of the entries and return. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant for Offg.Political Agent, Bahrain. /It, CL£ -lie, S' ipir’*-?*-'- 7 it has been decided by the Government of India that Bunna should ^ iiquiict “ h ' 31, liability for fully earned pensions by a payment of v certain percentage of the actual amounts paid in a year from Central Revenues of India in respect of pensions in issue on the 31st March 193- (including cost of coamutstion of such pensions) which should include J \ respect of personnel who retired on or before the 1st A 1967 even ibough their pensions were actually sanctioned after that date. It has further been decided by the Government of India that pensions in issue on the 31st March 1937 may provisionally be taken to include also pensions commencing on the 1st April 19 37. 2. In order to calculate the amount recoverable from Burma on this account, it has been decided by the Auditor General w India that the pensionary charges should be compiled separately under two heeds viz. 'Pensions of officers etc. who retired on or before 1.4.37' and 'Pensions of officers etc. who retired after 1.4.37'. To ensure the ccr.oo^ - — cation of pensionary charges th-s office, it is essential that the monthly schedules of Military ^ pension payments rendered by Treasury Officers and other Pension Psyinf j Agencies should correspond with the new heads of classification of | pensionary charges opened in the books of this office. It i e , therefore requested that all Treasury Officers, and other Pension Paying agencies should prepare covering lists and top sebechiles for all Military Pension payments made by them to the cla = &lt;=ec of- rv=n &lt; masses of pensioners referred to n the enclosed statement U A I} 0 The revp^no- n + me covering ii s t s and top schedules xn a consolidated form so as to include the pension payments rcade by the Head Treasuries and sub-treasuries.under them:-&gt; \ - 2 - 2, The covering lists for each class- of pensioners referred to in statement 'A' should be prepared in the following forms specimens of and shown in the lists. To ensure the correct preparation of the covering lists according to the headings given therein, the words 'Before or after 1,4,37' should be written at the right hand top if each individual voucher (excluding vouchers relating to the by schedules of payments on I,A,F,A,-380 together with sub-vouchers, certificates etc, required under rules. For the correct preparation of covering lists, separate muster rolls, one showing payments to pensioners retired on or before the 1.4.37 and the other showing endeavour to disburse pensions to any number of Indian Military Pen sioners falling under one category through one muster roll only, so that only one entry of the amount paid may be made in the particular money column in the covering lists against the Treasury concerned. In unavoidable circumstances, if Indian Mily. pensioners belonging to one category are paid through more than one muster roll* all such muster rolls should be collected, put together and the running total taken for the purpose of a single entry being made in the r©l Q vant column in the covering list against the Treasury concerned. In the case of V.C. ,0.B.I. ,I.0 o M. etc. annuities and Jangi Inam allowances paid along with the pensions the total amounts of each of these allowances should be excluded from the total amount of the muster roll concerned and shown in the relevant covering lists citing reference to the muster roll conr»«rned. The words 'retired on or b^-^re the 1st April 19 37 u or 'retired after the 1.4.37' as the case may be should always be written on the front page of the muster rolls together with the class of the pen sioners. The individual schedules on I.A.F.A.-380-A in respect of Indian Mily. pensioners whose payments are arranged for by the treasu ries through the branches of the Imperial Bank of India located at the respective stations should also be accompanied by the respective covering lists. In this case the amounts of the individual vouchers should be collected together on a separate sheet of paper and the total amount arrived at shown on the proper column of the respective covering lists against the treasury concerned. which are attached herewith for guidance. For classes 1(a),1(b)* 111(a) III(b),IX(a) andlX(b) Form 'B' form 'C', Form 'D' For classes II and X For classes IVa to VIII 3. The covering lists for classes I to III ,IX and X should be supported by individual vouchers which should be numbered serially xiu V w AJ . a j. Government pensioners) at the time of making payment. ^ 4. The covering lists for classes IV to VIII will be supported payments made to pensioners retired after the 1.4.37 may be prepared. In order to avoid too many entries in the covering lists, it is requested that each pension paying officer will kindly make every5 In addition to the preparation of the covering lists a top schedule in the specimen form 'S' attached will be prepared to show the total payments for the district.The amounts shown in the top list against each class of pensioners should not include any amount which has not found a place in any one of the covering lists so that the total payments shown in the Top list may always agree with tie amounts debited by the civil Accountant General concerned. ®. In this connection it is also impressed upon all pension Paying Officers that payment of pensions made to ordinary pensioners should not on any account be included in the payment schedules for war pensioners and vice versa. Similarly the payments made to pensioners who retired on or before the 1.4.37 should not be included in the payment schedules for pensioners who retired after the 1.4.37 and vice versa. These are very essential not only to ensure the correct classification but also to avoid unnecessary objections from this office. The running totals in the muster rolls should be continuous from pa&amp;e to page and the grand total struck at the end of the muster rolls. The words ordinary, war, Jangi Inam, Victoria Cross,Mily. Cross, Annuities, retired on or before the 1.4.37 and Retired after the 1,4.37 as the case may be should not be omitted to be written on the vouchers and schedules on which payments of pensions are made. 7.

Subject:- Pensions-Restoration of. It has been represented that in some cases considerable delay ensues in the restoration of pension to a soldier who has been convicted by the civil power and whose pension has been withheld by the District Commander under the provisions of paragraph 184, Pension Regulations. 2. The matter has been discussed with the C.M.A. &amp;, Pensions who has pointed out that, in many cases, the fact that the pensioner has been in jail is not known until after he is discharged therefrom, when he presents himself to draw his pension and has to explain why he has omitted to draw it for sometime, iction has then to be taken to withhold and again restore the pension which takes some considerable time. A copy of the C.M.A. Pensions letter is attached* 3. It is apparent that the delay is largely the result of the pensioners’ reluctance to declare their status to the Court. This being the case they have only themselves to blame, and it is suggested that they be informed through Soldiers’ Boards that, should they be charged in a Civil Court, they must disclose the fact that they are pensioners thus facilitating the early restoration of their pension on their release from jail.Copy of CJI.A.&amp;.P., Lahore * No. A3/6656* dated 10-2-1938 to H. Q. Northern Command&gt; Rawalpindi, Subjects- Restoration of pension to convicted pensioners. Reference - Your No. 1914/A2 dated the 11-1-1938, and in continuation of this office No. A3/6656, dated 29-1-1938. In the majority of cases the report of conviction of an Indian Military pensioner is made to this office by the pension disbursing officer (Postmaster or Treasury Officer) only when the military pensioner after having served his sentence of imprisonment appears before him to claim the arrears of his pension and that too if the pensioner in reply to the Pension Disbursing Officer’s query regarding the cause of his prolonged absence admits that he had been in jail. 2. On receipt of the report of the conviction of a pensioner in this office action is taken to collect the . information and documents required for the completion of the form (I.A.F.A.401, copy attached) for the submission of the case to the District Commander under para. 184, Pension Regulations. Action is also taken to suspend the payment of pension pending receipt of the orders of the District Commander. 3. High Courts in British India have no doubt issued orders to the subordinate courts that copies of the judgment in a case in which an Indian Military Pensioner is convicted should invariably be furnished by the trial courts to this Office, but out of a large number of cases of such convic tions only a few copies of judgments have been received in this office. This may be due to the accused pensioner not making out to the courts the fact that they are military pensioners. 4. If the report of the conviction of a military pensioner is received in this office when the event takes placer&gt; - 2 - place it would de arranged dy tiii's' office to collect all the informatioh and data that are required for filling in the various, columns of the attached form (I.l.F.A-401); only that portion of column 11 9 which requires it to de stated whether the sentence of the cour£ is undergone in full or not with dates-defining periods of imprisonment s could de filled in after the pensioner has deen released from jail. This procedure will greatly expedite the submission of the case to the District Commander for orders and it should de possible within a reasonable time of the pensioner f s release from jail to restore tne pension, il so ordered by the District Commande,.. however, •It will,/be seen that the information regarding the date of his release as also whether some period of imprisonment has been remitted is required for completion of the case. A con victed pensioner may also be acquitted by the appellate court. The cases, cannot therefore be submitted to the District Commander as soon as a pensioner is convicted but should be submitted at the earliest possible date after his release provided the report of the conviction is received in this i '* office in time. faCopy of paragraph 184 of Pension Regulations for the Army in India. ’’Future good conduct is an implied condition of every grant of a pension. The District or Independent Brigade Commander may, in consultation with the C.M.A. concerned and, if necessary, with the civil authorities also, withhold, reduce or restore, in full or part, the pension (service, disability and family pension and child’s allowance) or gratuity of an Indian military pensioner who may be convicted of a serious crime or be found guilty of grave misconduct other than of a political nature. Pension withheld under this rule unless and until restored will lapse to the state. In cases relating to misconduct of political nature, the District Commander, on the recommendation of the local Govern ment or adminstration concerned, is competent to order the forfeiture or restoration of the pension (service, disability and family pension - the last only when drawn by adult males and child's allowance). The full pension admissible under rule is not to be given as a matter of course or unless the service rendered has been really approved : if the service has not been thoroughly satisfactory, the authority sanctioning the pension may withhold the pension or ma ;e such reduction in the amount as it thinks proper. Note (a) - If a pensioner is sentenced to imprisonment for a criminal offence, or if he is kept in police or jail custody as an under-trial prisoner and is eventually sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a criminal offence his pension will forthwith be suspended provisionally. The district or independent brigade commander concerned will decide whether the offence is a serisous one and, if so, he will order the removal of the pensioner's name from the pension list from the date of commencement of imprisonment. Such a pensioner may however be readmitted to the pension establishment by the authority mentioned above on the man's application after release, but in no case will pension be sanctioned for the1 1 f 4 \ N r&gt; period of confineuient in jail for a serious -crime. (d)If in rhe opinion of the authority concerned •the criminal offence is nor so serious as to justify the removal of the pensioner’s name from the pension list* it mill not be removed and pension, for the period of confine ment in jail or of police or jail custody mill be .paid to him after release from such confinement or custody. (c) if a pensioner is imprisoned for debt or pending trial on a criminal charge of which he is subsequently acquitted or if he is convicted of a criminal charge by ,a lowar court but is acquitted, on appeal by a. higher court, pension will be admissible to him for .the entire period including any period spent in jail or in police or jail custody. • ' (d) When a case of grave misconduct not covered by paragraphs (a) to (c) above is brought to the notice of the district or independent brigade commander .he may, if he considers it justifiable, suspend the .pension of the individual concerned* He will subsequently investigeite the case and may reduce or withhold the pension or continue it * in full from a date to be specified by him not earlier th^ that on which the pension was orgihally suspended.h.f (2*) ^ Awali, Bahrein Island.

After some correspondence I received my pension certificate in June. I presented my pension certificate at the Bahrain Political Agency but payment could not be made to me. My pension certificate was taken from me and sent to the Postmaster, Gujrat, along with my Descriptive Roll as the entries regarding payment of my pension on these two documents did not tally. I have now received back my pension certificate. The cause of my not drawing my nension for the period from 1st April 1937 up to date is the delay in the tranfer of my pension papers to Bahrain.

His pension papers are not traceable, in I made a thorough search when he first called, but in vain. When he called again I went ever-the through the papers in my room and also through some old papers which T Trend recently transferred to the Old-Records Room, but without success. As ordered by you a further search was made during the Easter -holidays - this time with the help of Mr.Zafar Islam, who was the Accountant before I took over in January,last. We made a very exhaustive search, but no trace of the papers has been found. All pension papers have now been kept under lock and key. Before this they used to be in one of the drawers of the Accountant’s desk, all tied uo in a file- board. I have had oee-aeien so often to go through the bundle in connection with payments to other pensioners, but do not remember to have come across the papers of this pensioner among the lot. I am scrry that while taking over from my predecessor I did not list the pension documents that were in the drawer. / It is suggested that we write to the Deputy controller of Milltary Accounts &amp; Pensions, Lahore, expl-aining reporting the loss of the papers and reouesting ^ they be replaced.

The principal correspondents are: the Political Agent in Bahrain; the Controller (or Deputy Controller) of Military Pension Accounts [CMPA] in the Lahore Cantonment. The file is a direct chronological continuation of ‘Miscellaneous:– Payments of Military Pensions from the Bahrain Treasury and their Correspondence regarding’ (IOR/R/15/2/1519).Papers in the file include:copies of monthly statements (submitted by the Agency) of the names of pensioners transferred from the Bahrain Treasury to other Pension Disbursing Offices, and lists of pensions brought on the Check register of the Bahrain Treasury, for months covering period August 1938 to May 1944. Most statements and lists are marked ‘nil’;monthly statements of casualties amongst members of OBI, IOM, VC and MC (Order of British India, Indian Order of Merit, Victoria Cross, Military Cross) on the Pension Establishment in the payment of the Bahrain Treasury. Statements are marked ‘nil’;circular memoranda from the CMPA and other Government administrations, concerning various aspects of pension payments, such as procedure, policy, overpayments, fraud, pay increases, cases of Indian military pensioners convicted in criminal courts;correspondence relating to checks on the identity of individuals claiming pensions, including depositions made by pensioners and supporting statements (recorded at the Agency) and certificates of verification, issued by the Political Agent;papers relating to the transfer of pension payments.The file also includes: fragments of a pension certificate (ff 131-134) and two complete pension certificates, dated 1933 (ff 283-285) and 1925 (ff 304-305) respectively, the former with an accompanying pension warrant and record of payments (f 286). The pension certificates include terms and conditions printed in English, as well as in a number of other languages used on the Indian subcontinent, including Punjabi, Hindi and Tamil.An invoice is included in the file, dated 19 May 1932 (f 339), which has no obvious relation to surrounding correspondence, and was presumably included in the file in error.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Army</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Controller of Military Pension Accounts, Lahore</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Military pensions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000ff#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
