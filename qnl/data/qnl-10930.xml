He also suggests pensioning off the Amir of Zhali. This is followed by a second memorandum, by Lieutenant-General John William Schneider, who concurs with the suggestion to formalise British relations with the tribes. However, rather than pensioning off the Amir of Zhali, he proposes instead to inform the Amir that his subsidy would be continued only as long as he is recognised as Amir by a considerable portion of his tribesmen.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Zhali</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Zhali</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000058#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
