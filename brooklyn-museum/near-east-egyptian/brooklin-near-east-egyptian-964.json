The capital, which would have decorated the top of a small column, has slots to hold the walls of a chapel.

St. Sissinios is apparently shown killing his sister, whose daughter had been taken over by the devil. St. Thekla, who was converted to Christianity by St. Paul, is being martyred by two crudely rendered lions.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2009-05-06", "date_added": "2009-05-06 10:03:17", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [{"id": 190, "prefix": "", "name": "Coptic", "suffix": "", "nationality": "", "role": "Culture", "dates": "", "start_year": null, "end_year": null, "date_added": "2009-03-25", "rank": 1}], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "40.299", "object_id": 50218}, {"accession_number": "43.55", "object_id": 54575}, {"accession_number": "55.2.3", "object_id": 124486}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "40.300_PS2.jpg", "id": 28765, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/40.300_PS2.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/40.300_PS2.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 67}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 134}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 269}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 538}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1077}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/40.300_PS2.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": "Coptic. <em>St. Sissinios</em>, 6th century C.E.; modern reworking.
