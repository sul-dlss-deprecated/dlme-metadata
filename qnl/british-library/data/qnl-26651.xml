The Government of India have increased Ihsanullah’s pension by Rs.25 a month to Rs.128 a month, which perhaps will not be over satisfactory from his point of view if it is the case that his salary until retirement was about £600 per annum.

He seems to have done an immense amount for Indian pilgrims; indeed, his enforced retirement seems to be due largely to his zeal on their behalf. It would I feel be a great mistake from tte Government’s point of view to treat the case in such a way as to give the impression of ingratitude to a loyalRetirement of Khan Ihsanullah from post of Indian Vice-Consul at Jedda. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, who has 'been Indian Vice Consul at His Majesty's Legation at Jedda since 1918 has recently been com pelled, hy force of circumstances and through no fault of his ovm, to relinquish his post and take leave pending retirement. 2. His age is approximately 52 and he has a family. His salary until retirement was about £600 per annum. 3. His post was far from being a sinecure. His principal duty was the care and protection of the many pilgrims from India and other British territories who flocked each year on pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. This duty he has consistently carried out with sympathy and devotion during the whole of his service. 4. In a recent despatch to the Government of India (No.636/130/20 of the 24th April 1937, a copy of which has been sent to the India Office with Foreign Office letter E 2678/201/^5 of ../5/37) Sir R. Bullard has again testified to Ihsanullah’s s^endid work and has explained in convincing detail the reasons which have in the long run led to his enforced departure from Jedda. 5. Briefly, these are the continual intrigues against him by (a) certain Indian agitators with their own axes to grind and (b) the pilgrim guides, v/hose livelihood depended on the pilgrim ages and who at every turn found Ihsanullah a bulwark between their rapacity and the pilgrims whom they sought to fleece. 6. The intrigues of these persons have gradually succeeded in undermining Ihsanullah's influence not only with Saudi iirab Government officials but also with King Ibn Saud himself, with the result that he could no longer continue to hold his post in Jedda.7. Both Sir R. Bullard and Sir A. Ryan (his predecessor) Being aware of the growing opposition to Ihsanullah have from time to time sought to induce the Government of India to transfer him to some other post, hut without success. 8. The Government of India have every reason to signify their appreciation of his work in Jedda by transferring him to sdme other post, hut it appears that further employment cannot he found for him and meanwhile the question of the amount of pension that can he granted him is under consideration. In the ordinary way this pension will he very small, as the Government of India are only willing to take a certain amount of his service into consideration for pension purposes. 9. It is to he hoped however that as the result of the further consideration which the point is now receiving, he will he accorded exceptionally generous treatment and that apart from an adequate pension the question of granting him a retiring gratuity may also be favourably considered both as a reward for exceptionally good service rendered for many years in a difficult country with a notoriously had climate and as compensation for an unnecessarily early retirement, brought about mainly by his own devotion to duty.

So far as I am concerned, I should not like to leave undone anything that I could properly do to help Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, who, as Bullard rightly remarks, has deserved well of the state, so if you can ensure his letter being given to the Nawab, I should be very grateful.

If he can be given a job at Aden (as to which A we cannot expect to hear for a little while from the Colonial Office) he will evidently have to retire, and in this case what Mr. Rendel suggests in para.5 of his le-tter of 17th April seems reasonable. Moreover, if he has to retire, it seems reasonable that he should be allowed to count for pension his service prior to 1926, although that service was not technically on a permanent basis. You will see from P.Z.7276/31 (flagged on the file below) that the Government of India did promise in 1931 to give this matter favourable consideration, if necessary, when the time for Ihsan Ullah's retirement came. Since it appears to be desired that Ihsaru^Ullah should go on leave at the end of this month, and in view of Mr. Rendel’s special request for us to take son© action to help Sir R. Bullard, you may feel disposed to send Sir A. Metcalfe a private telegram. I attach a draft.n '■ C’ O /'■&gt; ,:oZu p/ c l iFOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 17th April, 1937.

The most satisfactory solution would be for the Government of India to find him other suitable employment inside or outside India. But if this is absolutely impossible we strongly support.

J.C.Walton Esq., C.B,, M.C. ^ x iD.-v Jr-HCt treatment/treatment in the matter of (a) leave pending his enforced retirement and (h) the pension to he allowed him. 4. As regards (a), in view of the possibilities at which Bullard hints in paragraph 2 of his telegram to the Government of India we cannot help feeling here that the sooner Ihsanullah says good-bye to Jedda the better for all concerned. 5. We therefore strongly support the suggestion that Ihsanullah should be allowed to proceed on leave at once, and should welcome an assurance that if another suitable post cannot be found for him in the meantime the fact of his taking leave at this stage will not prejudice him in any way as regards the enjoyment in addition of the combined leave prior to retirefftfttrt which he would have received at the normal time (i.e. at the end of this year) if his service had not suffered interruption. We should be very grateful for any help you can give in this matter. 6. With regard to (b) (the question of Ihsanullah's pensionable service) it may be helpful for you to refer to the copies of correspondence which formed the subject of India Office printed letter P.Z. 7^5/31 of the k;4th November 1931/■■■ r ■ wipw—i—- J;. 1931 to the Foreign Office especially hope Gill’s despatch No.83 of the 5th Augast 1951 to the Government of India. 7.

I am informed by Metcalfe that the Government of India cannot offer ifesanullah another post and suggest that he should take leave due (about eighteen months) and then retire on his pension of about £8 a month. This would mean ruin for Ibsanullah and complete triumph to the enemies of His Majesty’s Government to whom the trouble is largely due. 2. Retention of Ibsanullah is likely to become increasingly difficult if not impossible. Further intrigues here caused trouble about embarking pilgrims and there are signs that Saudi-Arabian Government will shortly demand his removal. I should be greatly relieved if he could go honourably but his removal on any other terms would, I think, be an act of ingratitude to him besides being injurious to the interests of His Majesty’s Government and of the pilgrims. 3. Work in Aden seems to be expanding. Would there be room for Ibsanullah there. He knows Arabic perfectly.

Will you please refer to Hyan # s personal and secret letter No.3. &amp; G 71Q/V278, dated the 28th May 1936 f re^rding Khan Balmdur Iheanullah and the possibility of finding him employment in India. We have had this matter under consideration previously but in these days of localised recruitment and eonrounal representation in the services it is practically impossible to find a post into which the Khan Bahadur can be fitted, the more so as his qualifications do not fit him for any ordinary employment in India. If he is to make an honourable exit from Jeddah the possibilities are further restricted by the pay and status of his present appointment of Indian Vice Consul. The Accountant General, Central :ie venues, however, informs us that if the Khan Bahadur remains on uninterrupted duty till the end of this year he will be entitled to combined leave for eighteen months ending in 1939, the year he is due to retire, and he will then be entitled to a superannuation pension of &lt;8.110/6/- with effect from the 1st July 1939. It might, therefore, be the best solution tolet the Khan Bahadur stay on to the end of this year and then proceed on leave pending retirement. Yours sincerely, Sd/-. H.A.F. Metcalfe.

(S 5014/4043/25) My dear Walton, I y- / S Would you ret’er^ to our L official P.L.No. E 5014/ 4043/25 of 10th September, enclosing copies of of 21st July on the subject of the woman Ayesha who had taken refuge in the house of Khan Bahadur 2. The incident has I think in so far as the liquidated, but we have had under consideration its repercussions in so far as they affect the position of the Khan Bahadur and his continued usefulness at Jedda, and we have been able to take advantage of the presence in England of both Ryan and Bullard to go into this question with them. 3. For some time Ryan has felt that it would be in the interest of Ihsanulla, wno in his opinion Jedda despatches No. 208 of 14th July and No. 222 Ihsanulla the Indian Vice Consul in Jedda? Legation are concerned, been more or less satisfactorily has/ J. C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C.has deserved excellently of the Government of India and of the Legation, if he could be found another post elsewhere, but some two years ago the Government of India were unable to accede to a recommendation put forward by Ryan in this sense. I understand from him that he has recently renewed his recommendation in a personal letter to Sir A. Metcalfe in which he made it quite clear that he would only favour Ihsanulla’s removal if he could be appointed to some other respectable post, so that he should not suffer by having to retire on the very small pension to which apparently he would be entitled, and so that his removal should not appear to be a victory for his Saudi and Indian enemies. Bullard is also of opinion that Ihsanulla has outlived his usefulness at the Legation in Jedda, but is equally concerned that his removal should not penalise him and should not appear as a triumph to intriguers outside and inside the Legation. 4. With these opinions we generally concur, and I should be very grateful if you could see your wayto induce the G-overnment of India to give the matter their early and sympathetic consideration. 5, It occurs to us that if the Government of India can arrange to find Ihsanulla another suitable post, it would be a great convenience to the Legation if arrangements could be made for his successor, who would clearly need very careful selection, to take up his duties at Jedda before the beginning of the next pilgrimage season.

Your telegram No. 87 [of June 50th: Alleged abduction by ]nd]an Fice-Consui of former feraj.e oervanu I have received your despatch No. 195 [of June 50th]. ± approve your attitude and trust you have been able to sett!/ the woman’s disposal amicably. It seems cloar that Ihs&amp;nuilah merely extended hospitality to an old servant who sought refuge ol her own accord. There was nothing priia a facie improper or illegal in his action. Nor is there any present ground for com- pellun^ nim to turn the woman out oi his house. On the other iiund, if and when you have cognisance of a judicial order requir ing her appearance before a Court or her return to her husband, immuniuy oi legation cannot be allowed to stand in the way of its enxorcement and you should instruct Ihsanullah to cause woman to leave his house so that Court older can be enforced. j. co not coHolder it desirable to pursue the suggestion that husbanu should give guarantee or assurance of good treatment, .livery el fore should be made to ride off any attempt to subject Ihsanullah to criminal jurisdiction, and if Yusuf Yasin persists, you should inform him that you must refer to me for instructions. ms regards tone adopted in Yusuf Yasin T s letter of June 28th, I am inclined to ignore it, but this aspect of matter will be t urther considered on receipt of report by telegram how matter now stands.

On June 16th I received official note from Saudi Arabian G-overnment stating that it was alleged that after pilgrimage Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, Indian vice-consul, sent his car to house of a certain Hausav/i in kecca and took away man's wife who in the past had been servant in Ihsanullah's house at Jedda.. I was reguested to instruct Ihsanullah to attend local police court for interrogation. 2. As Yusuf Yasin had referred to this matter in conversa tion with Ihsanullah on April 26th I took the course of replying by personal letter to him to pla.ce what iurther information I could at his disposal. I enclosed a statement oy Ihsanullah and drew attention to the followingi (a) woman stated that sue had been denied admission to her husband, had previously been deprived of food, and treated with cruelty, (b) she. took refuge of her own accord with Ihsanullah' s wife in Mecca when he himself was in Jedda - she had been servant for five years in Ihsanullah's house, (c) no car v/as sent to husbaoid's house, (d) she came to Jedda with Ihsanullah's family. 3. In studiedly conciliatory terms (for I was aware of animus in certain baudi circles) I pointed out that on humanitarian grounds it w r ould have been difficult to refuse shelcer and stating my desire to be of assistance suggested that woman might return to husband if he gave assurances of considerate treatment. 4. I have now received lengthy personal letter from Yusuf inV in reoly couched in strong if not immoderate language.. It expresses [grp. undec.J and great astonishment at statements which he asserts admitted that Ihsanullah carried off the v/oman without her husband’s permission, .setter requests with drawal of paragraph in which I suggested that the woman should return to husband upon guarantee as Saudi Arabian Government cannot accept it as there is’’nothing in international rights to justify or support such action 1 ’ and friendship between the two countries “does not permit it i: . It also requests unconditional and immediate return of the woman to her husband and ends by describing the action of Ihsanullah as illegal and reserving freedom of government to pursue the case by recourse to laws 5. Full details follow by bag which you may prefer bo await. I report by telegraph because I am convinced that this violent reaction has deeper implications. The affair has been deliberately magnified in order to attack Indian Vice-Consul’s position and though the woman took refuge as long ago as the end of February attack was only launched two days after departure of His majesty’s Minister. It may be the prelude to a more general attack on legation immunities. 6. I expect to see Yusuf Yasin on July 4th when I shall take strong exception to tone of letter and stress the friend liness of my letter and of my suggestion for amicable solution of a matter only igrp. omtd.] at the sta^e of police enouiry. I will endeavour to settle the woman's disposal by friendly arrange ment but I feel I cannot allow Yusuf Yasin's unwarrantable acnion to pass and I am anxious that I may be instructed as to how wo meet any further similar outburst.

It discusses his duties as pilgrimage officer, which consist of protecting and catering for pilgrims from India and other British territories, and names those groups that are deemed by the British to be responsible for the intrigues against him. Ihsanullah's zeal on behalf of Indian pilgrims is also mentioned as being a factor, since it is reported to have caused friction between Ihsanullah and the Saudi authorities.The correspondence includes discussion of the possibility of Ihsanullah being transferred to Aden, the arrangements for Ihsanullah's pension, the effect that his retirement is likely to have on Indian pilgrims, and the question of who should succeed him in his post. The principal correspondents regarding this matter are the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India (Sir Samuel Findlater Stewart), His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Reader William Bullard), and officials of the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Government of India's Foreign Department (later External Affairs Department).Also included is correspondence between His Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires, Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert), and the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which discusses the case of a former servant of Ihsanullah's who sought refuge from her husband with Ihsanullah and his family.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
