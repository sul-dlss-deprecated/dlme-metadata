Unfortunately there is not a single Arabic newspaper in Egypt which can be relied upon to be consistently pro-British particularly In regard to such controversial questions as Palestine and the Ha&amp;ramaut. It would be impracticable therefore to circulate any exist ing publication for distribution in the Dutch East Indies as is suggested. It so happened, however, that at the time of the receipt of your letter under reply we had been considering the possibility of starting a publication of our own. There had been various objections to this idea, which we need not enumerate here, but the fact that the Consul-General in Batavia had expressed a definite opinion that the dissemination of pro-British news would be appreciated finally decided us to adopt this experiment, particularly as it does not commit us to any capital expenditure or long term liability. We have thus produced, after considerable delays and difficulties, a magazine entitled 'Sahrat el Sharq' , some copies of the first issue of which are enclosed herewith together/ Eastern Department, Foreign Office, London, B.W.l.■together with a precis of its contents* This publication aims at disseminating in the guise of light reading matter news and views calculated to react to the credit of British administration and prestige, but it is far from being blatant propaganda* It should be noted that the first number contains no advertisements, and this fact alone may conceivably lead the public to believe that the publication does not rely entirely on its own financial resources, but is backed by some outside agency* For this reason we do not consider it advisable to engage a wholesale free distribution ot this magazine as suggested by Fitsilsurice until (a) a certain number of advertisements can be secured (b) the sales effected give us some sort of assurance that it is appreciutt;d by the public and (o) we have had independent and objective comment on the magazine itself from the embassy at Baghdad, the Legation at Jedda and the Consulates in Syria* Meanwhile ve should be grateful if you could forward a few specimens of the magazine to batavia by safe hand, ascertain from FitzKaurice us to whether this is the type of material he considers suitable and ask him to let us have a number of names and addresses to which the proprietor of the magazine could profitably send copies oi the magazine in the event of the experiment being continued. We shall, ourselves, write to the missions and consulates in the Hear Kast* It has occurred to us that you yourselves might like to have an independent opinion on the 'Zahrat al bharq' before sending it to Batavia and, if so, we might mention that a copy has been sent to Mr* Hillelson of the Pubj-ic Relatione Division of the British Broadcasting Corporation, who is known to the Hews Department and reads Arabic* With/With regard to Fltz Mayrice's second suggestion namely that of organising lecture tours f we are considering names of certain individuals whom we might conceivably send to the Far Bast with this specific object in view and are also keeping a look out for prospective visitors who might be able to give a lecture or two in the course of their normal activities* We are sending a copy of this letter to the News Department.

The pilgrimage was organised throughout by the Italian authorities. Each Hajl after paying Lire 3000 to the Governemnt before his departure incurred no further expenditure. It is evident that the Haj was sudsidised by the Government as Lire 3000 is a small sum to pay for the facilities which were enjoyed. 3. I am informed that generous rations o/ 2 tea, sugar, rice, butter and other food were distributed daily. One cook was allotted to every 10 persons. In the Hejaz one sheep or goat was given to every 6 persons daily, good accommodation was provided, and each pilgrim received #1 a day for personal expenses. In addition to the adtnlt members of the Haj a few boys under 12 years of age, travelling with their fathers, were taken free of charge. 4. From larar the pilgrims were conveyed by lorry to ?/agadiscio. Thence by a socially chartered ship to Jeddah. On the return journey they were detained twice, at Mogadiscio and at the Dagahbour, by quarantine necessitated by the Illness and subsequent death of one of the pilgrims. 6.

HARARI HAJIS LEAVE FOR THE HEJAZ Tha Italian Government encouraged the people to journey to the aacred places Oecca and Medina) to perform the Haj* This is the custom and the people welcome this noble act with ardent wishes for the continous victdry of the Government • On the morning of Friday the 31st December all the hajig # together with their friends and relations and belongings, betook themselves to the square in front of the Governor^ Palace. I Therewere so many of them and it was so crowded that it seemed as if the whole square was rising ad falling in waves. The eye of the beholder was dazzled as it might be on the day of the •Aeed of ’Arafat. The Government deserves thanks for the way It has eased the journey for them by the provision of all manner of comforts both on the outward and return voyages. Thus, it had prepared 13 large lorries to transport them to Mogadiscio whence it had arranged the voyage to Jedda. This was the second Faj to be &gt; made under the auspices of the blessed Fascist Government. The chauffeurs were told to stop wherever the Hajis wanted them to do so in order that they might fulfil their duties (prayers) by the side of the places at which water was to be fnd to supply their needs (washing, coffee etc.). It Is worthy of mention that the Government, when It learnt that i the majority of the pilgrims were going on the F?aj but not visiting the tomb of the Prophet owing to its distance and the great expense, promised them that this year every HajI would visit Medina. This was because of the Governments / grea tgreat respect for the Word and their merciful attitude to poor Moslems. Oh Lord Thou knowest that our brothers the Hajls leave their homes and their children in obedience to Thy command and in fulfilment of their duties to Thee. Give them hope and accept their Haj, and support and aid their helpers (the Italians).

This vessel belongs to the Lloyd Triestino Line but is on permanent charter by the Italian Govern ment as a troopship, and has only been taken off troop ing work for the pilgrim season.

Ahile at present disturbances and massacres are takin,; place in Palestine, Transjordan and Morocco, from the Italian Empire conquered two years ago, is setting out the greatest pilgrimage of Moslems with the assistance of the Government. This affords striking proof of the loyalty of the Italian subjects and of the sympathy of the whole Islamic world for Rome* The pilgrimage comprises 1,850 Moslems from all the governments of the Empire* The 'Sannio 1 , chartered by the Government, has already embarked the pilgrims assembled at Mogadiscio and will go on to Massav/a to pick up the main body* The Moslems of Somaliland, Harar and southern Jimma assembled at Mogadiscio while the pilgrims from Addis Ababa, Amhara, the2 J 2 - the northern part of Jirnraa and Eritrea are going to Massaca* 1,85C Moslems with their chiefs and their Sultans, iiore than 250 of these - Somalis, _ritreans, Gall as and natives from all over the ittipire - are going on this pilgrimage at Government expense as a reward for their conduct during the war, or because they are performing duties and functions under the protection of the Government, or on account of other civil merits. #e emphasise this detail as an illustration of the attention with which the Viceregal Government follows the behaviour of its subjects, and to show that it never forgets those who have deserved well of it and who continue to do so; it is a detail of the vast work of Imperial policy - generous and civilised - which the Fascist regime is also carrying out in the lands of Africa. But Italian help is apparent in every aspect of the pilgrimage. The rt Cit' (Compagnia Italians di Turismo) has organised particularly the transport over the roads of the Empire, the crossing of the led Sea, the stay in Jedda and the journey to Mecca. Throughout the whole journey the pilgrims will have at their disposal the medical service which has been arranged and a minutely prepared assistance-scheme. The Addis Ababa caravan, equipped by the Governorate of the City, sets off tomorrow morning with the 60 Moslem participants. .Ve visited the Arab community; the chiefs had no time for us today, preparations going on andand conversation which all bore upon the great event which was to take place. Only the secretary of Said Ahmed told us about the Great Bairam, about Abraham carrying his son up the mountain of Mecca (sic) and ordaining the pilgrimage, about the sacrifice of the ram, and about the carpet which the pilgrims of ligypt carry to the great Mosque in accordance with at e-old tradition.

Bo. 19 January 15th, 1938 Sir In reply to your despatch ho. 109 (£i 6732/10/91) of the 20th UoveTiber last on the subject of anti-British articles published in the ^abic publication n Atturjunan' at Batavia, I have the honour to report that I have made such enquiries as are possible, and can obtain no definite indication that this propaganda was inspired from Italian sources. 2. , 4 k trustworthy i-*.rab informant (Seyyid Kussein .JjxxiV.S) tells me that since the editor, Seyyid Mohamad bin .nQIL, has been warned by the authorities (as reported in my despatch ho. 207 Confidential of the 4th December last) the tone of the paper has completely changed, and is now rather pro-British than otherwise. Seyyid Mohamad bin ^GIL has apparently stated openly to his friends that he wrote the undesirable articles to arouse mere interest and to obtain more subscribers for his paper, and that he has changed his tune on receiving a police warning. Seyyid Hussein ^LnibkS therefore sees no reason todespite the fact that (as he says) Italy has in the past year spent about £60,000.*- on propaganda in i*rabia • 3. That some propaganda destined for the large Mohammedan population of Java is inspired by Italian sources is, however, fairly clearly proved by the enclosed translation of an article published in a Batavia daily, ’’De Vo Iks stem”, on the 6 th instant. I drew Seyyid Hussein attention to this article, and asked his opinion of it. He said the statements, e.g. in regard to the Imam of Yemen’s alleged approval of Mussolini’s policy, were sheer nonsense, and would find little credence among educated JTk rabs. 4. ^t the same time, both he, and another leading ^vrab at Batavia whom I have sounded separately (Seyyid ^li bin ^chmad bin SlirJl^B), think that propaganda of this nature may do some little harm in creating a false imi^ression among ignorant ^rabs, and among semi-educated natives of the Netherlands East Indies. Both these gentlemen have expressed the view that some*counter-propaganda is called for and might serve a very useful purpose. 5. Borne remarks made by the .adviser for Native .affairs (Doctor G. E. PIJPKR) in conversation with me yesterday seem to underline the desirability of such counter-propaganda. Doctor Pijper said (on the subject of the trend of native opinion in the Chinese-Japanese conflict) that the whole history of the Javanese showed that in regard to the differences of other nations the dominant feeling among the Javanese/Javanese always was a desire to t&gt;e on friendly terms with the winning side. Jrom this it may well he deduced that Italian propaganda of the type of the enclosed article is exactly the sort of material to influence popular opinion. 6 . I do not of course wish to suggest that no articles giving the British side are appearing. Buch articles as the enclosed (untranslated) extract from the ‘'Java Bode’’ of January 14th (a statement from Lord Lloyd on the work of the British Council) are widely read in colonial Dutch circles, hut do not reach the .urah and native circles whom I am now considering. 7. a,s you are already aware, there is a aadrami -,j?ah population in Java alone of about 50,000, and this group exercises an influence among Java’s 45,000,000 inaigenous inhabitants far out of proportion to its actual numbers. It is suggested tnat 50 to 100 copies of a few suitable periodicals issued in Lgypt (say 1 or 2 monthly, and 1 or 2 weekly or fortnightly periodicals, and, if practicable, 1 daily) might be usefully sent to -iU?ab addressees in the Netherlands Last Indies who could read them and pass the papers or the news around. If such an arrangement meets with your approval I would, after consulting separately the two ^rab gentlemen mentioned, prepare a list of addresses to which the papers could be sent, - preferably direct, as this would avoid giving these periodicals the appearance of propaganda put out by this Consulate-General. 6 . I'o obviate the risk that recipients might return such periodicals unopened from the fear that acceptance/11./ acceptance would involve liability to pay a sub scription, I could arrange Tor influential ^rab friends to write to prospective recipients saying tnat they had reco luended the latter as suitable recipients of a special free issue of periodicals containing the news of the dayo 9. Visits of religious teachers or other lecturers fron friendly-disposed Islamic countries such as I-gypt, India, Irah, etc.., would also be a useful neans of inforning local opinion. Such visitors would, be practically certain of an interested hearing in the Netherlands x^ast Indies, and it night, of course, be considered worth while to include other neighbouring countries in their itinerary. instance of the keen interest aroused by visitors of this type was recently shown when hr. ^bdulharaid ^L-C^hT , a menber of the Council of King Ibn baud of baudi Arabia visited Java in November last: he / had large ana enthusiastic audiences, though he had very little of interest to say apart fron general praise for i.in^ Ibn baud's adninistration. If any such visits as I have suggested can be staged, and if I can be given advance information, it would, I think, be possible without much difficulty to arrange a little discreet ‘publicity in the local vernacular press to arouse some interest for the coming visitor. 10 . I shall be grateful to be informed in due course if you desire any action to be taken to give effect to these suggestions.11. Coi^ies of this despatch are being sent to the Governor of the btraits bettleuients; Governnent of India; Governor of ^den; his F.ajesty f s Ministers at The Hague (ho.14 Confidential); Bangkok (ho.15 Confidential); Special Branch, Straits Settlements Police, Singapore.

Translation from 'De Volks 8 teIn ,, , Batavia, of January 6 th, 1938. IT^LY Tli; MOHiJ-aiiSD^ wORLD. (By a special contrihutor). The Message of the Imam of Yemen to Mussolini is well-known: '’we are eternally thankful for the political attitude of the Italian Government to the Moslem, countries, and we hope that such a policy may always progress.'* ««.lso, the declaration of the Mufti after arrival in Syria: r ’'The imglish must look out lest 'by their Palestine policy they alienate the sympathies of the ^rabian, and even of the whole Moslem world. we are not alone in our struggle, and shall resist to the last”. bignificant also is the news issue of the Italian press, which has from the beginning given special attention to the agitation spreading from Palestine through the ^rab world. More, it is unanimously against the British mandate policy. The «rab problem is related to the political equilibrium of the Mediterranean, where Italy is ever-present. The pan-vj?abian solidarity shown after the British measures against the Grand Mufti spread like lightning through Italy’s colonial possessions. The uo^acuaedens of Libya and Abyssinia are solid with the -.Tabs in Palestine. Collections on behalf of the 'victims of the Lnglish terror” are organised, and it is even suggested that the Grand Mufti will settle in Libya; Mussolini/Mussolini h as n ev er underest i mated Islam as a political factor. ^11 the Italian colonies border on **rab states, ^bout 5,000,000 Mohammedans live as loyal Italian subjects within the Empire. On the Red bea Italy is neighbour to two important powers. Mussolini’s Islam policy was already, during his trip to Libya in March this (sic) year, the object of foolish comment in connection with his speech at Tripoli and the symbolic handing-over of the sword of Islam. Since then the ears of Italians are sharpened for events in the ^rab world. For might not the conflict of the ^rabs in falestine bring other ^rab states to revise their political relations with England? In any case the assembling of Saudi Arabian troops on the Trans-jordania frontier was appreciated in Italy as the first political reaction of the hitherto underestimated pan-^rabian movement against the ’’mailed fist” of England. ^nd what are the Mufti’s plans? Italy, it is said, wants no territorial gains nor does she wish to assume England’s role of protector* The Italians certainly, however, take a different view of the methods to be applied in the exercise of the mandate. The way France does her will over the heads of the people in byria is strongly scourged by public opinion in Italy, and, on the subject of the British mandate in Palestine, the ’’Stampa” recently wrote that the stir in Palestine could only be diminished by a definite renunciation/renunciation of the partition plan« -without reserve the ^abs should 'be accorded the prior claim to the contested Palestine* In these ways Italy assures herself the sympathies of the ilchammedan world. It must however he aaded that Rome has conducted a clearly outlined ^rah policy for some years. This pc .icy is already hearing fruit. Friendly relations link Italy in particular to the Kingdom of Yemen. The treaty of commerce and friendship of 1926, whereby Italy was the first European power to recognize Yemen, was renewed on September 15th. The document contained a formal recognition of the Italian Empire. Practically, the old agreement stands: Italy recognises the sovereignty of Imam Yahya, and he undertakes to buy in Italy material necessary for the economic development of his land# In addition, he confirmed his friendship for Italy in a letter to the Duce published by the Italian press on October 16th, in which emphasis was laid on certain questions. Then came a present of ;*rab horses for the King, the Crown Prince, Mussolini and Count Ciano. Italy has also maintained good relations with the hodjaz since 1932. The treaty of friendship then concluded guarantee^ Mobam^sdan subjects of Italy protection on their visits to the holy places in Mecca. That this was not a mere paper guarantee was shown last February, when Italy, for the first time in Abyssinia, organised many pilgrimages to Mecca. In the war in Abyssinia/4 -ibyssinia her treaties with ^ah nations secured their r* neutrality. hov/here v/ere voices heard on behalf of i aile ^&gt;elassi, and Italy’s neutrality policy in the time of the dangerous conflict between Ibn baud and Yahya of Yemen bore fruit. hgypt is the key position in Italy’s oriental policy. This is a corollary of its geographical position. But the kingdom of Parouk is, with the Soudan, enclosed by Italian colonies. In Lgypt the Italians have a stronger 1 position than would appear from their number, 50,000. jiussolini takes every occasion to emphasise his friendly feelings for the Egyptian people. Recently, too, when he allayed by a special statement the mistrust of Egyptian politicians on the establishment of the 20 th and 21 st •^rmy Oorps in Libya. Italy also couched in very friendly terms its relinquishment of capitulations when the iiontreux agreement of Hay 8 th was signed. Italy’s Islam policy has thus been long set up. It leads to no suppression of, or protectorate over, the ..ionammedan world.

Acland asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether his attention has been called to the intensified Italian broadcast propaganda in Arabic; and whether the British diplomatic repre sentatives abroad are asked to report on its nature and effect? Mr. Eden: The answer to both parts of the question is, Yes, Sir. Mr. Acland: Would it not be worth while to let the Italians know that unless this broadcasting stops His Majesty’s Government will have to consider broad casting in Italian? Mr. Eden: Perhaps the hon. Member will await the answer to another question on that point. Sir William Davison: How long will it be before a proper broadcasting station is erected in Cyprus, or some other site on the Mediterranean, which will give proper British news and correct false statements?

Henderson asked the Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can now make a statement on the full reports received by His Majesty’s Govern ment in connection with Italian propa ganda in Palestine? RTOMr. Eden: Yes, Sir. In view of certain reports which had been received of Italian propaganda in the Near and Middle East, I recently informed the Italian Ambas sador that His Majesty’s Government were well aware of this propaganda and added that unless it could be brought to an end, it would be impossible to create the atmo sphere necessary to the prosecution of successful conversations designed to im prove our mutual relations. Mr. Henderson: Has any reply been received to that representation? Mr. Eden: I said that it was a recent conversation. Mr. Acland: If it is possible that the Italians do not desire conversations to go on, would the right hon. Gentleman make representations, as I suggested in an earlier question, that we should start broadcasting in Italian? Mr. Eden: I think that, as far as the broadcast of news in the Near East is con cerned, the House is aware that there is at the present time a broadcast of news in Arabic from Palestine. Mr. Acland: Would not Italian be use ful, too? Mr. Noel-Baker: Is not this propaganda absolutely without any precedent of any kind, and is it not an intolerable out rage? Mr. Henderson: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether the Italian propaganda has ceased since the repre sentation was made? Mr. Eden: No, Sir. Mr. Herbert Morrison: In view of the fact that nearly every Government in the world is disseminating news or propa ganda in foreign languages, why does the Foreign Office—presumably it is the Foreign Office—restrain the British Broadcasting Corporation from dissemi nating straight British new r s in German and Italian as well as in Arabic? Mr. Eden: The right hon. Gentleman must not assume that the Foreign Office is restraining anybody from doing any thing of that kind. At the moment, as I have said, news is being distributed in a number of foreign languages. Mr. Morrison: Only in Arabic and Spanish. Mr. Eden: Perhaps the right hon.

XfluLt, (E 5616/27/91) 21st October, 1937 Dear Gibson, We have now considered the suggestion about an Arabic translation of the book 'Desert Encounter', referred to in Clauso^s letter and enclosures to Johnstone of the 18th September (p.Z. 6173/37). 2. The circulation of an Arabic translation of this book, v/hich is a violent attack on Italian rule in North Africa, would, we think, be restricted to a small number of educated Arabs, who are by no means unaware of what Italian colonial methods imply. We agree with Clauson that in Arabia the spoken word is a far more efficacious method of counteracting Italian propaganda than the written word, and we are therefore inclined to pin our faith to a discreet use of wireless broadcasting. We believe that our propaganda should be rather pro-British than anti-Italian, since there is no danger of Italian atrocities/ J.P. Gibson, Esq. RECP. l 220071937. INDIA OFFICEatrocities in Litiya and Abyssinia being forgotten by the Arabs. 3. Moreover the circulation of such a book as this, which the Italians would certainly attribute to official inspiration, would seriously weaken our case in protesting against the Italian attacks on us in the Near East, 4. For these reasons we are not inclined to favour the idea of putting out an Arabic translation of this book. Yours sincerely,P 'i 1 / ° £ india omex f P.Y.1949/37.

(I am ashamed to say 1 have not myself read 'Desert Kncounter'.) I gathered from the other Dep^rtment^ that in their view counter-Italian propaganda in T Jrdu and Persian wae not much needed since in India and Persia at any rate there is little disposition to be impressed with the Italians, while in Afghanistan the standard of literacy is not such as to provide a market for a book of this kind. As to the usefulness of a book in Arabic, in which language the Italian propaganda is of course mainly/2 . mainly conducted, it vae thought best to consult the expert* at the Foreign Office, though I gathered the Tie* here to be thrt propaganda by spoken word is considered by the experts to be more effect!re than by translated books which could only have a limited appeal among the educated public.

He thinks that this book, written by a disinterested non-Britisher and based on his personal experience, should be transalated into Urdu, Persian, and Arabic, and he says it will open the eyes of Musalmans to the bitter facts of Italian rule in Nortnern Africa, and they would then realise how far Mussolini can justly claim to be the TT ?rotector of Islam'.

I have the honour to enclose herewith a summary of a statement made to me by an influential Arab, which seems to indicate that Italian anti- British propaganda has lately extended to certain Hadramis in Java. 2. As I reported in my despatch No. 64 of Hay 15 th on local coronation celebrations, the large Arab community took a prominent part in the festivities held at Batavia, and made a very impressive demonstra tion of the warm loyalty felt by Kadramis generally towards the British Crown. The leading figure in organising this demonstration, Seyyid Hussein bin Abdullah ALATAS, referred to in paragraph 19 of the despatch just quoted, is my present informant . 3. It appears that only one small group of the Arab followers of the Alatas family,- namely, the bin BISHR section of the ANNAUDI clan, refrained His Majesty’s Principal Secretary from of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, L 0 N D 0 N , S.7. 1 .from participation in the coronation celebrations. This aroused the suspicion of Seyyid Kussein ALATAS, and the enquiries he has made have led him to suspect that the bin BISHR section have received instructions from the Hadramaut. He has also learned that the leading member of this section in Batavia, Ombarak bin Salim bin Saleh bin BISHR ANNAHDI, is in touch with the Italian Consulate at Batavia. 4. Apart from the abstention of the bin BISHR section from coronation festivities, it does not appear that such propaganda has yet achieved anything in Java. Seyyid Hussein ALATAS feels, however, that a risk exists that, if money from Italy is forthcoming Ombarak bin BISHR might be able to establish a new Arab society here, and try to bring other Hadramis within its influence. 5* Seyyid Hussein ALATAS is pursuing enquiries further, and has promised to report to me all he can ascertain. He is incidentally, King Ibn Saud’s local propagandist for encouragement of the pilgrim traffic, and has probably a greater personal influence than any other Arab in the Netherlands East Indies; it may therefore be h 6 ped that he can pick up any available information.

S E C H E T « Batavia, June 4th, 1937• Seyyid Hussein bin Abdullah ALATAS reports:- There seems to be some disloyalty operating in the bin BISKR clan, a family which has in the past been loyal, and associated with the Alatas family, 2, Early in May his suspicion was roused, during the course of the collection of funds for the coronation celebrations, by the fact that some members of the bin Bishr clan said that they were prepared to subscribe if their names were not disclosed. Their subscriptions were declined on the ground that all names were to be given to the committee. 3, Following on this suspicion, enquiries were sent on May 8 th to other centres in Java to ascertain the attitude of members of the bin Bishr clan towards the celebrations organised by the Alatas family. It was later learned that on May 12th none of the bin Bishr clan attended these celebrations, either at Batavia, Surabaya, or Samarang, 4, A prominent Arab at Pekalongan named Suleiman bin Bishr bin Mohamad bin BISHR was ashed by the Samarang committee to attend the coronation reception arranged there, but did not do so, saying, a few days before May 12th, that he had to journey from Samarang on T7 urgent business” 5* On May 5 th , at about 8 .I 3 p.m. OMBAEAK bin Salim bin Saleh bin BISKR ANTI AUDI, of Batavia and Buitenzorg, visited the Italian Consulate with another man of his own clan. The latter, whose name is not known, waited outside. From.From that day onward none of the bin Bishr clan came either to Seyyid Hussein Alatas or to any of the meetings held to prepare coronation celebrations, 6 , The two rnen named, with OMBARAK bin Salim bin Ali b in BISHR of Poerwokerto, Banjoemas, are the most important members of the bin BISHR section of the ALHAHDI in Java, 7, Any propaganda put out in Batavia will probably reach the other two bin Bishr men named, 8 , If money is forthcoming it is quite possible they could establish a new society, and try and bring some other Arabs under their influence, 9 « The present attitude of members of the bin Bishr clan here makes Seyyid Hussein Alatas suspect that the clan has received instructions from the Kadramaut, He conjectures they may have come under Italian influence there. He is now making enquiries from the Kadramaut. 10, In regard to Italian efforts to acquire influence, Seyyid Hussein Alatas states that the Italians made/great bid last year to acquire prestige among Arabs by running free pilgrim ships from Massawah. Pilgrims were not only carried to Jeddah free of charge, but were well looked after on board.io P A B L n ^(4 Department, ^ BY NOTICE. Session 193^ Under Secretary Parliamentary Under Secre tary.

Sir, I have the honour to report that the local newspaper, the 'Corriere Hararino’ 1 , started, on April SI, to publish one of its columns in Arabic. As will be seen from the first of these, of which I enclose a rough translation, the object of this innovation is propaganda pure and simple. 2. The succeeding articles have consisted of nothing other that extracts from Signore Mussolini^ various speeches of recent date. I have, etc., (Signed) T. WIKELEY Acting Consul His Majesty’s Consul General, Addis AbabaTRANSLATION OF EXTRACT FROM CORRIERE HARARINO OF 31 April, 1937 (original in Arabic) IMPERIAL ITALY The great Duce (za'im) Benito Mussolini spoke to the Italians and said: rt You are to become powerful in the eyes of the whole world as you were in the days of the Emperor Augustus'. The Fascist Government is a powerful Government and strong in its union and agreement with the whole nation. Then it made war, conquered, and was victorious with overwhelming strength, and it gave to the Ethiopian nation peace, and freed them from their bonds. The Government does not forget what it owes to Moslems in the way of thanks and love because they were on its side during the Ethiopian war; nor are Moslems ignorant of what they have received in the way of kindness and friendship from the Fascist Government whose solicitude (for them) dates from a long time back. As the Italians feel friendship and solicitude towards Moslems, so the latter bear friendship and good will towards the Italian Government. Moslems are not unaware of the things the Fascist Government has done for the Moslems of Lybia. Under their rule there is complete justice and equity. Furthermore all Moslems know that the Fascist policy recognises (the value) of Moslem civilization. This strengthens and uplifts Moslems. Fascist Italy does not oppress Moslems with her sword, but strengthens them and uplifts their religion. The proof of the sincere affection felt for the Italian Government by Moslems is that when the great Duce visited Lybia the Moslem population gave him the Sword of Islam set with gems and covered with gold. This shows clearly how happy and contented theythey are with the policy of the Italian Fascist Government in its endeavour to strengthen Islam. His Excellency the Duce, Benito wlussolini, loves Moslems and orientals and he has a sincere desire to lift them up.'‘Corriere dell 1 Impero’* No,49, 25/4/37 !• ITALY AND ISLAM (5y Mohamed Yussuf). The risit of the Duce to Lyhia and his speeches there have heen greatly appreciated hy the Muhammadens in the Empire, because they see a new direction in Italian sovereignty and the noble principles behind the Government’s attitude towards her Muhammaden subjects. The comportable and tranquil life now enjoyed by natives, as opposed to their previous state, as well as the real prosperity, are proof enough of Italy’s fulfilment of her intentions. Taking into consideration the present state of affairs, • one can say that such a thing has never previously been known in colonial history. There are countries which have been under European colonisation for many years but which still know nothing of peace and quiet because the instruments of these Governments are force and roughness which shock the native feelings and weaken their customs and traditions by introducing among them a foreign nation as it is the case now in Palestine. But the basis of Italian colonisation in Ethiopia is an understanding of the people’s desires and wants, the protection of their rights and compliance with their requests. In this way Italy has in a very short time won the hearts of the natives, their fidelity and devotion/ P 7 ) *&gt;3 British imbaesy 459. 2btil May, 1957 Sir I have the honour to report that lately various messages from Palestine to Italian newspapers have drawn attention to the growing sympatuy of the alestinian Arabs for the luce, A Jerusalem message published in tne 'Messersrero' of May 22nd reported that two great photographs of Mussolini and hitler were die layed on tue principal Arab buildings in the centre of the town, and the fact wae described as 'an 'eloquent manifestation of the feelings of the Arab community 'of Palestine'. (May 26th; that the Palestine press had called attention to the display of Italian and German flags together with the Arab flags and with photographs of the Duce and hitler, and to the 'total absence of British flags. The same correspondent said it was interesting and also 'touching' to take note of the sympathy with whicu the Arab press in Palestine continued to occupy itself with Italy*s pro-Ielamic policy, sole nly proclaimed by the Duce in the course of his Journey to Libya. Extracts were given from the most significant comments on Count Ciano’s recent statement on Italian foreign policy. The 'Falastin' of Jeffa, the 'Adclifaa” and tne 'Glamia al Islamia' were quoted. 2.

For tue first time the solemn ceremonies were broadcast. The Mufti of Jerusalem nad a triumphal day. He was acclaimed in the streets with great enthusiasm. Hear the Jaffa Gate, a cafe facing the Tover of David displayed pictures of King Gnazi of Iraq, 'tne son and 'political heir of Feysal, the impassioned upholder of tne indepen- 'dence and unity of ills co—religionists', of Mussolini on the right, and of hitler on the left. The whole mlse e n s cene nad a manifest political significance. It was intended 'to emphasize 'publicly the bitter rancour of tne autochtnonous po dilation of tue 'Holy Land against the Mandatory Povrer'. Ho one, the correspondent added, made a secret of this polemical aim. It was explicitly confirmed by an Arab cnief who, pointing to the photographs of Mussolini and Hitler, was reported to nave made the following statement to the correspondent: 'We admire with a feeling of sincere 'enthusiasm the head of Fascism for his humane comprehension, his 'sympathy tovards Islam, and his cour ge for having dared to rise 'before anybody else against the myth of British mignt. e entertain 'the same feelings of esteem and affection towards tne Chancellor 'of the Keicn for his benevolent attitude towards our national cause 'and for the firm audacity with which he has exploded tne old 'legend of the invincible force of the Jews. How we also in 'Palestine are struggling against these two myths wnioh are both 'personified in the policy of the mandatory Power.' 4.

Signor idissolini made a speech at Tripoli yesterday evening on the occasion of oresentation to him of 'sword of Islam'. Two versions of this speech have been issued by Stefani agency but they differ only in trifling details of style. Signor Lius sol ini apparently began by saying rhat he had been sent by the King of Italy to examine the needs of Libya and to meet their legitimre desires. The sword which was offered to him was a symbol of force and justice and would be one of the happiest memories of his life. He went on to say that a new period was opening in the history of Libya where people had given proof of loyalty to Italy by maintaining perfect order while Italy was engaged in a distant war and offering thousands of volunteers who contributed greatly to the victory; the warriors who had fought in Ethiopia would return in the course of the summer. 'In the face of such proof FascisH Italy intend to assure to the Moslem populations of Libya and Ethiopia peace, justice, well-being and respect for the laws of the prophet and wishes furthermore to show her sympathy for Islam and Moslems of the whole world'. He concluded by saying that he was a man sparing of promises but that what he promised he fulfilled.P.Z.2135/1937. KH^loaur foreign Office covering note No.E.1636/201/25, Dated 25th March, 1937. No. 30 (295/369/4) British Legation, jedda 2nd March 1937 Sir, In the Jedda Report for December which I had the honour to transmit to you with my despatch No.334 dated December 31st, there was a paragraph about the imminent arrival of nearly 2,000 Ethiopian pilgrims whose pilgrimage was to be 'facilitated” by the Italian Government. I quote the paragraph here so that it can be compared easily with * 2 the attached newspaper extract which seems to refer to the assisted pilgrimage in question: '425. A report that the Italian Minister had informed the Saudi authorities that the journey of a large number of pilgrims from Ethiopia would be facilitated by the Italian Government this season was regarded with some scepticism by the Legation, because of the expenditure of foreign currency which such a project would involve and the consequent derogation from the Italian regulations in lorce in Ethiopia. However, the T, Saut-al-Hejaz' now reports that 1,900 Ethiopian pilgrims are coming to Mecca this season and that the Government of Italy are affording all facilities.' 2. It is difficult to make a coherent story out of the items oi information which are at our disposal. The Hejaz was promised, in a telegram from Addis Ababa which appeared in the 'Saut-al-Hejaz' and can only have come from or with the approval of the Italian authorities, 1,900 Ethiopian pilgrims. The ligures lurnished by the Jedda Passport Office show 610 pilgrims as having come from Ethiopia and none from Eritrea, but any Eritreans who came may perhaps have been classed with Somalis The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.,M.P., etc., etc., etc. or/£ © % a. or Takrunis (West Africans) who arrived on the same vessels. And now the attached newspaper report refers to ,! about a thousand pilgrims from Eritrea' as arriving on one ship with the assistance of their Government. My concxusion is that the Saudi authorities, not being able to refuse altogether to print this gross Italian propaganda, have so treated it as to deprive it of much of its value and even to make it slightly ridiculous. The Masawwan chosen to blow the Italian trumpet is reported at length as to his subscriptions to various Saudi societies and institutions and also as to his alleged gratitude for the conditions he found in the Hejaz, but the Italian assistance receives scurvy treatment. There is no mention of Ethiopia, nor of the Italian Government. An Eritrean pilgrim is quoted as saying that 'the government of his country' had assisted 'about a thousand pilgrims from Eritrea' to the point of giving them each Frs.10,000. And then comes the devastating comment: 'His Excellency expatiated on this theme'. The concluding phrase, 'we give His Excellency a hearty welcome' is common form in Hejaz newspaper reports, or one might suspect that the welcome was addressed in irony to His Excellency f s easily-acquired funus. 3. The Umm al Qura published a week later than the one in which the attached extract appeared gives nearly a column to another effort by Italian propaganda to burst into prominence, but here too there seems to be evidence of Saudi repression. The effort consists of a statement which this same Muhammad Hassan of Masawwa is alleged to have made to the T imm al Qura. As to five sixths it consists of praises c£ what he saw in the Hejaz and fulsome thanks to the King for receiving him, and as to the remaining sixth of a paragraph which runs: 'In company with Muhammad Bey Nur, Naio of Masawwa, 1 visited His Excellency the Minister of Finance, and presented to him for transmission to H.M.the King the congratulations of General Gi o s an!(?ll Governoi of the colony of Eritrea, on the occasion of I the festival. 1 met with indescribable kindness from His Excellency.' Arl/3. All this suggests that Ibn Saud refused to hear anything about Italy and Ethiopia, which would have raised the awkward question of recognition of the Italian 'Einpire”, and compromised by allowing his Minister of Finance, who is also in charge of pilgrim affairs, to receive congratulations from the Governor of Eritrea, I shall perhaps hear what actually happened when His Majesty comes to Jectda, where he is expected about a week hence, 4. Some weeks ago Fuad Bey asked me whether I had seen the report that pilgrims were to come from Ethiopia and were to receive facilities from the Italian Government. I said that 1 had, and that in view of the severe restrictions on the export of currency from Ethiopia it would obviously require the grant of facilities, or rather the removal of obstacles, before any of the inhabitants could bring any money out of the country for the pilgrimage or any other purpose. It seemed to me that Fuad Bey was glad to hear even this lefthanded argument in favour of the Italians and took mental note of it for future use, but this impression may be due to the suspicion that all Italian propaganda arouses and to the belief which was widespread here at the time of the Ethiopian dispute th ;.t Fuad Bey was under Italian influence. 5. Some pilgrims certainly came from Ethiopia and some of them are even known to have spoken in praise of Italy, but any effect this propaganda might have had will surely be counteracted in the Hejaz by the claim that Eritrean pilgrims were given Frs.10,000 a head by the Eritrean authorities, flhat effect the Italian assistance will have upon the pilgrims themselves or upon their iellow Moslems in Italian East Africa I am not competent to say, but I cannot think that it will have impressed either Ibn Saud or his people. a foreign power that recently published in Jedda a notice which admitted by implication the depreciation in value of its own banknotes does/@&gt;&lt;?2 4. does not. spend Fr*10,000 a head (or whatever sum it did spend) on shipping a batch of pilgrims to Mecca merely to earn a nights repose by the consciousness of something doie , and no Saudi will ever think it did. 6.

BULLARD.Translation from the ,, Umm-al-Q,ura M of February 22nd, 1937. »There recently arrived at Mecca one of the notables of Massawa, Hassan Bey Muhammad Salim Batuq, with a party of Eritrean Moslems about 50 in number. He visited the offices of this newspaper, and also many benevolent institutions, and contributed £2. gold each to the Aviation Society, the Asylum for Orphans and the Aged and the Charitable Society, and £l gold to the Piastre Scheme. We give him our thanks and hope that his pilgrimage will be blessed. Hassan Bey informed us that there came with him on the same ship about a thousand pilgrims from Eritrea. He spoke of his feelings about what he had seen c£ the progress and prosperity in this country and the attention paid to the comfort of pilgrims, and begged us to transmit his thanks for this to the Government of His Majesty the King. He also informed us that the government of his country had interested themselves in assisting pilgrims from Eritrea and made every facility for them, to the point of giving each of them material help to the extent o£ Frs.10,000.

Drummond (Rome). D. 20th March, 1907. R. 23rd March, 1937. 9.20 p.m. No. 52. (Saving). The press insists on the clarity, loyalty and enlightened character of Italy's ’’Moslem policy”. Commenting on Signor Mussolini's speech to the Moslems of Tripoli and Libya, once more disclaims any threat to the interests of other nations. ^’Interested agents” had suggested that Italian policy was directed towards ”uncontainable and menacing expansions”, and had thus attempted to sow distrust between Italy and the Moslem populations, whereas geographical historical reasons and economic and cultural interests pointed towards a natural collaboration in the Mediterranean. Friendship between Italy and the Moslem populations was no menace to the interests of any other nation, but was ”a powerful element of* order in the Lastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea . The policy displayed by the Duce created among the Moslem nations ’'the natural sequel and spiritual amplification of the Gentleman's ngr enent which assures as far as Italy is concerned the intangibii 1 oy of all the interests and all the States in the Mediterranean. ’ Other editorials are equally reassuring as to Italy's real intentions and resentful of the suggestions that she has any others. On the other hand, messages from Libya are flamboyant and pretentious in their claims. A despatch to the ”Resto del Carlino” from Rome, says that the Luce's words will reach the ears of the faithful throughout ’’Mediterranean Africa, Asia from the Bosphorus to the Persian Gulf, and farther still to India, China and Australia (sic.)” A message to the same paper from Tripoli mentions the great imnression2 . 10 ' 2 - impression made upon the 'Egyptian, Palestinian, Syrian and Tunisian notables' who had come to Libya for the occasion. One of these guests had assured the correspondent that Tripoli might become a great religious centre for all Islam, now that the powers of the Caliphate had come to an end, for only in Tripoli were to be found 'the political tranquillity, the absolute respect towards Moslem laws and the other elements which might assure the peaceful development of Islamic studies and thought.' A telegram to the 'Messaggero' said it was quite clear why Mussolini was the 'Protector of Islam'. Only the bad faith of Italy's obstinate enemies could attempt to hide the reason by 'smokescreens of malign inventions and low speculations.' 'Protector of Islam in the moral and also the political sense is certainly the Head of Fascist Italy, for the consciousness of his incomparable power and of his universal prestige and of his luminous sense of humanity and justice lead him to raise the peoples living under the tricolour in the climate of our own civilisation , while respecting all their laws, customs etc., ana assuring their moral and material well-being. Italy had no profiteering mandates to exploit to the detriment of the Moslem populations nor did she rely on other peoples as instruments to oppress the Moslems and hold them in a state of cruel slavery.dexeb r In any farther communication on this subject, p e No. Pflg^O and address — not to any persor^ by name, bu to- - “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. ease quote ■ s-x. .v Jr THE Under-Secretary of State foiC Foreign Affairs presents his t '&gt; r *«' U ZJ M \&lt;* R. . compliments to ^ ‘ y and, by direction of the Secretary of State r transmits herewith cop kjl*, of the under-mentioned paper.

This evening's papers publish report of a speech made by oignor Mussolini at inauguration of Tripoli Exhibition, He recalled his previous visit to Libya and said that Libya was now completely pacified as was proved by spontaneous and enthusiastic demonstrations given by Moslem population haring the last few days. He said that the policy of Rome had been prudently and methodically carried out by all governors and he paid particular tribute to the activities of Marshal Balbo. Moslem populations knew that under the Italian flag they would have peace and well-being and thal their customs and above all their religious beliefs would be scrupulously respected. In 1926 he had visited Libya to give what had been called a shake-up to the colony. Results were visible to all eyes both in the cities and in the fields. Italian country labourers were awakening a land which had slept for centuries. This work: of trans formation had been crowned by the great coast road, an enterprise which only Italian engineers and Italian v/orkmen could have brought to conclusion in such a brief time. This road was a cause of pride for Italy but it ought to and must be a similar cause for pride for all those Europeans worthy of the name which was once at least a great name. Signor Mussolini went on to say: M Italian engineers and workmen toiled during seasons in which the climatic conditions were infinitely less pretty than those usualusual on Lake Leman where the most numerous and powerful coalitions attempted in vain to suffocate Italy. If there is anyone who thinks all that has oeen forgotten (shouts of M No' from the crowd) let him undeceive himself; I have not forgotten. 'And now let me deplore in the most explicit manner the alarmist campaign which in various countries, above all in the more or less great so-called democracy, has been staged in regard to my journey to Libya. This continual neuropathic state of alarm at this sowing of panic and suspicion certainly does not serve the cause of peace because it profoundly disturbs the atmosphere between peoples. This journey is imperialist in the sense that virile peoples have always given, still give, and will give to this word. But it has no recondite designs or aggressiv aims against anyone whatsoever. 7/ithin the Mediterranean and without it we desire to live in peace with all and we offer our collaboration to those who display similar wish. 7e are arming ourselves on the sea, in the sky, and on land because this is our imperative duty in face of amaments of others; but the Italian people demands to be left in peace because it is bent upon a long and difficult tasn. In commenting on the speech Dr. Gayda says the policy indicated in it finds its concrete confirmation m recent diplomatic acts, in gentlemen’s agreement in the t Mediterranean, and in ansv/er given by Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs to British note on reconstitution oi Locarno Pact. Agreement for Mediterranean signified that Italy recognised and pledged herself not to couch the rights, interests^, and status ° r J^e Meaiterraneeii Powers of Europe In substance Italy against political blocs Italian reply to Locarno note confirmed Western Pact. on defending unity of the great which had been cemented in 1925 once more declared that she was _ which were being formed amongst the Powers./ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned R. 9.30 a.m. 18th March, 1937.

Sir I have the honour to transmit to you, with reference to my despatch No. 274 of the 22nd December the accompanying copy of a despatch from the acting British Consul at ITarar, N o. 86 of the 29th December last, in which Mr f ,7ikeloy reports on Italian propaganda among Moslems in his district. of (General Nssi»s speech was his expression of Italy's Intention that Karar should '’become once again a great Moslem centre, a centre upon which converge the thoughts and affection of the whole Jloslem world’*. Italian propaganda among Moslems living within the bounds of Ethiopia will depend largely on the measure of freedom in commercial pursuits which the new masters of the cotintry allow to the Hararls, Yemenis, Hadramautis and Indians on whom they are lavishing their verbal blandishments. My experience here enables me, likewise, to endorse his views as regards the unfavourable impression created by Italian methods of handling the local Moslem communities. Both Messrs G.M. Mohamedally &amp; Company, the leading Indian Moslem firm, and the two leading British- protected Arab traders, have complained to me of the attitude adopted towards them by the Italian officials 2 I have omitted the two enclosures referred to in the first paragraph of the report. The main point 3 I agree with Mr ^ikeley that the success of / with The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc • etc etc etc(2) with whom they come in contact. In a private letter to Marshal Graziani dated the IGth December last I urged that subordinate authorities should be urged to display greater consideration In their treatment of this old-established and respectable firm; and at my parting interview with Marshal Graziani on the 6th January I mad© orally a similar appeal on behalf of the Arabs. The Marshal promised to see to the latter matter on his return from the Journey which he has now undertaken. 4.

(GOMEL DSIITIAL) KARAR. 1002 20th December 1936. 1957 j Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a speech addressed by a Moslem notefi&amp;le of Hafar to General Nasi on the occasion of the Id-al-Fitr at the enc of Ramadan. I also enclose a translation of the General's reply. The text of both speeches was published in the Corriero Harrarino of 19th December wherein also appeared the announcoment that an unspecified grade in the Order of the Colonial Star had been bestowed upon the Kadi of Harar, Yunis Addus, and upon two other Moslem notabluc, Sheikh Ahmad al Asad and Katib Hussein, 2. Since my arrival here I have been closoly watching the effects of Italian Moslem propaganda upon the population of Harar. The conclusion I have arrived at up to date is that, while at first the Moslems of Kafar v/olcoined the arrival of the Italians, they have since been greatly disillusioned. This conclusion, which is shared by my French colleague, is based on many small factors such as discreet conversation with ?Ioslem British subjects and remarks overheard here and there. Whenever I go to Dire Dawa my chauffour is besieged with requests to obtain British passports for Moslems who either wish to leave the country or desire to obtain British protection. There has been a small exodus of Moslem traders, British subjects included, who find life impossible under the present regime. I am told that even Sufian ibn Abdullah, the so-called / 'Sultan” His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, British Legation, Addis Ababa.(2) 'Sultan' of Harar (see your despatch to the Secretary of State No. 236 of 9th November) v/ho appears to have received exceptional favours from the Italians, would . i* leave the country immediatoly if he coulcW 3. Although none of thooe pieces of evidence is of great importanco in itself, they do, I consider, constitute, if taken as a v/hole, fairly conclusive proof that, in spite of distribution of gifts and much speechifying, Italian propaganda among the Moslems of tnis. dxs rict has not made much headway. 4. The reason for this seems to me to be a double one viz (a) Italian lack of understanding of Moslem religious principles, and (b) the restrictive commercial policy pursued by the Italians since their arrival. Unaer the ^irst head may be placed such acts as 'inviting” the iioslem population to celebrate tho Id-al-Fitr prayers in the courtyard of the Governor T s palace in tns P res0riCQ a of non-I.Iosleme; another such action, .vhich seems to have aroused resentmenttook place wnen the Italian Minister for the Colonies, Signore Lessona, entered the principal Mosque (without, so far as I can ascertain, removing his shoes) and the Kadi had to make a speech of welcome. in this connexion must also be mentioned the manner in which Italian soldiers and subordinate officials treat native //omen. Most of them have absolutelv no restraint in this respect and they do not take the trouble to ascertain whether the woman concerned is respectable or not. A scandalous case recently came to my notice: The Italian officials on the Franco-Ethiopian frontier on the railway discovered a new form of amusement, that of personally undressing, nominally in order to search them, the native women who travelled on the railway. / TheThe case of Wazir All Baig's wife (see ray despatch i'!o• 79) was not an isolated caso; all native women were for a time subjected to this treatment. I am told that this has now been stopped, but the harm has been done and the tolo will be spread abroad among Hos?.ems, who, of all people, are most rosontful of any interference with their womenfolk. 5. Under the second hoad (b) are to be onumoratod all those economic and financial measures which have brought the trade of Harar, Dire Dawa and Jijiga almost to a standstill (see my despatches Nos. 63 S and 69 E). The Harari Moslem has developed the commercial instinct to a very high degree, so that any interference with his commercial activities is bound to arouso great resentment. 6. In addition to these two main reasons for the failure of Italian Moslem propaganda in Harar may be mentioned the extremely arbitrary manner in which the Italian official, especially the subordins.tc one, treats the populations he administers. I was once in the office of the assistant to the Resident at Dire Dawa while he was dispensing summary ”justice' 1 . Several natives, the majority of whom v/cro Moslems, appeared before him, having been denounced by the Carabinieri for small sins of commicsion or omission. They were all condemned to pay what were, for thorn, large fines, without having a chance to speak in their own defence, and without che Carabiniere in question having put in an appearance at all. The official concerned sat beneath a motto which ran u La Legge e ugale per tutti'. I was so enraged that I nearly left the room, so it is easy to imagine what the wretched victims felt.Ill (4) 7. There is, of course, another aspect of the problem, and an important one, viz the effect that Italian ^ propaganda is having upon Moslem populations outside Ethiopia. As stated above, the Italians, in spite of appearances, have not had much success locally, but the reaons for this do not apply abroad, and it mpy y/oll be that the Moslems in Egypt, Arabia, Syria and India, who have no opportunity to compare Italian speochos v/ith Italian acts, have been misled by Italian propaganda. I venture to predict, however, that when all the tale is told and Moslem travellers from Ethiopia have had time to revoal the truth to their co-religionists in dther countries, the innate viciousness of Italian Colonial policy will moro than countorbalance any effects their propaganda may have had in the Moslem world.

Though I see no rea on to doubt that it in Intended to devote especial attention to the education of the young on Fascist linos, or that the principle of influencing minds whilst still impressionable will, as usual, give excellent results, I regret that my enquiries are far from confirming the somewhat optimistic forecast made in that despatch. I now have the honour* to transmit a statement, based on inaterial supplied by an Ethiopian working in one of the Italian schools, whS.ch presents a most lamentable picture. For purposes of comparison I also enclose a statement shewing the Ethiopian schools which were open previously to the Italian occupation, all of which are now closed. In addition there are the Mission schools, which are, so far as I am aware, still in being. So far, therefore, it cannot be said that the advent of the Italian regime has improved the educational facilities open / to The Bight Honourable Anthony Eden ?

Roberts* despatch Ho. 273 of 22nd Dec. 1936 The ao-callet; Fascist schools In Addis Ababe are not schools In reality, but have bean established for propaganda purposes, as the following facts will explain:- v At the time when the 'Scuola del Littorio' for adults was opened by the w Fascio di Combatt linen to di Addis Abeba' come 2500 men were accepted and registered. The reason why so many men registered themselves in the school at once was to ©scape imprisonment for minor offences and evade compulsory enlistment for military services. But after a month or two they were forced to go to the various military quarters to be trained as soldiers, or as auxiliaries to the carabineers. Those who were trained as soldiers were sent to various places to fi^ht, and those wh^Yere trained as auxiliaries to the carabineers were employed as traffic police and can be seen on the streets with red bands around their waist and across their shoulders. There are at present 150 boys in the school, who are only given oral lessons from time to time. No books etc. are supplied. No regular attendance is made by the boys. The following was the programme for the school, but it is not carried out:- P. N. F. Fascio di Combattlmento di Addis Ababa. Souola dal Littorio. .......

Progressive counting, idea of the four operations oral and written. (3) Physical Education . First elements of drill and military gymnastics. (4) Rules of Conduct and Hygiene . First elements of civil education : Respect towards persons, property and constituted authorities. No attention is paid to the progress of the school* It is left in the hands of a few »itreen teachers* The work of the school is described as childish. It is only on occasions when visitors go to the school that Italian teachers are present. The 'Scuola del Littorio ,? for children, or ’’Balilla” school, is run in the seme manner as the above school. The only difference is that food and clothing are supplied in the Balilla school. The boys are also supplied with blankets and beds. There were about 300 boys at first, but the number has now decreased to 150, the reaeon being that some of them died of typhus and others had to leave the school owing to starvation. It is said that the food given daily is scanty and unsuitable, and it is only the boys who have no place to go to that stay in the school. Time Is spent in singing the National hymn of Italy, and 'OiovinefcKa', and in training of a military nature. It Is understood that the only school where Italian is taught is the Conaolata Mission school. A number of Ethiopians are attending evening classes. The Tafari Hekonnsn school has been reserved for the future use of Italian children. A new director of colonial schools has recently arrived / here(3) here from Rome and ia busy in drawing up a new programme, a copy of which it is hoped to obtain in dua course. The schools which wore hitherto in the hands of the Fascist Federation are being taken over by the Government shortly. The Italian authorities, in order to keep occupied with something the minds of the Ethiopian officials and employees of the various Ministries and departments, who, some time a^o, were granted a sum of 40 per cant of their respective salaries for two mouths (para, (o) of the enclosure to Addis Ababa despatch No. 226 of the 27th October), have ordered them to learn Italian as from next week. They are to attend school once a week. The school at the Armenian church v/hich used to be the Balilla school is being used for the purpose. It is, &amp;owover, for various reasons doubtful whether more than a small percentage of these officials and employees will in fact attend the school.iaiolosure No* 2 to Mr P*M.

Sir, I have the honour to report, with reference to despatch Ho. 230 of the 3rd November last, that. In pursuance of the policy of conciliating the Mohammedan element in Ethiopia, the celebration of the feast which closes the month of Ramazan took place in a solemn and public manner which has not hitherto been cizstomary in Addis Ababa. 2. By order of Marshal Grazlani, the close of the fast at siuiset on the 14th December was marked by the firing of fourteen guns. (In the press report it is implied that this was not done under the Ethiopian regime; in point of fact, however, guns used to be fired but there were no official celebrations such as are reported below). Next day the Moslems, including, it is stated, notables from the Hadramaut, the Yemen, Aden and India, assembled in an open space near the station, and the Qadl, In leading the prayers, invoked the blessing of Ood upon King Victor Emmanuel, Signor Mussolini and Marshal Oraziani, the last-named being described as the w plllar of Islam”. They then betook themaelvos to the office of the Governor of Addis Ababa, to whom the notables paid their respects. Marshal Graziani also arrived at the Governor’s office in order to participate in the ceremony. The Qadl delivered a fulsome oration, in the course of which he expressed the certitude that Italy would never interfere in the religious / affairs • # The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M*Paffairs of Moslems and would always remain equally tolerant and tendered an expression of gratitude to King Victor Bnnanuel and Signor Mussolini, and also to Marshal Graziani who had done for the Moslems of Ethiopia what no one else had* Addressing the Mohammedans of the whole world, he voiced the hope that they might all find themselves in the same state of liberty and justice as that asnured by the Italian tricolour. 3* In his reply Marshal Graziani expressed to tihose present his good wishes on the occasion of the feast, and renewed the assurance of benevolent treatment of Moslems In Ethiopia, whom the Government considered as their right hand. The Mohammedans of Gore had, he mentioned, asked for a mosque, and their desire would be fulfilled. In conclusion he handed to the Qadi a warrant appointing him a Cavaliere of the Order of the Star of Italy, 4. It is probably needless to observe that these protestations of devotion were by no means as spontaneous as they were intended to appear. The head of the British Indian community, who considered it expedient not to abstain from the official part of the celebration, informed me that, while he had agreed to join in an expression of satisfaction with the treatment extended to local Moslems by Italy, he had refused to associate himself with the proposed inclusion of a statement that they had been ill- treated under the Ethiopian Government. 5. It is reported that similar celebrations took place in other centres, and especially at Barar, where the custom, interrupted during the Ethiopian regime, was thus renewed. In the course of a speech the Governor confirmed the intention of the Italian Government that Harar should&gt;3| rv (3) one© moi’© be one of the moat flourishing centres of Islam. 6. I am sending copie^6f this despatch to the Government of India, to the Governor General of the Anglo- Egyptian Sudan, to the Governors of Kenya Colony and of the Somaliland Protectorate, to His Majesty’s High Contnlssloners at Cairo and at Jerusalem, to the Chief Commissioner at Aden to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Homo and at Bagdad, and to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda.

Italian anti-British propaganda in the Middle East. 7. T then spoke of anti-British propaganda in the Middle East and hegged that he would give this matter his (? grp. omtd)est possible attention since my government attached the greatest importance to it. To continue, I said, such propaganda would not be at all in accordance with friendly relations which we now hoped to induce. We heard from various sources that Italian propagandists were endeavouring to persuade Arabs generally that Italy treated and would treat them better than Great Britain, thus stirring up disaffection. His Excellency took note of the point and said that he would give it serious attention. He remarked however that he had been into the case of the two men whose names I had previously mentioned, namely Shekib Arslan and Ihsan El Jabi. He had instituted a very careful enquiry which had resulted in statement being sent to the police that neither of these two men had been in Italy for the last year and a quarter. I said this was contrary to my information but he remarked that if he had not been convinced of the truth of what he said he would not have replied as he had done but would have left the matter in abeyance. He sent for the official who had been in charge of the enquiry in order that he should explain matters to me but unfortunately he was away for a day or two. In my view the main difficulty here lies in the fact that if Count Ciano gave us any assurance that propaganda would cease it would constitute admission on his part that it had existed, whichwhich so far he has denied. Nevertheless I think we can obtain in practice a change and a cessation at least to a considerable extent of these activities.COPY.

You should therefore revert to the question and insist that Count Ciano should give the matter his serious attention. In this connexion I would call your attention to the paragraph in my draft declaration regarding activities likely to impair good relations. This paragraph is intended to apply more particularly to unfriendly propaganda, and you can explain this to Count Ciano if you think it necessary. Put I would not consider it satisfactory if this clause in the declaration was not at some stage supplemented by a direct assurance from Count Ciano and by some tangible evidence of a change of policy on the part of the Italian authorities. In this respect we must not of course be fobbed off by any request for a statement of our evidence. It would be for obvious reasons impossible to quote most of it. Nor by quoting specific instances should we wish to be laid open to the interpretation that those were all that we had to complain of or that other localities were not equally affected. The complaint is in fact general, and the propaganda would not of course be going on without official connivance and material support. The Italian Government must therefore necessarily know all about it.EXTRACT FRO:..

This man, who knows Arabic and the Italian North African possessions, appears to have succeeded Signor Scarpa, who is now in Odessa, as a go-between of the Italian Government for Orientals. It seems that Arslan may be sent to India to try to persuade the Moslems there that Italy will free their brother Moslems in the Mediterranean from British domination. His task, if he goes, will also include persuading them that Italy is giving more to the Moslems in Abyssinia, Tripoli, nritrea and Italian Somaliland than the British in their Moslem territories. Later . I now learn that the idea of sending Arslan to Sudan has been temporarily abandoned. He is now in Naples on the v/ay to Tripoli, where he will carry out propaganda among the Moslems in favour of Fascism. There is apparently some notion of sending him later to Abyssinia. * fv. &gt; COPY. (E 7644^617/91) IBN SAU1 AII-J ITALIAN AI/IBITIONS IN ARABIA. The Saudi Minister came to see me this evening and Brought a very long confidential despatch in Arabic which he had just received from King Ibn baud. M. 2ada gave me the substance of the despatch as follows. But he seemed to find unusual difficulty in translating it and in making the points in it clear. £. As His Majesty’s Government would have observed, Ibn Sauu had recently been consulting them more and more frequently on questions of foreign policy. This was because (1) he considered that the true interests of Arabia lay in friendship with Great Britain, (2) because he wanted to align his policy as far as possible with that of His Majesty’s Government, and ( 6 ) because he wished to do nothing which might cause His Majesty's Government embarrassment. But he appreciated that the questions which he asked them from time to time might also be embarrassing to them and he v/ished to know first of all whether His Majesty's Government welcomed this attitude cn his part, or would prefer that he did not consult them so often. 6 . The despatch went on in this strain for some time, and then explained that Ibn Saud was very uneasy about the situation in various parts of Arabia, and in particular in the Yemen and in Iraq. Much propaganda was being carried on against His rlajesty's Government, who were being repre sented as the enemies of the Arabs, who- were being incited to adopt a hostile attitude towards them in consequence. ThisThis propaganda had 'been carried on hy the agents cf four Powers in particular, viz., Italy, the Scviet Unicn, Germany and Turkey. 4. On my cross-quer.tioning the i.iinister as to precisely what all this meant, it turned out that what it all 'boiled down to was that Ibn Saud was very uneasy about Italian propaganda in Arabia in general and about Italian intentions in the Yemen in particular. Ibn Saud explained that Italian agents were being particularly active in the Yemen, where they were, by bribes and propaganda, under mining the_influence of the Imam. This might lead to the fall of the Imam, or in any case to the development of an extremely dangerous situation if the Imam should for any reason disappear. Ibn Saud was anxious, if possible, to come to some u' erstanding with His Majesty's Government about the situation. 5. I waited until the whole of this document had been explained before replying. I then began by repeating, v/hat I had often said before, that His Majesty's Government fully appreciated and reciprocated Ibn Saud's friendly feelings towards them, and appreciated in particular the way in which he wished to avoid any conflict of policy with them and from time, to time consulted them on political questions with this object in view. There was certainly no reason why I i Saud should not continue to keep in touch with His Mjesty's Government on questions cf policy, and His Majesty's Government would always be glad to answer any questions he might ask them, whenever it was possible for them to do so. 6 . As regards anti-British propaganda, the four countries which Ibn baud haa named as being responsiblefor it were in rather different categories. I v/as surprised to hear the 'lurks mentioned, as cur relations with Turkey had recently been particularly friendly. At this the ilinister explained that Ihn Gaud was no doubt thinking of the past. I said that if this was so, it was no good raking it up, but that I found it rather difficult to believe that the Turks were really carrying on any anti-British propaganda now. As regards Germany, she was of course keenly trying to develop and expand her commerce in the Middle East; while Soviet Russia was, by the nature of things, bound to carry on propaganda everywhere in favour cf her political ideas; but it would be useful to know whether Ibn Saud had any special cases in mind. In reply to this, the Minister admitted that the only propaganda abmt which Ibn Saud was seriously worried was that of Italy. He did not seem inclined to follow up any cf the other suggestions, which may have been mere window- dressing . 7 . I said that it was of course well known that Italy had been carrying on a great deal of active propaganda all through the Middle East. We were well aware that this had rften been violently anti-British - e.g. the broadcasts from Bari, etc., v/hich were well known. Moreover it v/as clear that a good deal cf Italian money had at one time or another been spent in such propaganda activities. In so far as they might be carried on in Saudi Arabia itself, only King Ibn Saud himself could deal with them. As regards such activities elsewhere, it would be useful to know whether Ibn Saud could give us any further details, and whether he had any definite suggestions to make. 8 . The Minister replied that Ibn Saud had no definite proposals, but merely wished to bring uhe fac^s to cur attention, particularly with regard to Italian intrigues in the Yemen. As regards Italian intrigues in Saudi ArabiaArabia, he would he very grateful for any information we could give him. I said that this might he difficult, since one might know that propaganda was going on and money toeing spent, when it was nevertheless not possible to Quote chapter and verse. Vith regard to Ihn Saud’s suggestion that we should, reach some understanding with Ihn Saud with regard to possible Italian activities in the Yemen, I explained that the position was that His Majesty’s Government desired to see Saudi Arabia strong and independent, and to see the iniepen- dence of the Yemen equally maintained. This principle underlay the Anglo-Italian Understanding cf 1927, the substance of which had already been communicated to Ibn Saud, by which Great Britain and Italy recognised their mutual interest in seeing the independence of the Arab kingdoms maintained, and mutually renounced any intention cf establishing themselves on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. Italy was thus bound by an understanding with His Majesty’s Government not to establish herself in the Yemen, and she would hardly be likely to violate that understanding unless as part of some major dispute, which would turn not on local Arabian but on major European political issues. Whatever one might think of the value of Italian promises ^regarding which one mi^ht well be sceptical - there could clearly be no question cf His Majesty’s Government reaching an understanding with Ibn Saud which would be based on the assumption that a friendly European Power was about to violate an undertaking which it had assumed towards this country. 9. The Minister, after some conversation in Arabic with M. Zada, replied that Ibn Saud did not mean an understanding of this kind, but that he merely wished His Majesty’s Government to know that they could rely on him to support them in the event «f Italy attempting any adventure in the Yemen in viclation of her undertakings. I said that I would record what the Minister had said and submit it for considerationcrnsi derat ion, 'but I made it clear that, while we fully appreciated Ihn Gaud s attitude towards us and the dangers of the situation ir the Yemen, we could not proceed on any assump tion thai Italy would disregard the Rome Understanding. 10. The Minister then reverted to the question of Italian propaganda in Iraq, 'but admitted that King I bn Gaud had nothing to go on and was merely puzzled and disturbed by what had recently happened in that country. 11. The upshot cf a long and somewhat confusing conversation seemed to be that Tbn Baud wished for some kind of assurance that we did not regard him as a nuisance; wished to warn us of Italian activities in the Yemen and of the danger threatening from that quarter, which would be greater to him even than to us; and seemed tc hope to obtain from us some kind of undertaking to join with him in resisting any Italian attack cn the Yemen, a suggestion which the Minister abandoned as soon as I indicated some of the obvious objections to it.

Sir, I have the honour to report, with reference to my t despatch No.207 of the 29th September last, that Mohammedan notables have been prominently represented at the receptions which have been held during the visit of the Italian Ministers of the Colonies and of Public Works. Some account of these receptions and of the speeches delivered at them will be found below. 2. On the 11th October Marshal Graziani met a gathering of some thousand Moslems, stated to be chiefly notables representing the Mohammedan communities of Addis Ababa, Eritrea, Italian Somaliland, Harar, Jimma, Kaffa and Wallega, as also representatives of the Yemen and of 'the Arab zone facing Aden'. The Marshal informed them that he considered them all, from whatever region they might come, as members of that great and glorious Islam, for which Italy entertained great respect. He added that with the end of the rainy season the construction of the new mosque and of Mohammedan Schools in Addis Ababa would at once be taken in hand. A reply was made by a certain Sheikh Isa el Katbari, or by his representative Sheikh Serur on his behalf; Sheikh Isa el Katbari is apparently a spokesman of the Gurage tribe, the traditional hewers of wood and drawers of water of the Addis Ababa neighbourhood. He contrasted the neglected and humiliated state of the Moslems under Ethiopian rule with the Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.» M.P., etc., etc ., etc •}5&amp; with the benefits brought to them by Italy, and acclaimed the Marshal as the 'man of Islam'. Other replies were made by Ahmed ibn Abdullah, who has been appointed Chief Qadi in Addis Ababa, by two Tigreans named Saiyid Abdurrahman Mohammed Sherif and Sheikh Mohammed Kemal Massawi, by Aba i « Jobir the grandson of Aba Jifar the last ruler of Jimma, by Mohammed Yusuf of Harar, a small merchant of poor reputation, by Hajji Brass©, an Arab and principal servant of Messrs. G.M. Mohamedally and Company, and by Sheik Omer Ibrahim, a 'negadi' (caravan-leader) and formerly a Legation servant, who accompnied the Duke of Gloucester at the time of the amperor^ coronation. It is also stated that a reply was made by 'the son of the ex-Sultan of Kaffa, heir presumptive of the Sultanate'; there was however never a Sultan of Kaffa, the principal chief of that province having held the usual Galla title of Balabat. 3. On the 12th October the two Ministers arrived in Addis Ababa, and as part of the ceremony of reception had a number of local notables presented to them. After the Abuna and other dignitaries of the Abyssinian Coptic Church, Ras Seyyun, Ras Kebbede and other Ethiopian personalities (Ras Hailu was still out of town), the Moslem notables were presented, with Aba Jobir at their head, and offered renewed expressions of gratitude and loyalty. 4. On the 15th October a further ceremony took place in honour of the visiting Ministers. The principal Ethiopian notables were once more present (Ras Hailu being still absent), whilst among the representatives of the Mohammedan communities were a person described as 'the Sultan of Harar' (but no such title in fact exists) and seven other chiefs from that region, a Somali 'Sultan' (oron the 12th and the 15th October was included, it is interesting to note, the local head of the firm of Messrs. Mohamedally, as representing the local Indian community. Khan Sahib Daudbhai was among the very few Mohammedan notables who were presented to the visiting Ministers. A number of leading British-protected Arabs and Somalis were also present but do not appear, so far as I can ascertain, to have taken any prominent part in the proceedings. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, to the Chief Commissioner at Aden, to the Governor General of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, to the Governors of Kenya Colony and of the Somaliland Protectorate, to His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Cairo and at Jerusalem, to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad and to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda; and also to His Majesty's Ambassador at Rome • I have, etc., (Signed) Patrick Roberts.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). 1 1 ; 7 ! September 28, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. \ 7690 ' Section 1. [E 6078/56/23] Copy No. 1 ^ ^ Mr. Calvert to Mr. Eden.—[Received September 28.) (No. 259. Confidential.) Sir, Jed da, September 5, 1930. I HAVE the honour to report that, during the past few days, the Italian Legation, through its cavasses, has been engaged in distributing broadcast through the town of Jedda copies of two Arabic newspapers, the Barid Barqah, published at Benghazi, and Al Adi of Tripoli. That the distribution has been lavish would appear from the fact that my Indian vice-consul obtained six copies of each without any apparent difficulty. Apart from a totally incorrect report of 7,n00 British casualties on the North-West Frontier of India (a report also broadcast recently from the Italian wireless station at Bari, causing some concern for a time amongst Indians resident here), the contents of these news papers do not appear to-be open to serious objection, their principal features being items of news of the progress of the Italian subjugation of Ethiopia; the reproduction of an article from the Egyptian Kowab-ash-Sharq on Italian Islamic policy, and referring in particular to the announcement by the Italian authorities that the Arabic language would he used in the courts of law at Harrar; and a number of photographs of Islamic institutions in Italian North Africa. 2. The dissemination in this way of Italian news, of a propagandist nature, is further proof of the interest now manifested by that country in Arabian affairs, an interest which my Italian colleague was said to have stressed, in referring to the friendly dispositions of his Government towards Arab nations, during his audience with Ibn Sand on the 10th May last, reported by Sir Andrew Ryan in his confidential despatch No. 14C&gt; of the 17th May. 3. Brief reference was made in Jedda report for August (paragraphs 263 and 286) to the unusual crop of rumours to which the visit of Amir Feisal to Jedda on the 14th August gave rise. In all of these the Italians figured prominently, and in a favourable light. Three more aeroplanes were to arrive here, it was said, during the Amir’s visit; they were to be brought by an Italian man-of-war; and a high Italian personage was to accompany them presumably to hand over to the Saudi Arab Government, though some reports went so far as to state that he was to supersede Signor Persico (who has remained here this summer) as Italian Minister. These rumours, of course, died a natural death, but the impression in Jedda is, I think, general that the Italians are, for the present at least, on the most cordial terms with the Saudi authorities. Inciden tally, the original Italian offer of aeroplanes was of six machines, of which three only, so far as is known, have been delivered. Three more, therefore, may be said to be overdue, and rumour is again busy, at the time of writing, prophesying their imminent arrival. 4.

In the Italian pages of the same paper, in the issue of the 22nd September, appears a letter of thanks to xarahal Oraziani, for his solicitude towards the Moslem communities of Ethiopia, and particularly for his promise of the construction of a mosque and of assistance for the Mohammedan school. The letter concludes with a declaration of loyalty and attachment to the Italian Government, and is signed by the following Moslem notables:- * 'rinoe'* Abdullah Aba Jbbir Salih Abdullah for Jimma i Kadi Gamei Kadi Ahmed Hajjl Abdussamad Muhammad Yusuf for Harar : The Eight Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., etc. vuhammed* uhamed Sadik Ibrahim Gallon for ^allo i Bhoikh Omar Ibrahim Cheik Abdullah Deria Sheikh Ahmad Adem Bheikh Huaaein for Somalia ; Shaikh Bishir Sheikh lAisa Obai for Shoa ; Sheikh Mu&amp;a Ibrahim Sheikh Gamal Hasan for Garage ; Sheikh Abdurrahman i&lt;ur for Krltrea . 3. One of the Somali eignatoriea* Abdullah lieria ( is a British-protected person and spokesman of the local british Somali community. vhen the letter was presented to him for signature he asked for two days delay and consulted His Majesty’s Consul, who after speaking to me told him that he did not wish to raise any objection to his signing the letter. Objectionable as such mobilisation of British—protected persons — anticipated at the close of my telegram No. 56Q of the 34th August last - may be, it did not seem possible to take exception to it without the risk for this Legation of gratuitous friction with the Italian authorities and of unpleasantness for the person concerned. Neither does there appear to be any immediate possibility of remedying the unsatisfactory state of affairs (Indicated in paragraph II of the enclosure to my despatch No. 177) in which British-protected persons are or fear to be victimisedvictimised if they visit His majesty's Consulates (the experience of His Majesty's Consul at Harar is similar). This matter is, however, the subject of proposals in the fourth paragraph of my telegram Tfo.560 and in item 11 of the enclosure to my despatch ?To.20S3 of the 32nd September. 4. Abdullah Deria states that no other approach has been made by the Italian authorities to the British omali community here, neither have the latter experienced any special difficulties at the hands of the authorities. At the reception reported in the present dee atch, he added, karshal Graziani had said, speaking in particular to non-Italian Somalis, that they had nothing to fear, that many of them had helped his forces and that he did not propose to discriminate against them. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the ■ ovemment of India, to the Chief Commissioner at Aden, to the Governor General of the Anglo-Kgyptian ^udan, to the Governors of Kenya Colony and of the Somaliland Protectorate, to Hie Majesty’s High Commissioners at Cairo and at Jerusalem, to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad and to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. I propose to adopt this distribution for all future despatches on subjects of general Mohammedan interest and trust that you will find this course appropriate.

Article by Muhammad Saadiq, a learned man of alio. The Administration of the Imperial Palace invited the Ethiopian Muhammadan chiefs to visit His Excellency the Viceroy. A mission collected all the chiefs from the various Muhammadan provinces headed by the Amir, Abdulla Aba Jober Sultan of Jlamah. The parties presented themselves before the Governor- General by sects, such as Hararis, fallos and Somalis, so that each party was distinguishable. The Governor-General delivered a speech manifesting the love of Italy for Kuhaamadans and her respect of their religion, and stating that as she sincerely wished for their development and advance, she had obtained Arabic type, so that Arabic versions appear in the papers issued from time to time. He also thanked the Arab and noraali soldiers who fought side by side with Italy and brought victory, and for the relief of the Muhammadans of Harar from the yoke of Ignorant oppression whereby they have been enabled to Join the righteous Italy. The Governor-General concluded by saying t hat Italy made no distinction between Muhammadans, and that great care would be taken in their interests, no matter what their sect and national status were; and at the same time he promised the organization of Law (Ghariah; courts, the construction of a great mosque and of a great Muhammadan school at government expense in the capital, the provision of funds immediately after the rainy season, and their future maintenance by the Italian Government. Haji TraseoHajl Brasao (chief of the ilarari community) on behalf of all l.uhanuuadans thanked Hie Excellency and then submitted the following requests 1. A donation for the Muhammadans * Arabic school* which was at present unable to maintain itself ■&lt; even though the present Director and a Teacher were supported by t he Egyptian r-ovemaent, 3. The supply of all the necessities of the mosque, and 3. Permission for all the Ethiopian Muhammadans resident in the capital to appear before him. His Excellency agreed, and actually complied with these requests, and he ordered the necessary funds to be paid out for the school and mosque as from this September.C0NJID5NTUL .

It was received by marshal Graziani ana speeches were exchanged. Italians attempted to induce spokesman of local British protected Arab com .unity to act as president of newly formed Arab co.i ittee, but he refused and an illiGerctme Yemeni was chosen instead, fhe former was however ooligea go take part in demonstration and read an address containing a ful some praise of Italian regime which had been prepared for him. marshal Graziani in his speech declared that Arabs m agIao jxa could now be confident in protection of Italian flag: 11 they were of other nationality and proteges of this or that power Italy saw in them only . dslems inhabiting Ethiopia and protect ing them all indiscriminately. while in the ordinary way it would presumably be a matter of satisfaction to rlis majesty s Governi.enc Gnat, a Bri gi on co innicy in a loreign country was on friendly terms with autnoriaies of that country the methods adopted in above affair seem go run very closely to an attempt to seduce British protected persons from their allegiance to mis majesty’s Government, established authorities in a country are no doubt responsible for protection of all residents there without distinction but to single out a group..2. group of foreigners for a manifestation of this land is, i submit, quite another natter. Spokesman of British protected Arab community is naturally upset but felt he had no alterna tive but to yield to the extent he did to pressure put upon him. in your telegram No. 406 you were good enough to invite suggestions in amplification of my telegram No. K|d. .Position of negation has been substantially improved by restoration of cypher com unication and failing some new difficulty I have no requests to put forward on this score, more important at present seems to me the question of our virtual inability (please see second paragraph my telegram No. 494), to pro tect our people here from unwarrantable interference by Italian authorities. It would be a minor matter if loss of prestige were confined to this Legation but repercussions can hardly fail to extend to those neighbouring Arab terri tories 'where Italy is busily engaged in securing a foothold and seeming every opportunity of magnifying her influence at our expense. i venture to suggest therefore that in any forthcoming negotiations with Italy (particularly if there is any question of recognizing her position here) we should insist on binding assurances that there will be no attempt to tamper with allegiance of British subjects and protected persons and that in any dealings with them as a body the Italian authorities shall act only through His majesty's Consulates. A more favourable solution would be if in consideration of our recognition.„„..5. recognition of her position here Italy could be induced to dis interest herself altogether in Arab countries in Asia (as we fid in Morocco in exchange for French recognition of our position in Egypt); but I fear nowadays such arrangements are impractic able as savouring unduly of zones of influence and therefore suspect to nationalist feelings. Affair reported in first paragraph of this telegram is dealt with in greater detail in a memorandum by His majesty s Consul at Addis itibaba which went to you under cover of ly despatc n No. 177^ in the bag of August 18th. His experience of Arab countries has enabled him to present the problem in a light which appears to call for serious consideration and suggests as I venture to think desirability of initiating an active policy such as will effectively counter evident Italian aim ox undermining our in fluence in the Arab world. In conclusion I would add that I have reason to believe tnat similar approaches are being made to British protected Somalis here.njry o n o boom o Distribution. d. R.
