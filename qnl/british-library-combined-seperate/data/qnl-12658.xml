The papers cover the effort to come to an agreement on future relations between the two parties following negotiations in the summer of 1921 and up until Britain's unilateral declaration of the end of the protectorate in February 1922.The majority of the memoranda is written by Foreign Office officials, including the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Curzon. Records of meetings of the Cabinet and a sub-committee on the Egyptian situation, and of a few high-level gatherings at 10 Downing Street, make up a substantial part of the file. There is also a large amount of correspondence between Curzon and Field Marshal Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby, High Commissioner of Egypt, on the question of Egyptian independence and events in Egypt. Other papers include printed collections relating to the Egyptian situation that were presented to Parliament.At the back of the file is a chronological summary and a résumé of events in Egypt since the publication of the report of the Milner Mission to Egypt (folios 238-260).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Egypt</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001491.0x000297#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001491.0x000297#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
