Pol. 2255. (Immediate.) India Office, Whitehall, 29th June 1914. Sir, In forwarding for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs enclosed copy of a telegram'^' from the Government of India, the Secretary of State for India desires to offer the following observations upon the measures recom mended by them for the rehabilitation of British interests in South Persia. 2. The Marquess of Crewe agrees with the Government of India that these measures, initiated and carried out in the spirit which animates His Majesty’s Government, would not only be fully compatible with, but would tend actively to promote, the independence and integrity of Persia. But he is constrained to admit that they would not generally be so regarded, while they might easily furnish a pretext to the Russian Government for the initiation of similar measures in a contrary spirit. These considerations must be faced from the outset, but need not be deterrent. 3. It may be more difficult to reconcile the proposed measures with the other obligations of His Majesty’s Government. It is obvious that they could not be undertaken without a previous under standing with Russia, and her probable attitude may be inferred from the reproach made in connexion with the Trans-Persian Railway, that His Majesty’s Government seemed to be seeking a monopoly (of railway construction) in the neutral sphere. Thus the whole question of the Con vention might be raised, and proposals for the enlargement of the British sphere be forced upon us. 4. As regards that contingency, Lord Crewe shares the objections felt by the Government of India to raising the question of abolishing the neutral sphere. Apart from considerations of enlarged responsibilities, increased expense, and possible effect on Moslem sentiment, British com mercial and political interests are so distributed over the neutral sphere as to make relinquish ment of any portion of it to Russia difficult and hazardous. . An examination of the map will render discus sion of this point superfluous, but it is clearly not probable that it will be accepted by Russia. The object of His Majesty s Government should, there fore, be to secure our position in the Gulf and the The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 245.lands bordering on it without raising the question of partition. b. The first step which Lord Crewe would urge is the strengthening of our position in Arabistan. Whatever may be the case in theory, there can be no doubt that the acquisition by His Majesty’s Government of a predominant share in the Anglo- Persian Oil Company has materially extended our responsibilities in Western Persia, and it is fortunate that this has happened in a region in which our political interests are already deeply involved. The maintenance of the status quo in Arabistan has long been recognised as essential to our position in the Gulf, and recent developments have only emphasised that fact. But the course of events that is likely to ensue upon the death of Sheikh Khazal gives rise to some anxiety, and in this connection 1 am to invite attention to the letter from the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 3713, of 7th December 1013, and other correspondence sent to your department on the 16th instant, and to the telegram'^ from the Govern ment of India, copy of which is enclosed. The case is stated with such ability and cogency by Sir P. Cox that detailed comment seems un necessary ; it is, however, for consideration whether the opportunity should not be used to obtain from the Sheikh of Mohammera an undertaking similar to that given by the Sheikh of Xoweit in the Agreement of 23rd January 1899, binding him self, his heirs and successors not to cede, sell, lease, mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory foieign Power, without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government, Lord Crewe would propose, with SirE. Grey’s concurrence, to instruct the Government of India to endeavour, if they see no objection, to obtain such an undertaking; but Dbc C, 9 . r 1)6 ill a position 0 todefend itself against tribal attacks, and Lord Crewe would suggest that it should be required to maintain, at its own expense, a corps of local levies. 8. The subsidy recently renewed to the Tigris and Euphrates Navigation Company should suffice to secure that Company against Messrs. Wonckhaus’ encroachments on the Karim for the next two years, during which it is hoped that the new directorate may see fit to adopt more active and business-like methods for the furtherance of its business ; and Lord Crewe is of opinion that the measures above indicated, taken together, will sufficiently safeguard the position of Great Britain in this most important region. 9. In southern Persia His Lordship attaches primary importance to securing a lease of the islands at the mouth of the Gulf, and to pressing forward with as little delay as possible negotiations with Russia that will permit of the construction of a railway inland from Bunder Abbas. But as regards the latter he is unable to recommend that any further concessions should be made in respect of an alignment east of that place, or of British predominance on the southern section and in the port itself; and he would ask whether it is impossible, irrespective of these negotiations, to arrange with the Persian Government for the commencement of the southern survey. Such a measure, which would seem to be justified by the fact that the Persian Railways Syndicate have a claim on His Majesty’s Government prior to that of the Societe, in respect of a line from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, might serve to bring the Russian Government to a more speedy decision. If the survey is undertaken Lord Crewe would urge that it should be under the protection of a British escort. Its operations will be in districts that have not yet been policed by the Swedish gendarmerie, which is notoriouslv undermanned. 10. The question of this gendarmerie is one of great difficulty. Lord Crewe has hitherto supported the Swedish officers, not because he felt great confidence in their eventual success, but because he realised the grave political objections to the substitution of British officers. Ihe course of events has neither increased his confidence nor diminished the objections; but without endorsing Sir W. Townley’s opinion as to the success that has actually been achieved, so far as the south is concerned, he is impressed by the con siderations advanced in the Minister’s telegram No. 181, of the 19th instant, and recognises that the coronation of the young Shah is the worst possible moment for a change of policy that could hardly fail to throw the new Government into opposition to British interests. Such a step too, would, he thinks, be likely to endanger the success of the programme outlined above, which pre-1 4 supposes a certain amount of good will on the part of the Persian Government. If therefore, fen • Grey approves this programme, and there is a reasonable probability of carrying^ it ^ out, Lord Crewe is of opinion that His Majesty s Government could afford to tolerate the Swedish regime m Lars and Kerman for another year at all events, and to continue to advance funds for the purpose. I»ut he considers it essential (1) that the advances should be administered under the supervision of Jlis Majesty’s Minister, and should not be used out side Pars and Kerman; (2) that the Swedish Government should be pressed not to agree to any modification of the contracts with the new officers in trie directions indicated in Sir W. Townley’s telegram of 18th May, and to see that only first-class officers are sent; (3), that the Persian Government should be urged to instruct the Swedish officers that their first duty is to maintain order on the roads to the coast, and that it should be impressed both on that Government and on the Swedish Government, that inasmuch as the gendarmerie owes its continued existence solely to British money and support, British interests and commerce have a claim upon its services, second only to its obligation of loyalty to Persia ; (4) that orders for supplies in Fars and Kerman should be placed with British and Indian firms. The last is, perhaps, a small matter in itself, but it appears to his Lordship to be one in which His Majesty’s Minister should feel bound to exercise a special degree of watchfulness in behalf of British and Indian commerce. In return for this concilia tory attitude (the continuance of which, however, should be understood to be conditional upon a marked improvement in the efficiency of the force), His Majesty’s Government would expect amenability on the part of the Persian Government in respect of the lease of the islands and other matters men tioned above. 11. Lord Crewe puts forward these suggestions with a sincere desire to avoid a radical departure ii om the traditional policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment in Persia. But he realises that, even if they tire successfully carried out, thej 7 ' are the minimum that is required for the maintenance of British interests, and that they must be supplemented by a firmer resistance of all attempts to push Russian influence south of Ispahan than the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention may, perhaps, be held to justify. If they prove impracticable, he sees no alternative to a revision of that instrument, with ail the disagreeable contingencies that may ensue. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) T. W. Holderness.(O Put away wit P 0 (, From Viceroy, Wth June 1914. [j'iV Foreign Secret. Sheikh of Mohammerah. Please see Pushire letter much as possible owing to large development of British interests in Arabistan, his wishes for modification of assurances should, we consider, be acceded to. \\ e accordingly recommend issue of revised assurances as contained in draft letter forwarded with Bushire letter No. 467, 44th February, copy of which was enclosed in Cox’s weekly letter to Hirtzel, 12 M., 19th March. This we think would serve the purpose indicated in paragraph 14 [paragraph 15 in India Office print], clause 1, of Bushire letter of 7th De cember 1913 referred to above. Sheikh would no doubt appreciate it greatly if we gave him this fresh assurance simultaneously with bestowal of decoration on King’s birthday, and we request permission to do so confidentially. With regard to clause 2, paragraph 14 [paragraph 15 in India Office print], of that letter, we are of opinion there would be no harm in making friendly communication to Bakhtiaris in the manner suggested in paragraph 16 (d) [ paragraph 17 in India Office print]. In regard to clause 3 of paragraph 14 [paragraph 15 in India Office print] of same letter, the action suggested in paragraph 16 [paragraph 17 in India Office print] (b) and (c) would undoubtedly place Mohammerah situation on a satisfactory footing, and an opening or even a necessity for taking it may conceivably arise in the course of explanations which I [is Majesty’s Government may contemplate making to Russian and Persian Governments regarding our action in acquiring predominant share in Anglo-Persian Oil Company. But both the expediency of course proposed and the juncture for taking them seems matter rather for consideration between His Majesty’s Govern ment and His Majesty representatives concerned.

Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Honourable Mr. J. B. Wood, O.I.E., Indian Civil Service, Officiating Secretary to the Government of India, in the Foreign Department, Delhi. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, gi r&gt; 7th December 1913. I have the honour to address you on the subject of our interests in Arabistan and to invite Government to consider whether, having regard to current developments, some steps are not now called for with a view to making our predominant position in the province more definite and secure. y 2. The developments to which 1 allude are both commercial and political and relate to :— n (i) The oil fields and their future. ^ (ii) Irrigation. h v/j \(l^ (iii) Railway enterprise. (iv) Our assumption of the control of the Arabistan telegraphs. (v) The establishment of the Shatt-el-Arab Commission. (vi) Russian and German activity. I shall endeavour to explain certain aspects of these problems as they present themselves to my mind at the present time. 3. The oil-fields and their future .—In the course of the past four years the Anglo- Persian Oil Company may be said to have passed safely through the uncertain and difficult phases inseparable from the inception of great enterprises of the kind, and, provided that the concern can be saved from absorption by more powerful companies, its local prospects, in so far as the possibilities of oil production are concerned, seem all that can be desired; and, as I have stated in a recent letter, I gather that the promoters are deterred from further substantial development of their concession less by any lack of confidence on the part of their shareholders in the productivity of the fields, than by the fundamental uncertainty of the political situation in Arabistan. pit Meanwhile the enterprise has assumed an aspect ol close and even national importance for Great Britain in connection with the urgent necessity which has arisen for earmarking, and assuring ourselves of, sources of supply of oil sufficient for the needs of His Majesty’s Navy in localities easily susceptible in emergency of our effective protection and control. From the economic point of view, the outlook in Arabistan appears to have been found hio-hly favourable by the Commission which has recently visited the fields under Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, but here again, the doubtful factor lies in the want of political stability above referred to, prevailing m the territories in question, qua component part of a decadent empire. A- Ir / 4 Irrigation .—This important subject has recently been brought into renewed prominence in connection with the Karkunan Diversion Scheme, and His Majesty’s Government have approved the suggestion of the Government of India that we should obtain from the Sheikh of Mohammerah a concession for a definite irrigation scheme from the river Karun in his territories. In pursuance of instructions received in this connection, I interviewed the Sheikh of Mohammerah in the summer and discussed con fidentially with him and Major Haworth the subject of such a concession. He then authorised me to inform Government that if the matter should at any moment become urgent, he would Telegram from Resident to Foreign and | )e p re p are d to grant US off-hand any Minister No. 321/1237, dated lltli July concess i on we might desire in this 1913 ‘ direction; he was anxious, however, that certain matters should simultaneously be represented to Government m S. 244. Ai . i , Thici was in July. I was away all August, but meanwhile 18 e tpfi His Maiestv’s Consul, Mohammerah, to consider the matter dJ^ratelfand to let me have his matured views both as to what would be the most convenient form of irrigation concession to ask for, and also as to what the Sheikh’s representations and our needs, m view of the general POll Majm S Haworth^oon afterwards furnished me with a useful memorandum of which I now have the honour to submit a copy. In the meanwhile the Karkunan Diversion Scheme, and with it the question of irrigation from the Karim in Arabistan, ceased to be one of pressing urgency, and I felt unable to submit any definite proposals or recommendations to Government until I had interviewed the Sheikh again, and was aware of the general trend of the verdict of the Admiralty Commission, which was confidentially intimated about this time with the specific object of ascertaining the value and prospects of the oil enterprise both in Arabistan and elsewhere m this sphere. Incidentally I may mention that I am convinced that apart from its political aspect the subject of irrigation is bound to come to the front before long as the natural result of the general commercial development proceeding in Arabistan. Thus, the rapid increase in the population of Ahwaz is beginning to create a specific demand for irrigation in the vicinity , cheap fuel in the form of crude oil is now available; irrigation is being widely discussed in commercial circles, and it is the opinion of local officers, with which I agree, that unless we definitely take the initiative and guide irri gation on the lines we desire, we shall run the risk of being hampered by the raising of the question in some inconvenient form. 5. Railway Enterprise—The progress and prospects of the projected Mohammerah-Khurramabad Railway project are so constantly under the notice of Government in one connection or another that I need offer no detailed comment here, it is suflicient to emphasise the fact that whatever alignment or terminus be ultimately selected, the greater part of the line, and the terminus, must be in Mohammerah territory ; also that the Sheikh has shown every desire to co-operate under our advice, by giving us an option for the fore-shores of the Khor Musa, and by assisting to place us in a position to obtain land for the railway, when the time comes, on favourable terms from the Nizam-us-Sultaneh and other landowners in Arabistan. In fact it is becoming increasingly plain that in the future our commercial position in the Gulf, upon which our political position depends, will be regulated largely by the position which we occupy in Mohammerah and Arabistan, wherein our chief interests are now centred. 0. Assumption of control of the Arabistan Telegraph System. —Little need be said on this head, except that the control of the system by the Indo- European Telegraph Department, as now secured, constitutes an additional quasi-British interest which on the one hand will tend to promote progress in the Province, but on the other hand will demand, if it is to prosper, a greater measure of security in the region traversed than at present exists. **4 7. The establishment of the Shatt-el-Arab Commission. —It is only necessary to mention this important measure in which the interests of Mohammerah are closely concerned, and have been specifically entrusted to the British member of the Commission. 8. Russian and German Competition. —Since the conclusion of the Anglo- Russian Convention, Russian influence has steadily increased in the Russian zone, and is now admittedly predominant even in Ispahan both commercially and politically, a circumstance which gives rise to the apprehension that the Bakhtiaris, who when in the capital, as they have now been for some vears past, of necessity fall to some extent under the influence which is most in # m- • + + • r\ax at too evidence there, may be used to form in * Minister to Foreign Office, No. 188, ,1 i _c o’ i -n n ” liJ - Secret, dated 30th August 1913. f *® WOltlS Of oil \\ alter lowilley 1 ' u the wedge of Russian influence driven down to the Karun.” Russian activity in connection with the Karkunan Diversion3 Scheme is an unwelcome indication that this apprehension of the penotiation of Russian influence from the Ispahan direction, cannot be ignored. From the other direction, the Gulf, we have to cope with increasingly keen German competition which has steadily developed, first from small beginnings, at Fingeh, thence to Rahrain, afterwards to basiah and Moham- merah, and now to the Karun and Ahwaz. Recent instances of it are to be found in the attempt to compete with Messrs. Lynch s steamers on the Karun, followed by overtures for the acquisition of a wharf at Ahwaz and icpoited intentions, not yet confirmed, of competing in the forwarding business to Ispahan. 9. A consideration of the above paragraphs will, I think, demonstrate that commercially we need to pursue an active and enterprising policy in ordei to keep foreign influence and competition at bay, and, secondly, that me material for substantial progress is there to hand, but that the political conditions require strengthening before full advantage can be taken o i , the need for which assumes special urgency if we are to look to Arabistan tor the supply of our national needs in the direction of oil luel. . Before making suggestions as to what steps would seem feasible m the direction indicated, I beg to state our present position as it appears to me to be vis-d-vis (i) other Powers, and ( 11 ) the Sheikh of Mohammerah. 10. In the diplomatic field our special position in the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s territory has received a considerable measure of specno oi indirect recognition from each of the three Powers entitled to be interested in the question. 11. Turkey.—At the time of Vide enclosure to Despatch No. 402, dated 21st June 1810. Sir G. Lowther to Sir E. Grey the Zain incident in 1910 it will be remembered that Plis Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, in a communication to the Wali, referred to Mohammerah as being “ under British protection.” Since hen in connection with the Anglo-Turkish Convention, Mohammerah has l.een the subject of repeated representations to the Porte m which emphasis has been laid 3 upon the close relations existing between His Majesty s Uovcn nent and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. These assertions have not only ii t Ent Ivivp been well received and tacitly accepted and acted 6 upon ; for example! in the matter of the regulation of the Mohammerah frontier • in regard to the representation of Mohammerah interests m t le Riverain Commlsion ; and in connection with the Sheikh s right to purchase and hold real property in Turkey. have^rewiftlj^ bemi^discussecrvLli^th^’Russ’iak^oreiiinmnf in Connection present the actual text of our engagements or assurances has not been ““ifTowever one can judge at all from the opinions expressed and obser- it, however, °“ e ^ J. 6 officials w i t h whom I or other othcers of this vations let drop . c former firmly believe, and in conversa- Residency ^^MoCmerah 5 is under British tutelage, tion “P.I?* r .£ imaffin^thatour engagements with the Sheikh are much more and evide y £ tnallv are.

It Vide telegram 628, dated 26th August seems ’ a question for consideration, 1913, from Sir E. Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. it \ ould not be politic at the present juncture, after overhauling and improving the data, as our interests an- 4 b 'l g Z^hf biis O^ and our claim for a privileged nosition for the Sheikh of Mohammerah and for ourselves m rega,rd to him P In the latter connection Major Haworth reminds me that m dealing with -'n (&lt;w with either of the other Powers for that matter), we have a very strom 5 ' and valid argument in the fact that whereas Russia has recognised our specifl and predominant position in regard to the Persian Gulf Mohammerah and Ahwaz Ire specifically recognised as Persian Gulf Ports, and Mohammerah and its dependencies accordingly fall within the scope of our l ersian Ooas and Islands Order in Council. The Sheikh is not only a riparian ruler but a maritime Arab Chief controlling a strip of the shores of the Gulf rom Mohammerah toDilam, and making his influence practically felt almost to the threshold of Bushire. On these grounds we are not only entitled to occupy a special position in regard to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, but are obliged in the pursuit of our time-honoured policy m the Gulf to see that the Sheikh is maintained in his rights and that the status quo generally is observed. Since writing the above I have received a note from Major Haworth, in which he uses that argument well; I therefore venture to interpolate an extract :— “ In his letter, dated 29th August 1907, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg, confirming the telegram authorising him to sign the Anglo-Russian Convention, Sir Edward Grey wrote that the only reason why the special interests of the British Government in the Persian Gulf were not included in the Convention was that other parts of the Gulf were in territory not Persian. “ Sir Edward Grey’s letter is written in negative form. By reading it in the affirmative we get the following :— r lhe Russians admit the special interests of the British in the Persian Gulf, and had the Persian Gulf been Persian only they would have included it in the Convention. It is only for this reason that the Gulf is not included in the British sphere : therefore the Persian part of the Gulf is admittedly in the British sphere though not specifically named. Thus though frequently by a special study of the Convention it is included in the expression ‘ neutral sphere 1 it is specifically excluded by the admissions of the Russian Government (also by our own actions in those waters for more than 100 years). “Now the territories of the Sheikh of Mohammerah are included in the Gulf, since the greater part of his southern frontier lies on the Gulf, the balance of some 45 miles lies on the Shatt-el-Arab, which river up to Basrah, has always been included in the word ‘ Gulf,’ Basrah being habitually alluded to as a Gulf port, vide notices of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and I expect also of the Russian Steam Navigation Company. “ It is impossible to cut the Sheikh’s territories in two, and we must necessarily include him entirely in our sphere of influence, while our trade interests, together with our capital invested in his country, make it necessary for us to maintain a very special position towards him, and make it incumbent on us to see that his special rights are maintained, to prevent his country coming under the general rot ^ which produces such evil results elsewhere in Persia, these interests are so great that we have been obliged to give him certain assurances in order to ensure stability in our trade. These assurances it is desirable to communicate to the Persian and Russian Governments.” 13. Persia.—On 8th December 1910 His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Geor Baiclay, m answer to enquiries from the Persian Government as to the tru Vide Telegram No. 449, dated of information which had reached the teelf/rSir E.^fey ^ G9 ° , * e t0 t . 1,e f eCt that SM* Khazal W / under the protection of Plis MajesG taoveinment, made the verbal announcement that “the Sheikh was not c *# t“ British protected person, hut that His Majesty’s Government had special “ relations with him, and in the event of any encroachment on his rights he “ would receive their support.” This intimation seems to have been received without comment, and the facts as then stated have been given publicity to in the Press and are well known to all Persian officials and educated Persians generally. Again, recently, in connection with the Muin-ut-Tujjar’s pretension that the Dutch Government were displaying active interest in the question of Karun irrigation from Ahwaz, Sir Walter Townley informed the Persian Premier that “ the railway scheme had much “ increased our already large interests Telegram No. 328, dated 20th Sep tember 1913, from Minister, Teheran, to Resident repeated Foreign Department under Residency No. 1619, dated 20th September 1913. “ in that part of the world.” Apart from the above, the arguments suggested in the preceding para graph based on the position of Mohammerah as a component part of the Gulf sphere can be used with equal force to the Persian as to the Russian Governments. 14. The position as between ourselves and the Sheikh of Mohammerah appears to me to be as follows :— It is a little over a decade since it was recognised that a more vigilant and active policy was called for in order to consolidate our position at the head of the Gulf, which in connection with the Baghdad Railway project and other delevelopments was likely to become the principal arena of development in the near future. This policy had for its primary features the cultivation of close relations with Kuwait and Mohammerah, and the pursuit of it has been attended with the happiest results. Both Rulers have shown themselves to possess statesmanlike qualities and to be worthy of our confidence and support, and both their political status and the commercial prosperity of their territories have been greatly benefitted by the association. Both of them appear to me to have complete confidence in the sincerity of our attitude towards them and in the community of interests on which it is based. Our position at Kuwait may be said to have been definitely regulated by the recent Convention with the Porte, and to be susceptible of little further improvement for the present. In regard to Mohammerah it is not so strong, though so far as the Sheikh’s attitude towards us is concerned it leaves nothing to be desired. He was prompted m 1909 to enter into a most satisfactory agreement with the Oil Company under the D’Arcy Concession, and since his decoration with the K.C.I.E. in 1910 in connection with that matter and others, he has given repeated signs of his confidence and goodwill. Among them I may mention (i) the accord of an exclusive option for irrigation; (ii) the grant of rights of preemption over the foreshores of Khor Musa ; (hi) co-operation” in connection with the railway project; and (iv) in regard to the river frontier and the Riverain Commission. He is now ready to give us a definite concession for irrigating a particular tract of country from the waters of the Karun, and it is ready m draft m case of uigency, in order to enable us if necessary to refer to a concrete concession between specific limits obtained by us from the Sheikh. This, however, has merely been decided by the Sheikh, Major Haworth and myself, for the above colourable purpose, whereas I venture to think that expert advice is necessary for the selection of a suitable scheme. Meanwhile, as explained by Major Haworth in the memorandum 1 accompanying, he urges that his own position is still in some ways precarious, and in view of pro spective developments earnestly desires that it should be examined and strengthened as far as may be within the scope of practical politics. 15 At my farewell interview with him on 4th instant he un burdened himself at length. While expressing the utmost gratitude for the support accorded to him during the past few years and freely acknowledging the benefit he had derived from it, he explained that his own position was still a very difficult one, and that his responsibilities andi • i rlnv He Dressed for assistance in the anxieties became heavier day by day. ne pi “ir^ould the ^ secure by a modifu ation o between the Bakhtiaris (ii) P-e between and him sell, tam ^ immune from the necessity and oZ“r° f-i'™/.—•* *• protection of his territory against their aggression. (hi) That we should endeavour to devise and take measures with 11 Persian Government and in such directions as may be politically nossible to secure to him the status of local autonomy to which the Cory of the past ent.tled him and which he at present enjoys in practice, but on a precarious basis. 16. He puts forward the following grounds in justification of this dcllITl * M That though entirely unassisted and forgotten by the Persian ( } ^ Government, 6 he has maintained his territory in good order while the rest of Persia had been in chaos, and he has paid his revenue fully and regularly to the Imperial Exchequer. 1 (b) That he is personally saddled with full responsibility for paying compensation for losses from piracy, robbery, &lt;kc and the expenses are not deducted by him from revenue but paid from his (c) That he has a large extent of frontier on the flank of his territory but is entirely left to his own devices by the Central Government who give him no instructions and supply him with no arms. Moreover, though the present Boundary Commission is to assemble at and start from Mohammerah, he has up to the present not received a word on the subject from Tehran or from the Foreign Office Agent at Mohammerah. (d) For some time past repeated observations have appeared m various newspapers, giving the impression that he is undei some form of British protection, lie is very thankful for the measure of support which he has hitherto enjoyed, and would be only too glad if he really were under our protection, but as it is, he suffers no little inconvenience from these reports, while not enjoying that feeling of security which actual British protection would give him. 17. I submit that the consolidation of our position in Arabistan is a matter of immediate importance in view of coming developments, especially if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concern is to become more closely associated than at present with the national interests of Great Britain. It seems to me that the position can be considerably improved both by our strengthening the Sheikh’s position, and thus indirectly our own, and also by diplomatic means, in the form of communications to the Russian and Persian Governments in connection with Anglo-Turkish Convention. I beg respectfully to offer the following suggestions for consideration :— (a) That in the first place we should meet the Sheikh’s wishes as far as we can in the matter of the wording of our assurances to him, and that instead of the words “ and be acceptable to your tribesmen,” we should substitute the words, “ and provided always that the “ nomination of your successor from among your descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval “ of, His Majesty’s Government.” (b) That having carried out (a) we should forthwith make confidentially to the Russian Government a fuller explanation of the Sheikh’s practical position of local autonomy, subject always to the main tenance of loyalty, and the regular payment of revenue to the Central Government, and should also communicate to them the grounds and the necessity for ourselves to take a fatherly interestin him, using for this purpose the arguments put forward in paragraph (1) above. (c) That we should then make an analogous communication to the Persian Government, the precise extent and terms of which would require, 1 suppose, to be decided upon in consultation with the Russian Government, and to be such as they would support. It is possible that His Majesty’s Government may not think it expe dient to communicate the text of the assurances to the Persian Government, but after all the terms of them are considerably less pregnant than those in which the Porte has acquiesced in the case of Koweit. In any case we could inform them that, having regard to the position of Mohammerah territory on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and of the great commercial stake which we possess therein, we are obliged to ensure both that the Sheikh is maintained in his position, and his special rights by custom and firman, and that the territories under his control are preserved in the future as they have been in the past from the upheavals which have wrecked and impoverished other provinces of Persia. We might then add that we have informed the Sheikh that such will be our policy and endeavours, provided always that he remains in loyalty and pays his revenue to the Central Government as heretofore. We might make it clear to the Persian Government that such an attitude on our part, while rendered necessary by our own interests above explained, operates entirely in favour of the general interests of Persia, as it has recently, for example, in connection with the negotiations with Turkey on the subject of the land and river frontier in the south. Here our strenuous support of the locally accepted frontier has gained for Persia a far more advantageous solution than she could ever have obtained for herself. (d) I am of opinion that the mere making of such a declaration, of which the Bakhtiari Khans in Teheran would doubtless learn, would operate in a great measure as a deterrent against the recrudescence of serious dissension between them and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Nevertheless, the occasion would seem to be a useful one for making a friendly communication to the Bakhtiari Khans also; in which we should explain to them the position as regards our interests in Mohammerah as a component part of the Gulf system, and in Arabistan generally, and how much we value their friend ship and count upon their co operation in the preservation of tranquillity and order in Arabistan generally and on the Ispahan road. We might add that their present apparently complete rapprochement with the Sheikh of Mohammerah was a source of much gratification to us, and that we trust that the terms of any definite agreement come to would be commiiijbated to us by the parties in a friendly way, in the hope that tne adoption of this course would tend to promote the permanency of any agreement reached. 18. In case the subject of this communication may come up for discussion at an early date, in connection with the Oil Commission’s Report, I am taking the liberty of sending a copy to the Political Secretary; India Office, as well as to His Majesty’s Minister, and very much hope that higher authority will not see reason to dissent to any fundamental extent from the views and recommendations which I have ventured to lay before them. I have, &amp;c., ?. Z.CoS Political Resident, Persian Gulf, and His Majesty’s Consul-General for Kars, &amp;c.Memorandum by Major Haworth on our relations will, the Sheikh of Mohammeran. * looirl nt Tliq Maiestv’s Consulate, Mohammerah, on the -.Cm TqYrrt whiclf he Sheiidi the Resident, His Majesty’s Consul and HaiHtais^were present ; the Sheikh explained at length the difficulties which he had had to face during recent times, and asked whether it would not be sible for him to receive some undertaking, beyond the assurances which ’he td received, in order to secure him from the recurrence of such situation^, laine^ ^ ^ had been ob l ige d to collect large armies two years in succession, in order to protect Ins frontiers trom encroachments, and sai that he was unable year after year to meet the expenditure which was ent pje referred to the encouragement which he had given and was prepared to give to British trade, and, with reference to the question ol the Karim Irrigation, said that he was prepared to give us anything we wanted, but that he would like to feel that, in return for the various concessions and other facilities which he was giving, he was obtaining some measure oi 860 He pointed out that, as matters stood, the increase of European firms and the introduction of British capital into his districts increased his responsi bilities enormously, and he was held to be answerable for their safety and welfare, while on the other hand, if his responsibilities had so increased, his liabilities with regard to internal affairs had fully kept pace and the strain was getting too great. . He expressed his gratitude for the assurances vliich had been given him in October 1910, but explained that matters had progressed since those days, and he felt that with the new conditions which had arisen, new requirements had also come to light. In other words he asked for an extension of the measure of protection which he was receiving in order that he might obtain an increased feeling of security for himself and his successors. The thought of disturbances in his territories on his death also upsets him and the proviso which we inserted in our assurances of 1910 regarding his male descendants to the effect that “ so long as . . . they . . . shall continue to be acceptable to your tribesmen” is also a source of some uneasiness to him. The reason for this uneasiness is to a certain extent due to our own action in recent events. The Persian Government is perhaps getting accustomed to our relations with the Sheikh, though it cannot be said that those relations are a source' of pleasure or endear the Shaikh to it; but I think that there is little doubt that to certain ol his tribes his tendency to admit the foreigner is far from being a cause of gratification, and they have only given way to his arguments on the grounds which he has advanced of the security which results from the friendship with the British and the protection which they receive in their lands and properties. This argument has received a considerable blow this year from the dangei which arose in the spring of a Bakhtiari attack and the consequent gathering of the Arab clans which was involved. Where, they ask, is the value of the British friendship if every year we are to be obliged to fight for our lives and properties ? It will be remembered that at the time of the Bakhtiari incident 1 pressed very strenuously that we should be as much as possible in evidence at any arrangement which might be made between the two parties. My reason for this is threefold. First, I wished that the Arabs should see that we are taking steps to prevent a breach of the peace ; secondly, that if we were obviously the means of making the peace our future influence over both Arabs and Bakhtiaris &gt; ! r &lt; i v9 written by them to the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz undoubtedly strengthens its value, but past history shows that the Bakhtiaris have frequently broken their word to us. Thus though we can be certain of making the Sheikh adhere to the terms of his agreement, we are unfortunately not in a position to say the same with regard to the Bakhtiaris. This the Sheikh feels, and it causes him considerable anxiety. Though the Bakhtiari question is one of the active causes which lias made the Sheikh approach ns, it does not constitute the whole cause, but is rather a strong- link in the chain of events which has made him consider the general question of his position. The recent history of Persia gives him cause to think ; he sees Russian influence spreading in the north, and considers that Persia is steadily and surely falling to pieces. He has, I am afraid, no faith m the power of Nasir-ul-Mulk to assist even or to stem the tide. In the circumstances I trust that I may be pardoned if I attempt to out line the situation as it would appear to exist. Our policy during recent years lias been to avoid anything which could lead to a possibility of intervention on our part, and as a consequence, we have attempted to bolster up Persia and to make it stand upon its own legs, while in the north the Russians, who have not been handicapped by the same fear, have used their forces to assist in the pacification of the country. In the furtherance of our object we have assisted in the formation of a gendarmerie, officered by Swedish officers, and, at the present minute the future of Persia depends upon the success of this movement. Should it fail there will be a condition of confusion worse confounded, for which condition it will be necessary to be prepared. Should, however, we postulate the gendarmerie to be a success, we shall have the customs in the hands of the Belgians, and the Persian Government forces in the hands of the Swedes. In addition the revenues, posts, and telegraphs will be in the hands of the Belgians ; this latter, however, can only be a temporary measure, for with peace and quiet in the country, there would have to be an extension of the number of the Europeans in charge of departments, and 1 cannot believe that we shoidd find it politic to have these departments entirely managed by Belgians controlled by one head, of their own nation, who might be influenced against us and repeat the programme of Monsieur Nans. It would be better to have an international service than to have complete Belgian control. Whatever the system, however, it can but result in an increased number of Europeans and general European control. To take Persia out of its present financial chaos an honest administration is required, and there are not sufficient honest men in Persia to supply the offices of one district. The classes from which the officials and governors of the country are recruited are hopelessly corrupt, and the Customs Department itself, which has been for so many years under Belgian control, is a sufficient proof of the impossibility of any department being left to Persians ; it is a commonplace that were the Belgians removed the department would fall to pieces in six months. Such European control in Arabistan is bound to come into opposition with rights and powers of the Sheikh. % In our assurances of 1910 we guarantee the Sheikh against encroachment on his rights or privileges on the part of the Persian Government. These assurances were dictated by our policy in the Gulf and recent events have shown the wisdom of the policy which determined them. That European control of the revenue, Customs and gendarmerie is bound to result in opposition to the rights of the Sheikh is shown by the history of the Customs Department in Mohammerah. That department has from the first aud until to-day attempted to override the rights and privileges of the Sheikh as contained in his firmans. In these conditions vre shall have to support the Sheikh at a time when that support will not be easy or we shall have to let our assurances to the Sheikh go by the board and with them our exceptional position in Arabistan. Up to the present v interests in Arabistan have been absolutely British and the only foreign firm, that of Messrs. Wonckhaus, has been of no importance. With the opening up of the country, however, and the arrival10 of the railway foreign firms will arrive in force and complicate the situation. It is then time for us to take stock of events. Our interests in Arabistan are so great both politically and commercially that the practical autonomy of the Sheikh and our control over him become matters of moment to us. , ^ i , i i i Since the giving of the assurances to the Sheikh matters have advanced considerably. We are about to build a railway in Arabistan, we have an option on the Khor Musa, we are to represent the Sheikh on the Conservancy Board for Shatt-el-Arab, the Sheikh has promised us that should it be necessary he will give us a concession for irrigation on the Karun, while the Oil Company has just obtained from him permission to bore for oil at Ahwaz. In return it is not much that he should ask for an increased measure of security for himself, while the fact cannot lie too much underlined that the Sheikh’s interests are our material interests. In a recent speech the First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the necessitv of our opening up all the oil fields which we could in British territory. The present oil fields of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company lie just beyond the Sheikh’s lands though the refinery is at Abadan, but 8 miles from Mohammerah as the crow Hies and on the Sheikh’s property. He has now agreed, on very favourable terms to the Company, to drilling for oil at Ahwaz should oil be found there, and the geologists are very sanguine ; then oil field, pipe line, and refinery will all be within his territory. With the Persian Gulf in our hands the advantage of having the control of this country through the Sheikh is evident and any lessening of his authority will act to our detriment. The greater the power of the Sheikh the greater our control; the greater his autonomous powers the more he will put himself in our hands, for he understands that he cannot stand alone. The Sheikh would willingly put himself entirely under our protection were that possible, and, indeed, has often told me he wished that he could do so. He has even said that he wishes that we could administer his lands for him, paying him a fixed revenue. He fully realises the immense grain and cotton growing possibilities of Arabistan with its rivers and canals, but knows that an Arab like himself is incapable of developing it. With the Central Government at Tehran it is, I suppose, impossible to talk of a protectorate, but it would appear that there could be no objection to our referring to our very special position and interests in Arabistan, and to informing the Persian Government that in consequence we have also very special relations with the Sheikh, and that these relations make it impossible for us to tolerate any infringement of the rights and privileges which he has acquired. Such a position would gradually stiffen into an actual pro tection without interfering with the Persian suzerainty. It would enable us to give the Sheikh the support which he requires and at the same time enable us to obtain over Arabistan the control of oil and other industries which we wish to develop. 2nd August 1913. L. Haworth, Major, His Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan.To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. M I have the honour to reply to Foreign Department letter No. 2769-E. A., of December 18th 1913, requesting the Resident to furnish the Government of India with the draft of a formula which in his opinion would satisfy the Shaikh of Mohammareh without committing the British Government further. 2. The late Mr. Lorimer addressed His Majesty's Consul at Mohammareh on the subject and forwarded, for an expression of his opinion, the draft of which a copy forms the first enclosure to this letter. He suggested that the best means of communicating the same to the Shaikh would be by a written communication refer- VUe enclosure 2 to this office letter No. 73- ^ J?™ , t0 ^ C °f S l ett « 307 of 2831, of 23rd October 1910, to His Majesty’s AotnUCtOber 1910, and Saying that Govern- Minister, which formed an enclosure to Sir Uieilt had been pleased to substitute the ttf2M I ol r £?9lo m “ ent ’ NO ' 2832 ’ dated ? ew formula for the last sentence thereof in order to meet his wishes as expressed to Sir Percy Cox. 3. Major Haworth, who had come down to Bushire specially to discuss this and other matters regarding ' Arabistan with the late Resident, states that the draft in question will in his opinion meet the case of the amended assurances per fectly. He suggests, however, that in order to avoid all possible confusion it would be as well to issue a new and revised version of the whole of Sir Percy's letter No. 307 above referred to. 4. I have accordingly ventured to forward to Government for consideration the draft which forms enclosure 2 to this communication and have drawn it up in the form in which I would suggest it being communicatedto the Shaikh of Moham mareh.

I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India No. 127-c., dated 13th September 1913. copies of three recent communications, So! dat'd %\l addressed to me by HisBritannic Majesty’s . Consul at Mohammerah, on subjects connected with the interests primarily of the Shaikh and then of ourselves. The letters discuss respectively (i) The Mohammerah succession and Shaikh Khazal’s desire for an unqualified assurance. (ii) The possibility of the need by the Shaikh, in the near future, of a European adviser. (iii) The contingency of gendarmerie being sent to Arabistan. 2. I was absent most of October, and was also anxious, before addressing Government, to have a further talk with the Shaikh and Major Haworth, on the general outlook. I have undertaken to do so before I leave ; meanwhile I beg to forward the several communications for information, with the following brief comment (i) Shaikh Khazal’s feelings are no doubt very much those displayed by the Shaikh of Kuwait, as reported in my letter No. 3359, of 9th instant. I feel confident that a formula could be found which would satisfy them without committing us further. (ii) I concur in thinking that developments may very likely incline the Shaikh in this direction, but I will report further after seeing him. {iii) I have asked His Majesty’s Minister to be forewarned, in regard to this possible contingency; but have no reason to think that any grounds for the apprehension at present exist. Enclosure No. 1. No. 127-C., dated Mohammerah, the 13th September 1913. From— MAJOR L. Haworth, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that I have recently had a conversation of great interest with Shaikh Khazal on the subject of his present heir Shaikh Chasib and the succession. This question, as you are aware, has been for some time exercising my mind but it is one which, notwithstanding my desire to obtain definite information, has been delicate ground to touch on either with the Shaikh or with any of his people; thus the only person of importance with whom I have been hitherto able to discuss the matter has been Haji Rais who frankly expressed his opinion of the hopelessness of making anything of Shaikh Chasib, though the latter is his own son-in-law. Chasib is in some ways shrewd and intelligent but he appears wanting in any of the qualities which go to make a ruler. His chief fault, from the Shaikh’s point of view, has been his refusal to take any steps to ingratiate himself with the chiefs of tribes upon whom his very Shaikhdom would depend and notwith standing Haji Rais’s constant advice, he neglects all opportunities of entertaining or seeing the “ gilits ” of the various sections which make up the Shaikh’s juris diction.2 Complaints on this subject have naturally reached the Shaikh’s ears and some months ago he appointed a man named Khallaf, one of his trusted servants, to assist Chasib at AhwaZ and more particularly to see that important^ tribesmen arriving at that place were properly treated and entertained in Chasib’s name. With this agent of the Shaikh Chasib has quarrelled and a few days ago he came down to Mohammerah to see his father in the matter and to complain about him ; there is little doubt also that Chasib was responsible for the telegram to your address complaining of the tyrranical conduct of one of the Shaikh’s servants, the servant referred to being of course the same Khallaf. The Shaikh, who is undoubtedly fond of Chasib, has spoken to him very clearly and has told him that if he finds the weight of Government, and the duties which are a necessary accompaniment thereof, to be too heavy for his shoulders, it would be better for him to realise the fact and to resign the prospect of succes sion, that suitable provision would be made for him and that he would have all he wanted but that one of the other sons would be named heir in his place. After thinking it over Chasib said that he would wait two months till the chiefs of the Muhaisin and Chaab came in to see the Shaikh and that he would then ask them if they would give him their support: if they answered in the affirmative he would undertake the responsibilities of the position, but if they did not seem anxious to support him he would resign. This answer, which is certainly not Chasib’s own, appeared to the Shaikh so sensible that he immediately consented to it and so the matter rests for the present. It now remains for us to survey the matter from our own point of view. Our own interests in the country demand a stable Government. The longer the Shaikh lives the easier will be the task for his successor, for he has welded together the loosely connected elements of his rule and year by year the unifica tion will become more complete. A weak Governor, unpopular with his people would however soon cause the disintegration of the factors so carefully brought together by Shaikh Khazal and with the dissatisfaction which would prevail a fertile ground would be prepared for the sowing of the germs of sedition and dis loyalty which would end m the weakening of the power of the Shaikhdom and its subsequent disappearance as a power of any value either to its holder or to The history of the past few years has shown how easily this would t accomplished in Arabistan under a less acute rule than that of the present regim True loyalty is not very common in Persia and the very poor substitute therefi possessed by the majority will rarely withstand bribery : the inimical tribes o the bhaikhs border would have caused dissension had there been less confident in-the Shaikh s powers, a confidence which has always been greatly increase by the knowledge of the relations between the Shaikh and ourselves. Our political, even more than our commercial, interests demand a strnn government of the Shaikh with the confidence of the people. I do not believe that this could be obtained with Shaikh Chasib. bp nn? dlfficult to form a i ust opinion about one who is so voum miaL ?

The only point in his favour is that he has reached man’s estate but as he would need a Regent as much as a younger brother and would be more difficult to control, the fact does not count for much. 1 he government of Mohammerah has been carried on for the past sixteen years by the Shaikh and Haji Rais in consultation. It is purely a two-horse show. The only other man capable of any assistances Shaikh Hanzal, the Shaikh’s Commander-in-chief when occasion demands, and the son of his eldest brother Shaikh Muhammad who died at Mecca. Owing partly no doubt to the fact that he had a Persian mother Shaikh Muhammad did not succeed on the death of Shaikh Jabir, a younger brother Shaikh Mizal, the predecessor of the present Shaikh replacing him. Of other local notables Agha Abdi, the Deputy Governor, is a man of ability and some force of character but quite uneducated being unable to read or write. It is becuming increasingly difficult for him to keep pace with the modern development of Mohammerah and its resultant requirements. Haji Rais has a son, Haji Mushir, who is, during Haji Rais’s absence on It ave, carrying on for the Shaikh such of the duties usually performed by his father as he can cope with. Though clever he has not the character nor the desire to step into his father’s shoes and is as yet but 26 years of age. Agha Abdi’s sons are traders pure and simple. They have no place in the Government nor are they capable of assuming such a position. It will be seen then that with the death of the Shaikh and Haji Rais— and the latter is an old man while the former suffers from diabetes though he is not in any immediate danger—the situation would need some watching. The only man capable of action would be Shaikh Hanzal. It is on meeting a situation like/one realises the value, in troubled time even the necessity, of the tribal custom so frequently met with in the east by which succession goes, not to the eldest son but to the eldest living member of a family. The alternative to the succession of Chasib is that of one of his brothers, f These are all some years younger than Chasib, the next lot coming in a group of four with but little between them in point of age. The eldest of these is Abdul Hamid. They are all together at Mr. van Ess's American Mission school at Basrah and of Abdul Hamid I hear very good reports. ^ In accepting the possibility of the question of succession arising it is neces sary for us to realise that it might occur at any time though there is no reason to hope anything but that the Shaikh will live for many years to come. Should then Abdul Hamid be declared the heir, failing Haji Rais, there is no one but Shaikh Hanzal who could possibly act as Regent. Hanzal was, as you are aware, for many years Governor of Ahwaz till 1909, his removal being caused by the report of a plot to assassinate the present Shaikh with a view of putting Hanzal in his place. It is more than doubtful whether the latter had anything to do with the plot, the idea being that advant age was taken of the opportunity to place Chasib in charge of the Government at Ahwaz. In any case the Shaikh has always had a certain amount of jealousy of Hanzal and has not desired to see him too much to the fore in tribal matters. In this he may have had a certain amount of right for I .think it highly probable that were the condition of affairs the same as they were some few years ago and had the question arisen Hanzai would be selected by the tribes in preference to Chasib. With the further settlement of the place, with the increase of Europeans in the district and the consequent British interests which have arisen and more especially with the assurances which we have given him,^ the Shaikh s fear of Hanzal has somewhat diminished and he has employed him more than once as his Commander-in-Chief in his recent difficulties with the Bakhtiaris and at Shushtar. Shaikh Hanzal himself is a very decent man, not unlike the Shaikh in appearance and somewhat resembling him in character. He would have no ambitions regarding succession knowing that without our support they would be 2\tft’T'T h-. ■ .■ ■ ■ \ untenable I think that there is no doubt that he would be as amenable to our influence as is the present Shaikh and would as Regent be able to preserve e continuity of the present rule. In this reference it will recur to your memory that in the actual assurances C which we gave to the Shaikh as opposed to the copy which was to be shown to rhe tribes we stipulated that he and his successors should continue to be acceptable to the tribesmen. The developments of the general situation have made the Shaikh w!sh to see these words eliminated, as I reported in the memorandum which I forwarded with my letter No. m-C., dated and August last. The question turns very largely on the view taken of the suggestion which I made in the memorandum referred to. I would recommend however that the words in question should be eliminated. I do not think that they add particularly to the elements of stability which we require while they open the way to intrigue should they become known. In substitution therefor I would recommend that we should give the Shaikh the unqualified assurance he demands with reference to succession but that we should in consequence equally demand that we should be consulted on the question of the determination of the Shaikh’s successor. This right, which I have no doubt the Shaikh would readily admit, would strengthen our position greatly and would at the same time obtain what was required in the former wording. Enclosure No. 2. No. 128-C., dated Mohammerah, the 13th September 1913. From— MAJOR L. Haworth, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, I have the honour to inform you that some days ago the Shaikh, in discus sing local matters with me, referred to the difficulties which followed in the train of the development of Mohammerah and said that he often debated whether he had not been happier in the old days before he had to undergo the tear and strain the result of what was expected from him now in consequence of his enhanced responsibilities. He finally said that he felt that he would be obliged to get an European to act as an adviser to him. A few days later Haji Mushir, in discussing the arrangements of the town made exactly the same statement as being a necessity. I cannot think that this was mere coincidence and it suggests that the subject had been debated. In recent letters I have argued that it is certain that the Belgians will endeavour to increase their numbers in Arabistan and that the natural result will be the continued attempt to encroach on the Shaikh’s privileges. Of this we already have signs. On the other hand it is also certain that with the steady increase of uropeans in this district, with the arrival of a railway and the formation of a port, the Shaikh will not be able to carry on with the officials now at his disposal. The strain is already telling on such as the Deputy Governor, who has been all his life accustomed to governing by rule of thumb in a glorified Arab village, and is somewhat flabbergasted at the nature of the complaints which he receives trom European residents. In fact Haji Rais is the only one who takes to new conditions completely. I gave no answer to either the Shaikh or Haji Mushir on the subject of an European adviser andthe matter has not been raised again but! imauine that fresh difficulties will bring up the subject once more. &amp; magine thatThe multiplication of the Belgian will certainly be to our disadvantage and to keep him out it will always be possible to argue that, as long as the Shaikh pays his revenue and continues to administer his country satisfactorily, the Persian Government can well turn its attention to parts of the country where such desi rable results have not been attained, but sooner or later we shall be obliged to consider the question which 1 am now putting up to you and I shall be glad to get some instruction as to the general line I should take should the matter be again raised. Enclosure No. 3. No. 136-C., dated Mohammerah, the 27th September 1913. From— Major L. Haworth, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the memorandum forwarded with my letter No. 11 i-C., dated 2nd August 1913, I have the honour to inform you that the Shaikh called on me to-day and informed me that he had received a letter from Tehran saying that gendermerie under Swedish officers were to be sent to Arabistan. The letter was a private one but the Shaikh seemed to place reliance on it. He said that he was not anxious to have gendermerie on his territories which he could perfectly well keep in order himself and pointed out that they could be much better employed in places such as Luristan, where order did not exist. I have anticipated that gendermerie would be sent to Arabistan, and pre sumably their headquarters would be at Shushtar. Should there be truth in the report I trust that we shall be able to bring pressure to bear for their use at Dizful or nothwards of that town thus freeing the Shaikh and his territories of their presence. They are not required south of Shushtar while north of that place and especi ally at Dizful and in Luristan they would find much scope for their activities. The Shaikh also referred to the fact that his friendship with us was well received by those of the powers that be at Tehran who w\ere friendly to him but that it was the source of remark to those who were opposed to him and to us. He feared that some of them, in consequence, wished, if possible, to encroach upon his privileges. I should like to take the opportunity to reiterate the opinion which I have expressed that we should inform the Persian Government of our special relations with the Shaikh, otherwise I feel assured that we shall have to do it at a time when, the Persian Government having taken some step to encroach on the bhaikh s rights, we shall have to do so under the assurances which we have given him. Such a moment may well be awkward, especially if it is in connection with questions in which either Swedes or Belgians are concerned.

SIN CL the affray between the gendarmes and the Bakhtiaris that has formed the subject of preceding despatches, the question of British officers to instruct the Bakhtiaris ha| again been raised. It will be remembered that I reported in my despatch No. 231 of the jth November, 1912, that Samsam-es-Sultaneh, at that time president of the Council, had expressed to me a wish that His Majesty’s Government would furnish a pertain number of officers whose duty it would be to organise and train a force of Bakhtiaris which he estimated at 10,000 men. He owns that he spoke on that occasion more particularly in his own name, although lie felt confident that in doing so he was voicing the wish of all the khans. He now says that all his relations would welcome the advent of British military instructors in Bakhtiaristan, and would also much like to see them take charge of the 300 men who are to remain at Tehran, although they realise that it might be difficult to arrange this. It will be seen from a perusal of a despatch that goes to you, Sir, by this bag that the general political situation in Persia appears to me to be a very critical one, and that there is, unfortunately, some reason to fear a recrudescence of troubles in the south, whilst the recent incident at Tehran can hardly fail to produce no small amount of excitement among Bakhtiaris. There are evident signs that, for various reasons, Russian influence is growing apace at Ispahan, which may be looked upon to-day as a Bakhtiari stronghold. The Bakhtiari Governor-General, Vice-Governor, and their followers are daily made aware of the fact that Russia’s word is knv in Ispahan, and that the voice of the British consul-general, in strict observance of the spirit of the Anglo-Russian Convention, is no longer heard in a town in which British influence was predominant three or four years ago. From Ispahan to Ahwaz, via the Bakhtiari country, is not a far cry, and it would appear to me that, unless we speedily do some thing to prove to the Bakhtiaris and the rest of Persia that we are faithful to our ancient friendship for the tribesmen that can furnish the backbone of a strong natural barrier between North Persia and that part of the country in which British interests are still predominant, we shall find the wedge of Russian influence driven down to the Karun by peaceful penetration under arms,Vis' my Russian colleague so aptly described the position in the province of Azerbaijan the other day. No effort is needed on the part of Russia. In scrupulous observance of our convention, w T e stand aside to-day from all inteference in Ispahan. Under the circumstances, no one can be surprised if the Bakhtiaris, on their return home from Tehran and Ispahan, tell their brethren that the Russian is all-powerful in Persia to-day, and that the friendship of Great Britain, as a valuable asset, is a thing of the past. The placing of the large properties of the Zil-es-Sultan under the management of the director of the Russian bank at Ispahan has doubtless been looked upon as a matter of small importance, and full credence has been given to the assurances of M. Poklewsky and others that the Russian Government took no part in the transaction. Whether this is true or not makes no difference ; public opinion in Persia recognises in it a fresh Russian move southwards, and M. von Haver, who has placed armed men on all the properties, has succeeded in resisting the claims of such an influential man as Samsam-es-Sultaneh to certain villages which he bought for a song from a man who possibly had but a shadowy claim to them. If M. von Kaver had not been a Russian he could not have resisted the claim of the former president of the Council. It is not known at Ispahan connection with the arrangement under that the Russian Government disclaim ah —witix tuc which the Zil’s lands were placed under Russian protection, but it is known that M. von Kaver is reported to have said that he was acting under the instructions of the legation. Perhaps he never said it; but people in Ispahan .believe he did, a fact which speaks for itself. Were it to be found desirable or feasible to lend the Bakhtiaris a few military [1870 i/—10]• ■ „ )n down the ill-feeling towards the officers much would be done, in myJP 1 &gt; 1 , t f the Bakhtiaris for some time gendarmes which is joatl'would be assured; and the task of the to come; the safety of the baMtmr turbu lent factors m that province knew that*^ powerful r^we^rmed Bakhtiari force under British officers was m the near ; neighbourhood. j have, &amp;c.

WITH reference to your Excellency’s telegram of the 26th May communicating to me the Foreign Office telegram No. 113 to His Majesty’s representative at Tehran, I have the honour to report that on the 20th May I wrote to the acting vali privately, and suggested that some expression of regret should be made to the Sheikh of Mohammerah for the death of his wife and the inadvertent attack on his mother’s house, and that some reparation might be offered for the damage done to it. I said I thought it would disarm criticism if this were done, and I proffered the suggestion in the best interests of the vali. The acting vali communicated my letter to the vali. I have the honour to enclose a copy of the vali’s reply as communicated to me by Saad Bey, and of my answer. The vali no doubt desires to receive the sheikh’s reply to his letter before making any advance, and he seems at present a little untractable, which is perhaps due to the handsome ovation he received on his arrival at Bagdad and the congratulatory telegram from Constantinople on his action at Zoin. But, if the sheikh answers in the way proposed by the Foreign Office, I hope to be able to persuade him to meet us in the matter. I am informing the acting vali to-day of the lines on which His Majesty’s Government hope to effect a reconciliation, as I gather from the vali’s telegraphic reply that he is disposed to resent my intervention, and it may reassure him to know that His Majesty’s Government are aware of his difficulties, and wish to give him reasonable assistance.

Foreign Office, August 26, 1913, 12'20 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 312 I will furnish the Russian Government with full explanations respecting first three paragraphs of Russian aide-memoire shortly. As regards Mohammerah, no position of independence is claimed for the sheikh, who is mainly concerned, and is actually mentioned, because he is the man whose commerce and shipping, owing to his geographical and territorial position, is chiefly involved. It was in order to avoid any appearance of setting him up as independent that the expression c ‘persans ” instead of “de Mouhammera ” was used. Moreover, when the Persian Government wished to introduce the Belgian customs administration into Arabistan they did so by means of an agreement with the sheikh, recognising his special position, which includes that of a hereditary ruler. The Russian Government are aware that His Majesty’s Government have for many years past had very close relations with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whose interests touch theirs in many important points, but so far are they from being conscious that there is anything in their policy “ hardly consistent with principle of Persian integrity ” that they have always, in writing to the sheikh, made loyalty to the Central Government one of the conditions on which their support of him has depended.

This has been a cause of regret to me, but I am very glad now to be able to visit Your Excellency here in your palace at Failiyeh, and the pleasure of coming has been greatly en hanced by the auspicious nature of my present errand. I am commanded by Eis Majesty's Government to announce to Your Excellency that my august Sovereign, King George the Fifth, may his Kingdom endure, has been pleased to confer on you the high honour of a Knight Commandership of the Indian Empire and I am on their behalf to present you with the Insignia thereof. This indication of good will and esteem on the part of his Majesty's Government is conferred on Your Excellency as a mark of their appreciation of your sustained effortsto preserve order and security for trade in the districts under your control and thereby to assist the progress of civilisation and commerce. Unfortunately, as we all know, many districts in Persia have now for a long time been disturbed and trade routes interrupted. It is therefore all the more a matter of congratulation to you that this region has not fallen into a similar plight. With this short preface, I will proceed to present Your Excellency with the said decoration, and in doing so I need only add the hope that you may long be preserved to render loyal and patriotic services to your own Government and to continue, as in the past, to promote the cordial relations which have long existed between the Shaikhs of Kohammerah and the British Government, from the time of Shaikh Kaji Jabir Khan until now.■KS 42 The terms in which His Excellency Shaikh Khazal Khan, Shaikh oi Mohammerah returned thanks for his presentation with the Order of K.C.I.E.

During the same interview he mentioned that the assurances as now given did not refer to the question of his customs or to our own probable attitude towards him in the event of the break-up of Persia. . , XT These points were covered by items 5 and 6 of Foreign Office despatch .No. 108, dated the 6th July, to Mr. Marling, and I disposed of them on the lines indicated by His Majesty’s Secretary of State in that communication. The sheikh did not press them, saying that he was now greatly reassured by what we had given him, and most grateful for the document now vouchsafed. As regards his customs, he ultimately made a fresh proposal or offer which requires dealing with separately on its merits. In fact, the whole question of the Mohammerah customs, by the light of eight years of the Belgian administration, needs bringing up to date, and I have asked Lieutenant Wilson to draw up a memorandum on the subject, and submit it with the sheikh’s present proposal. 6. I should mention that on arrival at Mohammerah I found the Sheikh of Koweit in his launch, anchored at Failiyah alongside Sheikh Khazals palace. It seemed to me that his presence at the presentation of the K.C.I.E. to his fidus Achates might be taken advantage of to revive the former reports crediting the two sheikhs with sinister Arab ambitions, to which we lent secret encouragement. I therefore had a talk with Sheikh Mubarak, who readily fell in with my views (in which Sheikh Khazal inwardly concurred), and spent the day of the ceremony at Bussorah, with Ahmed Zuhair Pasha, returning the morning afterwards. 7. I am sending this communication with enclosures (of which I attach a list) via London, with a copy to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, and am also forwarding a copy to the Government of India. IN continuation of my letter dated the 9th October, 1910, to your address, to be observed.

I feel the utmost gratitude and pride for these favours, and it goes without saying that my position in the future will be the stronger for them , while the prosperity of Mohammerah and its dependencies will be increased, and foreign commerce and enterprise promoted therein. _ I beg that you will be good enough to communicate my representations to the big authorities of the British Government.

It appears to me that Mr. Crow, in his treatment of this question, has failed to realise what are the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the sheikh and the true interests of Great Britain in the regions of the Persian Gulf, and that this is proved by his failure to inform your Excellency by telegraph of the vali’s projected attack on \jo Zein as soon as it came to his knowledge (see his despatch No. 22 of the 23rd April to ^ your Excellency), a step whereby most of the complications which subsequently arose might very likely have been avoided, and by the statement in his letter of the 27th April to His Majesty’s acting consul at Mohammerah, that the sheikh’s day of reckoning had come, and that, though the action of the Turkish authorities might be arbitrary, he would press for them to be supplied with the proper means to carry it through (see enclosure No. 6 in Colonel Cox’s despatch No. 2, Confidential, of the 16th June). I cannot but consider that Mr. Crow’s conduct in connection with this incident has been injudicious and ill-calculated to further the policy of His Majesty’s Government, and I must request your Excellency to call on him for an explanation of his general treatment of the question, and, in particular, of his attitude on the two points specified above.

We are bound to use our good offices to secure an adjustment and to guard against a repetition of offensive action. The ownership of so much land on the Turkish side and the presence of many Arab subjects perhaps to some extent justify Turkish suspicions in their present susceptible mood, and it seems to me that some compromise must in the end be found if an adjustment is to be secured and a repetition of the same sort of incident avoided. I would propose in the first place to inform, the Porte that His Majesty’s Government are bound, under agreement with the sheikh, to use their good offices on his behalf in a dispute with a foreign Power, and say that His Majesty’s Government have most carefully gone into the whole history of the recent dispute, and can see no justification whatever for the harsh and aggressive action of the vali, especially in the attack on Zain, resulting in the death of a wife of the sheikh, and for the new decree forbidding him to registei land in the Bussorah vilayet, which seems to be contraiy to Ottoman law. If we ask for an apology, for the removal of the vali, or for compensation, we must maintain our demands should the Porte refuse compliance. We are not bound to do more than use our good offices, but if this fails and we do not insist if necessary, by threat of force—should we then not lose prestige with the sheikh, or would our intervention reassure him, even if the result were not satisfactory at any rate, at once . What, in your view, is the minimum for which we could ask, in view of the fact that j we are now ready to give the new assurance, and are advising the King to confer the j K.C.I.E. ?

I submit that contents completely vindicate sheikh, at least as regards | bombardment of Zain by Vali of Bussorah. Sheikh acted throughout with moderation, and was entirely guided by advice of British consular officers. I therefore see no reason against bestowal of decoration and assurances. Case against vali as presented by His Majesty’s consul-general is very strong. Vali is clearly hostile to our interests in the Gulf, and I share consul-general’s difficulty in understanding how his presence makes for security on river, for it was probably the sheikh’s correct and patient attitude which alone averted serious Arab rising consequent upon vali’s behaviour. But, in view of possibility of vali’s action being due to orders from Constantinople, perhaps His Majesty’s Government will be unwilling to risk precipitating the raising of graver questions by pressing for his removal. Despatch follows. (Addressed to Foreign Office, No. 346 ; repeated to Bushire.) s0 s No. 116 of 1910. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT * m. SECRET. External. To The Right Hobble VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, With reference to the correspondence ending with Your Lordship’s telegram of the 31st May 1910, we have the honour to forward herewith the correspondence detailed in the annexed schedule, relative to the friction which has recently arisen between the Turkish authorities on the Shatt-el-Arab and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. 2. On a review of the papers, we are of opinion that the aggressive pro ceedings of the Wali of Basrah were unjustified, and that the Sheikh of Mohammerah acted throughout the crisis not only with moderation but with much prudence and foresight. At the initial stage of the imbroglio, he endeavoured to placate the Wali of Basrah by seeking an interview with a view to an amicable settlement, and, on receiving a rebuff, wisely withdrew to Ahwaz, averting an armed conflict with the Turks and maintaining a calm attitude before his tribesmen whose indignation had been roused by the Wali’s action. This pacific attitude of the Sheikh, under British advice, despite the bombardment of Zain, the shelling of his mother’s house, the accusations brought against him, and the offensive circular promulgated by the Wali, is greatly to the Sheikh’s credit, and constitutes a strong claim to the support of His Majesty’s Government. 3. It is undeniable that in this corner of the Shah’s dominions, important alike strategically, politically and commercially, the authority of the Central Government is almost non-existent, and that, while in other parts of Persia chronic unrest has prevailed, peace has been maintained in and around Moham merah by the wise administration of the Sheikh, whose assistance the Persian Government quite recently invoked to establish order in the portions in the North outside his jurisdiction. The trade of the country through the southern ports has been seriously dislocated, and were the Sheikh to become ill-disposed consequent on our failure to afford him adequate support in connection with the present incident, various British enterprises on the Karun and in South-West Persia would be seriously hampered. But the result of failure to support the Sheikh heartily to obtain honourable terms in this dispute will not be limited to Mohammerah alone. There are not wanting indi cations that the Wali’s action at Mohammerah was a ballon d'essai, and that unless^ his proceedings are discredited, Turkish activity will extend to Koweit, Bahrein and along the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, as also to the southern portion of the Turco-Persian boundary, endangering the stability of Simla, the 11th August 1910. My Lord, British influence and prestige throughout the region mentioned.2 4. We trust that His Majesty’s Government will be in accord with our view, and will make a strong representation to the Turkish Government on behalf of the Sheikh, whose good-will is essential to the maintenance of British interests in the Karun region, and we would earnestly invite attention to the hope expressed by Colonel Cox in the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 3 of f J his letter No. 40—1607, dated the 16th June 1910, that it may be possible to enunciate some common lines of policy for the guidance of His Majesty’s Consuls at Basrah and Mohammerah, by the joint pursuit of which they will he able to keep the Turkish authorities and the Sheikh of Mohammerah within constitutional bounds, and, by so doing, jointly safeguard our position and great interests at the head of the Gulf.

CROW, His Majesty's Consul,2 , ym WII mp No. 22. Sir, Basrah, April 23rd, igio. As a result of the good understanding between the Wali of Basrah and Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah, the latter, some three months ago, promised to aid the Turkish authorities to preserve the peace in this Vilayet, and to hand over criminals from Turkish territory who sought refuge in the Sheikh’s domains Khazal also undertook not to let disturbers of the peace cross the river to Turkey. Last month robbers attacked a house at Manawi, a village close to this Consulate. It was reported to the authorities that one of the servants was a servant of Mirza Hamza, the Sheikh’s Agent at Basrah, that he had fled to Mohammerah, and that the Sheikh declined to give him up. On April 2nd Kassim Chelmeran, proprietor of the local newspaper “ Idhar-el-Haq ”, was killed by his labourers at Ajarawiyah, a few miles below this Consulate, on the opposite side of the river, in Turkish territory, and the murderers sought refuge at Mohammerah. These people were not handed over to the Turkish authorities. Besides this, it is reported that there are many criminals, fugitives from justice,' at Mohammerah, and when Sheikh Khazal is asked to give them up, he denies their presence there. We had similar grounds of complaint against the authorities at Mohammerah in connection with the Maghil case, and the murder of Mr. Glanville in 1906 , as Your Excellency will see from the correspondence on the subject. Last month Muhammad Bey al Meshri applied to the Turkish authori ties in the usual way to remove certain fellah from his property at Dowasir. The authorities tried to carry out the orders given for their removal, but without suc cess, and the trespassers were supported in their opposition to the local autho rities by one Muhammad al Chanan, who with the followers lives at Zain on Tur kish territory. d he Wali sent the Tabur Agassi with 15 gendarmes to arrest Muhammad al Chanan. This they were not able to do, and were informed in answer to their demands, that all the people there belonged to Sheikh Khazal and were unable to come to Basrah, and if the arrest were insisted on, the Agent of Muhammad Bey al Meshri at Dowasir would be killed in the same manner as Kassim Chelmeran. The Tabur Agassi returned to Basrah, and informed the Wah accordingly.^ Muhammad al Chanan seems to have applied to Sheikh Khazal for protection, and when the latter was requested by the Wali to hand Chanan over as he was an Ottoman subject residing on Turkish territory, the Sheikh refused to do so, contending that the man belonged to him. On April 18th, however, Sheikh Khazal brought up Muhammad Chanan with him in his yacht as a guest to Basrah and wished to call on the Wali with him to discuss ft But , the u W l all u refu J se , d t0 see either Kh ^I °r Chanan, and demanded that the la ter should be_handed over in the usual way, and if this were done he would be pleased to receive the Sheikh. Sheikh Khazal then returned to Moham- merah with his guest and relations with Basrah are somewhat strained in conse- quence, Mirza Humza left shortly after for Mohammerah. In conversation with me the Wali said he had no intention of giving way 'VarmTrk * r ; ^7 ' th ?. S ^ lk jl dl . d . ' ot co .ncede his demands he would send the Marmaris to Zain, which is Turkish territory, to demonstrate, and, if neces sary, punish Chanan and his retainers for their resistance to his demands. thomnahl,^ 11 r id . h an- ad S0 2 e ?PP ortunit y of studying Sheikh Khazal and ATef on f L d T u d c' S ! nfluenc f' vas as a landowner and a tribal of hi villi T L S, , d t°u f t !l e j ,ver ’ and he thou g h t that most of the Mughtars of th village from Abul Khasib down were in his pay or pledged to his interests.

CROW, Bts Britannic Majesty's Consul, Basrah*MOHAMMERAH; % My dear Crow, I have to thank you for sending me a copy of your No. 22 to Constantino ple on the subject of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Wali. I am sending a copy to the Resident in Bushire, and have little doubt that the latter will mention the matter to the Sheikh when he comes up here, as is expected shortly. ******* As regards the Wall’s claim to jurisdiction over Muhammad Chanan, I ought to point out that he is the Chief of one of the principal tribes of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, from whom the latter derives much of his strength, influence and revenue. He is, I believe, undoubtedly a Persian subject born and bred in Persia, and only transferred to his present abode within the last decade, after a chequered career in other parts of Arabistan. I am obtaining more definite information on the subject. For the Sheikh to hand over such a man to the Turkish authorities is unprecedented, and difficult in the extreme, and you could perhaps suggest this point to the Wali, if opportunity offers; it is not a case of surrendering an ordinary malefactor, but a headman of the most powerful tribe in the district of Mohammerah. Haji Athbi is another important tribal leader domiciled in Turkey in Umm- ur-Rassas, but undoubtedly in my belief a Persian subject, as he has only recently moved there, with most of his men, and, in any case, he and his tribe have always been recognised as Persian subjects, and have always fought for the Sheikh in his wars. For the precise position of the houses of the two men, please see my map of the Shatt-ehArab, sent to you in December. I understand that Persia and Turkey have their own arrangements regarding jurisdiction and extradition, but, whether this is the case or not, I venture to think that the Wali would do well to recognise that the case of Muhammad Chanan is not on all fours with other cases of extradition of criminals, in which he has had reason to complain. This of course with no prejudice to the rights and wrongs of the general question. Muhammad Chanan and Haji Athbi are members of the tribal council which meets at Failiyah, and were amongst the eight tribal leaders who signed the agreement between the Sheikh and the Oil Company, with reference to the land required for refinery and pipe line. I hope to come to Basrah next Sunday and will discuss this question with you personally. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON. Basrah ; April idth, igio. My dear Crow, Please refer to my demi-official of the 24th instant on the subject of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Wali of Basrah. I left Basrah at mid-day on 25th, and at 1-30 P.M. passed the 'Marmaris” which was returning to Basrah. On my return to Mohammerah I learnt that at about midday the village of Muhammad Chanan in Zain, (Turkish territory), opposite Mohammerah, had been burnt and looted by Turkish soldiers, and that 10 shots had been fired from the ship’s guns. April 24th t igio.4 I saw Mirza Hamza and urged him to keep people quiet, and then went with Haji Mushir, son of Haji Rais, to view the damage and ascertain the real facts. It appears that about 40 Turkish soldiers were sent by land and an equal ^ number by river to Muhammad Chanan’s village, which they looted and burnt to the number of about 60 huts, some of which were quite unconnected with Muhammad Chanan. They did as much wanton damage as they could, burning planks, bellams, doors, etc. They then retired and shortly afterwards the gunboat opened fire, smashing down several date trees and doing some damage to the house, not of Muhammad Chanan, but of Haji Gulfidan, wife of the late Sheikh Haji Jabir and mother of the present Sheikh. I surmise, with what accuracy I cannot say, that the gunboat intended to fire on Muhammad Chanan’s house, but missed it and hit the house of the old lady, which is in the line of fire. His Excellency Sheikh Khazal is now in Ahwaz, but will, I expect, shortly return. 1 have wired to Colonel Cox giving him a brief account of what occurred. Mirza Hamza tells me that, on the 25th, soldiers from the “ Marmaris ” demanded the persons of Muhammad Chanan, Haji Athbi and Baraq bin Nafta, brother of Haji Arak. The second named is head of the Umm-ur-Rassas tribe which is tributary to the Sheikh. The third named is brother of another headman, and has always lived and had business exclusively on Persian soil. All three are, in my opinion, Persian subjects. Failing to get possession of these men, they yesterday imprisoned M’atuq bin Nafta, brother of Baraq and his son who are also, I believe, indisputably Persian subjects. I will defer for the present troubling you with an expression of view as to the political or legal aspect of the case. All I would remark is that the Wali’s action seems to me to be unjustifiable and highhanded, and not calculated to further the peace of the district, unless he is prepared to reinforce his present armaments. I am sending a copy of this letter to Bushire. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON. Telegram No. 404, dated the 25th April 1910. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah, via Borasjun, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Turkish Gunboat ' Marmaris ” to-day shelled and burnt village of Muhammad Chanan opposite Mohammerah in Turkish territory the property of Sheikh of Mohammerah. Damage done about £600. ^ Wali of Basrah did this, I am told, under orders from Constantinople as a punishment to the owner of the village who is head of one of the largest tribes of the Sheikh, because he refused to allow himself to be arrested by the Wali’s men, being a Persian subject, according to his own statement, which is I believe correct under international law, and, in any case, as head of Persian tribe he has always been recognised as such. No definite proof of misdoing has been adduced against him by Wall, who acted on hearsay and would not allow Sardar Arfa to intervene. # Moreover, gunboat has captured and imprisoned an important leader of Sheikh’s tribes for no known reason, and man is undoubtedly a Persian. Sheikh now in Ahwaz but will I expect come back. I have not left Mohammerah. Incident has caused great excitement and reprisals are probable. I have begged local authorities to keep quiet.

Sheikh has wired to Mirza Hamza, his Basrah Agent now in charge of Mohammerah telling him that he is to act strictly in accordance with whafever advice I give him, and also asked if it was desirable for him to leave Nasiri or not. . 1 ha y e adv,sed the S h eikh to leave Ahwaz for the present, as his hasty arrival will cause comment, and show that he is afraid of the actions of the Wali. . As regards settlement between the Sheikh and the Wali, l have advised the Sheikh’s Agent to go to Basrah shortly, and interview the Wali. To say that the whole question of the Wali’s action in burning the village turns on whether Muhammad Chanan is a Persian or a Turkish subject. If the former, the Wali is not justified, if the latter, he is. He should suggest that the question of the nationality of Muhammad Chanan should be referred to some impartial and skilled person such as His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, so as to obtain an independent verdict. He should do nothing to give the Turks an excuse for further aggressive action, and should be conciliatory. He should consult His Majesty^s Consul at Basrah before acting. His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah reports that Turks are shortly bringing out 2 more gunboats. Copy by post to Basrah. No. 423, dated the 30th April 1910. Enclo. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward copies of the marginally noted correspondence on the subject of the action of the Turks ms a vis the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in continuation of my letter No. 412 of the 27th April 1910. Consul Basrah, to Consul, Mohammerah, No. 46 , dated 27th April 1910. Consul, Mohammerah, to Resident, Telegram No. 414 dated April 2Sth 1910. v 2. I beg to offer the following comments on Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 46, of April 27th. 3. The evidence that is available here tends to show that Muhammad Chanan is, according to international law, a Persian subject. 4. Although it is no doubt true that the Turks have not been able to exact redress in the past, it is equally true for the same reason, that they have been wholly unable to keep order on their side of the river and in Basrah, and the Sheikh has had frequent cause to complain of this. It has always been a conve nient excuse for the Turkish subordinate officials to report that the criminal in question had fled to Mohammerah; it is known that ifacilities for so doing were not infrequently afforded them by the said officials. 5. The question of the frontier, so far as it affects Failiyah, raised by the Wali, is dealt with in my letter to you, No. 255, of 12th March 1910. 6. Minawi and Ajrawiyah (mentioned in His Majesty’s Consul Basrah’s Despatch No. 22 of 23rd April) are in Turkish territory, close to Basrah and there is not, I believe, the slightest evidence, beyond the interested assertions of the Basrah Police, to show that the crimes there are in any way connected with Mohammerah. Mirza Hamza assures me most definitely that the murderer is at present in Turkish territory in Diaji, and that the Basrah police are afraid, to apprehend him.7. The case of Muhammad Meshri, also mentioned in the despatch above quoted, has another aspect. The removal of “ fallahs in the usual way ” is a euphemism for an attempt, on the part of the Turks, to oust the tenants of certain lands (alleged to be Persian subjects), without reference to the Turkish courts ot law, in favour of the Turkish owner. It is not stated who gave the message to the Tabur Agassi that Meshri would be killed in the same way as Chamaran, if the arrest of Muhammad Chanan were insisted on. Itjs strenuously denied here and seems inherently improbable that Muhammad Chanan, or his men, would have been so foolish to utter such a threat to 15 armed gendarmes on Turkish soil. The story is not unlikely to be a fabrication on the part of Turkish subordinate officials with the object of causing trouble between the Sheikh and the Wali. 8. The Wall’s demands that Muhammad Chanan be handed over, and his refusal to even discuss the matter with Sheikh Khazal seems to be arbitrary and unjustifiable. As headman and hereditary leader of one of the Sheikh’s tribes, it is impossible for the Sheikh to hand over him to the Wali without incurring the hostility of a powerful section of the tribes who uphold him. Basrah ; April igio. No. 46. My dear Wilson, I have your letter of this evening. A list of about 25 people was sent to the Sheikh giving names of persons wanted for various matters connected with troubles on the river in Turkey. The Wali could not tell me anything against Haji Athbi and did not seem to know the name, but said that the cases of the persons asked for would be dealt with judicially if surrendered. I told him it might be extremely difficult for the Sheikh, as an Arab, to surrender either Chanan or Athbi, who were Chiefs of some of his most powerful tribes, as such a surrender would be contrary to Arab customs and tribal rules. The Wali said Chanan was an Ottoman subject, resident in Turkey, and, even if he were not an Ottoman subject, he was concerned in past troubles on the river. The Turks hitherto had not been able to exact redress, but that time was over. The Sheikh, in years past, had frequently been asked to restrain his adherents from disturbing the peace of the Vilayet. He had not done so. As he protected these people and refused to surrender them, the Wali said he had no choice in the latter but to take his own measures. My impression is that the Wali is acting on instructions from Constantinople, and I hear that he wired after refusing the Sheikh when the latter brought up Chanan to Basrah. I do not think anything fresh is contemplated at present unless the Sheikh gives cause by raising his tribes and creating trouble. In that case the Turks might move against Failiyah or destroy some of the Sheikh’s property in Basrah^ I notice that they pulled down part of a new house which the Sheikh is erecting on the Asshar creek, near the brigade, but they did not do much damage, and the proceedings were stopped, I hear, by the Wali in person. At the same time they pulled down part of Khaderi’s new house (unfinished) a little lower down, but I do not attach much importance to these incidents. The Wali spontaneously told me that the Sheikh’s house at Failiyah, which he called 1 Persian yildiz ” was, strictly speaking, situated in Turkey, according to the line of demarcation laid down by the Commission. He seems to have learned this from Constantinople. The Turkish officials are childishly exultant over the Zain affair, and matters must rest a while till they are cooler. ^ There have been no troubles on the river as far as I know except the recent affairs at Ajariwiyah and Minawaiand Chibasi, but, according to my reports to the Embassay, there is a heavy cumulative record against Mohammerah from7 f September 1908, to March 31, 1909 and most of the offenders were traceable to your district. Apart from this, I have, in previous years, repeatedly called the attention of our Government to the attitude of the Sheikh in regard to river troubles generally, and to disturbance in Basrah in particular. On one occasion, during the hunt for Glanville’s murderers in 1906 and 1907, representations were made at my instance to the Sheikh through Tehran. To the best of my recoil- lection the Sheikh took the matter lightly. My efforts to get the Sheikh to co-operate with the Turks and aid them to suppress lawlessness have been un availing. The day of reckoning seems to have come, and I think it is high time the Turks took up the matter themselves. Their action may be arbitrary, but if they have the force to carry it through, and I shall ask the Embassy to press for supply of proper means, it will, I am sure, in the end be salutary as far as this Vilayet is concerned.

My dear Colonel Cox, In continuation of my letter No. 423 of even date, I enclose a copy of a demi- official letter which I have just received from His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, on the subject of the trouble between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Wali, and my reply. The departure of the Wali to Baghdad is very fortunate and will minimise the likelihood of any further troubles in the immediate future; the Sheikh has assur ed me, through Mirza Hamza, that he will take no measures of any kind which might be treated as reprisals ; this is in accordance with the advice I gave him in the first instance. Mr. Crow’s letter enclosed refers to an interview that he had with Haji Mushir, son of Haji Rais, at my suggestion. I did not, however, at any time, mention the question of guarantee for the Sheikh’s Basrah property, and quite agree with Crow that he should get it through the Persian Embassy, or else from the Wali.

I do not think the Wali is at all likely to do them harm. But I cannot answer for developments, and they might be expos ed to annoyance and supervision. As regards Persian property in Basrah, I would advise the Sheikh to get his guarantee through the Persian Embassy; the difficulty will probably be discussed between them and the Porte, and any local promise I might give would be easily overruled.

In explanation of the general question of the Sheikh’s influence and interest in Turkish territory, I would point out that more than half the Arabs occupying the date groves on the Western (Turkish) bank of the Shatt-el-Arab „e ong to tribes which have been for the last hundred years subject to theSheikh of Mohammerah. The numerous islands in the river are occupied almost solely by his tribes, and, of the 8 headmen who signed the Agreement between the^ Sheikh and the Oil Company relating to Abadan Island, 4 live in Turkish territory, though they are undoubtedly Persian subjects, born, like their fathers, on Persian soil. 4. Hitherto no Wali of Basrah has attempted to raise the question of nationality, and I am informed by Mirza Hamza, the Sheikh’s Basrah Agent, that the Persian nationality of such tribesmen was explicitly recognised by the Turks and formally recorded in the Government books. e The present Wali, Sulaiman Nathif, has confined himself to the mere as sertion that Muhammad Chanan, whom he sought to arrest, was a Turkish sub ject, and refused to discuss the question with Sheikh Khaz*al or his agent in any way, until Muhammed Chanan had been handed over to him for punishment. 5. This man is the head of the largest and most powerful of the tribes under the direct control of the Sheikh, and is the latter’s brother-in-law. He has some 4,000 riflemen at his disposal in case of war, and provided some 2.000 to the Sheikh in 1908, when the latter, with the authority of the Persian Govern ment, was engaged in subduing the turbulent tribes of Hawaizeh. His surrender, in any case, therefore, would be a practical impossibility for the Sheikh, and would alienate from the latter a large section of his tribesmen. He has not, moreover, been accused of any definite crime, and there is no reason, as far as I am aware, to think that he has been in any way concerned in Crime or intrigues for some time past. On the contrary, for the last eighteen months the Shatt-el-Arab has been unprecedentedly quiet, and no outrages attri butable in any way to the Sheikh’s tribesmen have occurred. 6. Until the middle of last month, the Wali’s relations with Sheikh Khaz’al were extremely cordial, and the latter had not the slightest idea that the former contemplated breaking with him suddenly and shelling his brother-in-law’s village, bombarding his mother’s house and ruining the Sheikh’s personal property, on so flimsy a pretext. That he did so under orders from Constantinople, is, 1 believe, certain, and it is worthy of note that his action coincided with the arrival of Nazim Pasha in Baghdad, accompanied by reinforcements of Turkish troops. 7. Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 22, of the 23rd April, enclosed herewith, indicates the gist of the Wali’s complaints, which he alleges to be the ground for his present action. I have made careful enquiry in regard to them, and can find no ground whatever for the Wali’s definite assertions on the subject of the shelter given to criminals in Mohammerah. There is, on the contrary, a strong consensus of opinion that the murderers and criminals are residents of Basrah, and are still in Turkish territory, and that the Turkish police assert that they have fled across the boundary in order to justify their inability to catch them. 8. The Sheikh has, in general, afforded every assistance to the Turkish authorities in the apprehension of criminals, but, in past times, he has been considerably discouraged by the fact that such persons alw r ays escaped or were released by the Turks after a short time, and by the fact that no justice was ever obtainable in the Turkish criminal courts {vide enclosures 6 and 7). He is not yet satisfied that there has been any substantial change in this respect. 9. The action of the Wali in shelling and burning the village of Muhammad Chanan in the district of Zain, the personal property of Sheikh Khaz’al, seems to me to be unjustified from every point, of view, and the official statement in the Basrah newspaper (enclosure No. 3) only confirms this opinion. It is unfortu nate too that, whether by accident or design, the gunboat shelled and damaged, without warning, the house of the Sheikh’s mother, close by, nearly frightening the old lady out of her wits. It is still more unfortunate that one of the Sheikh’s wives, and sister of Muhammad Chanan, who was in the latter’s village at the time, has since died of shock consequent on the bombardment. These incidents have inflamed local opinion against the Turks. 26to There is no indication at present that the Wali intends to raise the nnestion of the Turko-Persian boundary in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and it is to be hoped that he will not do so. I have addressed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf separately on this subject in my letter No. 255 of 12th March 1910. In connection with the general questions pending between the Wali and the Sheikh 1 would invite a reference to the map of the Shatt-el-Arab on the 1 mile = 1 inch scale copies of which were forwarded to Sir George Barclay under my No. 119-43 of 18th September, and also to the Foreign Office. 12. From the tenour of the Wall’s letters to the Persian Consul in Basrah (enclosures No. 1 and 2) it appears that he proposes to take forcible measures to enforce compliance with his demands, which are of very questionable legality. 1 q Mr Crow has ascertained from His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople that Persia claims the same rights in Turkey for her subjects, under^ Article 1 of their Convention of 1875, as other Powers enjoy under the Capitulations, but this claim is nor. admitted by Turkey. Further, that Turkey cannot legally demand from the Persian Government the extradition of Turkish subjects accused on criminal offences who take refuge in Persian territory. b nendly arrangements for the extradition of criminals have, however, been in force for many years between successive Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Walls of Basrah, and it is upon such mutual arrangements that the Wali must rely. 14. Under instructions from Constantinople, Mr. ^ Crow has ^ already commenced negotiations with the Wali with a view to arriving at a satisfactory settlement. The decision quoted in the foregoing paragraph will be °f great assistance to him, as it shows that the Wali has no legal right for his action. Haji Rais, the Sheikh’s confidential agent, has also gone to Basrah to interview Mr. Crow, and endeavour to find a basis for settlement that could be accepted by both sides. 15. The Wali, by his precipitate action, has placed himself in the wrong, and has so far made no serious allegations against the Sheikh, nor submitted any proofs in respect of such allegations as he has made. The Sheikh is the aggrieved party in the matter, and I sincerely trust that he will receive reasonable satisfaction as an outcome of the negotiations. 16. Mr. Crow has been informed by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that there is no present intention of appointing a Turkish Consul to Mohammerah, and no provision has been made for such a post in the Budget. The proposal appears to have been put forward by the Wali about 2 months ago, but shelved for the present by the Porte. 17. The greater part of the contents of this despatch and of its enclosures has, no doubt, reached you telegraphically. I have, however, ventured to submit translations of the original documents, together with a report on tfm situation, in the hope that it may not be wholly without interest by the time it reaches Tehran. 18.

We cannot naturally disregard the fact that Sheikh Khaz’al Khan of Mohammerah protects a lot of malefactors and now and then lets them attack Basrah town and neighbourhood, and that this disturbs the peace of the Vilayet. It is evident that, at a moment when both sides are endeavouring to strengthen and maintain the friendly relations which have from old times existed between Persia and Turkey, actions which will disturb these relations will be viewed by your experienced self too with regret. I have, therefore, the honour to inform you that you should make the necessary communications, and to say that, if attacks occur again, the Ottoman Government will be obliged to assure local security by protecting its lawful rights with the official forces at its disposal.

The gunboat “ Marmaris ” was therefore, sent with troops under the Com mandant and the Mutassarif of Nejd and other officials to Zain to arrest the said Muhammad Chanan.

It is also certain that the authors of many crimes, murders and robberies committed in the Sanjak of Basrah are concealed by him. It is most essential that, apart from the lawful authority of the Ottoman Government, no foreign power should exercise influence in the Ottoman dominions and that the application and enforcement of Ottoman laws and justice should not be impeded or delayed by any extraneous influence or interest. It is a most important duty incumbent on the officers of the Government to break and destroy the unlawful influence in Turkish territory of such a person who,’profiting by the improvidence of past times, is a source of calamity to his own country, and even ventures to harbour malefactors to the detriment of the Imperial Government. You are, therefore, definitely instructed to remove all Mukhtiars who may be dependent on Sheikh Khaz’al, and to replace them by honest patriotic persons, and to allow him by no means or possibility to exercise influence in your district.

Sir, Basrah; March ioth } igog. inllS! ^ ‘ he 3rd instant from ConstantinopleThe disturbances reported in my telegrams of February 13th, 25th, 26th, and March 2nd, ceased on receipt of this news. The connection is interesting and instructive, and, in view of the Grand Vizier’s replies to Your Excellency, of February 24th and March 1st, which seem to me disingenuous and are certainly misleading, I think it as well to place on record the probable cause of these sporadic out-breaks, which occur here at stated intervals, whenever the Wali of Basrah is unfortunate or tactless enough to annoy his influential neighbours and incur their resentment. However much the Arabs in these districts fight between themselves, there is always sufficient solidarity among them to join in harassing their common enemy the Turks, if necessity arises and the opportunity is favourable. We have too many instances of this to admit of denial, but it may be sufficient to note that, some years ago, before Mubarak murdered his brothers and seized Koweit, and Khazal of Mohammareh did the same, it was a well established custom for the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah, and the Nakib of Basrah to combine in organizing armed attacks on the inhabitants of the Shatt-el-Arab and the neighbourhood, or in undertaking piratical enterprises at the bar or in the river. Eye witnesses still relate that it was no uncommon sight to see as many as thirty boat loads of armed men leaving Mohammerah after the time of evening prayer to carry out the hostile designs of this powerful triumvirate, who employed their own servants and retainers for the purpose, and shared the spoil among them. I think we should be incorrect in presuming that this custom has entirely died out. For the past six years, while I have been here, crime has been very frequent in Basrah, while disturbances, similar to those which occur in the districts administered by Turkey, are unknown in Mohammerah and Koweit. It is not necessary to recapitulate events, those of unusual gravity have been reported as they occurred to His Majesty’s Embassy, and are on record already. I have always understood that the present Sheikh of Koweit is no longer a party to the system. He indulges in Arab forays and razzias instead, and has, perhaps, a wider field of activity, and his position, moreover, has no doubt been modified by recent circumstances. But, as regards the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Nakib of Basrah, who are still surrounded by followers of the most ruffianly description, I believe this not to be the case. It is at least noticeable that, on each occasion, when disturbances break out in the neighbourhood of Basrah, they have been invariably preceded by some quarrel or disagreement between the Wali of Basrah and his powerful neighbours on points closely affecting the interests of the latter. And, when arguments have failed, the Turkish districts are harried by armed gangs, who plunder, murder_ and commit all manner of excesses with impunity until the object of the injured party is achieved and the unpopular Governor discredited and removed. The attitude adopted by the ex-Wali in regard to the registration of land transfers has affected the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit very closely. The former owns a great deal of land and house property in Basrah, and draws considerable revenues therefrom. The Wali, I am informed, raised the same objection to his acquiring new property, as he did in the registration of Fedaghia, and the land purchased from Sheikh Sadun of Muntafik in the name of the Sheikh of Koweit. It is a well established fact that some, if not all, of the band who committed the outrage reported in my telegram No. 10 of 13th February last came from and returned to Mohammerah. The same thing occurred in 1906, in the Maaghil case. Several of the culprits were traced to Mohammerah, and when pressure was ultimately brought to bear on the Sheikh to hand them over, we had reason to doubt whether the persons delivered were those concerned in the murder of Mr. Glanville. There were others, of course, caught on Turkish territory, but, as regards those known to be at Mohammerah, the Sheikh’s attitude was evasive and unsatisfactory. It is to be hoped that the new Wali will prove himself to be a stronger man than his predecessor. We had remarkable proof of what a strong Governor could do when Fahkri Pasha was sent here in 1904, after disturbances had reached a climax in the time of Mustapha Noun Pasha, Wall of Basrah. If extended powers are given to the new Wali, much can no doubt be done to 3°11 H mitigate the evil. But, as long as action is confined to mere perfunctory police enquiries, and reference is made to a so-called Criminal Court, where no justice i obtainable, while local authorities are allowed to throw dust in- our eyes bv arresting innocent persons and sentencing them to expiate the offences of guilty defaulters, the lawless condition of Basrah will not improve.

Majesty's Embassy, Constantinople, by No. 36, of 14th May 1910. Mr. F. E. Crow, His Majesty’s Consul at , , c , , Basrah, on the subject of the difficulties between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Wali of Basrah, and of the result o negotiations between the two parties, together with a telegram on the subject ot the rules regarding extradition in force between Turkey and Persia. 2. I can add littie to Mr. Crow s statement of the case, which seems to me m the main, to represent the facts of the case from an impartial standpoint. . 3 - I think that the harbouring of bad characters by the Sheikh is not so serious an evn or so deliberate a piece of mischief on the part of the Sheikh as the Turks make out. It has been the policy of the Sheikh, like all other Arab Chiefs, to take such persons into his service, pay them, clothe and feed them, and thus keep them under surveillance and out of mischief, whilst at the same time securing for himself an efficient bodyguard. It is only when the Sheikh has been stirred to indignation by the inaptitudes of certain Walis that he has connived at the perpetration of outrages by such persons, with the object (usually successful) of securing the removal of the Wali, or the cessation of the practices objected to. 4. Nor can it be assumed that the Sheikh is generally cognizant of out rages committed by his subjects. The reverse is ti e case. The latter, living in Turkish territory, have hitherto been emboldened to commit depredations by the knowledge that the Turkish ^ police were not likely to disturb their opera tions, and that subsequent punishment was not likely to follow. They only occasionally bothered to take refuge in Mohammerah, being safe in Basrah, a larger town, where they would not be known personally. 5. The proofs of the Persian nationality of Muhammad Chanan, which have been submitted to me by the local authorities, have satisfied me that he is a Persian subject according to international law, but this point has now ceased to have more than academic importance. 6. The settlement that has now been reached between the Sheikh and the • (Will follow by next post.) Wali is shown by the enclosure* to Mr. Crows despatch No. 26, of the 14th May. It takes the form of a letter from the Turkish authorities to the Sheikh, in which the latter set forth their case against the Sheikh in brief and polite, but forcible language, and announce their willingness to be friends wuth him if he will under take to surrender fugitives, and prevent his tribesmen from causing trouble in Turkish territory. Something less than justice is done to the Sheikh by this form of settlement which is entirely in favour of the Turks. But this must be accepted as inevitable since they are, owing to Persia’s weakness, now predominant on the river, and preparing to make good their claim33 to exercise sovereign territorial rights in the Shatt-el-Arab, which they regard as the territorial waters of the Ottoman Empire, to which Persian vessels have access only by virtue of the special clause in the Treaty of Erzeroum. 7. I hope to see the Sheikh shortly, and shall urge on him the necessity of f accepting the settlement, unsatisfactory though it may be, and of endeavouring to cultivate cordial relations with the Turks afresh. In the words of Mr. Crow, he must modernize his ideas with regard to them, and realize that the change of rdgime, in Turkey, has brought about radical changes to which he must accom modate himself. I trust that the Turks on their part will not again be^ so precipitate in their action should they have any cause of complaint, real or imaginary, against him.

Sir, Your Excellency’s telegram of May 3rd reached me on May 4th, and I at once sent word to Basrah to the Mutassarif of Hassa, Saad Bey, who is acting in the absence of the Vali at Amara, that I wished to see him. He received me in the morning of May 5th, and I reported the result to Your Excellency in my tele gram No. 21. I said His Majesty’s Government regretted the action of the Vali, and feared it might lead to serious frontier questions, and open up other compli cations, that I had been instructed to help them make peace, and that peace must be made, as His Majesty’s Government attached great importance to it. Our _ , mutual friendship with both parties was of old standing, and the bheikh governed his own country well in comparison to the rest of Persia; we had important interests there, and did not want him weakened in Arabistan. I said I was sure it was possible to arrange for policing the country better, and I thought the Vali was rather “ vif,” and should have given us an opportunity to intervene before pro ceeding to extremities. The Acting Vali said I was not ignorant of their diffi culties with the Sheikh, and he mentioned his habit of conniving at, or instigating, disorder in the Vilayet, and then secreting the criminals. I said I was well aware of them after seven years residence in the country, but the policy of His Majesty’s Government was to keep the two parties on good terms in the general interest, and in our own, in view of future commercial developments in Arabistan, and to weaken the Sheikh there would be detrimental to us. I impressed on him the absolute necessity of settling the dispute with the Sheikh in a friendly way, either directly or through me, and he said he preferred to have us in it, as, it the Sheikh did not keep quiet after this, Turkey would have grounds of complaints against us. I said l would ask if influence could be brought to bear on the Sheikh to restrain him, and he replied that something of that sort would have to be done. I did not use the threat of reconsideration of the frontier, or of an appeal from the Sheikh to our assurances, as he seemed inclined to bend to gentler arguments, and I preferred to have something in hand incase the Vali should prove obstinate. Saad Bey promised to do his best and to tell the Vali tne question was important, and that we were not merely bluffing, and I generally gave him to understand that there was considerably more behind, which 1 did not wish to worry him with as long as he realised what was wanted. He said he quite understood, and had followed oui Gulf policy for some years while at Cairo. I think he said he was there for many years. I suggested Haji Reiss as an inter mediary as Mirza Hamza was not, I knew, &amp; persona grata with the Vali.34 Lieutenant Wilson came up from Mobammerah the same evening with Haji Reiss, and the latter arranged to see the Acting Vali on the following day, May 6th and to inform me of the result. I had a long interview with Haji Reiss on the evening of May 6th after he had seen Saad Bey. He took a very diplo matic line with him and said that, if the Vali was all fire, he would be all water. I thought the result of the interview, as he related it to me, was as satisfactory as could be expected in the preliminary stages of peace making. Saad Bey after wards summoned the Vali to the Telegraph office, and was in communication with him yesterday afternoon. Haji Reiss is to lunch with the Acting Vali to day to hear the result, and will see me later. His report will be too late for this mail. Haji Reiss said one thing to the Acting Vali which I thoroughly endorse. In fact I intended to use the same argument with the Vali myself if called upon to discuss the matter with him. It was to the effect that, if the Turks had any grievance against Chanan, who was living on Turkish territory, let them tell the Sheikh that they refused to have him in the country, and the Sheikh would expel him from his lands at Zein and put another person in his place, which would be a punishment for Chanan, and the Turks would be rid of a knave. This is, l think, a very sound argument, and we might work upon these lines. I repeated the substance of my interview with Haji Reiss in my telegram No. 22. I drew his attention to the absolute necessity of getting the Sheikh to modernise his views on the subject of border relations, and of aiding him to realise the genuineness of Turkey’s wish for reform. The truth is the Turks have hitherto played such a pitiable part here, that it is not strange the Arabs should think no good can come from them. I said some arrangement would have to be made and adhered to for the surrender of criminals who evaded justice. He replied that the Turks could not keep them when they got them. There is truth in that. Evasions from prison used to be frequent, and once, in the Maghil case, I had Khuleyf brought up from Mohammerah and turned loose in a garden and sent 15 zapties, my dragoman and the Tabour Abassi to catch him, and they let him slip through their hands. I mentioned the attacks on Abul Khassik in 1908, and on Basrah, 1909, and the Sheikh’s pranks during Moharrem Bey’s gover« norship, which, sometimes, almost partook of the character of a Florentine “ beffa ” of the middle ages. Haji Reiss could not deny that the Sheikh was somewhat given to wreak his vengeance on any particular Vali he disliked by stirring up trouble in the Vilayet in order to discredit him. I pointed out what wretched tactics these were besides being very unfair on the sufferers, and Haji Reiss agreed and promised to offer better counsels. I understand the Sheikh is very much in the hands of his advisers, and I believe Haji Reiss is one of the best of them. For my own part, I rather distrust Mirza Hamza. Matters are somewhat complicated by two letters which the Vali addressed to the Persian Consul-General on April 26th, of which Haji Reiss gave me copies in Turkish. I enclose a literal translation of them. From these it will be seen that the Vali accuses the Sheikh of harbouring bad characters to the detriment of the Vilayet, and this is, I think, strictly true. He states further that he will use the force at his command to protect Ottoman territory against interference from the Sheikh. Tuikish officials under the new regime seem to me half intoxicated with liberty and dazed with the accession of power, and, like school boys out for a holiday, they may make sad misuse of it. An impetuous man like Nazif Bey requires a good deal of holding. He has his points, he is no liar and is clean handed, but he is not a very experienced Governor, and is most undiplo matic in his methods. In the second letter to the Persian Consul-General the Vali demands the arrest of Muhammad Chanan. I do not understand his allu sion to “ attacks on farms ” (bazi muqtelera tejavuz itmessi uzerine). As far as w r e know Chanan prevented the Zapties from turning out certain refractory “fellahs” from the land of a certain Mishri at Dowasir. He seems to have supported them because they were fellow clansmen and he went rather far, when the Tebour Agassi was sent to arrest him, Chanan, by saying that Nifhri’s agent would be killed if the arrest was insisted on. I have heard nothing else specified against him except the vague accusation that he is a brigand. Chanan, so Mr. Wilson informs me, is the headman of an important tribe subject to Sheikh35 Khazal, though the Turks claim him to be an Ottoman subject. I have so far received no proof of his Ottoman or Persian nationality. The Turks say they can prove their contention, and the Persians say the same. The only serious part of the Vali’s letter is the covert threat in the last sentence, in which he clearly menaces Mohammerah. I do not know how far he is acting on orders from Con stantinople in making this statement. A further complication is the death of one of the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s wives, a sister of Chanan, who resided with the Sheikh’s mother, Gulfidan, in the latter’s house at Zein, which was inadvertently bombarded by the Turks. The lady died of fright caused by the bombardment. Haji iteiss mentioned the matter to the Acting Vali out said they had no desire to press it. I have the honour, etc., F. E. CROW.

In reply to your enquiry I may say that, according to Article 1 of the Conven* tion between Turkey and Persia, dated 20th December 1 8y5, the Persian Govern ment claims a right to the same Capitulary treatment in criminal affairs as other Powers enjoy. The Turks, however, do not admit this right. There is, of course, no question of extradition in the case of a Persian subject who has found refuge in Persian Territory, and he would not be surrendered to Turkey. No provision has been made in the budget for a Turkish Consul at Moham merah, and there is no question of such an appointment. No. 50.

Basrah; May 14, 1910. on As reported in my telegram No. 2* of May 8th, Haji Reiss called on me, May 7th, after his interview with the Acting Vali, and informed me that the latter had shewn him the conversation, as recorded in the Telegraph office, between himself and the Vali. The Vali said he was glad to negotiate with Haji Reiss, that he wished no ill to the Sheikh personally, and did not want to offer him any indignity, but laid the whole blame on Mr. Crow to Acting VaU. ^ ^ Muhammad Chanan He said they were both Governors of their respective districts, and all he wanted from the Sheikhwas for him to keep his followers from causing disorders on Turkish territory, and not to conceal or protect criminals, Acting Vali to Mr. Crow, May 8. ^ escaped from Xurkey t0 Mohammerah, but to hand them over to justice. He wanted nothing more. This seems a reasonable attitude, and I told Haji Reiss so. He quite agreed and said the Persians were ready to do that. As reported in my telegram No. 24 of May 9th, the Vali emphasized his desire to effect a reconciliation with the Sheikh, without the intervention of a third party, meaning the Consulate. He also said he was willing to accept the Shaikh’s sole assurances in regard to the preservation of order and the surrender of criminals. Ha'i Reiss then told the Acting Vali that the Sheikh would carry out this undertaking as regards the future, and asked what the Turks required in regard to pending questions. 1. The Menawee incident. Three persons, out of six asked for by the Turks, were actually under arrest at Mohammerah and would be handed over, and they were looking for the others. 2. The murder of Chelmeran. The Persians regretted his death as much as the Turks, as he has been a friend of theirs and was useful to them, and, if the murderer, who is known, was in Arabistan, he would be arrested by the Sheikh and given up, or, if they ascertained that he was on Turkish territory, they would inform the Vali of his whereabouts. 3. The case of Muhammad Chanan. For reasons already stated the Sheikh could not surrender Chanan. The Acting Vali proposed, as a compromise, that the Sheikh should remove him from Zein and not jet him return to Turkey and appoint another agent in his place. Haji Reiss said that was all very well now but the Turks ought to have made that proposal before bombarding the Sheikh’s property. The Acting Vali admitted it would have been the better course. Haji Reiss said he would induce the Sheikh to agree to this solution, but he must consult him, and, in the meantime, the Acting Vali was to communi cate the proposal to the Vali for his approval. On May 8th Haji Reiss received private information that orders had reached Shamil Pasha, the military commandant at Basrah, to arrest him, and that he should at once return to Mohammerah as soldiers were already sent out to catch him. I said l did not believe the Turks were capable of such a breach of faith, but as a precaution, I would send a cavass with him when he went to the Acting Vah, and I gave him a letter, copy enclosed, to hand to the latter. It was after wards discovered that the information was merely given in order to frighten Haji Reiss away, and so break up the negotiation, and that there was no founda tion for it. Haji Reiss declined to give me the name of his informant but, as he had been calling on that morning Seyyed Tahb, who arrived by the Russian steamer “ Tigre ” on May 8th, I surmise the information must have come trom him- . . u t 1 Haji Reiss was very anxious I should say something specific to the Turks about the Sheikh’s assurances from the British Government. I told him I saw no advantage in using such an argument, at all events at present, and I said 1 gave the Acting Vali clearly to understand, in my interview with him on May stn, that His Majesty’s Government attached great importance to a settlement locally and feared complications if it were not effected, as we had considerable interests of a commercial nature in Arabistan. I added that the Turks were quite inte h- gent enough to perceive that the Sheikh himself was one of those interests, and that we were protecting him ipso facto by our intervention at the present juncture. It seemed a pitv, I said, to use a big nail, which might split the plank, when a tintack would do the work, Haji Reiss also consulted me as to what action the Persians should take in regard to the two official communications addressed by the Vali to the Persian Consul-General at Basrah on April 26ch, making direct accusations against the Sheikh, and covertly threatening to attack Moham- merah. I replied that my advice was to pigeonhole the letters and send no answer at all. I feared any reply might lead to an acrimonious correspondenceV 37 and upset our work of reconciliation. Haji Reiss promised me to advise the Persian Consul-General accordingly, and I understand a mere formal acknow ledgment will be sent. The Acting Vali informed Haji Reiss, on May 9th, that the Vali agreed to his proposal about Muhammad Chanan, whom the Sheikh will remove from lurkish territory appointing another agent in his place at Zein, that the questions between them were now settled in a friendly way and there was nothing more X he letter addressed to me by the Acting Vali on May 8th in reply to mine con tains assurances to that effect. A copy of the Acting Vali's letter is enclosed. . Haji Reiss replied that if all was now over, he would like him to write to the Sheikh to say so, and that their disagreement had been ended in an amicable manner between himself and the Acting Vali. The Acting Vali replied that the Sheikh should write first. Hap Reiss then produced from his bag a letter written and sealed by the Sheikh stating that he had sent Haji Reiss as his Plenipotentiary to settle matters, and handed it to the Acting Vali, adding that his instruc tions were to deliver the letter only if matters were settled in a satisfactory manner. The Acting Vali then agreed to give him his letter if he called tl i . he , a t f. rn0 ? J n ' , 0n Ha) 1 Reiss calling in the evening of the same day, Val, told him there was another question pending which must be settled before he wrote. It appears that, shortly after the Zein incident on April Isshak, an Arab presented a petition to the Vali to the effect that Hap Mustafa Mirza Hamza s head moonshee and an Ottoman subject, had Ih»m t n? ed - t0 h j m n l r n the P re f nce of witnesses.

Marling, Esq., C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran. In continuation of the telegraphic correspondence, I have the honour to submit, for your information, a copy of a communicationf (with enclosures, and my telegrams leading up to it) addressed to me by Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, His Majesty’s Acting Consul at Mohammerah in which, after personal communication with the Sheikh on the latter’s return from the Karun, he presents the Sheikh’s rejoinder to the Turkish allegations both particular and general. t'l) Telegram No. 467, dated 8th May 1910, from the Political Resident, Bushire, to riis Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah. &lt;2) Telegram No. 549, dated 25th May 1910. 13) Letter from His Majesty's Consul, Moham- merah. No. 560, dated 4th June 1910. 2. Before offering any observations on the contents of the report, I beg to touch upon certain salient points of the recent correspondence and negotiations. (i) Ihe basis of my own attitude .—The first news I had of there being any thing wrong between the Sheikh and the Wali of Basrah was contained in Lieu tenant Wilson’s telegram No. 404, received 26th April, in which the latter report ed the fact that Zain had been shelled bv the “ Marmaris ”. When I telegraphed to you on the 30th asking that His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, might be instruct ed to co-operate with Lieutenant Wilson in bringing about an amicable settlement, it was only the bombardment of Zain that I had knowledge of, and the amicable settlement which I advocated in regard to that incident was naturally meant to be one which would have regard to the Sheikh’s rights and interests as well as those of the Wali. It was not till later that I received news of the shelling of the Sheikh’s mother’s house; of the death of one of his wives from the shock of the bom bardment ; of the issue of the offensive circular of April 24th and of the des patch of the two letters to the Persian Consulate-General threatening measures against Mohammerah itself. In my eyes these additional items of news, and the possible further Turkish measures adumbrated by Mr. Crow, enhanced the hostile aspect of the Wall’s proceedings and the seriousness of the position to an extent which made an amicable local settlement not only unlikely, but also insufficient to meet the case, unless accompanied by a change of Walis. Accordingly, both on the Sheikh’s account and in our own interests, to which the tranquillity of the river at this season is a condition of the highest commercial t Basrah Despatch No. 36 of 8th May 1907, to importance, as His Majesty’s Consul, His Majesty’s Embassy. Basrah, fully recognises, J I recommended the despatch of one of His Majesty’s ships to the scene and efforts to bring aboutthe recall of the Wall. These recommendations, however, you felt unable to endorse, for the reasons stated in your telegrams Nos. 107, 112 and 116, and the incident has since been disposed of on other lines. (fV) The question as to whether the proceedings of Wali Suleiman Nazif Bey had justification or not % —l submit that, in order to arrive at a conclu sion on this point, it is not necessary or logical to look back further than the time of Nazif Bey’s assumption of his appointment, at the end of 1909 or begin ning of 1910 ; not necessary, really, to go back further than March 10th, 1910, the date of Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 14 to His Majesty’s Embassy. In the earlier part of this document we are told of the cordial foregathering of the Wali with the Shiekhs of Koweit and Mohammerah at the house of Abdul Wahab Pasha-el-Kurtass and of the banquet, speeches and photographs which followed ; and, while it may be quite true that the host, when delivering his post prandial pleasantries on this occasion, was speaking with his tongue in his cheek as Mr. Crow suggests—just as I fear he was when he expressed the valued opinion quoted in Basrah telegram of 9th instant to His Majesty’s Ambassador to the effect that the breach between the Sheikh and the Wali was healed—yet the contents of the last two paragraphs of the despatch are open to no such imputation of insincerity. In them we have an explicit statement from His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah to the effect that there had been no disturbance of importance on the river during the preceding winter; that Sheikh Khazal had -'quite recently been exercising his good offices in the endeavour to promote a reconciliation between an important riverain Turkish Arab Chief and the Wali; that the Sheikh had, in fact, been maintaining a generally conciliatory and co operative attitude towards IN azif Bey ever since the latter’s arrival; and that, in pursuit of this policy, he had endured with complacency the intermitent des truction of the house property in Basrah. I may mention too, apart from the above, that I was made aware, by the reports of His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, that the Sheikh had also been endeavouring to promote friendly relations between Nazif Bey and the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. This was the general position as between the Sheikh and the Wali when I rejoined my post from home on 31st March, and it appeared to me an eminent* ly satisfactory one. It was the same when I visited Mohammerah a week later. It seems to me, therefore, that, having regard to the happy terms which admittedly existed between the Sheikh and Wall when Mr. Crow wrote his despatch of of 10th March, all that we have to do, in order to gauge the morality of the Wall’s action, is to decide whether, subsequent to that date Sheikh Khazal was guilty of conduct which supplied the Wali with justification for such a sudden and complete change of attitude ; for his discourteous refusal to receive the Sheikh when the later went up to Basrah to visit him on 18th April • for the pro mulgation of his offensive circular of April 24th, and, finally, for the bombard ment of Zain on 25th. It seems to me that no such justification has yet been demonstrated. J In a recent telegram from His Majesty’s Secretary of State, dated 31st May, repeated to me by the Government of India, occurs the following pas sage :— &amp; r The telegram sent by Cox to Legation in answer to Mr. Marling’s tele- fu an cu -fb treats the rights and wrongs of the accusations against attitude 1 ’* 33 ° n ° aCC0Unt ’ but ls not P ossible to maintain this I think the telegram referred to must be my No. 543 sent in answer to your No. 123 to me. In it wrote that my attitude towards the action of the ah would be the same if the accusations against the Sheikh were well founded. If read by itself the sentence does convey the meaning above attributed to it, but trunk the full context indicates that it was not quite that attitude which I sought to take up My ? telegram to you was a reply to Basrah telegrams repeated by His Majesty s Embassy to London and to you, in which Mr. Crow had stated that Turkish grievances against the Sheikh were of long standing and serious, and that, to Ins knowJedge, the Sheikh had been a thorn in the flesh of the Vilayet for the last 7 years. It was those accusations, of the basisof which I had not full knowledge, which I had in mind when I wrote the said telegram to you, and my line of thought was that, even if they were proved to be well founded, it could not be said that they had anything to do with the Wali’s action in the present instance, which was a separate issue based on incidents subsequent to the date of Basrah Despatch No. 14 of 10th March, which, so far as could be seen from the reports of our officers, afforded no justification for the Wali’s sudden change of attitude towards the Sheikh. In fact, the unjus tifiability of the Wali’s proceedings, on the facts of which we were in possession, was a necessary premise to my attitude, both in this telegram and in my letter No. 569. (tit) The expediency of effecting Nazif Bey's recall. —As to the degree of difficulty involved to His Majesty's Embassy or Government in advising or urging the Porte to change a particular Wali, I quite recognise that you had full personal knowledge while I have none. I could only urge reasons which, from a local standpoint, seemed to me to demonstrate the expediency of the course advocated, both on the Sheikh’s account and in our own interests. On the Sheikh’s account because, on the information before me, whether from Basrah or Mohammerah, the aggression of the Wali seemed deliberate and uncalled for, and because human nature being what it is, it was not conceivable to me that, after what had happened, his relations with Nazif Bey could ever again be sincere or satisfactory. In our own interests because, apart from the general tendency with which he credits most Turkish officials of the new regime, Mr. Crow had described Nazif Bey as being personally impetuous, inexperienced as a Governor, and most undiplomatic ; and also because, in the short time during which the latter held office, he had displayed an attitude of mind actively and specifically opposed to our interests and policy at the head of the Gulf, as the following instances will demonstrate;—• 00 /Us regards Koweit and Mohammerah.—Roth publicly and privately Nazif Bey has declined to admit any right on the part of our Consulate at Basrah to discuss with him matters concerning either port, and he is reported to have expressed publicly, on several occasions, his resentment at British inter ference in Koweit affairs in the past, and his determination not to put up with it in future. We further know from independent sources that he has been making overtures to the Sheikh of Koweit in order to induce him to admit a Turkish Telegraph Office in Koweit connected by a land-line with Basrah or Fao; and, on another occasion, to allow Koweit subjects to be enlisted in the Hasa gendarmerie. (£) As regards Bahrein. —Although instructed from Constantinople not to protest actively against our assertion of protective rights over the principality, speaking for himself, Nazif Bey “ emphatically stated that he could not admit that the British Government had any rights of supremacy over Bahrein ” [vide enclosure to Embassy Despatch No. 6980, dated February 28th, 1910, to His Majesty’s Foreign Office). (c) As regards Baluchistan. —I have it from His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, that a few days after taking up his post, Nazif Bey issued a noti fication in Basrah to the effect that Baluchistan, being an independent state, the pretentions of Foreign Powers to protect Baluchis would under no circumstances be recognised, and that they would be treated as Turkish subjects. Mr. Wilson understands that this question is under reference to His Majesty’s Embassy. It is true that a new Wali might have been equally aggressive, equally inclined perhaps to pursue a policy opposed to our interests ; but I think the probability rather is that he would have been less assertive, while it is hardly possible that he could have been more so. 1 find it difficult to understand Mr. Crow’s view that the recall of the Wali would endanger the security of the river. Sheikh Khazal has been entirely amenable to our advice and guidance throughout his recent troubles with the Wali, and but for that fact, the Wali’s action at Zain would certainly have been followed by a rising of Arabs and consequent insecurity on the river. Had thepresent Wall been replaced at our instance by a less aggressive man, the Sheikh would have recognised the value of our mediation, and would have had no interest of his own to serve, still less excuse to give us, for disregarding our guidance and lending his ear to the overtures which he received from the rest less Arab element on the river. It will be noted from Lieutenant Wilson’s report that these were by no means lacking. (iv) The question of policy involved .—His Majesty’s Government have had difficulty in forming a definite opinion on the actual situation owing to the fact that the views of His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, and myself, on the subject, were opposed. His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, is accredited to a Turkish port, dwelling in a Turkish atmosphere, and hearing only Turkish reports and the Turkish side of the question, while His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, and I perhaps, only see from the Persian point of view and only hear the Persian version. We are all equally entitled to be anxious that the interest of the country to which we are accredited should not be overlooked, but I submit that a quarrel like the present cannot be regarded purely as an isolated Turko-Persian incident, and no con sideration be given to its bearing on British interests and British policy ; and that in regard to the latter, such a wide divergency of opinion as would appear to exist among us should not be possible. I think I am right in believing that, under the present conditions of general international politics, our strongest interests in the Gulf are now focussed at the head of it, and that our chief interest in Persia lie in Mohammerah territory and Arabistan. I have, in the course of some years’ work in the Gulf, arrived at a fairly clear personal conception of what the policy of His Majesty’s Government is in regard to this region, and it is at any rate one which has had the vindica tion of success in the direction of commercial progress and advantage, which is the main object of any policy. I must confess that I cannot see how the atti tude evidenced in Mr. Crow’s letter No. 46, or in his telegrams repeated by His Majesty’s Embassy to the Foreign Office under their Nos. 94 and 95, can be regarded as in harmony with it. Even if he were convinced that the Sheikh of Mohammerah had by his conduct richly deserved the hostility of the Wali, I sub mit that the British interests and position affected would have been better served by his conferring at an earlier stage with our representative at Mohammerah, by urging us to use influence with the Sheikh, and by doing his utmost to restrain the Wali in the meanwhile; rather than by adopting the attitude he did, especially after his cordial testimony of icth March to the Sheikh’s conciliatory behaviour; and in view of the fact that the proceedings of the Wali, which he approved, must seriously affect or react in the jurisdiction of a fellow Consul as well as his own. That the Wali should possibly go through with his arbitrary action by attacking Faihyah or other means, and that His Majesty’s Consul should ask the British Embassy at Constantinople to press for him to be well equipped for the purpose, might serve purely 1 urkish interests and might, if Mr. Crow is correct in his belief, be salutary for the Sheikh of Mohammerah, but encouragement to such a policy seems to me altogether to disregard British interests in Mohammerah territory and the British position at the head of the Gulf, both of which are inevitably affected, and both of which it is the function of us all to safeguard and promote. 3 I am now brought to the Sheikh’s reply, to the particular accusations of recent date quoted by the Wali as to the causes of his hostile action, and to the general accusations of the Basrah authorities and Mr. Crow with reference to years past. It has added to the difficulties of the recent situation that the Sheikh him self was away, out of personal touch with His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, or myself, and that, in his absence, his interests had to reckon with an apparently heavy accumulative record of grievances recorded against him in the archives of His Majesty s Embassy, necessarily based on information from Turkish sources, and, as far as he is concerned, ex parte. I must be pardoned for exhibiting some anxiety lest the merits of his case should suffer in his absence from thiscause. It was from an analogous anxiety, and because I realised the weak position in which Haji Rais found himself when he proceeded to Basrah, that I was slow to take for granted that the onesided solution which he had provision ally to accept at the hands of the Acting VVali would be acquiesced in by the Sheikh. Sheikh Khazal has now returned and had an opportunity of stating his own case, and 1 can best leave Lieutenant Wilson’s record of it to speak for itself. In any case, in the matter of detail, I can add nothing. In regard to the incidents of recent oocurrence, the Sheikh’s replies seem to be satisfactory and to confirm the view that the Wall had no real justification for his action. In regard to the events of past years, Sheikh Khazal lays no claim to complete blamelessness, nor has it been claimed for him. ^ As you are aware, so far as his own territory is concerned, he has been a considerably more en lightened ruler than his predecessors, and during the chaotic times of the last few years his districts have been the most secure and best governed in Persia. As ruler of a border province, and as an Arab landholder in Turkish territory, he has always had a very difficult part to play vis a vis the Turkish authorities at Basrah, and, left entirely to his own devices by the Central Government, has had to protect his own interests and those of his tribesmen in the best way he could. It has been in the main a matter of self-preservation, and I do not think that the description of the position given in paragraph ! 7 of Lieutenant Wilson’s letter, is an overstatement of the straits to which he has at times been reduced, and for which the rottenness of the provincial Turkish administration has been directly responsible. I quite agree that, as the Porte, under the new regime reforms her administration in the Basrah Vilayet, so must the Sheikh of Mohammerah modernise his ideas of border relations, and l believe he will do so under our friendly influence and guidance. On the other hand, hasty and aggressive methods, such as those pursued by Wali Nazif Bey, (if in reality his action can be looked upon merely as the vagary of an impetuous administrative official), are only calculated to defeat their own object. But can the Wali’s proceedings be considered in the above light at all ? The river generally was perfectly quiet at the time of the Zain incident and had been for a long period before, and the measures taken by Nazif Bey were not in the least necessary for the attainment of his professed object, the maintenance of order in the Basrah Vilayet. It seems much more probable that, except as a pretext, riverain affairs had nothing to do with the Wali’s proceedings, and that the real motive for them is rather to be sought in the fact, suggested by His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, some weeks before the present difficulty arose, that the Turkish authorities would not be sorry for an excuse to cause trouble to Persia weak and disorganised as she is ” ; a view to which the concluding sentence of telegram No. 71 from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople to the Foreign Office affords some corroboration. The position is not difficult to understood. The Turks have been able _ to encroach successfully on Persian territory on the Northern portion of the Frontier. At the Southern end they have been powerless to do anything of the sort, firstly, because the Sheikh of Mohammerah can manage the Arabs in his^ own territory, and secondly, because, as an Arab, he has strong influence also with the Turkish Arabs living near the frontier, from whom the Turks would consequently get little sympathy or assistance. Thus, from one side of the border we see that the power of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and his ability to look after himself constitutes the only bulwark on which Persia can reply to preserve her from Turkish encroachment on her South-West Frontier; while from the other side we find that he (with the Sheikh of Koweit indirectly) is the only obstacle to the furtherance of Turkish designs or national policy in the same region. The Porte has thus a patent motive for seeking to attenuate the Sheikh’s power and detach his Arab adherents from him, and the simplest means of effecting that object is for them to make things un pleasant for the Arab tribesmen living near the Frontier and endeavour to show them, now that they (the Turks) have some force at their command, that the Sheikh can no longer help them in their difficulties, as of old.6 The Porte could hardly have selected a better opportunity for giving; practical expression to this policy than the present occasion. Nazim Pasha had just arrived at Baghdad with large powers and a flourish of trumpets. At Basrah they had recently replaced an Arab Governor by an assertive “Young Turk”. Their gunboat “ Marmaris ” was in working trim. In the other camp the juncture found Sheikh Khazal in bad odour with a Cabinet at Tehran, dominated by a Bakhtyari Chief also anxious, both for personal and tribal reasons, to harm the Sheikh and reduce his power. It was even suggested, you will remember, that the Persian Government or Majlis had been previously approached and squared before the attack on the Sheikh’s village took place. Lastly, the instrument selected by the Wali was an excellent one for the purpose, owing to his personal importance as a tribal leader and to his close relations with Sheikh Khazal. The Wali must have known very well that he could not expect such a man to submit to arrest by a handful of gendarmes ; just as he knew well enough that it was not possible for the Sheikh to hand over his own tribal elder and brother-in-law to the Basrah police. This mere fact no doubt supplied the necessary pretext for the use of the “ Marmaris The Wali’s own behaviour since the incident is quite in harmony with the above theory. He was cordially welcomed by Nazim Pasha at Baghdad, and so far from proving amenable to any influence, or persuasion applied by Mr. Crow in order to induce him to express regret to the Sheikh, he almost indignantly rejected his overtures and refused to entertain at all the question of personal amends on the ground that he had only acted under instructions and there had been nothing personal in the matter. But, whether the Zain incident was a personal vagary of the Wali’s, or a premeditated plan emanating from the Porte, the fact remains I submit, that it is our interest and our policy to maintain the Sheikh of Mohammerah in his position as a powerful Arab Ruler at the head of the Gulf. So sure as we do not, our own position will suffer with his., and damage to his influence and well-being will react upon the prosperity of our commercial stake in his territory. I cannot see, therefore, that we have any object to serve in encouraging assertion of “ national rights ” on the part of the Turks, and I venture to hope that, after considering the Basrah and Mohammerah reports regarding the recent incident, His Majesty’s Government will feel able to enunciate some common lines of policy for the guidance of our Consuls at Basrah and Mohammerah, by the joint pursuit of which they will be able to keep the Turkish authorities and the Sheikh within constitutional bounds, and, by doing so, will jointly safeguard our position and great interests at the head of the Gulf. 4. Since writing the above paragraphs, I have received a copy of the Basrah No.60, dated9th June 1910. marginally cited letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, to His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, and forward a copy thereof for your information. With reference to the postcript appended to the enclosure, I also enclose with it a copy of leutenant Wilson s letter on which Mr. Crow’s quotation of him is based. As directed in your telegram No. 131, dated 31st May, lam sending a duplicate of Lieutenant Wilson’s report and of this letter to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, Telegram P., No. 467, dated the 8th May 1910.

His Majesty’s Government and Embassy have no exposition of the Sheikh’s side of the question, but have a case against Mohammerah based on Basrah reports during the last few years.

Reference recent telegraphic corres pondence. Until I learn the views and wishes of His Majesty’s Government, I think it would be better for me to defer going to Mohammerah. Please make the Sheikh some suitable explanation and explain to him that it does not appear to signify if his reply is delayed for a few days. You should go through with him the Turkish accusations against him, and record fully what he has to say in reply to them, and his version of the Basrah- Mohammerah question generally, for the information of Government. We have never had it from the Sheikh himself. As regards the co-operation required by the Turks, is there any particular item in regard to which he is unable or unwilling to comply ? We must insist that he shall do everything that is possible and reasonable in this direction. No. 566, dated the 4th June 1910. From— Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, I.A., His Majesty’s Acting Consul, Mohammerah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to state that, in compliance with your telegrams No. 467, dated 8th May 1910, and 549 of 25th May 1910, I have gone into the question of the Turkish complaints and allegations against the Sheikh of Mohammerah with the latter, and now record below, for your information, his replies to the various allegations and complaints made against him by the Wall of Basrah, together with a translation of his letter in reply to the latter. I also submit a precis showing the progress of the negotiations between the Sheikh and the Wali, and the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, and myself, at each stage. I have also included his replies to various allegations set forth by Mr. Crow, which, though not coming officially from the Turks, may be presumed to show the attitude of the latter towards the Sheikh. I would invite a reference to my despatch No. 441—37, of May 7th, 1910, to His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, on the subject of the dispute between the Wali and the Sheikh. 2. I have also added, where it seemed necessary, my own comments and those of Mr. McDouall, as recorded in the archives of the Consulate. The Turkish allegation is shown in every casein the margin, with an indication of the precise document in which it was contained. The Sheikh replies that it was never alleged, as far as he knows, that any servant of his Agent was implicated : and the Wali never suggested such a thing to him. No more has been heard of this accusation. The Wali, about 15th April, showed him a list of seven persons wanted in connection with the Minawi incident. The Sheikh promised to arrest them if they were in his territories. He at once sent agents in all directions, and in four days time heard that three of them were in the Mohammerah District. He induced them by stratagem to come to Failiyah, and imprisoned them. Troubles with the Wali then ensued, totally Robbers attacked a house at Minawi near Basrah in March 1910 : one of the robbers, said to be a servant of the Sheikh’s Agent, reported that he had fled to Mohammerah, and that that Sheikh refused to give him up (Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 22, dated 22nd April 1910.)unexpectedly, and naturally, particularly as tne Sheikh was away, the handing over of these persons was delayed. A fourth was subsequently obtained. They were handed over on 31st May. They were all Arabs from Basrah and uncon, nected with Mohammerah. 4. The Sheikh replies that the Wali wrote to him on this subject, and that he had promised to do his best, though no proof was offered that the murderer was in his lands. He has had search made every-, where with no result. The Basrah police in the first place made no serious effort to catch the man, and the story that he has fled to Mohammerah was, he says, probably invented by them to explain their own remissness.^ Cnelmeran was an old friend of the Sheikh and of his house, and he looked on him as an adherent. Were even Persia and Turkey at war, the Sheikh says he would hand over his murderer to the Turks. The latter have not given him the slightest indication of their reasons for saying that he has fled to Mohammerah, and in any case, they only suggested it some time after the murder. Chelmeran, Turkish landowner, killed on his lands by his own labourers close to Basrah. Mur derers said to have fled to Mohammerah, and not to have been given up. (Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 22, dated 22nd April 1910.) 5. The Sheikh says this is untrue. Many criminals, fugitives from justice, are re ported to be in Mohammerah, and when Sheikh is asked to hand them over he refuses to do so (Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 22, dated 22nd April 1910.) He asks who “ reports ” them to be in Mohammerah ? If the Turks want individuals from him they have only to name them, specify their offence, and satisfy him that the accused are Turkish subjects. He has frequently handed over even Persian subjects in a friendly way. Let the Turks produce a list, and give their reasons for making such sweeping statements. He absolutely denies the receipt of any list, such as that referred to in Mr. Crow’s letter No. 46, of 27th April, to me, and Mr. Crow himself now says he has no confirmation whatever of the statement that the list was sent. This, the Sheikh says, is simply a repetition of the reply the police in Basrah make to every succeeding Wali, when taken to task for their remissness, thus creating bad blood between Mohammerah and Basrah authorities. 6. The Sheikh’s position in this case is best shown by the following extract from Mr. McDouall’s Despatch No. 55 of Sheikh refused or prevaricated over surrender , A n |1 t onn ■ of persons concerned in Mr. Glanville’s murder in 24 tn April IQOQ . 1906, (Maghil cise). (Mr. Crow’s Despatcn 17, of 10th March 1909, and No. 22, of 22nd April 1910.) “ As to the Maghil case, I do not agree with Mr. Crow’s opinion that the Sheikh did not assist. My opinion was that he did, but it is always very difficult to arrest men of the marsh Arabs, who are protected by their friends: as to the two men, there was reason to suspect that they were wanted by the Turks for other reasons ”. Mr. McDouall’s 18 years’ experience of Mohammerah entitles him to speak on the subject with authority. See also Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 25 of 7th May 1910. When the alleged murderer was brought to Basrah, he was allowed to escape a few days alter. The Turks’ record in the Maghil case is so bad that they cannot throw stones at the Sheikh, and the above complaint is, as a matter of fact, that of Mr. Crow, not of the Wali. 7. The Sheikh replies that the “ trespassers,” whom Mishri tried to have removed in the “usual way,” were sub jects of his own, and belonged to the Persian tribe of Haji Faisal. Mishri was trying to cheat the cultivators referred to out of their legal rights. The Sheikh did his best for some time before the matter came to a head to settle things amicably between Mishri and the cultivators, but without success. Mishti then proposed to replace them with other Arabs, of the tribe of Muhammad Chanan, but the latter tribal chief refused to let any men of his tribe replace Haji Faisal’s men, as this would give rise to a blood-feud, or at least to much bitterness. Mishri was very angry at this, and made a big case of it. He told lies to thq Wali, and to the Mishri, a Turkish landowner, applied to the Turkish authorities in the usual way to remove certain cultivators from his lands at Dawasir, but without success, and trespassers were supported by Muhammad Chanan, an adherent of the Sheikh. (Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 22, of 22nd April 1910 ) N. B .—This is a complaint against Muham- med Chanan, not against the Sheikh,police, and, as far as the Sheikh can make out, the story of his or of his Agent’s life being threatened by Muhammad Chanan is based solely on Mishri’s word, or that of the police, Muhammad Chanan did not no so, nor any responsible person. 8. The Sheikh replies that Muhammad Chanan is a Persian subject, that he wrote as much to the Wall at the time. Reference above complaint, the Turkish police were informed when they tried to arrest Muhammad Chanan that he and all his people belonged to Sheikh, and could not come to Basrah (to be imprisoned), and if arrest was insisted on, Mishri’s Agent would be killed like Chelrperan. (Mr, Crow’s Despatch No. 22, of 22nd April J 9 io). The Tabur Agassi, (police sergeant), went to Zain to arrest Muhammad Chanan, but alleged no specific offence, except that he had been annoying Mishri, who is a tyrannical and grasping man. Tabur Agassi and Muhammad Chanan both came in the same helium to visit the Sheikh at Failiyah and to discuss what should be done, over a friendly cup of tea. Tabur Agassi made no complaint of any kind whatever as to threats, but simply said that Muhammad Chanan said he was a Persian—would the Sheikh write to this effect to the Wali? Sheikh at once wrote a friendly and polite note to the Wali, saying that the Tabur Agassi had seen him on the subject of Muhammad Chanan, that the latter was a Persian subject, but that nevertheless the Sheikh would bring him up to Basrah in two days’ time to discuss the matters at issue, and arrange a settlement. He added that he would be going up the Karun shortly, and would take the opportunity to “ask permission to take his depar ture,” a particularly deferential and courteous phrase. He was, he says, under the impression, when he wrote the letter, that the Wali was on the best of terms with him. He went up to Basrah two days later and found to his surprise that the Wali now refused to receive him at all unless Muhammad Chanan was forthwith handed over to the police. The Sheikh pointed out in vain that he was accused of no specific offence, that he was a Persian, and that the case of Mishri was eminently one for amicable settlement. The Wali was obdurate. » » “ 1 • o**i»-* , 1 V- VI. Wt-iv-v* VII V. I IW IV H • WU IIJUU- ence as a landowner and tribal Sheikh was great, and he thought most of the Mukhtars from Gurnah to Fao were in his pay, or pledged to his interests. (Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 22, dated 23rd April 1910). He had no alternative but to return to Mohammerah with Muhammad Chanan, who, it should be added, is his brother-in-law, and head of the most important of the tribes round Mohammerah. 9. The Sheikh replies that more than half of the tribes from Gurnah to Fao Wali said he distrusted the Sheikh. His influ- happen to be of the Sheikh S tribes and are Persian subjects: the Sheikh in consequence has great influence, and since Mukhtars are always chosen, by the Turks, from the headmen of the locality, it is not surprising jf they are in a way pledged to the Sheikh’s interests. But, he points out, there is no reason to suppose that the Mukhtars are in any way hostile to the Turks influence, and in support of this, and of his own consistently peaceful policy, he points out that the Arab tribes from Gurnah to Fao are the only ones who never give any trouble to the Turks ; they pay their taxes regularly, and are probably as law abiding a community, in their stage of civilisation, as can be found anywhere. The limit of the Sheikh’s influence, Gurnah, is also that of the Turks’ authority. Beyond the point at which the Sheikh’s influence ends, the Turkish authorities have failed to collect revenue for the last three years’ and are still engaged in ineffective punitive operations. 10. The Sheikh’s reply shows that he himself has always attributed the “Wali attributed all the river troubles irom HVCr troubles to the Same CaUSC as Mr JSL’S Crow did in his Despatch No. i 7) of 10 th She.kh’s men” March 1909,, of which the following is an (Ficte supra.) extract:— &amp; As long as action is confined to mere perfunctory police enquiries, and reference is made to a so-called criminal court, where no justice is obtainable, while local authorities are allowed to throw dust in our e) es by arresting offenders and sentencing them to expiate the offences of guilty defaulters, the lawless condition of Basrah will not improve.” 11. In this connection it may not be out of place to refer also to Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 8, of January 30th, 1907, to Sir N. O’Conor, reporting a piracyfrom a British Indian sailing vessel at Abul Khasib. He states that he asked the authorities to capture the pirates and recover the stolen property. The Turkish official at Abul Khasib failed to report the outrage, and no energetic measures were taken until 4 telegrams from the Grand Vizier, as well as one from the Sultan’s Private Secretary, had been received. Even then, the men arrested Were not the real culprits, but men who had incurred the enmity of the police by complaining of their misdoings to Constantinople. y 12. Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 36, of 8th May 1907, to Sir N. O’Conor, is also of interest in this connection, as showing that, at that time, river troubles were due to Turkish bad faith with the Arab tribes and troubles in Basrah to the inefficiency of the Administration. In the latter regard I may quote the following:— There is no improvement in public security. * * Mr Hickey, the British subject who was attacked and robbed by an armed force of brigands * * on May 3rd, narrowly escaped being stabbed. * * The police were not, and never are, on the spot, the gendarmes charged with patrolling the streets are absent from their posts and view these incidents from a safe distance, being much too callous to interfere, or what is still more likely) in league with the robbers themselves. House after house is looted with impunity, while the Turks waste valuable time in fruitless judicial enquiries and in the pursuit of robbers who seem well-known, but who invariably elude the mock vigilance of the executive officers.” 13. Again, in 1908, during Mr. Geary’s tenure of the office of Consul in Basrah, several piracies occurred in the Shatt-el-Arab, which formed the subject, of complaint by^Mr. Geary to the then VVali. In one case only was it suggested that the Sheikh’s Arabs were responsible, and, on enquiry at Mohammerah, it turned out that, though the boatload of pirates pushed off from and returned’to the Persian shore, it was believed that they did this to hide their identity, as Arabs on the Turkish side were reported a few days later to be dividing the spoil. No action was taken by the Turks, and the writer was informed by Mr. Geary himself that the nerveless and corrupt administration of the Basrah Vilayet was in his opinion, responsible for the disturbances. ' ,. kf ’ Sheikh may be excused for doubting that the situation, in 1910, is radically different from that described above by Mr. Crow. He adds that a still commoner method of the police, and likely to be popular in proportion to the efficiency of the courts of justice, is to assert that the criminal has fled to Persian soil. Mr. Crow s _ statement, in his letter to me of 27th April, that he has repeatedly, in previous years, drawn the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the attitude of the Sheikh in regard to river troubles generally, and to disturbances in Basrah in particular, is not supported by the archives 0f l hl ™ l 16 - ^ e 3 ?ond the M aghil case, {vide paragraph 6), and the troubles with Moharrem Bey reported m Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 17, of 10th March 1909, to Constantinople, Mr. Crow seems to have made no complaints agamst the Sheikh, and in the latter case he apparently did not think the matter ot sufficient importance to warrant his sending a copy of his Despatch on the sub- lf C 1 1S 1 ^ a J es ^y s Consul, Mohammerah. The first intimation received t? 6 ., aiter ^&gt; as . . a C0 Py Despatch in question received from n at ? ushi r e &gt; ( who had himself received it from the Resident at Baghdad), together with a request for an expression of view in the subject. 15. This is the crux of the accusation against Muhammad Chanan which led to the attack on Zain, and was the u fons et origo malV\ though it is wholly denied by the Sheikh. I have made most careful enquiry from several sources, and am unable to obtain any confirmation of the Wall’s statements. . .^ s re g ar ds attacking farms, not only can I obtain no corroboration, but also 1 13 inher ently improbable that he would do such a thing, since practically all the Muhammad Chanan Opposed a detachment sent after him for attacking several farms. (Wall’s letter to f ersian Consul-General No. 18.) Muhammad Chanan committed aggression on Turkish lands, threatened to kill the owners, collec ted an armed force to oppose the gendarmes of the State, and supported rebellion. (Acting Wali’s letter of loth May.)farms are in the hands of his own fellow tribesmen. The Sheikh’s version is that Muhammad Chanan would not let his men replace those whom Mishri wanted to turn out, and I believe this to be correct. Mr. Crow tells me he has no infor mation in corroboration or otherwise of the Wall’s statements on this subject. That he committed aggression in Turkish lands, is, as far as I can ascertain, untrue. What kind of aggression ? That he threatened to kill the owners, is, as has been said above, an accusation simply based on hearsay. In this con nection the Sheikh draws attention to the fact that it was the murder of Mishri’s Agent which was first said to have been threatened by Muhammad Chanan. Later, the accusation was that it was Mishri himself whose life was said to have been threatened. Muhammad Chanan was not present at Dawasir at the time, and denies that he ever said such a thing. It is, of course, conceivable that one of his irresponsible followers may have done so. The last accusation that Muhammad collected an armed force to oppose the gendarmes of the Slate, is unsubstantiated by any evidence that I can obtain, and Mr. Crow tells me that, beyond the Wall’s statement, he has heard nothing of it. The Sheikh says, and it is impossible to doubt him in this circumstantial particular, that the Tabur Agassi and Muhammad Chanan came to his place in the same boat, and discussed the question in quite an amicable way, no com plaints being made on either side. It is, therefore, difficult to avoid the conclusion that the. Sheikh is fully warranted in saying that there was nothing against Muhammad Chanan that could not have been settled by half an hour’s conversation with the Wall, as he tried to arrange. Had the Wali, instead of discourteously refusing to see the Sheikh at all on the subject, discussed the question with him, and heard the other side, things would undoubtedly have turned out very differently. The Sheikh believes that Mishri has a spite against Muhammad Chanan because the latter would not let his men act, in the English working man’s parlance, as “ blacklegs,” and that he induced the Wali to believe that Turkish rule was be ing flouted by Chanan. 16 17 16. The principal chronic accusation made against the Sheikh by the Turks is that he exercises illegitimate influence in Turkey. The influence of the Sheikh in Turkish territory is due to the fact that he is the titular head of more than half the Arabs occupying the Turkish bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and expects, and, in a large measure, receives implicit obedience from them. He is a large landowner, with more extensive property on the Turkish side of the river than is possessed by any Turkish subject. He owns valuable house property in Basrah, and, though it has been considerably diminished in value in the last few months by the Wall’s expropriation schemes in connection with new roads, the Sheikh has not allowed the question to interfere with his friendly relations with the Wali, {vide Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 14, of 9th March 1910), asking only to be treated as well as British subjects were being treated. Had he adopted a hostile attitude to the Wali on this point, he would have secured the support of the influential families in Basrah, and might have embarrassed the Wali very seriously. Again, when the news of the attack of the Wali on the Sheikh’s properties was spread abroad, the latter received numerous voluntary offers of active assis tance and co-operation from almost every important Turkish Arab Chief from Amara to Fao. Had he accepted them, and commenced active reprisals against the Turks, he would, I have no doubt, have gravely embarrassed the Turkish Government in Mesopotamia and secured his object, the dismissal of the Wali. Realisation of this fact is not, however, in my humble opinion inconsistent, as Mr. Marling suggests in his telegram No. 31, dated 31st May, with a recog nition by the Sheikh that the rising naval power of the Turks would overwhelm him in the end, unless he could count on the support of His Majesty’s Govern ment. 17. The other important general accusation against the Sheikh is that he has, in the past, connived at or instigated the perpetration of outages in Turkish territory.The Sheikh does not entirely deny this charge, but he admits when Mohar- rem Bey was Wali of Basrah, and only it only in connection with the period (1909) in regard to two or three occasions. He justifies himself by pointing out that Moharrem Bey was a violent and ill-tempered man with whom personal dealings were an impossibility. The Persian Government was then, as now, hopelessly disorganised and unable to make any effective representations at Constantinople ; the Persian Consul-General was equally unable to say anything to the Wali of Basrah, and was, in any case, incompetent. The Wali committed with impunity acts of grave injustice against the Sheikh and against his subjects living in Turkish territory. Protests proved of no avail, and the petitions which the people of Basrah sent to Constantinople asking for the removal of the Wali were unanswered. Deprived of all diplomatic weapons, unable, by reason of Moharrem Bey’s personality, to discuss things with him in a friendly spirit^the Sheikh had recourse to the only means at his command to secure what was, in his eyes, the only remedy—the removal of the Wali. He was successful as the Wali was re moved shortly afterwards, and the Sheikh’s action had the support of the people of Basrah to whom Moharrem Bey had been equally obnoxious. 18. The Sheikh, in winding up the conversation, emphasised the fact that his specific grievances against the Turks were numerous and likely to be more serious in the future than at present. The Turkish officials were, he said, pursu ing a policy of pin pricks in regard to him and his tribe, and causing great an noyance to the latter. Extortion, arbitrary action by Turkish officials against Arabs on the ex parte statements of avaricious Turkish landlords were now every day incidents and the constant subject of complaints to him. The present Wali seemed, he said, to be bent on putting all sorts of impracticable laws into force amongst Arabs, upsetting the status quo and the tranquillity of the country side, not apparently in order to remedy the state of affairs, but solely in order to cause trouble amongst peaceable Arabs, whilst at the same time he took no serious steps to bring to book those tribes such as the Muntafik, who openly defied his authority. Copy of a reply of the Sheikh of Mohammerah to the Acting Wall's letter of i6tk May 1910. Dated 25th Jamadi*ul-Awwal, 1328. From—KHAZAL bin JABIR, To—The Wali of Basrah. After compliments.-—Your letter of 3rd Rabi-u-Sani, No. 133, which your Agent, Saad Bey, sent me reached me on the Karun and the contents have been noted. Regarding the acts which you did at Kut-i-Zain, on account of the threatening by Muhammad Chanan of the Tabur Agassi and the Gendarmes, whom you had sent to see him. I am much surprised at your account of the matter. On this account, that when the Tabur Agassi came with Muhammad Chanan to Failiyah to see me, he made no complain and made no mention of such acts. As we are united and friends, I do not want to say more on this subject. Were I to do so, I am sure that I should be vindicated, and your sense of justice would corroborate me.. What happened at Kut-i*Zain is not hidden from you. Moreover, Muhammad Chanan, as is well known, is a chief of the Muhaisin tribe, and a Persian subject, and he was my agent in Zain, for the care of my lands there. In accordance with your agent’s letter, 1 have removed him, and will replace him by another person. Regarding those who attacked and killed Chelmeran. From the first day that I heard the news, I give the necessary orders in my own districts to search for and capture the murderers, but they have not up to date been found, and do not belong to the people of this district. If a single one of them comes into my district, he will be seized and handed over.13 Regarding the Minawi incident. When you mentioned the matter to me, l gave the necessary orders, and one day before my departure to the Karun I captured three of them. As I was on the point of leaving, I could not inform the Vilayet, and on my return in the same way I captured one more of them, and informed the agent of the Vilayet that he might send an agent to take them over. A reply was received, an agent sent, and the men handed over. With regard to what you wrote about handing over fugitive criminals, on this matter a treaty exists between Turkey and Persia, ard I am a Persian subject, and hereditary warden of the frontier, and Your Excellency is no doubt aware of the Treaty. Therefore, I and Your Excellency cannot give undertakings contrary to the Treaty, but in view of the friendly relations that exist between us, in the past and in the future in all matters relating to the prevention of trouble, in no way has any fault been found, nor will be in the future. No evil acts have hitherto been committed by my tribes in Turkish terri tory. As far as possible I will make extreme efforts for the preservation of peace and security there, and to that end l consider myself responsible. And whenever you desire to conclude a personal agreement between us, relating to the above treaty between the two Governments, I am at your service. MEMORANDUM. The following memorandum is intended to supplement the documentary narrative of the troubles which have recently arisen between the Sheikh of Moham- merah and the Wali of Basrah, and to explain briefly the action of the writer vis a vis the Sheikh of Mohammerah and His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah. The first intimation that any trouble was likely was conveyed to me on 24th April by a copy of Mr. Crow’s despatch No 22 of 23rd April 1910, to His Majesty’s Embassy, detailing an interview which he had had with the Wali, in which the latter, after making a series of complaints against the Sheikh, annunced his intention of sending the gunboat “ Marmaris ” to Zain to demons trate, and, if necessary, punish Muhammad Chanan and his retainers. The Wali further said that he intended to take strong action. Remarking from this despatch that Mr. Crow had made no protest to the Wali against his proposals, and had not considered the matter of sufficient immeidate importance to justify a telegraphic report to Constantinople, I hurried to Basrah forthwith (April 24th) to attempt to induce Mr. Crow to take action to dissuade the Wali from carrying out his plans. It was, however, too late, as the Walt had already sent the “ Marmaris ”, and, in any case, Mr. Crow seemed disinclined to take action, and suggested that the Wali was not in earnest. I, however, prevailed upon him to send a wire to Constantinople on the subject. On my return to Mohammerah at midday, on April 25th, l found that the ‘‘Marmaris” had shelled and burnt Muhammad Chanan’s village an hour previously. I at once proceeded to the spot with a representative of the Sheikh, ascertained precisely what had occurred, telegraphed the facts to the Resident at Bushire, and returned the same evening to Basrah to see Mr. Crow again and inform him of what had occurred. Previous to going to Basrah, however, I visited the Sheikh’s principal men in Mohammerah and warned them to do nothing whatever, and to allow no reprisals pending orders from the Sheikh who had proceeded to Ahwaz on 21st instant. On arrival at Basrah, I found that Mr. Crow had heard nothing of what had occurred at Zain, and he did not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situa tion that it created. In reply to my letters of 24th and 25th he answered, on the 27th, that the day of reckoning for the Sheikh had come, and that, though the action of the Turks might be arbitrary, he would press for them to be supplied with the proper means to carry it through. He, however, modified his attitude to some extent, as, when he attended a reception by the Wali held on the “ Marmaris”, he listened coldly to the Wali’s triumphant remarks on the subjectof the gunboat’s action and, (at he informed me), told the W all that his impetu* ous action was ill calculated to secure the results ostensibly desired, and that he would have done welhto consult His Majesty s Consul before taking action. The Wali shortly afterwards left for Baghdad where he was to meet Nazim Pasha, under whose general control he now is. He received an exceptionally cordial and distinguished reception. The Sheikh meanwhile, at Ahwaz, telegraphed for advice to me as to whether he should return to Mohammerah at once or not. I replied that he ^ should not return at present as his precipitate arrival on the scene would certainly create a lively anticipation of reprisals, the expectation of which might induce the Wall to pursue his hostile policy still further. My fears were confirmed by the Wahs letters about this time (2bth April) to the Persian Consul-General at Basrah, in which he threatened to attack Mohammerah. As the Sheikh is guaranteed by us against unprovoked attack by sea, he at once, on learning of this letter, telegraphed to Mirza Hamza to beg me to tele, graph to Bushire asking that we would support him in accordance with our pro mises by sending a gunboat to Mohammerah to protect him from attack by sea, and to show the Turks that we could not tolerate any such action. Trus sug gestion was negatived by His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires, Tehran, and luckily the Wali did not carry out his threats. The Sheikh feels acutely our refusal to send a gunboat, in spite of the fact that an attack on Mohammerah was officially threatened by the Wali unless Muhammad Chanan was surrendered. The refusal has^detracted from the value in his eyes of our assurances, since, on the only occasion when we have peen asked to render him prompt support, we have withheld it for fear of giving umbrage to the Turks On 5th May, Haji Rais, the Sheikh’s righthand man, who had been sent down by the Sheikh with instructions to consult me as to the advisability of proceeding to Basrah to interview the Wali, arrived from Nasiri With my con currence he wert on to Basrah, though in a state of considerable trepidation for his personal safetv. The Wali had by this time left for Baghdad and Haji Rais accordingly visited the Acting Wall and by his intermediation effected atemporary settlement'with the W'ali, the Acting Wali giving him a letter to the Sheikh, offer ing to resume amicable relations on certain conditions. The letter contained much that was objectionable to the Sheikh, threats and unjustified^ allegations being freely intermingled with polite phrases. But Haji Rais, in the weak position in which he was, having clearly understood from Mr. Crow that His Majesty’s Consul had no authority to press the W^ali to descend from the position which he had taken up, felt bound to accept it as assuring a temporary cessation of hostilities. He was, moreover, plainly informed (he told me) by Mr. Crow that his orders “ to promote an amicable settlement ” did not, in his opinion, justify any attempt to put active pressure on the Wali. I agreed with Haji Rais that this' being the case the settlement was the best ad interim arrangement procurable, pending a decision by His Majesty’s Government on the general question, audit was represented to and regarded by the Sheikh in this light. Further negotiations were then delayed for a fortnight pending the return of the Sheikh from Ahwaz, where he was occupied in reconciling the Arab tribes near Dizful to each other, with a view to preventing disturbances there. On the 24th May he returned from Ahwaz, and I at once communicated to him Foreign Office Telegram No. 137, (received May 14th), stating that serious representations had been made in Constantinople, and that a gunboat would be held in readiness in case it should be required for the protection of Mohammerah territcry. This announcement did a good deal to improve the sheikh’s state of mind and gave him reason to hope that the eventual settlement provided would have adequate regard for his rights and prestige as w'ell as for those of Turkey. The Sheikh consulted me as to the tenour of the reply which he should send to the Wali in answ'er to the Acting Wall’s letter of 1 ith May. I outlined a reply which seemed to be suitable, and he concurred with me unreservedly. 1 _ then submitted the outlines of the proposed reply for the approval of the Resident. I also sent a copy to Mr. Crow who, in reply, informed me that, with a few minor alterations, he considered the reply unobjectionable.In the meanwhile I received orders to proceed to Basrah to con r er with Mr. Crow with a view to a settlement on the lines of Foreign Office Telegram No. 165, (received Tehran, May 26th), z&gt;., “Sheikh to promise to give up Turkish criminals and not foment disturbances. Wali to express regret for injury to Sheikh’s family and assure him that, if he keeps his promises, his tribes and property will not be molested The Sheikh was quite ready to do his share on these lines, though he does not admit that he has sheltered Turkish criminals nor habitually fomented dis turbances in the past. The Wali, however, was at some pains to make it perfect ly clear that he would not accept Mr. Crow’s intervention in the matter, and that he would not apologise in any way. This being the case, and the Wali being on his way back to Basrah, the Sheikh saw at once that, to delay his reply until the question of the Wali offering an expression of regret had been disposed of, would be injudicious. Pending receipt of the approval of His Majesty’s Government to his proposed reply to the Wali, he asked the Turks to send men to take over 4 criminals for whom they had applied. These men reached Basrah, as intended by the Sheikh, two days before the arrival of the Wali, thus avoiding any slight to the Acting Wali, who had taken part in the preliminary negotiations for their surrender. On 2nd June, 2 days after the return of the Wali, I was informed by Colonel Cox, in his telegram of 30th May, to the effect that the Sheikh’s proposed reply was approved, and I at once told the Sheikh to send it off. On the 4th June he accordingly sent Haji Rais, his righthand man, to Basrah with the reply, (a copy of which is appended to my letter forwarded here with) The Wali received Haji Rais politely and seemed not dissatisfied with the Sheikh’s reply, to which he sent a polite answer. His protestations of friendship and his expression of hope that the Sheikh would let “ bygones be bygones” were unfortunately considerably discounted by several occurrences which took place whilst Haji Rais was in Basrah as the guest of the Wali. In the first place, a law' suit in which one Mustafa, a servant of Mirza Hamza, the Sheikh’s Basrah Agent, was concerned was revived and warrants issued for the man’s arrest, regardless of the fact that, during the negotiations between Haji Rais and the Acting Wali, the latter had obtained the withdrawal of the case and had promised that no more should be heard of it. Haji Rais was informed by the W ali, in reply to his protest, that the latter knew nothing of the Acting Wali’s action in the matter, and, in any case, could not intervene in judicial questions. Haji Rais, however, understands that the Wali himself requested that the case should be re-opened. Secondly, for the third time since the troubles between the Sheikh and the Wali began, the Sheikh’s houses on the Ashar Creek were partly pulled dowm, in spite of the fact that they did not project into the roadway, and that their frontage had been some time back formally approved by the Wali. Wffien re presentations were made to the Wali on this subject, he said on each occasion that it was a mistake on the part of a subordinate official and that he would issue orders to prevent its recurrence. But it is remarkable that such mistakes should not have been made in the case of other persons’ houses. Haji Rais further tells me that he has definite information that the Wall instigated these acts. Lastly, whilst Haji Rais was in Basrah an official of the Courts of Justice with a band of soldiers raided the empty house of the Sheikh’s Basrah Agent, and forcibly distrained his carriages and some other possessions, on the ground that a summons for debt had been issued against him by Government for pay ment of £30° but had been disregarded. The Wali denied all knowledge of the matter and ordered the return of the goods distrained But Adbul Wahab al Kartass has told Haji Rais that the case was started by the Wali himself in revenge for Mirza Hamza’s attitude in regard to the Sheikh’s house property in Basrah, and that the Wali personally interested himself in obtaining a judgment against Mirza Hamza; the latter states, how T ever, that no summons ever reached him. The cumulative effect of these incidents has been to convince the Sheikh that the present Wali is hopelessly unreliable, if not actually treacherous, andf \6 that as long as he remains in Basrah there will be no guarantee of a recurrence of troubles such as have occurred recently, unless the Turkish authorities both in Basrah and Constantinople are given plain intimation that His Majesty’s Government are supporting him and will not tolerate aggression on Mohammerah Mr Crow has given Haji Rais plainly to understand that he is unable to intervene in Basrah affairs, where the Wali is acting ostensibly in conformity with judicial administrative rules, and the Wali has not less plainly informed Mr Crow that he will not tolerate his intervention in Mohammerah and Koweit affairs. It is important that it should be fully understood that the Sheikh has every thing to lose and nothing to crain by gratuitously opposing the Wali of Basrah and no one realises this better than he does. The value of the personal property which he inherited from his father on the Turkish bank of the river is probably nnt less than £ million pounds, and it is not reasonable to suppose that as long as the Wali treats him with tolerable consideration he wi l court difficulties in connection with his property, or jeopardise the peace and prosperity of his tribal tenants by lightly incurring the hostility of the Basrah authorities. In the case of the Wali, the position is quite different. He may have an easier task when he is on gool terms with the Sheikh, but he has the support of his Government when he is not. He is here to-day and gone to-morrow and has no personal stake or local interest, and for the rest is imbued with the chronic Turkish idea that the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit are the chief obstacles to the realisation of Turkish ambition to reduce the Arab population of Turkish Arabia, the condition of serfs destitute of any hereditary right to the land which they occupy. I should add, finally, that I showed His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah the draft of the letter’to which this precis is appended, and asked him whether he had any information which would tend ^ to refute or throw doubt upon the genuineness of the Sheikh’s replies to various allegations made^ by the 1 urks. He replied that he was not now, and never had been in a position to sift the truth of the allegations made by the Turks, that the latter were invariably untruthful, and that, situated as he was in Basrah, he had no opportunities for applying an independent test to the accounts given him by the Turks of the recent troubles or of others He added that should His Majesty’s Embassy ask him to submit evidence in support of the Wali’s allegations or of his own statements, he would suggest that the Turkish Government were in a better position than he to furnish such controversial material. I should add that Mr. Crow’s dragoman is a Turk, and obtains his informa tion from Turkish sources, and that circumstances usually seem to preclude Mr. Crow from obtaining the views of Arabs on current issues, even if he desired to know them.

Sir,visited me the same evening and, according to his account, the Wali gave him a triendly reception kept him to lunch and discussed the Zain business and general relations with Mohammerah unreservedly. i a P ar ^ es gave their respective versions of the immediate events which led to the breach, and the Wali remarked, infer alia, that local reports had been sent to Constantinople complaining that he left the administration of outlying districts too much in the hands of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and said he had been censured by Constantmople in consequence. He read and accepted the oheikh s written reply to his letter without comment, saying merely that he had n °f Sheikh personally, but he wanted his loyal assistance to catch I urkisn criminals who escaped to Mohammerah and professed himself willing to reciprocate if Persian criminals fled to Basrah. He added he would not allow the Police to take advantage of the friendly understanding between the Sheikh and himself in order to make a scapegoat of Mohaijimerah whenever they railed to catch culprits, and said applications for surrender would only be made in w r ell^ authenticated cases, after careful enquiry and production of satisfactory evidence of the parties’ guilt. He assured him that friendly rela tions with the Sheikh were now restored. Haji Rais asked the Wali to write a friendly private letter to the Sheikh to that effect, and the Wali undertook to do so. Haji Rais also referred to the partial destruction of some of the Sheikh’s new buildings on the Ashar creekj and the Wali agreed to examine the ground in his presence on the following day and see what was required. I called on Abdul Wahab el Kartass at Saraji, about 3 miles down river, on June 6th, and discussed the affair with him. He is an intimate friend of Sheikh Khazal s and is well aware of all that has lately occurred. He agreed to visit the Sheikh at Mohammerah as soon as Haji Rais had returned and inform me how matters stood. Haji Rais called again on me in the evening. He brought me a copy in Arabic of the Sheikh's reply and showed me a sealed private letter, which he had received from the Wali for the Sheikh of which, however, he did not know the contents. He said he had come to an amicable understanding with the Wali about the Sheikh’s new houses and had arranged to stop all work until the Vilayet engineer had drawn up a plan of the proposed new quarter to work upon. Haji Rais then left for Mohammerah. I called on the Wali on Tuesday morning, June 7th. I had not met him since his return from Baghdad, on June 1st. He was friendly and polite but observed a frigid silence in regard to the Mohammerah question. When I broached the subject, he expressed deep resentment at my interference, and could not believe that the British Government, which had helped Turkey so much in past years, was now going to turn against it on account of the little Sheikh of Mohammerah. He said he could not conceal the great surprise my letters had caused him and that he was prepared to meet any criticism of his acts provided it came from the proper quarter, namely his own Department. He was astounded that I should have represented the Sheikh of Mohammerah as being interested in the affair of Kut-el-Zain, as that locality was part of Turkey and the brigands who were harboured there were Turkish subjects. He remarked that he had directed the Acting Wali to accept no interference from me in the matter, either official or private, as the question in no way concerned England. He then went on to tell me that, before his appoint ment as Wali, he had been Editor of the “ Tesvir Efkiar ” and was quite courant, not only of events in Persia, but also of English foreign politics, and he proceeded to give me a lengthy and somewhat journalistic account of his views on these subjects. His arguments, however, as far as I could measure them, seemed as wide of the matter in hand as they were removed from the precincts of reason. I replied that I was sorry we were such an interfering people; unavoidably we had our finger in many pies but this need not disturb the excellent relations which existed between ourselves, and I merely wanted to tell him what theri 1 ^ D 18 Foreign Office said about this Mohammerah business. I said we were glad to hear he had effected a reconciliation with the Sheikh and were obliged to him for meeting us in the matter. I had already communicated the views not of myself but of His Majesty’s Government on this subject to the Acting Wall, j had received many telegrams from the Foreign Office, our Embassy at Constantinople and the Legation at Tehran, and all agreed on the necessity of arranging matters amicably between himself and the Sheikh.^ His Majesty s Government wished the affair dealt with locally, and I now desired, with his permission to communi cate the instructions I had received. As to the matters in dispute His Excellency had communicated directly with the Sheikh, letters had been exchanged and friendly relations re-established. I had twice written privately to His Excellency regarding some expression of regret on his part to the Sheikh for his personal famify trouble. His Majesty’s Government thought it would be well, in order to strengthen and confirm the good understanding now arrived at if His Excellency would express in a friendly and P nvate . m . a ™ er , hl %^ e § r f t, that IS to say, his condolences for the personal injury sustained by the Sheikh namely, the death of his wife, and the discomfort caused to his mother and would assure the Sheikh that, if he kept his promises, his tribes andh is property on Ottoman soil would not be molested.” I read this passage to him and offered to give my Turkish translation, but he said he prefered to have it verbally. 1 also carefully explained to him that His Majesty’s Government did not ask for an apology for what had occurred but simply an expression of regret for the ^effih s private trouble, and I pointed out that, although we fully realised the difficulties of the Turkish Government on the river, we were old friends with the Sheikh as with Turkey, and if we had not protected the Sheikh in his dealings with the Persian Government, Mohammerah and Arabistan would have gone to the dogs long ago. We were deeply interested in Arabistan where we had about half a million ot capital invested, and we wanted no quarrels between the Governors of Basrah and Mohammerah. We were prepared to use our influence with the jhmkh to keep him from fomenting disturbances on the Turkish side, but if he did not keep his promise we should certainly not protect him. The Wali answered that he had practically fulfilled the second part of our request as he had written privately to the Sheikh on the preceding ^ day an assured him of his friendship and good will and protection of his affairs in turkey and assurances to the same effect were given in the last paragraph of his previous letter, (see enclosure 3 in my despatch No. 26, of May 14th, to Uie Embassy), but he firmly, though politely, declined to write anything to the Sheikh in t e form of condolence or regret for the Sheikh’s personal concerns, with which, he said, he had nothing to do. He declared himself convinced that his action at Zain was justified and fully vindicated by past history on the river and, as the action was undertaken on behalf of his Government and had nothing persona^ about it, any personal expression of regret on his part would be useless an meaningless. I replied that His Excellency must decide for himself and that I could do no more than reiterate the express wishes of His Majesty’s Governmenh which I had been instructed to explain to him, and I would communicate his views to Constantinople. I again visited Abdul Wahab el Kartass at Saraji on the morning of the 9th instant and he told me he had spent several hours with the Sheikh of Moham merah at Failiyah on the preceding day and had read the Wali’s private letter, which he said, was friendly and conciliatory. He said good relations were restored and the breach healed. I consider Abdul Wahab’s opinion of value. He is an important personage here and an intimate friend of Sheikh Khazal, and is well aware of the difficulties the Turks have had in the past years with Mohammerah. No man in Basrah knows the position better and, when friendly meetings between Arab Sheikhs and Turkish Walls occur, they are | ea ® ra ^ held at his house.

In forwarding the letter to me Mr. Wilson states that the Sheikh attaches no importance to the expression of regret and does not want it now. F. E. C. 8th June igio. My dear Crow, Yours of 8th. I have handed over 2 halters to Lyold Scott &amp; Company, Limited, to be sent up to you by first opportunity. I will let you know what the cost is later. I enclose a copy of the letter of the Wali to the Sheikh. The Sheikh now says that he cares little for apologies as the Wali is so impetuous that to force him to give them from Constantinople would only make things worse. We have tried once and failed, and in his view, to try to work it from the Porte, even if successful, would do more harm than good. But he is most anxious that we should insist both in Basrah and in Constantinople on our right to intervene in Mohammerah affairs being recognised fully by the Wali. That, he says, will be the best guarantee against trouble in the future. I quite agree with him, and shall do my best in Bushire to get the Resident to press this point of view on His Majesty’s Government. He tells me that the Wali has publicly announced that he will not tolerate the interference of His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah ’ in any affairs either at Koweit or at Mohammerah. He says that the Wali is not only impetuous but treacherous, as his conduct in relation to Sheikh Khazal’s house, which has been three times quite needlessly pulled down, after having been repaired. Haji Rais says he had definite proof, when in Basrah, that the Wali knew all about it. Regarding the seizure of Mirza Hamza’s property in Basrah by order of the Court, of which the Wali disclaimed all knowledge to Haji Rais, it now appears that the claim for ^300 was commenced by the Wali against Mirza Hamza in revenge for his attitude on the house question, and that the Wali has secretly instigated the proceedings all along. This is our side of the question. I think the Wali is altogether instable, and that nothing but trouble will arise as long as he remains in Basrah. Yours sincerely, A. T.

Copy of a letter No. C.-^6 t {Confidential,) dated Kuwait, the I$th June 1910, from Captain W. H. /. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to certain items in my diaryf for the tExtract attached current week relating to the reported in- rExtract attached. ^ ^ terest of the present Wali of Basrah in matters concerning Kuwait. I have referred to the same subject in recent reports dealing with other matters but as further information seems to point to the fact that the question of the exact status of Kuwait as between Turkey and Great Britain before very long will inevitably be forced upon us for some definite solution, I am led to put before you such information as has so far come to my knowledge and brought me to this conclusion. 2. In October 1909 I heard from Muhammerah that Shaikh Mubarak’s Secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badr, was reported to be trying to bring about a closer union between Kuwait and the Turkish Government. I did not credit the report at the time and have had no reason to do so later, for the man himself was imprisoned by the Turks for some considerable time in Basrah and has no particular cause to regard them with affection, though no doubt he might be willing to act as their tool for a substantial consideration. Shaikh Mubarak also trusts him more than any other person of his entourage which I think would be unlikely if he knew or had the slightest reason to suspect him of any intrigue. He is, however, always employed as the Shaikh’s confidential agent in matters at Basrah. 3. In October 1909 the present Wali, Suliman Nathif Bey, arrived at Basrah and at once began to show his mettle by summary orders for the general improve ment of local conditions in Basrah. He also began cultivating Shaikh Mubarak’s friendship most assiduously. Meetings between tlie Wali and the Shaikh became far more frequent than has been the case with former incumbents; and, wherever possible, the Wali has done his best to attract Mubarak with assistance in matters which closely affect his pocket. The Shaikh in discussing the Wali to me said that though the Wali was always talking about impossible schemes he had undoubtedly done much for Mubarak himself, especially in regard to his properties at Fao where he had put an end to all difficulties in the repairing of his date-garden embankments, encroachments by the Turkish military authorities, etc., by going down himself and issuing the requisite orders in person. He had also obtained from Constantinople the rescission of the suspensory orders which had created so much of the difficulty about his Fadhagiya property. 4. Against these benefits we have the reported proposals of the Wali to connect Kuwait and Basrah by telegraph, to despatch Turkish officers in charge of Kuwaiti gendarmerie to A 1 Hasa, the Wall’s insistence on the registration of the Shaikh’s sons as Turkish subjects as a preliminary to the legal transfer of his Fadhagiya property, and the latest rumours of a Turkish detachment for Kuwait itself, the offer of official Turkish recognition of Mubarak as respon sible for practically the whole of North-West Arabia, enquiries as to the flagthe Shaikh flies, etc. Kuwait which formerly scarcely ever figured in Arabic newspapers now finds mention under the heading of Basrah News in the Cairo papers over the signature of the Basrah correspondent. ^ 5. As bearing on this subject it may be of interest to note here that the items in my diary were obtained from a local source but curiously enough were con firmed almost exactly in conversation with M. Toukholka, Russian Consul at Basrah, during his few hours’ visit to Kuwait. He said to me that he was much interested in Persian Gulf politics, and having but lately arrived in Basrah, where he constantly heard the position of Kuwait discussed, he was naturally desirous of seeing the place and its ruler, to use his own words “ he had no instructions to pursue any active policy at Basrah for the place did not really affect Russia, and consequently he had very little to do officially. Thus he was afforded the oppor tunity of seeing our position in regard to Kuwait, the Baghdad Railway, Muhammerah and the Persian Gulf generally from the point of view of an inter ested on-looker.” He said he had heard in Basrah that Mubarak used to fly a flag which was exactly similar to the Turkish with the exception that the Kuwait flag carried three white stars but that within the last two years Mubarak at the request of the Wali had reverted to one star! He informed me that his own introduciion from the Wali to Mubarak bore the superscription of “ Kaimmakam of Kuwait,” and that the Wali had frequently mentioned the position of Kuwait in conversation; he had said that the policy of the new Turkey was to maintain the “status quo,” which, so far as Kuwait was concerned, he was convinced the Turks regarded as implying distinct subjection to them, and that to prevent the possibility of Kuwait vanishing beyond their hold, as they considered had already happened in the cases of Maskat and Bahrain owing to their own negligence, they would probably make some serious effort to establish in Kuwait an indubitable visible sign of their predominance. He thought we should have a very difficult question to solve more specially as the new Turkish Government was a vastly different affair to the one to which the Powers had become accustomed under the regime of Abdul Hamid. His own experience in Macedonia and Albania less than six months ago before his appointment to Basrah had shown him the differ ence very plainly. He said that the Wali at Basrah was undoubtedly working for his own coun» try’s good and that he was supported whole-heartedly by Nazim Pasha. The latter though styled Wali of Baghdad had been sent out by the Turkish Govern ment with a promise of generous support and had been given a free hand first to re-organize thoroughly the Vlth Army Corps, and, when that object had been achieved and an effective weapon been thereby supplied, to consolidate Turkish power in the southern vilayets and amongst the Arab s. M. Toukholka did not appear to me to be trying to obtain information seriously, for though he asked some inconvenient questions as to how we regard ed Mubarak officially, he hardly waited for a reply and seem more intent on dis playing his own knowledge of and interest in the situation than in deliberately “pumping” me. He gave me the impression of an energetic man really anxious to see things by travelling about himself and inclined to be garrulous as to his own experiences. I have reported M. Toukholka’s conversation in some detail above in order to show that in Basrah at least the status of Kuwait is discussed fairly freely among officials. 6. Shaikh Mubarak himself talks tome quite openly of the Wali and his various schemes and makes no secret of his own opinion that the Wali is endea vouring to bring about some way of introducing Turkish influence into Kuwait. He expresses himself as being averse to any such influence but at the same time compelled to meet the Wali amicably and to do nothing likely to arouse his animosity for fear of reprisals on his properties on the Shatt-el-Arab. That the Shaikh desires absolute independence is certain, but he has suffi cient acumen to see that his property on the river furnishes Turkey with a valu able hostage from himself, that we for our own reasons do not desire the growthof Turkish influence at the head of the Persian Gulf, and that Kuwait is therefore in the happy position of being sought by two Great Powers, thus affording him a lever by which he can increase his own importance while balancing the two Powers against each other in all matters concerning himself. Extract from the Kuwct i t Political Diary No. 24, for the week ending 15th June 1910, 14th June. It is reported that the Wali of Basrah proposed to send a detachment of Turkish soldiers with 3 officers to be permanenily stationed at Kuwait and that Shaikh Mubarak has agreed saying there would be no objection. It is said that the Wali has been making enquiries as to what flag the Shaikh flies, and that he has promised Shaikh Mubarak a Firman giving him the control of Najd, Hasa, Katar, Katif, etc. G. C. B.

Sir, A court-martial is being held at Basrah to enquire into the murder of Mr. Glanville and a native at Marghil on Eebruary 28th last. Erom the evidence already obtained there appear to be seventeen persons implicated, of whom the following are still at large:— Hassan-bin-Amara of the Madan at Doghat Yamain. Y nsuf -bin- Amara.

Sahar-bin-Ishaq-ei-Tama.1 should he much obliged if you would Communicate with the Shaikh of’ Mohammerah or his representative on the subject, and urge on them the importance of aiding us in the task of arresting and discovering these persons. It is understood that the first names, Hassan, Yusuf and Shinawah of the Madan are at Mohammerah, and that Khulaif is also there or at Koweit. I hope the Shaikh will lend the weight of his powerful authority to enable us to bring these persons to justice. I have, etc., F. E. CROW. Copy to Koweit through Bushire. (Enclosure No. 2.)

There are, however, no Madan Arabs at present in the neighbourhood. The Sardar Arfa writes that he has sent special orders to his representative Mirza Hamza to do all in his power to assist in the arrest of any person implicated, and, on hearing of the murder, sent orders to all the districts under him to keep a look out and arrest any suspecious strangers.

The very unsatisfactory results however of the visit of the Turkish police to Mohammerah do not show that these promises have been faithfully carried out. The Chief Commissioner of Police states that his information is that Hassan and Yusuf-bin-Amara and Shinawah, brother of Nassuri, Madan fromDogbat Yamain are at Mohammerah is correct; and that the police proceeded there and applied to Mirza Hunza, and that the latter replied that he was not certain the men were there in the first place and in the second he could give no answer in the absence of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. This result was duly communicated to the Wali at Amara by the President of the Court-martial and it was on receipt of this information, on the 17th instant, that I applied for your assistance. Prom the statement of the prisoner Dahagesh-bin-Abdul Aziz of Umm-es- Suhar, who has admitted his participation in the attack, it would appear that the Madan in question are dependents of Mirza Hamza himself and look to him for protection. This is confirmed generally in Basrah and is a matter of notoriety. I should he glad if you would assist me in contradicting or verifying the truth of this statement. The prisoner further states that the three Madan persuaded him to join the band, giving him a gun said to belong to Mirza Hamza and telling him the latter would protect. 1 should have attached no importance to these statements, which are recorded in the minutes of the Court-martial of the 13th instant, but are at variance with what the prisoner told me when I examined him myself previously, if the representative of the Sardar Arfa had shown and disposition to aid the Turkish police in their investigations, but, as my information leads me to believe he did not carry out his promises to you, in this respect, I think it is as well you should be acquainted with them. In soliciting your good offices to aid me in endeavouring to bring the murderers of Mr. Glanville to justice, I venture to hope that your enquiries may tend to remove the unfortunate impression created by the action of Mirza Hamza in omitting to give the Turkish police the assistance they required. Since writing the above, I. learn that the Wali has twice written to Moham merah to have the persons mentioned arrested, as well as Sahir-bin-Ishaq-el- Tama and that their thereabouts are stated in these letters.

Sir, In continuation of the correspondence ending with your No. 24 of the 23rd instant, regarding the murders at Marghil, I have the honour to inform you that I have asked His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, to inform the Sardar Arfa of what you say. Mirza Hamza being an Arab it is possible that he might protect dependents of his own, though I do not believe he would in this case, Europeans being concerned. I saw him this morning and he mentioned that the statement attributed to the prisoner that he was promised Mirza Hamza’s protection was ridiculous, and that he understood that you were in communication with the Wali as to the unsatisfactory conduct of the case by his representative. As to the three men, Hassan, Yusuf and Shinawah they are not at Mohammerah, hut he thinks they are probably at Eallahiyah and has sent to enquire. If they are, he will keep a watch on them, and have themarrested later. It would not be advisable to arrest them at once as the Pallabiyab contingent will probably be called out for service against the Beni Truf, but if the men are there he will see they do not escape. He says the acting Wali has also written asking his assistance to arrest the Mukhtar of Kut Firang, the very man who was sent here by him officially to look for Khalaif. He is believed to have gone to Eao, but this letter throws a light on the acting Wali’s conduct of the case. With regard to the other names mentioned in your No. 22, of the 17th instant, he says the sons of Choubeidh are well known bad characters and that he only knows the name Nazif-ibn- Choubeidh, two of whose brothers were killed some time ago in an encounter with the police. The most likely place for the sons of Choubeidh to be found would be at Jezirah Sagar. With regard to the rest of the other suspects, if the names of the masters of the negros and the tribe of the Arabs be given him, he will try to find out something about them. The Governmeut of Mohammerah being Arab has sources of information not open to the Turks, and I believe be able to obtain some particulars about these men if the above details were supplied.

Sir, I I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch, No 21 of the 27th instant, and am much obliged for the information therein contained. I am endeavouring to secure the details regarding the tribes and masters of the accused and will communicate them when obtained. I note that Mirza Hamza thinks it probable that Hassan, Yusuf and Shinawah are at lallahiyah and that he will make enquiries and arrest them later if found there. 1 o no however understand the grounds for delay in the matter, or why i wou e inadvisable to arrest them because of the conscription agams t e eni Truf.

As the matter seemed of some urgency, I rode down and saw the Sardar Arfa at Muzaffari on the 28 th. I put him in possession of the statements contained in your letter. In reply, he said that he had already sent down orders for every endeavour to be made to secure any of the culprits concerned in Mr. Glanville’s murder. He would now write again to the same effect. There was nothing would give him, and he was sure Mirza Hamza also, more pleasure than to be able to bring some of them to account. He said that it was quite incredible that Mirza Hamza should have made any statement equivalent to an admission that, even if he found any of the men, he would not arrest them. He may, however, very probably have said that he did not believe that any of them were in Mohammerah. Such charges against Mirza Hamza were probably the work of enemies. He has no dependents who would look to him for protection in such a case. The Shaikh recommended the Turkish authori- ties to take as much interest in the arrest of the numerous culprits still undoubtedly iu Turkish territory, as he would do for the apprehension of any whom he could discover within his own limits. 1 I, of course, assured the Shaikh that we had entire confidence in bis eood will and energy in this matter, but had judged that, iu his own interests, it was due from us to inform him of reports circulating to the discredit of his agents, and so directly inimical to himself. 5 I have, etc., (Sd.)

He, however, asks if these men should be acquitted could you guarantee their release, as the names may have been given to the Turks to get them into their hands for other reasons. I have been told by an Arab, in confidence, that Mirza Hamza has actually arrested the men, but he denies this, and it requires confirmation. No orders have reached Mirza Hamza from Tehran on this subject, the telegraph seldom works and the post generally takes one month. He however says that no orders are necessary. I have impressed on him that the local authorities have now an opportunity of showing their friendship to us, and their conduct in this matter will prove if their friendship is sincere. He protests that he is most anxious to do all in his power to arrest the suspects, and is keeping a watch for Sahar-bin-Ishaq-el*Tama and Nazif-bin*Chubaidh who might come into the districts, as well as for others.

Sir, In continuation of correspondence ending with my No. 22 , of 5 th instant, regarding the Marghil murders, I have the honour to report that Mirza Hamza informs me that he has arrested ’Amara, father of the two Madan suspects, and their brother. Also Nassuri, brother of Shinawah, having failed to find the men themselves. He has ascertained that Hassan-bin-Amara is at Nahr Hauz near Abulkhasib, where he is in the employ of Yasin-bin-Haji Muham mad Amir. The relatives deny that he is implicated, and state that Yusuf-bin Amara was on pilgrimage to Kerbala at the time of the murder, and only returned after the murder of Mr Angurli. They state that this can be proved by Sulaiman Effendi of the Baghdad police, and by Salih Effendi Mudir-es- Sattah at Kerbala. Mirza Hamza has telegraphed to these men and will inform me what reply they give. They state that the Tabur Agassi at Basrah could also prove this, but he refuses to put it on paper, as the man’s name has been given to you as a suspect. Nassuri also swears that Shinawah was not implicated. However, Mirza Hamza has every hope of being able to arrest him. I had already ascertained that these three men of Madan were under the protection of the late Mr. Angurli, whom they supplied with dairy produce. Mirza Hamza says he is certain that these names were given by Dahi, because his arrest was due to Mr. Angurli. In the same way Abdulla the Mukhtar of Kut Eirang smuggled Khalaif away because he swore he would accuse Abdulla’s relations of being culprits, if given up to the Turks. Eurther Mirza Hamza has ascertained that Sahir-bin-Ishaq-el-Tama is in hiding in the junub.Hidal (negro) is at Neshwa on the property of Sowaichid near Garmat AH. Huwailah-bin'Chubaidh and Nazif-bin-Chubaidh were killed in an encounter (at Garmat Ali) with the police a year ago. The Basrah police know this. The following four Madan Arabs were undoubtedly parties to the Marghil outrages. Lutaifah-hin-Muhammad who is in the nur opposite Dair near Garma 11 Ali. Hashiyin el Du’es who is in the bur (marshes) at Garmat Ali. ’Abaid ,» jj ” » bin Khatailah „ » &gt;» *» Mirza Hamza hopes to obtain further information, and says we may rely on him doing all in his power.

In continuation of my No. 24 of the 16 th instant, I have the honour to report that Mirza Hamza has received telegrams from Suliman Effendi of the Baghdad Police that Yusuf-bin-Amara and his sister were there at the end of Zi Hijjah and thence went to Kerbela, and Salih Effendi says that they were there till the 11 th Muharram. This appears to prove his alibi, and Mirza Hamza says that this, with the two dead sons of Chubaidh, shows the sort of evidence the Turks have. They want to get hold of the Madan because they were parties to a tribal fight on which several were killed on each side, as was Shinawah. He says he puts himself in our hands, but this is so evidently a trick to get hold of the men for other reasons, that he would like a guarantee of their release on proving their alibi. This I told him was impossible. I have, etc. (sd,) w. mchouall. (Enclosure No. 10 .) Basrah, April 25 th, 1906 . (Confidential.) No. 34 . Mr. Consul Crow to Mr. Consul McDouall. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch, No. 27 , of the 23 rd instant. It is possible that the evidence adduced by Mirza Hamzaon behalf of the IVIadan may be bond fide. In any case the credibility or incre- dibility of his witnesses does not justify hlirza Hamza in harbouring persons % accused of being accessory to Mr. Glanville’s murder. Any evidence he had in their favour could have been submitted to the Court Martial, which is a compe tent tribunal formed for the purpose of trying them. It was clearly his duty to hand over the accused to the Turkish authorities when he had them in his power, as I understand from your No. 22 of April 5 th was the case on that date. I am reporting the matter to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constan tinople, and I have no doubt that His Excellency will justly estimate the value to be attached to Miraz Hamza’s assurances of assistance. I should be glad if you would take an opportunity of conveying to him my opinion of his action in this matter. I have, etc., (Sd.) E. E. CROW. (Enclosure No. 11.) Mohammerah, May 9 th, 1906 .

Sir, In continuation of correspondence ending with your No. 34 of the 25 th ultimo, I have the honour to report that the Sardar Arfa has returned to Maho and his brother at Hawizeb, who belonged to the gang which committed the outrage at Marghil. They deny that they were there, but admit that they were with the actual culprits some hours previously, saying that they separated from them before they went to Marghil. Eis Excellency says he has arrested them for us and not for the Ottoman authorities, but will do whatever we wish in the matter, and hand them over to us or to the Basrah authorities. He wishes to point out, however, that on several occasions he has handed over criminals to the Turkish authorities and they have allowed the culprits leave on bail after a short detention on payment of a sum of money, thus setting at liberty men with a grievance against him or his officials. In the interest of the preservation of order the execution of these murderers is most neces sary and delay is dangerous : the fact that the outrage on Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer has not yet been adequately punished has already had a bad effect. He further informs me that the others of the gang are with Haji Sabhan, the rebel Shaikh of the Beni Truf in the Hawizeh district, now in the Amara district.

In the meantime, I should be glad if the Shaikh would be good enough to state what is the evidence against the men in question and what proofs of their complicity he has been able to obtain, in order that I may secure their convic tion at the Court Martial.

No. 36 . Mr. Consul McDouall to Mr. Consul Crow. Sir, In continuation of correspondence ending with your No. 37 of the 14 th instant, I have the honour to inform you that there appears to be no direct evidence against the two prisoners. The Sardar Arfahad heard that they had sold some European clothes at Amara Mirjan alias Mulla Muhammad ^ack nowledges that he was with the gang before the attack on Marghil took piace , his brother Mishayil denies that he was, and urged his brother to give the names. The Sardar Arfa informs me that he told them that if they would give the names of the gang he would do what he could for them, otherwise he would deliver them at once to the British man-of-war. Mirjan stated that there were here 16 men, and he heard from them that they were in the outrage. The names he gave are 13 as follows : — Wadi Adhwaihi, Salman Mulla Muhammad (negro). These, with Haji Sabhan of the Bani Truf at Baiyah in the Hawizeh district. Aidan, Sinaisil, sons of Sinaifiand Hidel, their slave at Bagiyil-el-Mishwah. Al Baraij from Baguh at Kut, Haji Mansur in the Shatt-el-Arab. Two ballamchis of Haji Muhsin-el-Sanaiyid. They have a breech-loading gun. Ajwaisim, a Bahreini, and Ajwaisim ibn Muhammad-el-Mamur at Abu Mugharia. Latter owns property there. Abdulla-el-Lighta at Ziraiji.12 The Sardar Arfa thinks, if you approve, it is better that the two men be detained here at present to see the result of the information they have given. In the absence of direct evidence this may be advisable for the present. He 0 said we could postpone discussing the method of handing them over.

Memorandum, of confidential conversation with the Sardar Arfa, May 2 ht, 1906 . Enclosure in No. 38 , of May 21st, 1906 . I explained that it was necessary that the man Mirjan be produced in Jlasrah for cross-examination as to his statement, and confronting him with the others under arrest. I asked whether His Excellency would send the man under a guard to the Consulate at Basrah, or hand him over directly to the Basrah authorities. He said that we knew better than he did whether his sending the man to the Consulate would be according to rule. If* he gave him up to the Turks he would have a written receipt which would be useful for him to have on record, hut if delivered through the Consulate no doubt be could get a paper to the same effect. He has instructions to deliver to the Turks any man they ask for in this connection, hut it is on our account and not on that of the Ottoman or Persian Governments he is assisting. If His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, will send down a launch he will hand over the man to him, or if the Basrah authorities write officially to him, he will hand the man to them. Before this is done, however, he would like either myself or, still better, His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, with me, to see the man here and either examine him ourselves, or listen to his examination of him, so that we should know what statements the man made here, in case that, out of spite, the man should afterwards make other statements implicating innocent men who had been con ducive to his arrest.promise the man liberty, or to be returned to custody if bis statements led to the arrest and punishment of the gang. The man is probably guilty of other crimes. I said we could not promise anything we could not perform, he said he could, in our presence, say to the man that his safety depended on his telling the truth, and asked if such a guarantee was not usual. I said that in England an accomplice, not being the actual murderer, was accepted as King’s evidence under promise of acquittal, but this case was to be tried by the Turks; I would,-however, refer the matter to His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah. Asked if it were not possible to ascertain the whereabouts of any stolen property which might be identified, he said that, after the time that had elapsed, it would be impossible to trace anything, but his information was that European’s coats and trousers and a ring and other articles had been sold in the Amara and Hawizeh districts. He considers that the best chance of obtaining proof against the guilty is to guarantee Mirjan’s liberty, if he gives evidence to prove the guilt of the rest of the gang. He believes that this is a much more likely way of obtaining reliable evidence than any the Turks would employ. I promised to inform His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, of what he said and let him know the reply before proceeding with the question of handing over the prisoner. (Sd) W. McDOUALL. (Enclosure No. 17 .) Statement of information regarding the Marghil murders given to Mr. McDouall by an Arab whose name cannot be given. One of the robbers, son of Shinawa was killed and another wounded in the attack on Marghil. In the morning the traces of blood were visible from Lvnch’s house to the Kut Nassuri, and some small articles from the house were seen This was seen by the police and steps to conceal it taken. Alter tne robberv, the gang went to Nassuri’s house taking with them the dead and the wounded mam Thence they went to the house of one Adhar, at Garmat Ah, where some of the spoil was left but has probably been removed since.

It would he simpler and more usual for him to deal with the Turks direct. It is not feasible for me to send a launch to Mohammerah for the pur pose. As the Shaikh desires I will ask the ^ Acting Wali to apply to him again to hand over any culprits or persons implicated though it seems to me super fluous as Mirza Hamza has several times asked to do without success. It is the business of the Turks to discover the criminals, and as the Shaikh has been instructed by the Persian Government to co-operate with the Turkish autho rities in the matter it seems to me that the essential point is that he should assist us by carrying out those instructions. It would serve no good purpose for me to interfere beyond acquainting the authorities with such information as I receive and watching the proceedings of the Court Martial. As far as the Shaikh’s interests are concerned, I think that your presence or that of your representative at any preliminary examination held at Moham merah is ample for the purpose. You may, if you so desire, send me a copy of any proces verbal made, which I will pass on to the Turks and ask them to give it due consideration, but it is obvious that the Turkish authorities will hold their own enquiry, and I think they are in the best position to judge of the importance of Mirjan’s evidence in relation to the information they already possess. I can, of course, give no guarantee as to how the prisoner will be treated by the Turks, nor hold out any hope as to his acquittal or release. These are matters which concern the Court Martial alone.

The men were brought in separately, and I enclose a copy of the notes taken by me of their examination. All these men were with Haji Sabhan in his late attack on Hawizeh and are believed to be with him still. He is at Bag’ah with Suwai’d in the territory of Ghazban Bani Lam in the Amara district. The Sardar Arfa considers that the authorities should insist on Ghazban giving up these men, and should not accept a denial of their presence there. I have, etc., W.

Prisoner was warned by the Sardar Arfa that the only way he could get out of his present difficulty was by the assistance of the British, and that he could only gain that by telling the whole truth regarding the affair at Kut Firang. Prisoner swore that he would tell all he had heard from them, and stated that he was not at Kut Firang, that he left them and went to Neshwa, they went to Bagayet. A negro, whose name he does not know, went to them and told them that his wife was cook to some Christians at Kut Firang, and she told her husband that there was money there, and he came to meet them and they went to Bagayet to the house of Sanafi. The men were— Aidan and Sinaisil, sons of Sinaifi. Hadel, their slave. Abdulla Lughlaiti of Zairaiji. • Baraiyij from Kut Haji Mansur in the Shatt-el-Arab district.

Asked for other names, he said— Wadi-bin-Sultan of Abu Busairi. Dhwaihi, slave of Mutair of Abul Khasib—now with Haji Subhan. Arrar, a negro slave of Muhaisin, calls himself Mulla Muhammad and is with Haji Sabhan. Sulaiman, a negro slave in the employ of Salih bin Haji Sabhan. Asked what plunder there was, he replied:— Two breech-loading guns, clock, clothing, coats, etc., no money, only 2 or 3 liras. The clock was the share of Dhwaihi, one gun of Arrar the other gun of Sulaiman. There were no Madan. All joined Haji Subhan in his late expedi tion to Hawizeh; they sold one coat at Hawizeh.

Mr. Consul McDouall to Mr. Grant Duff. Sir, With reference to your No. 2 , of the 9 th May, regarding the murder of Messrs. Lynch, Brothers’ engineer near Basrah, I have the honour to reportthat, in the absence of the Sardar Arfa, it appeared _ somewhat doubtful if his representative did all he could to arrest suspects. Finally he arrests one man and the relatives of 2 others at Fallahiyah whose names were given by the * Ottoman authorities. But in the absence of any evidence against them, and as one of them proved an alibi, which was confirmed by my private enquiries, he did not surrender them. The probabilities are that these names were given out of spite by a man already arrested who supposed a man, under whose pro tection they were, had given information which led to his arrest. On the return of the Sardar Arfa he informed me that he had had two men arrested at Hawizeh, who were members of a gang who had been selling some European clothes on the border. One of them admitted that he belonged to the gang, but was not present on the attack on Messrs Lynch s depot. His Excellency said he had orders to hand over to the Ottoman authorities any man asked for in this connection, and was anxious to do all in his power to assist the British in this, not only because his father’s assistance in arresting the pirates of the SS, “ Kashmir ” in 1875 had led to the British Indian vessels firing a gun whenever they passed his house, but because, if such a crime remained unpunished, it would add to the difficulty of preserving order, particularly with regard to the protection of Europeans in his own district and remarked that the unpunished outrage on Colonel Douglas and Captain Lorimer had already had a bad effect in the North of the province. He suggested that one of the men named Marjan should be accepted as King’s evidence. His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, informed me that the enquiry being in the hands of the Turks, he could make no such stipulation with them and it was necessary that the man should be produced in Basrah and cross- examined and be confronted with other prisoners. His Excellency agreed to hand him over to the Turks on the receipt of the official demand for them. He examined the man in my presence telling him that his only chance was to gain the favour of the British by telling the truth. The man gave the names of 13 of the culprits and some particulars showing that he knew something about the matter. It appears that the gang were afterwards engaged by the rebel Shaikh of the Beni Truf, Haji Sabhan, in his late attack on Hawizeh, and most of them are still with him in the Turkish district of Amara.

On my learning from His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, and informing the Sardar Arfa that a clerk, who was wounded at the time of the murder, would be able to identify these men, he gave orders for their surrender, and they were taken charge of by the Turkish police on the 22 nd instant in my presence.

I have received the following telegram from His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah. Begins. The sheikh of Mohammerah is much perturbed at the delay in conveying as surances etc. to him. He points out that his representations have now been for 18 months before Government and in their final shape for one year. He complains that when, at the beginning of the present year, it seemed possible that his action in defence of his own interests might prejudice ourselves in the north,we led him to hope that his request for further assurances were being considered sympathetically but he is still awaiting them. He says that the condition of Persic is meanwhile growing worse and that serious troubles are again imminent and whilst our interests in Ambistan and his responsibilities in regard to them are steadily increasing, he himself, is in no better posi tion than he was before. I hope that there may be no further delay in sending final answer to Sheikh's requests or our position here will suffer thereby. Ends.

(3) Letter from His Majesty’s Consul, Moham merah, No. 560, dated 4th June 1910. 2. Before offering any observations on the contents of the report, I beg to touch upon certain salient points of the recent correspondence and negotiations. (i) Jiie. basis of my own attitude .—The first news I had of there being any thing wrong between the Sheikh and the Wali of Basrah was contained in Lieu tenant Wilson’s telegram No. 404, received 26th April, in which the latter report ed the fact that Zain had been shelled bv the “ Marmaris ”. When I telegraphed to you on the 30th asking that His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, might be instruct ed to co-operate with Lieutenant Wilson in bringing about an amicable settlement, it was only the bombardment of Zain that I had knowledge of, and the amicable settlement which I advocated in regard to that incident was naturally meant to be one which would have regard to the Sheikh’s rights and interests as well as those of the Wall. It was not till later that I received news of the shelling of the Sheikh’s mother’s house ; of the death of one of his wives from the shock of the bom bardment ; of the issue of the offensive circular of April 24th and of the des patch of the two letters to the Persian Consulate-General threatening measures against Mohammerah itself. In my eyes these additional items of news, and the possible further Turkish measures adumbrated by Mr. Crow, enhanced the hostile aspect of the. Wall’s proceedings and the seriousness of the position to an extent which made an amicable local settlement not only unlikely, but also insufficient to meet the case, unless accompanied by a change of Walls. Accordingly, both on the Sheikh’s account and'in our own interests, to which the tranquillity of the river at this season is a condition of the : highest commercial. t Basrah Despatch No. 36 of 8th May .907, to importance, as His Majesty/s. Consul, His Majesty’s Embassy. Basrah, fully recognises,+. I, recommended the despatch of one of His Majesty’s ships to the scene and efforts tolling aboutthe recall of the Wall. These recommendations, however, you felt unable to endorse, for the reasons stated in your telegrams Nos. 107, 11 2 and 116, and the incident has since been disposed of on other lines. ( it) The question as to •whether the proceedings of Wali Suleiman Nazif Bey had justi fication or not ,—l submit that, in order to arrive at a conclu sion on this point, it is not necessary or logical to look back further than the time of Nazif Bey’s assumption of his appointment, at the end of 1909 or begin ning of 1910 ; not necessary, really, to go back further than March 10th, 1910, the date of Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 14 to His Majesty’s Embassy. In the earlier part of this document we are told of the cordial foregathering of the Wali with the Shiekhs of Koweit and Mohammerah at the house of Abdul Wahab Pasha-el-Kurtass and of the banquet, speeches and photographs which followed ; and, while it may be quite true that the host, when delivering his post prandial pleasantries on this occasion, was speaking with his tongue in his cheek as Mr. Crow suggests—just as I fear he was when he expressed the valued opinion quoted in Basrah telegram of 9th k»stant to His Majesty’s Ambassador to the effect that the breach between the Sheikh and the Wali was healed—yet the contents of the last two paragraphs of the despatch are open to no such imputation of insincerity. In them we have an explicit statement from His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah to the effect that there had been no disturbance of importance on the river during the preceding winter ; that Sheikh Khazal had quite recently been exercising his good offices in the endeavour to promote a reconciliation between an important riverain Turkish Arab Chief and the Wali; that the Sheikh had, in fact, been maintaining a generally conciliatory and co operative attitude towards IN azif Bey ever since the latter’s arrival; and that, in pursuit of this policy, he had endured with complacency the intermitent des truction of the house property in Basrah. I may mention too, apart from the above, that I was made aware, by the reports of His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, that the Sheikh had also been endeavouring to promote friendly relations between Nazif Bey and the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. . This was the general position as between the Sheikh and the Wali when I rejoined my post from home on 31st March, and it appeared to me an eminent ly satisfactory one. It was the same when I visited Mohammerah a week later. It seems to me, therefore, that, having regard to the happy terms which admittedly existed between the Sheikh and Wali when Mr. Crow wrote his despatch of a that we have to do, in order to gauge the morality of the Wah s action is to decide whether, subsequent to that date, Sheikh Khazal was guilty of conduct which supplied the Wali with justification for such a sudden and complete change of attitude ; for his discourteous refusal to receive the Sheikh when the later went up to Basrah to visit him on 18th April ; for the pro mulgation of his offensive circular of April 24th, and, finally, for the bombard- rnent of Zain on 25th. It seems to me that no such justification has yet been demonstrated. J In a recent telegram from His Majesty’s Secretary of State, dated 31st May, repeated to me by the Govornment of India, occurs the following pas- The telegram sent by Cox to Legation in answer to Mr. Marling’s tele- treats th® rights and wrongs of the accusations against attitude'’’ ^ ° n ° aCC0Unt ’ 13111 11 15 not Possible to maintain this I think the telegram referred to must be my No. 543 sent in answer to your o. 123 o me. In it I wrote that my attitude towards the action of the Wah would be the same if the accusations against the Sheikh were well founded. If read by itself the sentence does convey the meaning above attributed to it, but I think the full context indicates that it was not quite that attitude which I h , JV ak u- T; 4 My &gt; telegram to you was a reply to Basrah telegrams repeated by His Ma|esty s Embassy to London and to you, in which Mr. Crow had stated that Turkish grievances against the Sheikh were of long standing fl!l S Tr'tn , a J' t0 n hlS , kn0wledge ’ ,he Sheikh had bee ' a thorn in th! e 1 ayet for the last 7 years. It was those accusations, of the basis3 of which I had not full knowledge, which I had in mind when I wrote the said telegram to you, and my line of thought was that, even if they were proved to be well founded, it could not be said that they had anything to do with the Wall’s action in the present instance, which was a separate issue based on incidents subsequent to the date of Basrah Despatch No. 14 of 10th March, which, so far as could be seen from the reports of our officers, afforded no justification for the Wall’s sudden change of attitude towards the Sheikh. In fact, the unjus tifiability of the Wall’s proceedings, on the facts of which we were in possession, was a necessary premise to my attitude, both in this telegram and in my No. 569. Itikr (Hi) The expediency of effecting Nazif Bey's recall. —As to the degree of difficulty involved to His Majesty’s Embassy or Government in advising or urging the Porte to change a particular Wall, I quite recognise that you had full personal knowledge while I have none. I could only urge reasons which, from a local standpoint, seemed to me to demonstrate the expediency of the course advocated, both on the Sheikh’s account and in our own interests. On the Sheikh’s account because, on the information before me, whether from Basrah or Mohammerah, the aggression of the Wali seemed deliberate and uncalled for, and because human nature being what it is, it was not conceivable to me that, after what had happened, his relations with Nazif Bey could ever again be sincere or satisfactory. In our own interests because, apart from the general tendency with which he credits most Turkish officials of the new regime, Mr. Crow had described Nazif Bey as being personally impetuous, inexperienced as a Governor, and most undiplomatic ; and also because, in the short time during which the latter held office, he had displayed an attitude of mind actively and specifically opposed to our interests and policy at the head of the Gulf, as the following instances will demonstrate (a) As regards Koweit and Mo hammer ah.—Both publicly and privately Nazif Bey has declined to admit any right on the part of our Consulate at Basrah to discuss with him matters concerning either port, and he is reported to have expressed publicly, on several occasions, his resentment at British inter ference in Koweit affairs in the past, and his determination not to put up with it in future. We further know from independent sources that he has been making overtures to the Sheikh of Koweit in order to induce him to admit a Turkish Telegraph Office in Koweit connected by a land-line with Basrah or Fao; and, on another occasion, to allow Koweit subjects to be enlisted in the Hasa gendarmerie. (b) As regards Bahrein. —Although instructed from Constantinople not to protest actively against our assertion of protective rights over the principality, speaking for himself, Nazif Bey “ emphatically stated that he could not admit that the British Government had any rights of supremacy over Bahrein ” (vide enclosure to Embassy Despatch No. 6980, dated February a&amp;fcfo, i9 IO » to His Majesty’s Foreign Office). Vit (c) As regards Baluchistan. —I have it from His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, that a few days after taking up his post, Nazif Bey issued a noti fication in Basrah to the effect that Baluchistan, being an independent state, the pretentions of Foreign Powers to protect Baluchis would under no circumstances be recognised, and that they would be treated as Turkish subjects. Mr. Wilson understands that this question is under reference to His Majesty s Embassy. It is true that a new Wali might have been equally aggressive, equally inclined perhaps to pursue a policy opposed to our interests ; but I think the probability rather is that he would have been less assertive, while it is hardly possible that he could have been more so. I find it difficult to understand Mr. Crow’s view that the recall of the Wali would endanger the security of the river. Sheikh Khazal has been entirely amenable to our advice and guidance throughout his recent troubles with the Wali, and but for that fact, the Wall’s action at Zain would certainly have been followed by a rising of Arabs and consequent insecurity on the river. Had thepresent Wali been replaced at our instance by a less aggressive man, the Sheikh would have recognised the value of our mediation, and would have had no interest of his own tQt serve,,, still less excuse to give us, for disregarding our guidance and lending his ear to the overtures which he received from the rest less Arab element on the river. \X wll be OP^d frpjm Lieutenant Wilson’s report that these were by no means lacking. (tv) The question of' policy involved.^-k\\s Majesty’s Government have had difficulty in forming a definite opinion on the actual situation owing to the fact that the views of His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, and myself, on the subject, were opposed. His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, is accredited to a Turkish port, dwelling in a Turkish atmosphere, and hearing only Turkish reports and the Turkish side of the question, while His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah^ and I perhaps, only see from the Persian point of view and only hear the Persian version. We are all equally entitled to be anxious that the interest of the country to which we are- accredited should not be overlooked, but l submit that a quarrel like the present cannot be regarded purely as an isolated Turko-.Persian incident, and no con sideration be given to its bearing on British interests and British policy ; and that in regard to thedatter, such a wide divergency of opinion as would appear to exist among us should not be possible. I think I am right in believing that, under the present conditions of general international politics, our strongest interests in the Gulf are now focussed at the head of it, and that our chief interest|in Persia lie in Mohammerah territory and Arabistan. I have, in the course of. some years’work in the Gulf, arrived at a fairly clear personal conception of' what the policy of His Majesty’s Government is in regard to this region, and it is at-any rate-one which has had the vindica tion of success in the direction of commercial progress and advantage, which is the main object pf any policy. I must confess that I, cannot see how the atti tude evidenced in Mr. Crow’s letter No. 46, or in his telegrams repeated, by Bis Majesty’s Embassy to, the Foreign Office under their N.os. 94 and 95, can be regarded as in harmony wjth it. Even if be were convinced that the Shaikh of Mohammerah had by his. conduct richly deserved the hogtility of the Wali, Isub- mit that the British interests and position affected would have been better served by his conferring %t an earlier stage with our representative at Mohammerah, by urging us to use influence' with the Shjeikh, and by doing his utmost to restrain the Wall in the meanwhile rather than by adopting the attitude he did, especially after his cordial testimony of icth March to the Sheikh’s conciliatory behaviour; and in view of the fact that the proceedings of the W T ali, which he approved, must seriously affect or react in the jurisdiction of a fellow Consul as well as his own. That the Wali should’ possibly go through with his arbitrary action by attacking F-ailiyah or other means, and that- His Majesty’s Consul should ask the British Embassy at Constantinople to press for him to be well equipped for the purpose, might serve purely 1 urkish interests and might, if Mr. Crow is correct in his belief, be salutary for the Sheikh of Mohammerah, but encouragement to such a policy seems to altogether to disregard British interests in Mohammerah territory and the British position at the head of the Gulf, both of which are inevitably affected, and both, of which it i$ the function of us all to safeguard and promote. 3 I am now brought to the Sheikh’s reply, to the particular accusations of recent date quoted by-the Wali as to the causes of his hostile action, and to the general accu^ations of the Basrah authorities and Mr., Crow with reference to years past. It' has added to the difficulties of the recent situation that the Sheikh him self was away, out of personal touch with His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, or-myself, and that, in^is absence, his, interests had to reckon with ap apparently he^avy accumulative record of grievances recorded against him in the archives of His Majesty’s, Embassy, necessarily based pn information from Turkish sources, and, as far as he is concerned, ex parte, I must be pardoned for exhibiting some anxiety lest the merits of his case should suffer in his absence from thiscause. It was from an analogous anxiety, and because I realised the weak position in which Haji Rais found himself when he proceeded to Basrah, that I was slow to take for granted that the onesided solution which he had provision ally to accept at the hands of the Acting VVali would be acquiesced in by the JSheikh. Sheikh Khazal has now returned and had an opportunity of stating his^ own case, and 1 can best leave Lieutenant Wilson’s record of it to speak for itself. In any case, in the matter of detail, I can add nothing. In regard to the incidents of recent occurrence, the Sheikh’s replies seem to be satisfactory and to confirm the view that the Wall had no real justification for his action. In regard to the events of past years, Sheikh Khazal lays no claim to complete blamelessness, nor has it been claimed for him. As you are aware, so far as his own territory is concerned, he has been a considerably more en lightened ruler than his predecessors, and during the chaotic times of the last few years his districts have been the most secure and best governed in Persia. As ruler of a border province, and as an Arab landholder in lurkish territory, he has always had a very difficult part to play vis a vis the Turkish authorities at Basrah, and, left entirely to his own devices by the Central Government, has had to protect his own interests and those of his tribesmen in the best way he could.. It has been in the main a matter of self-preservation, and I do not think^that the description of the position given in paragraph ! 7 of Lieutenant Wilson’s letter, is an overstatement of the straits to which he has at times been reduced, and for which the rottenness of the provincial Turkish administration has been directly responsible. 1 quite agree that, as the Porte, under the new regime reforms her administration in the Basrah Vilayet, so must the Sheikh of Mohammerah modernise his ideas of border relations, and I believe he will do so under our friendly influence and guidance. On the other hand, hasty and aggressive methods, such as those pursued by Wali Nazif Bey, (if in reality his action can be looked upon merely as the vagary of an impetuous administrative official), are only calculated to defeat their own object. But can the Wali’s proceedings be considered in the above light at all ? The river generally was perfectly quiet at the time of the Zain incident and had been for a long period before, and the measures taken by Nazif Bey were not in the least necessary for the attainment of his professed object, the maintenance of order in the Basrah Vilayet. It seems much more probable that, except as a pretext, riverain affairs had nothing to do with the Wali’s proceedings, and that the real motive for them is rather to be sought in the fact, suggested by His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, some weeks before the present difficulty arose, that the Turkish authorities 1 would not be sorry for an excuse to cause trouble to Persia weak and disorganised as she is” ; a view to which the concluding sentence of telegram No. 71 from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople to the Foreign Office affords some corroboration. The position is not difficult to understood. The Turks have been able _ to encroach successfully on Persian territory on the Northern portion of the Frontier. At the Southern end they have been powerless to do anything of the sort, firstly, because the Sheikh of Mohammerah can manage the Arabs in his^ own territory, and secondly, because, as an Arab, he has strong influence also with the lurkish Arabs living near the frontier, from whom the lurks would consequently get little sympathy or assistance. Thus, from one side of the border we see that the power of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and his ability to look after himself constitutes the only bulwark on which Persia can reply to preserve her from Turkish encroachment on er South-West Frontier; while from the other side we find that he (with the Sheikh of Koweit indirectly) is the only obstacle to the furtherance of Turkish designs or national policy in the same region. The Porte has thus a patent motive for seeking to attenuate the Sheikh’s power and detach his Arab adherents from him, and the simplest means of effecting that object is for them to make things un pleasant for the Arab tribesmen living near the Frontier and endeavour to show them, now that they (the Turks) have some force at their command, that the Sheikh can no longer help them in their difficulties, as of old.The Porte could hardly have selected a better opportunity for giving practical expression to this policy than the present occasion. Nazim Pasha had just arrived at Baghdad with large powers and a flourish of trumpets. At Basrah they had recently replaced an Arab Governor ^ by an assertive *' Young Turk ”, Their gunboat “ Marmaris ” was in working trim. In the other camp the juncture found Sheikh Khazal in bad odour with a Cabinet at Tehran, dominated by a Bakhtyari Chief also anxious, both for personal and tribal reasons, to harm the Sheikh and reduce his power. It was even suggested, you will remember, that the Persian Government or Majlis had been previously approached and squared before the attack on the Sheikh’s village took place. Lastly, the instrument selected by the Wall was an excellent one for the purpose, owing to his personal importance as a tribal leader and to his close relations with Sheikh Khazal. The Wali must have known very well that he could not expect such a man to submit to arrest by a handful of gendarmes ; just as he knew well enough that it was not possible for the Sheikh to hand over his own tribal elder and brother-in-law to the Basrah police. This mere fact no doubt supplied the necessary pretext for the use of the “ Marmaris The Wali’s own behaviour since the incident is quite in harmony with the above theory. He was cordially welcomed by Nazim Pasha at Baghdad, and so far from proving amenable to any influence, or persuasion applied by Mr. Crow in order to induce him to express regret to the Sheikh, he almost indignantly rejected his overtures and refused to entertain at all the question of personal amends on the ground that he had only acted under instructions and there had been nothing personal in the matter. But, whether the Zain incident was a personal vagary of the Wall’s, or a premeditated plan emanating from the Porte, the fact remains I submit, that it is our interest and our policy to maintain the Sheikh of Mohammerah in his position as a powerful Arab Ruler at the head of the Gulf. So sure as we do not, our own position will suffer with his, and damage to his influence and well-being will react upon the prosperity of our commercial stake in his territory. I cannot see, therefore, that we have any object to serve in encouraging assertion of “ national rights ” on the part of the Turks, and I venture to hope that, after considering the Basrah and Mohammerah reports regarding the recent incident, His Majesty’s Government will feel able to enunciate some common lines of policy for the guidance of our Consuls at Basrah and Mohammerah, by the joint pursuit of which they will be able to keep the Turkish authorities and the Sheikh within constitutional bounds, and, by doing so, will jointly safeguard our position and great interests at the head of the Gulf. 4.

You should go through with him the Turkish accusations against him, and record fully what he has to say in reply to them, and his version of the Basrah- Mohammerah question generally, for the information of Government. We have never had it from the Sheikh himself. As regards the co-operation required by the Turks, is there any particular item in regard to which he is unable or unwilling to comply ?

I have the honour to state that, in compliance with your telegrams No. 467, dated 8th May 1910, and 549 of 25th May 1910, I have gone into the question of the Turkish complaints and allegations against the Sheikh of Modiammerah with the latter, and now record below, for your information, his replies to the various allegations and complaints made against him by the Wali of Basrah, together with a translation of his letter in reply to the latter. I also submit a precis showing the progress of the negotiations between the Sheikh and the Wali, and the attitude adopted by His Majesty's Consul, Basrah, and myself, at each stage. I have also included his replies to various allegations set forth by Mr. Crow, which, though not coming officially from the Turks, may be presumed to show the attitude of the latter towards the Sheikh. I would^ invite a reference to my despatch No. 441—37, of May 7th, 1910, to His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran, on the subject of the dispute between the Wali and the Sheikh. 2. I have also added, where it seemed necessary, my own comments and those of Mr. McDouall, as recorded in the archives of the Consulate. The Turkish allegation is shown in every case in the margin, with an indication of the precise document in which it was contained. 3. The Sheikh replies that it was never alleged, as far as he knows, that any The Sheikh promised to arrest them if they were in his territories. He at once sent agents in all directions, and in four days time heard that three of them were in the Mohammerah District. He induced them by stratagem to come to Failiyah, and imprisoned them.

The Wali, about 15th April, 1910.) in connection with the Minawi incident.8 unexpectedly, and naturally, particularly as the Sheikh was away, the handing over of these persons was delayed. A fourth was subsequent^ obtained. They '' were handed over on 31st May. They were all Arabs from Basrah and uncom nected with Mohammerah. Chelmeran, Turkish landowner, killed on his lands by his own labourers dose to Basrah. Mur derers said to have fled to Mohammerah, and not to have been given up. (Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 22, dated 22nd April 1910.) The Sheikh replies that the Wah wrote to him on this subject, and that he had promised to do his best, though no proof was offered that the murderer was in his lands. He has had search made every where with no result. The Basrah police in the first place made no serious effort to catch the man, and the story that he has fled to Mohammerah was, he says, probably invented by them to explain their own remissness. Chelmeran was an old friend of the Sheikh and of his house, and he looked on him as an adherent. Were even Persia and Turkey at war, the Sheikh says he would hand over his. murderer to the Turks. The latter have not given him the slightest indication of their reasons for saying that he has fled to Mohammerah, and m any case, they only suggested it some time after the murder. 5. The Sheikh says this is untrue. Many criminals, fugitives from justice, are re ported to be in Mohammerah, and when Sheikh is asked to hand them over he refuses to do so (Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 22, dated 22nd April ipl 0 -) Mishri, a Turkish landowner, applied to the Turkish authorities in the usual way to remove certain cultivators from his lands at Dawasir, but without success, and trespassers were supported by Muhammad Chanan, an adherent of the Sheikh. (Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 22, of 22nd April 1910 ) N. B .—This is a complaint against Muham- med Chanan, not against the Sheikh, He asks who “ reports ” them to be in Mohammerah ? If the Turks want individuals from him they have only to name them, specify their offence, and satisfy him that the accused are Turkish subjects. He has frequently handed over even Persian subjects in a friendly way. Let the Turks produce a list, and give their reasons for making such sweeping statements. He absolutely denies the receipt of any list, such as that referred to in Mr. Crow’s letter No. 46, of 27th April, to me, and Mr. Crow himself now say$ he has no confirmation whatever of the statement that the list was sent. This, the Sheikh says, is simply a repetition of the reply the police in Basrah make to every succeeding Wali, when taken to task for their remissness, thus creating bad blood between Mohammerah and Basrah authorities. 6. The Sheikh’s position in this case is best shown by the following extract from Mr. McDouall’s Despatch No. 55 of Sheikh lefused or prevaricated over surrender „ .fU Anril T onn • of persons concerned in Mr. Glanville’s murder in April IQUy . 1906, (Maghi 1 cise). (Mr. Crow’s Despatcn 17, of 10th March 1909, and No. 22, of 22nd April 1910.) “ As to the Maghil case, I do not agree with Mr. Crow’s opinion that the Sheikh did not assist. My opinion was that he did, but it is always very difficult to arrest men of the marsh Arabs, who are protected by their friends: as to the two men, there was reason to suspect that they were wanted by the Turks for other reasons ”. Mr. McDouall’s 18 years’ experience of Mohammerah entitles him to speak on the subject with authority. See also Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 25 of 7^ May 1910. When the alleged murderer was brought to Basrah, he was allowed to escape a few days alter. The Turks’ record in the Maghil case is so bad that they cannot throw stones at the Sheikh, and the above complaint is, as a matter of fact, that of Mr. Crow, not of the Wali. 7 . The Sheikh replies that the t( trespassers,” whom Mishri tried to have removed in the “usual way,” were sub jects of his own, and belonged to the Persian tribe of Haji Faisal. Mishri was trying to cheat the cultivators referred to out of their legal rights. The Sheikh did his best for some time before the matter came to a head to settle things amicably between Mishri and the cultivators, but without success. Mishti then proposed to replace them with other Arabs, of the tribe of Muhammad Chanan, but the latter tribal chief refused to let any men of his tribe replace Haji Faisal’s_ men, as this would give rise to a blood-feud, or at least to much bitterness. Mishri was very angry at this, and made a big case of it. He told lies to the Wali, and to the9 police, and, as far as the Sheikh can make out, the story of his or of his Agent’s life being threatened by Muhammad Chanan is based solely on Mishri’s word, or that of the police, Muhammad Chanan did not no so, nor any responsible person. 8. The Sheikh replies that Muhammad Chanan is a Persian subject, that he Reference above complaint, the Turkish police were informed when they tried to arrest Muhammad Chanan that he and all his people belonged to Sheikh, and could not come to Basrah (to be imprisoned), and if arrest was insisted on, Mishri’s Agent would he killed like Chelmeran. (Mr, Crow’s Despatch No. 22, of 22nd April 1910). wrote as much to the Wali at the time. The Tabur Agassi, (police sergeant), went to Zain to arrest Muhammad Chanan, but alleged no specific offence, except that he had been annoying Mishri, who is a tyrannical and grasping man. Tabur Agassi and Muhammad Chanan both came in the same helium to visit the Sheikh at Failiyah and to discuss what should be done, over a friendly cup of tea. Tabur Agassi made no complaint of any kind whatever as to threats, but simply said that Muhammad Chanan said he was a Persian—r would the Sheikh write to this effect to the Wali? Sheikh at once wrote a friendly and polite note to the Wali, saying that the Tabur Agassi had seen him on the subject of Muhammad Chanan, that the latter was a Persian subject, but that nevertheless the Sheikh would bring him up to Basrah in two days’ time to discuss the matters at issue, and arrange a settlement. He added that he would be going up the Karun shortly, and would take the opportunity to M ask permission to take his depar ture,” a particularly deferential and courteous phrase. He was, he says, under the impression, when he wrote the letter, that the Wali was on the best of terms with him. He went up to Basrah two days later and found to his surprise that the Wali now refused to receive him at all unless Muhammad Chanan was forthwith handed over to the police. The Sheikh pointed out in vain that he was accused of no specific offence, that he was a Persian, and that the case of Mishri was eminently one for amicable settlement. The Wali was obdurate. Wali said he distrusted the Sheikh. His influ ence as a landowner and tribal Sheikh was great, and he thought most of the Mukhtars from Gurnah to Fao were in his pay. or pledged to his interests. (Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 22, dated 23rd April 1910). He had no alternative but to return to Mohammerah with Muhammad Chanan, who, it should be added, is his brother-in-law, and head of the most important of the tribes round Mohammerah. 9. The Sheikh replies that more than half of the tribes from Gurnah to Fao happen to be of the Sheikh’s tribes and are Persian subjects: the Sheikh in consequence has great influence, and since Mukhtars are always chosen, by the Turks, from the headmen of the locality, it is not surprising if they are in a way pledged to the Sheikh’s interests. But, he points out, there is no reason to suppose that the Mukhtars are in any way hostile to the Turks influence, and in support of this, and of his own consistently peaceful policy, he points out that the Arab tribes from Gurnah to Fao are the only ones who never give any trouble to the Turks ; they pay their taxes regularly, and are probably as law abiding a community, in their stage of civilisation, as can be found anywhere. The limit of the Sheikh’s influence, Gurnah, is also that of the Turks’ authority. Beyond the point at which the Sheikh’s influence ends, the Turkish authorities have failed to collect revenue for the last three years, and are still engaged in ineffective punitive operations. 10. The Sheikh’s reply shows that he himself has always attributed the “Wali attributed all the river troubles from Fao to Basrah to Sheikh’s influence, and was putting in his own men as “ Mukhtars in place of Sheikh's men ” (Fide supra.) river troubles to the same cause as Mr, Crow did in his Despatch No. 17, of 10th March 1909, of which the following is an extract u As long as action is confined to mere perfunctory police enquiries, and reference is made to a so-called criminal court, where no justice is obtainable, while local authorities are allowed to throw dust in our eyes by arresting offenders and sentencing them to expiate the offences of guilty defaulters, the lawless condition of Basrah will not improve.” 11. In this connection it may not be out of place to refer also to Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 8, of January 30th, 1907, to Sir N. O’Conor, reporting a piracyfrom a British Indian sailing vessel at Abul Khasib. He states that he asked the authorities to capture the pirates and recover the stolen property. The Turkish official at Abul Khasib failed to report the outrage, and no energetic measures were taken ^ until 4 telegrams from the Grand Vizier, as well as one from the Sultan’s Private Secretary, had been received. Even then, the men arrested were not the real culprits, but men who had incurred the enmity of the police bv complaining of their misdoings to Constantinople. ^ 12. Mr. Crow’s Despatch No. 36, of 8th May 1907, to Sir N. O’Conor is also of interest in this connection, as showing that, at that time, river troubles were due to Turkish bad faith with the Arab tribes and troubles in Basrah to the inefficiency of the Administration. In the latter regard I may Quote the following:— ' J ^ “ There is no improvement in public security. * * jyj r Hickey, the British subject who was attacked and robbed by an armed force of brigands * * on May 3rd, narrowly escaped being stabbed. * * The police were not, and never are, on the spot, the gendarmes charged with patrolling the streets are absent from their posts and view these incidents from a safe distance, being much too callous to interfere, or what is still more likely) in league with the robbers themselves. House after house is looted with impunity, while the Turks waste valuable time in fruitless judicial enquiries and in the pursuit of robbers who seem well-known, but who invariably elude the mock vigilance of the executive officers.” * 3 - Ag ai n, m 1908, during Mr. Geary’s tenure of the office of Consul in Basrah, several piracies occurred in the Shatt-el-Arab, which formed the subject of complaint by Mr. Geary to the then Wali. In one case only was it suggested that the Sheikh’s Arabs were responsible, and, on enquiry at Mohammerah it turned out that, though the boatload of pirates pushed off from and returned'to the Persian shore, it w as believed that they did this to hide their identity as Arabs on the Turkish side were reported a few days later to be dividing the spoil. No action was taken by the Turks, and the wwiter was informed by Mr. Geary himself that the nerveless and corrupt administration of the Basrah Vilayet was in his opinion^ responsible for the disturbances. J ' T-rf Shei ^ h ma y be excused for doubting that the situation, in 1910, is radically different from that described above by Mr. Crow. He adds that a still commoner method of the police, and likely to be popular in proportion to the efficiency of the courts of justice, is to assert that the criminal has fled to Persian rT S • statement ’ in hls letter to me of 27th April, that he has repeatedly, in previous years, drawn the attention of His Majesty’s and u* the at . tltU D 6 of l th . e Sheik h in regard to river troubles generally, of tl « r / ln P a u ra AT m , P artlcular &gt; is not supported by the archives w th h M ate ‘ r eyond the Ma §bil case, (vide paragraph 6), and the troubles with Moharrem Bey reported in Mr. Crow’s Despatch No 17, of 10th apffinst I t?ip^h O '^h nSta ^ lt ' in0 u le, i ^ r * Crow seem s to have made no complaints nftnfflo; H t ? heik ^’ and in the latter case h e apparently did not think the matter iVot to ^ warran t his sending a copy of his Despatch on the sub- hv tho 1 .. a i eS J s onsu l, Mohammerah. The first intimation received the Rp&lt;;ido' f r f r 38 u- a C /°^ ? i^i 6 - despatch in question received from BaohdadW \u UShl ^ ( Wh0 had himseIf received it from the Resident at gn ad), together with a request for an expression of view in the subject. 15* This is the crux of the accusation against Muhammad Chanan which led to the attack on Zain, and was the fans et origo malV\ though it is wholly denied by the Sheikh. I have made most careful enquiry from several sources, and am unable to obtain any confirmation of the Wall’s statements. it is inherentlv aC f! C n0t °, n ^ can * °b ta i n no corroboration, but also it inherently improbable that he w^ould do such a thing, since practically all the Muhammad Chanan Opoo?ed a detachment sent atter him for attacking several farms. ( Wdi’s letter to 1 ersian Consul-General No. 18.) Muhammad Chanan committed aggression on Turkish lands, threatened to kill the owners, collec ted an armed force to oppose the gendarmes of the state, and supported rebellion. (Acting Wall’s letter of loth May.)farms are in the hands of his own fellow tribesmen. The Sheikh’s version is that Muhammad Chanan would not let his men replace those whom Mishri wanted to turn out, and I believe this to be correct. Mr. Crow tells me he has no infor mation in corroboration or otherwise of the Wali’s statements on this subject. That he committed aggression in Turkish lands, is, as far as I can ascertain, untrue. What kind of aggression ? That he threatened to kill the owners, is, as has been said above, an accusation simply based on hearsay. In this con nection the Sheikh draws attention to the fact that it was the murder of Mishri’s Agent which was first said to have been threatened by Muhammad Chanan. Later, the accusation was that it was Mishri himself whose life was said to have been threatened. Muhammad Chanan was not present at Dawasir at the time, and denies that he ever said such a thing. It is, of course, conceivable that one of his irresponsible followers may have done so. The last accusation that Muhammad collected an armed force to oppose the gendarmes of the State, is unsubstantiated by any evidence that I can obtain, and Mr. Crow tells me that, beyond the Wali’s statement, he has heard nothing of it. The Sheikh says, and it is impossible to doubt him in this circumstantial particular, that the Tabur Agassi and Muhammad Chanan came to his place in the same boat, and discussed the question in quite an amicable way, no com plaints being made on either side. It is, therefore, difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Sheikh is fully warranted in saying that there was nothing against Muhammad Chanan that could not have been settled by half an hour’s conversation with the Wali, as he tried to arrange. Had the Wali. instead of discourteously refusing to see the Sheikh at all on the subject, discussed the question with him, and heard the other side, things would undoubtedly have turned out very differently. The Sheikh believes that Mishri has a spite against Muhammad Chanan because the latter would not let his men act, in the English working man’s parlance, as “ blacklegs,” and that he induced the Wali to believe that Turkish rule was be ing flouted by Chanan. 16 17 16. The principal chronic accusation made against the Sheikh by the Turks is that he exercises illegitimate influence in Turkey. The influence of the Sheikh in Turkish territory is due to the fact that he is the titular head of more than half the Arabs occupying the Turkish bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and expects, and, in a large measure, receives implicit obedience from them. He is a large landowner, with more extensive property on the Turkish side of the river than is possessed by any Turkish subject. He owns valuable house property in Basrah, and, though it has been considerably diminished in value in the last few months by the Wali’s expropriation schemes in connection with new roads, the Sheikh has not allowed the question to interfere with his friendly relations with the Wali, {vids Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 14, of 9th March 1910), asking only to be treated as well as British subjects were being treated. Had he adopted a hostile attitude to the Wali on this point, he would have secured the support of the influential families in Basrah, and might have embarrassed the Wali very seriously. Again, when the news of the attack of the Wali on the Sheikh’s properties was spread abroad, the latter received numerous voluntary offers of active assis tance and co-operation from almost every important Turkish Arab Chief from Amara to Fao. Had he accepted them, and commenced active reprisals against the Turks, he would, I have no doubt, have gravely embarrassed the Turkish Government in Mesopotamia and secured his object, the dismissal of the Wali. Realisation of this fact is not, however, in my humble opinion inconsistent, as Mr. Marling suggests in his telegram No. 31, dated 31st May, with a recog nition by the Sheikh that the rising naval power of the Turks would overwhelm him in the end, unless he could count on the support of His Majesty’s Govern ment. 17. The other important general accusation against the Sheikh is that he has, in the past, connived at or instigated the perpetration of outages in Turkish territory.The Sheikh does not entirely deny this charge, but he admits /when Mnhaiv rem fc tey was Wall of Basrah, ana onl^ it only in connection with the period (1909) / ThTegira to two or three occasions. He justifies humself by pointing out that Moharrem Bey was a violent and ill-tempered man with whom personal dealings t\ were an impossibility. The Persian Government was then, as now, hopelessly disorganised and unable to make any effective representations at Constantinople ; the Persian Consul-General was equally unable to say anything to the Wali of Basrah, and was, in any case, incompetent. The Wali committed with impunity acts of grave injustice against the Sheikh and against his subjects living in Turkish territory. Protests proved of no avail, and the petitions which the people of Basrah sent to Constantinople asking for the removal of the Wali were unanswered. Deprived of all diplomatic weapons, unable, by reason of Moharrem Bey’s personality, to discuss things with him in a friendly spirit, the Sheikh had recourse to the only means at his command to secure what was, in his eyes, the only remedy—the removal of the Wali. He was successful as the Wali was re moved shortly afterwards, and the Sheikh’s action had the support of the people of Basrah to whom Moharrem Bey had been equally obnoxious. 18. The Sheikh, in winding up the conversation, emphasised the fact that his specific grievances against the Turks were numerous and likely to be more serious in the future than at present. The Turkish officials were, he said, pursu ing a policy of pin pricks in regard to him and his tribe, and causing great an noyance to the* latter. Extortion, arbitrary action by Turkish officials against Arabs on the ex parte statements of avaricious Turkish landlords were now every day incidents and the constant subject of complaints to him. The present Wali seemed,, he said, to be bent on putting all sorts of impracticable laws into force amongst Arabs, upsetting the status quo and the tranquillity of the country side, not apparently in order to remedy the state of affairs, but solely in order to cause trouble amongst peaceable Arabs, whilst at the same time he took no serious steps to bring to book those tribes such as the Muntafik, who openly defied his authority. CoJ&gt;jy of a reply of the Sheikh of Mohammerah to the Acting Wall's letter of 16th May 1910. Dated 25 th Jamadi-ul-Awwal, 1328 . From—KHAZAL bin JABIR, To—The Wali of Basrah. After compliments.—'Your letter of 3rd Rabi-u-Sani, No. 133, which your Agent, Saad Bey, sent me reached me on the Karun and the contents have been noted. Regarding the acts which you did at Kut-i-Zain, on account of the threatening by Muhammad Chanan of the Tabur Agassi and the Gendarmes, whom you had sent to see him. I am much surprised at your account of the matter. On this account, that when the Tabur Agassi came with Muhammad Chanan to Failiyah to see me, he made no complain^ and made no mention of such acts. As we are united and friends, I do not want to say more on this subject. Were I to do so, I am sure that I should be vindicated, and your sense of justice would corroborate me. What happened at Kut-i*Zain is not hidden from you. Moreover, Muhammad Chanan, as is well known, is a chief of the Muhaisin tribe, and a Persian subject, and he was my agent in Zain, for the care of my lands there. In accordance with your agent’s letter, 1 have removed him, and will replace him by another person. Regarding those who attacked and killed Chelmeran. From the first day that I heard the news, I give the necessary orders in my own districts to search for and capture the murderers, but they have not up to date been found, and do not belong to the people of this district. If a single one of them comes into my district, he will be seized and handed over.Regarding the Minawi incident. When you mentioned the matter to me, l gave the necessary orders, and one day before my departure to the Karun I captured three of them. As I was on the point of leaving, I could not inform the Vilayet, and on my return in the same way I captured one more of them, and informed the agent of the Vilayet that he might send an agent to take them over. A reply was received, an agent sent, and the men handed over. With regard to what you wrote about handing over fugitive criminals, on this matter a treaty exists between Turkey and Persia, and I am a Persian subject, and hereditary warden of the frontier, and Your Excellency is no doubt aware of the Treaty- Therefore, I and Your Excellency cannot give undertakings contrary to the Treaty, but in view of the friendly relations that exist between us, in the past and in the future in all matters relating to the prevention of trouble, in no way has any fault been found, nor will be in the future. No evil acts have hitherto been committed by my tribes in Turkish terri tory. As far as possible I will make extreme efforts for the preservation of peace and security there, and to that end l consider myself responsible. And whenever you desire to conclude a personal agreement between us, relating to the above treaty between the two Governments, I am at your service. MEMORANDUM. The following memorandum is intended to supplement the documentary narrative of the troubles which have recently arisen between the Sheikh of Moham- merah and the Wali of Basrah, and to explain briefly the action of the writer vis a vis the Sheikh of Mohammerah and His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah. The first intimation that any trouble was likely was conveyed to me on 24th April by a copy of Mr. Crow’s despatch No 22 of 23rd April 1910, to His Majesty’s Embassy, detailing an interview which he had had with the Wali, in w 7 hich the latter, after making a series of complaints against the Sheikh, annunced his intention of sending the gunboat “ Marmaris ” to Zain to demons trate, and, if necessary, punish Muhammad Chanan and his retainers. The Wali further said that he intended to take strong action. Remarking from this despatch that Mr. Crow had made no protest to the Wali against his proposals, and had not considered the matter of sufficient immeidate importance to justify a telegraphic report to Constantinople, I hurried to Basrah forthwith (April 24th) to attempt to induce Mr. Crow to take action to dissuade the Wali from carrying out his plans. It was, however, too late, as the Wali had already sent the 4 ‘ Marmaris ”, and, in any case, Mr. Crow seemed disinclined to take action, and suggested that the Wali was not in earnest. I, however, prevailed upon him to send a wire to Constantinople on the subject. On my return to Mohammerah at midday, on April 25th, t found that the “Marmaris” had shelled and burnt Muhammad Chanan’s village an hour previously. I at once proceeded to the spot with a representative of the Sheikh, ascertained precisely what had occurred, telegraphed the facts to the Resident at Bushire, and returned the same evening to Basrah to see Mr. Crow again and inform him of what had occurred. Previous to going to Basrah, however, I visited the Sheikh’s principal men in Mohammerah and warned them to do nothing whatever, and to allow no reprisals pending orders from the Sheikh who had proceeded to Ahwaz on 21st instant. On arrival at Basrah, I found that Mr. Crow had heard nothing of what had occurred at Zain, and he did not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situa tion that it created. In reply to my letters of 24th and 25th he answered, on the 27th, that the day of reckoning for the Sheikh had come, and that, though the action of the Turks might be arbitrary, he would press for them to be supplied with the proper means to carry it through. He, however, modified his attitude to some extent, as, when he attended a reception by the Wali held on the “ Marmaris”, he listened coldly to the Wall’s triumphant remarks on the subjectof the gunboat’s action and, (at he informed me), told the Wall that his impetu ous action was ill calculated to secure the results ostensibly desired, and that he would have done well to consult His Majesty’s Consul before taking action. The Wali shortly afterwards left for Baghdad where he was to meet Nazim Pasha, under whose general control he now is. He received an exceptionally cordial and distinguished reception. The Sheikh meanwhile, at Ahwaz, telegraphed for advice to me as to whether he should return to Mohammerah at once or not. I replied that he should not return at present as his precipitate arrival on the scene would certainly create a lively anticipation of reprisals, the expectation of which might induce the Wali to pursue his hostile policy still further. My fears were confirmed by the Wali’s letters about this time (20th April) to the Persian Consul-General at Basrah, in which he threatened to attack Mohammerah. As the Sheikh is guaranteed by us against unprovoked attack by sea, he at once, on learning of this letter, telegraphed to Mirza Hamza to beg me to tele, graph to Bushire asking that we would support him in accordance with our pro mises, by sending a gunboat to Mohammerah to protect him from attack by sea, and to show the Turks that we could not tolerate any such action. Tnis sug gestion was negatived by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, and luckily the Wali did not carry out his threats. The Sheikh feels acutely our refusal to send a gunboat, in spite of the fact that an attack on Mohammerah was officially threatened by the Wali unless Muhammad Chanan was surrendered. The refusal has detracted from the value in his eyes of our assurances, since, on the only occasion when we have been asked to render him prompt support, we have withheld it for fear of giving umbrage to the Turks On 5th May, Haji Rais, the Sheikh’s righthand man, who had been sent down by the Sheikh with instructions to consult me as to the advisability of proceeding to Basrah to interview the Wali, arrived from Nasiri With my con currence he went on to Basrah, though in a state of considerable trepidation for his personal safetv. The Wali had by this time left for Baghdad and Haji Rais accordinglv visited the Acting Wali and by his intermediation effected a temporary settlement with the Wali, the Acting Wali giving him a letter to the Sheikh, offer ing to resume amicable relations on certain conditions. The letter contained much that was objectionable to the Sheikh, threats and unjustified allegations being freely intermingled with polite phrases. But Haji Rais, in the weak position in which he was, having clearly understood from Mr. Crow that His Majesty’s Consul had no authority to press the Wali to descend from the position which he had taken up, felt bound to accept it as assuring a temporary cessation of hostilities. He was, moreover, plainly informed (he told me) by Mr. Crow that his orders “ to promote an amicable settlement ” did not, in his opinion, justify any attempt to put active pressure on the Wali. I agreed wuth Haji Rais that this being the case the settlement w r as the best ad interim arrangement procurable, pending a decision by His Majesty’s Government on the general question, audit was represented to and regarded by the Sheikh in this light. Further negotiations were then delayed for a fortnight pending the return of the Sheikh from Ahwaz, where he was occupied in reconciling the Arab tribes near Dizful to each other, with a view to preventing disturbances there. On the C4th May he returned from Ahwaz, and I at once communicated to him Foreign Office Telegram No. 137, (received May 14th), stating that serious representations had been made in Constantinople, and that a gunboat would be held in readiness in case it should be required for the protection of Mohammerah territory. This announcement did a good deal to improve the bheikh’s state of mind and gave him reason to hope that the eventual settlement provided would have adequate regard for his rights and prestige as well as for those of Turkey. The Sheikh consulted me as to the tenour of the reply which he should send to the Wali in answer to the Acting Wali’s letter of 1 ith May. I outlined a reply which seemed to he suitable, and he concurred with me unreservedly. 1 then submitted the outlines of the proposed reply for the approval of the Resident. 1 also sent a copy to Mr. Crow who, in reply, informed me that, with a few minor alte r ations, he considered the reply unobjectionable.In the meanwhile I received orders to proceed to Basrah to con r er with Mr. Crow with a view to a settlement on the lines of Foreign Office Telegram No. 165, (received Tehran, May 26th), z.£., “ Sheikh to promise to give up Turkish criminals and not foment disturbances. Wall to express regret for injury to Sheikh’s family and assure him that, if he keeps his promises, his tribes and property will not be molested ”, The Sheikh was quite ready to do his share on these lines, though he does not admit that he has sheltered Turkish criminals nor habitually fomented dis turbances in the past. The Wali, however, was at some pains to make it perfect ly clear that he would not accept Mr. Crow’s intervention in the matter, and that he would not apologise in any way. This being the case, and the Wali being on his way back to Basrah, the Sheikh saw at once that, to delay his reply until the question of the Wali offering an expression of regret had been disposed of, would be injudicious. Pending receipt of the approval of His Majesty’s Government to his proposed reply to the Wali, he asked the Turks to send men to take over 4 criminals for whom they had applied. These men reached Basrah, as intended by the Sheikh, two days before the arrival of the Wali, thus avoiding any slight to the Acting Wall, who had taken part in the preliminary negotiations for their surrender. On 2nd June, 2 days after the return of the Wali, I was informed by Colonel Cox, in his telegram of 30th May, to the effect that the Sheikh’s proposed reply was approved, and I at once told the Sheikh to send it off. On the 4th June he accordingly sent Haji Rais, his righthand man, to Basrah with the reply, (a copy of which is appended to my letter forwarded here with) The Wali received Haji Rais politely and seemed not dissatisfied with the Sheikh’s reply, to which he sent a polite answer. His protestations of friendship and his expression of hope that the Sheikh would let “ bygones be bygones” were unfortunately considerably discounted by several occurrences which took place whilst Haji Rais was in Basrah as the guest of the Wall. In the first place, a law suit in which one Mustafa, a servant of Mirza Hamza, the Sheikh’s Basrah Agent, was concerned was revived and warrants issued for the man’s arrest, regardless of the fact that, during the negotiations between Haji Rais and the Acting Wali, the latter had obtained the withdrawal of the case and had promised that no more should be heard of it. Haji Rais was informed by the Wali, in reply to his protest, that the latter knew nothing of the Acting Wall’s action in the matter, and, in any case, could not intervene in judicial questions. Haji Rais, however, understands that the Wall himself requested that the case should be re-opened. Secondly, for the third time since the troubles between the Sheikh and the Wali began, the Sheikh’s houses on the Ashar Creek were partly pulled down, in spite of the fact that they did not project into the roadway, and that their frontage had been some time back formally approved by the Wall. When re presentations were made to the Wali on this subject, he said on each occasion that it was a mistake on the part of a subordinate official and that he would issue orders to prevent its recurrence. But it is remarkable that such mistakes should not have been made in the case of other persons’ houses. Haji ais urt er tells me that he has definite information that the Wali instigated these acts. Lastly, whilst Haji Rais was in Basrah an official of the Courts of Justice with a band of soldiers raided the empty house of the Sheikh’s Basrah Agent and forcibly distrained his carriages and some other possessions, on the ground that a summons for debt had been issued against him by Government for pay ment of /300 but had been disregarded. The Wali denied all know edge of the matter and ordered the return of the goods distrained But Adbul Wahab al Kartass has told Haji Rais that the case was started by the Wall himsHf in revenge for Mirza Hamza’s attitude in regard to the Sheikh s house property in Basrah and that the Wali personally interested himself in obtaining a judgment against'Mirza Hamza; the latter states, however, that no summons ever reached him. The cumulative effect of these incidents has been to convince the Sheikh that the present Wali is hopelessly unreliable, if not actually treacherous, and&gt;6 that as long as he remains in Basrah there will be no guarantee of a recurrence of troubles such as have occurred recently, unless the Turkish authorities both in Basrah and Constantinople are given plain intimation that His Majesty’s Government are supporting him and will not tolerate aggression on Mohammerah territory. Mr. Crow has given Haji Rais plainly to understand that he is unable to intervene in Basrah affairs, where the Wali is acting ostensibly in conformity with judicial administrative rules, and the Wali has not less plainly informed Mr. Crow that he will not tolerate his intervention in Mohammerah and Koweit affairs. It is important that it should be fully understood that the Sheikh has every thing to lose and nothing to ?ain by gratuitously opposing the Wali of Basrah and no one realises this better than he does. The value of the personal property which he inherited from his father on the Turkish bank of the river is probably not less than J million pounds, and it is not reasonable to suppose that as long as the Wali treats him with tolerable consideration he wid court difficulties in connection with his property, or jeopardise the peace and prosperity of his tribal tenants by lightly incurring the hostility of the Basrah authorities. In the case of the Wali, the position is quite different. He may have an easier task when he is on good terms with the Sheikh, but he has the support of his Government when he is not. He is here to-day and gone to-morrow and has no personal stake or local interest, and for the rest is imbued with the chronic Turkish idea that the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit are the chief obstacles to the realisation of Turkish ambition to reduce the Arab population of Turkish Arabia, the condition of serfs destitute of any hereditary right to the land which they occupy. I should add, finally, that I showed His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah the draft of the letter to which this precis is appended, and asked him whether he had any information which would tend to refute or throw doubt upon the genuineness of the Sheikh’s replies to various allegations made by the Turks. He replied that he was not now, and never had been in a position to sift the truth of the allegations made by the Turks, that the latter were invariably untruthful, and that, situated as he was in Basrah, he had no opportunities for applying an independent test to the accounts given him by the Turks of the recent troubles or of others He added that should His Majesty’s Embassy ask him to submit evidence in support of the Wali’s allegations or of his own statements, he would suggest that the Turkish Government were in a better position than he to furnish such controversial material. I should add that Mr. Crow’s dragoman is a Turk, and obtains his informa tion from Turkish sources, and that circumstances usually seem to preclude Mr. Crow from obtaining the views of Arabs on current issues, even if he desired to know them. With reference to my telegram No. 37, of the 9th instant, I have the honour to transmit a translation of the Sheikh of Mohammerah's reply, which Haji Rais handed to the Wali on Sunday morning, June 5th. Haji Rais Mohammerah; The 4th Jane igio. A. T. WILSON, Lieutenant, I.A., Acting Consul. No. 35 - Sir, Basrah ; June Qth, jgio.i7 visited me the same evening and, according to his account, the Wali gave him a friendly reception, kept him to lunch and discussed the Zain business and general relations with Mohammerah unreservedly. Both parties gave their respective versions of the immediate events which led to the breach, and the Wali remarked, inter alia,) that local reports had been sent to Constantinople complaining that he left the administration of outlying districts too much in the hands of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and said he had been censured by Constantinople in consequence. He read and accepted the Sheikh’s written reply to his letter without comment, saying merely that he had nothing against the Sheikh personally, but he wanted his loyal assistance to catch Turkish criminals who escaped to Mohammerah and professed himself willing to reciprocate if Persian criminals fled to Basrah. He added he would not allow the Police to take advantage of the friendly understanding between the Sheikh and himself in order to make a scapegoat of Mohammerah whenever they failed to catch culprits, and said applications for surrender would only be made in well authenticated cases, alter careful enquiry and production of satisfactory evidence of the parties’ guilt. He assured him that friendly rela tions with the Sheikh were now restored. Haji Rais asked the Wali to write a friendly private letter to the Sheikh to that effect, and the Wali undertook to do so. Haji Rais also referred to the partial destruction of some of the Sheikh’s new buildings on the Ashar creek, and the Wali agreed to examine the ground in his presence on the following day and see what was required. I called on Abdul Wahab el Kartass at Saraji, about 3 miles down river, on June 6th, and discussed the affair with him. He is an intimate friend of Sheikh Khazal’s and is well aware of all that has lately occurred. He agreed to visit the Sheikh at Mohammerah as soon as Haji Rais had returned and inform me how matters stood. Haji Rais called again on me in the evening. He brought me a copy in Arabic of the Sheikh’s reply and showed me a sealed private letter, which he had received from the Wali for the Sheikh, of which, however, he did not know the contents. He said he had come to an amicable understanding with the Wali about the Sheikh’s new houses and had arranged to stop all work .until the Vilayet engineer had drawn up a plan of the proposed new quarter to ■ work upon. Haji Rais then left for Mohammerah. I called on the Wali on Tuesday morning, June 7th. I had not met him since his return from Baghdad, on June 1st. He was friendly and polite but observed a frigid silence in regard to the Mohammerah question. When I broached the subject, he expressed deep resentment at my interference, and could not believe that tlie British Government, which had helped Turkey so much in past years, was now going to turn against it on account of the little Sheikh of Mohammerah. He said he could not conceal the great ^ surprise my letters had caused him and that he was prepared to meet any criticism of his acts provided it came from the proper quarter, namely his own Department. He was astounded that I should have represented ^the Sheikh of Mohammerah as being interested in the affair of Kut-el-Zain, as that locality was part of Turkey and the brigands who were harboured there were Turkish subjects. He remarked that he had directed the Acting Wali to accept no interference from me in the matter, either official or private, as the question in^ no way concerned England. He then went onto tell me that, before his appoint ment as Wali, he had been Editor of the “ Tesvir Efkiar ” and was quite aw courant) not only of events in Persia, but also of English foreign politics, and he proceeded to give me a lengthy and somewhat journalistic account of his views on these subjects. His arguments, however, as far as I could measure them, seemed as wide of the matter in hand as they were removed from the precincts of reason. I replied that I was sorry we were such an interfering people; unavoidably we had our finger in many pies but this need not disturb the excellent relations which existed between ourselves, and I merely wanted to tell him what the18 Foreign Office said about this Mohammerah business. I said we were glad to hear he had effected a reconciliation with the Sheikh and were obliged to him for meeting us in the matter. I had already communicated the views not of myself, but of His Majesty’s Government on this subject to the Acting Wali. I had received many telegrams from the Foreign Office, our Embassy at Constantinople and the Legation at Tehran, and all agreed on the necessity of arranging matters amicably between himself and the Sheikh. His Majesty’s Government wished the affair dealt with locally, and I now desired, with his permission, to communi cate the instructions l had received. As to the matters in dispute His Excellency had communicated directly with the Sheikh, letters had been exchanged and friendly relations re-established. I had twice written privately to His Excellency regarding some expression of regret on his part to the Sheikh for his personal family trouble. His Majesty’s Government thought it would be well, in order to strengthen and confirm the good understanding now arrived at, “ if His Excellency would express in a friendly and private manner his regret, that is to say, his condolences for the personal injury sustained by the Sheikh, namely, the death of his wife, and the discomfort caused to his mother and would assure the Sheikh that, if he kept ( his promises, his tribes andh is property on Ottoman soil would not be molested.” I read this passage to him and offered to give my Turkish translation, but he said he prefered to have it verbally. I also carefully explained to him that His Majesty’s Government did not ask for an apology fof what had occurred but simply an expression of regret for the Sheikh’s private trouble, and I pointed out that, although we fully realised the difficulties of the Turkish Government on the river, we were old friends with the Sheikh as with Turkey, and if we had not protected the Sheikh in his dealings with the Persian Government, Mohatnmerah and Arabistan would have gone to the dogs long ago. We were deeply interested in Arabistan where we had about half a million of capital invested, and we wanted no quarrels between the Governors of Basrah and Mohammerah. We were prepared to use our influence with the Sheikh to keep him from fomenting disturbances on the Turkish side, but if he did not keep his promise we should certainly not protect him. The Wali answered that he had practically fulfilled the second part of our request as he had written privately to the Sheikh on the preceding day and assured him of his friendship and good will and protection of his affairs in Turkey and assurances to the same effect were given in the last paragraph of his previous letter, (see enclosure 3 in my despatch No 26, of May 14th, to the Embassy), but he firmly, though politely, declined to write anything to the Sheikh in the form of condolence or regret for the Sheikh’s personal concerns, with which, he said, he had nothing to do. He declared himself convinced that his action at Zain was justified and fully vindicated by past history on the river and, as the action was undertaken on behalf of his Government and had nothing personal about it, any personal expression of regret on his part would be useless and meaningless. I replied that His Excellency must decide for himself and that I could do no more than reiterate the express wishes of His Majesty’s Government, which I had been instructed to explain to him, and I would communicate his views to Constantinople. I again visited Abdul Wahab el Kartassat Saraji on the morning of the 9th instant and he told me he had spent several hours with the Sheikh of Moham merah at Failiyah on the preceding day and had read the Wall’s private letter, which, he said, was friendly and conciliatory. He said good relations were restored and the breach healed. 1 consider Abdul Wahab’s opinion of value. He is an important personage here and an intimate friend of Sheikh Khazal, and is well aware of the difficulties the Turks have had in the past years with Mohammerah. No man in Basrah knows the position better and, when friendly meetings between Arab Sheikhs and Turkish Walis occur, they are generally held at his house. Please see my despatch to the Embassy No, 14, of March 9th last, to which the Resident at Bushire recently referred in his telegrams. I have, etc., F. E. CROW. His Excellency the Right Hon’ble Sir G, A. Lowther, K.C.M.G., C.B., etc., etc., etc. fJune 10th. P.S .—Since writing the above, I have received a copy of the Wali’s private letter to the Sheikh and enclose a translation of it. In forwarding the letter to me Mr. Wilson states that the Sheikh attaches no importance to the expression of regret and does not want it now. F. E. C. 8th June igio. My dear Crow, Yours of 8th. I have handed over 2 halters to Lyold Scott &amp; Company, Limited, to be sent up to you by first opportunity. I will let you know what the cost is later. I enclose a copy of the letter of the Wali to the Sheikh. The Sheikh now says that he cares little for apologies as the Wali is so impetuous that to force him to give them from Constantinople would only make things worse. We have tried once and failed, and in his view, to try to work it from the Porte, even if successful, would do more harm than good. But he is most anxious that we should insist both in Basrah and in Constantinople on our right to intervene in Mohammerah affairs being recognised fully by the Wali. That, he says, will be the best guarantee against trouble in the future. I quite agree with him, and shall do my best in Bushire to get the Resident to press this point of view on His Majesty’s Government. He tells me that the Wali has publicly announced that he will not tolerate the interference of His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah in any affairs either at Koweit or at Mohammerah. He says that the Wali is not only impetuous but treacherous, as his conduct in relation to Sheikh Khazal’s house, which has been three times quite needlessly pulled down, after having been repaired. Haji Ra.is says he had definite proof, when in Basrah, that the Wali knew all about it. Regarding the seizure of Mirza Hamza’s property in Basrah by order of the Court, of which the Wali disclaimed all knowledge to Haji^ Rais, it now appears that the claim for ^300 was commenced by the Wali against Mirza Hamza in revenge for his attitude on the house question, and that the Wali has secretly instigated the proceedings all along. This is our side of the question. I think the Wali is altogether instable, and that nothing but trouble will arise as long as he remains in Basrah. Yours sincerely, . A. T. WILSON. « G. C. B.

He is anxious that the assurance already given to him and subsequently extended to his heirs and successors may be modified so as to apply to his male descendants. 2 . He desires that the assurances given should be made to hold good for 100 years. 3 . He desires an assurance of protection for his private property in Persia. 4 . He desires an assurance of protection against molestation by foreign Powers and against any encroachment by such a Power on his jurisdiction, recognised rights or property in Persia. 5 . He hopes that, if circumstances compel His Majesty’s Government to assume control of the customs of the southern ports of Persia, including those of Mohammerah and Ahwaz, he will be left in immediate control of these two ports as at present. ^ ^ 6 . He hopes that, if a general catastrophe in Persia compels His Majesty’s Government to intervene in the southern part of that country, be and his tiibesmen may be maintained in their present position or, if that is impossible, that he may retain his personal revenue and be granted an asylum in India or elsewhere. ^ 7 . He wishes the assurances given him to be embodied in a form which he can show to his tribesmen, to strengthen both their support of himself and their faith in the friendly policy of His Majesty’s Government. As regards ( 1 ), His Majesty’s Government see no objection to compliance with the sheikh’s wish, on condition that the assurances given shall only hold good so long as his male descendants not only fulfil their obligations to His Majesty s an e ersian Governments but reruain acceptable to their tribesmen. . , ,, As regards ( 2 ) His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that this concession should not be made, at any rate for the present. n . • , ,• As regards ( 3 ) His Majesty’s Government see no objection^ to granting an assurance of the kind desired, subject to the condition laid down m t e succee Pa^ As P reeards (4) His Majesty’s Government are willing to comply with the sheikh’s wish on condition that the assurance is accompanied by a verbal explanation, to be recorded in writing, that they cannot bind themselves to forcible intervention on is As regards ( 5 ) His Majesty’s Government consider it undesirable to give such an assurance and prefer to confine themselves to general expressions o goo wi w ic should be conveyed to the sheikh when the assurances aie gi\en im.

I may add that, should the sheikh’s statement appear satisfactory, a suitable opportunity will he taken of conferring on his Excellency the insignia of a K.C.I.E. in accordance with Colonel Cox’s suggestion, a favour which cannot fail to be pleasing to him, and which will at the same time afford to His Majesty’s Government, if necessary, a pretext for intervention on his behalf. In the meanwhile, however, no mention of this intended grant should be made to his Excellency. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. 1 Enclosure in No. 1. Text of Assurances to be given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. “ I AM authorised to inform your Excellency that whatever change may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment by the Peisian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. “ In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power or against any encroachment by such a Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia.” (In giving these two assurances, Colonel Cox should add a verbal explanation to the effect that, while His Majesty’s Government are perfectly sincere in their intentions towards the sheikh, and have therefore given him these assurances, yet circumstances might arise in which it would be impossible to intervene by force on his behalf. In such a case he would of course receive the strongest diplomatic support. Colonel Cox should record in writing the substance of the conversation in the course of which this intimation is made to the sheikh.) “ These assurances are given for yourself, and are intended to extend to your male descendants so long as you and they shall not have failed to observe your obligations towards the Central Government and shall continue to be acceptable to your tribesmen, to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to them.” The text of the document handed to the sheikh for the information of his tribesmen would be precisely similar with the omission in the last paragraph of the words “ to be acceptable to your tribesmen.” It would also be unaccompanied by any verbal explanation.

Sir, Busllire, June 16, 1910. IN accordance with instructions received from His Majesty’s charge d’affaires, Tehran, I have the honour to submit direct, for your information, a copy of my despatch No. 40/1607, dated the 16th June, 1910, to his address, giving cover to a communication, with enclosures, received from Lieutenant Wilson, His Majesty’s acting consul, Mohammerah, in which he presents the sheikh’s rejoinder to the charges made against him by the Bussorah authorities, and adds a memorandum of his own. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, His Majesty’s Consul-General for Ears. &amp;c. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Cox to Mr. Marling. (No. 40/1607.) Sir, Bushire, June 16, '’910. IN continuation of the telegraphic correspondence, I have the honour to Su ^mit, for your information, a copy of a communication (with enclosures and my telegrams leading up to it) addressed to me by Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, His Majesty’s acting consul at Mohammerah, in which, after personal communication with the sheikh on the latter’s return from the Kanin, he presents the sheikh’s rejoinder to the Turkish allegations both particular and general. 2. Before offering any observations on the contents of the report, I beg to touch upon certain salient points of the recent correspondence and negotiations. (i ) The Basis of my own Attitude. The first news I had of their being anything wrong between the Sheikh and the Yali of Bussorah was contained in Lieutenant Wilson’s telegram No. 404, received the 26th April, in which the latter reported the fact that Zain had been shelled by the is Marmaris.” When I telegraphed to you on the 30th asking that His Majesty’s consul, Bussorah, might be instructed to co-operate with Lieutenant Wilson in bringing about an amicable settlement, it was only the bombardment of Zain that I had knowledge of, and the amicable settlement which I advocated in regard to that incident was naturally meant to be one which would have regard to the sheikh’s rights and interests, as well as those of the vali. It was not till later that I received news of the shelling of the sheikh’s mother’s house, of the death of one of his wives from the shock of the bombardment, of the issue of the offensive circular of the 24th April, and of the dispatch of the two letters to the Persian consulate-general threatening measures against Mohammerah itself. In my eyes these additional items of news, and the possible further Turkish measures adumbrated by Mr. Crow, enhanced the hostile aspect of the vali’s proceedings and the seriousness of the position to an extent which made an amicable local settlement not only unlikely but also insufficient to meet the case, unless accompanied by a change of valis. Accordingly, botfi on the sheikh’s account and in our own interests, to which the tranquility of the river at this season is a condition of the highest commercial importance, as His Majesty’s consul, Bussorah, fully recognises,* I recommended the dispatch of one of His Majesty’s ships to the scene, and efforts to bring about the recall of the vali. These recommendations, however, you felt unable to endorse, for the * Bussorah despatch No. 36 of May 8, 1907, to His Majesty’s Embassy. [2824 /—2] -»Ttn«o*T COPY TO ! A Breasons stated in your telegrams Nos. 107, 112, and 116, and the incident has since been disposed of on other lines. (ii.) The question as to whether the Proceedings of Vali Suleiman Nazif Bey had justification or not. I submit that, in order to arrive at a conclusion on this point, it is not necessary or logical to look back further than the time of Nazif Bey’s assumption of his appointment at the end of 1909 or beginning of 1910; not necessary, really, to go back further than the 10th March, 1910, the date of Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 14 to His Majesty’s Embassy. In the earlier part of this document we are told of the cordial foregathering of the vali with the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah at the house of Abdul Wahab Pasha-el-Kurtass, and the banquet, speeches, and photographs which followed; and while it may be quite true that the host, when delivering his post-prandial pleasantries on this occasion, was speaking with his tongue in his cheek, as Mr. Crow suggests— just as I fear he was when he expressed the valued opinion, quoted in Bussorah telegram of the 9th instant to His Majesty’s Ambassador, to the effect that the breach between the sheikh and the vali was healed—yet the contents of the last two paragraphs of the despatch are open to no such imputation of insincerity. In them we have an explicit statement from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah to the effect that there had been no disturbance of importance on the river during the preceding winter; that Sheikh Khazal had quite recently been exercising his good offices in the endeavour to promote a reconciliation between an important riverain Turkish Arab chief and the vali; that the sheikh had in fact been maintaining a generally conciliatory and co-operative attitude towards Nazif Bey ever since the latter’s arrival; and that in pursuit of this policy he had endured with complacency the intermittent destruction of his house property in Bussorah. I may mention, too, apart from the above, that I was made aware by the reports of His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah that the sheikh had also been endeavouring to promote friendly relations between Nazif Bey and the Yali of Pusht- i-Kuh. This was the general position as between the sheikh and the vali when 1 rejoined my post from home on the 31st March, and it appeared to me an eminently satisfactory one. It was the same when I visited Mohammerah a week later. It seems to me therefore that, having regard to the happy terms which admittedly existed between the sheikh and the vali when Mr. Crow wrote his despatch of the 10th March, all that we have to do in order to gauge the morality of the vali’s action is to decide whether subsequent to that date Sheikh Khazal was guilty of conduct which supplied the vali with justification for such a sudden and complete change of attitude ; for his discourteous refusal to receive the sheikh when the latter went up to Bussorah to visit him on the 18th April; for the promulgation of his offensive circular of the 24 th April; and, finally, for the bombardment of Zain on the 25th. It seems to me that no such justification has yet been demonstrated. In a recent telegram from His Majesty’s Secretary of State dated the 31st May, repeated to me by the Government of India, occurs the following passage :— The telegram sent by Cox to legation in answer to Mr. Marling’s telegram No. 133 treats the rights and wrongs of the accusations against the sheikh as of no account; but it is not possible to maintain this attitude.” I think the telegram referred to must be my No. 543, sent in answ T er to your No. 123 to me. In it I wrote that my attitude towards the action of the vali would be the same if the accusations against the sheikh were well founded. If read by itself, the sentence does convey the meaning above attributed to- it, but I think the full context indicates that it was not quite that attitude which I sought to take up. My telegram to you was a reply to Bussorah telegrams repeated by His Majesty’s Embassy to London and to you, in which Mr. Crow had stated that Turkish grievances against the sheikh were of long standing and serious, and that to his knowledge the sheikh had been a thorn in the flesh of the vilayet for the last seven years. It was those accusations, of the basis of which I had not full knowledge, which I had in mind when I wrote the said telegram to you, and my line of thought was that, even if they were proved to be well founded, it could not be said that they had anything to do with the vali s action in the present instance, which was a separate issue based on incidents subsequent to the date of Bussorah despatch No. 14 of the 10th March, which, so faras could be seen from the reports of our officers, afforded no justification for the vali’s sudden change of attitude towards the sheikh. In fact, the unjustifiability of the vali’s proceedings, on the facts of which we were in possession, was a necessary premise to my attitude both in this telegram and in my later No. 569. (iii.) The expediency of effecting Nazif Bey's recall. As to the degree of difficulty involved to His Majesty’s Embassy or Government in advising or urging the Porte to change a particular vali, I quite recognise that you had full personal knowledge while I have none. I could only urge reasons which, from a local standpoint, seemed to me to demonstrate the expediency of the course advocated, both on the sheikh’s account and in our own interests. On the sheikh’s account because, on the information before me, whether from Bussorah or Mohammerah the aggression of the vali seemed deliberate and uncalled-for, and because, human nature being what it is, it was not conceivable to me that after what had happened his relations with Nazif Bey could ever again be sincere or satisfactory. In our own interests because, apart from the general tendency with which he credits most Turkish officials of the new regime, Mr. Crow had described Nazif Bey as being personally impetuous, inexperienced as a governor, and most undiplomatic ; and also because in the short time during which the latter held office he had displayed an attitude of mind actively and specifically opposed to our interests and policy at the head of the Gulf, as the following instances will demonstrate :— (a.) As regards Koweit and Mohammerah. —Both publicly and privately Nazif Bey has declined to admit any right on the part of our consulate at Bussorah to discuss with him matters concerning either port, and he is reported to have expressed publicly, on several occasions, his resentment at British interference in Koweit affairs in the past and his determination not to put up with it in future. We further know from independent sources that he has been making overtures to the Sheikh of Koweit in order to induce him to admit a Turkish telegraph-office in Koweit connected by land-line with Bussorah or Fao ; and, on another occasion, to allow Koweit subjects to be enlisted in the Hasa gendarmerie. (b.) As regards Bahrein. —Although instructed from Constantinople not to protest actively against our assertion of protective rights over the principality, speaking for himself, Nazif Bey “ emphatically stated that he could not admit that the British Government had any rights of supremacy over Bahrein ” [vide enclosure to embassy despatch No. 6980, dated the 28th February, 1910, to His Majesty’s Foreign Office). (c.) As regards Baluchistan. —1 have it from His Majesty’s consul, Mohammerah, that a few days after taking up his post Nazif Bey issued a notification in Bussorah to the effect that Baluchistan being an independent state, the pretensions of foreign Powers to protect Baluchis would under no circumstances be recognised, and that they would be treated as Turkish subjects. Mr. Wilson understands that this question is under reference to His Majesty’s Embassy. It is true that a new vali might have been equally aggressive, equally inclined perhaps to pursue a policy opposed to our interests, but I think the probabilit}? rather is that he would have been less assertive, while it is hardly possible that he could have been more so. I find it difficult to understand Mr. Crow’s view that the recall of the vali would endanger the security of the river. Sheikh Khazal has been entirely amenable to our advice and guidance throughout his recent troubles with the vali, and but for that fact the vali’s action at Zain would certainly have been followed by a rising of Arabs and consequent insecurity on the river. Had the present vali been replaced at our instance by a less aggressive man, the sheikh would have recognised the value of our mediation, and would have had no interest of his own to serve, still less excuse to give us, for disregarding our guidance and lending his ear to the overtures which he received from the restless Arab element on the river. It will be noted from Lieutenant Wilson’s report that these were by no means lacking. (iv.) The question of Policy involved. His Majesty’s Government have had difficulty in forming a definite opinion on the actual situation owing to the fact that the views of His Majesty’s consul, Bussorah, and myself, on the subject, were opposed.t Hio Maiestv’s consul, Bussorah, is accredited to a Turkish port, dwelling m a Turkish atmosphere and hearing only Turkish reports and the Turmsh sideof the question, while His Maiesty’s consul at Mohammerah and I perhaps only see from the Persian point of view and only hear the Persian version We are all equally entitled to be anxious that the interests of the country to which we are accredited should not be overlooked but 1 submit that a quarrel like the present cannot be regarded purely as an isolated lurko- Persian incident, and no consideration be given to its bearing on British interests and British policy ; and that in regard to the latter such a wide divergency ot opinion as would appear to exist among us should not be possible. I think I am right in believing that, under the present conditions of general inter national politics, our strongest interests in the Gulf are now focussed t e ea d °f h and that our chief interests in Persia lie in Mohammerah territory and Arabistan. I have in the course of some years’ work in the Gulf arrived at a fairly clear personal conception of what the policy of His Majesty’s Government is m regard to this region and it is at any rate one which has had the vindication of success m the direction of commercial progress and advantage, which is the mam object of any policy. I must confess that I cannot see how the attitude evidenced m Mr. Crows letter No. 46 or in his telegrams repeated by His Majesty’s Embassy to the Foreign Office under their Nos. 94 and 95 can be regarded as in harmony with it. Even if he were convinced that the Sheikh of Mohammerah had by his conduct richly deserved the hostility of the vali I submit that the British interests and position affected would have been better served by his conferring at an earlier stage with our representative m Mohammerah, by urging us to use influence with thee sheikh and by doing his utmost to restrain the vali m the meanwhile, rather than by adopting the attitude he did, especially after ms cordial testimony of the 10th March to the sheikh’s conciliatory behaviour ; and m view of the fact that the proceedings of the vali, which he approved, must seriously affect or react in the inrisdiction of a fellow consul as well as his own. _ That the vali should P assl ^y go through with his arbitrary action by attacking Failieh or other means, and that His Maiesty’s consul should ask the British Embassy at Constantinople to press for him to be well equipped for the purpose, might serve purely Turkish interests and ml ght, i Mr. Crow is correct in his belief, be salutary for the Sheikh of Mohammerah, but encouragement to such a policy seems to me altogether to disregard British interests m Mohammerah territory and the British position at the head of the Gulf, both o w ic are inevitably affected, and both of which it is the function of us all to sa eguar an 3. I am now brought to the sheikh’s reply, to the particular accusations of recent date quoted by the vali as the causes of his hostile action, and to the genera accusations of the Bussorah authorities and Mr. Crow with reference to years P as h It has added to the difficulties of the recent situation that the sheikh himsel was away, out of personal touch with His Majesty’s consul, Mohammerah, ormysei , an that in bis absence his interests had to reckon with an apparently heayy accumua ive record of grievances recorded against him in the archives of His Majesty s Embassy, necessarily based on information from Turkish sources, and, as far as he is concerne &gt; ex parte. I must be pardoned for exhibiting some anxiety lest the merits of his case should suffer in his absence from this cause. It was from an analogous anxiety, an because I realised the weak position in which Haji Bais found himself when he procee e to Bussorah, that I was slow to take for granted that the one-sided solution whicn e had provisionally to accept at the hands of the acting vali would be acquiesced m y the sheikh. . Sheikh Khazal has now returned and had an opportunity of stating his own case, and I can best leave Lieutenant Wilson’s record of it to speak for itself. In any case in the matter of detail I can add nothing. , In regard to the incidents of recent occurrence, the sheikh’s replies seem to e satisfactory and to confirm the view that the vali had no real justification for is action. In regard to the events of past years, Sheikh Khazal lays no claim to comp e e blamelessness, nor has it been claimed for him. As you are aware, so far as ms o^n territory is concerned, he has been a considerably more enlightened ruler than i predecessors, and during the chaotic times of the last few T years his districts have een the most secure and best governed in Persia. As ruler of a border province and as an Arab landholder in Turkish territory he has always had a very difficult part to p a) vis d vis the Turkish authorities at Bussorah, and left entirely to his own devices y ^ central Government, has had to protect his own interests and those of his tnbesmei in che best way he could. It has been in the main a matter of self-preservation, an do not think that the description of the position given in paragraph 17 of Lieu enan -Wilson s letter is an overstatement of the straits to which he has at times been reduced, and for which the rottenness of the provincial Turkish administration has been directly responsible. I quite agree that as the Porte under the new regime reforms her ^administration in the Bussorah vilayet, so must the Sheikh of Mohammerah modernise his ideas of border relations, and I believe he will do so under our friendly influence and guidance^ On the other hand hasty and aggressive methods such as those pursued by Vali Nazif Bey (it in reality his action can be looked upon merely as the vagary of an impetuous administrative official) are only calculated to defeat their own object. But can the vali’s proceedings be considered in the above light at all ? The river generally was perfectly quiet at the time of the Zain incident and had been for a long period before, and the measures taken by Nazif Bey were not in the least necessary for the attainment of his professed object, the maintenance of order in the Bussorah vilayet. It seems much more probable that, except as a pretext, riverain affairs had nothing to do with the vali’s proceedings, and that the real motive for them is rather to be sought in the fact, suggested by His Majesty’s consul, Bussorah, some weeks before the present difficulty arose, that the Turkish authorities “ would not be sorry for an excuse to cause trouble to Persia weak and disorganised as she is”; a view to which the concluding sentence of telegram No. 71 from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constan tinople to the Foreign Office affords some corroboration. The position is not difficult to understand. The Turks have been able to encroach successfully on Persian territory on the northern portion of the frontier. At the southern end they have been powerless to do anything of the sort; firstly, because the Sheikh of Mohammerah can manage the Arabs in his own territory, and, secondly, because as an Arab he has strong influence also with the Turkish Arabs living near the frontier, from whom the Turks would consequently get little sympathy or assistance. Thus, from one side of the border we see that the power of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and his ability to look after himself constitutes the only bulwark on which Persia can rely to preserve her from Turkish encroachment on her south-west frontier ; while from the other side we find that he (with the Sheikh of Koweit indirectly) is the only obstacle to the furtherance of Turkish designs or national policy in the same region. The Porte has thus a patent motive for seeking to attenuate the sheikh’s power and detach his Arab adherents from him, and the simplest means of effecting that object is for them to make things unpleasant for the Arab tribesmen living near the frontier and endeavour to show them, now that they (the Turks) have some force at their command that the sheikh can no longer hold them in their difficulties, as of old. I he Porte ^ could hardly have selected a better opportunity for giving practical expression to this policy than the present occasion. Nazim Pasha had just arrived at Bagdad with large powers and a flourish of trumpets. At Bussorah they had recently replaced an Arab governor by an assertive “ Young Turk.” Their gun-boat “ Marmaris ” was in working trim. In the other camp the juncture found Sheikh Khazal in bad odour with a Cabinet at Tehran dominated by a Bakhtiari chief also anxious both for personal and tribal reasons to harm the sheikh and reduce his power. It was even suggested, you will remember, that the Persian Government or Medjliss had been previously approached and squared before the attack on the sheikh’s village took place. Lastly, the instrument selected by the vali was an excellent one for the purpose, owing to bis personal importance as a tribal leader and to his close relations with Sheikh Khazal. The vali must have known very well that he could not expect such a man to submit to arrest by a handful of gendarmes ; just as he knew well enough that it was not possible for the sbeikh to hand over his own tribal elder and brother-in-law to the Bussorah police. This mere fact no doubt supplied the necessary pretext for the use of the “ Marmaris.” The vali’s own behaviour since the incident is quite in harmony with the above theory. He was cordially welcomed by Nazim Pasha at Bagdad, and so far from proving amenable to any influence or persuasion applied by Mr. Crow in order to induce him to express regret to the sheikh he almost indignantly rejected his overtures and refused to entertain at all the question of personal amends on the ground that he had only acted under instructions and there had been nothing personal in the matter. But whether the Zain incident was a personal vagary of the vali’s or a premeditated plan emanating from the Porte, the fact remains, I submit, that it is our interest and our policy to maintain the Sheikh of Mohammerah in his position as a powerful Arab ruler at the head of the Gulf. So sure as we do not, our own position will suffer with [2824 l —2] C' his, and damage to his influence and well-being will react upon the prosperity of our commercial stake in his territory. I cannot see, therefore, that we have any object to serve in encouraging assertion of “ national rights ” on the part of the Turks, and I venture to hope that, after considering the Bussorah and Mohammerah reports regarding the recent incident, His ^ Maiesty’s Government will feel able to enunciate some common lines of policy for the guidance of our consuls at Bussorah and Mohammerah, by the joint pursuit of which they will be able to keep the Turkish authorities and the sheikh within constitutional bounds, and by doing so will jointly safeguard our position and great interests at the head of the Gulf. _ . , ? n ^ ^ , 4 Since writing the above paragraphs, I have received a copy ot Consul Crows despatch No. 35 of the 9th June, 1910, to His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah, and forward a copy thereof for your information.^ With reference to the postcript appended to the enclosure, I also enclose with it a copy of Lieutenant Wilson’s letter on which Mr. Crow’s quotation of him is based.

I HAVE the honour to state that, in compliance with your telegrams Nos. 467, dated the 8th May, 1910, and 549 of the 25th May, 1910, 1 have gone into the question of the Turkish complaints and allegations against the Sheikh of Mohammerah with the latter, and now record below, for your information, his replies to the various allegations and complaints made against him by the Yali of Bussorah, together with a translation of his letter in reply to the latter. I also submit a precis showing the progress of the negotiations between the sheikh and the vali, and the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s consul, Bussorah, and myself at each stage. I have also included his replies to various allegations set forth by Mr. Crow, which, though not coming officially from the Turks, may be presumed to show the attitude of the latter towards the sheikh. 1 would invite reference to my despatch No. 441/37 of the 7th May, 1910, to His Majesty s Legation, Tehran, on the subject of the dispute between the vali and the sheikh. 2. I have also added, where it seemed necessary, my own comments and those of Mr. McDouall, as recorded in the archives of the consulate. The Turkish allegation is shown in every case in the margin,* with an indication of the precise document in which it was contained. 3. j*The sheikh replies that it was never alleged, as far as he knows, that any servant of his agent was implicated, and the vali never suggested such a thing to him. No more has been heard of this accusation. The vali, about the 15th April, showed him a list of seven persons wanted in connection with the Minawi incident. The sheikh promised to arrest them if they were in his territories. He at once sent agents in all directions, and in four days’ time heard that three of them were in the Mohammerah district. He induced them by stratagem to come to Failieh, and imprisoned them. Troubles with the vali then ensued, totally unexpectedly ; and naturally, particularly as the sheikh was away, the handing over of these persons was delayed. A fourth was subsequently obtained. They were handed over on the 31st May. They were all Arabs from Bussorah, and unconnected with Mohammerah. 4. JThe sheikh replies that the vali wrote to him on this subject and that he had promised to do his best, though no proof was offered that the murderer was in his lands. He has had search made everywhere, with no result. The Bussorah police in the first place made no serious effort to catch the man, and the story that he has fled to Mohammerah was, he says, probably invented by them to explain their own remissness. Chilmeran was an old friend of the sheikh and of his house, and he looked on him as an adherent; were even Persia and Turkey at war, the sheikh says he would hand over his murderer to the Turks. The latter have not given him the slightest indication of their reasons for saying that he has fled to Mohammerah, and, in any case, they only suggested it some time after the murder. 5. §The sheikh says this is untrue; he asks who “ reports ” them to be in Mohammerah 1 If the Turks want individuals from him, they have only to name them, specify their offence, and satisfy him that the accused are Turkish subjects. He has frequently handed over even Persian subjects in a friendly way. Let' the Turks produce a list, and give their reasons for making such sweeping statements. He absolutely denies the receipt of any list such as that referred to in Mr. Crow’s letter No. 46 of the 27th April to me, and Mr. Crow himself now says he has no confirmation whatever of the statement that the list was sent. This, the sheikh says, is simply a repetition of the reply the police in Bussorah made to every succeeding vali when taken to task for their remissness, thus creating bad blood between Mohammerah and Bussorah authorities. * * * § * Marginal notes are printed as footnotes against paragraphs to which they refer. f Robbers attacked a house at Minawi, near Bussorah, in March 1910; one of the robbers said to be servant of sheikh’s agents; reported that he had fled to Mohammerah, and that sheikh refused to give him up. (Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 22, dated April 22, 1910.) f Chelmeran, Turkish land-owner, killed on his lands by his own labourers close to Bussorah. Murderers said to have fled to Mohammerah, and not to have been given up. (Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 22 dated April 22, 1910.) § Many criminals, fugitives from justice, are reported to be in Mohammerah, and when sheikh is asked to hand them over he refuses to do so. (Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 22, dated April 22, 1910.)8 6. * * * § The sheikh’s position in this case is best shown by the following extract from Mr. McDouall’s despatch JNo. 55 of the 24th April, 1909 :— “As to the Maghil case, I do not agree with Mr. Crow’s opinion that the sheikh did not assist. My opinion was that he did, but it is always very difficult to arrest men of the marsh Arabs, who are protected by their friends; as to the two men, there was reason to suspect that they were wanted by the Turks for other reasons.” Mr. McDouall’s eighteen years’ experience of Mohammerah entitles him to speak on the subject with authority (see also Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 25 of the 7th May, 1910). When the alleged murderer was brought to Bussorah he was allowed to escape a few days later. The Turks’ record in the Maghil case is so bad that they cannot throw stones at the sheikh, and the above complaint is, as a matter of fact, that of Mr. Crow, not of the vali. 7. |The sheikh replies that the “ trespassers ” whom Mishri tried to have removed in the “ usual way ” were subjects of his own, and belonged to the Persian tribe of Haji Faisal. Mishri was trying to cheat the cultivators referred to out of their legal rights. The sheikh did his best for some time before the matter came to a head to settle things amicably between Mishri and the cultivators, but without success. Mishri then proposed to replace them with other Arabs, of the tribe of Mohammed Chanan, but the latter tribal chief refused to let any men of his tribe replace Haji Faisal’s men, as this would give rise to a blood-feud, or at least to much bitterness. Mishri was very angry at this, and made a big case of it. He told lies to the vali and to the police, and as far as the sheikh can make out the story of his or of his agent’s life being threatened by Mohammed Chanan is based solely on Mishri’s word or that of the police Mohammed Chanan did not do so, nor any responsible person. 8. JThe sheikh replies that Mohammed Chanan is a Persian subject, that he wrote as much to the vali at the time. The Tabur Agassi (police sergeant) went to Zain to arrest Mohammed Chanan, but alleged no specific offence, except that he had been annoying Mishri, who is a tyrannical and grasping man. Tabur Agassi and Mohammed Chanan both came in the same “bellum” to visit the sheikh at Failieh and to discuss what should be done over a friendly cup of tea. Tabur Agassi made no complaint of any kind whatever as to threats, but simply said that Mohammed Chanan said he was a Persian—would the sheikh w r rite to this effect to the vali ? Sheikh at once wrote a friendly and polite note to the vali, saying that the Tabur Agassi had seen him on the subject of Mohammed Chanan, that the latter was a Persian subject, but that nevertheless the sheikh would bring him up to Bussorah in two days’ time to discuss the matters at issue and arrange a settlement. He added that he would be going up the Karun shortly, and would take the opportunity to “ ask permission to take his departure,” a particularly differential and courteous phrase. He was, he says, under the impression when he wrote the letter that the vali was on the best of terms with him. He went up to Bussorah two days later and found to his surprise that the vali now refused to receive him at all unless Mohammed Chanan was forthwith handed over to the police. The sheikh pointed out in vain that he was accused of no specific offence, that he was a Persian, and that the case of Mishri was eminently one for amicable settlement—the vali was obdurate. He had no alternative but to return to Mohammerah with Mohammed Chanan, who, it should be added, is his brother-in-law, and head of the most important of the tribes round Mohammerah. 9. §The sheikh replies that more than half of the tribes from Gurnah to Fao happen to be of the sheikh’s tribes, and are Persian subjects; the sheikh in consequence has great influence, and since mukhtars are always chosen, by the Turks, from the * Sheikh refused or prevaricated over surrender of persons concerned in Mr. Glanville’s murder m 1906 (Maghil case). (Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 17 of March 10, 1909, and No. 22 of April 22, 1910.) f Mishri, a Turkish land-owner, applied to the Turkish authorities in the usual way to remove certain cultivators from his lands at Dawasir, but without success, and trespassers were supported by Mohammed Chanan, an adherent of the sheikh. (Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 22 of April 22, 1910.) N.B.—This is a complaint against Mohammed Chanan, not against the sheikh. J Reference above complaint, the Turkish police were informed when they tried to arrest Mohammed Chanan that he and all his people belonged to sheikh, and could not come to Bussorah (to be imprisoned), and if arrest was insisted on Mishri’s agent would be killed like Chelmeran. (Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 22 of April 22, 1910.) § Yali said he distrusted the sheikh. His influence as a land-owner and tribal sheikh was great, and he thought must of the mukhtars from Gurnah to Fao were in his pay, or pledged to his interests. (Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 22, dated April 23, 1910.)headmen of the locality, it is not surprising if they are in a way pledged to the sheikh’s interests. But he points out there is no reason to suppose that the mukhtars are in any way hostile to the Turks’ influence, and, in support of this and of his own consistently peaceful policy, he points out that the Arab tribes from Gurnah to Fao are the only ones who never give any trouble to the Turks; they pay their taxes regularly, and are probably as law abiding a community in their stage of civilisation as can be found anywhere. The limit of the sheikh’s influence, Gurnah, is also that of the Turks’ authority. Beyond the point at which the sheikh’s influence ends the Turkish authorities have failed to collect revenue for the last three years, and are still engaged in ineffective punitive operations. 10. ''■■The sheikh’s reply shows that he himself has always attributed the river troubles to the same cause as Mr. Crow did in his despatch No. 17 of the 10th March, 1909, of which the following is an extract:— “ As long as action is confined to mere perfunctory police enquiries, and reference is made to a so-called criminal court, where no justice is obtainable, while local authorities are allowed to throw dust in our eyes by arresting offenders and sentencing them to expiate the offences of guilty defaulters, the lawless condition of Bussorah will not improve.” 11. In this connection it may not be out of place to refer also to Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 8 of the 30th January, 1907, to Sir N. O’Conor, reporting a piracy from a British Indian sailing-vessel at Abul Khasib. He states that he asked the authorities to capture the pirates and recover the stolen property. The Turkish official at Abul Khasib failed to report the outrage, and no energetic measures were taken until four telegrams from the Grand Vizier, as well as one from the Sultan’s private secretary, had been received. Even then the men arrested were not the real culprits, but men who had incurred the enmity of the police by complaining of their misdoings to Constantinople. 12. Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 36 of the 8th May, 1907, to Sir N. O’Conor is also of interest in this connection as showing that at that time river troubles were due to Turkish bad faith with the Arab tribes, and troubles in Bussorah to the inefficiency of the administration. In the latter regard I may quote the following :— “ There is no improvement in public security Mr. Hickey, the British subject who was attacked and robbed by an armed force of brigands .... on the 3rd May narrowly escaped being stabbed The police were not, and never are, on the spot ; the gendarmes charged with patrolling the streets are absent from their posts, and view these incidents from a safe distance, being much too callous to interfere, or, what is still more likely, in league with the robbers themselves ! House after house is looted with impunity, while the Turks waste valuable time in fruitless judicial enquiries and in the pursuit of robbers, who seem well known, but who invariably elude the mock vigilance of the executive officers.” 13. Again, in 1908. during Mr. Geary’s tenure of the office of consul in Bussorah, several piracies occurred in the Shatt-el-Arab, which formed the subject of complaint by Mr. Geary to the then vali. In one case only was it suggested that the sheikh’s Arabs were responsible, and on enquiry at Mohammerah it turned out that, though the boatload of pirates pushed off from and returned to the Persian shore, it was believed that they did this to hide their identity, as Arabs on the Turkish side were reported a few days later to be dividing the spoil. No action was taken by the Turks, and the writer was informed by Mr. Geary himself that the nerveless and corrupt administration of the Bussorah vilayet was in his opinion responsible for the disturbances. 14. The sheikh may be excused for doubting that the situation in 1910 is radically different from that described above by Mr. Crow. He adds that a still commoner method of the police, and likely to be popular in proportion to the efficiency of the courts of justice, is to assert that the criminal has fled to Persian soil. Mr. Crow’s statement in his letter to me of the 27th April, that he has repeatedly in previous years drawn the attention of His Majesty’s Government to the attitude of the sheikh in regard to river troubles generally, and to disturbances in Bussorah in particular, is not supported by the archives of this consulate. Beyond the Maghil case * Vali attributed all the river troubles from Fao to Bussorah to sheikh’s influence and was putting in his own men as muktars in place of sheikh’s men (vide supra). [2824 /—2] D(vide paragraph 6) and the troubles with Moharrem Bey, reported in Mr. Crow’s despatch No 17 of the 10th iMarch, 1909, to Constantinople, Mr. Crow seems to have made no complaints against the sheikh, and in the latter case he apparently did not think the matter of sufficient importance to warrant his sending a copy of his despatch on the subiect to His Majesty’s consul, Mohammerah. _ The first intimation received by the latter was a copy of the despatch in question received from the resident at Bushire ' ’ (who had himself received it from the resident at Bagdad), together with a request for an expression of view on the subject. _ . , 15. * This is the crux of the accusation against Mohammed Chanan which led to the attack on Zain, and was the forts et origo mail, though it is wholly denied by the sheikh. I have made most careful enquiry from several sources, and am unable to obtain any confirmation of the vah s statements. _ . , _ As regards attacking farms, not only can I obtain no corroboration, but also it is inherently^mprobable that he would do such a thing, since practically all the farms are in the hands of his own fellow-tribesmen. The sheikh’s version is that Mohammed Chanan would not let his men replace those whom Mishri wanted to turn out, and I believe this to be correct. Mr. Crow tells me he has no information in corroboration or otherwise of the vali’s statements on this subject. lhat he committed aggression in Turkish lands is, as far as I can ascertain, untrue. What kind of aggression ? That he threatened to kill the owners is, as has been said above, an accusation simply based on hearsay In this connection the sheikh draws attention to the fact that it was the murder of Mishri’s agent which was first said to have been threatened by Mohammed Chanan. Later the accusation was that it was Mishri himself whose life was said to have been threatened. Mohammed Chanan was not present at Dawasir at the time, and denies that he ever said such a thing. It is, of course, conceivable that one of his irresponsible followers may have done so. The last accusation that Mohammed collected an armed force to oppose the gendarmes of the State is unsubstantiated by any evidence that I can obtain, and Mr. Crow tells me that beyond the vali’s statement he has heard nothing of it. The sheikh says, and it is impossible to doubt him in this circumstantial particular, that the Tabur Agassi and Mohammed Chanan came to his place in the same boat^ and discussed the question in quite an amicable way, no complaints being made on either It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the sheikh is fully wananted in saying that there was nothing against Mohammed Cnanan that could not ha\e been settled by half-an-hour’s conversation with the vali as he tried to arrange; had the van, instead of discourteously refusing to see the sheikh at all on the subject, discussed the question with him, and heard the other side, things would undoubtedly have turned out verv differently. The sheikh believes that Mishri has a spite against Mohammed Chanan because the latter would not let his men act, in the English working-man s parlance, as “ blacklegs,” and that he induced the vali to believe that Turkish rule was being flouted by Chanan. , 16. The principal chronic accusation made against the sheikh by the Turks is that he exercises illegitimate influence in Turkey. The influence of the sheikh in Turkish territory is due to the fact that he is the titular head of more than ^ half of the Arabs occupying the Turkish bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, and expects, and, in a large measure, received implicit obedience from them. He is a large landowner, with more extensive property on the Turkish side of the river than is possessed by any Turkish . su ‘ 3 J e ^- He owns valuable house property in Bussorah, and though it has been considerably diminished in value in the last few months by the vali’s expropriation schemes in connec tion with new roads, the sheikh has not allowed the question to interfere with is friendly relations with the vali (vide Mr. Crow s despatch No. 14 of the 9th March, 191 ), asking'only to be treated as well as British subjects were being treated. Had he adopted a hostile attitude to the vali on this point he would have secured the support of the influential families in Bussorah, and might have embarrassed the vali very seriously. Again, when the news of the attack of the vali on the sheikh’s properties was spread abroad, the latter received numerous voluntary offers of active assistance an co-operation from almost every important Turkish Arab chief from Amara to ao. Had he accepted them, and commenced active reprisals against the Turks, he wou , * Mohammed Chanan opposed a detachment sent after him for attacking several farms. ( ^ ^ to Persian consul-general No. 18.) Mohammed Chanan committed aggression on Turkish lands, tnr ^ to kill the owners, collected an armed force to oppose the gendarmes of the State, and supporten r (Acting vali’s letter of May 10.)force to op it I can olt ISfllUyWE: could not k arrange :he subject, fc loubtedlyta* ie against iglish wortf thatTurb^ 11 I have no doubt, have gravely embarrassed the Turkish Government in Mesopotamia and secured his object—the dismissal of the vali. Realisation of this fact is not, however, in my humble opinion, inconsistent, as Mr. Marling suggests in his telegram No. 31 dated the 31st May, with a recognition W the sheikh that the rising naval power of the Turks would overwhelm him in the ^id, unless he could count on the support of His Majesty’s Government. 17. The other important general accusation against the sheikh is that he has, in the past, connived at or instigated the perpetration of outrages in Turkish territory. The sheikh does not entirely deny this charge, but he admits it only in connection with the period (1909) when Moharrem Bey was Vali of Bussorah and only in regard to two or three occasions. He justifies himself by pointing out that Moharrem Bey was a violent and ill-tempered man, with whom personal dealings were an impossibility, The Persian Government was then, as now, hopelessly disorganised and unable to make any effective representations at Constantinople ; the Persian consul-general was equally unable to say anything to the Vali of Bussorah, and was in any case incompetent. The vali committed with impunity acts of grave injustice against the shiekh and against his subjects living in Turkish territory. Protests proved of no avail and the petitions which the people of Bussorah sent to Constantinople asking for the removal of the vali were unanswered. Deprived of all diplomatic weapons, unable, by reason of Moharrem Bey’s personality, to discuss things with him in a friendly spirit, the sheikh had recourse to the only means at his command to secure what was, in his eyes, the only remedy—the removal of the vali. He was successful, as the vali was removed shortly afterwards, and the sheikh’s action had the support of the people of Bussorah to whom Moharrem Bey had been equally obnoxious. 18. The sheikh, in winding up the conversation, emphasised the fact that his specific grievances against the Turks were numerous and likely to be more serious in the future than at present. The Turkish officials were, he said, pursuing a policy of pin-pricks in regard to him and his tribe, and causing great annoyance to the latter. Extortion, arbitrary action by Turkish officials against Arabs on the ex parte statements of avaricious Turkish landlords were now every day incidents and the constant subject of complaints to him. The present vali seemed, he said, to be bent on putting all sorts of impracticable laws into force amongst Arabs, upsetting the status quo and the tranquillity of the country side, not apparently in order to remedy the state of affairs, but solely in order to cause trouble amongst peaceable Arabs, whilst at the same time he took no serious steps to bring to book those tribes such as the Muntafik, who openly defied his authority. I have, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON, Lieutenant, I.A. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. rfve Sheikh of Mohammerah to the Acting Vali of Bussorah. (After compliments.) Mohammerah, May 16, 1910. YOUR letter of the 3rd Rabi-u-Sani, No. 133, which your agent, Saad Bey, sent me, reached me on the Karun, and the contents have been noted. Regarding the acts which you did at Kut-i-Zain, on account of the threatening by Mohammed Chanan, of the Tabur Agasse, and the gendarmes, whom you had sent to see him, I am much surprised at your account of the matter. On this account, that when the Tabur Agassi came with Mohammed Chanan to Failieh to see me, he made no complaint and made no mention of such acts. As we are united and friends, I do not want to say more on this subject. Were I to do so, I am sure that I should be vindicated, and your sense of justice would corroborate me. What happened at Kut-i-Zain is not hidden from you. Moreover, Mohammed Chanan, as is well known, is a chief of the Muhaisin tribe and a Persian subject, and he was my agent in Zain for the care of my lands there. In accordance with your agent’s letter, I have removed him and will replace him by another person. Regarding those who attacked and killed Chelmeran, from the first day that I heard the news I gave the necessary orders in my own districts to search for and capture the murderers, but they have not up to date been found and do not belong to j l —__12 the people of this district. If a single one of them comes into my district, be will be seized and handed over. Regarding the Minawi incident. When you mentioned the matter to me 1 o- a the necessary orders, and one day before my departure to the Karun [ captured thr of them. As I was on the point of leaving I could not inform the vilayet, and on m return in the same way I captured one more of them and informed the ao-ent of tdft vilayet that he might send an agent to take them over. A reply was received, an agent sent, and the men handed over. With regard to what you wrote about handing over fugitive criminals, on this matter a treaty exists between Turkey and Persia, and I am a Persian subject and hereditary warden of the frontier, and your Excellency is no doubt aware of the treaty. Therefore I and your Excellency cannot give undertakings contrary to the treaty but in view of the friendly relations that exist between us in the past and in the future in all matters relating to the prevention of trouble in no way has any fault been found nor will be in the future. No evil acts have hitherto been committed by my tribes in Turkish territory; as far as possible I will make extreme efforts for the preservation of peace and security there, and to that end I consider myself responsible. And whenever you desire to conclude a personal agreement between us, relating to the above treatv between the two Governments, I am at your service. (L.S.) KHAZ’AL-BIN-JABIR. Dated 25th Jamadi-ul-Awwal, 1328. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Memorandum by Acting Consul Wilson. THE following memorandum is intended to supplement the documentary narrative of the troubles which have recently arisen between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Vali of Bussorah, and to explain briefly the action of the writer vis-a-vis the Sheikh of Mohammerah and His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah. The first intimation that any trouble was likely was conveyed to me on the 24th April by a copy of Mr. Crow’s despatch No 22 of the 23rd April, 1910, to His Majesty s Embassy, detailing an interview which he had had with the vali, in which the latter, after^ making a series of complaints against the sheikh, announced his intention of sending the gun-boat “ Marmaris ” to Zain to demonstrate, and, if necessary, punish Mohammed Chanan and his retainers. The vali further said that he intended to take strong action. _ Remarking from this despatch that Mr. Crow had made no protest to the vali against his proposals, and had not considered the matter of sufficient immediate importance to justify a telegraphic report to Constantinople, I hurried to Bussorah forthwith (24th April) to attempt to induce Mr. Crow to take action to dissuade the vali from carrying out his plans. It was, however, too late, as the.vali had already sent the Marmaris, and in any case Mr. Crow seemed disinclined to take action, and suggested that the vali was not in earnest. I, however, prevailed upon him to send a wire to Constantinople on the subject. On my return to Mohammerah at mid-day on the 25th April, I found that the Marmaris had shelled and burnt Mohammed Chanan’s village an hour previously. I at once proceeded to the spot with a representative of the sheikh, ascertained precisely what had occurred, telegraphed the facts to the resident at Bushire, and returned the same evening to Bussorah to see Mr. Crow again and inform him of what had occurred. Previous to going to Bussorah, however, I visited the sheikhs principal men in Mohammerah and warned them to do nothing whatever, and to allow no reprisals pending orders from the sheikh who had proceeded to Ahwaz on the 21st instant. On arrival at Bussorah, 1 found that Mr. Crow had heard nothing of what had occur led at Zain, and he did not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situation that it created. ^ In reply to my letters of the 24th and 25th, he answered, on the 27th, that tne day of reckoning for the sheikh had come, and that though the action of the l inks might be arbitrary, he would press for them to be supplied with the proper means to carry it through.He, however, modified his attitude to some extent, as, when he attended a reception by the vali held on the “ Marmaris,” he listened coldly to the vali’s triumphant remarks on the subject of the gun-boat’s action, and fas he informed me) told the vali that his impetuous action was ill-calculated to secure the results ostensibly desired, and ^ that he would have done well to consult His Majesty’s consul before taking action. The vali shortly afterwards left for Bagdad, where he was to meet Nazim Pasha, under whose general control he now is. He received an exceptionally cordial and distinguished reception. The sheikh meanwhile, at A.hwaz, telegraphed for advice to me as to whether he should return to Mohammerah at once or not. I replied that he should not return at present as his precipitate arrival on the scene would certainly create a lively anticipation of reprisals, the expectation of which might induce the vali to pursue his hostile policy still further. My fears were confirmed by the vali’s letters about this time (the ^6th April) to the Persian consul-general at Bussorah, in which he threatened to attack Mohammerah. As the sheikh is guaranteed by ns against unprovoked attack by sea, he at once, on learning of this letter, telegraphed to Mirza Hamza to beg me to telegraph to Bpshire asking that we would support him in accordance with our promises by sending a gun-boat to Mohammerah to protect him from attack by sea, and to show the Turks that we could not tolerate any such action. This suggestion was negatived by His Majesty’s charge d’affaires, Tehran, and luckily the vali did not carry out his threats. The sheikh feels acutely our refusal to send a gun-boat in spite of the fact that an attack on Mohammerah was officially threatened by the vali unless Mohammed Ohanan was surrendered. The refusal has detracted from the value in his eyes of our assurances, since on the only occasion when we have been asked to render him prompt support we have withheld it for fear of giving umbrage to the Turks. On the 5th May, Haji Rais, the sheikh’s right-hand man, who had been sent down by the sheikh with instructions to consult me as to the advisability of proceeding to Bussorah to interview the vali, arrived at Nasiri. With my concurrence he went on to Bussorah, though in a state of considerable trepidation for his personal safety. The vali had by this time left for Bagdad, and Haji Rais accordingly visited the acting vali and by his intermediation effected a temporary settlement with the vah, the acting vah giving him a letter to the sheikh, offering to resume amicable relations on certain conditions. The letter contained much that was objectionable to the sheikh, threats and unjustified allegations being freely intermingled with polite phrases. But Haji Rais, in the weak position which he was, having clearly understood from Mr. Crow that His Majesty’s consul had no authority to press the vali to descend from the position which he had taken up, felt bound to accept it as assuring a temporary cessation of hostilities. He was, moreover, plainly informed (1m told me) by Mr. Crow that his orders “ to promote an amicable settlement did not in his opinion justify any attempt to put active pressure on the vali. I agreed with Haji Rais that, this being the case, the settlement was the best ad interim arrangement procurable pending a decision by His Majesty’s Govern ment on the general question, and it was represented to and regarded by the sheikh in this light. B urther negotiations were then delayed for a fortnight pending the return of the sheikh from Ahwaz, where he was occupied in reconciling the Arab tribes near Dizful to each other, with a view to preventing disturbances there. On the 24th May he returned from Ahwaz, and I at once communicated to him Foreign Office telegram No. 137 (received on the 14th May), stating that serious representations had been made in Constantinople, and that a gun-boat would be held in readiness in case it should be required for the protection of Mohammerah territory. This announcement did a good deal to improve the sheikh’s state of mind, and gave him reason to hope that the eventual settlement provided would have adequate regard for liis rights and prestige as well as for those of Turkey. The sheikh consulted me as to the tenor of the reply which he should send to the vali in answer to the acting vali’s letter of the 11th May. I outlined a reply which seemed to be suitable, and he concurred with me unreservedly. I then submitted the outlines of the proposed reply for the approval of the resident. I also sent a copy to Mr. Cio^vv, who, in leply, informed me that, with a few minor alterations, he considered the reply unobjectionable. In the meanwhile I received orders to proceed to Bussorah to confer with Mr. Crow with a view to a settlement on the lines of Foreign Office telegram No. 165 (leceived lehian, the 26th May), 'i.e., ‘ sheikh to promise to give up Turkish criminals [2824 1—2] E14 and not- foment disturbances. Vali to express regret for injury to sheikh’s family and assure him that if he keeps his promises his tribes and property will not be molested” The sheikh was quite ready to do his share on these lines, though he does not admit that he has sheltered Turkish criminals nor habitually fomented disturbances in the past. The vali, however, was at some pains to make it perfectly clear that he would not accept Mr. Crow’s intervention in the matter, and that he would not apologise in any way. This being the case, and the vali being on his way back to Bussorah, the sheikh saw : at once that to delay his reply until the question of vali offering expression of regret had been disposed of would be injudicious. Pending receipt of the approval of His Majesty’s Government to his proposed reply to the vali, he asked the Turks to send men to take over four criminals for whom they had applied. These men reached Bussorah as intended by the sheikh, two days before the arrival of the vali, thus avoiding any slight to the acting vali, who had taken part in the preliminary negotiations for their surrender. On the 2nd June, two days after the return of the vali, I was informed by Colonel Cox, in his telegram of the 30th May, to the effect that the sheikh’s proposed reply was approved, and I at once told the sheikh to send it off. On the 4th June he accordingly sent Haji R-ais, his right-hand man, to Bussorah with the reply (a copy of which is appended to my letter forwarded herewith). The vali received Haji Rais politely, and seemed not dissatisfied with the sheikh’s reply, to which he sent a polite answer. His protestations of friendship and his expression of hope that the sheikh would let “ bygones be bygones ” were unfortunately considerably discounted by several occurrences which took place whilst Haji Rais was in Bussorah as the guest of the vali. In the first place, a law suit in which one Mustafa, a servant of Mirza Hamza, the sheikh’s Bussorah agent, was concerned, was revived and warrants issued for the man’s arrest, regardless of the fact that during the negotiations between Haji Rais and the acting vali, the latter had obtained the withdrawal of the case and had promised that no more should be heard of it. Haji Rais was informed by the vali, in reply to his protest, that the latter knew nothing of the acting vali’s action in the matter, and in any case could^ not intervene in judicial questions. Haji Rais, however, understands that the vali himself requested that the case should be reopened. Secondly, for the third time since the troubles between the sheikh and the vali began, the sheikh’s houses on the Ashar creek were partly pulled down, in spite of the fact that they did not project into the roadway, and that their frontage had been some time back formally approved by the vali. When representations were made to the vali on this subject, he said on each occasion that it was a mistake on the part of a subordinate official, and that he would issue orders to prevent its recurrence. But it is remarkable that such mistakes should not have been made in the case of other persons’ houses. Haji Rais further tells me that he has definite information that the vali instigated these acts. Lastly, whilst Haji Rais was in Bussorah an official of the Courts of Justice with a band of soldiers raided the empty house of the sheikh’s Bussorah agent, and forcibly distrained his carriages and some other possessions, on the ground that a summons for debt bad been issued against him by Government for payment of £ T. 300, but had been disregarded. The vali denied all knowledge of the matter and ordered the return of the goods distrained. But Abdul Wahab-al-Kartass has told Haji Rais that the case was started by the vali himself in revenge for Mirza Hamza’s attitude in regard to the sheikh s house property in Bussorah, and that the vali personally interested himself in obtaining a judgment against Mirza Hamza ; the latter states, however, that no summons ever reached him. I he cumulative effect of these incidents has been to convince the sheikh that the present yali is hopelessly unreliable, if not actually treacherous, and that as long as he remains in Bussorah there will be no guarantee of a recurrence of troubles such as have occurred recently, unless the Turkish authorities both in Bussorah and Constantinople are given plain intimation that His Majesty’s Government are supporting him and will not tolerate aggression on Mohammerah territory. Mr. Crow has given Haji Rais plainly to understand that he is unable to intervene m Bussorah affairs, where the vali is acting ostensibly in conformity with judicial administrative rules, and the vali has not less plainly informed Mr. Crow that he will not tolerate his intervention in Mohammerah and Koweit affairs. It is important that it should be fully understood that the sheikh has everything to lose and nothing to gain by gratuitously opposing the Vali of Bussorah and no onerealises this better than he does. The value of the personal property which he inherited from his father on the Turkish bank of the river is probably not less than 250,000L, and it is not reasonable to suppose that as long as the vali treats him with tolerable consideration he will court difficulties in connection with his property, or ^yOpardise the peace and prosperity of his tribal tenants by lightly incurring the hostility of the Bussorah authorities. In the case of the vali the position is quite different. He may have an easier task when he is on good terms with the sheikh, but he has the support of his Govern ment when he is not. He is here to-day and gone to-morrow, and has no personal stake or local interest, and for the rest is imbued with the chronic Turkish idea that the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit are the chief obstacles to the realisation of Turkish ambition to reduce the Arab population of Turkish Arabia to the condition of serfs destitute of any hereditary right to the land which they occupy. I should add finally that I showed His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah the draft of the letter to which this prbcis is appended, and asked him whether he had any information which would tend to refute or throw doubt upon the genuineness of the sheikh’s replies to various allegations made by the Turks. He replied that he was not now, and never had been in a position to sift the truth of the allegations made by the Turks ; that the latter were invariably untruthful, and that, situated as he was in Bussorah, he had no opportunities for applying an independent test to the accounts given him by the Turks of the recent troubles or of others. He added that should His Majesty’s Embassy ask him to submit evidence in support of the vali’s allegations or of his own statements, he would suggest that the Turkish Government were in a better position than he to furnish such controversial material. I should add that Mr. Crow’s dragoman is a Turk, and obtains his information from Turkish sources, and that circumstances usually seem to preclude Mr. Crow from obtaining the views of Arabs on current issues, even if he desired to know them. A. T. WILSON, Lieutenant, I.A. Mohammerah, June 4, 1910. Enclosure 7 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Consul Crow. My dear Crow, Mohammerah, June 8, 1910. YOUBS of the 8th. I have handed over two halters to Lloyd, Scott, and Co. (Limited), to be sent up to you by first opportunity. 1 will let you know what the cost is later. I enclose a copy of the letter of the vaii to the sheikh. The sheikh now says that he cares little for apologies, as the vali is so impetuous that to force him to give them from Constantinople would only make things worse. We have tried once and failed, and, in his view, to try to work it from the Porte, even if successful, would do more harm than good. But he is most anxious that we should insist, both in Bussorah and in Constan tinople, on our right to intervene in Mohammerah affairs being recognised fully by the vali. That, he says, will be the best guarantee against trouble in the future. I quite agree with him, and shall do my best in Bushire to get the resident to press this point of view on His Majesty’s Government. He tells me that the vali has publicly announced that he will not tolerate the interference of His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah in any affairs either at Koweit or Mohammerah. He says that the vali is not only impetuous but treacherous, as is his conduct in relation to Sheikh Khazal’s house, which has been three times quite needlessly pulled down after having been repaired. Haji Rais says he had definite proof when in Bussorah that the vali knew all about it. Regarding the seizure of Mirza Hamza’s property in Bussorah by order of the court, of which the vali disclaimed all knowledge to Haji Rais, it now appears that the claim for 300L was commenced by the vali against Mirza Hamza in revenge for his attitude on the house question, and that the vali has secretly instigated the proceedings all along. This is our side of the question. I think the vali is altogether unstable, and that nothing but trouble will arise as long as he remains in Bussorah. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON.[This Document' is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Governnie CONFIDENTIAL. [24858] PERSIA. S ACTION 1. [July 11.] Sir G.

GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consid Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 35.) Sir, Bussorah, June 9, 1910. WITH reference to my telegram No. 37 of the 9th instant, I have the honour to transmit a translation of the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s reply, which Haji Reiss handed to the vali on Sunday morning, the 5th June. Haji Reiss visited me the same evening, and according to his account, the vali gave him a friendly reception, kept him to lunch and discussed the Zein business and general relations with Mohammerah unreservedly. Both parties gave their respective versions of the immediate events which led to the breach, and the vali remarked, inter alia, that local reports had been sent to Constantinople complaining that he left the administration of outlying districts too much in the hands of the Sheikh o f Mohammerah, and said he had been censured by Constantinople in consequence. He read and accepted the sheikh’s written reply to his letter without comment, saying merely that he had nothing against the sheikh personally, but he wanted his loyal assistance to catch Turkish criminals who escaped to Mohammerah, and professed himself willing to reciprocate if Persian criminals fled to Bussorah. He added he would not allow the police to take advantage of the friendly understanding between the sheikh and himself in order to make a scapegoat of Mohammerah whenever they failed to catch culprits, and said applications for surrender would only be made in well-authenticated cases after careful enquiry, and production ^ of satisfactory evidence of the parties’ guilt. He assured him friendly relations with the sheikh were now restored. Haji Reiss asked the vali to write a friendly private letter to the sheikh to that effect, and the vali undertook to do so. Haji Reiss also referred to the partial destruction of some of the sheikh’s new buildings on the Ashar creek, and the vali agreed to examine the ground in his presence on the following day, and see what was required. I called on Abdul Wahab Pasha-el-Kartass at Saraji, about 3 miles down river, on the 6th June, and discussed the affair with him. He is an intimate friend of Sheikh Khazal s, and is well aware of all that has lately occurred. He agreed to visit the sheikh at Mohammerah as soon as Haji Reiss had returned, and inform me how matters stood. Haji Reiss called again on me in the evening. He brought me a copy in Arabic of the sheikh’s reply, and showed me a sealed private letter which he had received from the vali for the sheikh, of which, however, he did not know the contents. He said he had come to an amicable understanding with the vali about the sheikh’s new houses, and had arranged to stop all work until the vilayet engineer had drawn up a plan of the proposed new' quarter to work upon. Haji Reiss then left for Mohammerah. I called on the 'vali on luesday morning the 7th June. I had not met him since his return from Bagdad on the 1st June. He w r as friendly and polite, but observed a frigid silence in regard to the Mohammerah question. When I broached the subject he expressed deep resentment at my interference, and could not believe that the British Government, which had helped Turkey so much in past years, was now going to turn against it on account of the little Sheikh of Mohammerah. He said he could [2824 /—l]2 not conceal the great surprise my letters had caused him, and that he was nre rl to meet any criticism of his acts, provided it came from the proper quarter naml his own department. He was astounded that I should have represented the Sh of Mohammerah as being interested in the affair of Kut-el-Zein, as that localitv 1 part of Turkey, and the brigands who w^ere harboured there were Turkish suh'ieet^ I He remarked that he had directed the acting vali to accept no interference from me 8 the matter, either official or private, as the question in no way concerned England 1 He then went on to tell me that before his appointment as vali he had been edit of the “ Tesvir Efkiar,” and was quite au courant not only of events in Persia but also of English foreign politics, and he proceeded to give me a lengthy and somewhat journalistic account of his views on these subjects. His arguments, however, as far as I could measure them, seemed as wide of the matter in hand as they were removed from the precincts of reason. I replied that I was sorry we were such an interfering people; unavoidably we had our finger in many pies, but this need not disturb the excellent relations which existed between ourselves, and I merely wanted to tell him what the Foreign Office said about this Mohammerah business. I said we were glad to hear he had effected a reconciliation with the sheikh, and were obliged to him for meeting us in the matter I had already communicated the views, not of myself, but of His Majesty’s Government on this subject to the acting vali. I had received many telegrams from the Foreign Office, our embassy at Constantinople, and the legation at Tehran, and all agreed on tlm necessity of arranging matters amicably between himself and the sheikh. His Majesty’s Government wished the affair dealt with locally, and I now desired, with his permission, to communicate the instructions I had received. As to the matters in dispute, his Excellency had communicated directly with the sheikh, letters had been exchanged, and friendly relations re-established. I had twice written privately to his Excellency regarding some^ expression of regret on his part to the sheikh for his personal family trouble. His Majesty's Government thought it would be well, in order to strengthen and confirm the good understanding now arrived at, “ if his Excellency would express in a friendly and private manner his regret, that is to say, his condolences lor the personal injury sustained by the sheikh, namely, the death of his wife and the discomfort caused to his^ mother, and would assure the sheikh that if he kept his promises his tribes and his property on Ottoman soil would not be molested.” I read this passage to him, and offered to give him my Turkish translation, but he said he preferred to have it verbally. I also carefully explained to him that His Majesty’s Government did not ask for mi apology for what had occurred, but simply an expression of regret for the sheikh’s private trouble, and I pointed out that, although w e u y realised the difficulties of the Turkish Government on the river, we were old nencs o t ie sheikh as with Turkey, and if we had not protected the sheikh in his ealmgs with the rersian Government, Mohammerah and Arabistan would have gone n°ir m C -?r S 01 p^ a ? 0 \ . ^ e were deeply interested in Arabistan, where we had about la a mi ion o capital invested^ and we wanted no quarrels between the Governors of ljussorah and Mohammerah. We were prepared to use our influence with the sheikh to keep him from fomenting disturbances on the Turkish side, but if he did not keep Ins promises we should certainly not protect him. The vali answered that he had practically fulfilled the second part of our request, as e a written privately to the sheikh on the preceding day and assured him of his nen s i 1 ? an d good-will and protection of his affairs in Turkey, and assurances to the same eflect were given in the last paragraph of ‘his previous letter (see Enclosure 3 in my espa e o. -6 of the 14th May to the embassy), but he firmly, though politely, 0 wri te anything to the sheikh in the form of condolence or regret for the sheikh s personal concerns, with which, he said, he had nothing to do. He declared himself convinced that his action at Zein was justified and fully vindicated by past mstoiy on the river, and as the action was undertaken on behalf of his Government am a,c not mg personal about it, any personal expression of regret on his part would be useless and meaningless. , ^ replied that his Excellency must decide for himself, and that I could do no more than reiterate the express wishes of His Majesty’s Government which I had been ins ructed to explain to him and I would communicate his views to Constantinople. i again visited Abdul Wahab-el-Kartass at Saraji on the morning of the 9th instant, an ic o me e ad spent several hours with the Sheikh of Mohammerah at Failieh on the preceding day, and had read the vali’s private letter, which, he said, was /lend a ncl conciliatory He said good relations were restored and the breach ma e&lt; . consi er Abdul Wahab s opinion of value. He is an important personagehere and an intimate friend of Sheikh Khazal, and is well aware of the difficulties the Turks have had in past years with Mohammerah. No man in Bussorah knows the position better, and, when friendly meetings between Arab sheikhs and Turkish vali’s occur, they are generally held at his house (please see my despatch No. 14 of the v-me 9th March last to the embassy, to which the resident at Bushire recently referred m in his telegrams). I have, &amp;c. J. E. CROW. June 10, 1910. P.S. Since writing the above I have received a copy of the vali’s private letter to the Sheikh, and enclose a translation of it.

It is no secret that the said Mohd Chenan is a chief of the Muhaisin tribe and a Persian subject and that he is my agent there for the cultivation of my property. As notified by your representative, Saad Bey, I have removed him and will appoint another agent. As regards those who dared to kill Chelmecan, from the first day this news reached me 1 gave necessary and repeated orders to search for and arrest them, but up to the present 1 have not found any of them, and they are not people of this district. If they see them or if any one of them is found on this side I will undoubtedly arrest him and hasten to send him. As regai ds the affair at Menawee, when you mentioned it to me verbally I ordered search to be made for them, and the day before I left for the Karun I succeeded in catching three of them, but, as I was busy with my journey, I could not inform you and after my return I succeeded in catching one more, and asked the acting vali to . an °™ cia l 1° ta k e them and conduct them to the head-quarters of the vilayet. An official was sent to me with a reply and he took them. ^ You mentioned several matters of detail for me to undertake. As I am a Persian subject and hereditary frontier official of that Government, and a treaty exists between the two Islamic Powers regarding the extradition of criminals, of which your Excellency is doubtless aware, you and I cannot infringe this treaty, but, in view of the friendshin and agreement existing between us as neighbours, there has not been in the past and there will not be m the future any slackness in the necessary help or mutual assistance m all matters relating to the prevention of crime and the establishment of security in all districts, and up to to-day no infraction of the law has been committed by my tribes on Turkish territory, and I have exerted myself, and will exert myself as far as I can, to preserve peace and tranquillity such as we now enjoy until the last day.

WITH reference to the recent telegraphic correspondence on the subject of the quarrel between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Vali of Bussorah, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of two despatches (but not of their enclosures, which presumably have reached you already from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople) from His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah, giving an account of the question down to the L2th May. I see little in these reports that calls for any comment on my part at this stage, and I will therefore reserve any observations which I may have to offer on the case until I am in possession of the case for the Sheikh of Mohammerah, which has so frequently been mentioned in Colonel Cox’s telegrams. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M, MARLING. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Mr. Marling. ^ r ’ „ , _ Mohammerah, May 7, 1910. I HAVE the honour to forward, for your information, copies of the enclosed documents on the subject of the action taken by the Vali of Bussorah in satisfaction of certain alleged grievances against the Sheikh of Mohammerah. 2. I would also invite reference to the enclosed telegram on the subject 3. In explanation of the general question of the sheikh’s influence and interestin Turkish terntory, I would point out that more than half the Arabs occupying the date groves on the western (Turkish) bank of the Shatt-al-Arab belong to tribes which have been for the last 100 years subject to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The numerous islands in the river are occupied almost solely by his tribes, and of the eight headmen wno signed the agreement between the sheikh and the oil company relating to Abbadan Island, four live in Turkish territory, though they are undoubtedly Persian subjects, born, like their fathers, on Persian soil. 4. Hitheito no Vah of Bussorah has attempted to raise the question of nationality, and I am informed by Mirza Hamza, the sheikh’s Bussorah agent, that the Persian nationality of such tribesmen was explicity recognised by the Turks and formally recorded in the Government books. J The piesent vali, Sulaiman Nathif, has confined himself to the mere assertion that Muhammad Chanan, whom he sought to arrest, was a Turkish subject, and refused to discuss the question with Sheikh Khaz’al or his agent in any wav, until Muhammad Chanan had been handed over to him for punishment. l&gt;. This man is the head of the largest and most powerful of the tribes under the direct control of the sheikh, and is the latter’s brother-in-law. He has some 4,000 riflemen at his disposal in case of war. and provided some 2,000 to the sheikh in 1908, when the latter, with the authority of the Persian Government, was engao-ed in subduing the turbulent tribes of Hawaizah. His surrender, in any case, therefore would be a practical impossibility for the sheikh, and would alienate from the latter a large section of his tribesmen. He has not, moreover, been accused of any definite crime, and there is no reason as far as I am aware, to think that he has been in an}^ way concerned in crime or intrigues f° r some time past. On the contrary, for the last eighteen months the fehatt-al-Arab has been unprecedently quiet, and no outrages attributable in any way to the sheikh s tribesmen have occurred. J J 6. Until the middle of last month, the vali’s relations with Sheikh Khaz’al were ' [2824 d —17J COPY TO T—''’ '. 1 : 0 : zy. sec;.to apy’o ,.extremely cordial, and the latter had not the slightest idea that the former plated breaking with him suddenly and shelling his brother-in-law’s village bomb^rr 01 ' his mother’s house and ruining the sheikh’s personal property, on so flimsV a Dieted That he did so under orders from Constantinople is, I believe, certain, and it is wort?' ot note that his action coincided with the arrival of Nazim Pasha in Bao-b/ j accompanied by reinforcements of Turkish troops. a gaad, • 7 ; T' C !'.?'

U ^ k j? h P°^ lce assert that they have fled across the boundary in order to iustifv their inability to catch them. J r 8. The sheikh has in general afforded every assistance to the Turkish authorities m the apprehension of criminals, but in past times he has been considerably discouraged by the tact that such persons always escaped or were released by the Turks after a short time, and by the fact that no justice was ever obtainable in the Turkish criminal courts (m* Enclosures 6 and 7). He is not yet satisfied that there has been any substantial change m this respect. • -n 9 ' T? . a 'r tl0 “ tlle '’ ah in shelling and burning the village of Muhammad Chanan m the district of Zain. the personal property of Sheikh Khaz’al, seems to me to be unjustified from every point of view, and the official statement in the Bussorah newspaper (Enclosure No. 3) only confirms this opinion. It is unfortunate, too, that, whether by accident or design, the gunboat shelled and damaged without warning, the house of the sheikh s mother, close by, nearly frightening the old lady out of her wits. It is s ill more unfortunate that one of the sheikh’s wives, and sister of Muhammad Chanan who was m the latter’s village at the time, has since died of shock consequent on the bombardment. ^ These incidents have inflamed local opinion against the Turks. of tbo T rp 1S 11 ? dlcat i lon at present that the vali intends to raise the question hoptdkS; wr„ n ot dTso? 17 m the neighb0Urh0Od 0f Moha “ h ’ “ d * - , ■ 1 , have ad( |ressed the political resident in the Persian Gulf separately on this subject m my letter No. 255 of the 12th March, 1910.

The greater part of the contents of this despatch and of its enclosures has no -doubt reached you telegraphically, I have, however, ventured to submit translations ?T the original documents, together with a report on the situation, in the hope that it may not be wholly without interest by the time it reaches Tehran. 18. I have sent copies of this despatch to the political resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. regarding disorders there, of which you forwarded me a copy in your No. 951 of the 20th April, I have the honour to inform you that there is no doubt that in the time of the two previous Sheikhs of Mohammerah, Haji Jabur and Sheikh Mnzal, robberies at Bussorah were effectively used as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the Turkish authorities of Bussorah. 2. It is generally stated that the late outbreak of robberies at Bussorah and Abulkhasil were organised at Failia, and I consider it probable that that was the cause. The fact that they ceased on appointment of a new vali, as stated by Mr. Crow, certainly confirms this. I therefore agree with the first part of Mr. Crow’s letter. 3. The sheikh himself has now taken steps against the robbers, and, I am told, arrested twenty-five. Therefore, whether he instigated them or not, it appears that he only took action to stop them when relations between himself and the Bussorah authorities became more friendly. He himself only informs me that he arrested one man accused by the Bussorah police, and would have arrested another, but he, a relative of the nakib’s, was murdered. He also said that if the Bussorah authorities had evidence against anyone here he would arrest him; but that as bad characters were quite safe as' long as they kept on the Turkish side, he could not often take the steps he did some years ago, when he obtained the murder of two notorious pirates, kidnapping a third on Turkish territory. 4. The sheikh certainly has in his employ as guards (the best use to make of them) many ex-bandits, and their pay is small. He has only to shut his eyes to their absence, to allow them to rob, and he may do so, when the Bussorah authorities act against him. But his predecessors actually ordered them to make their raids, which the present sheikh has never been supposed to do. The last paragraph of Mr. Crow’s letter is the opinion the sheikh himself has As to the Ma‘kal case, I do not agree with Mr. Crow’s opinion that the sheikh did not assist—my opinion was that he did. But it is always very difficult to arrest men of the marsh Arabs, who are protected by their friends in the marshes; and as to the two men, there was reason to suspect that they were wanted by the Turks for other reasons. Sir &gt; T TT A x1 t , . Mohammerah, May 12, 1910. 1 HAVit the honour to forward copies of despatches addressed to His Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople by Mr. F. B. Crow, His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah on I have, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON, Lieutenant, I.A. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. always expressed—that the Turkish courts are the great obstacle to suppressing robbery and piracy. I have, &amp;c. W. MacDOUALL. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Political Resident, Bushire,the subject of the difficulties between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Vali of Bussorah, and of the result of negotiations between the two parties, together with a telegram of the subject of the rules regarding extradition in force between Turk and Persia. ^ . , 2. I can add little to Mr. Crow’s statement of the case, which seems to me in the^ main to represent the facts of the case from an impartial standpoint. 3. I think that the harbouring of bad characters by the sheikh is not so serious an evil or so deliberate a piece of mischief on the part of the sheikh as the Turks make out. It has been the_ policy of the sheikh, like all other Arab chiefs, to take such persons into his service, pay them, clothe them and feed them, and thus keep them under surveillance and out of mischief, whilst at the same time securing for himself an efficient bodyguard. It is only when the sheikh has been stirred to indignation by the ineptitudes of certain valis that he has connived at the perpetration of outrages by such persons with the object (usually successful) of securing the removal of the vali or the cessation of the practices objected to. 4. Nor can it be assumed that the sheikh is generally cognizant of outrages committed by his subjects. The reverse is the case. The latter, living in Turkish territory, have hitherto been emboldened to commit depredations by the knowledge that the Turkish police were not likely to disturb their operations, and tilt subsequent punishment was not likely to follow. They only occasionally bothered to take refuge in Mohammerah, being safe in Bussorah, a larger town, where they would not be known personally. 5. The proofs of the Persian nationality of Muhammad Chanan, which have been submitted to ^ me by the local authorities have satisfied me that he is a Persian subject according to international law, but this point has now ceased to have more than academic importance. 6. The settlement that has now been reached between the sheikh and the vali is shown by the enclosure to Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 26 of the 14th May.* It takes the form of a letter from the Turkish authorities to the sheikh, in which the latter set forth their case against the sheikh in brief and polite but forcible language, and announce their willingness to be friends with him if he will undertake to surrender fugitives and prevent his tribesmen from causing trouble in Turkish territory. i ' Something less than justice is done to the sheikh by this form of settlement, which is entirely in favour of the Turks. But this must be accepted as inevitable, since they are, owing to Persia’s weakness, nov predominant on the river, and preparing to make good their claim to exercise sovereign territorial rights in the Shatt-el-Arab, which they regard as the territorial waters of the Ottoman Empire, to which Persian vessels have access only by virtue of the special clause in the Treaty of Erzeroum. 7. ^ I hope to see the sheikh shortly, and shall urge on him the necessity of accepting tlm settlement, unsatisfactory though it may be, and of endeavouring to cultivate cordial relations with the Turks afresh. In the words of Mr. Crow, he must modernise his ideas with regard to them, and realise that the change of regime, in urkey, has brought about radical changes to which he must accommodate himself. • ^ f rus f that the Turks, on their part, will not again be so precipitate in their action should they have any cause of complaint, real or imaginary, against him.

WITH reference to your Excellency’s telegram of the 26th May communicating to me the Foreign Office telegram No. 113 to His Majesty’s representative at Tehran, I have the honour to report that on the 20th May I wrote to the acting vali privately, and suggested that some expression of regret should be made to the Sheikh of Mohammerah for the death of his wife and the inadvertent attack on his mother’s house, and that some reparation might be offered for the damage done to it I said I thought it would disarm criticism if this were done, and I proffered the suggestion in the best interests of the vali. The acting yali communicated my letter to the vali. I have the honour to enclose a copy of the vali’s reply as communicated to me by Saad Bey, and of my answer. The vali no doubt desires to receive the sheikh’s reply to his letter before making any advance, and he seems at present a little untractable, which is perhaps due to the handsome ovation he received on his arrival at Bagdad and the congratulatory telegram from Constantinople on his action at Zoin. But, if the sheikh answers in the way proposed by the Foreign Office, I hope to be able to persuade him to meet us in the matter. I am informing the acting vali to-day of the lines on which His Majesty’s Government hope to effect a reconciliation, as I gather from the vali’s telegraphic reply that he is disposed to resent my intervention, and it may reassure him to know that His Majesty’s Government are aware of his difficulties, and wish to give him reasonable assistance.

It will be seen that Shaikh Mubarak claims to have successfully parried the Vali’s suggestion, and this may be true, although the fact cannot be taken for granted. But this is only one of several straws which have recently served to indicate the direction of the wind, and I apprehend that, if it cannot be dis couraged from the fountain head, the activity of patriotic Turkish officials jn the Persian Gulf will at no distant date force us into issue with the Porte in con nection with several matters in regard to which the forward policy of the new regime clashes with our own interests.

My Russian Colleague saw an announcement to the same effect in the Turkish newspaper “ Iqaz”. I also heard from the Mutasarrif of Hasa, who was present, that the men were wanted for a gendarmerie camel corps at Hasa but he said they had not been collected yet.

Sheikh Mubarak said his own men were engaged in their own occupations and there were none he could call on for service of the kind required, far from their homes, but if the Vali wanted Arabs there were Nejada Camel-men and the like from Central Arabia to be found in Kuwait ; the Vali said he did not want them, but Shaikh Mubarak’s own people over whom the Shaikh would have a hold, to which the Shaikh replied that he was sorry he could not help for the reasons already given. No. C.-24, dated Kuwait, the nth May 1910. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honour to invite a reference to the telegrams passed between His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople relative to a rumoured proposal that Kuwait men are to be sent to Hasa for service as gendarmerie in that province under the Turkish authorities. 2. I mentioned the rumour to Shaikh Mubarak during recent conversation and he informed me that a paragraph to the above effect had appeared in an Arabic newspaper in Basrah, having apparently been purposely inserted by the Vali, but that the facts were as follows ;—The Vali had asked him to supply 20 or 30 men for gendarmerie in Hasa, for whom the Vali would provide a Turkish commander, pay, food, clothing, etc. ; the Shaikh had replied that he could not call on any of his people for such service as they were all engaged in their own vocations, boat-building, fishing, pearl-diving, trading, etc., that if Arabs were required, no doubt Nejada from Central Arabia could be found in Kuwait, of the class of men who took service with well-to-do people; that the Vali had said he particularly wanted Kuwaitis over whom the Shaikh would have a hold, and to this he had replied regretting that he was unable to assist the Vali. 3, There is, however, a rumour in the town, which I think probably has its source in the newspaper paragraph mentioned above, that not only was a Kuwait detachment to be sent to Hasa but that a Turkish zabit and some men were to be posted to Kuwait. I have had no opportunity of asking the Shaikh regarding the latter, and on the face of it it seems most improbable.FOREIGN OFFICE, June 23rd, 1910 24 JUN1910 With reference to previous correspondence rele nhemmera tive to the dispute between the Sheikh of and the Vali of Basra, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a testy’s Charge d 1 Affaires at despatch from His Tehran giving the substance of the reply which His Majesty's Consul at Moharrxnera has suggested that the former should return to the communication addressed to him by the latter I am to request that Viscount I.lorley's attention may be called to the last three paragraphs of the telegram from His Majesty's Consul General at Bushire paraphrase of which forms the enclosure in Mr Marling 1 s despatch, relative to the reported attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit Htfi-O-El V E D 30 a,m, J64JUN1S1C i&amp;DJA QFlhOi* Your most obedient humble Servant The Under Secretary of State India Officeio. 9 * 21775) Sir:- With reference to my telegram No.244 of the 29th ultimo I have the honour to transmit herewith paraphrase of a telegram, as marked in the margin, from His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire respecting the relations of the Sheikh of Mohammerah with the Vali of Basrah. I have &amp;c., (Signed) Charles M. Marling. COPV TO INDIA SEC' 'fr- if} Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.Paraphrase of telegram No. 162-562 of May 28th from His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire to His Majesty’s Charge d 1 Affaires, Teheran. f 'I have received to-day a letter from Lieutenant Wilson reporting conversation with Sheikh of Mohanmerah. The views of the Sheikh, he states, are exactly those set forth in Mohammerah telegram No.460 (see my telegram No.498 of May 13th) but he qualifies them by admitting that such retaliatory measures as he might have taken would only have been temporarily effectual since the Turks* rising naval power would in the end make them masters of the situation. V/ith regard to terms of Acting Vali’s letter Sheikh said with great earnestness that his honour was at stake and beg ged us to devise some solution whereby his prestige in the eyes of his followers should not be diminished. Letter was offensive both in tone and implication, he continued, and it was impossible for him to hand over fugitive criminals without a reciprocal arrangement on the part of the lurkish authorities, and even if such an arrangement were to be con cluded and he were to sign an undertaking such as that de sired by Vali, it would place the Turks in a position to ^ il ; * raiseraise trouble at will by pretending that Basrah police had 'ascertained' that the criminals had fled to Mohammerah territory. With a view to co-operation His Majesty's Consul at Mohamerah suggests following replies which in general have the concurrence of the Sheikh. 1. On the question of the Minawi robberies Sheikh will state that he had actually caught three of accused previous to his departure for Ahwaz and was about to sur render them where such a step was incidentally rendered impossible by the bombardment. 2. With regard to Chelmara murder he will reply that he was on intimate terms with the deceased and no one could be more anxious than himself to avenge the crime but he was not aware that the murderer had ever entered his territory. 3. He will agree not to send Mohammed Chenan back to Zain but maintains that he is a Persian subject and points out that notwithstanding that he brought him to Basrah to tender an explanation they were refused admit tance to the Vali until the Sheikh had surrendered Chenan.1' ! ir. who had married his sister, to the local authorities. 3. Concerning the surrender of fugitive criminals Sheikh proposes to reply that he is not empowered as a Persian subject under the authority of the Central Govern ment in Teheran, to conclude any formal extradition arrange ment with the Turkish Governor, but will promise to do his utmost to co-operate unofficially. With reference to the personal side of the question the Sheikh has urged that some reparation for action taken with the deliberate intention of damaging him should be offered by the Vali. He added that he has heard that since leaving Basrah Vali had warned Arab and Turkish Headmen to ■ refrain from having any sort of relations with Sheikh under threat of imprisonment and dismissal. His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah informed Sheikh that His Majesty's Government would endeavour to obtain an expression of regret in suit able terms from Vali. In conclusion Sheikh said that the affairs of Koweit were connected with the Vali's sudden action against him. It appeared that Sheikh Mobarak had lately been coquetting inin various ways with Vali of Basrah and had deferred to latter's wishes in regard to the enlistment in the gendar merie of 20 Koweit men. Mobarak had stated to Sheikh of Mohammerah that Vali had asked him for a grant of a piece of land in Koweit for a telegraph office and he had not discouraged Vali but had returned a temporising reply. Sheikh of Mohammerah stated that he had warned Mobarak that he was adopting a dangerous policy and would alien ate His Majesty's Government and as a result of his conversation Mobarak refused to hand over the land de finitely to Vali. Subsequently Vali informed a mutual friend tnat Sheikh of Mohammerah was now interfering in affairs of Koweit and damaging Turkish interests and that he would end it. I have not been able to obtain any information re garding the question of telegraph office but recent reports received from Koweit lend some colour to the statement concerning gendarmerie and to the coquetry generally. I think that, subject to your views, proposed replies of Sheikh are suitable.CONFIDENTIAL. PERSIA. Section 1 . [June 13.] [20904] No. 1. (No. 367.) Sir, Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received June 13.) 367 ) Constantinople, June 8, 1910. WITH reference to my despatch No. 349 of the 30th ultimo, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s consul^ at Bussorah giving an account of the negotiations between the vali and the Sheik oi Mohammerah through had shown him the conversation, as recorded in the telegraph office, between himself and the vali. The vali said he was glad to negotiate with Hajj Rms,^ that he wished no ill to the sheikh personally and did not want to offer him any indignity, but laid the whole blame on Mohammed Chenan. He said they were both governors ot their respective districts, and all he wanted from the sheikh was for him to keep his followers from causing disorders on Turkish territory, and not to conceal or protect criminals, who escaped from Turkey to Mohammerah, but to hand them over to justice. He This seems a reasonable attitude, and I told Haji Reis so. He quite agreed and 1 The Menawee incident. Three persons out of six asked for by the Turks were illv under arrest at Mohammerah, and would be handed over, and they were loo mg On the 8th May, Haji Reis received private information that orders had reached Shamil Pasha, the military commandant at Bussorah, to arrest him, and that he s ouk at once return to Mohammerah as soldiers were already sent out to catcti him. I said [2781 n —1] _ intermediary of Haji Reis. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 26.) Sir, AS reported in my telegram No. 23 of the 8th May, Haji Reis called on me on the 7th May after his interview with the acting vali and informed me that the latter Bussorah, May 14, 1910. questions :—2 I did not believe the Turks were capable of such a breach of faith, but, as a precaution I would send a cavass with him when he went to the acting vali, and I gave him ’ letter, copy inclosed, to hand to the latter. It was afterwards discovered that the information was merely given in order to frighten Haji Reis away and so break up the negotiation, and that there was no foundation for it. Haji Reis declined to give me the name of his informant, but as he had been calling on Seyyid Talib that mornin who arrived by the Russian steamer “ Tigre” on the 8th May, I surmise the information^ must have come from him. Haji Reis was very anxious I should say something specific to the Turks about the sheikh’s assurances from the British Government. I told him I saw no advantage in using such an argument, at all events at present, and I said I gave the acting vali clearly to understand in my interview with him on the 5th May that His Maiesty’s Government attached great importance to a settlement locally, and feared complications if it were not effected, as we had considerable interests of a commercial nature in Arabistan. I added the Turks were quite intelligent enough to perceive that the sheikh himself was one of those interests, and that we were protecting him ipso facto by our intervention at the present juncture. It seemed a pity, I said, to use a big nail which might split the plank, when a tin-tack would do the work. Haji Reis also consulted us as to what action the Persians should take in regard to the two official communications addressed by the vali to the Persian consul-general at Bussorah on the 26th Aprd, making direct accusations against the sheikh and covertly threatening to attack Mohammerah. I replied that my advice was to pigeonhole the letters and send no answer at all. I feared any reply might lead to an acrimonious correspondence and upset our work of reconciliation. Haji Reis promised me to advise the Persian consul- general accordingly, and I understand a mere formal acknowledgment will be sent. The acting vali informed Haji Reis on the 9th May that the vali agreed to his proposal about Mohammed Chenan, whom the sheikh will remove from Turkish territory, appointing another agent in his place at Zein ; that the questions between them were now settled in a friendly way, and there was nothing more. The letter addressed to me by the acting vali on the 8th May, in reply to mine, contained assurances to that effect. A copy of the acting vali’s letter is enclosed. Haji Reis replied, if all was now over, he would like him to write to the sheikh to say so, and that their disagreement had been ended in an amicable manner between himself and the acting vali. The acting vali replied that the sheikh should write first, -tlaji Reis then produced from his bag^ a letter written and sealed by the sheikh stating that he had sent Haji Reis as his plenipotentiary to settle matters, and handed it to the acting vali, adding that his instructions were to deliver the letter only if matters were settled in a satisfactory and friendly manner. The acting vali then agreed to give him his letter if he called later on in the afternoon. On Haii Reis’s calling m the evening of the same day, the acting vali told him there was another qiies ion pen mg w uch must be settled before he wrote. It appears that shortly after the Zein incident on the 25th April a certain Ishak, an Arab, presented a petition to the vali to the effect that Haji Mustafa, Mirza Hamza’s head moonshee and an oman su jec , iad threatened to kill him in the presence of witnesses. A quarrel ad occurred between them previously and Mustafa threatened Ishak, who now went . ear rr 18 V 6 ’, was a ^ ia j c ^ mention the matter before, fearing the wrath of l ^• nZa mi U ’ a .^' ei ^ e j n affair, he plucked up courage and denounced Mustafa ha w V + \ u- 6 ac ^ ia S ^ a -^ 1 Sa ^ Mustafa had gone to Mohammerah and must be sent back to take his trial m the usual way.

Haji Reis said one thing to the acting vali which I thoroughly endorse, in fact I intended to use the same argument with the vali mvsclf if called upon to discuss the matter with him. It was to the effect that if the Turks had any grievance against Chenan, who was living on Turkish territory, let them tel ^' the sheikh that they refused to have him in the country, and the sheikh would exuef him from his lands at Zein and put another person in his place, which would be a punishment for Chenan and the Turks would he rid of a knave. This is, I think a very sound argument and we might work upon those lines. ’ • I repeated the substance of my interview with Haji Reis in my telegram No ^ I drew his attention to the absolute necessity of getting the sheikh to modernise his views on the subject of border relations and of aiding him to realise the genuineness of Turkey’s wish for reform. The truth is the Turks have hitherto played such a pitiable part here that it is not strange the Arabs should think no good can come from them I said some arrangement would have to be made and adhered to for the surrender of criminals who evaded justice. He replied the Turks could not keep them when they got them. There is truth in that. Evasions from prison used to be frequent, and once in the Maghil case, I had Khuleyf brought up from Mohammerah and turned loose in a garden, and sent 1 5 Zapties, my dragoman, and the Tabour Agassi to catch him, and they let him slip through their hands. I mentioned the attacks on Abul Khassib in 1908 and on Bussorah 1909, and the sheik’s pranks during Moharrem Bey’s governorship, which sometimes almost partook of the character of a Florentine “ beffa ” of the middle ages. Haji Reis could not deny that the sheikh was somewhat given to wreak his vengeance on any particular vali he disliked by stirring up trouble in the vilayet in order to discredit him. I pointed out what wretched tactics these were besides being very unfair on the sufferers, and Haji Reis agreed and promised to offer better counsels. I understand the sheikh is very much in the hands of his advisers, and I believe Haji Reis is one of the best of them. For my own part I rather distrust Mirza Hamza, Matters are somewhat complicated by two letters which the vali addressed to the Persian consul-general on the 26th April, of which Haji Reis gave me copies in Turkish. I enclose a literal translation of them. From these it will be seen that the vali accuses the sheikh of harbouring bad characters to the detriment of the vilayet, and this is, I think, strictly true. He states further that he will use the force at his command to protect Ottoman territory against interference from the sheikh. Turkish officials under the new regime seem to me half intoxicated with liberty and dazed with the accession of power and, like schoolboys out for a holiday, they may make sad misuse of it. An impetuous man like Nazif Bey requires a good deal of holding. He has his points, he is no liar and is clean handed, but he is not a very experienced governor and is most undiplomatic in his methods. In the second letter to the Persian consul-general the vali demands the arrest of Mohammed Chenan. I do not understand his allusion to attacks on farms (“ bazi muqatalera tejavuz itmessi uzerine ”). As far as we know Chenan prevented the zapties from turning out certain refractory “fellahs” from the land of a certain Mishri at Dowasir. He seems to have supported them because they weie fellow clansmen, and he went rather far when the Tabour Agassi was sent to arrest him, Chenan, by saying that Mishri’s agent would be killed if the arrest was insisted on. I have heard nothing else specified against him except the vague accusation that he is a brigand. Chenan, so Mr. Wilson informs me, is the headman of an important tribe subject to Sheikh Khazal, though the Turks claim him to l&gt;e an Ottoman subject. 1 have so far received no proof of his Ottoman or Persian nationality. The lurks say they can prove their contention and the Persians say the same. The only senous part of the vali s letter is the covert threat in the last sentence, in which he clearly menaces^ Mohammerah. I do not know how far he is acting on orders from Constantinople in making this statement, . ^ further complication is the death of one of the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s wives, a sister of Chenan, who resided with the sheikh’s mother, Gulfidan, in the latter’s house at Zein, which was inadvertently bombarded by the Turks. The lady died of fright caused by the bombardment. Haji Reis mentioned the matter to the acting vali but said they had no desire to press it. I have, &amp;c. F. E.

A REPORT reached me in the middle of April last from a confidential source that the Vali of Bussorah had, under instructions from the Ministries of War and of the Interior, called on the Sheikh Mubarak to take twenty-one men from Koweit for gendarmerie service at Hassa, to which the sheikh had agreed. The Ministry of the Interior, however, denied that any such orders had been sent to the vali, who on his side declared to the resident of Bushire that they had been issued to him by the Ministry at his own request. The vali said the actual orders were to take one sergeant and twenty men from tribes subject to Mubarak, the sheikh being free to make his own selection, but being required to give his guarantee for them. They were wanted, it was said, for the gendarmerie camel corps at Hassa. Sheikh Mubarak’s version of the story, which has now reached me, is that the vali had asked him for some twenty to thirty men from Koweit for the gendarmerie in Hassa, for whom the vali would supply a commander, pay, food, and clothing. The sheikh said that his men had their own personal occupations, and he had no one available for such service ; but if the vali desired Arabs there were Nejada camel men and others from Central Arabia to be found in Koweit. The vali replied that he did not wish these, but the sheikh’s own men, over whom he would have control, whereupon the sheikh declined to assist the vali for the reasons already given. I have, &amp;c.

In such a case he would of course receive the strongest diplomatic support. Colonel Cox should record in writing the substance of the conversation in the course of which this intimation is made to the Sheikh). “These assurances are given for your self and are intended to extend to your male descendants so long as you and they shall not have failed to observe your obli gations towards the Central Government and shall continue to be acceptable to your tribesmen, to be guided by the advice of His Ida jesty 's:o$ 'I Majesty’s Government and to maintain an at titude satisfactory to them”.

P? 0, Bussorah, April 23, 1910. ir&gt; AS a result of the good understanding between the vali of Bussorah and Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah, the latter some three months ago promised to aid the Turkish authorities to preserve the peace in this vilayet and to hand over criminals [2744 re—1] B^ 2 from Turkish territory who sought refuge in the sheikh’s domains. Khazal also under took not to let disturbers of the peace cross the river to Turkey. Last month robbers attacked a house at Manawi, a village close to this consulate. It was reported to the authorities that one of the servants was a servant of Mirza Hamza, the sheikh’s agent at Bussorah, that he had fled to Mohammerah, and that the^ sheikh declined t# give him up. On the 2nd April Kassim Chelmeran, proprietor of the local newspaper “ Idhar-el-Haq” was killed by his labourers at Ajariwieh, a few miles below this consulate, on the opposite side of the river, in Turkish territory, and the murderers sought refuge at Mohammerah. These people were not handed oyer to the Turkish authorities. Besides this, it is reported that there are many criminals fugitives from justice at Mohammerah, and when Sheikh Khazal is asked to give them up he denies their presence there. We had similar grounds of complaint against the authorities at Mohammerah in connection with the Maghil case and the murder of Mr. Glanville in 1906, as your Excellency will see from the correspondence on the subject. Last month Muhammad Bey-al-Meshri applied to the Turkish authorities in the usual way to remove certain fellah from his property at Dowasir. ^ The authorities tried to carry out the orders given for their removal but without success, and the trespassers were supported in their opposition to the local authorities by one Muhammad-al-Chanan, who, with the followers, lives at Zam, on Turkish territory. The vali sent the Tabur Agassi, with fifteen gendarmes, to arrest Muhammad-al- Chanan. This they were not able to do, and were informed, in answer to their demands, that all the people there belonged to Sheikh Khazal and were unable to come to Bussorah, and if the arrest were insisted on, the agent of Muhammad Bey-al-Mishri at Dowasir would be killed in the same manner as Kassim Chelmeran. The Tabur Agassi returned to Bussorah and informed the vali accordingly. Muhammad-al-Chanan seems to have applied to Sheikh Khazal for protection, and when the latter was requested by the vali to hand Chanan over, as he was an Ottoman subject residing on Turkish territory, the sheikh refused to do so, contending that the man belonged to him. On the 18th April, however, Sheikh Khazal brought up Muhammad Chanan with him in his yacht as a guest to Bussorah, and wished to call on the vali with him to discuss the affair, but the vali refused to see either Khazal or Chanan, and demanded that the latter should be handed over in the usual way, and if this were done he would be pleased to receive the sheikh. Sheikh Khazal then returned to Mohammerah with his guest, and relations with Bussorah are somewhat strained in consequence. Mirza Hamza left shortly after for Mohammerah. In conversation with me the vali said he had no intention of giving way in the matter, and if the sheikh did not concede his demands he would send the “ Marmaris” to Zain, which is Turkish territory, to demonstrate and if necessary punish Chanan and his retainers for their resistance to his demands. The vali said he had some opportunity of studying Sheikh Khazal and thoroughly distrusted him. His influence was great as a landowner and a tribal chief on the Turkish side of the river, and he thought that most of the mughtars of the village from Abul- Khasib down were in his pay or pledged to his interests. He attributed all the river troubles from Bussorah to Fao to his sinister influence, and has as a precaution changed or was changing all the local headmen who were under the sheikh’s influence, and was putting his own men. He said the Government had now means at its disposal of showing strength and he meant to take strong action. I have, &amp;c. F. E. CROW. Copy of the foregoing despatch forwarded to His Majesty’s acting consul at Mohammerah, with the compliments of the undersigned. F. E. CROW, His Majesty's Consul. Bussorah, April 23, 1910. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Consul Crow. (Confidential.) My dear Crow, Mohammerah, April 24, 1910. I HAVE to thank you for sending me a copy of your No. 22 to Constantinople on the subject of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the vali. _I am sending a copy to the resident in Bushire, and have little doubt that the latter will mention the matter to the sheikh when he comes up here, as is expected shortly. As regards the vali’s claim to jurisdiction over Muhammad Chanan, I ought to point ^ut that he is the chief of one of the principal tribes of the Sheikh ol Mohammerah, from whom the latter derives much of his strength, influence, and revenue. He^ is, I believe, undoubtedly a Persian subject, born and bred in Persia, and only transferred to his present abode within the last decade, after a chequered career in other parts of Arabistan. I am obtaining more definite information on the subject. For the sheikh to hand over such a man to the Turkish authorities is unprecedented,^ and difficult in the extreme and you could perhaps suggest this point to the vali, if opportunity offers ; it is not a case of surrendering an ordinary malefactor, but a headman of the most powerful tribe in the district of Mohammerah. Haji Athbi is another important tribal leader domiciled in Turkey in Umm-ur- Rassas, but undoubtedly in my belief a Persian subject, as he has only recently moved there, with most of his men, and in any case he and his tribe have always been recognised as Persian subjects, and have always fought for the sheikh in his wars. For the precise position of the houses of the two men please see my map of the Shatt-el-Arab, sent to you in December. I understand that Persia and Turkey have their own arrangements regarding jurisdiction and extradition, but whether this is the case or not, I venture to think that the vali would do well to recognise that the case of Muhammad Chanan is not on all fours with other cases of extradition of criminals, in which he has had reason to complain. This, of course, with no prejudice to the rights and wrongs of the general question. Muhammad Chanan and Haji Athbi are members of the tribal council which meets at Failieh, and were amongst the eight tribal leaders who signed the agreement between the sheikh and the oil company, with reference to the land required for refinery and pipe line. I hope to come to Bussorah next Sunday and will discuss this question with you personally. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Consul Crow. My dear Crow, Mohammerah, April 26, 1910. PLEASE refer to my D.O. of the 24th instant on the subject of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the vali of Bussorah. I left Bussorah at midday on the 25th, and at P30 p.m. passed the “ Marmaris,” which was returning to Bussorah. On my return to Mohammerah I learnt that at about midday the village of Muhammad Chanan, in Zain (Turkish territory), opposite Mohammerah, had been burnt and looted by Turkish soldiers, and that ten shots had been fired from the ship’s guns. . I saw Mirza Hamza and urged him to keep people quiet, and then went with Haji Mushir, son of Haji Reis, to view the damage and ascertain the real facts. It appears that about forty Turkish soldiers were sent by land and an equal number by river to Muhammad Chanan’s village, which they looted and burnt to the number of about sixty huts, some of which were quite unconnected with Muhammad Chanan. They did as much wanton damage as they could, burning planks, bellams, doors, &amp;c. They then retired, and shortly afterwards the gun-boat opened fire, smashing down several date trees and doing some damage to the house, not of Muhammad Chanan, but of Haji Gulfidan, wife of the late Sheikh Haji Jabir, and mother of the present sheikh. • . i i r* I surmise with what accuracy I cannot say—that the gun-boat intended to fire on Muhammad Chanan’s house, but missed it and hit the house of the old lady, which is in the line of fire. His Excellency Sheikh Khazal is now in Ahwaz, but will, I expect, shortly return. . I have wired to Colonel Cox giving him a brief account of what occurred. Mirza Hamza tells me that on the 25th soldiers from the “ Marmaris ” demanded the persons of Muhammad Chanan, Haji Athbi, and Barak-bin-Nafta, brother of Haji Arak. The second-named is head of the Umm-ur-Rassas tribe, which is tributary tothe sheikh. The third-named is brother of another headman, and has always lived and had business exclusively on Persian soil. All three are, in my opinion, Persian subjects. Failing to get possession of these men, they yesterday imprisoned M’atuk-bin- Nafta, brother of Barak, and his son, who are also, I believe, indisputably Persian subjects. I will defer for the present troubling you with an expression of view as to the political or legal aspect of the case. All I would remark is that the vali’s action seems to me to be unjustifiable and high-handed, and not calculated to further the peace of the district, unless he is prepared to reinforce his present armaments. I am sending a copy of this letter to Bushire. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Consul-General Cox. (No. 404.) (Telegraphic.) P. Mohammerah, April 25, 1910. SHEIKH and vali of Bussorah. Turkish gun-boat “ Marmaris ” to-day shelled and burnt village of Muhammad Chanan, opposite Mohammerah, in Turkish territory, the property of Sheikh of Mohammerah. Damage done about 600L Yali of Bussorah did this, I am told, under orders from Constantinople, as a punishment to the owner of the village, who is head of one of the largest tribes of the sheikh, because he refused to allow himself to be arrested by the vali’s men, being a Persian subject, according to his own statement, which is, I believe, correct under international law, and in any case, as head of Persian tribe, he has always been recognised as such. No definite proof of misdoing has been adduced against him by vali, who acted on hearsay, and would not allow Sardar Arfa to intervene. Moreover, gun-boat has captured and imprisoned an important leader of sheikh’s tribes for no known reason, and man is undoubtedly a Persian. Sheikh now in Ahwaz, but will, I expect, come back. I have not left Mohammerah. Incident has caused great excitement, and reprisals are probable. I have begged local authorities to keep quiet. I am going to Bussorah this evening to see His Majesty’s consul at that port. Full details by mail. Telephone message posted the 27th April, 1910, to Wilson:— “Pour telegram No. 404 received.

Sheikh has wired to Mirza Hamza, his Bussorah agent now in charge of Mohammerah, telling him that he is to act strictly in accordance with whatever advice I give him, and also asked if it was desirable for him to leave Nasiri or not. I have advised the sheikh not to leave Ahwaz for the present, as his hasty arrival will cause comment and show that he is afraid of the actions of the vali. As regards settlement between the sheikh and the vali, I have advised the sheikh s agent to go to Bussorah shortly and interview the vali. /To say that the whole question of the vali’s action in burning the village turns on whether Muhammad Chanan is a Persian or a Turkish subject. If the former, the vali is not justified; if the latter, he is. He should suggest that the question of the nationality of Muhammad Chanan should be referred to some impartial and skilled person such as His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah, so as to obtain an independent verdict.* He should do nothing to give the Turks an excuse for further aggressive action, and should be conciliatory. He should consult His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah before acting. His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah reports that Turks are shortly bringing out wo more gun-boats. (Copy by post to Bussorah.) Enclosure 8 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Consul-General Cox. (No. 4-3.) Mohammerah, April 30, 1910. I HAVE the honour to forward copies of correspondence on the subject of the action of the Turks vis-d-vis the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in continuation of my letter ot the 27th 2 AP I beg 9 to offer the following comments on Mr. Crow’s despatch No. 46 of the 27^1^ April • 3 . The evidence that is available here tends to show that Muhammad Chanan is, according to international law, a Persian subject. , , . 4. Although it is no doubt true that the Turks have not been able to exact redress in the past, it is equally true for the same reason, they have been wholly unable to keep order on their side of the river and in Bussorah, and the sheikh has had frequent cause to complain of this. It has always been a convenient excuse for the Turkish subordinate officials to report that the criminal in question had fled to Mohammerah ; vt is known that facilities for so doing were not infrequently afforded them by the said ofhcia s. _ 5 . The question of the frontier, so far as it affects Eaiheh, raised by the vah, is dealt with in mv letter to you No. 255 of the 12th March, 1910. 6 Minawi and Ajariwieh (mentioned in His Majesty’s consul s Bussorah, despatch No 22 of the 23rd April) are in Turkish territory, close to Bussorah, and there is not I believe, the slightest evidence beyond the interested assertions of the Bussorah police co show that the crimes there are in any way connected with Mohammerah. Mirza amza assures me most definitely that the murderer is at present in Turkish territory m Diaji, and that the Bussorah police are afraid to apprehend them. 7 The case of Mohamed Mishri, also mentioned in the despatch above quoted, has another aspect. The removal of “ fellahs in the usual way ’’ is a euphemism for an attempt on the part of the Turks to oust the tenants of certain lands (alleged to be Persian subjects) without reference to the Turkish courts of law, m favour of the Turkish owner. It is not stated who gave the message to the Tabur Agassi that Mishi would be killed in the same way as Chelmeran, if the arrest of Muhammad Chanan were insisted on. It is strenuously denied here, and seems inherently improbable that Muhammad Chanan, or his men, would have been so foolish to utter such a threat to fifteen armed gendarmes on Turkish soil. The story is not unlikely to be a fabrication on the part of Turkish subordinate officials with the object of causing trouble between th6 S 8 6 The vali demands that Muhammad Chanan be handed over, and his refusal to even discuss the matter with Sheikh Khazal seems to be arbitrary and unjustifiable- As headman and hereditary leader of one of the sheikh’s tribes, it is impossible for the sheikh to hand him over to the vali without incurring the hostility of a powerful section of the tribes who uphold him. I have, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON, Lieutenant, I.A. Enclosure 9 in No. 1. Consul Crow to Acting Consul Wilson. My 0 dtai^ Wilson, Bus Wi, April 27, 1910 I HAVE your letter of this evening. A list of about twenty-five people was sent to the sheikh,” giving names of persons wanted for various matters connected with The vali could not tell me anything against Haji Athbi, and did not seem to know the name, but said that the cases of the persons asked for would be dealt with judicially [2744 ee — 1 ] Cif surrendered. I told him it might be extremely difficult for the sheikh, as an Arab, to surrender either Chanan or Athbi, who were chiets of some of his most powerful tribes, as such a surrender would be contrary to Arab customs and tribal rules. The vali said Chanan was an Ottoman subject resident in Turkey, and even if he were not^ an Ottoman subject he was concerned in past troubles on the river. The Tur] f hitherto had not been able to exact redress, but^ that time was over. The sheikh in years past had frequently been asked to restrain his adherents from disturbing the peace of the vilayet. He had not done so. As he protected these people and refused to surrender them, the vali said he had no choice in the latter [sic] but to take his own measures. My impression is that the vali is acting on instructions from Constantinople, and I hear that he wired after refusing the sheikh when the latter brought up Chanan to Bussorah. I do not think anything fresh is contemplated at present, unless the sheikh gives cause by raising his tribes and creating trouble. In that case the Turks might move against Failieh or destroy some of the sheikh’s property in Bussorah. I notice that they pulled down part of a new house which the sheikh is erecting on the Asshar Creek, near the bridge, but they did not do much damage, and the proceedings were stopped, I hear, by the vali in person. At the same time they pulled down part of Khaderi’s new house (unfinished) a little lower down, but I do not attach much importance to these incidents. The vali spontaneously told me that the sheikh’s house at Failieh, which he called “ Persian yildiz,” was, strictly speaking, situated in Turkey, according to the line of demarcation laid down by the commission. He seems to have learnt this from Constantinople. The Turkish officials are childishly exultant over the Zain affairs, and matter must rest awhile till they are cooler. There have been no troubles on the river, as far as I know, except the recent affairs at Ajariwieh and Minawai and Chibasi, but, according to my reports to the embassy, there is a heavy cumulative record against Mohammerah from September 1908 to the 31st March, 1909, and most of the offenders were traceable to your district. Apart from this, I have in previous years repeatedly called the attention of our Government to the attitude of the sheikh in regard to river troubles generally, and to disturbances in Bussorah in particular. On one occasion during the hunt for Glanville’s murderers in 1906 and 1907 representations were made at my instance to the sheikh through Tehran. To the best of my recollection the sheikh took the matter lightly. My efforts to get the sheikh to co-operate with the Turks and aid them to suppress lawlessness have been unavailing. The day of reckoning seems to have come, and I think it is high time the Turks took up the matter themselves. Their action may be arbitrary, but if they have the force to carry it through—and I shall ask the embassy to press for supply of proper means—it will, I am sure, in the end be salutary as far as this vilayet is concerned. Yours sincerely, F. E. CROW. Enclosure 10 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Consul-General Cox. My dear Colonel Cox, Mohammerah, April 30, 1910. IN continuation of my letter No. 423 of even date, I enclose a copy of a demi- official letter which I have just received from His Majesty’s consul, Bussorah, on the subject of the trouble between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the vali and my reply. The departure of the vali to Bagdad is very fortunate and will minimise the likelihood of any further troubles in the immediate future. The sheikh has assured me, through Mirza Hamza, that he will take no measures of any kind which might be treated as reprisals; this is in accordance with the advice I gave him in the first instance. Mr. Crow’s letter, enclosed, refers to an interview that he had with Haji Mushir, son of Haji Reis, at my suggestion. I did not, however, at any time mention the question of guarantee for the sheikh’s Bussorah property and quite agree with Crow that he should get it through the Persian Embassy or else from the vali. I am probably going off to Khor Kuwairin to finish some more of the survey on Sunday next, returning in time for the mail. Yours sincerely, A. T. WILSON.Enclosure 11 in No. 1. Consul Crow to Acting Consul Wilson. Ily dear Wilson, Bussorah, April 28, 1910. I TOLD Mushir that I would write privately to the yali and ask him to protect Mirza Hamza’s wife and family, but I thought under the circumstances they would be better away from here. I do not think the vali is at all likely to do them harm , but I cannot answer for developments and they might be exposed to annoyance and supervision. As regards Persian property in Bussorah, I would advise the sheikh to get his guarantee through the Persian Embassy; the difficulty will probably be discussed between them and the Porte, and any local promise I might give would be easily over-ruled. Mushir said he agreed they would be better away and my letter was not required. . , The question, I think, turns on reprisals as regards further damage being done. The vali leaves on Saturday for Bagdad and will be away a month with Nazim Pasha. Yours sincerely, F. E. CROW. Enclosure 12 in No. 1. Acting Consul Wilson to Consul Crow.

I am sorry that Haji Mushir did not consent to your writing to the vali privately and asking him to look after Mirza Hamza’s family, and so is Mirza Hamza. Ihe latter points out, and I agree with him from my point of view, that for him to take away his family from Bussorah now would give rise to much comment and tend to magnify instead of minimising recent occurrences. Turks, I suppose, are much the same as Persians and other Orientals in that they become dangerous and bold only when they see the enemy is afraid. I think that if Mirza Hamza s family were to )e withdrawn, it would be interpreted as a sign of fear. . • . i u - I understand that he is strongly of this opinion that he is not going to take his family away.

(No. 22.) gi r Bussorah, April 23, 1910. AS a result of the good understanding between the vali of Bussorah and Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah, the latter, some three months ago, promised to aid the Turkish authorities to preserve the peace in this vilayet, and to hand over criminals from Turkish territory who sought refuge in the sheikh’s domains. Khazal also undertook not to let disturbers of the peace cross the river to Turkey. Last month robbers attacked a house at Menawee, a village close to this consulate. It was reported to the authorities that one of the robbers was a servant of Mirza Hamza, the sheikh’s agent at Bussorah, that he had fled to Mohammerah, and that the sheikh declined to give him up. On the 2nd April, Kassim Chelmeran, proprietor of the local newspaper “ Idhar el Hakk,” was killed by his labourers at Ajerawiye, a few miles below this consulate on the opposite side of the river, in Turkish territory, and the murderers sought refuge at Mohammerah. These people were not handed over to the _ Turkish authorities. Besides these, it is reported that there are many criminals, fugitives from justice, at Mohammerah, and when Sheikh Khazal is asked to give them up he denies their presence there. Wb had similar grounds of complaint against the authorities at Mohammerah m connection with the Maghil case, and the minder of Mi. Gdanville in 1906, as your Excellency will see from the correspondence on the subject. Last month Mohammed Bey el Moshree applied to the Turkish authorities in the usual way to remove certain fellahs from his property at Dowasir. The authorities tried to carry out the orders given for their removal, but without success, and the trespassers were supported m their opposition to the local authorities by one, Mohammed el Chinan, who, with his followers, lies at Zein, on Turkish territory. The vali sent the Tabour Agassi with fifteen gendarmes to arrest Mohammed el Chenan. This they were not able to do, and were informed in answer to their demands that all the people there belonged to Sheikh Khazal, and were unable to come to Lussorah, and if the arrest was insisted on, the agent of Mohammed Bey el Moshree, at Dowasir, would be killed m the same manner as Kassim Ohelmeian. The .labour Agassi returned to Bussorah and informed the vali accordingly. Mohammed Chinan seems to have applied to Sheikh Khazal for protection, and when the latter was requested by the vali to hand Chinan over, as he was an Ottoman subject residing on Turkish territory, the sheikh refused to do so, contending that the man belonged to him. On the 18th April, however, Sheikh Khazal brought up Mohammed Chinan with him in his yacht as a guest to Bussorah, and wished to call on the vali with him and discuss the affair. But the vali refused to see either Khazal or Chinan, and demanded that the latter should be handed over in the usual way, and if this were done, he would be pleased to receive the sheikh. Sheikh Khazal then returned to Mohammerah with his guest, and relations with Bussorah are somewhat strained in consequence. Mirza Hamza left shortly afterwards for Mohammerah.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul Crow to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 23.) Sir, Bussorah, April 28, 1910. WITH reference to my despatch No. 22 of the 23rd instant, and my telegrams Nos. 16 and 17 of the 25th and 26th instants, I have the honour to enclose copies of two letters received from the acting British consul at Mohammerah. The “ Marmaris ” which had been anchored near Zein for several days returned to Bussorah on the 24th instant and left for Zein again early on the 25th instant. The village of Zein, which is on the Turkish side of the Shatt and is occupied by Mohammed Chenan and his tribesmen, w T as burnt and bombarded at midday on the 25th instant. Men in boats landed with kerosine oil and, accompanied by forty soldiers despatched overland, burnt about sixty huts and the house of Chenan and looted all the property they could find. They then retired and bombarded the place with the guns of the “ Mannaris.’* The mutessarif of Hassa, who was on the ship, told me there was an explosion in Chenan’s house, when fired, which he attributed to the ammunition stored there. Lieutenant Wilson’s letter gives details of the operations gathered during a personal visit to Zein after the incident. According to the vali the firing on Gulfidan’s house (the lady is the mother of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and was in residence at the time) was due to a mistake. The house was apparently in the line of fire and they could not see it through the trees. There was no casualties. I saw the vali on the 27th instant, and he told me a list of about twenty-five persons was sent to the sheikh, giving the names of persons wanted for various matters connected with troubles on the river in Turkish territory. The vali could tell me nothing about Haji Athbi, mentioned in Lieutenant Wilson’s letter, and did not seem to know the name. He said the cases of the persons asked for would be dealt with judicially if they were surrendered. I told him it might be extremely difficult for the sheikh, as an Arab, to surrender either Chenan or Athbi, who were chiefs of some of his most powerful tribes, a,s such a surrender would be contrary to Arab custom and tribal rules. I observed that in dealing with the Arabs we usually respected their tribal customs. The vali contradicted me, and said we treated them with great severity. He said Chenan was an Ottoman subject resident in Turkey, and even if he were not an Ottoman subject, which he declared was not the case, he was concerned in past troubles on the river, and had lately defied his authority. The Turks hitherto had not been strong enough to exact redress, but that time was over. The sheikh in past years had frequently been asked to restrain his adherents from disturbing the peace of the vilayet. He had not done so. As he protected these people and declined to surrender them, the vali said he had no choice in the matter but to take his own measures. My impression is that the vali is acting on instructions from Constantinople, as I hear he telegraphed after refusing to receive the sheikh when the latter brought * Printed with paper 18937. [2744 gg —3]Chenan to see him at Bussorah. I do not think anything fresh is contemplated at present unless the sheikh gives cause by raising his tribes^ and creating trouble or attempting reprisals. In that case the Turks might move against Failiyah or destroy some of the sheikh’s property at Bussorah. I noticed that they pulled down part of a new house which the sheikh is erecting on the Ashar creek near the bridge, but thejf did not do much damage, and the proceedings were, I hear, stopped by the vali in person. At the same time they also pulled down part of a new unfinished house belonging to an Ottoman subject, Kassim Khederi, agent of the Bombay and Persian line at Bussorah, which stands close to the sheikh’s house. I do not attach importance to these incidents. The vali said he respected good people and strong people, and as the sheikh was neither he was not going to show him any mercy. It was an etat de guerre, and I hear he has issued a manifesto to that effect to his mutessarifs and ka'imakams and other officials in the vilayet. The vali spontaneously told me that the sheikh’s house at Failiyah, which he called “ a Persian yildiz,” was, strictly speaking, situated in Turkey, according to the line of demarcation laid down by the boundary commission. He seems to have learnt this from Constantinople. I did not discuss this matter with him, but I gather from Lieutenant Wilson that this statement is correct, although both the Turkish and Persian Governments agreed subsequently to respect the status quo, which has now existed for over half-a-century, and according to which the actual frontier is at Diaiji. The Turkish officials are childishly exultant over the Zein affair, and matters must rest awhile till they are cooler. The vali leaves on Saturday, the 30th instant, for Bagdad, to meet Nazim Pasha, and expects to be absent about a month. With the exception of the affairs at Ajerawiyeh, where the proprietor of the Izhar-el-Hakk was murdered, that at Menawee, in which a servant of Mirza Hamza was implicated, and an episode at Chibasi, of which I have not received details, there have not, as far as I am aware, been any cases of river piracy or disturbances round Bussorah since April 1909, but in the winter of 1908—1909 the river was much disturbed. I would refer your Excellency to Mr. Geary’s despatches No. 76 of the 17th October, No. 79 of the 31st October, and his telegram No. 57 of the 5th November, and my telegrams No. 60 of the 18th November, No. 61 of the 30th November, and my despatches No. 89 of the 5th December, 1908; No. 2 of the 15th January, No. 9 of the 13th February, and my telegrams No. 10 of the 13th February, No. 12 of the 16th February, No. 16 of the 26th February, No. 19 of the 2nd March, and No. 21 of the 16th March, 1909. The causes of the disturbances which occurred up river in the spring of 1909 were summarised in my despatch No. 20 of the 31st March, 1909. There is a heavy cumulative record against Mohammerah from September 1908 to the 31st March, 1909, and most of the offenders were traceable there. The name of the Sheikh of Mohammerah figures largely in my reports, and, during seven years residence at this post I have had frequent occasion to draw tbe attention of His Majesty’s Embassy, notably in the Maghil case and the murder of Mr. Glanville in 1906, to the sheikh’s baneful influence in this vilayet and his unwillingness to co-operate with the Turkish authorities by delivering criminals who sought asylum at Mohammerah or by restraining the many lawless tribes subject to his influence in Turkish territory from committing acts of brigandage, murder and piracy. On one occasion during the hunt for Glanville’s murderers in 1906-1907 representations were made, at my instance, to the sheikh through Tehran. To the best of my recollection the sheikh took the matter lightly. Daheysh, one of the culprits, who confessed his complicity before me, admitted before the court-martial that Mirza Hamza, the sheikh’s representative, had promised to deliver him, as he put it, “ out of the mouth of the lions.” My efforts to get the sheihh to aid the Turks to suppress lawlessness on the river have been unavailing. He cannot plead he has not been warned. The day of reckoning now seems to have come, and I think it is high time the Turks took up the matter themselves. The action of the vali at Zein, though no doubt arbitrary as Turkish methods usually are, is not, I think, wholly unwarranted in view of past history, and if he has the force to carry it through, such incidents may prove salutary as far as this vilayet is concerned. The commodore informs me that some motor gun-boats have been ordered for use on the river. It will no doubt aid the authorities if these gun-boats are expedited. I would therefore urge your Excellency to press for their completion and dispatch as soon as possible. I have, &amp;c. F. E.

IT has been ascertained on good authority that Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah keeps agents and serkars, under various names, for strengthening his influence in your district, and has recourse to various means and intrigues in order to get persons attached to him appointed as mukhtars. It is also certain that the authors of many crimes, murders, and robberies committed in the sanjak of Bussorah are concealed by him. It is most essential that, apart from the lawful authority of the Ottoman Govern ment, no foreign Power should exercise influence in the Ottoman dominions, and that the application and enforcement of Ottoman laws and justice should not be impeded or delayed by any (extraneous) influence or interest. It is a most important duty incumbent on the officers of the Government to break and destroy the unlawful influence in Turkish territory of such a person, who, profiting by the carelessness and improvidence of past times, is a source of calamity to his own country, and even ventures to harbour malefactors to the detriment of the Imperial Government.

From various telegrams received from Cox, following appears to be the present position :— Crow and Wilson have discussed the reply, and the sheikh is willing to send it, but claims that the vali should express regret, and give compensation for damage done to property. Vali, however, will not even apologise, except on instructions from the f Porte. ^ As regards the general merits of the case, Cox and Wilson warmly traverse Crow’s views that the grievances are wholly on the side of the Turks, and contend that the troubles on the river were due to Turkish [? arbitrary] maladministration, as has been repeatedly admitted in despatches from His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah, and that order has been mainly maintained by sheikh out of deference to us. They therefore hope that His Majesty’s Government will not take a definite decision until the sheikh’s case is before them. Cox again urges that if we do not obtain suitable amendments from the vali “ our influence and sheikh’s own prestige will be damaged beyond repair.” He also says that a settlement of the question would be made easier if the vali of / Bussorah were detained at Bagdad. Cox is convinced that Turkish action against Mohammerah is preliminary to I activity as regards Koweit. * I am unwilling to express any opinion myself on the quarrel between the sheikh and the vali, as I am still awaiting sheikh’s case.

I have &amp;c., (Signed) G-erard Lowther. i His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Wo. 22. m ™ _ BASRA, April 23rd 1910 Sir:- As a result of the good understanding between the Vali of Basra and Sheikh Khazal of Hoharamerah the latter, some three months ago, promised to aid the Turkish Authorities to preserve the peace in this Vilayet and to hand over criminals from Turkish territory who sought refuge in the Sheikh’s domains. Khazal also undertook not to let disturbers of the peace cross the river to Turkey. Last month robbers attacked a house at Menawee, a village close to this Consulate. It was reported to the Authorities that one of the robbers was a servant of Mirza Hamza, the Sheikh’s agent at Basra, that he had fled to Mohammerah and that the Sheikh declined to give him up. On April 2nd Kassim Ghelmeran, proprietor of the local newspaper H Idhar el Hakk“ was killed by his labourers at Ajerawiye, a few miles below this Consulate on the opposite ^is Lxcellency The Right Honourable Sir Gr. Lowther, K.C.M.G., C.B. Etc,, See., &amp;c.side of the river in Turkish territory, and the murderers sought refuge at Mohanmerah. These people were not handed over to the Turkish Authorities. Besides these it is report ed that there are many criminals, fugitives from Justice, at Liohammerah and when Sheikh Khazal is asked to give them up he denies their presence there. Vue had similar grounds of complaint against the Authorities at Mohammerah in con nexion with the Maghil case and the murder of Mr. Glanville in 1906, as Your Excellency will see from the correspondence on the subject. Last month Mohammed Bey el Moshree applied to the Turkish Authorities in the usual way to remove certain fellahs from his property at Dowasir. The Authorities tried to carry out the orders given for their removal but without success and the trespassers w r ere supported in their opposition to the local authorities by one, iuiohamraed el dhinan, who with his followers lies at Zein on Turkish territory. The Vali sent the Tabour Agassi with lb gendarmes to arrest Mohammed el Chenan. This they were not able to do and were informed in answer to their de mandsdemands that all the people there belonged to Sheikh Khazal and were unable to come to Basra, and if the arrest was in sisted on, the Agent of Mohammed Bey el Mishree at Dowasir would be killed in the same manner as Kassim Chelmeran. The Tabour Agassi returned to Basra and informed the Vali ac cordingly. Mohammed Chinan seems to have applied to Sheikh Khazal for protection and when the latter was requested by the Vali to hand Chinan over, as he was an Ottoman subject residing on Turkish territory, the Sheikh refused to do so, contending that the man belonged to him. On April 18th however Sheikh Khazal brought up Mohammed Chinan with him in his yacht as a guest to Basra and wished to call on the Vali with him and discuss the affair. But the Vali refused to see either Khazal or Chinan and demanded that the latter should be handed over in the usual way and, if this were done, he would be pleased to receive the Sheikh. Sneikr* Khazal then returned to Mohammerah with his guest and rela- • / tions with Basra are somewhat strained in consequence. Mirza Hamza left shortly afterwards for Mohammerah. In conversation v/ith me the Vali saicx he nad no inten tion of giving way in the matter and, if the Sheikh did not concedeconcede his demands he would send the 'karmaris** to Zein which is Turkish territory to demonstrate and if necessary- pun ish Chenan and his retainers for their resistance to his demands. The Vali said he had had some opportunity of study ing Sheikh Khazal and thorough distrusted him. His influence was great as a land owner and a tribal chief on the Turkish side of the river and he thought most of the Mukhtars of the villages from Abulkhassib down were in his pay or pledged to his interests. He attributed all the river troubles from Basra to Fao to his sinister influence and, as a precaution, he had changed or was changing the local headmen, who were under the Sheikh’s influence, and was putting in his own men. He said the G-overnment now had means at its disposal of showing strength and he meant to take strong action. I have &amp;c., (Signed) F.E.

By order of the vali of Bussorah a Turkish gun-boat has already shelled and burned Bain, a village belonging to the sheikh, which lies on the Turkish bank of the river and is now threatening to bombard Failia, where the sheikh usually resides The sheikh has appealed to His Majesty’s Government, and as they have for a long time been a terms of amity with him, and are bound, by assurances given him in 1902, and subsequently renewed, to protect him against a naval attack by a foreign Power it may be necessary to dispatch a gun-boat to Mohammerah to prevent further violence against him. I ^ am accordingly to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad if the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty would give immediate orders that a gun-boat be held m readiness to start for Mohammerah if its presence there should be considered necessary. I am to add that His Majesty’s Government have instructed His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah and Mohammerah to endeavour to settle the matter locally by amicable means, and that they have addressed to the Ottoman Government', through His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, a strong protest against the proceedings of the vali of Bussorah, and an urgent request that orders may be sent to him to refrain from further acts of violence, and to second the efforts of His Majesty’s consuls to bring about a peaceful solution of the question at issue.

I HAVE the honour to report that last month the vali and the commodore proceeded in the “ Marmaris ” to Fao and met'Sheikh Mubarek and Sheikh Khazal at the house of Abdul Wahab-el-Kartass at Saraji, a few miles from Bussorah. The company were entertained at a banquet, at which the proceedings were enlivened by the Turkish band. After the meal Abdul Wahab, the host, made a speech, which has been reproduced in a local Arabic newspaper, the “ Izhar-el-Hakk.” The speaker, after congratulating the Ottoman nation on acquiring freedom and a constitution, said no people had ever done so without gradually progressing to the attainment of the highest happiness, glory, and prosperity, and he was convinced Turkey would do the same. He then declared that certain dishonest officials in the past, in order to serve their own ends, had succeeded in estranging Sheikh Mubarek Pasha, kaimakam of Koweit, from his country and his Government, and went on to eulogise the sheikh in the following terms :— “ Who is Sheikh Mubarek Pasha-es-Sabah ? He is the free, faithful, and zealous Ottoman now among us. Excellencies, we all know him well, and I need not detain you with an account of the sheikh or his family, whose generous qualities have gained notoriety from the books of Midhat Pasha, the founder of our freedom, while more recently the sheikh himself has become famous for the lavish manner in which he has contributed both money and assistance, as is attested by the official records of the Government.” The speaker concluded his address “ by attesting to the fact that, throughout the course of past events and vicissitudes, the sheikh has never wavered or changed in his allegiance and fidelity to the Ottoman Government and nation,” and ended by saying, “ long life to Sheikh Mubarek and our beloved neighbour, Sardar Arfa Khazal Khan, who, although a Persian by nationality, conducts himself like an Ottoman in his acts and contributes both efforts and money to the establishment of peace and good order in our dear native land, and that more especially in the time of the present vali. The party were then photographed, the vali in the middle, with Khazal on his right and Mubarek on his left, while the speaker, Kartass, stood in the foreground with his back to the camera. I called a few days ago on the author of the speech, Abdul Wahab-el-Kartass, who quite admitted that he had his tongue in his cheek when he delivered it. Mr. Lyle, of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie, and Co., who visited the sheikh at Koweit shortly after his trip to Bussorah, informed me that Mubarek had told him that the vali still refused to allow the registration of the transfer of the land he had purchased a t Fedaghie unless he took out a certificate of Ottoman nationality.

Cox still urges that Vali of Bussorah should be recalled. He points out that letter brought by Hadji Reis lays all the blame on sheikh, and by conditions it imposes lays on him responsibility for maintenance of harmonious relations in future ; but, on the other- hand, it offers no regret or reparation for shelling sheikh’s mother’s house, for death of his wife, or for damage to property estimated at 6001. Cox thinks that consul at Mohammerah will be able to induce sheikh, who is still absent, to accept conditions, and that modus vivendi will be thus restored. But if no reparation is offered satisfactory personal relations, between vali and sheikh cannot be resumed, while latter will feel that, although he has deferred to our pacific advice, he has gained nothing from us. I entirely concur with Cox that our influence with the sheikh will suffer if matters are left as they are, and mere expressions of regret 'would be inadequate in view of real grievances of the sheikh above mentioned.

Foreign Office, March 31, 1910. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, relative to the further assurances which the Sheikh of Mohammerah desires to receive from His Majesty’s Government. I am to inform you in reply that, in view of the considerations adduced by Viscount Morley, Sir E. Grey concurs in the view that the concession involved in the mention, in the communication to be made to the sheikh, of a definite period during which the assurances should hold good may be kept in reserve for the present. As regards the question of protecting the sheikh from foreign aggression, I am to state that the proposal to substitute for the form of words suggested in my letter of the 31st ultimo that made use of in the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Ameer of Afghanistan has received careful consideration in this department, in consultation with His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire. I am to state that the earlier formula was adopted, after long reflexion and exhaustive discussion of the question with Major Cox, because it appeared to be such as would convince the sheikh of the honest intention of His Majesty’s Government to do their best to safeguard him, as far as they possibly can, having regard to the state of local and general politics at the time, while not committing them in all circumstances to intervention by force of arms. Sheikh Khazal is, in Sir E. Grey’s belief, well aware that circumstances might arise in which it would be impracticable to give him effective help, and could easily be made to understand that the assurance, while constituting a pledge of the sincerity of the intention to afford him all the aid which His Majesty’s Government have it in their power to lend, is yet given with that qualification. Sir E. Grey is convinced that the form of words used in the agreement with the Ameer would fail to satisfy the sheikh, but, on the contrary, would rather tend to excite his apprehensions, and that, rather than offer it to him, it would be preferable to endeavour to avoid the question till it is again pressed by him. In view of the above considerations, in the cogency of which Major Cox entirely concurs, I am to express the hope that Lord Morley may see his way to withdraw. the objections which he has raised to the adoption of the formula proposed in my letter above referred to. In order, however, to remove all possibility of misunderstanding on the sheikh s part of the nature and scope of the assurances, Sir E. Grey would suggest that Major Cox should receive instructions, when communicating to his Excellency the assurances in writing, to convey to him at the same time a verbal intimation that, while His Majesty’s Government are perfectly sincere in their intentions towards him and have therefore given him these assurances, yet circumstances might arise in which it would ... ! i *. In such a case he would, be impossible for them to intervene by force on his behalf. . of course, receive the strongest diplomatic support. Major Cox would record in writing the substance of the conversation in the course of which this intimation was made to the sheikh. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.

Sir, India Office, February 16, 1910. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has given his careful attention to your letter No. 1006 of the 31st January, on the subject of the further assurances which the Sheikh of Mohammerah desires to receive from His Majesty’s Government, and I am to offer the following remarks upon the proposals made by Secretary Sir E. Grey : — 1. As regards the extension of the present assurances to the sheikh’s male descendants, I am to say that the proviso that they are only to hold good so long as his male descendants not only fulfil their obligations to His Majesty’s and the Persian Governments, but also are acceptable to the tribesmen, removes the objection which Viscount Morley would have felt to giving an unqualified dynastic pledge, and he approves the proposal accordingly. 2. On the point of the time limit, he is inclined to doubt the wisdom of departing from the present indefinite assurance, in view of the uncertainty of the future in the Persian Gulf; and he is confirmed in his doubt by the consideration urged in paragraph 15 of your letter read with head 2 of Major Cox’s memorandum, which explains the origin of the sheikh’s desire. He would accordingly suggest that this concession should be kept in reserve for the present. 3. Lord Morley is willing to submit the sheikh’s name to the King for the grant of an honorary K.C.I.E. on a suitable occasion, as to which Sir E. Grey will doubtless advise him. 4. On the question of protecting the sheikh against foreign aggression, his lordship observes that, though the extension of the assurance from naval defence^ to defence by land introduces no new principle, it is undoubtedly open to serious practical objections ; and he shares Sir E. Grey’s desire that His Majesty’s Government should not bind themselves to forcible intervention. He would suggest that the language of our agree ment with the Ameer might conveniently be followed, and that the assurance should run : “ His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to aid you to such extent and in such manner as may appear to them desirable in the event of an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power or encroachment,” &amp;c. In the longer form of assurance intended for the sheikh’s personal satisfaction, as well as in that to be shown to the tribesmen, it should be made very plain that this guarantee is conditional upon his being guided by our advice and maintaining an attitude satisfactory to us. 5. The other proposals seem to Lord Morley to be suitable ; but he would be glad if he might be allowed to see the draft assurances in their final form be foie instructions are sent to Sir George Barclay. I am, &amp;c. R RITCHIE. [2629 r—5]^ No. 16564.

The threatening language of the Turkish vali makes it imperative that you should at once see the Minister for Foreign Affairs and represent to him our most earnest hope that immediate orders be telegraphed to him to refrain from any further acts of violence against the sheikh. You should inform him that we instructed His Majesty’s consuls at Bussorah and Mohammerah to arrange matters amicably, but the aggressive character of the vali has apparently rendered these negotiations abortive. His intention to bombard Fail.ia and take action against Mohammerah, if carried out, will have the most serious results. The sheikh has already appealed to us, and I have given orders for a gun-boat to be in readiness to proceed to Mohammerah, if necessary, as Ills Majesty’s Government have long had relations of amity with the sheikh, and are bound to support him if attacked by a foreign Power. The matter should easily be capable of adjustment; and if the Turkish Government will send orders to the vali of the same nature as those which I have sent to His Majesty’s consuls, to the effect that the matter must be arranged locally, without further violence, the question need not be further discussed by the two Governments, but you should make it clear that these orders should be sent at once.f CONFIDENTIAL. { \Q\m vV Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling (Tehran).

Offences alleged by the Turkish authorities against the sheikh are that several murders and robberies have been committed at Bussorah, and that the offenders sought refuge at Mohammerah and the sheikh refused to surrender them as he had promised. An attempt was made to arrest one Mohamet Chenan, who is protected by the sheikh on the ground that he is the headman of tribe dependent on him, though the Turks claim him as an Ottoman subject, vali alleging that he obstructed and threatened Turkish soldiers sent to evict certain peasants from land [group omitted: ? belonging to] another proprietor near Zeitun, and ordering the attack on Zeitun, which is on the [group undecypherable] side of the Shat-el-Arab. Vali is at present at Bussorah, and His Majesty’s consul is endeavouring to arrange an amicable settlement through the intermediary of one Hadji Reis, who had satisfactory interview with the acting vali on 5th May. On 6th May His Majesty’s consul informed Hadji Reis that sheikh must refrain from creating trouble in the Bussorah vilayet, aid Turks to check crime, and realise that the Turkish wish for reform was genuine. His telegram continues : “ Turks may ask us for assurances on these points. Reis will see acting vali again to-morrow to learn the result of his telegraphic discussion with the vali.” Vali sent two letters to Persian consul-general at Bussorah on 26th April stating his grievance as against the sheikh, and saying that if Mohamet Chenan was not to be surrendered he would be obliged to include Mohammerah in area of pursuit. Matters are still further complicated by the death of the sheikh’s wife, who died from fright at Zeitun during the bombardment of the sheikh’s mother’s house, but Persians will not bring this forward.

I am. loath to authorise consul to do so without your instruc tions, but, should you approve, I think he shordd do so, onfy quite unofficially, so as not to commit His Majesty’s Government too far.

(Repeated to Tehran, No. 121.)Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 1, 12’30 p.m.) Tehran, May 1, 1910, 2*30 p.m. (No. 206.) MOHAMMERAH. Cox reports, on information of His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah, that on 25th April Turkish gun-boat shelled and burnt Zain village, belonging to Sheikh of Mohammerah, on Turkish bank of Shat-el-Arab, pretext being that the headman hod resisted arrest by Turkish soldiers on the ground of being Persian subject. Headman is one of tribal sheikhs who endorsed Sheikh of Mohammerah’s agreement with oil company. In spite of local excitement, Sheikh of Mohammerah, who was at Ahwaz, sent orders to his deputy to maintain calm attitude. Turks appear not to contemplate further action unless Sheikh of Mohammerah gives cause, in which case they might move against Failia or sheikh’s property at Bussorah. Failia is the sheikh’s ordinary residence, and, although west of the frontier line laid down by demarcation commission, is east of the locally recognised frontier. Cox understands that His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah is urging Sir G. Lowther that the Turks should be encouraged to carry question through by arbitr ary action. I entirely concur with Cox in very strongly deprecating this course, as it would make us appear to be supporting the Turks against Mohammerah, and would revive question of Turco-Persian frontier on Shat-el-Arab, which has been quiescent for so long. It might also involve question of precise application of assurances against naval attack given by Sir A. Hardinge to sheikh in 1902. X Present moment could scarcely be more inopportune. I would urge that the consuls at Mohammerah and Bussorah should attempt to promote amicable solution locally. ^ ''V</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00001a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/133</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00001a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/133</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 345/1908 Pt 2 'Mohammerah: situation.
