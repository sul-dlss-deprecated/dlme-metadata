No. 66517. No, 16^-15 -0., dated July 1916. From— Lieutenant-general Sir P. Lake , Commanding I. E. Force ' d'. To—The Chief of the General S f aff, Army Hea Iqmrters, Si nla. I have the honour to submit herewith General Towasheid's Despatches as received here by wireless, in instaiinents, during the m jnths of Mirch and April. 2. It will be observed that his narrative bre\ks off abruptly after the repeti tion of telegrams passing between himself, the Jorps rleadquarters and General Headquarters on IVIarcn 9th, 19 6. From that point onwards his report merely records his sense of the services rendered by troops and by individjal otBcers. I can only imagine that he intended to fill up tha e^ap in his nirrative later on but never did so; or perhaps that lie did complete it and that by accident that part was never sent to Kut. though various portions of the despatch were under trans mission right up to the date of the surrender of Knt. 3. Inquiries have been made, bnt I hive been unable to discover anything which throws further light on this point. 4. Obviously, I have not been able to refer this question and others ti General Townshend or to discuss his reco-n n^ndations with him. I therefore forward his report as received. 5. I would only add two remarks. In the first place, I cannot acquit General Townshend of a serious error of judgment in neglecting to acquaint either General Headquarters or the Oificer Commanding the relieving Column with the true state of his supolies. See page 5 of Report and Appendices f, U, W, Y, Z, BB.) A knowledge of how he stood in this respect was clearly a matter of the greatest importance to Ueneral Aylmer, who was pressing forward to his assistance under the impression that he was in urgent need of immediate relief, and who was doing so without waiting to complete the organisation and equipment of his force, as he would doubtless have done had he known that time would have permitted of it. 6. Secondly, i cannot but express the highest admiration of the manner in which General lownshend organised and carried out the defence of Kut The situation was not, in my opinion, a satisfactory one for defence, bu r . he prolonged its resistance to the utmost limit of human endurance, and so inspired the troops under him vith his spirit and determination that they seconded the efforts of their Commander in a manner worthy of the highest an d best traditions of the British and Indian Armies. 7. It has been found impossible in a great many cises to verify the names and numbers of the rank and file, as they were much mutilated in transmission. 1 he list, it will also be noticed is incomplete owing to communication with Kut having been cut off. S164GSB2 Copy to the Chief of the Im(»erial General Staff, War Office, London. No. is - jo - A ., dated Kut-al-Amarah, loth March 1916. Fron— Major-General, C. V. F. Townshend, C.B., D S.O., Commanding, 6th Indian Division, To— The General Officer Commanding, Indian Expeditionary Force 3 . I have the honour to send you my following report on the defence of Kut-al- Amarah:— I reached Kut with the 6th Division on the 3rd December I9&gt;6, as I report ed in my Ctesiphon despatch. I had retired some 90 miles or so from Ctesiphon with the Turkish Army on my heels. I had fought a severe action on the 1st December, and the troops were utterly exhausted, the Indian battalions being composed largely of recruits sent out in drafts from India to fill up the vacancies in my ranks after the battle of Kut-al Amarah, last September. It was absolutely necessary for these reasons to halt and let the men have rest and food. And strategical reasons demanded that the advance ol large Turkish forces should be checked firmly, unless we wanted them to o\er run the Tigris valley as far as Am-irah, and to give time for reinforcements now arriving at Basrah from Egypt and France to ascend the river and concentrate a^ Amarah io stop the Turkish ad\ance. Thus by halting and digging myself in at Kut, where I may mention no fortifications or entrenchments existed whatever with the exception of a sa\age warfare fort and some blockhouses also suitable only for uncivilised warfare, should give to Sir John Nixon time to concentrate and give him liberty of action and manoeuvre and so constitate myself a ' force de couvertur e so to speak, I knew well the usual fate of a force in history which deliberately shuts itself up in an entrenched camp as Bazaine did in the Metz entrenched camp, but I considered the advantage of holding in check the advancing hostile forces both strategically and politically demanded that I should run a risk of not being relieved. I accordingly wired to the Army Commander at Basrah as follows 'No. 95.G., 4th December 1915. I am making Kut into as strong an entrenched camp as possib'e in the given time. The enemy's advanced guard is now some ten miles off, and the main body some five miles beyond that. As it is reported that Von Dei- Goltz is at Baghdad now commanding the enemys' army of six divisions I shall expect him to turn this place, putting off a force of observa tion at Kut. The relieving force will probably have to fight another battle at Es Sinn. I have shut myself up reckoning with certainty on being relieved by large forces arriving at Basrah. 1 he state of extreme exhaustion of the men demanded instant rest. I was very anxious and it looked at one time on December 2nd as if whole Division would lie down and not be able to move. Our being here will also delay Von Der Goltz s advance down the Tigris and give more time for you to concentrate rel eving force on the Amarah— Ali-al-Gharbi line. It is only violation of principle of economy of force if you send up reinforcements in driblets, of which Von Der Goltz would take instant advan tage.' Proclaiming to the troops I informed them that I intended to stand fast and hold Kut; that the honour of our country and whole Empire demanded we should hold up the Turks here. The troops were so weary that digging work could not begin seriously till the 5th December. They needed rest and, above all, food, and in this way I was prevented from making a fortified bridge-head of three redoubts for covering a bridge in case I wished to debouch on the right bark.The Major General, General Staff, had wired to the General Officer Commanding, Kut, (Brigadier General Rimington, R.G ), on the 2iid December in his No. 1008-98 -O: — 'Please tell Townshend that Army Commander mist leave situation to him as to how fir he fails back. Bat Army Co n nander's inten tion is to concentrate reinforcements as far forward as possible.^ The Army Commander approved of mv action in stmlin* fast at Kut-al- Amarah in the following telegram from Major-General, General Staff : — ' No. 1008 105 O , 3rd December 19' 5* Army Commander is glad to hear of your decision and is convinced that your troops will continue to show the same spirit in the defence as they have shown throughout your operations. ■Reinforcements will be pushed up to you with every possible speed.' On the 4th December, my field state showed 10,398 combatants of which 7,500 only were infantry. It shows how weak the infantry units were especially the British battalions; the infantry element which had borne the brunt of the fighting was very weak, the divisional troops being numerous. A cavalry btigade wasincluded in the 10,398 combatants and the 30th Brigade of the 12th Division was still attached to my division. I had roughly 800 rounds per rifle, and gun ammunition as follows was in the magazine at Kut:— No. of guns. Description of ammunition. No. of round s Rounds per gun. '9 18 -pr. Shrapnel I 1 ,200 590 2 13 -pr.

S. Delamain, C.B., D.S.O , 16th Infantry Brigade. North-eastern B.igadier-General F. A. Hoghton, 17th Infantry Brigade.

Divisional Artillery. —Concentrated principally at Brick Kilns. • (Not recetved).4 4 Thft defence consisted of three lines of defences. (1) Main line of defence—along line of fort and existing blockhouses. (2) Middle line of defence, and (3) Second line of defence {vide map attached).* The Divisional Kngineer Commander v\as ordered to give me a list of all engineering stores in Kut as soon as possible, including what remained of bridg ing material after the retreat. A list of all supplies had to be furnished to me, including those available in the town, which would be co:nmandeered if necessary; also list of ammunition at Kut. I ordered ammunition and supplies to be stored in different magazines and distributed in various pla'ces. The old Turkish bridge of boats was to be brought down to be thrown across to the south of Kut town and a strong bridgehead of three redoubts instal led on the right bank to protect bridge and cover my debouch on to right bank if necessary {vide projected bridge map attached).f I gave orders for the Arabs in the town who were not householders to be turned out with the exception of those the Military Governor of Kut might re commend to me, twenty of the principal Arab inhabitants being handed over to me as hostages for the good behaviour of the rest I arranged for a strong force of military police to be organised in the town ; also a fire brigade. All transport carts not in actual use were to be parked in a place selected by the Assistant Quartermaster-General and all drivers and followers not actually employed to be put on to grinding grain in hand mills. Heads of Depirtments had to send in reports as to their wants and the means at hand for supplying them. The General Staff Officer (1), the Divisional Engineer Commander and the Brigadier General Roya^ Artillery were to study the weak parts of the lines of defence and endeavour to rectify them. Provision of bomb-proof cover for houses had to be gone into by the Divisional Engineer Commander. Civil population was to furnish labour for work in • trenches, roads, etc. Good build ings for hospitals had to be selected. Communication telephones were to con nect the different sectors of defence and Divisional Headquarters Passages were to be cut through town as shon cuts. The town would be used as a redoubt or keep which can be defended step by step if necessary. Although I have seen it stated in the press that I had fallen back on to the strongly fortified position of Kut, I wish here to make the truth perfectly clear that Kut was absolutely without defences, not a single trench was dug The so-called fort is merely a walled enclosure evidently for use against an un- civilised enemy without guns. The hostile artillery easily made breaches in the walls which, when filled up with earth and sandbags, made the ' fort when entrenchments inside were added, into a formidable redoubt. The fact of the existing fort ' and chain of so-called blockhouses was a great drawback to me for it forced me to occupy this line causing my posuion to be over extended. The blockhouses I had quickly to have levelled as they were eminently con venient for the enem/ , guns to range on. For two days, vh.\ the 3rd and 4th December, the troops were too exhaust ed from the retreat to do any work and all the entrenchments and redoubts had to be dug and thrown up under fire. Had Kut been fortified when I arrived 1 should have had time to establish not only a proper bridge—but also to make a fortified bridge head on the right bank and in this way conducted a far more offensive defence. As it was I was pinned down to the passive defensive owing to Kut being unfortified. •Not received, t No map received. *5 There were plenty of supplies, zis For British troops For Indian troops Fuel 60 days. 60 „ 21 „ and 33 days across river in Liquorice Factory. Grain Fodder 30 „ 4 n Biscuits Flour Atta supplies 40 »» 67 In the town of Kut there was easily enough food for the population—some 5,oco to 6,000 householders—to last some 3 months, but the Military Governor was authorised to buy up all grain and sell to thelo^ver classes at cheap rates. My scheme for the defence of Kut was to hold each avenue of approach, or sector, with a minimum force sufficient to guarantee holding its own whilst 1 kept a centnl mass, or general reserve, in my hand ready to throw into the fight on any particular sector attacked, in other words on the interior line princi ple of action. On the 5th December the Army Commander wired that every effort would be made to relieve me as soon as possible, and it was hoped to do so within two months. This had not been bargained for and I accordingly telegraphed back as follows:— ' No. 160-G., 6th December 1915. In reply to your No. 100S-109-O. f have carefully considered your statement of relief within two months 41 and am convinced that that would mean loss of this Division, for *'the whole Turkish force of six divisions would debouch before *' then. It would be best I think that I should preserve force by 'retiring to Ali-al-Gharbi and form covering force to the concen- ' iration at Amarah. To be relieved within a month only would ' mean a very anxious and trying time but two months I am certain means the loss of this division. My retirement from here should 41 be arranged as soon as possible. I should save most of ammu- ' nition, utilizing mahelas, and bring away heavy guns. You know the ' size and shape of the Kut peninsula I occupy. A large force can ' enfilade peninsula from all points of the compass and render it ' an inferno '. Loss of the division would mean not only a great loss and a dangerous loss of prestige in Mesopotamia but in India itself the effect would be most disas trous, I further asked if there was any news of a Russian advance on Baghdad as it would make all the difference in my situation here. If a Russian force moved on Baghdad it would compel Von Der Goltz to direct all his energies on the defence of Baghdad, and I should know that I was dealing with a hostile minimum force only of approximately my own strength or little more. By the night of the 6th December, the bridge composed of the remnants of our bridge train, and the whole Turkish bridge of boats brought upstream from below the fort (see Map),* was thrown across, and I sent the Cavalry Brigade and ' S ' Battery, R. H. A., across to right bank in order that they should not be shut up with us but join the reinforcements at Ali-al-Gharbi. It crossed safely accompanied by its own transport and disappeared in the direction of Shaikh Saad followed up by fully i,oco Arab horsemen. I had already sent down all shipping, gunboats, and all spare transport I could send in order to facilitate the advance of the relief force and save mouths to feed at Kut. S164GSB •No neap received.6 The following telegram from he Army Commander, received on 6ih December by me, to the troops :— ' I am delighted to send you this just received from Chief India. u Please convey to General Townshend and all under his com- ' mand my appreciation of the skill and gallantry displayed in ' their admirably conducted retirement on Kut-al-Amarah in face ' of greatly superior numbers. Ends*' At the request of the Flight Commander I allowed the aeroplanes to go down to Ali-al-Gharbi, as he explained to me that once we were invested the hostile guns would fire upon our aeroplanes rising from the ground and also destroy them at rest. I required of him constant aerial observations as to the enemy's movements down river as I expected him to occupy his former position of last September at Es Sinn, and also observation up river towards Aziziyah with remaining reinforcements arriving from Baghdad. He said this would be done. Only four visits up to the icth January have been paid to us by the aeroplanes from Ali-al-Gharbi notwithstanding my repeated request. At 6 p.m. on the 6th December I received the following reply from the Army Commander :— •« No. 1008-117-O., 6th December. Reply to 160,163 and 169 G. of 8th ' pirst point. The period of two months was an outside limit M calculating to the arrival of the last reinforcement and the time ' that would elapse before a general forward movement could be ' made. It is hoped to quicken this up. Second point. So far ' as we know you are not yet invested nor is the river c ^* 11 Younghusband with 28th Brigade and Cavalry Brigade should •« be established at Ali-al-Gharbi and Shaikh Saad within the next ' W eek and enable supplies being pushed into you. 3rd point. '* Retirement from K.ut would open the Shatt-al Hai to Turks and • • have very bad effect and does not at present seem to be demand- ' ed as a military necessity. Of the actual dispositions for oc- ** cupation of Kut you are the best judge So far the Turks have 'apparently made no move. Do you think possibly that they *' have shot their bolt for the time ? They have only five steamers ' as against our three times that number and more coming. You ' have some 10 ,000 against 12 ,000 and you have superior artillery. M 4th point. You speak of six divisions. Does this number ' include 52nd last reported to be in Baghdad and 26th rumoured ' to be at or near Felujah but not in any way confirmed ? On 5th ' instant in your 1. G.-109 you spoke of only three divisions 14 in front of you. You should send aeroplane reconnaissance ' to see what is going on at Bedrah. 5th point. Retirement ' from Kut should only be resorted to as a last extreme. In any ' case the Sinn position seems indicated not Ali-al-Gharbi where ' you will be on top of Younghusband. Russians on 4th December 11 were reported three marches from Hamadan and 23 from Bagh- «• dad, and Army Commander is again wiring C. G. S. to expedite ' their advance. It may be possible enemy wishes merely to con- ' tain you whilst concentrating against Nasiriyah. Have you con- ' sidered this ? We are reinforcing Nasiriyah at once to provide ' against this contingency. 6th point. Remember that our ' large reinforcements arriving daily will have good moral effect ' throughout the Basrah Vilayet and Army Commander has asked *• for another division and more heavy guns. As long as you ' remain at Kut enemy is in ignorance of your plan and you are ' fulfilling duties of a detachment by holding up superior numbers. 11 7th pomt. Your 169-G. just received. The concentration at ' Shaikh Saad and Ali-al-Gharbi will be carried out. Taking all *' these points into consideration Army Commander docs not 11 approve your proposal to fall back on Ali-al-Gharbi,7 On the 7th December I sent the following telegram in answer to the above :— f ' No. 194-G, 7th December 1915. That Younghusband with 2Sth ''Brigade and Cavalry Brigade shall be at Shaikh Saad and Ali- ' al-Gharbi within the next week is what 1 asked tor in my 169-G. ' I am glad you can do it as it alters altogether my situation ' here. All the reasons you give that I should remain at Kat were ' fully considered by me before I decided to shut myself up in Kut 41 knowing well by history the fate that generally awaits any force ' in fortress or entrenched camp which shuts itself up. It was ' your stating you hoped to relieve me within two months which ' made my situation critical. Your placing Younghusband s ' command and cavalry at Shaikh Saad altogether alters matters. ' We may have enemy commence their attack on us directly. 41 The cavalry brigade left and are encamped close this night on ' my northern front. The enemy commenced their operations directly our cavalry were observed to have crossed and marched down river. Troops advanced in extended order against our northern front and dug trenches with the extraordinary rapidity of the Turks in such work. Working like moles night and day their investing lines in a few days formed a net-work of trenches and communication ways cast round our northern front from the left bank of the Tigris above the top of Kut to the left bank of the Tigris and the town of Kut, entirely closing up the neck of the bottle so to speak. At the same time a force estimated by me at a division moved on the right bank from west to east crossing the Shatt-al Hai five miles south of the town of Kut and then approached Kut on its eastern flank on the right bank of the river in order to block our retreat down river by right bank of the river. The next three or four days the enemy placed guns round us on both banks of the river, north-east, north, north-west, west, south and east and south-east. As a chief disadvantage of an entrenched camp like the one shaped like the Great India Peninsula with water on all sides except on the north side, which was our land frontier so to speak, was that the fire of our guns went from the centre to the circumference and so it was divergent and hence disseminated, while that of the enemy was directed from the circumference to the centre, and thus had maximum effect. I issued an appeal to the honour and devotion of the troops, on the 4th December, saying that our duty was to hold Kut-al-Amarah and allow rein forcements to concentrate near at hand for our relief and I have endeavoured by all means to keep up the morale of the men and installed in their minds approaching success from without. The departure of the cavalry brigade had now reduced my numbers of combatants to 8,990 of which the infantry mustered some 7,000. Want of British officers, owing to casualties in Indian units, is most dangerous and serious factor in defence of Kut. I can say without exaggera tion that this loss in British regular officers in Indian units endangered the defence, for the few Indian Army Reserve Officers generally speaking were untrained and thus could not keep men in hand as much as was desirable. The unit had lost heavily in Indian officers and the Indian battalions as a result have become practically armed bands, with discipline it is true, but nothing more nor less than armed bands from want of British officers. Had the system of Indian service in having a full complement of British officers with regiments on the scale of British line regiments been prevalent to-day, I should never have had the least doubt in my mind as to result of any occurrence whatever. The enemy's guns violently shelled the fort the whole afternoon. There were 30 casualties in the fort, whose walls crumbled under the common shells. The fort had evidently been designed only for protection of Kut against Arab tribesmen. On the 7th December a letter was sent by Nur-ed-Din, the General-in- Chief of the Fuiks, who asked me to lay down my arms to avoid useless bloodshed, pointing out that my troops were weak in numbers and enfeebled, and it only needed a serious effort with his superior numbers to overwhelm us8 He complained also that my occupying the town of Kut and so exposing peaceful inhabitants to the horrors of war was against the laws of civjlised warfare. I sent reply saying that as to my laying down my arms I had no reply to such an absurd demand, but thanked him for his courtesy in conforming to the usual custom in war as regards its being usual before bombarding a place to summon the Commandant or Governor to surrender. I observed that he was curiously and extraordinarily in error to imagine that the defence of a town was against the laws of civilised war ; that there was no battle of any consequence in Europe or siege which did not include the attack or defence of towns or villages : that his friends, the Germans, not only always occupied towns and villages but did other things to the inhabitants peculiar alone to the Germans and in a manner particularly T eutonic. On the 8th January, I heard the news that the cavalry brigade had safely arrived at Ali-al-Gharbi on the afternoon of the 8th December and that General Avlmer was to leave Basrah on 9th December to command the troops on the Tigris River formed into an Army Corps. The cavalry brigade had been attacked after smarting from Kat by Robia Arabs and Ajil with 8oo horsemen. Practically every Arab was hostile till they reached Butomeid. On the 9th December, we were severely shelled from all points of the com pass. The detachment covering the bridge-head, lightly entrenched on the right bank close to the bridge, having left their entrenchments to drive the enemy's riflemen off some sandhills, were counter-attacked and driven across the bridge. This, detachment consisted of a double company of the 67th Punjabis under Captain Gribbon who was shot in three places and left behind unable to be carried away owing to heavy fire and was killed as has since been ascertained. The enemy on the right bank utilised the banks and water-cut and fired on our bridge of boats. As there was a danger of the enemy forcing a way across the bridge in the night I ordered it to be destroyed in the night by explosives. The bridge was successfully demolished on the night of the gth-loth December by Lieutenant Sweet of the 7th Gurkhas and Lieutenant Matthews, K. E. and a number of volunteers consisting of Gurkhas and Sappers and Miners, and was a most gallant affair, the two officers going across the bridge to the enemy's side of the river (the bridge in places had sagged under the swift running current owing to water-logged pontoons or dannaks) and laying the saucissson, the others stood by to cut the anchor cables. With the explosion the bridge broke up. The enemy were for some time too dazed to open fire and the whole party escaped. I have recommended the two British officers for the Victoria Cross and the men for the Indian Order of Merit. The enemy pressed us severely all day on the loth December along the northern front and the fort, and were only kept back by our heavy rifle fire. We were heavily bombarded on December 11 th, our casualties being 202 killed and wounded. The enemy, we suppose, lost heavily from the dead bodies we could see lying in the open. The attack was repeated on the 12th December at 6-30 P.M. For nearly an hour a tremendous rifle fire from the enemy was answered by our troops in the first line along the northern front. The enemy did not push the attack home and the fire ceased about 7-30 P.M. We have smce ascertained from prisoners and deserters that the enemy lost heavily ; they were thickly massed for attack just before dusk. Our post at the Liquorice Factory and village on the right bank was also the object of a very heavy rifle fire fight, but the enemy did not push home, not leaving their trenches. These heavy attacks, both on the northern front and on the Liquorice Factory and village, were repeated at dawn. On the 1 3th and 14th December, the enemy's guns remained silent and it was thought that they must be saving ammunition after the fierce bombardment of 10th and 11th December in which we reckon they must have fired at least 5,000 rounds of-shelis, and we know that they had suffered severe losses in the attack of 12th December at 6-30 P.M.— Arabs and deserters say fully 2,000. Our casualties on the 13th were 122. I estimated the strength of the enemy's forces besieging me on 14th Decem ber to be roughly 12,000 men and about 33 guns in position around me. Enemy had now apparently given up all idea of a direct attack without re course to siege operations and was now conducting regular siege operations.9 Opposite our north-west sector, there was now a complete net-work of lines of investing entrenchments with communication ways ; the enemy worked everlastingly by day and night like moles with astonishing rapidity. Our troops had by now quite good communication ways and entrenchments in all directions necessary, as will be seen in the attached map,* and the morale of the Indian troops continued daily to im- •Not received. prove. They had been shaken by the exhausting march in retreat and subsequent want of sleep and rest at Kut owing to the necessity of digging in and digging deep with utmost speed. The enemy's snipers were persistent, enterprising and of tireless energy, and I had a sniping detachment formed under Major Booth of the Army Corps Signal Company which has worked most effectively. I had directed w^rk since December icth to December 16th, I see in my diary, with a view to : — (1) Improving communications from main line defence to second line. (2) Improving throughout second line defence. (3) Improving defences of the town on west, southern and south-east fronts. Lowness of water in river rendered me uneasy on south front and it appear ed to me to be possible for the enemy to wade across shoals and banks under cover of darkness, and I watched east and south-east fronts accordingly with piquets. The 17th Brigade remained permanently installed at fort and north-east section ; the 16th and 30th Brigades alternatively relieved each other as garrison of north-west section, the brigade relieved taking its place in second line defence (available for support of north-west section or north-east section as the case might be). The 18th Brigade supplied garrison of Liquorice Factory village on right bank (communication by ferry under cover of darkness), x.e, two batta'ions with two battalions in Kut town, one of which was installed in fort and south- cast edge of town. Arab inhabitants of town caused me much anxiety. I knew of course they were in communication with the enemy, but how, it was not possible to say, and my anxiety was based on fact that there must be many rifles buried and conceal ed and it was certain if the enemy should induce them to rise in the night when an attack was in progress on our northern front that the consequences might be serious. It was for that reason I had taken hostages and announced I would shoot them if there was the least sign of treachery. At the commencement of the siege I caused twelve Arabs caught looting to be tried by military commission and shot ' pour encourager les autres.' I had intended turning all the Arabs out of town when I arrived at Kut but on the inter cession of Sir Percy Cox and the Military Governor who pointed out that the women and children would suffer hardships, I allowed bona fids householders to remain and turned out all other Arabs from the town. The town was patrolled at night. About 16th and 17th December, apathy of enemy was very pronounced and this I ascribed to their losses and consequent discouragement, but I reckoned that the expected 52nd Division, which should have finished its concentration at Baghdad about now, might be arriving soon. On night 17th-18th December, two small sorties were made by the Officer Commanding fort—Colonel Brown of the 103rd Mahratta Lighi Infantry-—in which two parties, mixed British soldiers of the Oxfords and Indian soldbrs, cleared enemy's trenches close to the fort bayonettljig some 30 Turks and taking several prisoners ; our loss was one man slightlv wounded. I believe in a few small sorties well directed; they strike terror into the enemy ; to execute many, where our troops have always to finally fall back, only lowers the morale of our troops. It was evident now that the fort at the north-east of our front was the enemy's main objective ; his artillery constantly shelled it and large breaches SI64GSB yIO • were made and parts of the wall fell in, but as a matter of fact it only in creased the strength of that post for our garrison there constantly retrenched and blocked up the breaches with sandbags-—in fact the so-called fort has be come a very strong high commanding redoubt. At 5-30 A .m ., the enemy opened a heavy gun and rifle fire on the fort, and cheering and bugling could bs heard from the eneny's troops massed in their trenches close to the fort, but their assault did not materialise under the steady fire of our troops. In view of the arrival of relieving force and for other obvious reasons I had endeavoured to find a place for throwing a bridge secretly and rapidly across the Tigris at south or south-west edge towards north of Kut, but though we have roughly fifty mahelis here with mists the Divisional Engineer Commander, whom I consulted in the matter, declares it is impossible owing to want of road way planks woodwork, and the piles will not hold in the swift running current and slimy ooze-like mud forming the bed of the river ; there was no way of mak ing a bridge besides except under fire. In reply to enquiries from Corps Commander I said th^t it would hie better to relieve me by left bank roads ; I could then join hands, and that I had no means of crossing to right bank except by means of a and steam launch, 1 could not commence crossing until arrival of relief force, f or no shelter exists from enemy's guns for rafts, etc., being made. My means of crossing are two tows only, ' Samana ' and one launch, two barges—one undecked,—and about 50 ma^ (unmanageable in the current). The Assistant Quartermaster-General, the Divisional Engineer Commander and the Marine Transport Officer had work ed this out as nine days required for my crossing my force. At a rate of 700 men crossed at a time it would take quite two hours for embarking, disembarking and return, thus, 20 hours are required to get 7,000 infantry over. ?or animals and officers chargers and maxim gun mules (3,003 animals), and at 3 hours a trip, it would require 25 trips or 75 hojrs. Guns, say 3 field batteries at 4 hours a trip, require 5 trips or 20 hours. Field Ambulances, say 3 trips at 2 hours a trip, take six hours. Transport carts (309) means 5 tiips at 3 hours making 15 hours. Total equals 9 days and 3 days must be added for stores and rations. I daresay all this could be reduced to 6 days by working ceaselessly day and night; but I suppose Army Commander will surely bring up his own bridge. On the 24th December a very heavy rifle fire supported by artillery was opened on the Liquorice Factory and village at 5-15 A .M. continuing till 8-30 A M., but the enemy made no assault. Their trenches were no more than 200 yards from the village entrenchments. The fort had been the scene of another fierce fight on the night of the 23rd- 24th, also there were determined efforts on the part of the Turks to cut the wire entanglements. Several dead lay on the wires in the morning. On the forenoon of the 24th December the fort was heavily shelled ; large breaches were made in the walls and at 12-30 P.M. the garrison had to retire from the first line of defence in the fort and the enemy ejected a lodgment, but were driven out in their turn leaving about 100 dead bodies in the north-east. The garrison of the fort was reinforced by the Oxfords now mustering only some 200 rifles. Bombardment of the fort recommenced and was kept up constantly. From the appearance of the enemy's main camp up river and from the un usual boldness of the Turks in attacking in the open in to-day's attack on the fort, I was certain that they must have received reinforcements and fresh troops whose morale had not been shaken at Ctesiphon or on 1st December at Umm-al- Tubul. At dark, about 200 bodies could be seen outside the fort and massing of troops in the rear trenches could be observed indicating a new attack on the fort. About mid day, a 12 centimetre shell swept top of house I used as my observation post (roof of Divisional Headquarters house) killing Captain Begg,11 Royal Artillery and wounding Lieutenant-Colonel Courtenay, Royal Garrison Artillery, acting as Commanding Royal Artillery (since died of wounds) and his Staff Officer—Captain Garnett, Royal Field Artillery (dead). On the night of 24th December and Christmas Day a furious attack was made on the fort and at about 2 A.M. on Christmas morning the Turks forced their way again into the north-east bastion of the fort. I sent 200 of the 48th Pioneers to reinforce the fort garrison which stood grimly to their posts and after regular bludgeon work (it might be called where men were throwing grenades at each other at 10 yards' range) the Tuiks were forced to retire again out of the fort into their trenches. Their loss was estimated by us at 800 to 1,000, but it has since been ascertained by evidence given by Turkish medical officers taken prisoners at Shaikh Saad that fully 2000 were killed and wounded. I took Norfolk Regiment away from the 18th Brigade to reinforce the fort garrison. We lost 315 killed and wounded including 17 officers at the fort. The defence of the fort was very fine and Lieutenant-Colonel Brown of the 193rd. Mahratta Light Infantry, who commanded the garrison, deserves great credit for the conduct of defence. Casualties elsewhere than the fo r t 67, total 382 on Christmas Day. Our casualties during siege from the 4th December inclusive to 25ih December now number 1625. The rest of the day on Christmas Day after the Turkish assault had been repulsed was absolutely peaceful. The garrison of the fort were busy retrenching and making the fort much stronger and I turned my attention to strengthening my second line of defences. Turkish prisoners taken at the fort said that Von Der Goltz had visited Kut and returned again by steamer to Baghdad. One said that he had previously arrived at Baghdad on 10th December as he was one of the Guard of Honour at the railway station. On the 26th December, we saw two large columns (I estimated them at two divisions) cross from the left bank to the right bank at the Shumran Bend, where the enemy undoubtedly have a bridge, and large camps were pitched on the right bank about 7 or 8 miles west of Kut which combined with the move of much transport westward at the same time gave the impression th it the enemy was commencing a retirement, but it soon become apparent that the enemy was dividing his forces placing a part of it on the right bank. Two sepoys—one in the 22nd Punjabis and one in the 65th Punjabis—deser ted to the enemy on 27th-28th December, both being fired on but not, unfortu nately, being hit. On the 29th December the enemy sent in a flag of truce to the fort asking for permission to bury the dead. As the letter was addressed to me by the Officer Commanding of a Turkish regiment in the vicinity of the fort I sent back to say I would grant an armistice of 4 hours to bury the dead if the Turkish General-in-Chief wrote asking me to do so; that I could not grant an armistice unless the Turkish supreme Commander himself asked for it. There would have to be a neutral zone, I said, into which small parties, unarmed, from either side could go and that if the Turks used the flag of truce as a cloak to get troops up into the forward trenches as they had dono on a similar occasion at Gallipoli, i should open fire with all my guns at once No answer was received to this communication for 2 or 3 days. I also wrote a letter to Nur ed-Din Pasha in French asking what had happened to Captain Gribbon who had fallen into their hands severely wounded on the day of the fight on the right bank near the bridge head-. On the 29th December, also I telegraphed to Corps Commander that it was reported that 36th Division was following the 5th Composite Division (already here) and was supposed to be concentrated at Baghdad by the 21st December. 1 pointed out we had quite sufficient strain on us already and that I felt certai i12 he did not require reasons from me to show why I was a '* ,ous d b h d more reinforcements reachmg enemy. I hoped that .f lle sta ' ted ^ ^ January from Ali-al-Gharbi, as 1 understood he would do hat he c0 ' ld | e , ° Kut much sooner than loth |anuary, as Ah-al-Gharbi ib only some 5p miles distanT I asked for news as to how and what -'jt^H^aTnewsZ t wa's river. The strain of not knowing was great, and I a ® ked ' S '' C culated of the Russians. In arswer to enquiries by the Corps Commander It l should have no more than S coo rifles fit to co-operate ~ der 0 Coros when it arrived, and this would include some 5foo Sappers and Miners. 1 should have three batteries of Royal Field Artillery of four guns each but with carryin' capacity (wagons) reduced 50 per cent, one howitzer battery of four guns two naval 4-7' guns in horse boats, Divisional Ammunition Column reduced p' r cent normal ; Assistant Director Medical Services calculates some 2 .ooo wounded and sick will have to be sent down at once. One division of enemy was seen going eastward towards Es-Sinn on left bank on evening of December zSth, also transport column on December 29U1 by the same road. Enemy now turned their attention to shelling Divisional Headquarters in the town every day, as our whereabouts had evidently become known to them, and several very close shaves were experienced—roof and upstairs rooms being frequently swept ; several men in hospital were killed by shells bursting amongst wounded in that place. Corps Commander informed me on 29th December that roughly two Divisions with brigade of cava'ry composed the relieving force and he asked me for deta ed description of entrenchments around me which 1 tarnished. General Headquarters said no news of Russian movements in Persia, from which I gathered that they were certainly not making any serious movemen on Baghdad, or they would have moved with their forces united en b^oc on Kermanshah and Kasr-i-Shirin ; instead of this their force was disseminated in several columns travelling Persia in order to occupy several important points in country as one would do in permanent occupation, and 1 felt sure that \on der Goltz, if he is directing Turkish strategical plans or projects in this field operations, will read it in the same way. The enem&gt;'s snipers had now turned their attention to shooting women and children of the town who go to the river in the evening to draw water. 1 he Arabs in the pay of the Turks are using also hollow bullets of the fashion and calibre of the Snidtr bullet and several of our people have been horribly wounded inconsequence. Two or three bundles of seditious documents in Hindi, Nagn Sindhi 41 Eande Mataram ', were discovered left against our wre entanglements calling on the Indian troops to rise and murder the British otneers and join their brothers, tl e Turks, who would pay them better and give them grants o[ land. Following is copy of Corps Commander's telegram giving h;s projects for the relief of Kut :— ' No. n-ioS-G., dated 30th December 1915. In reply to No. 69 40 G. ot December 29th. You will readily realise that in drawing up an appreciation of our advance to relieve Kut it was necessary to give safe dates of arrival at Kut allowing for opposition en route Our relieving force can only be organised as it arrives at Ah-al- Gharbi and dates of starting from there allowed for this. 1 hose dates also depend on arrival of ships from Basrah. Objections to pushing forward troops prematurely from Ali-al-Gharbi for your relief and using forced marches, but I am of course ready to take very great risks in this matter should your condition abso lutely require it. For example, I could, in a very extreme case start advance of a column from Ah al-Gharbi on January 1st. Such a column if there was no opposition could possibly reach Nakhailat on 3rd and by sending troops after them on ships without stopping at Ali-al-Gharbi they might possibly amount to a division there on that date. I cannot of course say what enemywould do under such circumstances. We might have to fight then at Es-Sinn position, and this seems probable, vide your 69-44-0. of 29th, but even in that case the pressure on you would be greatly relieved If enemy did not stand between Nakhailat and Kut such a column could join you at Kut on 4th. Remainder of Corps could not possibly reach Nakhailat till 8th and Kut till 9th. I would greatly prefer to make a start from Ali-aU Gharbi with one division on 3rd as proposed in my No 11-38-G. of 2()th. In such a case if your condition demanded it, one division could be at Nakhailat on 5th and the rest of Corps on 8th. By far the best plan, however, irom the point of viev of relieving force would be to alvance all together fro n Shaikh Saad or its vicinity as a combined C jrp-i. Nak'iailat could possibly be reached on 8th, though 9th would be safer da^e. Such a plan though slower would be far more certain to gain its object. It is essential t) postpone our actual methodical advance as long as possible as hurry means inevitablv want of organisation and consequently decreased efficiency. You may, however, rest assured that everything; possible will be done to hurry relief to utmost if your circumstances really demand it. I know you give full weight to such considerations before you give any definite dale by which you must be relieved. Addressed 6th Division, repeated General Headquarters. 0 1 January 1st, 1916, a sepoy of the 103rd Vfnhratta Light Infantry who was on sentry duty fired two shots at the Indian officer and jumping the trench at the fort tried to escape to enemy. He was tried by Summary General Court Martial, condemned to death and shot. 1 replied to Corps Commander's project of relief contained in his No. 13- lo8-G. of December 30th, to sav I natu ally agreed with his intention and desire to unite his force before finally moving forward to relieve me, on the principle of economy of force, that 1 would only appeal for immediate help from advanced guard of d'vision of YounghusOand in direst necessity, t he necessity I hoped would no arise since enemy was clearly worried and anxious regarding advance, dimension of relief force and had n iw turned his siege practically into a blockade investment confining his chief activity to shelling us at night with his heavy guns. On the 1st January, a hostile aeroplane passed over us going eastward and was seen to return and alight in the enemy's camp. On the 2nd January, the enemy shelled the town vigorously with 18 g 1 1 S —heaw guns as well as quick-firers. A Turkish corporal deserted to us and informed us that a new division had arrived in the past two or three days. On the 3rd January, large bodies of the enemy's troops—3stimUed at two divisions at least —moved eastward from the main F irkisticamp and I thought at first it was to attack the fort but it proved afterwards they were bound dovn river by the left bank to oppose the relieving force. And on this date also I came to the conclusion that the bulk of the enemy's force h^re had proceeded down river in this way by night marches in order to oppose General Aylmer's advance, leaving a division at least, or two, to contain me here. At 4 P M., a column of fullv 2,000 infantry with 6 guns and transport column moved east along the same road eastward by the left bank. The camp on right bank upsteam of us was no,v observed to be much reduced in size. Total casualties from Dece nber 4th to December 31st 1916, 1,774- On 5th January, a large column I estimated at 8 ,000 men at least, with guns, its length some 5 miles, was seen moving east towards Es Sinn by the left bank road. On 5th January, the following telegram was received from the Corps Com mander, No. 13-147-G. (13-145-G?), dated 4th January at 10 P.M. S164GSBU APPPENDIX A. Copy of a telegram from Corp, to G. H Q., Basrah, No 13-147. must mean 13-145-G., dated 4th January 1916. '• Following telegram has been received from General Head Quarters* Begins Our estimate of enemy forces down stream of Bghailan is 4=Uh and 36th Divisions totalling 11 ,^00 bayonets with 41 ijuns on right bank, 9 miles west of Kut. 5th Composite 51st and 18th on left bank facing Townshend total 12,900 bayonets 24 guns. On left bank possibly Es-Sinn35th Division—total 2,500 with 18 guns. Shaikh Saad both banks 4 battalions gendarmerie, «oo cavalry and 1,200 composed of camelry. These numbers are considered maxima especially as regards guns the dispositions of which are also doubtful and may be overestimated. Of these six divisions all but 3^^ have been one time or other severely handled by us and have probably diminished morale it seems unlikely enemy will give you opportunity of inflicting decisive defeat down stream of Kut but will concentrate in force west of that place. Army Commander therefore considers that after relieving Xownshend you should entrench in the most suitable position in the neighbourhood of Kut and await further reinforcements. You Will doubtless consult Townshend as to the most suitable position in which to establish yourself. After having established yourselt please suggest nearest place where all the remaining reinforcements can be concentrated. Ends. Reference above Corps Commander would like your views regarding last two paragraphs.' The following telegram was sent in reply. APPENDIX B. Copy of a telegram from 6th Division to Corps and G. H. Q., No. 69-68-G., dated 5th January 1916. %i Reference 13-147-G. (? I cannot agree with this estimate of 26,000 infantry and 83 guns for had the enemy possessed this number they would nave walked over us into Kut. My estimate is that enemy have no more than 16,000 combatants and 32 guns. 12^00 I estimated at beginning of s.ege which is increased to 16,000 by the arrival of 5th Division. 1 lost 1 840 killed and wounded up to and including January 3rd, then Turks must have lost 4,000. Arrival of another division since the 5th is very much I'air Why have not they delivered a determined assault ? They would have done in such a case. I should think 4,0^0 or 5,000 as a cover 5,000 as a minimum force left in the trenches to conta n me. This would leave 12,000 say in a defensive position at Es Sinn. An air reconnaissance should be able to clear up this question both as to maximum force holding me. Addressed Corps, repeated Army.' On lanuary 8th a very hard fought engagement, it would appear took place between General Younghusb^nd and one division and the whole of the enemy s forces some 2^ miles downstream of Shaikh Saad ; Corps Commander said in his wire that it would appear he was up against the whole of the Turkish forces with the exception of those facing me. It is anticipated further heavy fig lin g 'S probable. He added Will you consider advisability of making a sortie and let me know ?' Accordingly in reply 1 sent the following wire •• No. 60--4-G., 8th January. 1 was unaware of your fighting yesterday below Shaikh S^ad, on left bank I suppose. I do not know wh^ti5 numbers contain me here, they are hidden in trenches which sur round me. No air reconnaissance came on January 7th as you said it would. 1 should guess about 4,000 contain us here. I have contemplated a sortie of course to harass Turks on their retreat on left bank past me. I have in fact been thinking out what 1 should do if you were repulsed and it is in my mind in such a case to attempt to cut my way out, it would be well worth trying if i could even carry cff two-thirds of the garrison ; is that so ? Such a step means abandoment of all guns and all wounded and sick, we have no means of reaching the right bank in sufficient rapiditv to make effort successful. I think 1 can fight my way out on land side left bank, crossing maze of trenches by probable ramps which I am having made now. Fuch a step would only be a desperate necessity, it could not be called in any way advisable at this distance as yet. I trust and hope you can give me better news to-day. If Turkish forces have gone to meet you. they cannot be strongly entrenched and their convoys have to go all the way from here with ammunition, etc. Addressed Corps Commander, repeated General Headquarters.' At 4-45 A. M., I received the following wire from General Headquarters :— APPENDIX C. Copy of a telegram from G. H. Q. to 6th Divinion and Corps, No. 10^8-262-0., dated 8th January 1916. Reply to 69-74-G. *' Army Commander directs you not to to resort expediency of cutting your way out except in desperate extremity 1 We have plenty of reinforcements here which are being sent up as empty shipping is returned from up river and also daily by road. Will Corps keep Townshend fully informed of situation. Both acknowledge. Addressed 6th Division, repeated Corps.' I received the following wire from Corps Commander at 5-25 p.m. APPENDIX D. Copy of a telegram from Corps Commander to G. O. C., 6th Division, No. 13-162 G., dated 8th January 1916. ' On January 5th aeroplane reported enemy strongly entrenched astride the river about two miles east of Shaikh Saad, numbers as follows: 4,500 on north side of river, 6^500 on south side, the latter includes some 2,000 cavalry ; enemy has no bridge with them.' And at 10 p.m. I also received the following wire from the Corps Commander. APPENDIX E, Copy of a telegram from Corps Commander, to 6th Division and G, H. Q,, No, 13- 164-G., dated 8th January 1916. ' Reply to 69-74-G. In asking you to consider advisability of making sortie I only of course meant by way of creating a diversion and thus relieving pressure here. There is absolutely ro idea yet of your having to cut your way through. I do, however, contemplate some delay in reaching you as I am opposed by very considerable numbers. Addressed 6th Division, repeated G. H. Q.'i6 I heard from Corps Com;nander on night of January 8th that owing to fatigue of troops on account of yesterday's efforts he had been unable^ to make any progress to-day. He had troops on both banks of river; he estimated he was opposed by 15 ooo Turks, his own casualties he thought were approximately 0,000, and he said his forward progress would be slow till reinforcements arrived. On January 9th my food supply for garrisoii is as follows British troops ... ••• ••• ••• 3° days rations. Indian troops ... ••• ••• 2 9 »i » Grain ... ••• ••• ® »' '* Fodder ... ••• ••• ^ ' o Tinned meat ... ••• ••• ••• ' ' Meat on hoof ... ••• ••• ••• x ^ ' *' I have again asked for air*plane on January 9th so that I can get rough estimate of Turks here containing me. 1 do not think there is more than one division or say 7,000 men. There is no doubt that if I attacked tneir main camp on left bank and took it and drove steamers, etc., away, it would bring Turks back here very quickly. But 1 must have no doubt about winning and my troops are far different from what they were two or three months ago. We have had rainy weather last day or two A telegram was received from the Corps Co mmander to say the enemy had retired upsiream (from Shaikh ^Saad) and that he was pursuing— 'heavy rain makes movement most difficult.' On lanuary loth Corps Commander informs me his troops are greatly exhausted by wet and cold, and I gathered that his troops weie still divided on both sides of the river, t. e , General Kemball and 6 battalions, Shaikh saad on right bank, remainder of Corps on left bank. No air reconnaissance possible owing to inclement weather ; present reports indicate enemy was retiring on or beyond Orah. I wired to Corps Commander on 10th January pointing out that Nur-ed Din was fighting delaying actions in order to save time for some other portion o Turkish Army to join hi n. This is only my opinion but to me it is odious- Also it was plain that he had retreated in the night unmolested which did not look like a defeat. Bunting was displayed on the Turkish steamers this morning, ships being dressed and cheers were given in their trenches. We ascribed this to the British force at Gallipoli having re-embarked. On the afternoon of 10th January 4 or 5 parties of infantry—none of them under 200 men— walking in groups and not in military formation, apparently slightly wounded, came past us from doun river on left bank going west. We saw a considerable number of tents on the right bank which had not been there before situated about ' D ' in Dujailah. 'Ihere was much activity m Turkish main camp this afternoon. Corps Commander wired me that his losses were 3 793 wounded alone at Shaikh Saad, he cannot {jive number of dead yet but in proportion his dead must be 600 or 700 I should say ; he said Turks had retired to Es . inn and were in position there on both banks. He spoke of very bad weather wet and cold ; we had beautiful weather here on January 10th. At 10 P M. on lanuary 10th, I received a telegram from the Corps Com mander saving the Tutks had returned again and were entrenching a line on bo.h banks of'ihe Wadi Creek or river. This supposed to be Chuhibat at th top of the Orah Bend about 9 miles upsiream of Shaikh Saad on the left bank. We could tell by intercepted wireless that General Aylmer was attacking Turks in their p ..it,on on the Wadi Creek on January 13th and that General*7 Younghusband was turirng the position whilst General Kemball held them in front, and at about midnight of i3-i4th January, I received a uireless message from the Corps Commander to say at dusk Kemball was holding enemy alonsj his eastern front two miles along the Wadi. Younghusband had pushed round north of enemy's position and claimed that his right flank wa? almost up to river Tigris. I did not know what troops Aylmer had on right bank. I suppose only small minimum force. On January 14th, intercepted message in the morning showed that enemy were supposed to be retiring, and Kemball was starting in pursuit, enemy's loss supposed to be heavy, and at 11-35 A M., General Aylmer's telegram No. 11-112 G., indicated that battle had been of an obstinate and indecisive nature ; but enemy seemed in retreat as large masses were observed moving west ; the turning move of the 7th Division had been held up during yesterday by forces of enemy facing north and fighting on line east and west, and action had been close and continuous till nightfall. General Kemball had attacked enemy's front with 28th Brigade but had been repulsed and had withdrawn to east bank of Wadi Stream. * January 15th. —I was now much concerned at slow progress of relief force: we are now halfway through January, the date on which General Aylmer decided in his No. n 15-G. of 16th December as being hazardous to expect me to hold out beyond. I only shut myself up at Kut on the distinct understanding that 1 was relieved in a month, and we have now been six weeks. The relief force of two divisions fought two indecisive actions pushing the enemy back, for only three or four miles at most, and has suffered at least as heavily as the enemy and I expect much more heavily, January 16th. —Corps Commander informed me in a telegram to the Army Commander (repeated to me) that from fact that I had seen guns and infantry coming back to Turkish main camp on left bank it was indicated to him that the enemy's intention was to delay relieving force in a defile and bring down large body from their bridge above Kut on Es Sinn on right bank in order to fight there or beyond it to cut communications of General Aylmer. He said he was throwing bridge across Tigris just above Wadi and putting all the troops of 7th Division on right bank, for what reason he did not say. If enemy does not advance, he said, in the meantime he (General Aylmer) would advance when he had done tnis, endeavouring to outflank enemy's position in defile (caused by proximity of marsh to river on left bank) from right bank. The enemy were very busy all day here digging and putting up barbed wire on the left bank east of the fort ; it would appear to prevent us from making a sortie of force at night by that exit. What appeared to be a German General with staff of German officers, and with some Turkish officers, was seen inspect ing the Turkish lines here. January 77^.'—The news to-day received by wireless from Corps Commander' was depressing ; further advance was prevented by atrocious weather which delayed his construction of bridge. His loss in engagements of the 7th and 13th January amounted to over 6,000 killed and wounded, report of wastage was considered in excess of reinforcements he has received from AU-al-Gharbi ; he ended by saying his fighting strength does not now exceed 9,000 combatants. Doubt was created in my mind as to possibility of relief force being able to join hands with me by receipt of following wireless messages :— APPENDIX F. Copy of a telegram from Corps Commander, to General Head Quarters, No. 11-131, G., dated 16th January 19 6. •''The position of affairs must be frankly faced. The enemy is blocking the entrance of the Wadi-Nakhailat defile with very strong works and judging from his disposition within them they have been designed to resist a heavy bombardment from across the river as well as attack in front his bivouac shelters seem to indicate18 that he may have with him the whole 52nd Division and two regi ments of the 35th and 38th Divisions. But of course I cannot be certain ot this. Emplacements for 19'guns have been seen, n of which are designed to fire across the river. Behind in dehle there is a single line of entrenchments through Y of Sannaiyat between marsh and river probably miles long. Behind again is the Es Sinn position. It is impossible in my opinion to take the first position by a coup de main from this side alone without losing half the force. (More to follow).' APPENDIX G. Copy of a telegram from Corps Commander to General Head Qaarters, No. n -I32 -G., dated ijth January 1916. 'It was my intention to cross the 3rd Division and Cavalry Brigade to right bank directly bridge is finished and thus enfilade enemy s position. Even by this means I do not think our progress as an entire force can be anything but very slow. Information indicates that reinforcements may have begun to arrive at Kut and these may soon amount to a very considerable number. On right bank below Kut at present there do not seem to be at outside more than 2,000 men and rain is evidently rendering the Hai crossing difficult for transport. The best plan seems to me for Townshend to cross river during night with such able bodied men as he has got in the mahelas and other river transpoit available and march well round Es-Sinn position on the right bank. I would cross about one division and Cavalry Brigade at same time and march to meet him and bring him back here. The opportunity is now favourable and may cease directly enemy sends troops down right bank which may be very soon. (More follows).' APPENDIX H. Copy of a telegram from Corps Commander to G. H. Q., No. ii -133-G., dated 17th January 1916. ' On December 20th, Townshend informed me that he had 50 mahelas besides other river craft. If these still exist it should be about sufficient for his purpose though he would have to leave sick unable to march and destroy most of his material. If Townshend thinks this possible I shall issue orders for him to do so. Addressed G. H. Q,. repeated 6th Division who is requested to wire at once possibility of passage and earliest date on which he can be ready remembering opportunity may not recur.' Before I could send an answer to the above, I received following telegram from the Army Commander. APPENDIX I. Copy of a telegram Army Commander to Corps and 6th Division, No. 1008-309 -0., dated 17th January 1916. n I do not in any way agree with your appreciation of the situation or that the same calls for Townshend to take the extreme step you propose. Only circumstances that could in my opinion justify this course would be a demoralisation of your force which I have no reason to suspect. You have been opposed from Shaikh Saad by 38th and 52nd Divisions, some gendarmerie and cavalry totalling19 rather over 15,000 with at the outside 41 guns and you have twice defeated them. Townshend has been contained by 45th and 51st Divisions, to atlling possibly 8,000 with 17 guns. Towns hend has reported strong column estimated one division and 13 guns retiring to main camp, west of Kut. Enemy have further suffered losses estimated by you at 4,500 Shaikh Saad and 2,000 Wadi. You therefore should have between you and Kut not more than 5,000 and possibly 27 guns. The total of your losses should almost have been made good by reinforcing units. Your bridge gives you freedom of manoeuvre. The course you originaily proposed namely to employ part of your force on right bank should not only promise success but afford you opportunitv of in flicting severe blow on enemy and effecting speedy relief of Townshend. I cannot believe that position in front of you can equal in strength those attacked and captured by us in the past which had been in preparation for four months. The course you now propose for Townshend in your telegram under reply would be disastrous from every point of view, to Townshend's force, to your force, to the whole of the forces in Mesopotamia and to the Empire and I cannot sanction it. There is no reason to suppose enemy has yet been reinforced by a sixth division and the possi bility of its arrival only emphasises necessity for prompt action. Both acknowledge. Addressed Corps, repeated 6th Division.' On January 17th, I sent message No. 69-97-G., to Corps Commander to say 1 supposed he would now advance by right bank with his maximum force, leaving his minimum force entrenched to guard ships ; it was not likely Turks could take offensive on left bank as long as I held Kut and blocked his steamers and barges, etc. I reminded him that I had informed him on 7th January in my 69-74-G. and in my 69 22-G., of 22nd December that it was impossible for me to gam right bank with rapidity or secrecy unless the relieving force arrived on right bank south of Kut, where he would be covered from enemy by important obstacle of Hai, now five feet deep at the ford. I reckoned that I could put 4,000 men only at the outside across in one night (that would leave 5,000 more combatants in Kut in addition to wounded, sick and followers and departmental men). Animals, officers' chargers and machine gun mules come to about 3,000 and would take three hours a trip ; 25 trips require 75 hours. Three Field Batteries would require some 20 hours. But all guns and munitions of war would have to be destroyed, also animals as none could be crossed in one night which was essential for the success of the sortie. The following telegram was received from Corps Commander. APPENDIX J. Copy of a telegram from Corps Commander to General Headquarters, No. 11-143-G., dated 17th January 1916. 'Reply to 1008-309-O. 1 understand your telegram to mean to desire me to get to Kut in such a way as to hold that place together with Townshend at least till his force can be removed entirely. That is that you do not wish that Townshend breaking through form any part of my plan. If this is so, the plan suggested by Townshend is opposed to your views and in my opinion less likely to succeed than any I suggest ed as my remaining opposite Kut while Townshend took several days to get across river would lead to Turks assaulting the place when half denuded of troops. The only way to relieve Townshend without the necessity for his breaking out is for me to force the S164GSD20 defile and join hands with him by the left bank. This I shall attempt to do by the means already proposed namely cross river with part of my force enfilading enemy and then assaulung his oosition. I have only just succeeded in completing bridge owing to extreme difficulty in getting it up from Shaikh Saad . an ^ re ^' tructing it here on account of storm and torrent of ram the (want of ?) material and only one company Sappers and Miners. Ihe country round sea of mud and animals can hardly move. 1 am usine my utmost endeavours to expedite carrying out plan but it must be recognised that conditions have been extraordinarily unfavourable. A com pari son between works in front ot me and those elsewhere is difficult but these ones cannot be turned except in a modified manner by enfilading force from opposite bank, have just heard bridge is broken off again. Addresssd U. H. y., repeated 6th Division.' On the 18th January I sent the following wireless in reply to above ; — ' Let me make it clear mv project is not right bank , ' ii'fff&gt;rpd vour idea after you had met with such difficulties and had suffered such losses. 1 thought thcre was much in th ®/'S ht b ^ k ' d ^ VOU could plant your guns on right bank en enfilade oi the Turkish entrenchments on the left bank it should dislodge them especially as vour fire would force the Turkish ammunition and food convoys to make a detour northward. No, my project would have been to have advanced on the left bank with all my force united in my hand, since the bulk ot hostile force is on left bank. Perhaps 1 should have entrenched a minimum force of two battalions on the right bank to guard my ships as I did in my action of f &gt; ut l ' September last, on the principle that the enemy must be defeated in order to gain my objective. It seems to me that if you arrive here on south bank as suggested m my 69 -97 -G. ot January 1 7th and aimed your guns east and south ol Kut town on right bank their enfilading fire would facilitate our crossing the river. On same date I indicated to the Corps Commander what I should do if he were unable to relieve me, repeating message to Army Commander ; to attempt sortie in force on right bank with possibly 3 000 men threatened destruction, as enetnv in trenches 300 yards from bank must detect the movement and hen would be destruction when morning came. It means the abandonment ot all wounded sick, guns, transport, etc. My idea was to fight on till no more ammunition was left from trench to trench and house to house. I said that I would have done so when all hope is past, and not till then. Traditions of war in military history justify a General in making terms on fair conditions, like, for example lunof's French lorce in Portugal in 1808 who were transported away in ships with their arms, guns and baggage and landed in France. As long as I hold Kut I said, enemy cannot take offensive against us towards Amarah as his steamers'and barges are absolutely necessary. 'H you cannot relieve me you cannot maintain yourself where you are, you would ha\e to retreat. The rain last night has been heavy and the trenches have two 'jet of water in them and, in many cases, more, causing much discomfort and hardship men. APPENDIX K. Copy ot a telegram from G. H. Q., to 6ih Division and Corps, No. I oo3-3i6.0., dated 18th January 191^. 'In reply to your 69-97-G., of 17th. It would appear you contemplate the practical evacuation of Kut with abandonment of stores and guns after relieving column has reached there. This is by no means the intention of Army Commander. On arrival Avlmer's column our force should be in superior strength to enemy and neither Kut nor guns nor stores must be abandoned.31 If Aylmer's force Is so disposed along Hai to south with portion of it to north on your right flank and is unable at first to clear enemy from your front there would appear to be no difficulty in combined force maintaining their position whilst remainder reinforcements concentrate at Es Sinn or east of same. By first week February all columns now marching should have reached Shaikh Saad including drafts to complete 6th Division to service strength. Force will then total four full divisions except for two brigades Artillery and we should then be able to assume offensive with a view to clearing front and securing permanent position further west covering Kut. Consider and advise Aylmer repeating here what disposition of Corps on arrival would fit best with above plans. Addressed 6th Division repeated Corps.' In answer to the above message of Army Commander, I said in my 69-102-0., dated 18th January that the reason why I contemplated the abandonment of stores and guns was because the Corps Commander, in his telegram 11-132 G. dated 18th January, said it was best thing I could do. Personally I had never wished to abandon Kut, and I had made my stand at Kut becau5e I judged it my duty to hold up the Turkish forces and give time to reinforcements arriving in Mesopotamia to concentrate on Amarah and Ali-al-Gharbi, though I knew well the usual fate of a force • which shuts itself up in an entrenched camp. But I bargained to be relieved in a month and I added that I was delighted to hear that Kut was not to be abandoned. On the 19th January the persistent rain had ceased and we had a fine day heavy gun fire was heard to the eastward. In regard to Army Commander's telegram No. 1008-316-0 of January iSthi last paragraph, 1 proposed to Corps Commander that on arrival of relieving force at Kut he should dispose of the troops as follows:— One division north of fort resting its left flank on the fort, and on left i 1 miles, its right flank thrown slightly forward in a nonh westerly direction. An other division with its right flank resting on fort on front of 2,300 yards or miles, its left resting on the Tigris, in short, along present front of my north ern section of defences. One division on right bank Tigris and on eastern bank of the Hai from where it falls into the Tigris to one mile south with its exterior flank echeloned back. Remaining division would be in general reserve on left bank east of fort, its head about where Turkish bridge of boats fmarked • Not received. ° n '^P,' * USed f 0 . ^ Tw0 bri dge S should be made as quickly as possible so as to give liberty of action and manoeuvre to either bank and avoid the danger of having our forces divided by an impassable river, one bridge near and south of Kut fort, the other at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Hai, both bridges with fortified bridge-heads on right bank. Thus the Army Corps would be roughly on a front of six miles, including the Tigris, some 400 to 500 yards wide. The bulk of Corps would be on the left bank because bulk of enemy's forces are on the left bank and the main road to Baghdad runs on the left bank. The bulk of cavalry would be on the exterior flank of the most northerly divi sion on the left bank ; two squadrons with the division on the right bank. The bulk of artillery would be with the minimum force on the right bank. Field ambulances, supplies, munitions, etc., in Kut town. January 20th (Thurfday). I received message from General Aylmer that he was now ready to attack, one to two divisions and cavalry brigade and some guns were on the right bank in order to enfilade right flank of the Turkish entrenched position on the left bank. Their main position stretched from marsh to river through tf [ ' in Sannaiyat. 43 We were astonished at Kut yesterday evening to see over 2000 infantry with large number of camel transport coming back from Es Sinn position direct on the left bank. This would leave only some 4,500 Turks in front of General Aylmer. We could hear General Aylmer 4 s guns bombarding the Turkish position all to-day ; he informed me he would assault the position to-morrow at daybreak. We have now 14 days' full rations for British and Indian troops on this date, fodder up to January 25^1,30 days' grain for animals without commandeering foodstuffs in the town. S164GSB 622 At 2 P.M. 1 received message from the Corps Commander No. 11-162- G., dated January 21st, giving very bad news; his assault had been repuls- edi his troops had remained within 100 to 200 yards from enemy's front line, only one battalion, viz. the Black Watch, had succeeded in getting into enemy's trenches, and they had been bombed out again. He intended, he said, resuming the bombardment, assaulting again this afternoon. It rained hard all day ; the swollen river had flooded my first line trenches and even part of middle line to the misery of the troops in the trenches, and it seemed without doubt, work as we might, water would compel us to abandon first line defence, isolating fort so to speak. I decided now to put the troops on half rations and lay hands on all food stuff in the town. In the evening I received another message No. ii - i 63-G. dated January 21 st, from Corps Commander that afternon assault had failed also; he announced a third assault for to-morrow afternoon. He feared his casualties had been very heavy. APPENDIX L. Copy of a telegram from Corps CoTimanier, to G. H. Q., No. 11-164-0, dated aist January 1916. ' We have made two assaults on enemy's entrenched position here without success. I shall renew attack to-morrow but I can acknowledge that at present it appears rather a forlorn hope. My losses have been very heavy. The only way you can help us is to make a sortie on a large scale and endeavour to defeat what is in front of you, returning on to Kut again. Success would mean that the enemy now opposing me would probably withdraw from this defile. The enemy's losses said to be undoubtedly very considerable both from artillery and infantry fire. He has received two battalions at least as reinforcements from where I cannot say as air reconnaissance is impossible. If you can do this, please do it soon. Addressed 6th Division, repeated G. H.

The country is now in a most flooded and boggy condition, result being movement of troops most difficult, their suffering great. On right bank General Officer Commanding, 3rd Division, reports river to have topped bank in one place and to be rapidly forming large marsh to the west of position recently occupied by him thus creating serious obstruction to artillery starting advance up the river by that bank. I am forced to abandon my intention re attacking enemy's position to-morrow as troops in front line have been withdrawn without my orders to vicinity entrenched position occupied two days ago about 1,300 yards from enemy's trenches. Their great disorganisation owing to unsuccessful attempt to storm enemy's position makes it utterly impossible to send them back again at present. 1 shall send my views to-morrow on situation.

I am sending a request to Turks for 6 hours armistice to bury dead and bring away wounded. For the present I shall hold the line about 1,300 yards» in front of enemy's position and a reserve line behind. The troops condition may be regarded as prohibiting advance for the present.

' From detailed statements taken from six prisoners including one officer which follows it will be seen that force in front of me yesterday consisted of whole of 52nd and combined 35th and 38th Divisions plus two battalions 51st Division plus 26 guns. Drafts have evidently been lately received by units. Allowing for previous losses this force would amount to at least 9,000 infantry. I am quite certain Townshend has observed most carefully but if all troops reported by him as marching east and west during last fortnight be taken as additions and deduction from enemy in front of me I should have only had to fight about 5 000 yesterday and 2,000 to-day not allowing for losses. My parlementaire to-day who was towards front position himself saw two regiments and one artillery commander and Khalil Bey's name was given as in com mand who is reported to have superseded Nur-ed-Din. My losses are very heavy indeed. I cannot yet ascertain numbers in all cases but 9th Brigade alone lost over 1,000 and 27 officers. The troops are not at present in a state to assault such a position again even if held by ^,000 men. The troops have done most nobly all that is possible in the face of the severest conditions. I cannot call on them to do what is impossible in their present state. I shall naturally do all I can to ascertain remaining strength of enemy in front of me. I arranged armistice up to 6 p.m ., to-day and a certain number of wounded have been brought in and dead buried but Turks have taken into their lines the wounded from immediate' ly in front of their trenches and were most active in doing so.

Paragraph J.—Send back all river craft thus emptied. I have ordered Gorringe to proceed to Amarah for purpose of organising reinforce ments now on road and sending them up to you.

' Reply to 13-205-G. The events of the past few days require me now to face the situation from the point of view of my command. Co you consider that two brigades of infantry and one battery are sufficient reinforcements to enable you to join hands with me at Kut. If there is doubt I had better be told at once as 1 have to make up my mind to do one of three things. (a) To attempt to break out as you suggest In your 11-132-G., and 11- 133-G., ot January 17th. 1 should make straight for Shaikh Saad by the desert route 25 miles and would ask you to send a column to meet me more than halfway if possible. Between January 28th and February 3rd moderate conditions will enable me to get about 4,000 able-bodied men there mostly commissariat, engineers, sap pers, gunners, signal, flying men, British infantry, Indian infan try and Indian cavalry, proportion of medical personnel; wounded, sick, weakly men and those unable to march, followers, etc , left behind giving sufficient guard for wounded in hospital all under a brigade commander, one who could make terms with the enemy. All guns would be destroyed. Samana with two barges to communi cate run gauntlet and your Senior Naval Officer could assist her through if she require it. We should carry 200 rounds great coat and two days food on back. (^) It is probable if Kut falls the enemy will be able to take active mea sures against you and you will get surrounded or turned by the Pusht i-Kuh for example, but enemy cannot take offensive against you in reality until they can get reinforcements through here I think. Would (you) prefer that 1 should defend Kut step by step until no ammunition remains on the Saragossa principle so as to give you time to make British position a strong one at Amarah and Nasiriyah. In conversation with Chief I said It was a mistake to go north of Amarah with the force we had in Mesopotamia and when Sir John Nixon informed me that 1 was to advance on Ctesiphon and Baghdad with my one division I considered it my duty to write officially and point out great risk of such a step asking for a Corps or at least two divisions to do it. Having done so I had done my duty and had to carry out my orders and make my plans to the best of my ability as I had done in the advance from Amarah against Kut. To my mind I was certain that as soon as we dropped the offensive in Dardanelles we should quickly feel the effect in the secondary field of Mesopotamia and I believe Turks are now making Mesopotamia the principal field in which they are sending their maximum forces. Had 1 been given two divisions and got into Baghdad we should not have got out again. If you are not strong enough to join hands with me here I do not believe you will be able to remain where you are.25 W When all hope is past a General is justified in making the best terms with the enemy he can. With some 25 days food in hand I could begin to negotiate with the enemy. 1 might be allowed to march and join you with arms and pouch ammunition but I suppose they would insist on the force being paroled not to serve against the Turks and perhaps her allies for the rest of the war. I should bargain for the best terms I could of course which 1 think they would be inclined to grant so as to get Kut quickly. Which course of the three above would be of best use to Government supposing you tell me there is no hope of relief. I suppose (a) is the best. You have done all that men could do I know. I hope your troops realise that we know and feel. I feel it terribly too that my command is in this situation through no fault of ours and I trust Government will consider we have done our duty. I suppose General Baratoff is now at Kasr-i-Shirin ; could he not be told the situation here and asked to seriously menace Baghdad ? Addressed Corps Commander, repeated G.H.Q.' APPENDIX R.

(Very secret to be deciphered by one of your own staff officers.) I still hope to effect your relief but shall be better able to express definite opinion after 1 have reached Aylmer's Headquarters about 28th instant. In any case alternatives {b) and {c) are both unnecessary and out of the question. Yourself and staff should prepare plans so that first alternative (a) could be carried into effect in case of extremity but no idea of same should be allowed to reach your garrison. Consider also possibility of more effective co -coperation with relieving force on assumption that Aylmer's operations might take form of an advance in force by right bank leaving minimum force to contain enemy on left bank. I don't wish fact of my coming up to be made public. Addressed 6th Division, repeated Corps, both acknowledge.' APPENDIX S. Copy of a telegram from Corps to G.H.Q., Basrah, No. U-177-G., dated 23rd January 1916. ' Reference to General Townshend's No. 69-112-0. of to-day. I know Army Commander disagrees with me but 1 must again affirm that in my opinion as previously expressed and as confirmed by recent experience I am not in a position to reach Kut so as to effect entire relief of Townshend. I believe even after reinforcements now on their way do arrive we shall have very little chance of success. I have now only 9,000 infantry left and have just suffered a severe reverse, i am very doubtful of the morale of a good many Indian troops especially as I have now the gravest suspicions very extensive self mutilation among them : it is my deliberate opinion formed after the gravest consideration that the best course would be to adopt Townshend's plan as suggested by me originally and vetoed by Army Commander. If this plan is now sanctioned I require earliest possible intimation as 1 must cancel arrangements now under way for sending down all available ships which I must retain in order to carry plans and effect my own retirement when this is done. Details only would be arranged between Townshend and myself. All ships now being sent down with wounded should be S164GSB26 returned instantly with troops to Shaikh Saad or later to All Gharbi so as to assist difficult task of my retirement from this posi tion where I am in actual touch with the enemy and have a most difficult road to follow on both banks owing to recent floods. Reference Townshend's 69-113 G. of to-day I have already expressed my opinion these columns seen by him do not necessarily indicate deductions from force in front of me. They are much more ''ke y to be reliefs Townshend not being shown troops going the other way. Addressed G. H. Q., repeated 6th Division. APPENDIX T.

' I am quite readv to make attempt to break my way out as f said in my 69-11 2-G. of January 23rd, but it is entirely dependent for success on luck in not being heard or discovered during my movements. The course suggested by Army Commander in his 1008-346 -0. of Janu ary 23rd, namely, that you should advance in force along the right bank leaving a minimum force on left bank to contain enemy, offers more certainty in my opinion vtde my 69-97-0. of January 17th. The Shatt-al-Hai is now a very formidable obstacle and the enemy will be very careful I should say of putting a large force on the right bank east of this river with the chance of your throwing them into it. He has only one crazy ma he la bridge. I have 22 days' food left now but by collecting all the atta in the town and eating up the horses we can last out much longer. There would be the difficulty then about feeding Arab population here. Perhaps the Army Commander could in this case get more troops from India to make certain of our relief. Addressed Corps, repeated H.Q. and G.H.Q.' APPENDIX U. Copy of a telegram from 6th Division to Headquarters, No. 69.115-G., dated 34th January 1916. In continuation of my 69-114 G. of January 24th in regard to other sources of food outside the rations. Wheat atta we have 34 days for troops and 33 for townspeople; the oil mill will work for 30 days more. In addition we have 80 tons or 2,400 maunds of barley in the town and 11,000 maunds of (same?) in the woollen press village occupied by us on right bank. We have 3,000 horses and mules available for food, this question I have not brought forward till now as I should not be justified in killing them till you tell me there is no hope of relief. I suppose only Europeans would eat the horse meat and at 10 horses or mules a day there is practically unlimited food for Europeans. My A. D. S. has been for some time purchasing wheat atta in the town and Military Governor has for some time past by my orders been feeding every day 625 Arabs who have no money to purchase food, and sells the grain purchased by us at Government rates from Arab merchants to 3,000 Arabs daily at a low rate. On whe£U atta alone, including my 22 days rations, I have got for 34 days longer, not counting barley, meal and horse meat. Of course 1 do not suppose the enemy will leave me tranquil as soon as he ? discovers you are at a standstill and awaiting reinforcements : he will attempt a supreme effort against me, no doubt taking troops from in front of you for that purpose. Addressed Corps Commander, repeated H. Q. and G.H.Q, '27 APPENDIX V. Copy of a telegram from 6th Division to Headquarters, No, 69-117-0., dated 2 5th January 1916. The meeting of the two columns on a bearing is quite uncertain, but your column could have instructions to fall back again if they do not see my column. Of course my being able to get across this river will be a matter of luck to say the least of it. Preceding covering pdrty will have to deal with snipers and certainly a patrol or two with the bavonet. Given a successful crossing I should make for Musjid which is a conspicuous land-mark indica ting road to Shaikh Saadand it bears 105 degrees east from Kut town. This is probably occupied by infantry outpost which we should perhaps have to rush but Turks keep bad watch at night generally speaking Subri Bey and a mounted force are not formidable, and if I can manage to bring two 13-pounders with me. will keep, I know well, at a respectful distance. The crossing of river without detection is most difficult, and success lies in that alone. In the defence of a fortress I know well that in history a General should try to cut his way out with whnt men remain discip lined and in good heart; it is a duty he owes to his country to do so and that he has to leave his wounded and sick to the mercy of the enemy who, when civilised, respect this, and the Turks have always acted well in this respect, but the swollen river on all sides except one, and that impossible, is a good example of the difference between theory and practice, and the desert Arabs in hordes on your flank and rear reminds me that the theory applies rather to Europe than here. But it is a terrible thing to have to leave behind me the wounded and sick and so many weakly men who have all trusted me and Government knows how they have fought under me, and abandon them like a thief in the night. I repeat I know my first duty is to try and save able-bodied men to the Government and I was the first to tell you and Sir John Nixon that I would attempt to cut my way out if you were repuls ed as you will remember when I said that as a desperate necessity only I would cut my way out or endeavour to do so. More follows.' APPENDIX W. Copy of a telegram from 6th Division to H.Q, No, 69 -118-G., dated 25th January 1916. ' Continuation mv 69 -117-G. I hope you will confer with Army Com mander before the thing is finally settled that you cannot appear before us by a *' coup de main ' on the right bank when you get your reinforcements. I should consider Subri Bey and his mount ed troops and possible two battalions no obstacle at all. Kemball will tell you how 1 disposed of Subri Bey by a night march and attack at Kutunie when he and his force bolted at dawn just as 1 got on to him. I do not see why we should not hang on here for another two months as my food wire will have shown you yes terday, in which case Army Commander could call troops from India or even Australians from Melbourne. The Turks will be very chary of trying to rush me alter what they have received here already and they have example of what loss they could inflict on you from behind their beloved trenches. The Turk is a contemptible fighter in the open but formidable behind wall or trench. The same troops, that is, the divisions, are the same now in front of you who fled when we closed with them at Es Sinn last September and the same at Ctesiphon but it was of course their flank turned and we attacked in two columns 011 fronts of not more than 600 to 700 yards a brigade.9 a8 I hope you will then weigh the matter well with Army Commander and remember my being able to cross river without detection at night is I may say the case of spinning a coin. Addressed Corps, repeated H.Q. and G.H.Q.' The above telegrams are inserted to show the first effort to relieve my garn son has failed. It was perfectly impossible for me to make a sortie m force when engaged in fighting the inundation invading my trenches; the enemy had also been driven out of his front trenches which presented the appearance of canals so to speak, and formed an amazing network ol mole-like works which we esti mated thirty miles in extent in their tortuous windings. It would be ditticult to get mv troops out in daytime with no enemy to oppose me. I am having ram ps a ' a hand bridges made to throw over the trenches to get guns over before the floods and rains come. f I telegraphed to Corps Commander telling him about the conditions of weather and affairs with me and asking him whether it would not be wisest mean while for him to await reinforcements. I could last 27 days on half rations an added after two repulses of the nature he described a third attack was not h e Y to succeed and I accordingly submitted the following three proposals to the •See To wnshend 's 69-11 a-G., of i3rd January, Commander asking him to say w ic Appendix q. course Government would prefer me to take.* It will be seen my reasons for shutting myself up in Kut are plainly stated in the commencement of this report ; it was to gam time ^^7^! arriving in Mesop tamia to concentrate at Amarah and Ah-al-Gharbi, but ba gained 5 ' to be relieved in one month from the 4th December, at the furthest be January JQth as otherwise large reinforcements might reach Turks from the north and my relief would become an impossibility. It will be seen that the Army Commander favoured ^yP 1 ^ W telegram No. 69-112-G., dated January 23rd, vis., that l should endeavour t break my way out on the right bank. But in conversation with my second-in- command— Melliss—when showing him proposals I had made ' he . ex P r . es ^ e f 1 } opinion that the second proposal of mine was the best, for by breaking out I could only hope to get some three thousand to four thousand men out by she luck and would have to leave behind another four to five thousand combatants, all my wounded and sick, destroy guns, etc., and he thought our best course and duty to the Empire was to hold on here and so hold up the Turks and after thinking the matter over most carefully I came to the same opinion, although in history a General has often been known to cut his way out and save two-thirds of the garrison, but that history applies to Europe and not to Mesopotamia where every halid and every rifle is against us. The difference between theory and practice and criticism and execution is well exemplified here in Kut. I am surrounded by an impassable great river on three sides whilst en the remaining north-west side the Turks hem me in in a triple line of great trenches and vast network of barbed wire. It would want Maskelyne and Cook to get out of this place and if I could get away with 3,000 of force only, it would be a miracle, and there are no miracles in war. On the banks of the impassable river are networks 01 trenches and barbed wire. Therefore I considered my course (^) m my telegram No. 69-112-G. f dated January 23rd, was the best course to pursue, so 1 d e t er mmed to ad o pt it. ie.,my proposal (6) in the above telegram, irrespective of what orders 1 might get convinced of its being the best rule to play-in other words I would make Kut into a second Plevna and 1 accordingly sent following telegram APPENDIX X. Copy of a telegram from Sth Division to Head Quarters, No. S9-U9-G., dated ijth January 1916. •' Continuation my 69 -117 ii8-G. of 25th.29 I have carefully thought out the situation and wish to sum up my ideas and give you my views and the conclusion I have come to. Paragraph /.—(r/) Not only is breaking out a pure question of chance, a spin of the coin, owing to having to cross the river undetected at night, but I can only in case of success extricate some 3,000 combatants leaving 5,000 combatants obtainable exclusive of wounded and sick and all guns. {h) By thus doing Kut falls at once and lets the Turks immediately take the offensive down the Tigris, for as long as I resist at Kut they cannot get past their ships, munitions, stores, etc. (^) You could not remain where you are or you may share my fate ; you would h'ive to retreat in a hostile country and doubt if you could remain at Amarah, and Nasiriyah would most likely be surrounded and fall. (fi) Thus we lose all the territory we have gained in last year's cam paign and it becomes disastrous and inglorious. It is for (£), (c) and {d) above that 1 arrested my retirement from Ctesiphon and made a stand at Kut, it was my own decision. {e) While I hold Kut the Russians can from Kasr-i.Shirin seriously menace Baghdad. More follows.' APPENDIX Y, Copy of a telegram from Townshend to Heai Quarters, No. 69-120 G., dated a5th January 1916. ' In continuation of 69-119-G. of January 25th. Paragraph 2. —I have now placed all food in the town under Annesley my A. D. S., collected all the food stuff and rationed inhabitants. I now find that we can last for 84 days as regards food supplies, great stores of barley having beei discovered, besides all this 1 have 3,000 animals to feed on. Paragraph 3. —As regards the want of morale of a good many of your Indian troops I have the same here in a more modified form. It is my handful of Norfolks, Dorsets, Oxfords who are my sheet anchor here. We do not want inferior drafts of Indian recruits from India as my battalions were filled up with after the battle of Kut-al-Amarah in September last. Melliss, Delamain, Hamilton and Hoghton will bear me out in this, one or two good all British divisions are what we want. Then now is the time to demand good white troops from over seas, an Army Corps to save and hold Mesopotamia if Government considers it worth holding. The Germans know that Mesopotamia and not Egypt is the best avenue of approach to India and that is why all these German oncers are here now, so I take it Mesopotamia is worth holding and we have shed much blood to gain thus far. Paragraph —I repeat I think the Turks will not have the heart to leave their safe trenches and overwhelm me out of my trenches and houses, they would lose terribly at that game and have lost heavily when they tried to do so. Paragraph 5.—The floods will arrive I suppose in February (and will ?) compel Turks to recede and the side with the most gunboats obtains the sea power as they enabled me to take Amarah last June. * Paragraph 6. —The more I think out the situation the more convinced I am that the best and highest role I can play is that of Osman Pasha at Plevna where months of defence held up the Russian advance and saved Constantinople. In the same way the defence of Kut will save the whole of the Basrah Vilayet ; it will give the Si 4GSB3° Army Commander time to get soli^ reinforcements and render the memory of the privation a glorious one instead of letting it end in disaster. Addressed Corps, repeated H. Q. and G. H. Q.' APPENDIX Z. Copy of a telegram from Corps to Head Quarters, No. 11-189-G., dateJ 35th January 1916, ' It must be acknowledged that Townshend's numbers 69-r 17 and ii8-G. throw a completely new light on the situation. I am delighted that his food supplies are now found much better than I could know from previous telegrams which pointed to February 17th as the date to which he could subsist on half rations. 1 quite recognise that there are other factors besides food with which he may have to contend in his splendid defence but this new information had it been communicated to me before would certainly have modified much what I have unsuccessfully attempted to do and what I have proposed. I certainly no longer desire to adopt plan («). Yourtelegiam of to-day 1008-355-O. lam sending down all except two ships as soon as they can be cleared but conditions here vtz :—living in a sea of mud and exhausted troops and transport does not allow last two ships starting before to-morrow evening. ' Addressed H. Q. repeated G. H. Q. and 6th Division.' On the 26th January we saw what we estimated at a division moving east wards from the Turkish camp above Kut on the right bank evidently in order to cross the Hai in the neighbourhood of Mhairiyah where there are mahelas iroored and we suppose a crossing, for we have seen men working there and taking timber and poles to the place. I suppose the destination of this division is Es-Sinn position on right bank. I informed the Corps Commander of the above and I also explained the reason with reference to his telegram No. 11-189-0., dated 25th January, why I did not bring up the food question before. (&lt;?) There was no necessity to do so until the question whether I could be relitved or not arose. The question in Parliament was that 1 was to be relieved by January 10th, because after that date, by the Corps Commander's own appreciation of the situation, there would be a danger of large Turkish reinforcements reaching Baghdad and so making my relief impossible. I had ample rations to last over date. Thus 1 do not see in what way the Corps Commander's (plans) would have been modified had he known I had so much food. (^) The Arab population here is 6,000, distinctly hostile to us and fraternise with the Turks. Such numbers in my midst are an additional danger and I have to keep a considerable force of military police to watch them by day and by night. I had searched houses for arms. I did not want to search for food until obliged, it will be easily understood ; I knew there was much food in the town naturally as much as we could have accommodated up to 119 days' food includ ing Government rations, etc. • January 2Sih. —Enemy anpeared to be disposing more troops in the neighbourhood of Mhairiyah with a view to holding the lines of the Hai. January 31st. —After inspecting the fort and its works I have decided pot to evacuate it although we have been driven out of first line of defence bythe inundations, but to hold it on the prirciple of a detached post ready to withdraw its small garrison if seriously menaced. Our casualties since December 4th now total 2,282. On the 3rd February I received a gracious message from His Excellency the Viceroy transmitted through General Headquarters, and communicated it in a special order to my troops, in the following terms :— ' Please transmit following message from me to General Townshend. The bravery and endurance with which you and the troops under your command have resisted the attacks of the enemy have excited the admiration of all and I am confident resistance will be main* tamed until help reaches you in the near future, india thinks of you and your troops all the time.' To this I sent the following reply ; — ' Profoundly touched by Your Excellency's gracious and inspiring message which I have published to the troops. On the 26th January when things looked black I issued the following order to the garrison ;— ' Our duty stands out pVm and simple. It is our duty to the Empire, to our beloved King and Country to stand here and hold up the Turkish advance as we have been doing since the 4th December, and with the help of all, heart and soul with me together, we will make this defence to be remembered in history as a glorious one. Let us all remember the defence of Plevna. We shall succeed, mark my words, but save your ammunition as if it were gold.' Your Excellency ; I have received messages from Indian officers to tell me that they are with me to their last breath. Another reason w hich determined me to make my stand at Kut was so as not to lose any of the fruits of my victory at Kut al-Amarah last September which consolidated the Basrah Vilayet. In the name of the 6th Division I thank your Excellency with all mv heart 3 February 5M.—A telegram from General Headquarters informs me of the contemplated despatch of the 13th British Division to Mesopotamia. Scurvy had now appeared amongst Indian troops. On the 6th February, a large column of infantry and a field battery were observed moving east on the right bank from the Hai Bridge towards Es Sinn. The Corps Commander now apprised me of his project of advance up the right bank by night march, on the arrival of sufficient reinforcements, which he calculated would be about the middle of this month. General Aylmer discussed various plans for my co-operation with him to the fullest extent bossible in the numerous contingencies which might arise. February yth. —I acquainted the Corps Commander with the measures I had already taken and w r ould take to secure the co-operation he desired dealing with questions of supplies to be placed on the right bank, transfer of troops, guns etc., and the ways and means to effect this. ' 1 expressed surprise at the small maximum force with which he proposed to execute his task, given fact that he had already fought two indecisive actions and suffered a reverse, and the consequent effect on the Indian troops ; and ^ suggested that if he had any doubt as to the result it would be wiser to wait and unite all his forces before advancing, specially indicating the importance of awaiting the presence of the r3th British Division. I emphasised that if the Russian success at Erze ru m would change Armenia into Turkey's principal theatre, no more reinforcements would be likely to come to the secondary theatre—Mesopotamia,February 8th. —I now framed various projects for my co-operation with General Aylmer's force from all points of view and by either bank ; and had them secretly communicated to my Brigadiers and senior Administrative Officers. It being reported to me by the 30th Infantry Brigade Commander that the Afridis of the 24th Punjabis are dissuading other Mohammedan troops from eating horse flesh, which is so essential in combating scurvy, I wired to the Corps Commander and General Headquarters representing the advisability of inducing the Moulvi of Delhi and the leading Granthis and Pandits to address a message to co-religionists and advise them to eat horse flesh in the exceptional circum stances. On the nth Februarv at 9-30 P.M., the enemy's guns opened fire and there was a burst of musketry which lasted for about live minutes. This was done ap parently to frighten my Arab working parties engaged in raising dykes to keep the coming floods out of the town. On the 13th February a German monoplane came over the town and dis charged five bombs in the morning and ten more ia the evening in the two trips he made. Several of the bombs feil close to my Headquarters. I asked the Corps Commander to let his aeroplanes bomb the Turkish main camp and hangars in retaliation. Enemy again opened fire on the town at 9-30 P.M., with his guns and there was a sharp burst of musketry in front of the woolpress village and our north west section. On the 14th February the German monoplane sailed over Kut at 5-30 P.M.&gt; and discharged five bombs without result. At 9-30 P.M., the enemy's guns fired 30 to 40 shells into the town. On the 15th February the enemy's guns, including a newly arrived quick- firing battery, opened on the town and fort at 5-45 P.M., and were at once engag ed by ours, but we are absolutely 'out gunned ' by the enemy, and there is no doubt of it, our 5 inch guns are utterly out of date and their rate of fire pain fully slow—the enemy's 12 c.m. guns getting off rounds three times as quickly. So painfully slow are the heavy guns here—about one round in ten minutes — that I generally see no use in firing them. My experience of them in four opera tions I have conducted out here is a fairly wide one and I will never take these useless guns anywhere where I may command in the future as they are only fit for the scrap-heap. On the 16th February the following message from the King-Emperor to me, transmitted through Sir Percy Lake, was communicated in a special order to all ranks ;— ' I together with all your fellow countrymen continue to follow with admi ration the gallant fighting of your troops under your command against great odds and every possible effort is being made to sup port your splendid resistance.' My answer to the Secretary of State was as follows:-^ ' It is hard for me to express by words how profoundly touched and inspirited all ranks of my command have been by His Majesty's message. On behalf of my command, that is to say Royal Naval Detachment, the 6th Poona Division all ranks of the British and Indian units composing it and of the troops attached, including Territorials, I hope you will convey to His Majesty that the know ledge that we have gained the praise of our beloved Sovereign and our fellow countrymen will be our sheet anchor in this de fence.' ijth February. —The taking of Erzerum by the Russians was the pleasing news announced by General Baratoff in a telegram to me this morning from Kasvin. igth February. — The German monoplane made two trips over Kut tow r n this afternoon discharging bombs on each occasion and killing two or three Arabs.33 6 P M 0 'ctr^!Z? r *'Z7 W0 L 0f the f nem y' s monoplanes appeared over Kut about M *» dro PP&gt;ng eight bombs mostly in the mule lines. shells conlcfht'1 7 a.m ., heavy gun f.re was heard to eastward and ' ^ Seen bU ^ t,n ^- 1 k ept my troops all day in readiness to e'xceot a smatl rT. 0p P 0 k rtunit y offe t red but no movement of the Turks showed of Rn n^nn f? h t. 0 f f? 0 ''fantry which proceeded from camp S.

My reply to Corps Commander (repeated to G. H. Q.) was as follows : — ' I told hirn 1 should endeavour to co-operate with two brigades and a four gun Field battery, which was largest maximum force I dare take out of Kut, leaving two remaining brigades as smallest mimimum force to hold Kut. I determined that I would commence to cross as soon as I could see the turning attack of General Aylmer coming round to south of Dujailah Redoubt, for otherwise, if the turning attack did not materialise and General Aylmer was repulsed, my'sortie force crossing, and portion that had already crossed, would 'be annihilated as there would be no means of retreat. The enemy 'lad guns behind trenches on the right bank opposite my only possible crossing place where flying bridges could work, and infantry in the trenches. The operation would take some ei^ht hours to accomplish. fe General Aylmer knew all the difficulties and delays of my crossing which were so great as to render ihe likelihood of my co-operation becoming of little use. Gene al Aylmer estimated the enemy in the Es Sinn position in front of him at 8,000 only. On the 8th March from 5 30 A.M. I held in constant readiness the force which I intended to use in co-operation with the Corps Commander. At 7-10 A.M. the first sound of gunfire was heard in the direction of the Es Sinn Ridge and Dujailah Redoubt. About 8-30 A.M. there was a lull and flocks of sheep were being driven along the right bank towards the Mai Bridge and a good deal of transport was moving in the same direction from the Shaikh imam Musjid. At 9 A.M. a haze began to arise and by 11 a.m. observation towards Es Sinn became impossible—though the Ilai Bridge was still visible. From 2 to 4 P.M. sounds of very heavy musketry were heard with an occasional burst of gun fire. About 4 p M. a heavy bombardment of the Dujailah redoubt commenced ana lasted till nearly 5 p.m. It had been apparent to me at 11 a.m. that the attack on the Dujailah Redoubt had fa.leo, for all fire had died away for some hours ; the turning attack which was to have come round Dujailah to the southward never appeared at all, and 1 concluded that General Aylmer's^ attack on the Dujailah Redoubt must have absorbed all troops he had with him in a practically frontal attack on this Redoubt. At 13 10 P.M., I received a message from General Aylmer to the effect that enemy were sending their reserve from Magasis towards Dujailah Redoubt which was putting up a stubborn resistance to his attack. His aeroplane reported that about a thousand men were crossing from left bank to the right bank at Ma^asis by ferry ; enemy reserves from Shumran were moving tcwards the Hai where they reported 1,500 men. He asked what my news was and what steps I was taking to co-operate. I sent General Aylmer an answer by telegraph to say that I should begin firing when I saw his turning attack developing south of Dujailah and I asked where this turning attack w T as and what was its progress. I informed him that we were watching carefully Shumran and no reserves had gone to Hai Bridge except some cavalry (about three squadrons). About 200 infantry had gone east by the left bank. On this account, about 5 P.M., I received a message from General Aylmer to say. that he had up to date failed to take the Dujaihh Redoubt but a final effort is being made at 5 P.M. At that time the haze commenced to lift and bodies of Turkish infantry were seen moving from Es Sinn ridge towards Magasis.35 A bombardment of the whole of the Turkish position commenced at 5*30 P.M. and about 5*45 3 heliograph to north west Dujailah Redoubt appeared for a moment to be calling us but we failed to establish communication. At 8-15 p.m., a heavy burst of artillery fire was visible at the Turkish camp at Magasis ; it looked as if British shells were dropping into their camp and the i urkisti gun flashes in reply could be plainly seen. I thought Aylmer's attack on Dujailah Redoubt at 5-30 p.m . mast have been successful though I was surprised not to hear from him. At 11 p.m., the Corps Commander sent me following which I received at midnight ;— ' March 8th. Enemy lost heavily to-day and it is doubtful whether they will be able to maintain their position. Will let you knovv to-morrow proposed plan which will include English Division whic 1 has arrived.' This still leaves me in doubt whether he took the Dujailah Redoubt or not, in fact by mention of a ' proposed plan ' it would appear that he is going to prepare fresh operations apart from this. March 9///.— At 9-30 A .m., following telegram from Corps Commander reached me by aeroplane ' To day's operations terminated in a gallant but unsuccessful attempt to storm the- Dujailah redoubt. Troops pushed home and carried out operation with great gallantry but the enemy was able to mass reinforcements which arriv ed from the left bank at Magasis and from Shumran and we were unable to break through. Unless the enemy retires from his present position from the right bank, which does not seem probable, we shall ba unable to maintain our selves in present pisition o.ving to lack of water, and unless the enemy evacuate the Es Sinn pomnn to night we shall be obliged to withdraw to our previous position at VVadi.' ' Casualties to-day have been heavy.' The above was followed by another message on morning of March 9th to say that his message of March 8:h comrnencing ' Enemy lost heavily to-day ' was a bogus one which had been sent as there was grave suspicion that the enemy had our cipher. General Aylmer said ne had been unable to break through to relieve me and he might have to withdraw to VVadi to-morrow but that he hoped to make another attempt before long and relieve meat an early date. Enemy had lost most severely and their counter-attacks had been repulsed. The above message had been w itten at 1 -45 A.M., March 9th, and despatched by aeroplane. I immediately took steps to kill off about 1 ,100 animals which would save grain and enable me to hold out till 15th April. APPENDIX AA. Copy of a telegram from 6th Division to General H-^ad Quirters, No. 69-246-G., dated 9th M arch 1916. ' No. I2-I228 -G and 12-1230 G. received. I hope you will convey the gratitude of myself and my command and sympathy to you and your force for their gallant efforts to relieve us. I should like to make it clear to you again, as I told you in my 6g-239-G.of March 8th, the only reserves which went east from Shumran to F.s Sinn on right bank was a regiment of cavalry which I saw leave Shumran myself and watched it cross Hai Bridge, and 2;o infantry along left bank counted by observers at fort as they passed well within sight. That you did not execute projected turning manoeuvre round south of Dujailah with four out of six brigades which I had to see appear before I committed my sorry force to crossing Tigris, was due I suppose to your air\ 36 reconnaissance report of the approach of reserves from Shumran ; many mistakes are made in this way by young ofiicers observing from air craft up at a great height. In this country it is diffcult to judge numbers and difference from cattle, in the field by experienced officers, as it is, let alone extra height of 4,000 feet up. Such a mistake delayed me one day during my advance on Ctesiphon, as Kemball can tell you. More follows. ' APPENDIX BB. Copy of a telegram from 6th Division, to Corps and G. H. Q., No. 69-247-G., dated 9th March 1916. ' In continuation of my 69-246- G. Up to 11 -30 A.M., on March (8th ?) then practically no reserves from Shumran passed Hai on right bank or our fort on left bank going east. At that hour thick haze shrouded whole country. If they left Shumran after 11 -30 A.M., they could not possibly have reached your field of battle in time to take part in it. 1 am now going to kill off animals to enable us to continue our task of holding up Turkish advance at Kut which we have done now for three months. By killing off nearly 1 ico animals at once and reducing British troops loaf from 12 to 10 oz. and Indian tioops to 10 oz. flour meal and 4 oz. barley for paichirg per day 1 can make my present stock of barley last till roughly April 7th, As I have told you however I am entirely dependent on my mills the stones and engine of which keep giving trouble and anxiety and require careful nursing by that able officer Winfield Smith R. F. C. who manages all this for me. British troops will have to exist entirely on bread and meat and Indian troops on meal, parched barley and ghee, and other articles of rations will be finished even on a reduced scale by the 15th March. More follows. ' AVPENDIX CC. Copy of a te'egram from 6 h Division to Corps and G H. Q. No, 69-248^ , dated 5th March 1916. Continuation of 69-247 -G. Of tl o-&gt;e 1 100 animals I am killing I mav say that if put up down in India now they would require six months rest before being able to do a hard day's work. I propose keeping about 13CO animals of which about 900 will be required for meat up to April 7th but those remaining alive on that date will be utterly incapable of work. My troops are then ready to live on short rations, it is their plain duty to do so but they will become weak I expect and desertions among Indian troops will increase. But I hope next effort will be with such a maximum force as will make an absolute certainty of success. This suspense is very hard to bear. It breaks down health and depresses. To all men uncertainty is intolerable. Tuice now I have promised the men that relief was at hand. I ought to be relieved before April 7th unless there is truth in the Turkish peace proposals mentioned in Reuters in which cafe our relief may possibly settle itself in this way or unless Baratoff can be induced to press his advance on Khanikin and seriously menace Baghdad which might relieve me automatically. But want of ransport I take it is great difficulty. Still he should be asked to help, 1 think. Addressed Corps repeated G. H. Q.' The officers and troops of the 6th Division and those attached, including the detachment of the Royal Navy under Sub-Lieutenant L. Tudway, R. N.'37 01 have distinguished themselves as usual in these operations. It is impossible that any expression of mine can convey to you the sense which I entertain of their gallantry, tenacity and patient endurance during the defence of Kut. The Gunboat ' Sumana 'and the four horse-boats in wh : ch the 4'f naval guns were mounted have been constantly shelled throughout the siege by night and by day there being no cover for them ; often the *' Sumana ' has been hulled and her upper works shell-swept and riddled by rifle bullets. These brave and hardy seamen, mostly reservists I believe, have maintained nobly the great traditions of the Royal Navy. The list of killed and wounded during the siege amounting to 2,568 to date indicates sufficiently the disadvantages of an entrenched camp which has to be created and dug under the enemy's tire compared with the cover and shelter from fire offered by a fortress. I am deeply indebted to Major-General Sir C. J. Melliss, V.C., K.C.B., and Major-General W. S. Delamain, C.B. D.S.O , just as much as I have been to these two able soldiers throughout the Ctesiphon operations. They have, during the defence of Kut conducted alternately the defence of the north-west section of my defence. I have sufficiently indicated my opinion of the work of General Melliss in my Ctesiphon operations report and his brilliant record in the Indian Army requires no further praise from me. He should be given a division as soon as possible if I may suggest it. As for General Delamain, from the moment I took over command of the 6th Division in Mesopotamia just after the battle of Shaiba I have had implicit reli ance in his judgment, energy and sterling qualities as a leader of men. In my report on the battle of Kut-al-Amarah in September last I said that it was for this reason I gave him the command of the turning manoeuvre. 1 must also record the services of Brigadier-General \V. G. Hamilton, C. B , D. S. O., whose zone of defence was the town and the south-west, south and south-east fronts of my defence, and, as always, he has conducted his com mand to my.entire satisfaction, as he has done throughout the Ctesiphon oper ations. He was wounded but not dangerously and is now recovering. I have recommended him for promotion to Major-General. It is also my duty to signalise the services of Brigadier-General F. A. Hoghton, who has conducted throughout the defence of Kut, the defence of the north-east section of my defence in an able and judicious manner. Up to date, vtz., 10th March, his section of the defence has had I may say, the burden of the fighting as the seizure of the fort has always been the enemy's main objective. I have been greatly indebted to General Hoghton throughout our continuous operations since leaving Amarah last year. In this connection I beg to me.ition the great service rendered by Lieute nant Colonel W. H. Brown, Commanding, 103rd Mahratta Light Infantry, who conducted ably the defence of the fort and in this direction I would underline his work on the night of 24th-25th December when he ejected the Turks from the fort when they had forced their way in. I consider he should be selected for promotion to Brigadier-General. The arrangements and conduct of the artillery were judicious and effective under the directiDn of that able officer Lieutenant-Colonel H. N. St. J. Maule, R. F. A., who, owing to the absence on account of sickness of the Brigadier- General, Royal Artillery, Brigadier-General G. B. Smith, practically throughout the siege has been charged with duties of Commanding Royal Artillery after Colonel H. D. Grier, R. A., who had succeeded to the duties of C. R. A. had been wounded. Here I would again, as in my report on the Ctesiphon operations, draw attention to the continuous and able services of Colonel Grier ; the fact of his being wounded was a great loss to me. He is well fitted for the post of Com manding Royal Artillery tc the Division and hope he may be considered for it.38 Lieutenant Colonel F. A. Wllfon, R. E., has carried out the duties of Divisional Engineer Commander to my entire satisfaction. His defence arrange ments and proposals were always judicious and his arrangements in the direction of flood protection work very satisfactory. I am indebted for the assistance of Lieutenant-Colonel A. W. N. Taylor, 2-7th Gurkha Rifles, who has carried out the duties of Military Governor of Kut to ray satisfaction. To keep the Arab population of the town some 6,000 in good order and under eflicient control is not an easy task, especially as the bulk of them are with the Turks and hostile to us ; yet he has arranged to do this up to date in a very satisfactory manner. By the death of Lieutenant-Colonel M. H. Courtenay, R. G. A, from wounds inflicted by a shell. His Majesty has sustained the loss of a very gallant and good officer. Colonel U. VV. Evans, C. B., my General Staff Officer (1), has been of the greatest assistance to me throughout the siege and especially so from his knowledge of field fortifications. When Brigadier-General Hamilton was wounded, I placed Colonel Evans in temporary command of the 18th Infantry Brigade as Brigade Commander and he is now conducting this command to my entire satisfaction and has my entire confidence in such a post. I have recom mended this officer to the Commander-in-Chief for promotion to Brigadier- General. I am greatly indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel H. O. Parr who commands the 7th Rajputs ; he has most ably carried out the duties of General Staff Officer (1) during the absence of Colonel Evans on other work, and also ably performed the duties of Assistant Quartermaster General during temporary sickness of Colonel Chitty, and I consider he is an officer to be advanced in the service. He has done very well as a battalion commander in this campaign, he has aptitude, able judgment and the cheery temperament so essential for command on service He has been five times mentioned in despatches and I strongly recommend him for promotion. Colonel W. W. Chitty, Assistant Quartermaster-General, has, as usual, ably, and with his unflagging energy, assisted me throughout the siege opera tions as he has so ably done in the operations of Kut-al-Amarah last year, and in the Ctesiphon operations, and I recommend him for advancement. And in this connection I would especially mention the services of his assistant Captain VV. F. C. Gilchrist, 52nd Sikhs, an able gallant officer who, during ihe hardest part of the siege was attached by me to the Oxfordshire and Bucking hamshire Light Infantry defenders of the fort. I hope that he may be especially noted for advancement for the good of the public service. Colonel P. Hehlr, C. B., the Assistant Director of Medical Services, has, as usual, done me great service, as in the Qurnah-Amarah, Kut-al-Amarah and the Ctesiphon operations, with his accustomed energy and ability and sound knowledge of his profession. I recommend him for a special mark of favour of Government. As usual, Lieutenant-Colonel H. O. B. Browne-Mason, R. A. M. C. his assistant, has again earned my gratitude and approbation by his cheeriness and constant energy and zeal. I hope he can be marked for well deserved advancement. He has done distinguished service at Shaiba in the Qurnah Amarah operations at Kut-al-Amarah and at Ctesiphon also. Major J. H. M Davie, Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, has been of the greatest assistance to me throughout the siege. He is an able staff officer and 1 again recommend this officer to the favourable notice of the Commander-in- Chief for a decoration as he is so near promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel. Not only in his post as Deputy-Assistant -Adjutant General has he given me ample satisfaction, but I wish to signal here that throughout the Ctesiphon operations as well as in the defence of Kut he has been of great use to me in other ways For example in the Battle of Ctesiphon I used him to rally and take back to the' (ight considerable numbers of men drifting away to the rear and he did excellentS9 work in this way. During the retreat I placed him in charge of all the transport preceding the column and here again he was of the greatest value to me. I have already recommended him for the Assistant Quartermaster-Generalship tor this Division, a post for which he is well qualified. I have again to signal the excellent work and ability of Colonel A. S. R. Annesley, my Assistant Director of Supplies. I have served with many officers on service of the Army Service Corps and the Supply and Transport t orps and i can say I never met one before who had greater grasp in managing the food supply of a corps in the field. I look on his assistance as most valuable. Major E. Forbes, my Assistant Director of Transport, has worked with unceasing energy. No difficulty was too great for him. When, in order to have gram, it became necessary to destroy a great number of animals, he suggested trying the experiment of taking 800 mules off the ration list and seeing if they could be kepi alive on mule flesh and grass. He has been of greatest assistance to me throughout the operations and since leaving Amarah last year. I have again to recommend the unflagging energies of Captain B. G. Peel my General Staff Officer (2), throughout the siege. I have also to recommend the able service of Captain VV. E. T. Morland, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, my General Staff Officer (3) throughout the siege. He has done most strenuous and able work throughout the operations of last year; very able and possessed of great energy, I recom mend him for promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel in the interest of the service. Captain H. S. Cardew, 39th Gharwal Rifles, Commanding No. 34 Divisional Signal Company, has done good work as usual and I recommend him for promo tion. Sub-Lieutenant Tudway, R.N., Commanding detachment of Royal Navy. An excellent and zealous young officer. He has already been decorated for the Ctesiphon operations and he has my entire confidence as an able and gallant officer. I strongly recommend him for advancement. I beg to mention to your favourable notice the services of my Aide-de-Camp, Lieutenant H. A. Clifton, 8th Battalion, Kast Surrey Regiment, who has been with me throughout the retirement from Ctesiphon and defence of Kut and who is a particularly hardworking and promising young officer. Services of the following Commanding Officers during the defence of Kut Lieutenant-Colonel E. A. E. Lethbridge.

B. Powell, Commanding 2-7th Gurkha Rifles.—Has throughout the siege inspired his Brigade Commander and myself with great confidence in himself and his battalion. Lieutenant-Colonel R.

Matthews, R. E., Commanding 23nd Field Companv, 3rd Sappers and Miners.—Is an able officer recommended for the Victoria Cross. I would particularly draw attention to th3 conspicuous fine conduct of the above mentioned units and also the yth Rajputs, 103rd Mahratta Light Infantry and 120th Infantry throughout the defence of Kut of which they may well be called the sheet anchor. As regards the Commanding Officers of other units, I have thoroughly endorsed the opinions of their Brigade Commanders. The Officers Commanding the Batteries of Royal Artillery whose work has been in accordance with the traditions of the Royal Regiment are mentioned under the report of the Commanding Royal Artillery and endorsed by me. I am indeed deeply indebted to Captain S. C. Winfield Smith, 3rd Battalion, East Surrey Regiment, Flight Commander of the Royal ITying Corps, than whom no one deserves more credit in the defence of Kut, for he has managed the mills for grinding the grain and managed the machinery for the same with skill and ability and great resource. He is in addition a very brave and gallant officer, a daring and expert pilot and on the whole one of the most useful all round officers I have ever met. My recommendations in the case of officers, non-commissioned officers and men who have been brought to my notice by subordinate commanders will follow as soon as possible.
