They were anxious to fulfil their obligations to the Company but wanted time to collect the revenues due to them to enable them to establish their authority over the tribes inhabiting the areas in which the Company are interested. It was clear that they are not yet in a position to guarantee the security of the Company*s personnel in the Wadi el Qaur, where Sultan bin Salim’s guards are still stationed. Shaikh Saqr is, however, only awaiting H.M.G’s recognition and the accumulation of some revenue before removing Sultan bin Salim’s men from Manai and the Wadi el Qaur; and I am confident that he will be able to facilitate the Company's work next season. 3.

Felly, Esquire, O.B.E., Political Agent, BAHRAIN. 42 ft /tsf COPY Pius cut Dated the 12th May,1948« Dear Stchart, 1 have already given you verbally full details regarding my talks with the Sultan during the last few days and am writing this letter in confirmation,, 2. I came here with the intention of letting the Sultan know what I had been doing in BARAIMI* I told him that I had negotiated with the AL BU SHAMIS and BU KHURAIBAN (NA»IM) to allow the Company to explore their lands. I told his Highness that I had paid these two tribes and had taken from them letters confirming their understanding that the Company would be allowed to explore for 3 years extendable at the Company^ option to 5 years and stipulating the sum which would be paid to the sheikhs yearly in token of their agreement. I explained that no replies had been given by me to the Sheikhs* letters which were designed primarily to prevent them increasing their demands each year and which could be considered as receipts rather.than contracts since they were letters from one party only. 3« The Sultan was extremely perturbed by the Company's direct approach to the tribes and maintained that he had never agreed to that procedure. I explained that we had been given to understand that he would say nothing if the Company approached the tribes direct but would, of course, retain the right to object at a later date if he considered it necessary. The Sultan flatly denied that he had ever given his consent, tacit or otherwise, to such a course which he considered was in direct violation of Article 12 ( I think ) of the Concession which stipulated that the Company would enter only those areas which he declared safe. His Highness then explained that in 1939 he had informed the Company that he could and would arrange for their entry to the DHAHIRA but had been unable to agree to the use of cars. The position, he maintained, was in 1948 the same as in 1939 i.e. he could and would, if asked by the Company, arrange for their entry into the DHAHIRA. The Sultan declared that he had not been told of the Company's intentions to which he would never have agreed and he said that the misunderstanding arose because what he actually said to the Consul in 1946 was that if the Company chose to enter the DHAKIRA ( under his auspices ) by car they could do so at their own risk. He was, therefore, extremely worried about the effects of the Company's direct approach to the tribes, and he feared that the AL BU SHAMIS negotiations would tend to encourage every tribe in the DHAHIRA to assert its independence by dealing direct with us. This, then, was the position I discovered on arrival here after my first meeting with His Highness. He told me, later, that he had intended invoking the Political Resident's support to stop our work in the DHAHIRA since it violated the Concession thus demonstrating his authority to the tribes there. He would then have forced them to work with him, but, fortunately, we have avoided things coming to that pass. 4 . I have, as you know, had long talks with him every day since my arrival and we have finally agreed as follows: (a) • •••••••WatMmB - 2 - (a) ^ince I have already settled with the AL BU SHAMIS, who have not been on good terms with the Sultan for about 2 years now, the latter will not try to chastise their Sheikh, MOHAMMED BIN SALIMEEN, but will, in due course, call him in to Muscat when I have gone from BARAIMI and will take the line that he, Mohammed, has been greedy, that the Sultan when he agreed ( sic ) to the Company’s paying the Sheikhs direct a ’’sweetner” had not intended that his subjects should oppose the Company as he, Mohammed, had done., etc., etc., etc., In effect, he will show Mohammed that he had given his consent to the direct approach ( as indeed I had already told the Sheikhs in the genuine belief that that was so ) and will win him back to the fold. I have warned him against threatening or chastising Mohammed who will, I know, immediately take refuge with the AL BU FALAH. The letter Mohammed has given me will stand. (b) The Sultan is not particularly concerned about the BU KHURAIBAN and will adopt the same procedure with them. (c) The KHAWATIR, AHMED AS SALF, wrote to His Highness ( I was shown the letter ) telling him that they were his faithful subjects and that they had shot up the Christian (me). The Sultan will send for AHMED AS SALF at onee, &amp;nd tell him he is to meet me in BARAIMI and agree with me regard- ^ ing presents. SHEIKH AHMED AS SALF and indeed all the other Sheikhs will be allowed to give me letters on the same lines as I have already taken off the AL BU SHAMIS and BU KHUREIBAN. (d) The Sultan will call in UBAID BIN JUMA of the BANI KAAB at the same time as AHMED AS SALF and will give him the same instructions. (e) His Highness will instruct SHEIKH SAQR of the NA’IM in BARAIMI on the same lines as also the BANI QITTAB, BALUCH and DHANK people. The general idea is that in 8 - 10 days time these people meet me in BARAIMI and settle with me having had the Sultan’s prior orders to do so. This may all sound a bit ambitious and gives rather a different picture to what I had conceived in BARAIMI where the Sultan’s influence appeared to be so negligible. He has, however, shown me about 100 Arabic letters collected over the last 10 years or so, and many of very recent origin, in which all these people affirm their loyalty and obedience to him. I think he is right in claiming that they are his subjects and with the usual Bedou duplicity they put a different aspect on the question when at a safe distance from Muscat. The point is, however, that the Sultan is convinced that they will obey his wishes and I must give it a try.' * 333 ? - 3 - 5. I asked the Sultan whether he would open the WADI JIZZI to cars since it was the obvious route to BARAIMI from the BATINAH and was an infinitely better route for the Company to work than those from the TRUCIAL COAST over the HAZZA BAUSH or RAMLAT ANAIJ sands. He was, at first, opposed to doing so more out of pique at the course we had adopted than for any other reason I think but after much persuasion he has seen the wisdom of opening the WADI and providing the Company with a short, accessible and easy route to the interior. He has promised to do everything he can without delay and asks that the Company should assist him; I think he wants material rather than financial support as for example cement to build watch towers and gunpowder to blast the 15 yard (?) gap which blocks the WADI to motor transport. ( It is, I understand, only a short distance which requires levelling), I have informed him that I was sure the Company would assist him and that I would refer the matter to London as soon as possible. 6. I have discussed the prospects of the Company 1 s entering the HUGF area ( it is not a Wadi as shown on the Muscat Masira 1/1 million sheet North F 40 ). He suggested we should enter from JAALAN with BU ALI escort ( he is sweet with the BU ALI ) and move by camel to near MAHUT on the coast picking up rabia* ( guides ) from there from the JANABA. I remonstrated against this devious method of approach and said we would like to land at MAHUT or somewhere near, build up a base camp there for water since there is none in the HUGF area, and operate with motor transport. I said we would take as escort any one he wished. He informed me there were no important Sheikhs from whom we could obtain guards hence his suggestion to employ the BU ALI. • The Sultan is going to consider this question and has promised to let me know as soon as possible what he considers the best way would be to work that area. 7. I have explained broadly to the ^ultan the areas in which we are interested and he has offered to give me lett ers to the DURU* Shaikhs who are, theorectically, and in practice, subordinate to their TAMIMAH SHEIKH MOHAMMED BIN TINA. The Sultan suggests I contact them in due course and move with them anywhere I like in their country or in any country bordering on the sands in the S.N. corner of OMAN as long as I keep away from habitation of other tribes. This was a most welcome invitation and although he has probably little authority to offer it, I do at least know that this scheme which I had been contemplating for next winter will not meet with his opposition. I consider it can be done and have already had indirect overtures from DURU 1 . We should then obtain access to an area we are anxious to see and the Sultan assures me that none of the Big Three would object or could oppose the DURU 1 . 8. In conclusion, the Sultan 1 s reactions are interst ing. He is oil hungry but ravenously so in so far as DKOFAR is concerned. He even remarked that he hoped that DHOFAR would be able to drain all the oil from the East i.e. from OMAN 1 He grasps at every little thing that leads him to hope for results in DHOFAR and said to me ' Why dont you give up the Concession if you think there is no oil? H I told him we were doing our best and he should rely on our geologists and not pay too much attention to Sir Cyril Fox's report because the latter was not an oil geologist although probably very competent in his own line. He is happy to hear • ••••••4 hear from his WALI HAMUD in DHOFAR that our geologists were interested in certain parts of the country there and is feverishly hoping for results. this end if he could promote them there, but he has at last accepted the wisdom of promoting our work in OMAN which must inevitable increase his own influence if he plays his cards fightly. SHAKHRUT 1 S brother and representative in BARAIMI, with me and I believe his visit has been most successful in improving relations between the AL 3 U FALAH and AL BU SAID. Their interests in so far as oil is concerned in the DHAKIRA and HAFIT area are identical and, in fact, are so in other directions also. I have done my best to bring the two parties together and I think we should all be n on the same road ' now.^ There is still a lingering mutual suspicion but I hope it will gradually disappear and the two families will pull together to everybody f s advantage. which you may care to send to the Political Resident and copies are being sent to Lermitte in Bahrain-and Brigadier Longrigg in London.

I assisted him by informing Himriyahtha.t I considered it most likely that H.M.G. would regard Hirariyah as a fief of Sharjah, and that in such a case the Oil Company would not deal direct with him. I advised him to settle with the Shaikh of Sharjah. Hirariyah then volunteered to accept my arbitration if he could not reach agreement with Sharjah himself. 3 .

Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., Political Agent, ^ Bahrain. BAPT 1 A ’4Dear Jackson -A1 Muataradh June 194# The position regarding my work down herejas it was when i returned about mid-May is explained in my letter of the 12th May to Stobart a copy of which I sent you, 2 ) I have since then been unable to come to any agreement with Ahmed al Saif of the Khawatir because the Sultan detained him until the 4th June in Muscat, The only information about the result of the Sultan T s efforts that I have received is contained^the telegram No C /196 of the 5th June from the Political Agent,Muscat from which I draw the following inclusions which may or may not be correct. Unless the Sultan has bribed Ahmed Al Saif very heavily, I do not believe he will be unwilling to meet me; he may be unwilling to meet me in Baraimi itself and might wish me to go to Hafit. Again,subject to the same proviso as above, it is wishful thinking to suggest that Ahmed al Saif will require the geologists to work from Muscat territory; that is what the Sultan wishes and seems to have reverted to in spite of the fact that I explained at some length during my recent visit that we could not enter the Hafit or Baraimi area from Muscat territory by car until he opened up the Wadi Jizzi. The Sultan is well aware that he would be placing very serious restrictions on our operations if we were forced to operate from Muscat territory before that were done* If Ahmed al Saif jias been bought over to the Sultan ! s side, it means that there is going tojtrouble amongst the Naim and Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan has already told me that he would at once stir up every conceivable diffic ulty not stopping short of fighting if Al Saif went over to Saiyyid Said,That,then, is the position as I see it and,to put it bluntly, the Sultan has either succeeded in queering his own pitch or ours. The Sultan's reference to Article (ii) of the Treaty is not understood by me butjhis concern not to become involved in any responsibility for the safety of foreigners is merely part of his well-known mania on that subject asis very well demonstrated in Dhofar to this day; I dont think it has any real significance. 3) Moha,mmed bin Ali bin Awwad of Hafit was due to arrive in Baraimi the hay after I left and I deliberately avoided him so as to give the Sultan a chance of seeing what he could do on his own; I could easi: ^have settled with him myself I am quite certain. ^ 4) Regarding the Bani Kaab. I did not realise until I went to Muscat that the Sultan had any serious pretensions to those people and I said nothing when he stated he would call Shaikh Obaid to Muscat and tell him to settle with me. The latter came into Baeaimi about ten days ago and I asked him if he had had a letter from the Sultan. He admitted he had and said he would n not be leaving for Muscat for some days. I told him the Sultan wished nin to agree with the company to which he replied at once that,while .be was prepared to discuss thefts of camels etc, he was not prepared to talk about oil with the Sultan since it did not concern the latter. It would have been a physical impossibility for Obaid to have returned from Muscat in time for me to settle with him before I left Baraimi and unless I could bring in some other largish tribe before leaving 1 would have been unable to have told the company that there was sufficie work for this next winter; I felt justified,therefore, in settlingwith the Bani Kaab before Obaid had received his orders from His Highness (which he would not have accepted). To the best of my knowledge the Bani Kaab are a long way from being considered as Kuscat subjects and if he raises any objection the point would 10b then be at issue; if a decision were adverse to Saiyyid Said it woul have unfortunate repercussions everywhere. 5) The A1 Bu Shamis are squabbling offer the proceeds of the money they will receive from the company and I quite expected them to do s&lt; so. It caused me some trouble because I was unable to move south to Suneinah which was my original plan. I am not particularly concerned about this domestic argument and I think Shaikh Zaid and Bin Rahmah will settle it all right but the Hamasah people will come out of it with very little; to my mind they deserve no more for many reasons and they are already intriguing with Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan. 6 ) There now remains the Naim tribe less the Bu Khureiban who have come in. Shaikh Saqr was extremely agitated when the news reached him that the Bani Kaab had agreed with me and I knew he would be. He has been a twice-daily visitor every day since and claims to be able to answer for all the Naim including Ahmed al Saif,and the Al Bu Shamis! His self-delusion is unlimited and on one occasion when I remarked that it might be better for him to agree with the company before Shaikh Suleiman bin Hamir succeeded in seizing Dhank as he very nearly did last year he told me that Shaikh Suleiman was really afraid of him and that he was continu ally being approached by all the Ghafiri tribes to evict Suleiman from Ibri ! A Duru T shaikh was in Baraimi the other day and I had a long talk with him during which he told me that Shaikh Saqr hadV instructed him to refer any approach made by the company to them to him and that he would answer on their behalf; I gathered that he was left under few delusions what the DuruS answer was to that proposition ! Shaikh Saqr is remarkably like the Sultan in appearance and is of exactly the same stature; they are similar im many other respects one being that they both seldom ever move out of their residences. They were born within a few weeks of each other and I have heard many of the bedou commenting on the extraordinary resemblance in evpyy way. 7) Humeid bin Abdur Rahman is causing me some concern. -^His recent refusal to allow the company's motors to move on the road is all part of his intention to discomfort the company and he is being encouraged by the Hamasah A1 Bu Sharais. He is intriguing against Bin Rahmah and trying to cause trouble with the Aulad Ali He owns a few date gardens in Suneinah and makes them the excuse for visiting that place. I understand he has been told that he is a dependent of Sharjah but,because he is a potential danger to our work down there, would you consider telling him direct yourself that if he does not mend his ways you will write to Shaikh Shakhbut and n Rahmah asking them to forbid his entry into their lands. This suggestion.emanates from Shaikh Zaid who believes it would put a stop to his activities and who is very willing to help us because he also does not want any outside interference in these parts. I hope you will agree to this suggestion because this man is definitely a nuisance and has no right to cause trouble in Oman. l '*c~*Li* a q £ Ic^Ju *CONFIDENTIAL. POLITICAL AGENCY.

The survey party*s camp has been set up about six miles south west of Jabal Ali and the Shaikhs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi have supplied the necessary guards. Jackson has informed me that Shaikh Rashid bin Sai*d of Dubai showed much reluctance to agree to the employment of Abu Dhabi guards at the Camp and in protest, tried to withdraw the guards he has supplied. This, of course, was due to the bad advice he had been receiving from mischief-makers in Dubai. 3. The Oil Company*s ship bringing the seismic instruments fitted on to heavy vehicles is expected to arrive at Umm al Qaiwain shortly and the survey party will also be arriving after which survey work will commence. 4.

On the last occasion we used this camp site we did not actually bring Abu Dhabi guards until the survey operations started. Dubai subjects were used for the purpose of guarding the camp until the work started. On this occasion however because I realized that both sides particu larly Shakhbut are very touchy on this boundary question I considered it advisable to start off with guards from both sides. Up to the present I have received neither guards nor a reply from Shakhbut, but this may be due to a mechanical breakdown of the vehicle sent for the purpose. Two guards were supplied at once by Rashid bin Seid though he protested that he did not admit Abu Dhabi 1 s right to send guards to that area. It is unfortunate that the Residency Agent is at present absent in Bahrain, for I feel sure that he would have been good enough to write himself to both Rulers and explain the situation. As it was, though I should have prefe rred to await his return, Read was quite rightly most anxious to get on with his job. As you are aware I had only discussed this question of guards verbally with the Residency Agent and had intended when the time came to put it in writing. In the circumstances I feel sure he will excuse my using his name in paragraph two of my abovementioned letters on the strength of his verbal advice only. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Residency Agent. Yours sincerely, B.H. Lermitte, Esq., Bahrain. Sd./- H.M. Jackson.DB/PL/17 Dubai, 29th Oct, 1948.

My messengers reported to me about the agressions done by the Beni Qitab against the Company. I resent this action and brought it to the notice of Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaiding who is responsible for anything done by or against them. Those who committed this act are Bin Ghidyair Hamad and Bin Hashil Sultan. I have asked him for their axplanation. I liked to let ybu know about it. Usual Ending.“'N CONFIDENTIAL. BRITISH AGENCY, SHARJAH. D.O.No.1075-0630 THE 15th December 1948. Foilwing our being held up by the Beni Qitab on the 7th December, two Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited^ trucks on their way from Dubai to Buraimi were held up near Faiyah pass in similar circumstances on the 10th December. You will remember that on the first occasion, Bird warned the Beni Qitab of the return of these vehicles and there can consequently be no excuse of mistaken identity. The Beni Qitab who were responsible for this hold-up informed the drivers that they would no longer obey the orders of the Shaikh of Sharjah or of Muhammad bin Ali regarding facilitating the work of the Company, and demanded money. Upon payment of -/-rcn'* Rs. 10/- the vehicles were allowed to proceed. They returned to Dubai via Abu Dhabi. 2. On the 14th December, I called Muhammad bin Ali to the Agency and protested to him about the two incidents and pointed out to him that not only were the hold-ups a dis grace in themselves, but were also in direct violation of the Agreement given by him in February, 1947, to the Shaikh Sharjah (vide Political Officer, Trucial Coast*s express letter No.C/230-0630 of (20th February, 1947, and enclosure), ftnidst the usual empty protestations of goodwill and good intentions towards both the Government and the Company, he said that the Beni Qitab had not received sufficient money from Sharjah and that in consequence individuals were liable to cause sporadic incidents such as those which I had described. He said he was being pressed for more money. I warned him against trying to slide out of his responsibilities in this way y in particular, as he had formally agreed to assist the C.J.

The Shaikh of Sharjah was sent for and the terms of the 1947 Agreement read over to both parties* I pointed out to Muhammad bin Ali that whereas the Shaikh of Sharjah had fulfill ed all that he had promised, (even the former had to admit to having received two separate payment of fis.15,000/-) the Beni Qitab, on the other hand, not only hampered the Company^ operation but had also offered a further insult to H.M*G. by the incident of 7th December* I warned him against attempting further hold-ups of a similar nature. 4 , in this matter the Shaikh of Sharjah has kept his word and the most that can be said against him is that he has been lamentably weak, as, of course, was to be expected. I consider that we should avoid any actibn which might weaken his position visa vis the Beni Qitab, e.g., by suggesting he should make any further payments to them or that the Company should make direct payments to them. Any money paid at this stage would only justify and confirm the Beni Qitab»s recent attitude and would breed more exorbitant demands in future. With this, both Bird and Jackson agree. The present incidents are obiously a try- on to get anything, even as little as RslO/- if it is to be had, the original payments by Sharjah to Muhammad bin Ali probably not having gone much further than the recipient and his immediate circle and the money being by now squandered, Muhammad bin Ali is under pressure for more. 5 . it is difficult to predict whether my protest will have any effect. Meanwhile Jackson will keep me informed of any further hold-ups involving the Company^ vehicles. At a!3 events, there does not seem much more to be done for the time being.S.O.Nc.C/R-272 CONFIDENTIAL POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 20th December, 1948 Dear Sir Rupert, x v ' ; I enclose a copy of a letter from Stofcart about a further hold-up in the Sharjah Agency area. The’first occasion’ to which he refers is when Bird, Stobart, myself, and Jassim were returning from Buraimi on the 8th December. After we had crossed Ramlat Anaij, we entered ^ low sand dune country. We were distributed in two Chevrolet ’pick-ups’ and a Dodge ’power-wagon* owned by P.C.L. The first car, in which Stobart was, stopped at the sound of a shot^and Bird and I pulled up in the second car behind it. Two more shots were fired, the last of which sounded rather near. We could see the heads of tribesmen behind the dunes on both sides of the road. The Naim ’Dalil’ went towards them shouting that he was of the company of Saqr bin Sultan, one of the Naim Shaikhs, but this did no good at all and only provoked the I-eni Qitab (as they turned out to be) to volleys of excited shouting. One of them then came forward unarmed and Bird and I went with him to the main body of the others. They said that they were ’at war’ with the %im because the latter had stolen some five days ago some of their camels and that they believed that the cars belonged to Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, who does actually own one C'T. After hearing from Bird that the cars were belonging to the Company they allowed them to proceed. Unfortunately, I think, Jassim, who came up later in the Dodge, gave their intermediary Rs.10/-.

(228/7/48) \ In my monthly letter for November^ I stated that it was hoped that Petroleum Concessions Limited would be able to carry out their current season*s programme of exploration in Buraimi and the Dhahirah without trouble to themselves and without treading on the Sultan*s toes. Unfortunately this hope now appears unlikely to be fulfilled, as two days after I left Muscat, the Sultan wrote to Bird stating that he considered that the Company*s work in Buraimi should be postponed this season. The Sultan gave no reason in his letter. I have discussed the situation with Lermitte and Bird who consider it probable th a t the Sultan has received some unsatisfactory letter from Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the Na*im. All the important Shaikhs of the area concerned have been to see the Sultan, and assured him of their loyalty, except Shaikh Saqr, who has been hesitating and now apparently refused to come in. Bird hoped to go and see the Sultan in December and if possible take Saqr with him, but has been compelled to postpone his visit on account of illness. He now hopes to visit Muscat in January for a talk with the Sultan, and it remains to be seen whether Saqr will also go there or not. 2. While I was discussing this subject with Lermitte and Bird, they stated that even if some satisfactory arrangement were reached with the Sultan and Saqr this year, the state of the country was such that they saw little prospect of being able to carry out continued operations in it over a number of years unless they were supported by some kind of forces., There have recently been two cases of the shooting up of Government officers or oil company personnel in the neighbourhood, though the incidents in both cases were more in the nature of demonstrations and there does not appear to have been any serious attempt to kill. Lermitte said he considered that a mobile force of about 50 men locally recruited from the tribes, in the same manner as the Arab Legion in Transjordan, would be sufficient for the purpose, provided they had officer in charge of them. I replied that I thought it might be difficult to obtain Government approval, except perhaps after a long delay, for a proposal of this nature, even though Government were admittedly very much interested in the development of oil in the area, and I also pointed out that there were objections to the employment of a Government force in the Sultan*s territory, I suggested therefore, that the Company should raise and train its own force of guards with the Sultan s consent. Lermitte welcomed this proposal, and Bird intends to consult B.A.B. Burrows, Esquire, Foreign Office, LONDON./ m —! © 2 consult the Sultan tentatively regarding it during his forthcoming visit to Muscat. I should be grateful for an assurance that no objection is seen to the suggestion I have made to Lermitte, so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned. Lermitte informed me that the Iraq Petroleum Company used to pay for the Arab Legion in Transjordan, and it would appear to me that from the point of His Majesty's Government, it is preferable both on political and financial grounds that the Company should raise a small tribal force of their own in the Sultan's territory, provided he agrees, rather than rely on a Government force.

Dated 31st January, 1949 Reference to previous correspondence: Description of enclosureConfidential . PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 19th March, 1949. (35/9/49) In paragraph 2 of my semi-official letter (35/3/49) of the 25th January I reported that the Sultan had agreed that Petroleum Concessions Limited should send their geological party into the Buraimi area at once and that Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the Na'im should be ignored. 2. The party in due course travelled to the Buraimi area from the Batinah Coast by the Wadi al Jizzi. They were fired at by a solitary sniper in the Wadi but sustained no casualities. When they reached Buraimi, the Na*im openly stated that they did not recognise the Sultan's authority and demanded that the Company should enter into a separate agreement with them. The Al bu Shamis subsequently adopted the same attitude. The party therefore withdrew to Sharjah, and Bird, its leader has left for the United Kingdom. 3. We cannot in my opinion connive at this flouting of the Sultan's authority by encouraging the company to enter into separate agreements with the tribes concerned, nor can we compel the tribes to submit to the Sultan's authority. We must, I think, advise the company to be patient and hope that the tribes in due course will knew realise that it will pay them better to work with the Sultan than against him. B.A.B.

The following issues are covered within the file:numerous incidents of resistance from local Bedouin inhabitants, usually triggered by transgression of tribal boundaries, particularly from the Beni Qitab, Manasir, and Naim [Āl Na‘īm] tribes;tribal and territorial allegiances that impacted on the work of the surveyors, and the efforts to secure access to survey areas for the company from the interested parties.Folios 69-73 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Na'īm (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Beni Qitab (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Buraimi</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geological surveying</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Dubai</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Sharjah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000131#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
