The letter and enclosure are Jones’s response to the Government’s enquiry into why Jones took the action he did, with the explanation that negotiations between Britain and Persia risked further complication with the affair. Jones also discusses the extent of the slave trade between Africa and the Gulf, and states his belief that the treaty with the Imam of Muscat [Sa‘id bin Sulṭān] is a ‘dead letter’.The enclosure is the translation of a letter (folio 282) from Jones to the British Agent at Muscat, dated 15 October 1856, a covering letter, the original of which included correspondence concerning the slave trade from the Joasmee [Qāsimī] chief [Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024066926.0x00005a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
