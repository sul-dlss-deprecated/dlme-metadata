SIMLA: PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT MONOTYPE PRESS 1917.INTRODUCTION. The Gazetteer of Arabia was originally intended to deal with the whole of Arabia south of a line drawn from the head of the Gulf of 'Aqabah, through Ma'an, to Abu Kamal on the Euphrates, and to include the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats. Before the MSS. had been completed, however, it Was decided to postpone the publica tion of the work. The accompanying volumes therefore merely contain as much of the MSS. as was ready at the time. The con tents have not been checked.CONFIDENTIAL. GAZETTEER OF ARABIA. VOLUME L A A^AIWIJ— A Nahiyah ^nd class) of the Jazirali '{q. v.) Qadha of the Baghdad Wilayat.

ABB (Island)— See 'Oman {South-eastern coast of; Ghubhat Hashish), 'ABBAdAN (Island)— Also called Jazirat-al-Khidhar, from a shrine near its centre. Both of these names are in common use, though the island is always known to Europeans as 'Abbadan. It is a large and valuable island enclosed by the Karun river on the north, by the Shatt- al-'Arab on the west, by the Persian Gulf on the south, and by Bahmanshir on the east.4 ABBiDAN Its length is about 40 miles, and its width varies from about 1J miles at the middle to 12 miles near its southern end. The centre is mostly desert, but the margins adjoining the rivers, as far as creeks extend inland, are cultivated and planted with dates : much land is now being reclaimed in the Ma'amarah neighbourhood near the south end. A submarine prolongation of the island into the Persian Gulf forms the great reef called Maraqqat 'Abbadan. The inhabitants of 'Abbadan are almost all Ka'ab Arabs,, of the Dris division of the tribe, and those in the southern part of the island nearly all belong to the Nassar sub-division. A considerable tract in the north-eastern comer of the island is known by the name of Maharzi; its limits are at Shakhat-al-Hayak on the northern, and at Huz 'Umar on the eastern shore of the island. The shrine of Khidhar stands a little nearer to the north than to the south end of the island, about 2 miles from the Shatt-al-'Arab and 1 mile from the Bahmanshlr 5 it is largely visited by the Shi'ahs of the surrounding districts.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company''s Refinery. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Refinery is situated on the western shore of 'Abbadan Island at a distance of about 9 miles by river below Muhammareh, and between the villages of Baraim and Bawairdeh, The site is some 1,370 Persian Jan65 in extent, the land being the property of the Shaikh£) ABBlDlN 9 of Muhammareh. There is approximately 2,000 yards of foreshore along the Shatt-al- 5 Arab. The original site, about a square mile in extent, was acquired on long lease in May, 1909, since when the Company has, in order to accommodate the very considerable extensions necessary to enable them to meet their fuel oil contracts with the Admiralty, recently acquired the additional ground. The British Government are interested in the company to the extent of about 50%, Drilling was first commenced at Chia Surkh, a spot some 14 miles north-east of Qasr-i- Shirln; later, operations were transferred to the neighbourhood of Ram Hurmuz, and finally, the present field of Maidan-i-Naftun, 25 miles east of Shushtar, was tested. During the great war the Qasr-i-Shirln field had temporarily to be abandoned. Early in 1910 building operations on 'Abbadan Island were begun, and plant, tankage, etc., for a throughput of 2,000,000 gallons of crude oil monthly were sent out. This figure was almost immediately increased to 4 million gallons, and now stands at from six to seven and a half million gallons dependent upon the particular process adopted, such being again dependent upon the requirements of the various oil markets. Petrol, kerosine, and Admiralty Fuel, are the main products manufactured from the crude oil. With the except on of the oil (chiefly kerosine) required for the local Persian and Turkish- Arabian markets, these products are shipped abroad and for this purpose some 5 tank steamers monthly call at 'Abbadan, Where a steamer's draft exceeds 18| feet the balance of her cargo after loading to the above noted depth is lightered to her below the Fao Bar and for such operations the Company possesses eight tank barges, varying in capacity from 500 to 1,400 tons. The crude oil is conveyed to 'Abbadan from the Company's Oil Fields at'Masjid-i- Sulaiman, in the neighbourhood of Shushtar, by a pipeline the length of which is 142 miles. This pipeline is of 6' diameter from the F elds to Wais (some 15 miles north of Ahwaz) and 8' diameter from Wais to 'Abbadan. The laying of the line was com menced in February 1910 and completed in June 1911 as also was the erection of the telephone line which follows the entire route of the pipeline. The Refinery is further connected to the Company's Muhammareh Office by telephone. Masjid-i-Sulaiman is situated some 150 miles north-north-east of Muhammareh and is some1,300 feet above sea level. The European Staff of the Anglo-Persian Oil Cbmpany there and in the neighbourhood numbers some 40 men and at Ahwaz and intermediate stations there are about 15 others. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have been drilling there since 1907 previous to which time they were working near Qasr-i-ShirJn at a place called Chia Sourkh where they stili maintain a small Field and Refinery. The oil resources of this Field (Musjid-i-Sulaiman) are considered enormous, and an unproduc tive well has never yet been drilled, Tlie climate up there is excellent, though, of course, hot n the summer, the thermometer oftern rising to 110° or to 115°, though as the at mosphere is a dry one little inconvenience is felt from it. For a couple of months during the winter (February — March) very heavy rains occur, but during the spring and autumn the weather is delightful. The place iteslf is very rocky and barren, water being scarce though the soil in the neighbouring plains and valleys is very fertile. The native inhabitants are Bakhtiari Lurs and are effectively controlled by their Khans, The field is approached by a cart road some 35 miles in length, the commencement of which is at a place called Darrah-Khazinah on the Gargar River some 14 miles south of Shushtar, Both local and Indian Labour is employed at * Abbadan, the figures in this respect for the month of December 1916 being as follows:— Indian Fitters ., .. 280 Arab or Persian Fitters ,, 72 Indian Riveters .. ..126 Do. Riveters . . 7 Indian others ,, ,, 494 Do. Others s , 2,977 900 3,055 The European staff now numbers about 90 persons. There are also some 40 China men employed as carpenters. The guarding of the Company's property at the Refinery is carried out by men fur nished by the Shaikh of Muhammareh, the Company also employ some 50 Kurdish policemen in th s respect. 'Abbadan Island would provide camping ground sufficient for a very large number of troops. Connection with the mainland is, however, difficult and entails the crossing C52(w)GSB c'10 ABB—ABD either of the Shatt-al-'Arab or the Bahmanshir. The chief advantages of the island as a camping ground are the commodious jetty, at the oil refinery, and the large amount of available space. There are also post and telegraph offices here. The temperature on the island is subject to great variation ; as much as 122° F. has been registered during the summer months, while in the cold weather it has been known to drop below freezing point.— {Murphy.)

To the northward is open country, without human inhabitants, sloping gradually down towards Adam; on the southward the Ruba'al-Khali begins immediately out side the town. The road from Manah, as it approaches Adam, passes between two arid hills of considerable elevation, namely Jabal Salakh on the west, and Jabal Madh- mar on the east. The town stands some 850 feet above sea level and has extensive date plantations, irrigated from warm springs. The principal defence is a large fort built by the Imam Ahmad, the founder of the present Al Bu Sa'idi dynasty, who, according to one tradition, was born here; it was repaired in 1869 by Saiyid 'Azzan! The population is about 3,000 souls, comprising about 300 houses of Mahariq, 150 of Al Bu Sa 'id, 30 of Hawashim and 20 of Bani Rashid. The only trade is in dates, which are exported to Mahot. The inhabitants of Adam are too remote to take much part in the faction wars of 'Oman and maintain feuds among themselves instead. ADAMAH— A halting place in northern 'Asir, about half-way between Taif and Khamis-al- Mashriq. No further information available. 'ADAN— A district in the principality of Kuwait, enclosed between the district of Qra'ah on the north, that of Shaqq on the west, that of Salu' on the south, and the sea on the east. By some authorities 'Adan is considered to include the district of Qra 'ah; if, however, we adopt the view that the two are distinct, 'Adan commences 16 miles south of Kuwait Town, immediately beyond Malah which is in Qra'ah, and extends 22 miles southwards to the Qrain hill which marks its boundary with the district of Sala'. Mi'aidnivat and SubaihTyah, mentioned below, are situated in the north-western and C52(w)GSB d18 AD AN south-western comers respectively of 'Adan, from which it appears that the breadth of the district from the sea inland varies from 10 to 20 miles. On the coast, 'Adan reaches rather further north than Malah and includes Fanaitis, mentioned further on. 'Adan is a plain of softish sand, but elevated so as to form a sort of ridge; there is very little fuel, and almost the only serviceable product is Thamam grass of bad quality. The nature of such agriculture as exists is described in the articles on Fahaihil, Faatas, Abu Halaifah and Shi'aibah, the only villages in the district. These are virtually dependencies of Kuwait Town, to which merchants and others resort in the Aiya n-ar-Rabi' or period preceding the pearling season; the inhabitants are generally unrelated to one another and have been attracted to the service of some prosperous man who has dug a well. The character of the district may be learned from the following alphabetical table of villages, wells and physical features :*— Name.

These wells were made dur ing the last decade of the 19th century. Good water at 18 feet; melons are cul tivated. See article Warah. 18 feet deep ; water good. Ras-al-QalaT'ah and the northern part of D5hat-az-Zarq, both described in the article on the Kuwait Principality, are features upon the coast of this district. The inhabitants of 'Adan, except in the fixed villages of Fahaihil, Fantas, Abu Halai- fah and Shi 'aibah, are wandering Arabs who encamp now at one well, now at another. The 'Adan district contains the only relics of antiquarian interest which have as yet been discovered in Kuwait Principality; these consist of some sarcophagi at a spot 6 miles from the Warah hill, from which that hill lies at 258° and the western most part of the Burqan hill at 214°. The tombs lie east and west and are therefore not Muhammadan.* They occupy a plot of high ground about 100 feet square. The * The direction of Mecca from these tombs is south-west. If therefore the tombs were Muhammadan they would presumably lie north-west and south-east to admit of the faces of the dead being turned towards Mecca, C. C; Si. M.22 ADA.-A.DE sarcophagi are of gypsum cement, about 5 feet long, 1 foot 8 inches broad and 2 feet deep ; the thickness of the sides is about 4 inches ; they are buried 3 to 4 feet below ground and a large number of stones of irregular shape, each about 2 cubic feet in content are piled over them. There are no inscriptions. A copper coin found there seemed to be Persian, of Baghdad mintage, belonging to the 17 th or 18th century A.D. As used in Bahrain and Hasa the term 'Adan designates the whole desert tract which extends along the coast between the Qatif Oasis and Kuwait. See Barr-al- 'Adan. 'ADAN (BARR-AL-)— A term sometimes applied by mariners to the entire coastal region between the towns of Kuwait and Qatif in Eastern Arabia. Bedouins, however, seem to be unaware of any such general application of the name ; and among them, as among the settled population of the Kuwait Principality also, the term 'Adan is only understood as referring to the small tract near Kuwait Town which is described in this Gazetteer under the title 'Adan. The shore between Kuwait and Qr.tlf is a low sandy and stony desert with occasional date-groves, owned by Bedouins, and a few isolated hills at intervals; it is fronted throughout almost its entire length by extensive reefs, which in places have a passage between them and the mainland ; the bottom of the sea in many parts consists of white clay, and the water in consequence is not generally so clear as it is further to the south. The pearl banks decrease in number off this coast, and, though there are some small pearl fisheries further to the northwards, they may be said to end near Abu 'Ali island. The districts composing Barr-al- 'Adan are enumerated in the articles upon the Kuwait Principality and the Hasa Sanjaq, and most of them form the subject of separate articles under their own names. ADAR— A hamlet in lower Mesopotamia, situated about 6 or 7 miles north-west from Qurnah. 'ADARI ( or 'ADHARI)— A spring in Bahrain Island [q. v.), 'AD A WIN— An alternative name for the Ziyainah tribe {q. v.) of Bahrain. 'ADD (J abal) — The large islet of the group known as Jazair Suwadi (q. v.) off the Batinah coast of the 'Oman Sultanate, ADEN (PORT) — The principal seaport of the Aden Protectorate (g.v.). It is situated in Lat. 12° 45' N., Lo ig. 45° 4' E., on a pen.nsula near the entrance to ths Red Sea, anJ about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-al-Mandab. The penh.sula of Aden consists chiefly of a mass of barren and desolate volcanic rocks, extending 5 miles from east to west, and 3 from its northern shore to Ras Sanaikh, or Cape Aden, its most southerly point; it is connected with the mainland by a neck of fiat, sandy ground only a few feet high ; and its greatest elevation is Jabal Shamsham, 1,725 feet above the level of the sea. The town is built on the eastern coast, in what is probably the crater of an extinct volcano, and is surrounded by precipitous rocks that form an admirable natural defence. There are two harbours, a small one on the east protected by the island of Sirah but now partially choked with mud and only used by trading dhows and fishing boats, and the main harbour formerly called Aden Back-bay, or by the Arabs, Bandar Tawahi', on the western side of the peninsula, which at all periods of the year admits vessels drawing 29 feet. Aden was captured and annexed to British India on the 16th of January, 1839. This is the date usually accepted, though one authority gives the 20th January. From time to time additional land on the mainland has been acquired by cession or purchase. Further inland, and along the coast, all the Arab chiefs are under the politiw control of the BritishADEN 23 Government which pays them regular allowances. The area of the peninsula is only 15 square miles, but the total area of British territory is returned at 80 square miles in cluding Perim [q-v.), 5 square miles. The seaport of Aden is strongly fortified. Steam er Point lies to the west of the Crater from which it is cut off by a fortified line of steep hills that runs from Hedjuff to Has Baradli. The administration is conducted by a Political Resident, who is also the Brigade Commander, and four assistants. Water and food supplies. —The water supply of Aden is largely derived from condensa tion and is therefore limited, which perhaps causes some inconvenience, but the fact that the troops and all Europeans drink condensed water has made Aden so healthy in recent years. A little water is obtained from wells, and some from an aqueduct 7 miles long, besides an irregular supply from the old reservoirs. The estimate sanctioned for this aqueduct was Rs. 3,03,703, which sum is supposed to have included the tanks at the Isthmus. The tank cost about one and one-third lakhs. At present all food has to be imported, but as soon as there are railways Aden will be able to supply iteslf to a large extent instead of being dependent on India, Somaliland, and other countries. Climate. —-The temperature rarely rises above 100°, but May and June, September and part of October, are very trying, the dampness and comparative stillness of the air, and the low level, being the chief causes. Transport and slaughter animals. —The number of transport animals available locally are roughly as follows :—- Draught camels .. .. .. • • • • • • Pack camels .. .. .. • • • • • • ^00 Bullocks .. .. .. . • • • • • 200 Horses .. .. .. . • • • ' • • • Donkeys .. .. .. • • • • • • 1^5 With two or three weeks' notice these numbers could be largely increased. The numbers of slaughter animals immediately available on any date are of course variable, but perhaps 600 cattle and 1,100 sheep and goats may le quoted. With a week's notice another 50 cattle and 1,000 sheep could be obtained from the Hinterland. Fifteen days' supply of fresh meat for the British troops are always kept in hand, besides 25,000 tins of meat. From its admirable commercial and military position Aden early became the chief entrepot of the trade between Europe and Asia. This trade, however, on account of the discovery of the passage round the Cape of Good Hope, and the misgovernment of the native rulers, had dwindled to comparative insignificance ; and it was not until the Red Sea route was re-opened that it began to revive. Aden was then made a free port, and was chosen as one of ttai coaling stations of the Peninsular and Oriental and many other steamship companies, ^ts importance as a port of call and a coaling station has grown immensely since the opening of the Suez Canal. The amount of coa,l ordinarily kept stored at Ad.en is well over a hundred thousand tons. Aden also conducts a consider able trade with the interior of Arabia, and the e?iSt coast of Africa. The submarine cables of the Eastern Telegraph Company diverge at Aden, leading on the one hand to India, the Far East, and Australia, and on the other to Zanzibar and the Cape. In 1839 the population of Aden was less than 1,000, but by 1911 it had grown to 36,617. The census for that year showed an increase of 2,191, but for the 20 years preceding, it was stationary. The gross revenue for the year 1911-12 was Rs. 40,00,000 There are three printing presses, of which one is in the gaol, and the other two belong to a European and a Parsce firm of merchants. The port is visited yearly by some 1,600 steamers with a tota.! tonnage of 4 millions. The principal articles of import are coffee^ cotton piece-goods, grain, hides, coal, opiun, cotton-twist, and yarn. The exports are in the main a repetition of the imports. Of the total imports, nearly one-thiid comes from the east coast of Africa, and another third from Arabia. Of the total exports nearly one-third again goes to the east coast of Africa. In 1911 there were 2,730 shops in Aden. The principal buildings are as follows; Barracks 94 ; houses, 158 ; public buildings, 14 including 2 hotels.24 ADEN ADEN (PROTECTORATE)— A territory in south-western Arabia which beJongs geographically to Yemen, but politi cally to Bombay. So far, the land frontier of the Aden Protectorate has only been de marcated on the west and north-west sides. As will be seen from the map which ac companies this Gazetteer, the boundary line runs irregularly from Hisn Murad on the coast to a point on the Wadi Bana about 11 miles east-north-east from the Turkish post of Qa'tabah. From there onwards it follows a bearing of true north-east from Lakmat-ash- Shub {see map) towards the Ruba'-al-Khali. The area of the Protectorate cannot be estimated nor can it be until the eastern frontier has been demarcated. With the exception of the comparatively small stretches of maritime plain in the south, practically the whole of this district is mountainous, its chains being offshoots of the Yemen highlands. In the west and south-west, the mountains are rugged and bare, the principal peaks being Hawab, 4,183 feet, Tafasu, 3,619 feet. Sin Sanfa, 2,834 feet, Kharaz, 2,766 feet, Al-Jariba, 2,608 feet Umm Misas, 2,055 feet, and Wusid, or Barn Hill, 1,979 feet. To the north-west, along the frontier, are ranges of which the general altitude is from 4,000 to 6,000 feet, the principl peaks being Jabal Jihaf, Jabal Harlr, jabal Domenat, and Jabal Hasha. The highest mountains in the Protectorate are Jabal Jihaf and Jabal Harir each 7,800 feet; and Jabal Shamroh, near the east bank of the Wadi Bana where it crosses the frontier. The principal watercourses are the Tiban, the Bana, and the Hasan. Of the first named the most important tributaries are the Warazan and the Juban. Harbours and Anchorages. —In the whole coastline of the British Protectorate, the harbour of Aden itself is the only one giving shelter to vessels in all weathers. Along the coast to the eastward, however, there are various bays which under certain conditions of wind and weather afford safe anchorage. Of these the more important are Shuqrah, Maqatln, Ghubbat 'Ain, Majdahah, Bandar Burum, Mukalla, and Bandar Lask, at Qishn. The names and fighting strengths of the various tribes in the Protectorate are as follows: — Amiri (under the Amir of Dala) ,. ,, ,. •. 10,000 Haushabi .. .. .. .. •• •• 2,500 Subaihi .. .. .. .. .. • • 3,000 Abdali (indifferent fighters) .. .. .. .. 2,000 Yafai (Upper) .. .. .. .. .. .. 20,000 Yafai (Lower) .. .. .. .. .. .. 8,000 Fadhli .. .. .. .. .. •. •. 6,000 Aulaki, Upper (including 1,000 regulars) .. ,, .. 9,000 Aulaki, Lower .. .. .. .. . .. 4,000 Alawi &gt; 7*0 A11 .&gt; * • •• •• •• •• •• • Akrabi j Wahidi .. .. .. •. .. .. 2,500 Total .. 67,750 Irrigation and Agriculture —Although agriculture claims the attention of a large pro portion of the inhabitants of the Protectorate, cultivation is restricted, owing to the difficulties of irrigation, to the mountain valleys and slopes, and to such alluvial tracts as lie near the watercourses. In the highlands irrigation is carried out from wells, and in the low-lying districts, from the watercourses. The staple food of the country is millet, of which two kinds, dhurra and dukhn, are grown. The remaining products are maize, wheat, barley, cattle-fodder, dates, onions, grapes, small peaches, indigo; coffee, and cotton. With perhaps the exception of Lahaj, none of the districts of the Protectorate produce more cereal food-stuffs than are required for local consumption, taking good years with tad. Commerce and industries. —The greater portion of the trade in the districts under British Protection, more especially m the western portion, is a transit trade from Turkish Yemen, from which coffee, qdt, and skins, are exported, and to which in return kerosine oil, piece-goods, tobacco, etc., are imported. The districts through which these commo dities pass obtain a considerable revenue from transit dues, in return for which theyADEN 25 guarantee the safety of the caravans. Hides are the principal export from Dala', and sharks' fins from the coast towns. Honey is largely exported from Yashbnm, and frankincense, gum, and attar of roses from the Hadhramaut. Breech-loading rifles are freely imported, large numbers coming via Ras-al-'Ara. The Jews are the chief artificers, and produce silver-work, dagger sheaths, etc. Some rough blacksmith's work, weaving (by Jews only), dyeing, matting, and carpentering, are also done. Gunpowder is manufactured by the Jews and Arabs who also mould their own bullets to a large extent. Livestock. —Camels are the universal beast of burde&amp;it hroughout the country. Com pared with those of central Arabia, they are of an inferior stamp, and can only carry loads of from 300 to 400 lbs. They are not very plentiful, and itwou'd be difficult to collect at short notice more than 1,500 camels at any centre in the Protectorate. Horses are very scarce, but donkeys, of a small, strong breed, are fairly numerous. Cattle, including plough and slaughter oxen, and milch-cows, are plentiful, and sheep and goats are very numerous. Chickens are obtainable practically everywhere, but are sold only by the Jews. Coinage. —In the port of Aden the medium of circulation is the rupee. Throughout the Protectorate, however, the coin most in use is the Austrian Maria Theresa dollar, or real, the value of which in Dala is from one rupee four annas to one rupee eight annas. The standard coinage of India is also current. Amongst the Arabs the four-anna piece known as Baola, being a corruption of the word paola. Trade and Navigation Report for 1915-16. The report on the Trade and Navigation of the port of Aden for the year ending 31st March 1916, states : — 2. The total trade of the Port of Aden for the year under review shows an increase of £420,590. Merchandise inrcreased by £710,587 but Treasure decreased by £289,997. 3. Foreign trade increased from £5,162,470 to £5,626,658. Indian trade from £1,519,155 to £1,575,256 but land trade decreased from £257,984 to £158,285. Foreign trade increased in merchandise by £684,740 but decreased in treasure by £220,552. Indian trade increased in merchandsie by £123,813 but decreased in treasure by £67,712. Land trade decreased in merchandise by £97,966 and in treasure by £1,733. 4. Government Stores and Government tressure amounted to (approximate 1 y) £135162 as against £123 981 the year previous, showing an increase of £11,181. These figures cannot be considered as even approximately correct, and are far below the actuals, as the value for Government stores cannot be obtained, though the number of packages are furnished but without the necessary details. 5. The trade of Aden is divided into three main divisions—Foreign, Indian and land. 6. The principal increases in the general trade were in cotton piece-goods, grey especially ; cotton twist and yarns ; skins, raw ; coffee ; tea ; gums and resins, spices ; oil, kerosine, which increased in both quantity and value ; sugar which increased in value but decreased in quantity ; and similarly with coal. The important items which show decreases are—hides, raw ; garain and pulse ; to bacco, unmanufactured ; metals ; shells ; wax ; seeds ; salt; wood and artilces per post. The grand total of the sea-borne trade of imports and exports combined amounted to £7,201,914 as compared with £6,681,625 the year previous, showing an increase of £520,289 or 7*79 per cent. Imports of foreign merchandise amounted to £2,380,503 as against £2,084,158 the year before, showing in increase of £296,345 or 14*21 per cent. Imports of Indian merchandise increased from £1,043,494 to £1,115,536 or by £76,042 or 7*27 per cent. Exports of foreign mechandise amounted to £2,839,301 as against £2,450,906, showing an increase of £388,395 or 15*84 per cent. Exports of Indian merchandise increased from £157,059 to £204,830 or by £47,771 or 30.41 per cent. Imports of foreign treasure decreased in gold by £45,629 and in silver by £66,800. Imports of Indian treasure c'ecraased in silver by £29,655. Exports of foreign treasure increased in gold by £3,215 but decreased in silver by £111,338. Exports of Indian treasure decreased in gold by £48,770 but increased in silver by £10.713, C52(w)GSB ^ e26 ADEN The total sea-borne trade amounted to £6,544,170, excluding treasure. The relative positions of the countries compared with the year previous are the same, the only signifi cant facts being the large increases noticed in the trade of the United States of America and Asia (Red Sea Ports, etc.), and the great diminution of trade with Continental Europe. The British Empire leads with a total of £2,272 • 6.2, of which India's share is £1,324*39, or about half. Africa follows with a total of £1,506 *43 a nd Asia next with a total of £,1,039*33; the United States of America follows very closely with a total of £,1,033*61 and Europe exhibits the small total of £392*18. British Empire increased in the total trade by £205 • 92 (in thousand), chiefty in imports from and exports to British Somalilands and especially in exports to Suakin and Port Soudan. Imports from the United Kingdom shows little difference, but experts thereto show a large falling off. Trade with India increased in imports and exports. Continental Europe decreased in the total trade by £93*30, especially in imports from Austria. Exports to Italy show a large increase due to Hides, raw, mainly. Africa increased by £78*36 due to the export trade; imports decreased. Exports increased largely to Italian East-Africa and Djibouti in grey piece-goods, chiefly. The decrease in imports is largest from the same ports, chiefly in hides and skins, raw, which were shipped direct in larger consignments than usual. Asia—The total value inreased from £852 * 12 to £1,039 * 33, or by £187 *21, due mainly to the trade with the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf ports in imports and exports. Asiatic Turkey shows a large increase in imports due to dates, which decreased from Persia this year. America exhibits a very large increase in both imports and exports. The imports of grey piece- goods increased enormously, and in exports, coffee and skins, raw, show large in creases. t The number of steamers that called at Aden, including Government vessels, was 1,373 against 1,624 the year before. The number of Government vessels alone was 472 against 420 and the year previous. TRIBES OF THE ADEN PROTECTORATE, General Summary. The territory, in the interior, forming the British Protectorate, is in the possession of nine principal tribes, recognised by the Porte as under British influence. It also includes their sub-tribes or dependencies. The nine tribes are—• The 'Abdali. The 'Akrabi. The Eadhli. The Haushabi. The 'Aulakl. The Yafa'i. The SubaihI. The Amlri (Dhala). The 'Alawi. In addition, relations exist with the following tribes along the coast of fh. ^ * The Wahidi. 16 east: The Shaikh of 'Irka. The Shaikh of Lower Haura. The Ka'aiti (of Mukalla and Shehr). The town of Qishn and the island of Soqotra (Mahri).32 ADEN 'ABDALl— The district inhabited by the 'Abdali tribe, which has been known from very early times as Lahej, is bounded on the west by a line starting from a boundary pillar situated about a mile from the sea near the Hiswa, on the northern shore of the Aden harbour. Passing about three miles to the east of Bir Ahmad and west of Darab through an un cultivated space, the line runs to A1 Anad, a small stone fort about thirty-five miles from Aden Barrier Gate. From A1 Anad it crosses sand drifts and desert to near Bir Uwaidain ; thence it turns south-west towards Imad where it meets British territory. Lahej may be generally described as a large sandy plain watered by a torrent which bifurcates a few miles below Zaida. The western branch, Wadi-ul-Kablr, finds its way to the sea at Hiswa ; the eastern branch, Wadi-us-Saghir, after passing 'Imad. It is only after floods that the water ever reaches Darb and Fiyush, but it may always be found in the river bed a few feet below the surface. The stream is perennial and rises beyond the HaushabI territory in the neighbourhood of Ta'izz. The population, which is roughly estimated at 15,000, consists of ' Abdali Muwallads,* a cross between Arabs and Africans who are only a degree below pure Arabs in social status, a sprinkling of Somalis, Khadim, a migratory people of negro descent employed as scavengers and Hajiris,* another despised class who visit the maritime plain in harvest time. The' Abdali have never had a warlike reputation. They are largely engaged in cultivat ing the fertile tract enclosed by the two branches of the Tiban, and our relations with them have always been close and friendly. Al-Hauta, the capital, has an estimated poulation of 9,000. It is the only town in the district, the rest being mere villages. Among these are Zaida, just south of which the Tiban divides into two branches, and Shakka a mile farther north. Both are on the left bank amid well cultivated lands. They are built of mud bricks and walled. The sub-divisions of the 'Abdali are as foJlows :— Ahl Mujawwar. Ahl Yamani. Ahl Dhafar. Lashun. Ladrub. Sakin-hal-'Ali. Ahl-us-Simsam. Ahl-un-Naum.

The Sultan of Lahej entertains a number of Swahili slaves, who form his body guard. The population is estimated at about 15,000 but this gives no clue to the fighting etrength of the tribe as they prefer hiring mercenaries to fighting themselves. In 1909 there were 30 Shaikhs of some importance in the tribe, with a total following of about 1,800 men. These Shaikhs were liable to be called on for military service. The administration of civil and criminal justice is in the hands of the Qadhi of Lahej. The Sultan occasionally adjudicates in serious cases. Murder, man-slaughter, etc., may be punished by death at the hands of the nearest relative of the deceased, but blood money, ' diya ' is usually accepted instead. In the case of wilful murder the price is about one hundred female camels. Revenue. —The revenues of the Lahej state are derived from several sources ; land tax, transit dues, river tax and from a large number of monopolies, besides a stipend from the British Government. The land tax amounts to H dollars per 11 dhimd' (about J of an acre) per annum. In addition to this, tithes are levied on produce. The total revenue derived from these sources may be estimated at 1,500 dollars per annum. In 1885 it was estimated that the Sultan derived a yearly average of 30,000 dollars from transit dues. From the river water, 3,000 dollars annually were obtained : monopolies fetched 8,000 dollars ; his own landed property yielded 10,000 dollars ; and the stipend from Government aggregated to nearly 20,000 making an annual total revenue of nearly 72,000 dollars at that time. It is probably considerably more at the present time (1914). 1 AKRABI— The territory occupied by the 'Akrabi is of small area. The coast line extends from the Khor or creek of Bir Ahmad to Ras ' Imran, while inland the possessions of the tribe reach to an undetermined point between the villages of Bir Ahmad and Waht situated in the Khabt, or desert tract, which forms a debateable land between the territories of the 'Abdali and 'Akrabi chiefs. The exact boundaries of the two districts have never been accurately settled and the Khabt is looked upon as common property. They were originally a sub-tribe of the l Abdali till, over 100 years back, they asserted their independence, and wrested the fort of Bir Ahmad from the Sultan of Lahej. Unlike most Muhammadans the 'Akrabi are not all total abstainers. Their usual alcholic drink is toddy. It is impossible to give an estimate of their population, but they are a small tribe capable cf furnishing some 250 fighting men. There are about 250 fighting men in the 'Akrabi tribe, most of them reside at Bir Ahmad. Though small in point of numbers the 'Akrabi tribe bears a high reputation for courage. There is one Qadhi for the 'Akrabi district, who, however, only exercises jurisdiction in matrimonial matters. All criminal and civil cases are disposed of by the 'Akrabi chief according to custom. Revenue. —The chief source of revenue is the jowari and karbi produced in the districts This yields in ordinary years about 200 dollars. In extraordinary years it may yield 600 dollars. No dues are levied on goods passing out of Aden, and, owing to the gradual diversion of trade, the 'Akrabi chief has latterly derived little or no revenue from transit dues. VALAWl— This tribal area lies to the south of the Amirl country. It is bounded on the south and west by the Haushabi, and on the east by the hills of the Dhanbari, an independent tribe. The whole tract does not, probably, exceed forty square miles in extent. The residence of the chief is Al-Kash'a. The 'Alawi are a small tribe whose principal village is A1 Kash'a, in the Sailat Hardaba, other villages being Al-Khariba, As-Sauda, Al-Hauta, Adh-Dhanib, Jiml and Al-Hajar. The total population does not exceed 1,500. They are a friendly tribe, on bad terms with their neighbours, the Kotaibi. The inhabitants consist of tribesmen, and ' Ra'aya, or subjects, in about equal proportion. C52(w)QSB jf34 ATi EN They have slight peculiarities of dialect by which they may be identified. The population of the villages is as lollows;— Al-Kash'a Al-Khariba As-Sauda 500 100 200 100 50 100 Adh-Dhanib Jiml Al-Hajar .. The fighting strength of the tribe has been estimated at 500, but this appears to be excessive. They employ mercenaries from the Dhanbaris and other Radfan tribes to assist them in their wars. The family of the ruling Shaikh came originally from Lower Yafa'. At one time they were Governors of the district under the Imam of San'a, but were subordinate to the Governor of the Haushabl country. When the power of the Imam declined they became independent. Criminal and civil matters are disposed of by the ShaikV, but an appeal lies to the Qadhi of Adh-Dhubayyat, a Saiyid village on the highest peak on the mountain range that forms the northern border of the'Alawl country. His decision is final. Blood money is accepted for murder, but the heirs may slay the murderer if it is not paid. The Qadhi at Al-Khariba performs all marriage ceremonies. Revenue. —The revenue is estimated at 2,500 dollars annually, derived from the crops, transit dues and an annual stipend of sixty dollars from the British Government. Each cultivator is supposed to pay to the Shaikh two Kaibahs (30 lbs.) of grain whenever the crops are good. In the immediate hinterland of Aden the two principal rivers of this part of Arabia, the Wadi Tiban, and the Wadi Bana, flow from north to south. The mountain tract between them forms, roughly speaking, the Amir of Dhala's territory. Though the range here presents a very irregular front towards the south, the scarp may be clearly traced in the abrupt cliffs of Jabal Mafari, Adh-Dhubayyat, and Jabal Harir. Southwards, it falls away in a series of broken mountains and hills to the Aden littoral. The above mentioned tract consists mainly of rugged mountains of igneous rock, with here and there broad cultivated valleys. The Amir of Dhala's territory is bounded on the north by a line which leaves the Wadi Bana at the foot of a prominent hill, Haidh Ithri, runs west over the crest of this hill and down to the valley of the Sailat Bakain, across it, and up Haidh Sala a big spur of Jabal Harir, divides the village of Adina on the south from Marat on the north, and reaches the summit of Jabal Harir just north of the village of Al-Fokaha, descends by the Naqil Haban spur, passes just north of the Shairi village of Khubaidat and then runs down the southern branch of the WadT-ul-Haslab to near the village of Sarara, then turns north, over the peak of Jabal Akram, and crosses the valley north of that hill between the Amiri village of Dar-ul-Hanbali and the Muflahi village of Khalla, then north-west among the foothills of the Shaibi range near the Amiri village of Al-Kurain to a conspicu ous red rock which marks the junction of the lands of Habil-ul-Jilb (Shaibi), Al-Kurain and Al-Ukla. The line then goes north up a steep spur to a point on the Marais border known as Has Naqil Adana. From this point westwards the Amir's border is the frontier between the British protectorate and Turkish territory. The line goes west across the Naqil Suqda to Nijd Ma'wad at the head of the Wadi Keshan, then south to the summit of the hill called Jabal Barkan ; west along the southern slopes of a ridge to its western point, known as Jabal Jerad, thence to Nijd Aslum J a mile south of Ka'taba ; crosses the Sailat Ka'taba two miles below the town, then south-west to Nijd-un-Nus, turns due west across Habil Bajah and the Sailat Human to the tomb of Wali 'Umr Isma'il, thence goes south-west, crossing the Wadi Jimri just above Kule'a-us-Sufla, to high ground called HabilHawar; thence it runs south across the Wadi Tiban and up to a high north- eastern shoulder of Jabal Hesha known as Jabal Sarir. 'AMIRl—I fe ADEN 35 The districts which border on the Amir of Dhala's territory along the above line are as i follows From the Wadi Bana to the Sailat Bakain, the Shaibi districts of the Ab- I Musallami and the As-Siel; thence across Jabal Harlr and across Jabal-Akram to the I Shaibi of foot hills is a district belonging to the Muflahi section of the Yafa'i, the central I village of which is Khalla.

The Amir of Dhala's territory is bounded on the north by a line which, from Haidh . . .. Hasun, runs east for a short distance along the main range, then follows to the spur forming the southern watershed of Wadi Hilhal, crosses the Wadi Tiban at the junction to its left bank tributary, the Wadi Shan, ascends and follows southwards the crest of the mountains above the left bank of the Tiban so as to exclude the Haushabi villages and lands of Al-Kama and Lijma, and meets the Wadi Tiban again at the junction of the Wadi and Jabal Makhran ; leaves the Wadi Tiban again, following eastwards the crest of the hills forming ^ en the southern watershed of the Wadi Makhran to the Kalaban peak, thence along the col, which is crossed by the pass (Naqil Hesha at the head of the Wadi Bilih, then south- 'ock, with east along the southern watershed of the Sailat Kharjan and down a spur to a point called Safa Atla on the right bank of the Wadi-ul-Milah ; thence north across the Wadi Wadi ul-Milah up to the peak of Jabal Barrash and follows the crest line 3J miles further 8 hM an ^ north, then follows round the head of a tributary of the Sailat-umm-Suhaibiya and runs of south-east down to the ridge above the right bank of the Sailat Tuwana, then turns east 1 riches across the Sailat-umm-Suhaibiya just leaving the villages of Al-Hamra and At- be Naqil Tamair to the south.

The north-western part is occupied by the great mountain mass of Jabal Jahaf, with its far-reaching spurs and offshoots. The whole of the south-western part is an intricate mass of rugged mountains conspicuous among which are the peaks of Jabal Mashwara and Jabal-un-Nad in the north, and Jabal Hakla, Habal Hadwa, Haid-ul-Harfa and others, in the south. The south-eastern comer is occupied by the massive and rocky northern spurs of the Radfan range. Rivers. The only rivers are the Wadi Bana and the Wadi Tiban. The Wddi Bandy which rises far to the north-west among the hills north of Ibb, sweeps round the north of the Al-Aud, Marais, and Shaibi countries and enters the territory of th® Amir at its north-eastern comer. Thence it forms its eastern boundary until it passes out of Amiri territory again at the junction of the 'Abdalla and Dairi borders on the east of the Radfan mountains. It runs in a deep valley between big hills, but there are broad cultivated spaces on its banks in parts. The river runs from 2 to 3 feet deep in the dry season. The Wddl Tiban which rises between Ibb and Jibla enters 'Amiri territory in the low-lying Dakkam country north-west of Jabal Jahaf. It then turns south and flows near the western border down a narrow gorge between Jabal Jahaf and Jabal Hesha. Through the Ahmadi country its valley its comparatively open, as much as a quarter of a mile wide in places with stretches of cultivation at intervals along its banks. The Wadi Tiban runs about a foot deep, and 10 to 15 yards wide in the dry season. It leaves 'Amiri territory at the Haushabi border, about 25 miles south of the point where it entered it. Both the Wadi Bana and the Wadi Tiban are frequently enclosed by narrow gorges and both are liable to sudden floods. AU other wddls in Amiri territory are torrent beds, which are either dry, except in tim# of sudden flood, or have or&gt;ly a few small springs. DhdJa. (Lat. 13° 42' north; Long. 44° 43'east; Elevation, 4,900 feet.) The town of Dhala with the residence of the Amir stands at the head of an open high- tl? ™u 1Ch fal m. aWay ^ntly to the north, draining to the Sailat Ka'taba, and so to the Wad . Tiban. This valley extends about 10 miles from north to south and is on an average 3 miles in width. Its central part is caUed Wadi-us-Safiya. The chief tributa- nes to the Wadi-us-Safiya are the Wadi Insham and Wadi Ghosha draining the lands between Dhala and Kabar; the Wadi Anama and Wadi Laf draining the Ash-Shairaf distnct: the Wadi Rahban and Wadi Sirr from Dhala past Jalila: the Wadi Dahira and ara ® in f ir th J e northernmost part of the Shairi country and the Muflahi K^v ,. 0fK ^- : xr T l Suhal draillin g ^ lands of Al-Husain, Marfad, and Khobar: the Wadi Haza closely skirting the north-eastern foot of Jabal Jahaf. The greater part of these are mere depressions without any marked watercourse. In contrast to the rugged mountains, which enclose it on all sides, this country has the appearance of a P lai n, but the surface is broken by numerous rocky eminences, and broad ' as the stony undulations are called; these are clothed with a scattered growth of thorn, cactus, aloe, etc. 6 T he numerous villages are solidly built of stone, and most are perched on rocky 0miu6ixces, * .

The crest line then rises to the flat-topped ridge of Jabal Harir which bounds the view to the east. Enclosed in this amphitheatre of mountains lies the Dhala plateau. Its eastern part is broken :by the rocky ridges of the Shairi country which rise to a high peak at their southern end, while north of them Jabal Akram of the Muflahi (Yafa) stands conspicuous. , , .. , ,, Immediately north-east of Dhala town is a mass of rocky hills, which hide from view the open plain at the head of the Khuraiba pass. Just beyond these hills to the north stands the commanding isolated hill Jabal Shahad, which overlooks all routes across the plateau from Dhala, and from the Khuraiba pass, and which was fortified and occupied by the Turks throughout 1902. x i. i tm .- t &gt; m . xt. In the plain that lies stretched below, as one looks north from Jabal Dhi 15ait, tne village of Al-Kabar, on a conical hiJl, is a central object a mile distant. Half a mile further north is the shrine of W all Shafi, which stands at the eastern foot of the Kharba ridge : this is a narrow sharp crested ridge which rises 150 to 200 feet above the plain, and lies across it east and west about J-mile in length. Near its western end, not far from the foot of Jabal Jahaf, is another abrupt rocky hill on which stands the village of Looking past the eastern side of Al-Kabar, and about a mile beyond it Al-Jalila is ieen, on a low ridge which runs north-west from Jabal Shahad. A mile and a half north of A1 Jalila another isolated hill, Jabal-us-Sauda, similar in appearance to Jabal Shahad, rises from the middle of the plain. , , , . Ka'taba is visible on a clear day, the direction being over Wadi Shafi and the low hills near Sirafi. Over the western shoulder of Jabal-us-Sauda three towers on a ridge mark the position of Lakmat-ush-Sh'ub, and still further Al-Ukla may be discerned at the foot of the Marais hills. 11 _ _ Over the eastern shoulder of Jabal Shahad, Al-Husain, where a weekly Tuesday market is held, may be seen on a spur which runs west from Jabal Akram. DJ iq J cl toiow. —The residence of the Amir is called Dar-ul-Haidh. It consists of a small group of ' ddrSy' or stone towers, and stands on the top of a rocky hill. The town clusters at the northern foot of this hill, and partly up its slopes about 200 feet below. It is compactly built and consists of about 325 houses, most of which are solidly constructed square stone dcirs, three or four storeys in height; about a quarter are the less pretentious houses of Jews. The streets are narrow, but irregular and dirty. On the western side of the town is an open space where the weekly market is held, and the Jews prepare thread for weaving, and beside it the Jews' quarter and synagogue. On the eastern side is a smaller open space where skins are dried and cured, and beyond it another small Jewish quarter. On the northern side of the town is the principal mosque, with a white topped minaret. There is also a mosque at a little distance to the north, with a graveyard beside it and a shrine Wali Muthanna 'Abdul Hamid ; also several outlying ' dors ' on slight eminences. Half a mile to the west, on a hill, is a shrine Wali Abu Dar. The ground right up to the town is terraced for cultivation. On the southern side of the hill is the village of Habil Dhi Ishar, a suburb of Dhala. ARKAMI— At the head of the Ka'luli Wadi, is a small valley at the south foot of J. Hawab inhabit ed by a small clan of about 20 men. There is a tower with a little cultivation near, and a well in a ravine about a mile to the south, only some 18 inches in diameter, and con taining, when sieen, about 100 feet of water. It was said by the inhabitants to yield a good supply. The road from the Wadi Bit an to the Haiki valley passes through thia valley—Wadi Sadair—the passes leading in and out, though not high, have several very difficult bits for camels. Both the Ka'luli and the 'Arkami inhabit Buraimi territory. They are independent; at the present time, of the Buraimi Shaikh.IS 1BKN ATIFI—• The Atifi proper do not appear to number more than about 60 men, although their tribal limits extend south of the Buraimi from near Umm Fajra to Hawairib and the little group of Turan villages, their only fixed habitation, and along the coast from the Bar- haimi border to Kuddam, north of Dubab. With the exception of a well about a mile east of Nubat Sayyaila (Sayyaila well is dry) and a little cultivation near it, the whole of the southern portion is desert. Turan itself contains three fair wells and a stream, Ghail Hazaruf, not far up the Wadi Turan, and there is some cultivation near the villages. The Busaili, a small clan of Saiyids, live with the Atifi, at Turan. There are several clans living in Atifi territory to the north and along the coast. Of these the Mahuwali or Huraibi are nomads who inhabit the neighbourhood of the Wadi Hurrim and the Sanfa range to the north-west. There is no cultivatipn in the Wadi Hurrim except at Umm Nabia but water is plentiful at intervals in spring pools the most abundant being at Ghail Kulaita, where the track from Ras-ul-Ara to Karaba in the Haiki country, strikes the Hurrim. 300 men and 400 camels were watered there in May before the rains, and produced no apparent diminution of the supply The Wadi Hurrim is enclosed by steep rocky banks for most of its course and below Ghail Kulaita is very difficult for transport. The Makhaya and the Bani Fatah inhabit the lower part of the Wadi Hurrim where it issues from the hills, near the hamlet of Umm Nabia, which consists of one stone tower and a few karbi huts with a few acres of cultivation. There is a good well and springs in the Wadi Hurrim about 2 miles above the hamlet. The Bani Fatah who are Sufis, also own the wells of 'Uzzaf and Sukaya on the coast. They own a few riding camels and flocks of sheep and goats, with which they wander in search of pasture. The Jarthati live near J. Wusid and J. Kharaz. About 2 miles north of J Wusid is a narrow gorge, Ghail Barbar, containing a perennial rivulet, which fills a masonry tank in good repair, of a capacity of about 5,000 gallons, once in 12 hours There is a tower and a little cultivation, irrigated by this tank, a little below it. A fair well— Hisi Fara—exists about 2J miles off, just to the south of J. Wusid. The Boundary Commission and supporting column, some 800 men and 500 animals in all, were camped for two days at Ghail Barbar, and good water was procured in sufficient quantity with reasonable economy from the spring and well. A wing of a Native Infantry regiment camped there for several weeks and obtained miles^south^of ^ ^ cultivation ^ at Ad-Didia a few Throughout the Atifi country, the men, in the proportion of about 2 out of 3 were armed w'th breech-loaders, the remainder carrying spears or swords. They anneared perfectly peaceful and well disposed, and under normal circumstanced, a smdl esSrt ol ten to twenty sowars would probably be sufficient. The tribes enumerated above include practically all the Subaihi clans of any importance with the exception of the Barhemi, who inhabit the sea-coast, east of Jabal Kharaz and who are from all accounts a fairly well behaved section, nomads for the most part and the Rijai of Am Rija numbering about 70 men.

A large extent of the' Aulaki country is under cultivation and there are numerous flocks of sheep and goats and herds of camels in the extensive pastures. The 'Aulaki possess a fine breed of horses and are the only tribe in these parts that possess any. Millet, wheat, and jowwi are grown in the low lands ; tahaf and kinib (qinnab) (hemp), inferior grains, in the hilly districts. Salt mines are found in the neighbourhood of Nasab, the capital of the Upper' Aulaki'a territory. The sidr tree abounds in this region. It grows to a height of from 20 to 50 feet and is used for fuel and for making huts, while its fruit, called nabak, is eaten by men and cattle. The 'Aulaki is a warlike, but not predatory tribe. According to Mr. Bury the Upper 'Aulaki can muster some 9,000 fighting men, of whom about 1,000 are ' 'asfcan,' or professional soldiers, maintained by the Sultan. The two main divisions of the Upper 'Aulaki, called the Ahl Ma'n and the Ahl Mahajar, are said to be able to furnish some 4,000 fighting men each. No estimate can be formed of the fighting strength of the Lower 'Aulaki. Of its sub- tribes the Yarli are the most numerous, form the army, and are the chief strength of the tribe. The Upper 'Aulaki Shaikh and the Lower 'Aulaki Sultan were formerly Wakils or Viceroys of the Imam's, but established their independence on the breakup of the power of the Imams of San'a about a century ago. All matters, criminal and civil, are disposed of by the Sultans or Shaikhs, acting on the advice of Shaikhs, Saiyids, or Sharifs in conformity with custom. There is one Qddhi at Nusab and one at Ahwar, but they only perform marriage ceremonies. Revenue. —It is impossible to give any accurate estimate of the revenue, but the Upper 'Aulaki Sultan's has been estimated at Rs. 16,000, the Upper 'Aulaki Shaikh's at Rs. 6,000 and the Lower 'Aulaki's at Rs. 10,000. Upper 'Aulaki. —No estimate of the total population can be given. The principal towns and villages in the Upper 'Aulaki Sultan's territory are as follows :— Estimated population.

The Lakmush, though among the Aivalik, are not of them. They claim to be of Himyaritic origin and to have kinship with their neighbours the Dhujaibi. The Ba Kazim have many sub-tribes, among whom are the following:— Sham'i. Yahwi. Yarli'. Ahl Badi. Ahl Nashra. Ahl-Salim. Mansuri. Maribi. Ahl-ul-Haik. Hatali. Baz'ali. Ahl-ba-Yarad. Of these the Sham'i takes the lead on account of their supposed superior intelligencei and sagacity. baid A— The Baida territory is bounded on the north by Baihan-ul-Kasab, on the west by the the Upper Yala'i country, on the south by Al-Marakisha, and on the east by the 'Aulaki. It is an elevated plateau sloping gradually to the low-lying country of Baihan-ud-Daula to the north, and the 'Aulaki country east and south. The soil is of a sandy nature and fertile. The district of Baida and its dependencies form a collection of small tribes in the nature of a confederacy under the ' Amm Rasas Sultanate of Baida. The Baida Sultans were formerly a very powerful factor, excercising a wide-spread and effective influence, involving the payment of tribute, and the performance of military service by the tribes subject to the central authority. Their influence has waned considerably of late years. Some of the tribes have fallen under Turkish influence and some, more particularly those to the north-west, have become independent. Districts under BatdI. Baidd or Balad-ud-Dakar {the plateau country). Baida proper is inhabited by some ten tribes :— The Azzani. The Al-'Umar. HomaikanL Hashamt Dubani. Dafari. Madafari. ' Hayashi. Mash'ari. Maljami (more properly classed as a dependency). The fighting strength generally attributed to the first nine is 3,000 men, but this is probably much exaggerated. Taffa is a generic name comprising the Ayashi, Hashami and Dafari tribes. The soil is of a sandy nature and is fertile, indigo being grown as well as jowari and hajri. The inhabitants of Baida city are largely engaged in dyeing cloths. Other small tribes which appear to be directly dependent on Baida are — T h * Bani YWhose country is also called the Wad Markha.

The country is level and sandy. Wells are said to be numerous, and dates, cotton and indigo are grown. Rock salt is also extracted from two hills, and exported in large quantities to districts to the south and south-west. There are many camels and horses in the country. The population is said to be 1,500 men, of whom one-third being weavers and dyers, are not classed as fighting men.

' Ra'aya' or subjects of theirs, although practically independent at the present time, who inhabit country as far west as J. 'Akkar about 25 miles east of Mokha, but the northernmost clans have fallen under the influenca of the Mokha authorities. The Buraimi proper live at Dar Mujaba and a few near Umm Fajra, the Khulaifi division of the Buraimi living at Umm Fajra itself, a small village with a tower, a few huts and a good well, at which the 1 neighbouring nomads water their flocks. The country to the south consists of rolling sand hills, to the norths the range of hills of J. Musinna and Masna, and to the west between Umm Fajra and the* Wadi Adim, is an undulating, stony plain with many accacia thorn trees. The Bushbushi section live at the hamlet of 'Ali ba Jirjah in the Adim on the Zuraiki border, and the' 'Utri, at Nassara and Bar Salim Thabit, a couple of miles to the south. There is a little cultivation in the neighbourhood, but water is very scarce, the only Well which produces any appreciable supply being. Bir Majdura in Wadi Majdura^ and that is brackish. The Buraimi are an ignorant people, tea great extent nomads, and covering long dis tances on their camels. In common with the other western tribes of the Subaihi, they seems much more peaceably disposed than the eastern tribes such as the Matarafi. DHALI'— The Amir of Dhala's territory is inhabited by a number of different tribes that have little in common besides their Arab nationality^ and few ties to bind them together j beyond the need for mutual support and protection. Many of them barely acknowledge , the Amir's suzerainty. Their frequent fei&amp;is and dissensions keep them apart, and they cannot be regarded in any sense as one people. Society is divided into classes as usual among Arabs, viz., the Saiyids, the priestly caste descended from the Prophet; the Shaikhs, hereditary chiefs ; the Qab&amp;l, or tribesmen ; the Asakir, professional soldiers ; the Ra'aya or peasant farmer class ;• and the slaves. The people are physically a poor race, the men short and slight,, though wiry and active. The majority are not pure Arabs, but show an unmistakeable strain of African slave blood. This is even the case with the Amirs themselves. There are a considerable number of pure negroes among them^ the descendants of former slaves. The people are industrious and simple in their habits ; they have the ordinary Arab characteristics of pride,, and an intense love of independence. They are hospitable self-contained under ordinary circumstances^ but very excitable when provoked They are very jealous and quarrelsome as is proved by the constant strife between tribes and clans, and the blood feuds in almost every family. The manner, in which these feuds are carried on shows them to be vindictive and treacherous, with little sense of honour They are much under the influence of their Saiyids, and have all the fanatical intolerance of a narrow minded Muhammadan community. On the other hand, many of the better class men, not excepting the Saiyids themselves ' when once their prejudices are overcome, prove to be intelligent, courteous and pleasant to deal with. ' ^ A considerable number of the people have travelled and seen the world either as trad ers, or as stokers on board ships, but their experience do not as a rule 'seem to haw lessened their prejudices against the unbeliever. The women though kept in a position of inferiority as Usual with Mu^almans secluded but go about freely and unveiled. They do a great Xk ?he household, such as tending cattle, drawing water, cutting firewood etc . The majority of the population is settled, living in villages of solidty constructed stone houses^ and occupying themselves with agnculture and commerce. A large nronn^nn however, in the southern part especially, are nomadic, keeping large herd! j The men wear a loin cloth, a cloth wranned rrtnnrl f lia rtra .nj. w, &lt;«. drt-bto cET SADEN 45 in the remoter parts of the hills the men bind a mere strip of cloth tightly round their heads, comb their hair out and tie it in a fuzzy bunch at the back of their heads. The custom of tying the ' fatila,' or slow match, round the turban is dying out, as match locks are replaced by rifles. It is usual to go barefooted, but for long distances on the stony hill-paths simple leather sandals are used. Every men carries either a rifle or a matchlock, or a spear and all wear the jambi'a, a broad curved dagger, in the waist cloth ; those of well-to-do people are handsome with chased silver sheaths. Men, who own rifles, wear a waist bandolier with car tridges. The women wear a loose robe with wide sleeves, generally dark blue, but sometimes green or red, embroidered round the collar and down in the front and back, and tied in at the waist by a sash of similar material, the embroidered ends of which hang down in front. They wear a dark head cloth, which falls gracefully over the shoulders. They often cover their faces and bodies with a yellow powder made from the * war as* or bastard saffron, and 'Hurd' {Hindustani Haldi) as a precaution against fever. On occasions they paint their faces with designs in narrow black lines, and some daub their cheeks with a greasy pigment of a vermilion hue. Their chief food consists of bread made from wheat or millet; 6 asid,' a thick porridge made of flour with 4 soman' (ghi, or clarified butter), and boiled goats flesh, or a soup called 4 maraq.' Fowls and eggs are regarded as luxuries. As vegetables they take onions, garlic, carrots, and radishes. They drink coffee at all times, generally a concoction from the husk, called 4 qishr * flavoured with ginger. The men smoke a great deal, using ordinary hookhas, and either Indian tobacco, known as 'surati ' or country tobacco, called 4 Ttanumi ' which comes from Mukalla and elsewhere, and the best quality of which is called 4 arifi. All who can afford it are addicted to chewing 4 icat* There are no regular doctors, but some Saiyids profess a knowledge of alchemy and the use of herbs as medicines, and dispense extracts from the Koran as charms. Barbers bleed and cup and perform circumcision. In the rainy season, when fever is prevalent, a common cactus called 4 kassas ' is chopped up and mixed with food as a purgative. For ulcers, which are very common, effusion from leaves are used, and a brass plate is bound firmly over the sore. For aches and pains it is usual to sear the patient with a hot iron. Sanitary arrangements are wanting. Latrines even in the best houses are merely projections from the wall in the upper story, the filth being allowed to accumulate telow. The religion of the country is that of the ShafT sect of the Sunni Muhairmadans The masjids are kept with care, and the hours of prayer generally observed. Shrines, are very numerous, every section of the population having one to which it is specially devoted. The shrines are either to a revered ancestor, or to some patron saint of ancient tradition. The position of mansab ' in charge of a shrine is an honoured one, and is generally hereditary. The more sacred shrines are centres of pilgrimage. All joyous occasions are celebrated by feasting, slaying bullocks or sheep or goats, and eating 4 ]zaV Any solemn compact between tribes and individuals is sealed by the killing of a goat in the name of the Almighty* The Arabs are punctilious in matters of etiquette. A Shaikh always receives any visitor of distinction with the 4 tashira? or a salute of guns, with ball cartridges as a rule ; and he would consider himself slighted, if the visitor did not accept his hospitality for at least a night. The ordinary mode of greeting between friends is to clasp and kiss tie back of one another's hands. An inferior greeting a Shaikh or Saiyid will bend low ai d kiss him on the knee, and head, and even on the back. There are many local peculiarities of dialect, and the language differs in many re- epects from the Arabic of Egypt»45 ADEN The tribes of the Amir of Dhala's territory may be grouped as follows :— 1. The Amir's own relatives, connections and dependents. 2. The Shairi. ^ 3. The Ahl Jahaf, Bani Said, and the Ahl Mafari. 4. The Azraki and the Mihrabi. 6. The Humaidi and the Ahmadi. 6. The Dakkam. 7. The Halmin. 8. The Al'Ajud tribes. The Amir's own clan are known as the Ahl Ahmad or Ahl-ul-Amir. They together with related clans, the Bani Mas'ad, ' Ay dl Murshid,' Ayal Muthanna, etc., live in Dhala town, and in the Ash-Sharaf district, in Zobaid south of Dhala, and in the districts of Tafwa in the Hardaba valley and Kharafa in the Wadi Dahab. The other branches of the Amir's clan are:— The Bani Hddi of the Ash-Sharaf villages of Dhi Haran, A1 Wa'ra, Kokaba, 01 Sumaid, and Ar-Rabat; and of Kharafa. The Bani Mutahhar of Kharafa and of the northern part of the Dhala plain, viz., the villages of Al-Husain, Marfad Lakmat-ush-Shub, Kubah, Utaria, Sannah, etc. The Bani Shafai of Dhala Zobaid, Haiaz and Kharafa. The Bani Murshid of Khobar and Minadi. The Bani Qdsim of Dhala, Harir, Tafwa and Kharfa. Besides the above there are a great many families who, though not blood connections of the Amir, are immediately subject to and dependent upon him. Such are the Bani Ahadl of Dhala, the Ahl Amama and Barnl Ydkut-ul-Kahaila-ul-Janadha of A1 Khabar, Bdnl Jubarl of Habil Dhi Ishar, the Bani Masha, Bani Habjur and BanVl-Hadldl of Zobaid. The Bani Juwair of Al-Hajar and Al-Kurb, the Ahl Sa'ld Ismail and Ahl Kurman of Marsaba, and the Bani '1-Kumasi of Laghwal. The people of Jabal Harir also come under the heading of immediate dependents of the Amir. They are of the Ra'dya class, and number about 800 souls. They were formerly under Yafa influence and are perhaps of Yafa origin. \ Other communities that are among the immediate dependents of the Amir are : The Ahl Haj Sa'ld of Lakmat-us-Sallah, Sha'b-ul-As'ud, Ad-Dahar, Bajaha and Hadida. They are a Saiyid clan who claim to be descendants of 'Abdul Qadir Jailani; Haj Sa'id was born in Hadhramaut; he became a darwesh, migrated and settle near Jabal Hadid, the spur of Jabal Jahaf above Lakmat-us-Sallah. He is said to have wrought many miracles ; his tomb is preserved with much veneration and his descend ants are revered by the people of Dhala as their special Saiyids. The Ahl Haj Sai'd number about 500 souls. The AUd of Hazzat-ul-Abid, a district comprising four villages at the north-eastern foot of Jabal Jahaf. They are descendants of former slaves and number about 600 souls. The Ahl Basalsl of Al-Minadi, a clan of hereditary caravan guides and camel contrac tors, who originally immigrated form Haushabi country. Some of them are still in Haushabi tetritory, some in Shairi country, and some in Yemen at places on the caravan route to San'a. Those of A1 Minadi number about 50 souls. Altogether the immediate subjects of the Amir probably number about 6,000 souls SHAIRI— The Shairi inhabit the central part of the Dhala plateau, the hills to the east, and tho Khuraiba valley. The estimated population is about 3,000, with about 500 fighting men. There are about 30 villages. They are divided into five clans ;— 1. Said to have been originally settled in the country by the Imam of San'a.52 ADEN The Uzlat Mafcvri is on the western slopes of a conspicuous hill to the west of Dhala, called Jabal Bayada. The Uzlat comprises an extensive basin of terraced cultivation, most of which drains west to the Sailat-ul-Habil, the water-course which divides the Mafari from the Humaidi. The distance from Dhala is 3 miles, and the ascent is made by an easy pass, the Naqil Suaida (see Jahaf), to the village of Suaida. The villages are ;— On Uzlat M afar I. Villages.

The Mafari boundary on the north is here marked by the rocky slopes of Safa Saha above which is the southernmost group of Jahaf villages, Balas, Ukaima, Al-Asdaf, and Bude'a. These belonged formerly to the MafarL AZRAKl— The AzraU (Ahl-Azrak) inhabit the valley south of Dhaia, approached by the Naqil Darjat-un-Nishli pass ; they also inhabit the hills further south down to the Haushabi border. There are two divisions :— The Saba descended from the Yafa, Bam Saba. The Murhaibi descended from the Zaidi of Hashid wa Bakil, northern Yemen. They are bounded on the north and west by Dhala ; Mafari ; Ahmad! ; Mihrabi; and Haushabi. On the south by Haushabi and 'Alawi. On the east by 'Alawi, and the Amir of Dhala's district? of Adh-Dhubayyat, Az-Zanad, and Zobaid. The most northerly outlying village is Thalath on the hills 1 £ miles due west of Dhala town. The gorge of Al-Madhiq in the Wadi Tabaghain marks the meeting point of the ter ritories of the Azraki, Mafari, Ahmadi, and Mihrabi. The hill of Safa Atla on the right bank of the Wadi-ul-Milah marks the meeting point of the territories of the Azraki, Haushabi and 'Alawi. Estimated population. —1,800, with about 350 to 400 men capable of bearing arms. The Shaikhs have full criminal jurisdiction over the tribe. They pay no tribute to the Amir, but are requiied to give military service in time of war. The settled population is chiefly centred in villages in the valleys of the Sailat-ul- Azrak, which is the upper course of the Wadi Tabaghain. There are fair perennial springs near the northernmost villages, but the rainfall is precarious, and the crops are to some extent dependent on freshets from the surrounding hills in the rainy season. To the south across the hills (Jabal Mashwara, etc.), which bound the above valley, are several deep valleys, the nomad inhabitants of which constitute rather more than half the population of the Azraki. The district is called Balad-us-Saraya Ruhba. The chief valleys are those of the Sailat Tuwana and the Selat Mashwara (upper course of the Wadi-ul-Milah). To the south-west the Wadi Makhran, draining to the Tiban, has a small Azraki population (40 men). There are isolated patches of cultivation in all these valleys, but for the most part they are narrowly enclosed between steep rocky hills, and water is nowhere plentiful. The people are pastoral.

The various Saiyid communities settled in the Amir of Dhala's territories constitute a large and important element in the population. Though generally looked up to as the priestly caste there is little in their outward appearance to distinguish them from ordinary Arabs. Only a few of the principal ones, who specially devote themselves to religious exercises, wear white clothes and carry rosaries. The majority dress similarly to the Arab tribesmen, carry arms as they do, and occupy themselves with agriculture and trading. They are as much engaged in feuds and quarrels, and as ready to resort to fighting. The Saiyid communities are generally wealthy and powerful, and in most cases are practically independent. Saiyids are permitted to marry women of other classes, but their own women may only marry Saiyids. Adh-Dhubayydt. —The Saiyids of Adh-Dhubayyat are of the branch of Saiyid? known aa ' Sufian ' who are said to have originated from Jibla near Ibb. The tomb of their founder Abu Sufian, is, however, at the village of Sufian near the capital of Lahej. They own a considerable extent of rich land and are very well to do and independent. They are greatly respected by all the people, and the shrine of Wali Hasan, the tomb of one of them who died 20 to 25 years ago, is the chief resort of pilgrims in the Amir of Dhala's territories. The Saiyids together with their adherents (the Bani Mashali, Bani Hashid and Bani'l- Anshali) and their slaves and dependents, number about 500 souls. Ahl Ha] Sa'ld. —The Saiyids of the Ahl Haj Sa'id have been described above among the immediate dependents of the Amir. Saiyids of Arshl. —(See Bani Sa'id above.) Hahil-ul-Jabr. —The Saiyids of Habil-ul-Jabr are a small community only numbering about 50. These Saiyids are associated in many ways with the Yafa across the Wadi Bana. Jews. Jews also constitute a considerable element in the population numbering some thousand^(Crawford says 5,000). Their largest settlements are in Dhala itself (400), at Khurdi on Jabal Jahaf, at Al-Malaha of the Shairi, and at Habil-ul-Jilb at the foot of the Shaibi hills. They are treated by the Arabs with a good deal of contumely and kept under various restrictions, such as not being allowed to own land, not to carry arms, nor to build houses of more than one storey. Nevertheless they seem to be a fairly prosperous and contented community. They live in quarters set apart for them and support themselves as traders, weavers and artificers.ADEfT 65 THe men are distinct from the Arabs in dress and appearance. They wear a white loin cloth, and a longitudinal garment with a hole in the centre by which it is passed over the head, the garment falling to the waist in front and behind, and being tied by strings at the side. On the head is a coloured skull cap and long locks of hair are brought down in front of the ears. They are industrious,-submissive people, and many of them have good features, and not unpleasing appearance r DUBAINI— Beyond the Wadf Heh, the country becomes markedly more fertile in character^— Wadi Umm Farsha, the head-quarters of the Dubaim&gt; containing the first date-palms met with, and good strips of cultivation extending down to the sandy plain near Dar- ul-Kudaiim&gt; with several small villages of two or three towers apiece, and several wells. Umm Farsha itself is supplied by two wells, of which one contains a good quantity of water, but both are brackish. The Dubaini villages also extend westwards along Wadi Ahij, in which there is a well, to the southern part of Wadi Hakat where there is a good deal of cultivation with date palms and is a good well at Birain. Although the Dubaini and the Jurabi are at feud, ex ception seems to be made in the case of Jaraiwi section, whose principal village, Tafih, is in the Wadi Ma'adin among those of the JurabL FADHLI— The territory occupied by the Fadhls tribe extends from the eastern boundary of British limits near 'Imad to the western boundary of the'Aulakl tribe at Maqatin. The northern boundary is conterminous with those of the 'Abdali, Haushabi^ Yafa'i&gt; and 'Aulaki tribes. The country is divided into two large districts,, the low lands of Abyan, and the high lands of the north-east. The low lands of Abyan^ where the alluvium is not covered by drift sand, is very fertile, producing an abundant yield of red and white jowari, and sesamum. Among the hills,, to the' north-west some wheat is raised in addition to jowari, while myrrh trees,, the produce of which is gathered by Somalis, grow in abundance on the limestone heightSr The valley of the Yeramis is estimated to yield 150,0001bs. of jowari^ At Al-Kawr r in the Abyan country north of the Al-Kadam range, are irrigation works Watering 1,000 acres of land. There are said to be 4,000 camels, 10,000 sheep and goats, and 500 cattle in the Fadhli territory. The Fadhli chief has under his nominal suzerainty a large number of tribes, but only a limited number are his full subjects. There are two Qadhis, one at Shuqra and one at Al-Asalay who adjudicate on cases occurring in their respective districts. The murder of one subject by another is punished with death, or by the payment of blood-money (diya) according to the choice of the injured side. The usual amount in payment is 100 she-camels, or 750 dollars. Among the tribesmen, the acceptance of diya is not customary. Revenue. —The Fadhli district is theoretically the property of the Sultan, who exacts about half the produce from the tenants but, as the cultivated area is small and the hill tribes not under complete control, his income from this source is small. Inclusive of the annual stipends from the British Government, the Sultan's annual revenue may be estimated at 10,000 dollars derived from the following sources :— Land revenue, revenue on ' harka ' (a species of potash used for washing purposes and in the preparation of tobacco and snuff), import and export dues, taxes on qdfilas, proceeds of land cultivated by the Sultan on his own account and fees on shop-keepers. Transit dues were abolished by the agreement of 1872. The Fadhli are a proud, warlike and independent race. They are quick to take offence ( and are vindictive and treacherous enemies, but their friendship once secured, they are said to be trustworthy. The fighting men number about 6,800. For detailed statement of the numbers furnished by each sub-tribe, see Chapter III, 4 Population. 1 C52(w)GSB r k66 ADM Government is presenting the Sultan with one 15 -pr. gun and one hundred rounds of ammunition. . . . , , The Fadhli are a proud, warlike, and independent race, and possess in a high degree the virtues and vices of the true Bedouin. They are quick to take offence and are vin- dictive and treacherous enemies, but, their friendship once secured, they are said to be trustworthy. This last statement must, however, be accepted with some reservation, r s like most Arabs in the neighbourhood, they possess few scruples, when their interests are concerned, and are always grasping and avaricious. In the arts of agriculture they are behind the 'AbdalL j ^ The total population is estimated at under 20,000, of whom about 5,000 reside at Shuqra. The FadhH are sub-divided as follows :— Fighting men. 1. Al'ilihi .. 600 13. 2. Hasani 400 14. 3. Maisiri .. 800 15, 4. Hanashi .. 600 16. 5. Yi'dani .. .. 400 17. 6. Markashi ♦. .. 600 18. 7.

(2) Ahl Sanad. (3) Ahl 'Abad. (4) Ahl 'Amm-Busha. (5) Bil'idi. (6) Hautari. (7) Mahman. The Markashi claim descent from the Himyarites, while the Dathmi and Hasani come of Upper 'Aulaki stock. The code of morality among the mountaineers of the Fadhli appears to be of a lower order than that prevailing in the rest of the Yemen. The curious custom exists among; the Markashi of holding a base-born son in greater estimation than a legitimate one. ; j HAIH (A HL)— The small sections inhabiting the Wadi Heh, which contains some cultivation but no well, are counted among the Mansuri. The Khulaifi, especially, bear a reputation for robbery and were originally domiciled near the 'Abdali border, from which the Sultan forced them to move in consequence of their constant depredations. They are still said to push their raids as far afield as the Tiban. These clans were the only Subaihi who manifested any overt hostility to the passage of the commission, causing some delay by disputing the passage of the Am Fidna pass into Wadi Heh. When driven from the heights, they continued firing from Dar Ibra him, which was partly destroyed, by shell-fire, and from the surrounding hills, and they subsequently fired a few shots into camp at night on several occasions. HAUSHABI— The territory inhabited by the Haushabi tribe lies some 30 to 40 miles to the north of Aden and is roughly about 600 square miles in extent. The country consists of a long and narrow strip, its greatest length being from Harur on the east to beyond Kuddash on the west. The whole of the western part is mountainous, the mountains being of a particularly bleak and barren character with little vegetation and rugged sides difficultADEN 67 of ascent. In this portion, cultivation is almost entirely carried on in the valleys of the Tiban, Warezan and various wddw; stretches of ' Habil' or stone-covered plain, occur frequently between the hills, but these are useless for purposes of cultivation. The eastern part is with the exception of some cultivation near Harur and Ar-Raha, sandy desert. . • r n The southern boundary runs from Harur to Nubat Dakim, whence it follows the crest-line of the range of hills running parallel to the right bank of the Tiban to a little, below the junction of the Wadi Akkan, from which it passes in a south-westerly direction, south of Minjara and Hidaba and skirting the north of the Juhaili hills to J. Muharrika. From Harur to Nubat Dakim the border marches with the' Abdali; thence to J. Muharrika with the Subaihi. - „ , - -n £ o- From J, Muharrika it crosses the Wadi Hidaba just below the Kubati village 01 buq- ur-Rabu, then the Wadi Natid at Dar Nasir Harbi, whence it follows in a general north west direction the crest-line of the low hills (J. Ghefan, Humala and Rakabat Tinsam) overlooking the low-lying Yusufiyin and Badu countries. From Tinsam it follows a general north-east direction crossing the Habil 'Arabi just to the south of the village of Nabu, and the Am Amma range at J. Basaisa, on the north side of which Ahmadi territory is met. This portion is the boundary with the Turkish Sanjak of Ta'izz, the conterminous districts being Kubati, Yusufi, Badu and Humar. The boundary is shewn in detail on the map. ttt , ,, Hence the Haushabi boundary with the Ahmadi runs east, north of J. Warwa, to the junction of the Wadi Shan with the Tiban, whence it runs south, on the left bank of the Tiban to the Wadi Makhran, the villages and lands of Lijma and A1 Kam'a, being included on the Haushabi side. The line then runs east along the southern watershed of the Wadi Makhran to J. Kalaban, and along the col crossed by the Naqil Hesha pass at the head of the Wadi Bilih ; then south-east along the southern watershed of the Sailat Kharjan and down a spur to a point called Safa Atla, where the boundary with the Amiri ends. The line then passes south to Al-Milah bordering on the Awall and south-east, by Dar-ul-Ashraf, Bir Shakfa and Bir-al-Jiyin, to Harur, the Dhanban (Radfan tribe nominally under Haushabi influence) being to the north. The villages in the Haushabi country are as a rule small and badly built, consisting of a tower or two each, and a cluster of little stone hovels. The largest villages arte Harur with about 50 houses and Ar-Raha, a cluster of small villages. The Sultan himself lives at Musaimir in a large tower of stone in mud, some 75 feet square and 40 feet high. With the exception of one other tower, the only habitation is a cluster of reed huts where his soldiers and slaves lived. The tower is situated on an eminence some 200 feet above the left bank of the Tiban. The locality is most unhealthy. There are springs of water in the Wadi Jiref, about a mile above its point of junction with the left bank of the Tiban below Musaimir, yielding an abundant supply of good drinking water. The tribe is estimated to number 7,000 souls. j ^ a The country is on the whole a poor one. Fourteen hundred acres are said to be under cultivation, chiefly in the bed of the Tiban, where jowari is grown. On the hills are bushes of babul and rakh : the latter furnishes grazing for camels. Cattle, sheep, and goats are reared, and camels are said to be fairly plentiful. Criminal and civil cases are decided by the Sultan according to custom. Murder is punished by a fine but the deceased's heirs are at liberty to slay the murd.erer if the blood money (770 dollars) is not paid within a certain period. There is only one Qadhi m the whole district. He resides at Ar-Raha and only performs marriage ceremonies. There are nine principal Shaikhs, each having from one to three hundred followers. Corresponding to the sub-divisions of the tribe there are ten districts, one of these is ruled by the Sultan, the others by the chiefs concerned. &gt;n • Revenue. —The annual revenue of the Haushabi Sultan is about 5,500 dollars, prin cipally derived from land tax and transit dues, the latter being levied at the following rates * _ 3 liar For every camel load of jowari • • .. .. # ' i t, ' T ® For every camel load of coffee, ghi, madder, candles honey, war as, cloth and ^ other merchandise from Aden .. •. • • • • ' For every camel load of wheat and other unenumerated produce ' * s™ '»6B ADEN The Sultan receives an annual stipend from the British Government of 648 dollars. The Haushabi are generally peaceably disposed, and though, of late years, they have done a good deal of fighting they cannot be classed under the heading of the warlike tribes of the Yemen. The 'Umur are the most independent spirits among them. This is a division of the tribe consisting of some 6 clans with 200 to 300 fighting men. The personal retainers of the Sultan are represented by about 100 'Asakir. The Dhanbari, nominally under the Haushabi Sultan though actually independent, number several hundreds of fighting men. The total number of lighting men of the Haushabi amounts to about 1,750. The population of the Haushabi country is estimated at about 7,000 souls, mostly nomads, who wander in search of grazing and water for their live stock, whilst a few are engaged in cultivation and camel driving. They form one tribe under their Sultan, sub-divided into some 50 small clans. There are, however, two main divisions, the Haushabi proper, inhabiting the eastern part of the country, and the Tiban valley, as well as the northern boundary, and the 'Amiri (plural 'Umur), a division comprising some 6 clans inhabiting the tract enclosed by the Wadis Warezan and Akkan, and the Wadi Hidaba. They were formerly a small independent tribe who, some generations back, came under the domination of the Haushabi Sultan ; they pay tribute and may be considered an integral portion of the Haushabi. There are no large villages in the Haushabi country and many of the people are nomads. The 'Umur are the most independent .spirits among them, but the Haushabi generally are peaceably disposed, and although, of late years, they have done a good deal of fighting with their neighbours, they would not come under the heading of the war like tribes of Yemen. The classes of society represented in Haushabi territory are the Saiyids, whose prin cipal colony is the shrine of Shabwa in the north-west corner. They are of the Sufian branch, and connected with the Saiyids of Dhubayyat. The tribesmen form the bulk of the population. Those inhabiting the unhealthy Tiban and Warezan valleys are much affected by malaria, and are of inferior physique. The personal retainers of the Sultan are represented by 'Asakir, of whom there are about 100, and the slaves.

It is difficult to imagine how these people live as there is, to all practical purposes, no water in the rocky wastes they inhabit. The Humaidi, and probably others, make use of Bir Humaid on the north side of the Madraja pass, and the Basus are said to use the Tiban at ni^ht There is no known water-supply on the south side of the Madraja, in any but the very smallest quantity (Bir Mala'ut dry), though it is very probable that water may exist at the foot of the Juhaili hills. They own flocks of goats and purchase what grain IhQY ^g0 They have the reputation of shameless highway robbers, the mouth of the Akkan, and the Tiban at Tannan near Nubat Dakim, being particularly dangerous places for small bodies of travellers. JUHAILI— Inhabiting the eastern extremity of the Kubati range and bordering on the west with that tribe are a small clan of about 100 men who have, since demarcation, once more been included among the Subaihi. Altough of Subaihi stock, from the circumstance of their living actually on the mountains adjoining the Kubati, they have for several generations fallen under the influence of the Kubati Shaikh, and have paid taxes to the Turks, when these were forcibly exacted from the Kubaitl. Their hills, compris ing some 5 small villages, are fertile and well-watered, and neither the country nor the people can be said to partake of the characteristics of the Subaihi. JURABI— The Jurabi, sub-divided into a number of sections and numbering between 300 and 400 men, inhabit the valley of the Wadi Ma'adin, which is by far the richest part of the SubishI country. Not only is the head of the Wadi a singularly well-adapted collecting basin for the rainfall rendered certain by the neighbourhood of the high Absi and Yusufi mountains, but a good stream appears twice in the Wadi between Mafalis and Kuhlan, by means of which the fields near the Wadi itself can be frequently watered in the dry season. There are several wells in the Wadi itself as well as at Ghurik and at Habil-us-Sabt. Groves of date-palms are numerous, most of the produce being sold wholesale by the ' tree ' to contractors from Aden. The staple rain-crops are jowari and hajri ; good irrigated crops of Indian corn were being cut at the end of February. Sesamum, mus tard seed used for making oil-cake, and a few limes are also grown. Although some 600 transport camels were stationed for nearly two months in the^ Wadi Ma adin, no diffi culty was experienced in supplying them with Jcarbi, while the camel-men and others ' dependent on native supplies were able to obtain all they required at very reasonable rates. There was not much demand for meat, the troops being supplied with Somali sheep and goats from Aden, but beef of fair quality was procurable locally, and the Arab breeds of sheep and goats were plentiful. The sheep, although affording good mutton, are small, and cost, usually, 4 dollars a head. Several large markets are held near the Jurabi border, the only one actually in Subaihi territory being Suq-us-Sabt (Saturday) in the Wadi Ma'adin at Ghurik. Others held are a Wednesday market in the Humaidi country in Wadi Ma'bak, one near the Athwari border, and one near the Koraihi villages below Mafalis. Country produce, animals, etc., are sold, as well as imported goods such as cloths, sugar, cheap cigarettes, etc. Arm s and ammunition are also procurable, the chief market for these being Suq-ur-Rabu in the Humaidi (Turkish) country. A Legras carbine costs 14 dollars, about 12 rounds of ammunition going to the dollar. The Jurabi are well armed, and should be a powerful tribe well able to resist the encroachments of the Turkish tribes, but they are much weakened by internal dissen- tions, which prevent their co-operating, except in case of actual hostilities. At the present time (1904) a stubbornly prosecuted blood-feud exists between the Atawi and Mifyahi sections, with the result that the latter have been unable to obtain access to the stream to irrigate their fields for two years, can raise no crops and their palm-trees are72 ADEN dying, but neither the Qadlus nor other influential men have [succeeded in adjusting:; matters. * The two streams—the Ghail Akashi and the Ghail Maula—-as well as being the life of the country, are also the cause of most of the internal disputes. They are each con trolled by a tribesman bearing the hereditary designation of the ' Sid-ul-Ma ' or con troller of the water, to whom the various sections pay dues for the use of it. The water is diverted now to this, and now to that, bank, and allotted to the various individuals for a specified time, being led by artificial channes to the land to be irrigated. Attempts- to divert or obtain an unfair share of the water lead to quarrels in the first instance, with a blood-feud to obtain for years. Treacherous murders in pursuit of these feuds are common and several occurred during the stay of the Commission in the Wadi Ma'adin. One of the Subaihi Qadhis, Thabit Abu Bakr lives with the Jurabi at Habil-us-Sabt near the Sanawi Shrine, the principal Qadhi living in Wadi Ma'bak with the Humaidi, Theoretically, disputes, etc., are submitted for their arbitration, but the Subaihi are an unruly people and not addicted to agreeing with a decision which does' not fall in with inclination. Baggage camels are owned by the Jurabi as also by the Wahasha tribes, lower down the W adi, but they are not numeroua. KA'AITI— The country in possession of the Ka'aiti lies on the north coast and includes the porta of Shehr and Mukalla. Behind the coast district are bare downs r known as ' Jol' ,, that rise to over 6,000 feet. Shthr^^andHaSi 08 ^ 8 ^ ^ ^ there are sul P hur s P rin gs at The coast district is well cultivated. Mukalla, the capital, is supplied with water from Al-Bakarain, some four miles distant. In 1887, the Ka'aiti Jemadar kept up an armed force of about 1,800 men in time of peace, to which he could add largely in case of war. He possessed a steamer, a ship and six or seven for offensive purposes. At Shehr there is a civil governor assisted by a police magistrate. In the villages petty cases are settled by the Shaikhs appointed by the Jemadar, all important matters being referred to the Jemadar. Revenue.

They live in towns and cultivate the lan^s around, trade with India and the Straits Settlements, and some of them are very wealthy. Thirdly, the Bedouins, who are scattered all over the country, do all the carrying trade and rear and own most of the camels. They are very numerous and powerful and the Arabs of the towns are afraid of them, for they make travelling in the country very difficult, and even blockade the towns. They never live in tents ; the richer ones have quite large houses, while the poor dwell in caves. Fourthly, the slaves and freed slaves who have married and settled in the country. They are all of African origin, many are cultivators, others are personal servants and soldiers of the Sultan. The most influential people in Mukalla are the Parsi business men from Bombay, and here Hindustani is very generally spoken. KA'LULI— West of Mudariba in the Wadis Bitan and Ka'luli (also called W. Furrnkhia and Umm Lasb) are a small tribe of some 200 men. The Wadi Bitan, of which the left bank is bounded by a rugged spur of Jabal Hawab, contains a good stream, Ghail Manobait, which flows for about a mile above the junction of WadiHarhar, four wells and three or four towers at intervals, a few palm trees and a little cultivation. There is a good spring in rocky pools in a nullah under Hawab, about a mile to the east of Dar Talib. There are very few inhabitants, among them some Sufis, the majority of the Ka'luli living in the wddl of that name separated from the Wadi Bitan by the ridge of J. Ahmad, crossed by a rough little pass. Barb Dhamka. The Wadi Ka'luli contains 6 or 7 small villages with 4 wells and good strips of culti vation. The best water-supply is a stream, Ghail Funkur, 1J miles below Bait Umm Lasb, which contains good water and flows for about a mile. Lower down is another stream—Ghail Funi—giving a good supply, but slightly brackish. A well about a mile below, Bir Sulaimani, is said to contain sweet water. A fair quantity of harhi, and ordinary native supplies in sma^l quantities, are procurable. kas A di — The country occupied by this tribe is the western region of the Ka'aiti territory, having been conquered by the Ka'aiti tribe in 1881. On the west are the Wahldi and the Bedouin tribes of Al-Bahaish and 'Akabira ; on the north are the Kathiri ; on the east, the 'Akabira, Bani Hasan and Ahl-ul-Haik ; while the southern boundary is the Arabian Sea. The country is intersected by chains of hills. The whole area is estimated at about 375 square miles. The arable land between the chains of hills is estimated at about 8,000 acres. Date palms and sidr trees abound, tobacco is cultivated, and there are a considrable numbers of camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats. All important criminal and civil matters are disposed of by the Naqib. Matrimonial and succession cases are decided by the Qadhi. Murder is punished by death; homicide by misadventure by imprisonment while theft is punished by amputation of the hands and expulsion. Revenue. The revenue used to be derived chiefly from the ports which are now in possession of the Ka'aiti. The Kasadi were originally a sub-tribe of the Yafa'i. The population of the country is very mixed including Sidis, Akabiras, Hajiris, and in Mukalla many Hadhramis and a considerable number of Indian traders, Khojas and Bamas. The population is estimated at about 18,000 souls. C52(w )gsb ^74 ADEN The principal towns with their approximate populations are Mukalla (capital) Fuwwa Burum Khirba A1 Bakrain HarsMyyat Thikh Rukub Souls. 12,000 1,500 1,500 500 400 700 400 Mukalla, however^ with its dependencies is now in the hands of the Ka'aiti, who conquered it in 1881. The Kasadi, properly speaking, has no sub-tribes, but it has a sub-division, called the Nakhkhabin. kath I ri— The country inhabited by this tribe was formerly of vast extent, extending from the 'Aulakl on the west to the Mahri tribe on the east, and including the sea ports of Mukalla and Shehr. Civil wars led to interference by the Yafa'i, and much territory has come under the rules of the Kasadi and Ka'aiti within the last half century. The Kathiri now possess no port at all. The capital is Terim. The tribe is supposed to number 7,000 fighting men. They are said to be a warlike and courageous people, and extremely loyal to their chief. The Kathiri are enterprising travellers and are found scattered over various parts of India, Java, Singapore, and Aden, also in other parts of Asia and Africa. The total population is not known. The principal towns are;— Terim (capital). Al-ghuraf. Sirvun. Tariba. Bur. Maryamih. Tiris. Al-ghurfa. mahr I — The Mahri territory extends along the coast from near Masna' to Damkut. Inland the country is believed to consist of sandy steppes, but its boundaries are unknown. The men carry a sword, which is never sheathed, and are armed with a stick, sharp pointed at each end, which they use very dexterously. They also use stones as' weapons of offence. The Sultan usually resides at Qishn and is represented at Soqotra by one or more of his nephews. Blood money is accepted for murder, but the heirs may take revenge if it is not paid. There is generally a Qadhi in each village, who only performs marriage ceremonies. The Mahri tribes are almost certainly survivors of the oldest Arabian race, forced out of richer lands in the south by the Semitic peoples. They speak a tongue which is distinct from Arabic and not Semitic in origin, practice animistic cults, and have the superstitious habits of a refugee population. The poorer classes show great indifference to religion and many are unable to repeat the prescribed forms of prayer. The popu lation of Soqotra is estimated at 9,000 souls, while that of the mainland including many Bedouin tribes, is reported to amount to 50,000. Qishn is the capital and the residence of the Sultan. The other principal villages of the mainland are Dafkut, Jubail, Shin, Shanhit, Wadi, Daghbarit, Kidifut, Kaish, Khartanut, Harut, Haswain, Mokhaifik, Saihut.ADEN 75 Qishn and Soqotra belong to the Ahl 'Afrir, a Mahri tribe that does not number above 20 persons.

The only two wells known (Bir Ghassan in Wadi Alasan and Bir Marasa) contain a poor supply of water. A ravine—al-Kadi—near the foot of the Kubati hills north of Dar Murshid Nasir, is reported to contain a good supply of water but there was no op portunity of inspecting it. Doubtless there are several water-holding ravines along tho Kubati border, but the suspicious and semi-hostile people keep their existence secret. mansuri—. Living in the neighbourhood of the Wadi Masharij, number about 300 men, and were formerly the most powerful of the Subaihi tribes, exergising effectual, as they still do (in the case of the Shujaifi at least) nominal suzerainty over the Shujaifi, Jaz'ai and Koraihi clans to the north-west. These clans held the position of ' Ra'aya ' or subjects of the Mansuri, to whom they paid tribute. The continual feuds existing among the Subaihi tribes for many years past have served to destroy the preponderating influence of any particular tribe, and to cause the small outlying clans to the north to fall almost entirely under the influence of the powerful Turkish tribes of Kubati, Absi, and Yusufi. The actual chief of the Mansuri is Saif ba 'Abdalla, a boy of about 14, his uncle, Salih ba Ahmad, administering his affairs for him. There is a little cultivation in the Wadi Masharij around the few scattered towers, and a little in the Wadi Sulaib. The only well in Wadi Masharij had fallen in, and the owner was given money to repair it. A good many riding camels were seen, ' dijr ' (wetch), which was plentiful, being the fodder used for them. MATARAFl— West of theHumaidi, live in the Wadis Mulaihia and Dar and border on the Kubati. The three stone towers in Wadi Mulaihia are evidently more for the purpose of defence than residence, the majority of the people living in temporary huts of karhi. There is a narrow strip of cultivation in Wadi Mulaihia and somewhat more in Wadi Dar near Bir Kurain, but it is entirely dependent on the rainfall, and when traversed in February 1904, did not appear to have produced a crop in the preceding year. The remainder of their country is very rugged and barren and with the exception of Bir Kurain, a good well, and some springs in Suaida ravine—-some 2 miles north of Bir Kurain and near the foot of the Kubati mountains—it appears to be waterless. The pools in the Suiada ravine, though somewhat difficult of access, would have watered (February 1904), at the least, 500 camels. Water was reported in two adjacent ravines, but there was no opportunity of inspecting it. The north-east Subaihi tribes are physically rather fine men ; lightly built, but very wiry. Many of them have good features and bright, singularly light coloured eyes. They are exceedingly ignorant and suspicious, and require most careful treatment to avoid arousing hostility. Most, if not all, seen were armed with breech-loaders (mostly the universal Legras carbine), and it is no exaggeration to say that their fingers are, figuratively, continually on their triggers. l276 ADEN The Matarafi own riding camels but not apparently in large numbers. Throughout the whole Subaihi country, the riding camels observed were all exceedingly young—-the owners evidently selling all animals of 4 years of age and using the young ones for their own riding, at the same time breaking them to the saddle. Curiously enough, this does not seem to produce the bad effect one would expect, as the Subaihi riding camel is much sought after ancl bears a high reputation for endurance. The Matarafi own large flocks of goats which they pasture at the foot of the Kubati hills. The blood-feud, which exists between them and the Kubati is probably owing to disputed pasture rights in the first instance. MUDARIBA— South of the Alkaml (Turkish) and west of the Shumaya, separated from the latter by some 8 miles of stony and uncultivated country, are the small clan of Mudariba, inhabit ing a fertile little valley traversed by the Wadi Umm Barhana, which, joining the Wadl Khosaita, forms the Wadi Turan. The majority of the inhabitants are Sufis and occupy a cluster of little hamlets, consisting of a tower and a few huts apiece, surrounded with date-palms and cutiva- tion near the junction of the wddls, where a good stream springs forth and flows at intervals for some two miles along the Wadi Turan. There are also two wells, and a third well with poor supply and some small springs in the wddl Umm Juail close by, Karhi is abundant. The people of Mudariba, adherents of the Julaidi Shaikh in whose territory their valley is, were found to be peaceable and well-disposed. About 7 miles further down the Wadi Turan is the village of Umm Shat in Buraimi territory but also inhabited by Sufis. It contains some 30 houses and stone huts, and is supplied by three good wells, one of which is nearly two miles up the wddls, one near, and one a little below the village. A stream, Ghail Rahban, rises in the wddi about two miles below on the road to Turan. SHA'B (Ahl)—- The Ahl Sha'b inhabit the eastern extremity of the Wadi Sha'b, which is very fertile^ They are a small community of Saiyids or religious sect, who have of late years come under the influence of the Absi Shaikh and through him paid dues to the Turks. They have now been included within the boundaries of the Subaihi. Their headman, one 'Abd-ul-Qawi, is a courtly and well educated old gentleman, who passed many years at the Court of the Nizam of Hyderabad and forms a curious contrast to his wilder neigh- * bours. SHUBAIKI— A small nomad tribe in Buraimi territory ; inhabit the desolate valley of the Wadi Tarbaha, to the west of the Wadi Ka 'luli: it consists of a stony plain enclosed on both sides by rocky and barren hills, is interested by numerous dry nullahs and covered with sparse vegetation affording grazing for the goats and sheep of the Shubaiki. Its average width is about 2 miles. With the exception of Hisi Ahmad, a deep well with a scanty supply of brackish water, there is no water between Ghail Funi in the Wadi Ka'luli and Ghail Kulaita in Wadi Hurrim, a distance of about 8 miles. There is no cultivation nor are any supplies procurable on the spot. - [Turbat-Abul-Asrar or Bani Surur, are a small community of Saiyids inhabiting a fertile little valley to the north-east of the Hawab range. The shrine there is of some local renown. There is a small village with three wells of good water and a certain amount of cultivation, jowari and date-palm. It is as yet undecided whether this settlement will be included on the Turkish or the British side of the border though the land was originally Subaihi. The valley adjoins that of Mudariba and fair tracks lead from it to the Wadi Bitan, to Umm Albia, and to the Haiki valley.] SHUJAIFl— This is not, however, the case with the Shujaifi, as mall scattered clan {vide Statement A, Mansuri), the villages in the Wadis Sha 'b and Yumit having been praiOtically absorbed by the Absi Shaikh, who collected taxes from them on behalf of the Turks. The Shujaifi in the Wadi Sha'b have been restored to SubaiM status, those in the Yumit remaining on the Turkish side of the boundary. Tnore is a small stream in Wadi Sihr near Nubat-us-Sihr and a good deal of cultiva tion around both Zaidin and Shujaifi villages.ADEN 77 SHUMAYA— Are a small clan living in Julaidi territory but now independent. They border on the Zuraiki in the Wadi Ubil, the boundary being just above their hamlet of Mijza, which consists of two towers and some huts. There are date-palms in the Wadi and cultivation, which they irrigate from a good stream coming from the Zuraiki country and ending just above Mijza. The stream breaks forth again J mile below Mijza and flows for about a mile. Umm Mijba and Umm Majarih are small hamlets with a little cultivation lower down the Wadi. From the Wadi 'Ubil on westwards, the inhabitants on either side of the border consist of small clans, on the Subaihi side living in either Atifi, Julaidi or Buraimi territory, in small valleys with a little cultivation frequently watered by small streams. Many of them were either originally, or have of later years assumed the character of Sufis, a religious sect of which the founder is buried near Lahej, but which has branches in nearly the whole of South Yemen, Adh-Dhubbayatinthe Amirof Dhala's and Shabwa in the Haushabi Sultan's country, being among their principal centres. This character confers certain advantages in the shape of immunity from tribal feuds, and to a great extent from the payment of dues to the ruling Shaikh. SUBAIHI— This large tribe inhabits the country bordering on the sea from Bab-el-Mandeb to Has 'Imran and bounded on the north by the Maktari, Sharjabi, Athwari, and other tribes under Turkish suzerainty. Although covering a large area, it is but sparsely inhabited, the greater portion, either consisting of sandy wastes with an occasional well and a little cultivation, or of bleak and rocky low hills covered with thin thorn scrub and intersected by a network of ravines, as in the north-east corner, water in both cases being Scanty and often brackish. There are, however, certain exceptions to this barren and waterless character, and these may be found in proximity to the border pf the Turkish tribes. The Turkish districts abutting on the Subaihi, from near the Naqil Madraja to the Wadi Ma'adin, situated on a range of fertile and well-watered mountains rising to altitudes of 6,000 to 7,000 feet drain southwards to the Subaihi border, which follows the foot hills of the range, by numerous well-marked wddls and it is in, and near, these wddls that almost the only fixed habitations of the Subaihi, and cultivation, are to be found. They usually select the hour of dawn for attack. They possess great powers of endurance and have a high reputation for courage, but are reputed to be treacherous. They own no horses and few camels, but the latter are of good breeding and very swift. They are a wild and independent tribe numbering in all perhaps 3,000 fighting men. There is, however, very little cohesion among the sub-tribes and combination between them on a large scale is, therefore, very unlikely. The Subaihi are mainly nomadic. They have no Sultan nor head Shaikh, and are divided into a number of sub-tribes with very little cohesion and frequently blood- feuds between them. The classes chiefly represented in the Subaihi country are the tribesmen, and the Saiyids, who are very numerous in the Wadi Ma'adin and in small settlements to the west (in the Mudariba valley, Turan, etc). The majority of these are of the Sufian branch. They are peaceable people and though many of them go armed are not, at any rate, aggressive. The 'Hajiri' are also frequently met with, and are a very useful class as messengers, guides, etc. The Hajiri are said to have migrated from a village of that name in the Hadhramaut. They are of unmistakeable African origin, and are migratory in their habits, travelling from place to place, and working at harvest-time, collecting supplies for petty trading transactions, etc. Of all the tribes in the vicinity of Aden the Subaihi approach nearest to the typical Bedouin character. They are divided into a large number of petty clans. Few of these devote any attention to agriculture, nor do they engage to any extent in com merce. Many members of the tribe, however, earn a livelihood as mulcadams orADEN The Julaidi are another tribe whose influence, originally widely extended, has waned of late years. Although numerically weak, and actually inhabiting a very restricted area the Julaioi Shaikh exercised influence, and exacted tribute in the past, from various small clans as far west as J.'Akama, some 30 odd miles only, east of Mokha. But at the present time, partly owing to the extension of Turkish influence from Mokha and partly to the independent spirit engendered among these clans by the possession of rifles although they acknowledge his suzerainty, it has become nominal only. Certain clans such as the Mudariba and the Aghbari, still pay a small amount, or more probably offer entertainment 'only, while others (the Mishwali, Bokari) have of late years paid to the Turks through the Shaikh of the Durafi. The JulaidS proper border on the Zuraiki on their (Julaidi) west, along the J Iraf range, and on their north, along the WadiDanuba, till the Buraimi are met near the Wadi Adim. Shawar is a village of some J dozen towers built on a hill above the Wadi bhawar, the Shaikh's being a large aiKl well-built tower. There is a well below the village. WAHlDl— In the vicinity of the W adi Haifa' near Hauta wheat, jo war i, barley, and fahat are grown. Four crops are reaped yearly, namely, pne rain crop and three irrigation. The fields are Hear and regular and the state of cultivation generally is very superior The rotation of crops is observed. The Wadi is for irrigation by numerous stone walls. There is an abundant supply of good water which is drawn up by bullocks after the Indian system. No fruits are grown except dates and lemons. The few cattle are sent to graze m the neighbouring deserts under the care of Bedouins. Sheep and goats are numerous, but there are no horses. In the neighbourhood of Habban the supply of water is very limited and procurable only from deep wells. The crops are therefore dependent on the rainfall. Wheat, barley tanaf, jowan, bapi, and Kimh (qinnab-dagoosa) are grown, but no dates, coffee, or cotton Indigo grows wild, also a species of aloe from which the common white rope of the country is made. ^ The only manufactures are a thick felt for eamel saddles and a coarse cloth for Dyeing is carried on extensively, the indigo being imported from Bir 'All and Aden!

The system of administration is patriarchal. The Sultans are poor and have little power. Their decisions m civil and criminal cases must be in accordance with the Mahomedan law and tribal custom, or they are disregarded. The Shaikhs are sometimes called in consultation, while, as a sort of court of appeal, a council of Sharifs or Saiyids may be assembled. The Shanfg have great influence even among the Bedouin of the hills, due m part to their descent and partly to their superior knowledge.

Possess ing in the neighbourhood of the Wadi Maifa a most fertile and productive soil they have settled down into peaceful agriculturists, fighting only when obliged to repel intruders. They hold their land on a feudal tenure, engaging to serve in time of war if called on. The Wahidi Sultans of Balahaf and Bir 'Ala can muster 600 and 2,500 followers, respec tively, but many of these are Hajiris. In the centre of the country are the ruins of Nukb-ul-Hajar, situated on a commanding eminence on the right bank ol the Wadi Maifa. It must once have been an impregnable fortress, and is generally identified with the Meepha Metropolis of Ptolemy, It does not belong to the Wahidi, but to a Bedouin tribe, who are perfectly independent; a wild and lawless people held in very bad repute. WAHIDi— The Wahidi are divided into 3 main districts— 1. HabbSn, 2. 'Izan. 3. Bir 'Alt The principal places of (1) are^— Habban, with some 250 houses and 2y500 inhabitants, situated in the midst of a plain about 3*000 feet high, Hauta, with some 200 houses and 2,000 inhabitants, on the Wadi 'Amakin. Ar-Raudha, Sha'b, Tirdan and 'Amakin, The chief villages of ^2) are— 'Izzan, with some 300 inhabitants, Kadur, with some 1,000 inhabitants, Lihya, with some 600 inhabitants. Naidia, with some 1,000 inhabitants, Radhum, with some 800 inhabitants. Other villages in Wahidi territory are RSs-ul-Kalb, Bir 'AH, Balahaf, and Ras-ul- Majdaha. The population of E€s-ul-Kalb is estimated at 2,000. Bir All and Balahaf contain very few T inhabitants. The harbour of B!r 'Ali is a small circular and safe bay, 1 mile long by 1J broad, exposed to winds from the south. The total population is estimated at Over 9,000 souls, besides a sprinkling of Jews and Hadramis. The Wahidi are one of the least aggressive tribes in the country and have for the most part settled down into peaceful tillers of the soil, or herdsmen, tending their camels, goats, and sheep. There are no men of wealth in the country and the general equality of fortune is very noticeable, except as regards the Jews. These are industrious, but very poor : they are not allowed to own land and are chiefly artisans, Avhife their women rear poultry. The population may be divided broadly into two classes—the settled agricultural and the Bedouins. The latter subsist on their camels, goats, etc., and what they -can get from the Sultan and travellers. There are.no nomads. A savage custom exists among the Bedouins of never accepting the ' diya ' or blood money. The higher Shaikhs, and most of the Sharifs can read and write but the rest of the population is illiterate. The inhabitants, as seen in Al-Hauta, are taller, fairer, and more slender than the ordinary Arabs, and wear their long, curling hair loose, or fastened behind with a band. Ignorant and superstitious, they are consequently bigoted and fanatical, yet by no means strict Muslims, very lax in religious duties, neglecting their daily prayers, except on Fridays. The women are very fair, with a slight yellowish tint, and go about unveiled, their hair being worn in long ringlets round the head. The ordinary food of the people consists of coarse jowari or bajri bread, with ghee and dates. Very little rice is consumed. The only beverage is kishr, an infusion of coffee beans and husks. Inhabiting Ar-Raudha in the northern Wahidi country are the Haiuq, an inferior caste of Arabs engaged in weaving.84 ADEN The following are sub-tribes of the Wahidi— (1) Bil-laksar.

The country ot the Yafa I lies to the north and north-east of Aden, and is divided into two main divisions hitherto known officially as the Upper and Lower Yafa' respec tively, Upper Yafa' being to the north and the Lower Yafa' to the south. The tribes themselves call the northern division the Yafa-'s-Sufla, or low, and the southern division the Yufa Ban! Afif, or Bam Kasid. The boundaries of Yafa-'s-Sufla ure on the north-west, the Marais country and Hajajia and Riyashia in the Turkish district of Rida; on the north, the tribes of Al- Husainia and Malajim under the influence of 'Amm Rasas, on the north-east and east, the territory of 'Amm Rasas ; on the west, the territory of the Amir of Dhala and the subordinate tribes of the Shairi, Halmin and Al-'Ajud; and on the south, the Yafa Ban! Kasid. Yafa-'s-Sufla is a country consisting of high mountains and deep valleys. The principal ranges of mountains are Jabal Shimr lying between the country of the Dhubi and Mausatta clans ; Jabals Shamsan, Dhl-Marsua and Zaivi, in the Mausatta territory : and the Jabal-uFUrr range forming the border between Yafa-'s-Sufla and the Baida country and Jabal-ul-'AII and Jabal Sulaiman in the centre of Yafa'. The principal river of the country is the Wadi Bana, which flows in from the north west, but there are several of its tributaries and small valleys which have running streams in them. Amongst these are the Wadi Hatib, the Wadi Jahami and the Sailat-us-Sih Water can be found in nearly all valleys during the months of July, August, and Septem- ber, the rainy season. The general elevation of Yafa-'s-Sufla is between 4,000 and 7,000 feet above the sea and the climate is equable and generally cool and pleasant. For limits of territories occupied by sub-tribes; see Chapter III, The country is fertile and produces coffee, warns (bastard saffron), cotton, wheat barley and wax in large quantities. ' The Shaibi clan grow a little coffee ; also red and white jowari as rain crops • and bv irrigation from wells, wheat and lucerne. ' Upper and, lower Yafa\ The connection between the two divisions of the Yufa'i is a real one in time of war or tribal deliberation. The Sultans of Upper and Lower Yafa' and the Naoib of the Mausata clan are regarded as being severally heads of the Yafa'i tribe and are supposed to unite and consult m time of national emergency. • The Sultan of Lower Yafa' bein^ of much older family than the Sultan of Upper Yafa', is regarded as the senior leader. 0 At the same time the rula of either of these Sultans is, in many respects, only nominal, and they have little real control over their tribesmen. ISTor can they punish or imprison the latter in the same way as, for instance, the Sultan of Lahej or Amir of Dhala. Also the power of the clans individually is great and they assert considerable independence of action. A clan or section of a clan, or groups or village, or even family, can and fre- q ^ en ^ c l ocs Associate itself from the general policy or general action of the unit of which it forms a part. The power of the Sultan of Upper Yafa' regarding tribute and revenue appears to be directly exercised over the people of Mahjaba (his chief town), the Da'udi clan of Al-Had and the people of Ar-Ku atain. There are many rival claimants to the Sultanate. + f nnnTti ^ FF- 0annot be estimated . that of Lower Yafa' is estimated at 8,000 doUars, derived from imposts on qafilahs and taxes, especially upon coffee.

The section of NaVa live in that town which lies to the north of Rub'atain. The population of Na'wa is about 4,000 souls, and they are said to muster 500 fighting men Ar-Razaim is a village under Na'wa. 16. The section of Jubani live in the town of and district of Juban with 4 000 inha bitants. Their sections are :— (1) Waisl. (5) Yahari. (2) Ishaki. (6) Ma'athi. (3) Darhani. (7) Hanjari. (4) Qadhi. (8) Thuwairi. The district of Juban is divided equally amongst the Shaikhs of the two families or houses. Those of the houses of Ishak own half and those of the house of 'Abdur Rub the other half. II. The second clan of the Upper Yafa'i in importance and numbers is the Dhubi. Their territory is the southern portion and they are bounded on the south the Lower Yafa'i on the east by the country of Umm Rasas, on the west by 'the Bo'si clan, and on the north by the Mausata and the DabianL The total fighting strength of the Bhubi is about 5,000 men, The Shaikh of the Dhubi lives in the town of Dhi Surah and his authority extends over the whole clan, with the exception of the Hadhrami, who are practically independent. It is divided into seven principal sections :— (!) Sum. (4) As-Su'aidi. (2) Sharafl. ^ (5) At-Taffi. (3) As-Salahi. (6) As-Saili. (7) Al-Hadhrami. The last section, as is evidenced by their name, have migrated to this country, from the Wadi Hadhramaut. 1. The section of As-Surri live in the town of Dhi Surah. They are 4,000 in number.ADEN 91 VI. Bub'atain lies on the northern border of Upper Yafa'. Its boundaries on the north are the district of Juban and Na'wa : on the east the Babiani section of Mausata clan ; on the south the River Bana and the Shaibi tribe, and on the west the country of Marais. The district has continuously paid revenue to the Sultans of Upper Yafa' for 200 years and is a personal appanage of the reigning Sultan. The total population of Rub'atain is estimated at about 2,COO souls and their fighting men at 400. Rub'atain is dvided into four districts— (1) Rubh-ul-Ilawi. (3) Rubh-ul-Sufi. (2) Rubh-ul-Akri. (4) Rubh-ul-Arami. Rubh-ul-Ilawi has the villages of— (1) Khulia. (2) Al-Kahira. (3) Bakhaita. Rubh-ul-Akri has the villages of—^ (1) An-Nubah, (3) Al-Karia. (2) Al-Lakama. (4) Al-Akr.

The Bani Kais section live in the town of Bani Kais. The Rafai Tarika section (originally from Upper Egypt) occupy the villages ;— (1) Kharba. (2) Arash. VII. The Shaibi clan is a large one whose connection with the main clans of the Upper Yafa'i is somewhat indefinite, consisting mainly of a doubtful claim by the Naqibs of the Mausata to tribute and military assistance from the Shaibi. The total population of the Shaibi is estimated at about 10,000 souls and their total fighting strength at about 2,500 men. The approximate boundaries of their territories are—on the west the districts of Marais ; on the north Rub'atain ; on the east Dabiani, Raw and the Muflahi; on the south-west the Muflahi of Khalla ; and on the south-east the Halmin tribe. The country is a high and broad mountain ridge with deep valleys draining north and east to the River Bana. The head Shaikh of the clan resides at the town of Bakhal; population 1,000. He Kas control of the following villages :— Population. (1) Yafhul ¥ . ..50 (2) Katid .. .. .. .. .. ..300 (3) Halaj ,, .. .. .. .. .. 100 (half belongs to another Shaik). Besides the head Shaikh, there are nine others of importance whose villages are as follows:— 1, (1) Dhi Kania (4) Amlah. (2) Al-Kaddam. (5) Ath-Thijr. (3) An-Nusaiba. (6) Al-Hahl. 2. (1) Anfad.

The total population of the Yazidi is about 2,000 and their fighting men 600, these figures being exclusive of the Naqibi. 6 ' Their head Shaikh resides at 'Ali Khadra. The important section of the Yazidi called the Nakibi is sometimes considered as a clan in itself, and its origin is Kasadi, the tribe who formerly ruled in Mukalla. The following are Naqibi villages W Hanakat-Dhi-Naqib. (4) Bani-'s-Siyal. 2 Madik. (5) Humlmma. (3) Rahwah. (6) Mudedha. (7) Al-Arakah. All the above 7 villages are situated in Sailat-Dhi-Naqib. I he Naqibi can muster about 400 fighting men.

ABDEL WAHID SULTANATE— The Abdel Wahid confederation lies immediately to the west of the Upper and Lower Aulaki Sultanates with whose tribesmen it is at constant feud. It is divided into the Sultanates of Bal Haf, Haban and Izzan. The Sultan of Bal Haf, who lives in the town of that name on the sea coast is Saleh ibn Abdulla, who is officially recognized at Aden as the head of the Abd el Wahid confe deration, and who receives a small subsidy from Government. He is well-conducted' anglophile, but without much influence over his turbulent tribesmen. The latter have an hereditary feud with the Bakazim, but lack their resolute grit and hardihood Pass age from one country to the other is dangerous, and supplies from Aden ordinarily come by sea. The Sultan of Haban, the chief mercantile town of the district, is JVasir ibn Saleh He is untrustworthy, and strongly opposed to any European penetration of his domi nion. He is unpopular with his tribesmen and frequently has trouble with the Lokamash and Ahl Iswad, two small but turbulent vassal tribes who lie between him and his here ditary enemies, the Ahl Maan of Upper Aulaki. The chief of the Izzan Sultanate, which lies 25 miles to the East of Haben, is Mehsin ibn Saleh. He is a man of about 45, unpopular with his tribes, a robber and a bad governor. He was expelled by the tribesmen in the early nineties, and after taking refuge with the Ahl Maan, went to Aden, Jibuti and Hodeida. Having tried in vain to raise money by pledging his Sultanate in turn to the French and the Turks, he returned via Sanaa and managed to reinstate himself. In 1898 he again came into disfavour bv endeavouring to blackmail the Austrian Expedition. ^ ABD EL WAHID SULTANATE— Officially recognized Sultan, Saleh ibn Abdalla of Bal Haf. Subsidiary Sultans : Nasir ibn Saleh of Haban. Tribes : Ahl Iswad. Lokamash. Mehsin ibn Saleh of Izzan. AHL EL SAIDI— The Ahl el Saidi are a small confederation bounded on the north by the Audhillah on the east by the Oleh, on the south by the Oleh and on the west by Yafa. They are chiefly to be found near el Dakhlah and the Saidi plain, and are the original owners of the soil under the tenure of the Sultan of Upper Aulaki whose influence extends as far as Karn Mershid. A land-tax is due to him from them, and is always withheld until he comes down to fetch it with a large force. This happens about every five years The chief Akil is Mohomed Ali Abu Awad, who resides at Nubet el Suwah and also* holds supreme authority over the Yazid who pay taxes to him. The Confederation numbers about 300 men, and are the nucleus of the following sub-tribes : (1) Ahl Diyan. Living at el Ain and el Hamerah. Their Akil Nasr Hamed lives at el Ain and receives a small tax from them, but they pay a far larger tax of96 ADEN 4 ushur' to Mohomed Bin Ali at Thuaren, a chief of the Ahl el Saidi, whose grandfather was formerly Akil on condition of receiving ' ushur ' from the Ahl Diyan, which was levied on land which they tilled, belonging to the Ahl el Saidi. The Akilship passed from that family, but the./ ashuwar ' is still paid. The Ahl Diyan muster bout 200 men and are an offshoot of the sub-tribe at Khaural, but may now be considered as component part of the Ahl el Saidi Confederacy.' (2) Ahl razaU—Living at el Dakhlah. They muster about fifty men. There are three more actual sub-divisions of the Ahl el Saidi, but they barely muster between them 100 men and are scattered throughout the neighbouring villages in most confusing manner. There is a settlement within their territory called Hafa, which is peopled by Sadah or Bayeds, whose origin is from Waht (Abdali country), where is the shrine of a well-known saint, Amr Abu Ali, who, it is stated, formed a friendship with Amr Abu Said (now enshrined at el Migdah) and was granted by him a small tax on the land round el Dakhlah, Which these Sadah collect. It is payable in kind as are all these ecclesiastical contribu tions, and is about 5 per cent, on the year's crop. There is a shrine at Hafa (Fatima B. Ahmed) and its attendants form the balance of the population. ALAWI— A small tribe whose chief village is at Salaik, about 55 miles north of Aden. They live just south of the Koteibi tribe, with whom they are on friendly terms; Early in January 1916 they were reported to have submitted with the Koteibi to the Turks and to be marching against the Fadli Sultan. AMIRL— The Amiri occupy the country round and south-east of Dthala, their capital. They are pastoral and agricultural and can raise about 1,000 fighting men of doubtful value They claim suzerainty over the Koteibi, but cannot enforce it, nor do the latter admit the claim. The Emir is Nasir ibn Shaif ibn eif, who lives at Dthala and is the son of the Emir who attended the Delhi Durbar during the Boundary Commission in 1902. He is a man of 36, good-natured, thriftless, easily influenced, and of no marked ability. He has two brothers, Ali and Seif, the latter of whom is said to possess a considerable amount of energy and character. The ruling house is unpopular with the tribesmen. When the Turks appeared in 1915 they took from him some 14 or 15 hostages and deprived him of his position. Towards the end of the year they summoned him to Lahej and made a settlement by which they released the hostages, keeping his son in their stead, and reinstated him with the gift of 50 rifles. It is, doubtless, owing to this that the Koteibi and Alawi have been coerced into joining them. Sheikh Kasim of Zubey, who accompanied him to Lahej, received a gift of 10 rifles. Clans are Azraki, Mihrabi, Ahl Ahmed, Shairi (Sheikh) Sameh Salim. AKRABI— A small and peaceably disposed tribe, ranging north of Aden lagoon and west of Bit Ahmed, the tribal capital. Here is the residence of the local Sultan, the tall mud tower of which can be plainly seen from Aden harbour. The inhabitants are agricultural and pastoral and can muster 500 fighting men- It is now known what their recent attitude has been, but presumably pressure from their powerful northern neighbours, the Subaihi, and from the Turks has brought them in temporarily on the side of the latter. AHL KARAB^— The Ahl Karab is a nomad tribe ranging the desolate tracts north of Upper Aulaki and penetrating as far west as Behan el Jibab and the Musabein country. They are a tribe of marauders and robbers, and though nominally vassals of the Upper Aulaki Sultan, are always at war with the Ahl Hammam. Their Chief is Hamid Ibn Nasir Abu Kateyan, who lives at Shabwa, a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, some 55 miles north-east of Nisab, built on the ruins of an ancient Himyarite city. They muster 400 men.0 ADEN 97 AUDHILLAH— The Audhillah is a predatory tribe mustering 5,000 fighting men, including Asakir and inhabiting the Kaur, the main ridge of the Aden Hinterland. It is bounded on the north by the Beda Sultanate, on the south by the Oleh confederation of Dathineh, on the east by the Aulaki, and on the west by Yafa. The tribesmen are mainly pastoral, but cultivate sufficient barley for their needs. They hold a weekly market at Loder, near the south foot of the Khaur, which the neighbouring tribes attend uncler a mutual understanding of neutrality. Here lives their Sultan, Kasim Ibn Hamed el Gaber, a man who is powerless to crub their freebooting tendencies, but who provides the only ready channel by which the tribe can be approached. The only man who exercises any real influence is Muhammed ibn Muhammed Abdulla, Akil of the Kaur, a powerful chief whom, owing to the natural strength of his fortress, it is almost impossible to reach or con strain. The chief tribe is the Ahl Deman— Audhillah Confederation, 3,000. Sultan—-Kasim ibn Hamid Gaber. Akil—Muhammed ibn Muhammed Abdulla. Tribe, Ahl Deman {Akil, Ali Amr, living at De- man).

UPPER AND LOWER AULAKI— The Aulaki country is inhabited by a large tribal confederation, divided for political purposes into the Sultanates of Upper and Lower Aulaki, but maintaining close inter tribal relations and uniting in the event of any aggression from outside. It extends from the edge of the Ruba el Khali to the Aden Gulf, and is bounded on the east by the Abd el Wahid Sultanate and on the west by the Sultanates of Beda, Audhillah, Oleh, Yafa, and Fadli. The inhabitants are mainly pastoral and semi-nomadic, but there are large tracts of arable land, while the main Wadis all have their settled popula tion. The history of the confederation is as follows :—From the Prophet's epoch (or still earlier), the Nisab Sultanate was in the hands of the Um-Rusas dynasty of Beyda, while the whole of Wadi Yeshbum (then called Wadi Kahai) was under the Sultanate of Abd el Wahid, whose capital was then at Haban. Wadi Yeshbum seems to have then been inhabited chiefly by raya, who paid taxes to the Abd ul Wahid dynasty. The Ba Kazim were then confined to Heyd Herif (a part of the Utheyli system) while Ahwar and district was in the hands of a tribe called the Ahl Zedi. Soon after the Prophet's death considerable political dissension seems to have occurred in the land of Jauf, where dwelt the remnants of the ancient and powerful Minean dynasty, which flourished before the Sabean kingdom, owing to the death of the para mount chief, named Maan. The house of Maan was much persecuted and fled th© country, together with two branches of a former ruling chief named Saleh, whose descent was as follows: SALEH. Nas. A Son (killed in Jauf). Farid. Ali. Abdullah,ADEN 99 These three clans, the Ahl Abdullah, Ahl Ali, and the Ahl Maan, wandered across the outskirts of the Great Desert until they came upon Wadinyeshbum, where they settled side by side with the raya of Abd ul Wahid on the spot where now stand Wasitah and Said. They had, of course, to become raya themselves, as they were aliens under the protection of another Sultanate, and for many years they paid tribute to the Sultan of Haban. In the course of time, however, they increased enoroumsly in numbers, and the Ahl Maan left the Wadi and adopted a pastoral and semi-nomadic life in the mountains, leaving the two branches of Minasar Bu Saleh still settled in the Yeshbum Valley. About the middle of the sixteenth century these latter became very discontented with their lot owing to excessive taxation, and in A. IX 1590 they persuaded the Ahl Maan to join them in an attack on the Um-Rusas dynasty at Nisab, with a view to the annexa tion of the whole of that district. The Ahl Bunyar, who now inhabit the plateau of Dahr but then occupied the Nisab district .as well, fought desperately for their Sultan, but could not stand before the rush of the Ahl Maan, who were fighting for their very existence as a tribe. The then representative of the Um-Rusas dynasty at Nisab fled for his life, and the Ahl Bunyar were chased up Wadi Khaura with great slaughter. The Ahl Abdullah received the Sultanate, and from them the present Sultan is descended. Many of the Ahl Maan settled in this new Sultanate, as will be shown later on when considering the distribution of the various sub-tribes. The remainder returned to their pastoral life near Wadi Yeshbum, the Ahl Ali going back to their settlements in the Wadi. The Ba Kazim now realized that this alien race was becoming a formidable power, and having also views of expansion, sent a deputation to the Ahl Ali asking for their assistance in wresting Ahwar from the Zedi, offering them the Sultanate of that district. A famous diplomat and ascetic. Sheikh Aboid, whose name is still revered in both Upper and Lower Aulaki, arranged the treaty between the two parties. It was agreed that the Ba Kazim should have three-quarters of the arable land at Ahwar and the Ahl Ali the other quarter, the latter receiving the Sultanate. In the attack cn Ahwar the Zedi were completely defeated. Some tendered their submission, and are there to this day as mere tributary raya, and the rest fled towards the northwest, and no trace of them remains, although it is said that a small colony of them are settled at Jauf. The Ba Kazim then spread all over the country now known as Lower Aulaki, but never seem to have submitted to the suzerainty of their nominal Sultan, whose dynasty they regarded as aliens whom they themselves had pitchforked into power. After the Ahl Ali had left Yeshbum, one of the two divisions of the Ahl Maan aban doned their pastrol life and settled on the Wadi. This was the Ahl Ali Bu Hamed, the other Division, the Ahl Muhammad Bu Hamed, still following their nomadic life in the mountains. UPPER AULAKI— The Upper Aulaki Sultan fs Saleh ibn Abdulla, who lives at Medak, a short distance from Nisab. He is a man of 42, energetic and with considerable influence over the tribes. He was a signatory by proxy of the Aden Treaty in 1904, and has maintained his anglo- phile attitude during the present war by refusing to join the Turks in their attack of Aden. His descent is as follows :— (AHL ABDULLAH.) Awad Abu Abdullah. (The last Sultan who visited Aden.) 1 Hamed. 1 Abdallah, Sakkaf. Um Rusas. Saleh ibn Abdullah, His tribesmen are inclined to be predatory, and although he does not give his official sanction to their raids, he nevertheless connives at them and generally receives some of the plunder in an unostentatious manner. At the same time he keeps a firm control q2100 ADEN over his subjects, and only permits measures to be taken against turbulent and aggressive tribes whom it is necessary to punish. The Audhilah are always blockading the roads through his country, and the Ahl Beman have an evil reputation for acts of violence and oppression perpetrated on petty traders. The Elhin and the Ahl Biyan are similar offenders. The enthics of such measures are, of course, doubtful but it can at least be said that many tribes and sub-tribes abstain from predatory acts, deterred by th&lt;5 fear of bringing wholsale ruin and disaster on themselves and their fellow tribesmen. The two chief tribes are the Ahl Maan and the A1 Mehagir. The Ahl Maan, with the exception of a large detached section, the Ba Thoban near Wadi Khaura, east of Kisab, inhabit the fertile valley of Yeshbum and its surrounding hills. They are noted for their bravery and fighting qualities, and can muster about 5,000 fighting men. Their ruling family is the Farid ; its present representative, Um Eusas ibn Farid. He is a man of about 50, and has always been anglophile. He signed the Aden Treaty in 1904 He succeeded his elder brother Erewes, who was deposed by the tribes in about 1895 for intriguing with the then Sultan of Haban, Mehsin Ibn Saleh, and committing them to the sack of Haban a venture which they refused to undertake. His family is as follows (AHL MAAN.) N asr, Um Dheb Abu Bekr (killed at Seylan.) (killed at Lahej,) Erwes Ala'vi. (deposed). Yeslum (imprisoned for some time at Izzan), The Ahl Mehagir have no paramount chief. They can raise about 4,0000 fighting men, but their strength is not concentrated like that of the Ahl Man. They lead a more nomadic life, and range the country from the northern boundary of the Audhillah and the Kaur el Od to the desert stretches north of the Nisab and the wild country of the Ahl Karab and the Musabein, who pay a nominal allegiance to the Sultan of Upper Aulaki, but are ever swift to raid his tribesmen when an opportunity occurs. The most northern section of the Mehagir, the Ahl Hammam, are themselves inclinded to be predatory, and scour the Hamam Desert on the look-out for caravans. When the depredations become too frequent and obstructive, the Sultan of Nisab marches his troops into their country and quickly restores order, dealing out condign punishment on any raiding parties met with. The Hamam Akil, Hussein Abu Ahmed, has not much control over his people and cannot check marauding. In addition to his own tribesmen, the Sultan exercises suzerainty over the following : 1. The Bal Harith, who pay immediate allegiance to the Sherif of Behan, who in turn is under Nisab influence and pays a private, semi-voluntary tribute. 2. The Musabein, merely nominal. 3. The Ahl el Karab, also nominal. 4. The Ahl el Saidi, who pay him land tax under pressure. A further description of the above will be found under their names. 5. The Ahl Nasin, who derive their origin from the almost extinct race of Beni Hilal a few surviving representatives of which may be found at Heyd Hadhenah They number 700 men, and their territory stretches from el Hagr to Heyd Yeherr and to wards the southeast. Its limit occurs at Gol el Hairur, and may be sa d to lie alonff the Wadi Merkha within the limits named. The Sultan is Nasr Abu Thalib, who belongs to the Abu Thalib dynasty, an offshoot of the Nisab dynasty. His ^way'is, of course subject to the jurisdiction of Aisab. Farid. Xasr Balim. Harlid. Saleh, Um Muham- Rusas med. (present J Akil), Abu Bekr. Meh sin, Abdullah, Hamid. Um Dheb,ADEN 101 6. Three clans who are termed Asakir. They do not come directly under the Sultan; but are bound by treaty with the Ahl Maan to give their services in battle in case of a war. {a) Ahl Ba Zal, leading a pastoral life in the Kaur el Od near the source of Wadi Marbun. (6) Ahl Wahar, living at Heyd Keneb and Husn Makosrah, agricultural. (c) Ahel el Reyd, who occupy a district north-east of el Ark (the frontier village of Lower Aulaki). They lead a pastoral life along the banks of the Wadi el Reyd, which joins the Wadi Rafal just above el Ark, under the name of Wadi Malaik. 7. Ahl Ba Feyad, a powerful tribe, who are not related to the Ahl Maan, but are; bound to them by a mutual offensive and defensive alliance. They muster 600 men and live along Wadi Yeshbum, between el Sfal and the gorge of el Nakabah. Origin not knowm 8. Ahl Ba Hadah, another treaty tribe of the Ahl Maan, who number 300 men and and extend from below the Nakabah gorge to within a short distance of Haban. 9. Khalifa, a treaty tribe living on the western slopes of Heyd Hadhenah, a range to the west of the Hamani Desert, and mustering about 1,000 men. The fighting strength of the Sultan, including his Asakir or stading army, is as follows : Troops at Medak, Ni'sab, Wadi Durra, Wadi Abadan, Wasat, and Behan .. .. .. .. .. 1,100 Ahl Maan and Treaty Tribes .. .. .. .. 4,900 Ahl Mehagir and Nasain .. .. .. .. 4,400 10,400 In case of a great emergency the Sultan would, as suzerain, secure the services of the desert tribes lying east and north-east of the Hamam as far as human life can be sup ported in the desert. The Behan tribes would join as a matter of policy for they are too close to escape being crushed by the fall of the Aulaki dynasty. The people of Jauf would certainly throw in their lot with the Aulaki, for it has always been the policy of the Nisab Sultans to keep in touch with the parent tribeship, and Jaufi chiefs are often entertained at Nisab. The Khalifah of Hadhenah would also come forward, as a serious reverse to Upper Aulaki would cut them off from all their trade routes to Nisab, Yesh bum, and Haban. Lower Aulaki would follow the lead of the Ahl Maan, as between Um Rusas Abu Farid and Ali Abu Mehsin, the paramount chief of the Ba Kazim, there is firm friendship and also a defensive treaty. Only in the case of aggression against the Abdali Sultan would the Ba Kazim keep out, there being a close alliance between Ali Abu Mehsin and the Abdali Sultan. If the position of Dathineh is considered, it will be seen that the Oleh confederacy must join in or be annihilated, and besides, their sympathies are with the Aulaki. Under such circumstances the forces may be estimated as follows Upper Aulaki .. .. .. .. .. .. 10,400 Lower Aulaki .. .. .. .. • • • • 4,800 Jauf and tribes between them and Behan ., .. .. 12,000 Behan .. .. .. .. •. .. 6,000 Desert tribes, Ahl Karab, etc. . ^ .. .. .. 8,000 Khalifah of Hadhenah .. .. .. .. 1,000 Oleh of Datineh .. .. .. .» • • 3,200 45,400 The Ahl Bunyar, who number about 4,000, are excluded, as they would follow the Beyda Sultan, and some tribes, whose forces are not known, are also omitted. The supply of breech-loading rifles amongst those tribes has increased enormously during the last few years, and they have some good mounted troops. Their military spirit is undeniable, their history for the last century being full of martial episodes.102 ADEN LOWER AULAKI— The Ba Kazim with its numerous sub-divisions compose the entire tribal population of Lower Aulaki, and can put into the field about 5,000 men. They are a hardy and turbulent race, always engaged in petty feuds amongst themselves, or raids on their immediate neighbours, the Abd el Wahid, Fadli, and Oleh. They have a bad reputa tion with the other tribes on account of their fondness for drink and their slackness in religious observances, but are redeemed by their genuineness and bravery. They have no paramount chief, such influence as the tribe will pemit being exercised by the brother chiefs of the Ahl Ali section at Ghidabah, Fadl, and Ali Mehsin. The Sultan of Lower Aulaki lives at Akhwar, about five miles from the coast. He has very little influence over the Ba Kazim tribesmen. UPPER AULAKI— AHL MAAN— Ahl Ali Abu Hamed.

BEDA— The Beda is a plateau Sultanate north of ths Kaur, impinging on the Yemen along its western boundary and reaching northwards to Behan el Dowlah. To the east is the Upper Aulaki Confederation and on the south the Audhillah. Former 1 y its power was more wide-reaching, and in the Prophet's time, or even earlier, all the land round Nisab was in the hands of the Um Rusas dynasty of Beda and his chief tnbe, the Ahl Bunyar. This they held until the year 1590, when they were loroed back up the Wadi Khaura and to the Dhar plateau by the Ahl Maan and other tribesmen who now form the Upper Aulaki Confederation. The Sultan resides at Behan Um Rusas and can muster about 1,000 men of his own retainers and Asakirs. An unsuccessful attempt was made some years ago to enter into relations with him. The principartribe in the Ahl Bunyar, Boccupying Soma and the Dahr plateau. Their chief is Abd el Nebi Hussein, who lives in the fortress of Dhimrah, which guards the thirying trading town of Soma from attack. He is a man of about 50 years and, carries his influence beyond his borders to the Audhillah and Upper Aulaki tribes. He com mands some 4,000 men. Further north come the tribe of the Beni Yub, who used to exact customs dues on the Behan Jazab and Yeshbum caravan road until prevented, by the Ahl Hammam. They range along Wadi Merka and up to Rahwat el Ribbah The Ahl Azan, the third chief tribe, are chiefly pastoral, with the exception of the Ahl Omar, who are a trading and agricultural community.

Mehsin, Abdurrahman (present Amir of Mareb) adopted son and nephew of Hussein. The chief Amir at Behan is Hamid Abu Mehsin of Hakaba, who also resides at Behan el Jezab. He is an old man of about 67, crafty, but less powerful than he pretends. He is comparatively wealthy, entertains lavishly, and is very popular with the Bai Harith, among whom he lives for a great part of the year as a Bedouin, in the lower reaches of Wadi Behan. He acts as an abitrator and dispenses justice. As regards his outside relations, he is on bad terms with the Sherif of March. He has always been anglophile and signed the Aden Treaty in 1904. Neither he nor any of the Ashraf have any influence with the Musabein. The Bal Harith, Sadah, and Ashraf number together 2,000 men. The Musabein are said to muster more than 4,000 men. The sand dunes which surround Behan on three sides prevent anything in the nature of a cavalry dash for raiding purposes, but marauding parties (especially from the Hamam), frequently slipt through on saddle-camels and play havoc with the Musabein. The Bal Harith and their Sadah and Ashraf are, how ever, never molested. DTHAMBARI— A small tribe north of Aden, about 40 miles east of the Haushabi, whose Sultan claims suzerainty over them, a claim, which they only admit when it suits them. They have always given trouble, and in 1903 a British column methed out punishment to them for raiding the mail, and destroyed their fortress at Nakhlein. The chief Sheikh is Salim Hussein. They are reported to have recently joined the Turks. FADLI—• The Fadli are a large a,nd warlike tribe, numbering about 8,000 fighting men, who are probably well-armed owing to their large sea-board and resources. They are pasto ral and agricultural, and extend from Makatin (the Lower Aulaki boundary) to the Fadli border and British frontier line at Imad, where the tribeship is a mere coasteal strip and uninhabited. To the north is the Oleh confederation, over whom the Sultan claims a suzeraincy which is not admitted. In actual practice his power does not extend inland of the maritime ranges. The Sultan is Hussein ibn Hamed, resident at Shukra. He is an old man of 90, and thirty years ago was d,eported to India and confined in the fort of Ahmed Nuggar for murdering his brother Haidiah, who was then Sultan. Haidiah was succeeded by Sultan Hussein's son. The latter died about 1910, after giving much trouble to the authorities, and Hussein was brought back from India and proclaimed Sultan. He is unpopular with his subjects, and his grandson Abdulladin ibn Ahmed has greater influence and is anxious to supplant him. Sultan Hussein visited Aden late in 1915. afterwards returning to Shukra. In January of this year he was summoned to Lahej and received by Saud Pasha with a guard of honour and a salute of guns. HeADEN was still there in February, and is said to have been promised by the Pasha some 200 acres of the cultivated land belonging to the Sultan of Lahez doubtless as a bait to other chiefs who are still wavering. The Fadli Sultan is in a favourable position, owing to the convergence of several caravan routes from the rorthern and eastern district, to collect onerous transit dues and hampur traffic generally. The cadet of his house in Abyan, which owes its fertility to W. Bana, and other streams between the Fadli and Aden, have always been independent of him, and bleed the unfortunate traders a second time before they can pass. The chief tribe is the Merkushi, who live round J. el Ures and the neighbouring hills. The attitude of the Sultan in the present war has been Anglophile and lately he is re ported to have cast into prison his grandson, of Abyan, who had quarrelled with him and was intriguing with the Haidara Mansur to join the Turks. In 1916 the Turks were reported to be marching against him with the Koteibi and Alawi whom they had won over to their cause. FADLI— Sultan. Tribes. Round J. Ures. Hussein ibn Hamed of Shukra ..

ADlM (Wadi)— One of the many valleys which have their heads in the high plateau of Haibal Qabrain and run towards the main Hadhramaut valley. The curious feature of most of these valleys is the sudden and rapid descent into them. They look as if they had been cut out of the plateau like slices out of a cake. In the valleys themselves there is very little slope ; and most of the valley heads, with the exception of that of Wadi Adim, are of a nearly uniform height with the main valley. Their sides are walls of rock nearly 1,000 feet high, and eaten away as it were out of the plateau. The Wadi Adim, which is the property of the Jabberi, is fruitful and rich, and there are miles of palm groves. It is about 100 feet higher than the Wadi-bin-'Ali, the gra dient of the bed being greater, and the mountains on each siie lower. It is the most frequented caravan route between the Hadhramaut and Shihr. At Ghail 'Umr there is a considerable running stream, which comes from a minor valley called Loban. Above Sa'ah the wddi becomes narrow, stony and uninteresting, the bed sloping gradually but imperceptibly.

'AFAIF— A small mountain in the Hamad, or Syrian desert, situated just over half way between Baghdad and Damascus. It rises out of the Qa'ra plain and the old postal route between the two above-named cities used to pass just to the north of it.— {Huber.) 'AFAINAT— A village of the Nahr Shah Nahiyah of the Hillah Qadha {q.v.), ^AFAJ— The name of a large swamp or shallow lake fed by the Dagharah canal and known as Khor-al-'Afaj and also as Lake Nifar, 40 or 50 miles eastward of Nafaj, in 'Iraq ; from it a small stream called the Shatt-al-'Afaj flows out in a south-easterly direction and joins the Shatt-al-Kar at the end of about 10 miles. The hamlet of 'Aiaj is near the south eastern end of the marsh and consists of a collection of huts. The Shatt-al-'Afaj apparently winds considerably south of the hamlet and is only a few miles South of Tel Dilaihim. Between the latter and the Shatt-al-'Afaj is the hamlet of Al-'Abarah on the left bank of an irrigation canal leading off northwards from Shatt- al-'Afaj. 'Afaj is 6 hours from Shakaiyir and 3 or 4 hours from Al-'Abarah. The term 'Afaj is used loosely to designate the tribes inhabiting 'Afaj and its circum jacent villages. These tribes are falldhin and grow rice and corn round some of their settlements, such as 'Ibra. Their paramount Shaikh is at present Hajji Mushiir, with whom is joined his brother Mukhif. The principal among the 'Afaj tribes are the'Ajarij, Bahaithah, Hamzah, Makhadihah, Al Bu Nashi, Al Bu Rashid, and Shaibah. These people are described as courageous, independent, and fairly trustworthy, but are generally engaged in petty feuds.AFA—AFI 115 Another authority describes the Afaj locality as follows:— Afaj is situated on the eastern extremity of the Khor-al-Afaj and on the left bank of the Shatt-al-Afaj. It consist of a few scattered collections of huts which include a bazaar with some small Aops. It is a place of no special importance. The Shatt-ad-Digharah conveys water from the Shatt-al-Hillah to the Khor-al-Afaj, which overflows down the Shatt-al-Afaj. The northern portion of the Khor is shallow, while the southern portion is deep ; its eastern end terminates in an impassable swamp with tall reeds. The Shatt-al-Afaj leaves the Khor in an easterly direction and after 2 or 3 miles turns south by east. In flood its waters probably reach the bed of the Shatt-al-Khar, but normally this river disappears in the desert. At Afaj it is wide, deep and impass able except by swimming or by means of quffahs, of which there are a few available. There is no bridge. The water in the Shatt-al-Afaj here is perennial and always fit to drink, except that in the dry season it has an unpleasant tasle. Rice, wheat, barley and millet are cultivated in the Afaj district, which also supports large flocks of sheep, with herds of cows and buffaloes. Camels are procurable at certain seasons. Routes connect Afaj with Bghailah, Mahairijah and Qal'at Sikr : there is a route both on the north and the south side of the Khor connecting Afaj with the Shatt-al-Hillah. AFAL (W adi)— An important watercourse, in north-western Hejaz, which is a right-bank tributary of the Wadi 'Ainunah {q.v.)

The 'Afar include representatives of many sections. 'AFARIN (T ribe)— See 'Ataibah (tribe); a sub-division of the Roqah section. 'AFFAR— A mountain village in Yemen, lying nearly 50 miles north-west from Sana*a. AFI— A village in Wadi Ma'awal (q.v.) in the sultanate of 'Oman. 'AFlF— A well known watering-place in southern Najd, on one of the main routes between Qasim and Mecca. It is situated about 150 miles south-south-west from 'Anaizah, and, though it has an elevation of 4,615 feet, lies in a hollow encompassed by low, basaltic mountains. There is one good well, lined with dry, rude masonry, and containing fairly abundant water at about 60 feet. 'AFIQ-AL-ASMAR— Some hills in Hejaz, to the north-west of Qal'at Dar-al-Hamra. The Hejaz rail way runs along the foot of the eastern slopes of these hills, of which the elevation is report ed to be about 4,500 feet above sea-level. 'AFISAH— One of the Aulad Wasil families of the Braih division of theBani Mutair {q.v.). Q2115 AFLlJ AFLAJ— Or Aflag, sometimes called with greater precison Aflaj (or Aflag) ad-Dawasir. A district of Southern Najd descending from Jabal Tuwain on the west to the Dahanah desert on the east; north of it lie the districts of Hautah and Kharj, and on the south a great depression called Maqran divides ft from the Ruba'-al-Khali. There is no means; of determining the real size or exact positron of Afiaj, but it is stated to'be several caravan days in length from east to west and the centre of Farshah, which is one of its sub-divi sions, is said to be 2 or 3 days south of the centre at Kharj. Divisions and physical features. —The Aflaj district consist of several tracts differing in their characteristics and distinguished by names. Near the western end is Hadhafab a region enclosed by Jabal Tuwaiq on the west and by Jabal Kirk probably, but not certainly, a spur of Jabal Tuwaiq—on the north; Hadhafah is described as unin habited and covered with thorny jungle and is perhaps the part of Aflaj which lies- between the hill villages mentioned in the topographical table below and the other villages further to the eastv If this assumption is correct, Hadhafah is seamed by a series of parallel valleys which run eastwards from the hill villages of Aflaj to those of the pfain, conveying the drainage of the hills. Of these, the northernmost is one which descends to Wusailah from Haradhah and is joined between Wusailah and Ghail by another coming from Starah and Gbail 5 the third passes Hamar and Wasit on its way to Kharfab and Saih ; a fourth has its rise near Haddar and ends near Badi' ; the southernmost begins at Shutbah, and arrives by way of 'Ijliyah at Hinu, which is also in the neigh bourhood of Badi% On the east of Hadhafah is Aflaj proper, the most important subdivision of the Aflaj district; it resembles Hadhafah in being bounded on the north by Jabal Birk, a pass in which—called Salamiyah—connects it with the district of Hautah. The plain villages of Aflaj are all situted in this part of the district; their names and positions will be found in the topographical table at the end of this article.. Besides the numerous wells irrigating date plantations and gardens, Aflaj proper is said to contain as many as 14 springs. One of these, called Yahmum, rises a short distance to the east of Rajaijiyah village and forms a stream, which, after flowing about 3 miles, leaves a tall black hill on its left bank and continues on its way through stony ground until it is absorbed by sandy soil at a dis tance of about 20 miles from its source. Next below and to the east of Aflaj proper is the Farshab tract,, on the northern side of which the Jabal Birk spur at length dies away and ceases to form a barrier between Aflaj and Kharj. Farshah has numerous wells and some wheat is grown, but there are no trees or villages ^ cultivation^ where it exists, is defended by small ports, Farshah is followed on the east by Biya lhah, attract which is adjoined on the north by Sahabah. Biyadhah contains no springs or wells, but there are Sidr and other wild trees and some grazing. Apparently at the south-eastern comer of Biyadhah is a pro minent, dark-coloured hill named Da'ajah, having wells to which Bedouins resort. East of Biyadhah again is Haraisan ; Da'ajah, just mentioned, marks the point of transition from the somewhat sandy surface of Biyaihahto the more pebbly ground of Haraisan. The flood water of Haraisan is carried estawards into the Dahanah by a depression, called Mahammil, which is barren but contains some grazing. Shutbah, a tract sstuated'in a recess in the eastern flank of Jabal Tuwaiq and contain ing a village of the same name, is generally reckoned to Aflaj ; but it lies in the direction of Widyan Dawasir and is included by some authorities in that district; its drainge appears to escape north-eastwards into the neighbourhood of Bail' in Aflaj proper. We may note that the Aflaj district is apparently skirted on the south throughout a considerable proportion of its length by a depression called Jadwat, which is to the north of Maqran and parallel to that valley, but of much smaller size. The beginning and end of Jadwal have not been successfully located ; but it appears to be shorter than Maqran, which is said to extend the whole way from Jabal Tuwaiq to the Dahanah, and it is positively asserted that Jadwal and Maqran do not communicate with one ano ther. According to some authorities the Jadwal depression receives a torrent called Harim from the direction of Bad!' and swallows up the Yahmum stream which, as we have seen, rises near Rajaijiyah. Maqran is said to contain large sidr and other trees and wells at which animals can be watered.AFLAJ 117 According to Palgrave, who states that he made an excursion in 1862 to its chief place, Kharfah, the district of Aflaj is conterminous with ' Airdh. He says that he crossed Wadi Hanifah and reached the boundary of Aflaj at the village of Safrah in one easy day's ride from Riyady. He heard at Kharf ah, which he reached in another long day, that the district of Dawasir began one moderate day's journey to the south again. He found the watercourses to fall southward and away from Wadi Hanifah after he had gone some miles over a broken calcareous platau (Tuwaiq). Though he nowhere explicitly states the relation of Aflaj to Kharj, it is clear the he place it west of the latter, and north of Hariq, Salaiyil and Dawasir, all these being bounded on the south again by the Great Desert. According to Lorimer, however, Aflaj is one conterminous with 'Airdh at all, but divided from it by Hariq. The only pint of agreement is its relation to Dawasir, Kharfah, thus, will be placed over 150 miles south-south-west from Riyadh. Some authorities prefer Palgrave's pisition for Aflaj to Lorimer's and place it south-west of' Airdh, with Dawasir, Salaiyil and the Maqqan depression on its own south-west and south ; and Hariq on the east. Palgrave's estimate would make its length from north-east to south-west not much above 50 miles. Fortunately, in their descriptions of the general character of the district, Lorimer and Palgrave are not inconsistent. Physically, Aflaj would appear to consist of scrubby and broken hill country on north and west, containing several villages. It sends down its drainage to a plain country on the east and south, containing the most fertile lands and the most considerable settle ments. Aflaj, therefore, lies partly in and on the southern Tuwaiq plateau, which sends off a spur, called Jabal Birk, to divide it from Hariq. All authorities agree that there is a good deal of spring water in the district, both in the hills and the western part of the plain ; that the settlements have gardens of date and other fruit trees, these beinr most luxuriant in the hill-villages ; and that it holds a considerable settled population. Population. —As will be apparent from the topographical table which concludes this article, the settled inhabitants of Aflaj are mostlyDawasir landowners and their cultiva tors of the Bani Khadhir tribe ; but there are also a few representatives of the Fadhul,, Sahul, and Sabai', and possibly of the 'Anizah and of other smaller but still distinct tribes, besides negro and half caste slaves.* The total'number of the fixed population of Aflaj may be roughly estimated at 22,000 souls. The people are Wahhabis. Agriculture and general resources. —The topographical table at the end of this article and the related articles to which it affords a clue contain some information as to the crops and livestock of Aflaj. It appears that the agricultural staples are dates, wheat, barley and lucerne, and in a lesser degree fruits, maize and millet. The fruit trees of the hill villages are superior to those of the plains ; but, in regard to livestock, the lower lying villages are the better provided with horses. The domestic animals are those of Southern Najd generally, viz., camels, donkeys, horned cattle, sheep and goats. Administration. —In comparison with the more northern districts of the Wahhab dominions Aflaj is backward and uncivilised ; and, in commonwith the neighbouring but still more remote district of Widyan Dawasir, it seems to play but a small part in the political life^ of fthe country. Aflaj appears to have been but little affected by the internecine * struggle, since 1880, between the rulers of Hail and Riyadh ; but it is stated that the Wahhabi Amir now extracts an annual revenue of about $20,000 from the district, of which h is paid by the Bedouins and | by the villagers. The control of the settled villages of the plain appears to be vested in the headmen (here called Amirs) of the principal villages of Badi,' Kharfah, -Lailah, Raudhah and Saih, each of them being answerable for the component hamlets of his group : in the hills, however, each village is independent of the others and subject to its own Shaikh, the only exception being Wasit which is under Hamar. ♦ According to Palgrave the half caste population at Kharfah In 1862 almost equalled the Arab in numbers and like full negroes, frequently wore nothing but a waist cloth. Hospitality was meagre, and a want of sociability and'a coarseness of manner were observable. It should be added that Palgrave's account of his journey to Kharfah does not inspire confidence, chiefly on account of the position which he assigns to it and to Aflaj with reference to adjoining districts,118 AFLAJ Topography. —The following is a table, alphabetically arranged, of the inhabited places in Aflaj :— Name. 'Amar Badi* Ghail Haddar Position. In the middle of the triangle formed by Lailah, Saih and Kharfah and about 3 miles from each of those places. r Ihe southernmost village in Aflaj. In the hills of Aflaj 15 miles to the north-west of Lailah, upon a depression which runs down east wards to Wusailah. In the hills of Aflaj at a distance of 30 miles (or possible more) due west of Badi' and perhaps 15 miles south west of Hamar. The drainage of Haddar apparently runs to Badi', Houses and inhabi tants. 60 houses of Mughai- rah, a shaikhly sec tion of the Fadhul, and 40 of Bani Khadhir who culti vate for them. The people are said to have come from Raudhah nearly 40 years ago, on account of a quarrel, and settled here. 160 houses, of which about 20 belong to slaves. 20 houses of Intaifat, 50 of Musarir and 100 of Wida'in, all sections of the Bawasir tribe ; also 20 houses of Bani Khadhir. Besides these houses there are many detached Qasrs pos sessed by the same tribes. Remarks. This village is inde pendent of Saih and its name has no connection with the 'Ammar section of the Dawasir. There are 2,000 date palms, all young, and the usual fruit trees and cereals. Lucerne and melons grow freely. Water is at 6 fathoms. The ordinary animals of Aflaj are kept, but there are no horses. The Amir of 'Amar is 'Abdul Rahman- bin-Shabib of the Mughairah. See article Badi.' The place is described as extremely un healthy for Arabs, and the date planta tions, which are very large, are said to be tended by hired cultivators from the plain villages. Water is from springs. The usual fruits, cereals and lucerne, are grown. Bedouins pillage the date-groves of the absent owners. This is the highest in elevation of the hill villages of Aflaj and also, apparently, the most remote. The march from Badi* is said to occupy 15 hours and to be broken generally at Dhaba'iyah where there are wells and ah abandoned »AFLAJ 119 Name. Haddar— contd. Hamar Position.

There are said to be 7,000 date palms and a few fruit trees, be sides the usual crops and domestic ani mals of Aflaj. The name is said to be due to the fact that the hills from which floods reach the vil lage are of a blood- red colour and that the flood water itself is red. There are extensive date- groves, besides the usual fruit trees, cereals, lucerne and melons; also the ordinary domestic animals and 25 horses. Water stands 6 to 7 fathoms below the surface. There are two routes between Ghail and Haradhah, one direct and one by Starah. The date trees here are estimated at 8,000 and the fruit trees are especially good. Water is at 3 to 4 fathoms.

AGAB (A l)— This place is reported to be the fourth stage on the nomad route between Tayma and Ma'an and is probably situated about midway between Jabal Tubaik and Ma'an.— {Doughty.)AGA—AGE 123 AGAIL— A community from the midst of the Arabian peninsula, mostly from Qasim. They inhabit the caravan towns and villages of Buraidah, 'Anaizah, 'A un, Bukairlyah, Khabrah and Rass. The Bedouins call them Al-Agailat. There are 150 dromedary riders of the Agail, armed with matchlocks, appointed to the Hajj service ; it is thought that they of all men are most able to deal with the Bedouins^ There is a Shaikh of the Agail at Damascus, through whom they deal with any government. [Doughty.) Leachman says that the name Agail was originally given to inhabitants of Qasim who leave their country to engage in business. They trade chiefly in camels, and carry on their transactions between Kuwait, Baghdad, Damascus, and Egypt, In Baghdad there are a number of Agail who have practically settled in that place, but every now and then they return to Qasim. Agail can pass in the desert without fear of molestation from raiding parties; and amongst Bedouin tribes they are received with favour, not only because they buy camels, but because they aid the tribe with their counsels in tribal matters. The name Agail is often applied to camel-merchants not originating from Qasim. The i^gail are the guides and conductors of caravans in Arabia. They are not a tribe but an organization partaking of the nature of a club or society or a masonic lodge. They have no connexion with the ancient Agail tribe of the Ahl-ash-Shamal, from whom the Muntafik claim descent; this seems to have disappeared and left no trace. The modern Agail are all Najd Arabs, townsfolk or nomads of any tribe from Hasa, 'Aridh, Qasim or Jabal Shammar ; but men of Sadair and the Wadi Dawasir are not admitted nor are members of any of the big tribes, such as the Harb and Ateibeh, who are engaged in interminable blood feuds, allowed to become members, the object being to keep the Agail society neutral. Settled Bcni Tamim and Bani Khalid of Najd and Qasim are most suitable for its purposes. The head-quarters of the society are at Baghdad, and its president, who is always a native of Buraidah, likes at Baghdad and there enrols the members. The Agail are of two kinds : Jemamil, camel-men forming the fraternity of caravan leaders, and Dhogorti, poor men, pedlars and mercenaries, who help to compose an ir regular cavalry under the Ottoman flag and serve as escort to the Hajj and as guards to the qaVahs, stations or halting-places, on the Hajj road. These last do not belong to the society. The true Agail are recognized throughout Arabia as professional guides whose presence vouches for a caravan of merchants or travellers and removes it from all suspicion of hostile intentions. It is the Agail who conduct the camel-trade of the desert, being employed by the dealers of Damascus to purchase from the tribes in Arabia, in the Syrian desert and in Mesopotamia. Such an institution as this society, with universal freedom of passage, is essential to the conduct of business in Arabia, where no tribesman, unless he be engaged on a raiding expedition, dare venture outside his own tribal territory for fear of hereditary feuds and enmities which imperil his existence. It is very dangerous for a European traveller to assume the character of an Agail: but Arabs, who with to shield the caravan in which the traveller is from molestation, will sometimes impose it on him (this was done to Shakes pear near Wadi al-Arabah in 1914). His best course, then, is, on the approach of any stranger, to feign illness and remain rolled up, face and all.

The length of Aja is about 75nr AJA—AJA 131 miles,* its breadth is about 15, and its general direction is from north-east to south-west. Its elevation is fairly constant and about 1,000 feet above the surrounding plains, but one peak (Jabal Fara') immediately to the west of Hail is 5,550 feet highf and so rises fully 2,000 feet above the town. There are no subordinate ranges or spurs of impor tance. The material of Jabal Aja is a course grained granite of grey, pink or reddish- brown colour ; the strata are inclined to the horizon at an angle of 55° ; and the sides of the hills, in places vertical, are generally so steep that the number of points from which they can be ascended is limited. Wells and springs abound; the hills bear brushwood and, in valleys where there is water, fine palms; there is also a tree resem bling a tamarisk in appearance, which yields gum mastic and is perhaps the Talh. A species of wild goat is found. Snow is seen, but not often, upon Jabal Aja, The principal features of the range are two ; first a remarkable enclosed valley in the east flank of the range near Hail,'called ' Aqdah, described elsewhere under its own n«me and second, a defile known as Ri'-as-Salf which pierces the range about 4 miles south-west of 'Aqdah and carries the ordinary route from Hail to Tayma and the west. The entrance of the Ri' on the east is close to Qafar and the exit on the west is near Muqaq; the distance between these points may be 20 miles in a straight line. The crest of the intermediate pass is about 1,000 feet above the level of Hail; the descent from it on the west is steep and rugged, and at some distance below the top on the western side is a place where cold springwater falls from a cliff. Minor valleys which descend from Jabal Ajaon its east side are in order from south to north; Umm Sinam, Taraf, Jau, Khashmat 'Awad, Ghamr, Ratawiyah, Ratawi, Mislah, Suq, 'Ariki, Shahriz, Baidha, Taraiq, Dabbi, Hijiri, Fahaidi, Jardi, Ahaimir Jasha'ami, 'Atun, Ghalghal and Tawarin. Those on the west face are Ruwaihli, Wubari, Dhalmah, H5mah, Nuwaiyah, Baidhatain, Daqalah, and Wakah. All these glens, except the first four near the south-eastern corner, are said to contain trickling springs at which the wild goats drink. In most of them are date palms, owned by Sham- mar Bedouins,| which flourish on the water of the subsoil; the owners, who live else where at other times, camp in the groves to enjoy the fruit from May to September and obtain their drinking water from wells which are numerous and often very shallow. The large valley of 'Aqdah is the only one permanently inhabited. Tuwarin contains Himayaritic inscriptions and ancient drawings on the rocks. 'AJAB— A section of the 'Ammar sub -division of the Al Hasan division of the Dawasir {q. v.) tribe. AJAFIYAH— A group of wells in eastern central Arabia ; they are situated in the extreme eastern part of the 'Aridh district and within half an hour of the edge of the Pahanah. Raunkiaer, who visited Ajafiyah in April, 1912, says there are several wells, 6 or 7 fathoms deep, but that the supply of water is not particularly good. There were then two encampments there, one of Al Morrah and the other of Bani Katan. The 'Ajman and Bani Dawasir also frequent these wells. Raunkiaer says :—' Where I have on my map the well of Ajafiyah, Pelly places a well, Abu Jifan; but my native authority informed me that Abu Jifan lies halfway between Ajafiyah and Hatha (near Jalajil), that is to say, just about the spot where the British map (India Office, 1910, 32 m. to 1 inch) puts the well of Rumhiyah.' This statement of Raunkiaer's informant is unsupported and no doubt incorrect. The probable explanation of the difficulty is that the true positions of the Abu Jifan and Ajafiyah wells are more to the north-west and south-east respectively than those assigned to them in maps. AJAIBI— A channel taking off on the right on the route Wadiyah-Abu Aran at 4J hours from the former. It leads to Azairij. ♦ ♦ According to Huber (Journal de Voyage, page 638) only so much of the range as is red in called Aja {\iz the portion north-west of Jafaifah) and the remainder is called Hazam. t As calculated by Lieutenant F.

'AJAJ (Abu)— 'AJAJ (Qal'at-al)— , ,. , t ^ Sometimes pronounced' Ayay. This is the only name by which the Portuguese fort on Bahrain Island is known among the surrounding villages ; but the townspeople of Manamah, especially the Persians among them, generally call it Qal'at-al-Farang. The Bents, their book entitled Southern Arabia, state that the natives now call this fortress Gibliyah, just as they do one of the fortresses at Masqat. The fort, a regular bastioned Portuguese construction of the 16th century, is now an untenanted ruin. It is situated on the north coast of Bahrain Island, 3J miles west of the Manamah fort stands about 150 yards from the beach, and covers nearly two acres of ground.

AJLANIYAH— A considerable village in Hadhramaut {q. v.). 'AJMA— A village in Wadi Tayln [q. v.) in the 'Oman Sultanate. 'AJMAN TOWN and PRINCIPALITY— Sometimes pronounced 'Aiman. A town on the coast of Trucial 'Oman forming,' with its immediate environs, a small independent principality of which the political position is defined in the article on Trucial'Oman. It is situated 6 miles south-west of Hamnyah and 5 miles north-east of Sharjah Town, on the south side of the entrance to a creek which, having a bar of sand not of rock with 5 feet of water on it at low,.tide is one of the most accessible on this part of the coast; the sea anchorage off 'Ajman, however, is bad. Fresh water for drinking is obtained from wells 9 feet deep, of which the locality is constantly changing. The population of'Ajman is_ about 750 so Is, composed of 25 houses of Na'Tm of the Qaratisah, Hamlrat, and A1 Bu Dhanain section, 80 houses of A1 Bu Mahair, 12 houses of Sudan, 14 of A1 Bu Kalbi, 5 of Masaibah and 12 of Shaqdsh. All the inhabi tants are pearl divers and fishermen : they own about 40 pearl boats and 25 fishing boats, besides some 60 camels, 20 horses 100 donkeys, 100 cattle and 400 goats. The plantations of the town contain about 1,900 date trees: there is no other cultivation. One or two boats are built here each year, but most of these in use have been obtainpri from Sharjah or Dibai. The authority of the Shaikh only extends 2 miles inland, and, upon the sea, IJ miles south-westwards and 2J miles north-eastwards, embracing on the last-mentioned side part of the tract called Zora: his dominions are thus an enclave in Sharjah territory. There is no dependent village, and no Bedouin tribe owes allegiance to the Shaikh, who is of the Qaratisah section of the Na'Im: a political alliance and friendly relations, however, generally subsist between the inhabitants ofAJM—AIM 137 s Ajman and the people of Baraimi; and the late Shaikh of 'Ajman was a maternal uncle of the present Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain. The Shaikh of 'Ajman derives a revenue of about Rs. 4,600 a year from the pearl fishers of his port, and he owns some date gardens at Dhaid of which the yield is inconsiderable. The present Shaikh, Hamid Ibn 'Abdu Aziz, who succeeded his murdered father in 1910, is of a rough and quarrelsome character ; he has given trouble by connivance at the illicit traffio in arms, and by an intractable attitude with regard to the proposed wireless station at Zora on the N.E. of his territory. Frindly relations usually subsist between the Shaikh and the inhabitants of Baraimi. A1-'Ajman Fort (Lat. 25° 25^ N., Long, 55° 27' E.) is a small but high structure ; one of the towers, from which the flag is flown, is much higher than the rest, and can be seen from a distance of about 12 miles. The water is bad, and obtained from wells a mile south-westward of the town Al-'Ajman sends 60 boats to the pearl fishery. Depths, —A bank with'2to 3 fathoms water,'extends 1J miles off Al-'Ajman, and there are depths of 5 fathoms 2J miles north-westward of the fort. The locality should not be approached to less than 10 fathoms, about 4 miles off-shore, at night. The bottom is rocky, and bad anchorage ground. The Mor.—-The easiest of access of any on this coast, and is used by very large boats. The entrance is close to the northern end of the town, between two spits of sand extend ing 2J cables from the shore; the bar, which is sand, has 2 feet water. Within the bar are two khors, one trending south-westward to A1-'Ajman, and Zora khor, the other, north-eastward, A channel, with from 6 to 9 feet water, extends half a mile close along the north-western shore of Zora khor, which then opens into drying lagoons. There are 2 fathoms water in the khor off the town ; the channel is near the town side, a bank extending half way across from the north-eastern low sandy entrance point. AJMAN ( Tribe)— An important nomed Arab tribe in Eastern Arabia. The singular is 'Ajmi; and in the mouth of Bedouins the name generally becomes 'Aimi (singular) and 'Aiman (pluraL Distribution, The head-quarters of the tribe are in the district of Hasa, where the tract of Taff, the southern half of Habl, all Jauf, and Biyadh as far south as 'Oqair Port are recognised as being 'Ajman territory. The 'Ajman also occupy the northern con fines of Jafurah and are generally found in Kharmah, especially about Zarnuqah ; their winter quarters are partly in Summan ; in the cold weather a few of them occasionally visit Qatar; and some of the Al 'Arjah and Al Shamir sections habitually camp in the Kharj district of Southern Najd, These are the ordinary limits of the tribe, but, when they are on good terms with the Bani Khalid, and with the Shaikh of Kuwait, which is not the case at present, they wander over the whole country as far northwards as Kuwait Town. Some settled 'Ajman detached from the tribe are found in Kuwait Town and there are a few in the fixed villages of Wa^i-al-Miyah. Religion, character and mode of life. —Tn religion the'Ajman are Hanbali Sunnis, By occupation the 'Ajman are pastoral; and they own many horses, camels, sheep and goats, but have not a large number of cattle ; their camels are bought by merchants from the north, and even from Syria, who visit their country for the purpose every year. The dealings of the 'Ajman are principally with the Hasa Oasis, where they dispose of their marketable wares, including horses, and supply themselves with the products of civilisation ; part of their dates, however, they obtain from the Qatif Oasis. Some of the tribe own date plantations in the oasis of Hasa, but none of them have any in Qatif. The tents of the 'Ajman are next in size to those of the Bani Khalid and are generally black with a white lining. About f of their population was destroyed by the Wa'ihabTs near Kuwait in the reign of Faisul. Co2(w)GSB m140 AJMAN To these may be added the A1 Jiblan section of the Mutair, who have separated from their own tribe and at present form part of the 'Ajman ; and it may be noted that the Marazlq of the Bhibkuh Di»triert of the Pe'rsian Coast lay claim to 'Ajman descent. In Arabia the various sections of the tribe are intermingled throughout their whole territory and have not separate locations. The estimate of fighting strength, amounting to 10,000 men, appears high ; it indicates a total tribal strength of about 35,000 souls, but regard being had to the wideness of the area over which the tribe extend the number is perhaps not excessive. The 'Ajman are said to muster 2,000 mounted men, all of whom are armed with Martini rifles, lor spears and swords are now hardly to be found in the tribe. Political position. —The 'Ajman, whom some authorities would connect with the Qahtan, state that they are descended from Bhurafa of Najran ; but their pretensions are generally disallowed, or at least ignored, for no special consideration is shown them in virtue of the origin to which they lay claim. On the other hand, their tribal strength makes their alliance valuable and their enmity a serious danger; but in politics they are a shifting and inconstant factor, being, as they themselves have been known openly to profess, ' the friends of those who treat them best.' At the present time the 'Ajman are on good terms with the Bani Khalid, the two tribes being mutually free of each other's^country ; and they have somewhat similar relations with the Bani Hajir, who, after providing themselves with Raflqs from the * Ajman, range as they please in the 'Aj mi districts. With the Ai Morrah, whose camps intermingle with theirs on the south side of the Hasa Oasis, the 7 Ajman are presently at feud ; and they were also at enmity with the late Ahmad-bin-Thani, Shaikh of the Ma'adhid of Qatar, but with Jasim, the senior Shaikh of that tribe, their dealings are amicable. As a body, theywere formerly well disposed to Ibn Sa'ud, but they are now at war with him ; and they are friendly as a rule, with the Shaikh of Kuwait. During the Turkish occupation, the majority of the Bedouin gendarmerie of Al-Hasa- used to be drawn from the 'AJman tribe. — [Leachman.) The following account of the 'Ajman brings out some additional facts concerning them. The 'Ajman, who range south of the Bani Khalid, trace their descent to Qahtan through Kafura of Najran; but this pedigree is not accepted by Arab genealogists in general. They are, however, an important Bedawi tribe, which is the strongest nomad unit on the Gulf Coast, although is claim to turn out 10,000 fighting-men is excessive. It is singularly at one within itself, its different sub-tribes and clans not having distinct dirahs, or falling into sectional groups. 'Ajmi tribesmen of all sections may be found in any camp in any part of the range of the tribe. It also appears to have unusual instinct for federation with its weaker neighbours, thus securing more elbow-room. At present both the Bani Kbalid and the Bani Hajir are its allies, and the 'Ajman have free tange in their dirahs. The whole tribe is well provided with breach-loading firearms, and being Sunni of the Hanbali school, it is sympathetic to Wahhabism, and has some of its dour spirit. Its proper summer range is the Gulf lowlands from Taff down to 'Oqair, enveloping the Hasa oasis on north and east. Inland it ranges back over the Summan plateau, where its herdsmen wander in winter as far west as the confines of Sadair; and at the same season 'Ajman push even into Kharj, On the littoral they straggle sometimes into Al-Qatr, and habitually wander north up to Kuwait, relying on their agreement with the Bani Khalid, whose proper dirah they thus invade. They are to be found, therefore, at one season or another, over an area of not less than 20,000 square miles. Very few 'Ajmi tribesmen have even adopted settled life, though they own some date- groves in Hasa. Their welath lies in horses, camels, and the smaller cattle. In particular they are horse-breeders. They may total between 4,000 and 5,000 tents. During the Ottoman occupation of Hasa and Qatff, the 'Ajman were consistently re calcitrant, in spite of subsidies doled out to their shaikhs, and the screw which could be put upon the tribe when, according to it custom, it camped near Hofuf, and wished to dispose of stock, etc., in the local markets. It maintained the while relations of old standing with the Amirs of Riyadhand welcomed 'Abdul 'Aziz Ibn Sa'ud when he invaded Hasa in 1913. But when his became the established government, the 'Ajman liked him and his taxes little better than the Turks, and he had to organizedrastic punish ment of their raiding in the summer of 1915. Their traditional for is the Aul MorrabAJM-AK 141 tribe and of late they hare added Ibn Rashid and the Shammar. With the Sultan of Kuwait and the paramount Shaikh of Al-Qatr they have generally, though not invanab- ly, kept on tferms. The paramount chieftainship is vested in the Ibn Hithlain family of the Ma'idh sub- tribe (Naja' clan). On the murder of Muhammad ibn Hazam ibn Hithlain in 1910, the chieftainship was put in commission ; but. Shaikh Fahad, the elder brother of the late chief, who had most support for the sole succession, is likely by now to have attained his ambition. His clan is said to be in close alliance with the Sifran sub-tribe which, though not numerous, is reputed to contain the most formidable of all the Ajmi nghting- men. * A J MAN - AR -R AKHM— One of the divisions of the Sabai' tribe (q. v.) of Najd.

From here Qal'at-al- Akhdhar is one hour's journey distant. The Arabs call both the valley and the tower Al-Khudhr. —( Doughty.) AKHDHAR (Jabal)— Position and extent. —A mass of mountains in the Western Hajar of the 'Oman Sultanate forming the highest portion of the Hajar range and dividing the district of 'Oman proper on the south from that of Batinah on the north. Its axis lies west-north-west and east- south-east, its eastern extremity being at Najd-al-MughbarTyah, the head of Wadi Samail, and its western at or near the head of Wadi Bani Ghafir. The length of the range proper is thus about 50 miles and its breadth on the average about 20 ; but it throws off from its eastern end a great unnamed spur which runs for nearly 30 miles to the north east and forms a barrier dividing Wadi Samail from the Wadi-al-Hammam branch of Wadi Ma'awal. Many parts of it are called locally after some town in he vicinity i.e., Jabal Nizwa Jabal Samad, etc. Configuration. The top of Jabal Akhdhar is described as a table-land which is highest, throughout its length, uponIhe side next the sea. From the crest the fall on the northern side is abrupt and precipitous ; but inland the plateau first declines gradually to south wards and then drops, by cliffs less remarkable than those of the seaward face to the plains of 'Oman Proper. The chief peak of Jabal Akhdhar is Sham or Wisham nearer to the west then to the east end of the range ; it is 9,940 feet high and is visible from the sea at a distance of over 100 miles. Another peak is Khadhar, 7,500 feet high, at the south east corner between Wadi Mi'aidin and Wadi Halfain, above Muti in the latter. One of the highest points on the limb of Jabal Akhdhar which reaches to the north-east is Jabal Nakhl, 7,000 feet. The northern flank of Jabal Akhdhar gives birth to the Wadis Bani Kharus, Fara', Sahtan, and Bani Ghafir which descend to Batinah ; while Wadi Mi'aidin and Wadi Tanuf, both draining to 'Oman Proper, are the principal hollows that furrow its southern slopes. Routes. —Routes across Jabal Akhdhar are neither numerous nor easy. The best know is one which leaves Wadi Bani Kharus near the village of ' Aliya (2,400 feet), and rises by an extremely steep and partly artificial road to the top of the Aqabat-al-Hajar (8,000 feet), the ascent oscupying, if local donkeys are used, about 5 hours ; from, this pass it traverses an undulating plain to the head of a ravine containing Saiq village, to which it descends about 400 feet by a stairway cut in the rock ; the way beyond Saiq lies through the adjacent village of Sharaijah, whence it drops into Wadi Mi'aidin. The other principal route across the main mass of Jabal Akhdhar is one called Tariq- ash-Shass, which leads from J Awabi to Saiq and Sharaijah and thence to Tanuf; it is narrow and inconvenient but, like that already described, it is passable by animals- Sharaijah is connected with Tanuf, 21 miles distant to the westward, by a route prac ticable for mules and donkeys, which could be rendered passable for camels ; to the east a difficult track, fit only for men and local donkeys, leads from Sharaijah over the south ern slopes of Jabal Khadhar and thence for about 3,000 feet down a steep stone stair case to Muti in Wadi Halfain. To these routes may be added a foothpath called 'Aqabat-al-Qatt by which a strong walker can cross the hills between Nakhl and Wadi Samlil in about 6 hours and ? Aqbat- al-Flq, an inferior route by which Jabal Akhdhar can be ascended from the north. Geology and natural products. —Jabal Akhdhar consists, so far as is known, entirely of limestones of the ? Oman series; regarding these the Appendix on Geology may be consult ed. In some places the rock lies exposed in large tabular masses ; in others it has hollows containing a shallow earthy deposit; in others again it is covered with good soil. The high plateau is stony, intersected by ravines and covered with grass i&amp; tussocks which must144 AKH—AKH afford good grazing after rain ; it bears evergreen bushes and even some trees of con 8 ^' derable size. Animals are the wolf, hyaena, wild cat and Wa'al or Jayakar's wild goat» birds are few, principally kites and vultures. Population, villages and agriculture. —The inhabitants of Jabal Akhdhar nearly all belong to the Bani Riyam and Habus tribes. The principal villages are Bani Hablb, Saiq, and Sharaijah in the hills and Musairah, Mi'aidin and Misfah in Wadi Mi'aidin ; of these Sharaijah is the largest and most important. The cultivated lands of these villages are generally terraced and irrigated; the crops include wheat and legu minous plants, but most attention is given to fruit culture. The hillsides in some places are covered with vineyards, producing white and black grapes which are made into wine or raisins ; and pomegranates are grown in great profusion and exported. Peaches, apricots, figs, mulberries and melons are among the other fruits. There are aso walnut- trees, and a kind of coriander called But which grows wild. Outside the villages posses sing irrigation the people are pastoral, depending for subs : stence on their flocks and herds, but they are not no nad e. The total population of Jabal Akhdhar, the upper villages of Wadi Mi'aidin being include'!, is about 3,500 souls. AKHDHAR (N ahr)— See Majar-al-Saghir. AKHDHAR (Qal'at-at)— A station or the Hejaz railway (?.r.), and a halting place on the Syrian Hajj caravan route. It is situated 38 miles south-east from Tabuk, and consists of a fort, and a triple cistern of which only one part, and that the smallest, is in use. The water is raised from a shallow well in the fort. Outside are a few wretched huts of Swaifli, who supply forage of coarse grass to the Hajj. Over the fort doorway is an old inscription in Arabic, engraved within a border, shaped like a Roman ensign board. Inside are some ru le scorings, and a shrine to Eiias. Near the station is a Wddi of the same name.—( Doughty), AKHDHAR (W adi)— See Qal'at-al-Akhdhar.

AKHDHAR (W adi-al)— A watercourse, in north-western Arabia, which apparently forms part of a system of waterways draining the country from Dar-al-Hamra, on the Hejaz railway, and the country west of the Tayma oasis, towards Tabuk. The upper and middle reaches of Wadi-al-Akhdhar are called respectively Wadi-al-Mu'adhdham and Wadi as-Sani ; Wadi-al-Akhdhar proper seems to begin some miles to the south-west of Qal'at-al Akhdhar. To the north-west of the latter, and at the southern end of a tunnel 200 yards long in the Hejaz railway, Wadi-al-Akhdhar turns north for a few miles and than re sumes its general direction of north-west. Near this bend many valleys meet and in undations are frequent in winter, the line being carried in one place along a raised viaduct on 20 arches each 10 feet wide.

[Doughy) 'ALICAl)— A town in Hejaz, in western Arabia, situated on the Hejaz railway between Tabiik and Al-Madinah and 177 miles by rail from the latter place. Doughty considers Al-'Ali to mark the northern limit of Hejaz proper. Though this name is written Al-'Ula it is never so pronounced, but always as Al-'Ali. This large oasis settlement lies on the south-west side of Wadi-al-Qura and is built against the steep cliffs of the Harrat-al-Muwahib. Before the Opening of the Hejaz railway it was a great halting place on the Hajj pilgrims caravan route. The railway follows the pilgrim route to the east of the valley and the station is at some distance from the town. Before the European war there was a project on foot to construct at Al-'Ali a railway depot similar to that at Ma'an. The inhabitants of Al-'Ali, numbering some 4,000 souls, are inhospitable and cowardly [ and the majority show African blood in their veins. Most of them go about armed. The inhabitants are known as 'Alowna, the singular form being 'Alowi. The town itself is narrow and about a third of a mile in length, but* the cultivated oasis extends above and below it to a total length of two miles and right across the wadi. It is walled on the south-west side, where it adjoins the desert, and there are two main gates besides smaller doors; it is Open on the side of the oasis. The houses are well constructed of stone, but the streets are narrow and darkened by the upper stories, built high to gain some freshness in the stagnant air of the wadi, shut off as it is by the hurrah from the western sea-wind. There is no open bazaar, but daily provisions are sold after sunrise at the street-corners. Butchers sell mutton and goat-flesh outide the walls • the street are kept very clean. The date-plantataions and fields are irrigated by a lukeworm brook and by some smaller springs which rise in the oasis. All the water is tepid and sulphruous, the temperature of the main stream being 92° F. ; in it the villagers wash themselves, and there are enclosed bathing placs for the women. The women go closely veiled. Where the valley begins to shelve the fileds are dug out deeply below the level of the public paths, for direct irri gation ; the outlying palms, beyond the level of the springs, are watered from well-pits dug to a depth of 27 feet. The ground-watfer, which is cooler and brackish, is drawn bv small humped cattle. J Al-Ali' is a great source of date-supply for the north-west nomads, and there is a certain amount of traffic in corn and imported rice. If the many kinds of dates, the hilu variety is chiefly exported to Syria. There are groves of sweet ahd sour lemons, but the plum is the only stone-fruit. There are not many vines, and these climb on trees and trellises. Besides the humped cattle employed for field labour, there are a few asses and goats and some poultry. Four or five miles northward of Al 'Ali are some little ancient wells of three fathoms called Al-Athaib, with bad water. Not far south of these wells begins the Buehaz-al- , ^jj^ etWee - n . t ^ e sanc | stone cliffs, Mu'allaq-al-Hamaidi, of the hurrah, and the high ruddy precipices of that wild barrier of low mountains which closes the plain of Madain Salih to the southward, Al-Huthabah, Jabal Rumm, and Muwatadil. Under the eastern side of this defile is seen a wide bank of stone heaps mingled with loam, evidently the ruin of a town of stone houses. The Arabs call this site Al-Kharaibi and in the midst of it is a famous stone cistern. Al-'Ali was also known as Baith Na'am, Sha'ab-an-Na'am, and as Bandar 'Aulaushv Alushy, or 'Doughty. ^ 'ALI (Al or Ahl)— An Arab tribe of Trucial'Oman and the Shibkuh district in Persia : they belong to the Ghafiri faction and are described as Hanbali Sunnis in religion, but are virtually Wahhabis. The bulk of the tribe are now settled in towns,—1,000 families residing at Umm-al-Qaiwain, 200 at Sharjah and 150 at Ras-al-Khaimah. The Bed- oum portion of the tribe m Trucial 'Oman number about 140 families and frequent the country from Umm-al-Qaiwain to JazIrat-al-Hamrah and as far inland as Falaj Al 'Ali. J.ne Al An of the Persian side are separately described in the article on Shibkuh; by150 ALI—ALI them the Al 'Ali of Trucial 'Oman are regarded as forming a division called Bin Mu'alla. The Al Ali generally claim connection with the Mutair of Najd, and by some authorities the Bani Bu 'Ali of the 'Oman Sultanate are considered to be of one stock with the Al 'Ali. 'ALI (A l)— A family of the Ma'adhld {q.v.) ; they deny relationship with the Al Bin 'All. 'ALI (A l B in)— One of the largest Arab tribes in Bahrain and fairly numerous also in Qatar. In Bahrain they are found at Muharraq Town (400 houses) and at Hadd (100 houses); in Qatar, exclusive of some of the Ma'adhid section, they number 350 households at Dohah Below follow the principal sections and sub-sections, according to the best information obtainable, of the Al Bin-'Ali; but it is not certain that all the divisions specified originally belonged to the tribe, and there is even reason to think that some of them are se parate tribes which have undergone affiliation.

The list of Ma'adhid families given above is not exhaustive. Some of the Al Bu, Shadhaib are said to live with the Manasir in Trucial 'Oman ; and one of the Al Bin- Burbas family of the Al Bu Shadhaib is reported to have succeeded, on the ground of affinity by marriage, to a tribal Shaikhship left vacant by the extinction of the Al Sala- mah family of the Ma'adhid. All the sections and sub-sections of the Al Bin-'Ali are so much intermarried and such stress is at the same time laid on female descent that a majority of the tribe now describe themselves indifferently as belonging to one division or another, and that there is considerable doubt even among tribesmen as to which divisions include, and which are included in, others. The number of the Al Bin-'Ali, ; apart from the Ma'adhid families who disclaim connection with the tribe, is probably about 4,500 souls. These Ma'adhid families alone excepted, the Al Bin-'Ali fly on their boats a distinctive flag of 5 red and 5 white stripes alternating ; it is called the Salaimi flag, and the bulk of the tribe for this reason are known also by the alternative name of Al Salaim. By profession the Al Bin-'Ali are pearl divers, pearl merchants, cultivators of dates, and sailors voyaging to all parts of the Persian Gulf and even to places beyond; none of the tribe are j)astoral. In religion they are Maliki Sunnis. The Al Bin-'Ali are variously derived by different authorities from the 'Anizah, Qahtan, and Bani Tamlm, all Arab tribes of Najd; the truth, perhaps, is that they are | of mixed origin. The greater number of the Al Bin-'Ali of Bahrain arrived in 1783 with the 'Utub and have ever since been closely connected with that tribe, but in a sub ordinate capacity. A considerable number of them again emigrated to Qatar in 1894 to escape the tyranny of the Shaikh of Bahrain. There is at the present time a serious feud, arising out of bloodshed, between the Al Bin-'Ali and the 'Amamarah. 'ALT ( A l B in)—- A ward or quarter of Muharraq Town {q. v.) 'ALT (A l B u)— One of the two sub sections of the Ishkarah section of the Dawasir {q. v.) tribe ; See under^the 'Ammar sub-division of the Al Hasan. 'ALI-AL-GHARBI— A small town in 'Iraq on the right bank of the Tigris about half-way by river between 'Amarah and Kut. There are about 300 brick houses and a population of perhaps 2,000 souls. The inhabitants are of mixed origin, but almost entirely Shi'ahs by religion ; they live by agriculture and petty trade. Wheat and barley grown in the surrounding country are exported; also ghi, wool, skins and other Kurdish products, for 'Al-al Gharbi is a depot of the Kurdistan trade, besides being a market town of the Bani Lam tribe. A small business in Manchester goods is carried on, chiefly on Jewish merchants who barter them for grain. Under Turkish rule, 'Ali-al-Gharbi was the headquarters of a Nahiyah of the same name in the Qadha of 'Amarah and consequently the seat of a Mudir; it has also a telegraph office and two Khans. The town takes its name from a mosque dedicated, it is said, to 'Ali, a son of the Imam Musa whose tome is at Kadhimain. The name of 'Ali-ash-Sharqi, a place on the left or eastern bank of the Tigris about three servants of the way from 'Ali-al-Gharbi to 'Amarah has a similar derivation; it also is the headquarters of a Mudirate in the 'Amarah Qadha and exports some grain, but it is much smaller than 'Ali-al-Gharbi, in fact there is only a shrine and a few tents.* There is a forest at 'Ali-ash-Sharqi, which was formerly reserved by the Turkish Govern ment. Topography.—Between 'Ali-al-Gharbi and Shaikh Sa'ad the ground on both sides of the river at the end of August is dry and hard to six miles inland. Between 'Ali-al-Gharbi and 'Ali-ash-Sharqi, on the right bank, are a number of creeks which would form an obstacle to an advance. The following were noted at the end of June, 1915, as being the principal:— (a) A small creek, 10 yards wide and 3 feet deep, fordable, with good banks and a hard bottom, about 5 miles above 'Ali-ash-Sharqi.(b) Gurmat Saiyid 'Ali creek ; one mile below Al-'Atah ; 19 yards wide and 9 feet deep, with quickly-shelving banks at a point 100 yards from its mouth. At the mouth, however, it is onlly 4 feet 6 inches deep and 40 yards wide, with hard banks and bottom, stream 2m.p.h. The Arabs cross it at this point. There is also a small irrigation cut 20 yards from this creek which is every where fordable 4 (c) A small cut one mile above Al-'Atah and called Almah, 10 yards wide with hard banks and bottom ; fordable. The Saiyidiyah creek, four miles above Al-'Atah, 66 yards wide and 14 feet deep in the center, stream 2 m.p.h. Seven feet deep for 20 yards on south bank, and shelving to 7 feet deep for 12 yards on north bank, after which it deepens rapidly to 14 feet. Good banks and bottom. (e) Fahadiyah creek, One mile below Filaifilah, caused by the river breaking the bank at a sharp bend. This creek is 95 yards wide and very deep ; the banks shelve rapidly on the south side and to* 7 feet in. 12 yards on the north bank. Streams 2 m.p.h. (/) A small irrigation cut beside the Fahadiyah creek 10 yards wide and 4 feet 6 inches deep. mih There are no more obstacles to an advance on the right bank between Filaifilah and 'Ali-al-Gharbi. On the left bank there is only one creek which forms an obstacle to an advance. This is the Husain creek, about 13 milea below 'Ali-al Gharbi and 5 miles above Filaifilah. This creek is caused by the river breaking the bank at a sharp bend. It is 25 yards wide and from 6 to 8 feet deep, with good banks and bottom,' Stream 2 m.p.h. Communications* —According to a native report a road runs from 'Ali-al-Gharbi across the Persian frontier to Ibrahim Kotal and another to Tumtumeh, also in Persia. Both are steep in places, but are passable for horses and camels. |^j Routes also run to 'Amarah via the left bank of the Tigris, the distance being about 62 miles, and to Baksai (Bagh-i-Shahi) on the Persian frontier, 35| miles. From 'Ali-al- Gharbi to Kuwait (on the Tib river) is 26 miles, easy going ; and to Pai-Takht, 28 miles. A Russian Cosack patrol of 110 men travelled from Maidasht, near Kirmanshah to 'Ali-al-Gharbi in May, 1916. They marched via Changulak, the total distance covered being rather over 180 miles. The distances to Hai and to Qal'at Sikar are 44 and 65 miles respectively. 'ALI-ASH-SHARQI— See 'Ali-al-Gharbi. 'ALI (Aulad)— One of the main sub-divisions of the Braih division of the Bani Mutair {q.v.)

The Bani Bu 'Ali became Wahhabis at the time of the Najdi invasions of 'Oman nearly a century ago ; and as late as 1845 they were strict, if not fanatical, in the observance of Wahhabi principles. They have since relaxed something of their rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco ; but they continue to be exact in their observance of the forms and times of prayer and are accounted the most religious tribe in the 'Oman Sultanate. They belong to a Wahhabi sect known as Azraqah. The Bani Bu Ali are on the average men of middle size, with short features and quick deep-set eyes. A gloomy and determined expression which characterises some of them does not belie their natural character. They are a warlike, independent race and bear a h gh reputation' for courage and dash. Their favourite weapon was originally a thin, straight, two-edged sword, sharp as a razor and attached by a leather thong to a shield 14 incnes in diameter, in addition to which they carried matchlocks ; their ar mament is now of a more modern character, but they still have few breech-loaders. The Bani Ba Ali are the only tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate that have met a British force on land. On the 9th November of 1820, they defeate 1 a force of British Indian sepoys at their village of Balad Bani Bu'Ali, and on the 2nd March 1821 suffered severe retribution near the same place. On the latter occasion the tribe lost heavily is killed and wounded, the town and fort were destroyed and a large number of prisoners were taken including the principal Shaikh, Muhammad-bin- 'Ali; but the date groves belonging to the place were spared,—an act of clemency that was much appreciated and is still remembered. The prisoners after being kept for two years at Bombay were repatriated and received grants of money from the Indian Government to enable them to rebuilt their houses and restore irrigation. Since this episode the tribe have uniformly shown themselves well-disposed to the British nation and have treated hospitably more than one British traveller visiting their country; but they have never fully regained their position in tribal politics. The Bani Bu 'Ali have a chronic feud with their neighbours the Bani Ba Hasan; their present Tamimah resides near Lashkharah but sometimes visits Sir, where he has a house.

They narrow the navigable channel down to GJ miles. These reefs extend nearly 9 miles in south-south easterly direction from their northern end, and do not uncover at low water, with the exception of the small Shag Rock at the southern end, which is 3 feet hi^h and miles from the above ligh house. In shore of Shab 'Ali there is a good channel, useful to steam-vessels of small power; it is nearly 9 miles long and 1J mile s wide at its narrowest part, where Shab Itiguyig, an extension of the shore reef, stretches off towards it more than 3J miles, and connects with it by a narrow neck or bar, with depths of 8 to 9 fathoms. At either end of the channel it is deeper, from 15 to 20 fathoms being about the average. The channel may be safely used during the day; about a north- north-west course leads through it, but a good look-out must be kept for detached rocks, especially near the northern entrance, where the Azov Patch lies well out in the channel; and, again in steaming out into the straits, the Poynder Shoal of 3 fathoms must be carefully avoided.— {Bed Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot, 1909,) 'ALI SHIR— A creek, with some habitations, in Fao, {q. v.).

In the valleys themselves there is very little slope; and most of the valley heads wii:h the exception of that of Wadi Adlm are of nearlv uniform height with the main valley. There sides are walls of rock nearly 1 000 feet high, and eaten away as it were out of the plateau. The Wadi bin'Aii is the main ap proach to the 'Aqabah for travellers between Shibam and Shihr.

Site and buildings. —'Amarah stands on a strip of land enclosed on the west by the Tigris and on the north and east by the Jahilah canal; while to the south of it, but at some distance, are the marshes of the Al Bii Muhammad tribe. To the east of the Jahalah are extensive swamps and waterways, by means of which some boat communi cation is maintained with the Hawizeh District and with Persian 'Arabistan as a whole. On the right bank of the Tigris opposite 'Amarah are flourishing plantations of dates^ other fruit trees and poplars, amidst which is the village or suburb of Daffas,—so called from a^iirine which it contains,—united to the town of 'Amarah by a. boat bridge for merly of about 40 pontoons, but now reduced to about hr.lf that number by the employ ment of larger boats. 'Amarah has a river frontage of more than half a mile upon the Tigris; and a good embankment or wharf faced with brick, alongside of which steamer can lie, runs the wnole length of the town. The northern quarter is the older and extends the whole way from the Tigris to the Jahalah, which is spanned behind the town by a boat bridge of several pontoons. In the northern quarter is situated a fine building which used to belong to the Dairat-as-Sanlyah ; here also are the military barracks and, upon the quay, the principal government offices. The main street of the town traverses the northern quarter from the Tigris to the Jahalah running at right angles to both streams : it contains the chief bazaar, of which the end next the Tigris was destroyed by fire in 1903 and has now been rebuilt in a more modern and commodious style. The southern quarter consists of a row of 27 new houses of uniform pattern and handsome appearance which face the river and form 6 large blocks': 15 of them were built as a speculation by the Dairat-as-SanTyah and the remainder by local Shaikhs in emulation of the Department's example. There are at 'Amarah two public baths. Inhabitants.

Products, manufactures and trade. —The gardens of the town produce citrons, pome granates, quinces, figs and graves. Arab cloaks, Kurdish rugs and silver ware are among the manufactures of the place ; the silverware is the work of the Sabians and one variety of it, inlaid with antimonv, is unusual and not inelegant. . wool, hides and skins, various kinds of nuts, also walnut and other woods are imported from the Kurdish hills, while wheat, barley, maize, rice and sesame are brought ^ tr ™ ! he surroun ding country. The imports of 'Amarah from foreign contries are Od2(W)GSB162 AMA—AMD the same as those of 'Iraq generally. Live cattle are exported by land in great numbers from 'Amarah to Syria. 'Amarah supplies Baghdad and Basrah with ghi, rice and barley ; a considerable quantity of the barley ia shipped to Europe and the greater part of the ghi to Bombay and the Levant ports. 'Amtoh wool, which is of excellent quality, is for the most part baled in a press belonging to Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and goes chiefly to London and Marseilles. In matters of trade 'Amarah is dependent to a great extent upon Baghdad through which it receives nearly all its imports from abroad. Skins and hides are usually sent to Baghdad to be pressed for exportation : there are, however, two native hand-presses for hides. The currency of 'Amarah consists chiefly of Persian silver Qrans. Shops were said to number 150. Administrative and official matters. Under Turkish rule, 'Amarah was a place of administrative importance, being the headquarters of the Sanjaq of 'Amarah and the residence of the Mutasarrif: it had ordinarily a military garrison amounting to one infantry battalion, one squadron of cavalry and three or four fields guns. The Dairat-as-Sanlyah had a head office here ; and the Customs, Public Debt and Sanitary Departments and the Tobacco Regie were each represented by a Mamur, white a harbour master superintended shipping and river conservancy. There is a telegrapti office linked with 'Ali-al-Gharbi on one side and Qal'at Sahh on the other, ihe Persian Government were represented at 'Amarah by a Naib-Karpardaz or Consular Agent.

It is believed to mark the site of a battle field on Which a Turkish commander broke the power of the local Arabs and afterwards en camped, and for this reason it is still sometimes called Ordu or The Camp. 5 AMARAH (U mm-al)— A depressed tract in Dibdibah {q-v.)* 5 amar A t— A section of the 'Anaizah tribe {q. v.)* 'AMARIYAH— One of the sections of the Hinawi tribe of Bani Hasan in the 'Om&amp;i Sultanate (?. v.), 3 AMARJlD— A section of the Mahra tribe {q. v.) of southern Arabia, AMAYAH(Al)— ( ^ 4 , , One of the numerous marsh villages in theQurnah district of Mesopotamia.

Communications. —'Anah is an important halting place on the caravan route between Baghdad and Aleppo. There is a desert route running across the desert to Mosul. By river 'Anah is 199 miles above Fallujah and 373 miles below Meskeneh, the river-station for Aleppo. There are many islands in the stream above 'Anah. One Of them, Karabilah, is reported to have ruins upon it; it lies about 4 hours' journey from ancient 'Anah. Rawah is a small town on the left bank of the Euphrates immediately above 'Anah. Another island, below modern 'Anah, is Lubbad where there is a village and a ruined fortress.

From among the houses springs a tall and beautiful minaret. This island was eonnected to both banks by bridges.—(ifiss Bell)—{0. T. November 1910.) 'ANAIBAR (jazirat)— An island of the west coast of Qatar [q. it .). 'ANAIJ (Ramlat)— A narrow strip of rolling sand hills in Trucial 'Oman [q. v.). 'ANAIZAH— The - principal town of Qasim and in fact of all Najd, it is situated about 150 miles south-east by east of Hail] 200 miles north-west of Riyadh and 12 miles south of Buraidah. It is thus about half way between Basrah and Mecca, being distant about 400 miles from either, and' lies nearly in the straight line, and not far from- mid way, between the capitals of Northern and Southern Najd. With- good reason it is regarded by its inhabitants as being the centre of the whole Arabian peninsula and is stayied by them Umm Najd or 'Mother of Central Arabia.' Site and buildings. —The site of 'Anaizah is a loamy hollow 2 or 3 miles from the right bank of Wadi-ar-Rummah, underlain by sandstone rook and surrounded by sandy desert. TO the south-east, at no great distance, are some very barren hills covered with loose stones. The height of 'Anaizah above the sea is probably about 2,500 feet. The town is walled and stands in-the middle of an oasis whiclvis also walled, or formerly was so ; the space between the outer and the inner enceinte is filled with' date groves, gardens and cultivated fields. On* the north of the town this cultivated belt has a depth of 1 to 2 miles, and the aspect which the place presents to a traveller approaching from this side is imposing in its extent as well as in its richness. Both walls are of unbanked brick work and are strengthened bytowers set at intevals. The outer well being very thick. The agricultural resources and abundant supply of well-water which the oasis- contains would render its reduction by blockade a difficult if not impossible task. Internally the town is divided into three principal wards, each of which has its own separate banner in time of war ; they are Kharaizah on the north and west, Hofiif on the south, and Umm Himar on the east. The houses, even the best, are clay-built, but pleasant and clean : a large proportion of them have upper storeys. Population. —The inhabitants of 'Anaizah are mostly of the Bani Tamim tribe ; but the town is said to have been founded by Sabi from' Aridh, to whom Bani Khalid refuges were added at a later date. There are also some 'Anizah. The total population is reported at the present time (1917) to bo some what less than that of Buraidah. and probably does not much exceed 10,000 souls. The people have a free bearing and are well clad ; they are industrious and not unintelligent, but their disposition has been some what soured by the Wahhabi form of religious-, which is still in the ascendant, though not universal, among them. The poorer townsmen resemble Bedouins in garb, and wear the Kafiyah and ' Aqal of the desert; while the richer classes use the fez, over which gray-coloured kerchief is loosely thrown. The well-to-do dress in light worsted 'Abas from 'Iraq, with sometimes an embroidered, collar ;: and persons of good birth, when C52 (w )CnSB z170 'ANAIZAH walking in the street, carry in their hands long rods that are brought from Mecca. The women are not visible in the day time, but go out to visit at one another's houses between twilight and the last prayer Friday is the market day, and the Friday prayers in the congregational mosque are attended by all and sundry residing in the oasis. More aged men are to be seen here than in north-western Arabia generally. The prin cipal disease are fever, enlarged spleen, catarrh, and cataract. In 1880 the mosques of 'Anaizah numbered 15, including the Jami' in the public square ; and there were four schools, of which one was for girls. The residents of the town have an agreeable cus tom of camping en famille in the surrounding desert for change of air. Agriculture. —'Anaizah, though it possesses a considerable trade, is largely dependent on its agriculture. On the town lands wheat is grown year after year in the same fields, and the crops are dense but light; fresh loan and the dung of the camels which work the water-lifts are the only manures in use. The fields are levelled, embanked, and irrigated from wells ; the date trees stand in channels which are flushed with water twice daily. The ordinary cereals' fruits and vegetables of Qasim are cultivated. Most of the small owners are burdened with debt and cannot afford sufficiently to irrigat® their ground. Animals are horses, camels, donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats, the horse are estimated at 60, the came«s at 1,000, the donkeys at 300 and the horned cattle at 1,500. Internal trade and Supplies of many kinds are abundant. In the main bazaar are sold piece-goods, clothing, drugs (including occasionally English medicines guch as cod liver oil), camel medicines, loaf sugar, spices Syrian soap imported through al-Madlnah, and Yemen coffee brought by caravans from Mecca. This principal bazaar is called Masqaf; it contains about 120 shops, but only a small part of it is roofed over. Most of the imported commodities are received through Kuwait; the remainder come through Hasa or, as already mentioned, from Mecca or al-Madinah. In the outlying quarters of the town are small shops which deal in sundries, such as iron, nails, matches, salt, onions, eggs, girdle-bread and milk ; and on Fridays veiled women sell chickens in the market place and dispose of skins for holding milk or water which they have tanned and prepared with their own hands. Common food, Arabian coffee and clothing from the Persian Gulf side are cheap; and dates, sold by weight sometimes at 30 lbs. for a dollar are excellent; but grain is dear. There is only one well of perfectly fresh water, and it is observed that the wells near the desert yield as a rule sweeter water than those lower down in Qa' or basin in which the town stands. Occupations and industries. —Numerous handicrafts and industries are exercised in 'Anaizah : there are goldsmiths, silversmiths, armourers and tinkers ; turners of wooden bowls and makers of wooden locks, of camel-saddles and of wheels for wells ; stone cutters, who seldom live more than three or four years at their trade on account of its unheal thine ss; sinkers and liners of wells, workers in marble and manufactures of coffee-mortars ; house buildings and plasterers ; seamsters and seamstresses ; embroi derers and sandal makers. The goldsmiths and silversmiths of 'Anaizah are renowned for their filigree and thread work, and some who have settled at Makkah are said to surpass all their competitors there. External trade. —Trade on the large scale is represented by about 15 merchants of substances some of whom have representatives at Basrah and Jiddah 5 the capital of the wealthiest among them may be worth £24,000. Among the leading merchants are a family named Bassam who are said to be of Washam origin. There is no horse-breed ing at 'Anaizah itself, but horses are purchased from the Bedouins in winter and brought into condition for export to India. Ghi also is collected from the Bedouins in spring by 'Anaizah merchants and stored in marble troughs till summer or autumn, when it is sent by caravan to Makka; one such caravan may carry as much as 30 tons of ghi worth, £2,000. Political position and administration. —The history of 'Anaizah is that of Qasim, in which it has ever occupied the leading position. Before the capture of the place by the Amir of Jabal Shammar in 1891, 'Anaizah was ruled by its own Amirs ; they possessed arbitrary powers, but wielded them in a constitutional manner, deferring to some extent to their Majlis or council. Capital punishment was then but rarely inflict ted. Common offences and theft were visited with a beating ; cutting off of the hand for theft, according to Muhammadan law, was not in vogue. Hardened felons wereANA—ANA 171 expelled from the township. In case of a military expedition the lists for service were made up by the Amir, only the better-off classes being required to service ; those who were called out were obliged to send a camel and back-rider each, the front place on the animal being filled either by the sender or, if he preferred it, by an efficient substitute^ The poorer classes remained at home for the defence of the town, and on such occasions it was customary to discontinue the morning market, to prohibit the killing of butchers' meat, and to close by order all places of business except small general shops. A typical expedition sent out by the town in 1878 against Bedouins consisted of 400 men with 20 mares and 200 camels. It is probable that, after the liberation of Qasim from the yoke of Jabal Shammar in 1902, the old order of things was in most respects re-established under the present Amir, 'Abdul 'Aziz-bin-'Abdullah-bin-Yahya ; nor does it appears that it has been seriously modified since the nominal Turkish occupation of Qasim in 1905. The sole sign of Turkish influence in 1906 was a Nuqtah or military post garrisoned by a detach ment of less than 100 Turkish oldiers under a Yuzbashi; this detachment occupied a house belonging to the Amir of 'Anaizah in the Umm Himar quarter, it seemed to have no police or other duties in the town, and according to the accounts received its pre sence was virtually ignored by the Arabs. The Amir held the honorary rank of MudTr, but he drew no salary and maintained no relations with the Turks. He was understood to profess allegiance to Ibn Sa'ud alone and to pay him occasional tribes. 'ANAJID— A section of the Shaul tribe {q. v.) of southern Najd.

'ANAZAH (Tribe)— Singular 'Anizi; there is also a plural 'Aniiz a great Arab tribe of Northern and Central Arabia, descended from the Qahtan.* Distribution, —Their original seat is believed to have been a little to the north of Madinah on the water-shed between the Red sea and the basin of Wadi-ar-Rummah, but the Dlrah of their Bedouins now extends from Q^slm and Madinah on the south to the • Palgrave. Doughty however (I. 331) treats the 'Amarat as a sub-division of the Bishr and does not mention the Dahamishah and Hilban worn our Kuwait authority treats as important. NOTE.—Doughty mentions the following additional fendies Bdur, Bduz, Bejaija, Belais, Deraan, Dogman, and Farujia. C, C, i?. M* z2.If2 'ANAZAH JIauran in Syria on the north, while on the east it reaches to the main route between JSail and Najaf and, further north, to the Euphrates valley. Some of the Bedouin 'Anizah occupy the neighbourhood of Musaiyib in 'Iraq for about two months in 4;he year, and make their annual purchases of .food and clothing there and at Aawairij. The greater part of the Syrian desert belongs to the 'Anizah, and they come in contact with •the Persian Gulf basin chiefly to the west of the Euphrates between Karbala and Najaf and further south on the borders of Jabal Shammar, where they camp in Hajarah and dis pute the possession of Batn with the Shammar tribe. The frequent Wadyan and the Nafud ; in the latter Jubbah is one of their chief centres. The Bedouins around Taimah are 'Anizah, and numbers of the tribe collect during the date harvest at Khaibar, which •formerly belonged to them and where they still own plantations. Besides these Bedouins a very considerable proportion of the sedentary population in the districts of Southern Najd and in Qasim appear to be of 'Anizah blood. Divisions and numbers of the Bedouin 'AnizaJi.—Ths internal organisation of the Ainzah tribe is a subject of great difficulty, and comparison of the various authorities who have written on the subject yields no clear or consistent result. According to information collected recently at Kuwait, the more southern 'Anizah ■all into two main divisions, Ihe 'Amarat and the Bishr. The Amarat are sub-divided into Dahamishah and Hiban, and these again into the sections and sub-section below:— Dahdmishah sub-division of the J Amarat. { Adalat 'Ayash Dhuwaidah Sumair Suwalim Tawatihah Dahdmishah sub-section of the ^ Amardt —contd.

The pasture of their Dirah is excellent, but thei good watering-places are few and their wells are deep. In persons the Bishr are robust and resemble the Bedouins of the north ; for dress they wear clothe imported from 'Iraq and sometimes done as head-gear a worsted band wound fold upon fold like a^turban. The Suba'ah sub-division of the Bishr are said to be found chiefly in the direction of Najaf and Karbala ; on the average they are short of stature but carry long spears. Batn is on the border between them and the Shammar. The Wald Sulaiman* sub-division of the Bishr is said by some to include, as well as the section given above, the Bajaidah, a portion of the 'Anizah tribe of whom a good deal is heard. It seems certain that the Fuqarah section of the Wald Salaiman together with a number of rather strong sections collectively known as the Wald'Alif compose a group known as the Bani WahabJ but whether this group includes other section of the Wald Sulaiman besides the Fuqrah cannot, on present data, be determined. The 'Awajiyahs section of the Wald Salaiman are described as inhospitatable and violent in their dealings; they are found between the Nafud and Qasim. The Fuqrah§ section of the Wald Sulai man, in number about 800 souls, inhabit the country between Taimah and Khaibar and extend to the west of the pilgrim-route from Syria to Madinah. They live generally in the Bedouin manner, but their Shaikhs have houses at Khaibar, where the tribesmen sell querns of their own manufacture at the autumn fair. In religion the Fuqrah are some what fanatical; yet they eat the hedgehog and the fox, and their women go unveiled. In 1878 they were subject to Ibn Rashld, to whom they paid tribute of §400 a year at the rate of one dollar per 5 camels or 30 head of cattle. They were then on bad terms with the Muwahib another section of the 'Anizah who are variously described as belonging to the Hilban and to the Saba'ha. The 'Amarat and the Bishr, except the Saha'ah, mainly belong to the south; the best known ' Anizah of the north are the Ruwalah, the Qalas or Jalas and the Sha'alan A close connection exists between these three, but it has not been satisfactorily explained. The Ruwalah are certainly a large body ; their range is from the Nafud northwards to the Syrian Hauran and from Wadi Sirhan on the west to the Hail Najaf route on the east. The Ruwalah, it is said, can ordinarily be distinguished from their southern neighbours the Shammar by their smaller horses and shorter spears. Portion of the 'Anizah tribe who cannot, on the information available be correlated with any of the foregoing are the— 'Ajail. Makasiraj. Alaidah*. Musai'b. Daghaiyim. (Al). Matutah. Dahman. Muwaijah. Dhayan (Bani). Nuri. Dilimah. Rus. Hasani, Shiblanf or Shimlan. Idhn. Shumailah Jala'id. Taiyar. Probably a number of these are fractions of the larger and smaller units already enumera ted. The total strength of the Bedouin 'Anizah may, on various consideration, be roughly estimated at 36,000$ souls. * Fida'an encampments are to be found in the neighbourhood of Bir Malusi and Wadi Hauran.—( Leachman 1910-12). * It may be noted here that there is little or no agreement between Guarmani's division of the Wald Sulaiman and that furnishe by our authority. t Regarding the Wald 'Ali there is considerable agreement between Doughty and Huber. The largest section 2.of the Wald 'Ali appears to be the Tuwalah and the most aristocratic the Alaidah. t By some accounts the Bani Wahab include also all the Bishr, Ruwalah and Qlaas : see Doughty, I 229. § Doughty divides the Fuqarah into 8 sub-sections, Huber into 9 ; only 3 names in the two lists appears to correspond—an apt illustration of the difficulty of tribal questions in Arabia. It is not clear that our Kuwait authority, in classing the Fuqarah as Bishr, has Dough ty's support. * Possibly a section of the Wald 'Ali group. See second footnote, page 85. t The Shiblan are said to include the Naif who appear to be identical with a dan mentioned by Willin as belonging to the north. On the other hand, Guarmani appears to include the Shimlan with the Wald Sulaiman of the south-west. t This estimate is partially based on Kuwait reports of the fighting strength of the southern 'Anizah, which though containing useful indication^ were not sufficiently reliable to be included in the article. Doughtv placed the total of the tribe at 25,000 souls only ; the present shaikh of Kuwait on the other hand would raise th&lt;3 Ameah to a frankly impossible figure.174 'ANAZAH Character and life of the Bedouin 'Anizah. —The 'Anizah are respected by their neigh bours and enemies the Shammar as being, next to themselves the noblest ofthe Bedouins in descent and character; nevertheless the more suthern 'Anizah are perhaps the most evilly disposed tribe, except the Qahtan, of Central Arabia. The features of The northern 'Anizah are often of a Syrian or even Jewis caste. Some 'Anizah families, for the sake of a more comfortable life, live among the Hataim ; but they do not intermarry with them. The tents of the 'Anirzah are high compared with others, and the apartment of the wife is upon the left in entering. Political sympathies. —In the recent struggle in Central Arabia the Bedouins, at least of the 'Anizah took part with Ibn Sa'ud and the Shaikh of Kuwait against Ibn Rashid. Settled 'Anizah. —The foregoing remarks relate to the Bedouin 'Anizah ; but, as already observed, a large part of the settled population of Najd claim to be, and many of them probably are, of the 'Anizah. In Jabal Shammar they are not mentioned ex cept at elauf-al'Amir and Ghazalah ; but in Qasim settled Arabs who call themselves 'Anizah are apparently found at 'Anizah, Buraidah, Dhalfa'ah Dharas, 'Ain-ibn-Fahaid Ghaf I, Khabrah, Khadhar, Qusaibah, Muraid Saiyid. Rass, Raudhat-ar-Rubai'i Saib, Shaihiyah, Shiqqah, Ta'amiyah, Watit and Wathal, and possibly at Khabb, Mudhnib and Qisaiya'ah. In Sadair they are said to occur at Dakhilah, Dhalmah, Harmah, Ijwai, Janubiyah, Khis, Majma', Ruwaidah, Tuwaim and Zilfi ; in 'Aridh at Barrah, Haraimlah and Malham in Mahmal, at Batfn-ash-Shuyukh, Manfuhah and Riyadh on Wadi Hanifah, and at Dhrumah town, Mizamiyah and R5dhah in the Dhrumah tract. In Hariq their presence is reported at Hariq town and Mufaijir, and in Hautah at Hautah town and Hilwah. In Aflaj they are found at Raudhah and in Wadi Sabai' at Khurmah and Raudhah. They also occur in Kharj. The sections to which the setteld 'Anizah belong have not been investigated in many cases, but the following are mentioned :— 'Askar in Kharj and at Dhalmah and Majma' Hawaishan in Zilfi. in Sadair. Hazazina at Hariq town and Mufaijir in Hariq. Daud at Hautah town in Hautah If qahah at the town of Dhrumah. Harqan at Malham in Aridh Ijdaimat at Raudhah in Aflaj. Hawaidi at Majma'; in Sadair. Raba (Al Bu) at Dakhilah in Sadair. Of these the Hazazinah are said to be a branch of the Ruwalah, already mentioned in the paragraph on Bedouin divisions. Among the settled 'Anizah mention must also be made of the Misalikh. According to some authorities these are a branch of the Waid 'Ali; and the Al Maqran the family of the rulers of Southern Najd together with the family of the Shaikhs of Buraidh in Qasim are said to be sprung from them. Another authority describes this tribe as follows:— The great group of the 'Anazah, numerically probably the largest group of nomad Arab tribes, occupies the triangle of the Syrian Desert, the Hamad, which has its base on the Nafud, about lat. 30°, and its apex near Aleppo, about lat. 36°. On the east bank of the Euphrates the pasture lands north of Der-ez-Zor and tilong the Khabur are also 'Anazah country ; while a smaller group of kindred tribe is seated round Taima, between the Hejaz railway and the south-west borders of the Nafud. Ibn Sa'ud is laid to come of the same stock (Hazainah). The 'Anazah belong to the people of the North, Ahl-ash-Shamal. Historians give their descent from 'Anazah, son of Asad, who' sprang from Rabi'a, one of the two great branches of Nizar. The modern 'Anazah tribesman will aways claim descent from Wail, who bleonged to a younger branch of the Asad group, and relate that it is his son 'Anz or 'Anauz^ who is the eponymous founder of the tribe. They are not, however, united under one head, but are divided into several large sections which maintain towards one anoher an attitude generally friendly, though it does not exclude marauding expeditions and private feuds among the smaller Shaikhs. There hereditary foes of the 'Anazah are the Shammar ; indeed the history of i\omad Arabia is dominated for the last 150 years by the rivalry between these two. The original seat of the Shammar seems to have been to the north of the Wadi Rummah, on the pilgrim road from Basrah to Al-Madinah, or even farther south towards Yemen. One of those mysterious impulses which, from the beginning of histori c'ANAZAH 175 times, have set the inhabitants of the peninsula migrating northwards—influences which may spring from an almost imperceptible change in climatic conditions coupled with slow increase of population in a land incapable of supporting more than very small numbers—began to disturb the 'Anazah in the second half of the eighteenth century. They followed on the heels of the Shammar into the Syrian Desert. The Fida'an and the Hasainah pushed the Shammar before them across the Euphrates, and established themselves in the northern steppes, which are less arid, enjoying a greater rcinfall, than the wastes of central Arabia. The 'Amarat, Saba'ah, and Wulud 'Ali seem to have come next, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the Ruwalah. Their herds have flourished and increased in a climate more beneficent than that which they had left. The most famous stocks of horses are found among the northern 'Anazah, and the greatest numbers of camels. Bedu of the purest blood and tradition, they have remained entirely beyond the control of the Ottoman Govrernment and except for a few palm-gardens on the Lower Euphrates, a little cultivation on the Khabur and a village near Damascus, their Shaikhs have given no pledge to established order by the acquisition of settled lands, nor is any part of the Syrian Desert ploughed or harvested. Their geographical position gives them command over some of the main trade-routes of Turkish Arabia. The Hamad is a bridge rather than a barrier between Syria and Mesopotamia, Until 1911 the camel post from Damascus to Baghdad passed over it once a fortnight, and regularly during the winter and spring the agents of the Damascene sheep merchants cross it, paying dues to the 'Anazah for safe-conduct, while the camel herds of the latter supply the markets both of Syria and of Egypt; indeed, it is not too much to say that the greater part of the camel trade is their hands. Moreover, the road down the Euphrates from Aleppo to Baghdad is largely at their mercy, as well as the first half of a frequented carriage road from Dair, via the Sin jar, to Mosul. The 'Anazah are thus the first of the great independent tribes with whom admnistrators of the settled lands must come into contact, and upon their goodwill depends freedom of intercourse between Syria and Mesopotamia. Last century they played a large part in Syrian politics, and have still a zest for the game. Their own dependence on the Syrian markets must always make it a matter of the first importance to them to maintain friendly terms with those who control the province commercially ; but it must be remembered that commercial control of Syria is not, and never has been, in the hands of the Turks. The western side of the Syrian Desert is occupied by the Ruwalah. With their powerful confederates the Wulud 'Ali and the Muhallaf, who are in the closest relations with them, and also their allies, the Hasainah, they number about 7,000 tents. They wander over the desert from Homs and Hamah in the north, where the Hasainah have their summer pasturages and are beginning to settle down as cultivators, to Qasr-el- Azraq, south of Jabal Druz (where the Ruwalla dira touches that of their foes, the Bani Sakhr) and down the Wadi Sirhan to the oasis of Jauf-al-'Umr, which the Ruwalah took from Ibn Rashid in 1910. In summer they occupy the pasture grounds south of Damascus and push as far west as the Jaulan. To the east the limits of the Ruwalah extend to Al-Wadyan and even as far as Bir Hazil. The Ruwalah are well armed an are probably the strongest tribe in Arabia. They are at enmity with the 'Amarat division of the 'Anazah, though they some times unite and make common cause against Ibn Rashid. The chief Ruwalah Shaikh, Nuri Ibn Sha'lan, was imprisoned in Damascus by the Turks for a short time, but towards the end of 1912 was released. The loose confederation of tribes, of which the Wulud 'Ali are composed, holds the steppe east and south-east of Damascus and along the first part of the old post-road to Baghdad. Ibn Smair owns the village of 'Ain Dikr at Tel-al-Faras, some 12 hours from Damascus, with the cultivation round it. A detached group round Taima, the Fuqurah and the B. Wahab, are also to be reckoned among the sub-tribes of the Wulud 'Ali, but they have no political connexion with them, and fall under the authority of Ibn Rashid whenever he is strong enough to exercise it. The Fuqararah are a small poor tribe, with few camels, which depends for its livelihood partly on the payment it receive from the Ottoman Government for protecting the Hejaz railway from Dar-al-Hamra to Madain Salih, and partly on a little cultivated land which it possesses in the rocky harra of Khaibar. The Billi and the Huwaitat with their close allies the B. 'Atiyah,176 'ANAZAH are their enemies. The Aida, who are the shaikhly clan, of the southern Wulud 'AH have charge of a section of the Ho jar railway south of Madain Salih. In summer the Ruwalah draw into the Wadi Sirhan or go with the Wulud Ali towards the fertile Matkh plain, watered by the Baradah ; but the volcanic harras east of the Jabal Druz are inhabited by tribes hostile to the Anazah, the Sardiyah, a branch of the Bam Sakhr, and the Jabaliyah, composed of Ghiyadh, Bani Hasan, Masaid, and others all allied with the Druzes. With these and with the Druzes themselves the Anazah have always been at enmity. 7iT T ! 1 j Param0Unt cllicf of tile Rllwalal1 is of t}ie house of Sha'lan and the sub-tribe of Mur idh. The present representative is Nuri Ibn Sha'lan. His own sub-tribe the Sha lan, together with the Nusair, who come directly under him, consists of about 1 000 tents, but over all the Ruwalah he is unquestioned autocrat, and his authoritv is recog nized by the Wulud 'Ali and the Muhallaf. He is probably the most powerful of all purely nomad chiefs, and, since his capture of Jauf, has shown himself a successful rival of the Shammar. His son, Naw-waf, a convinced adherent of the pan-Arab party is his representative at Jauf. Though more colourless than his father, he is better educated and is considered by the Arab Unionist party in Damascus, among whom he is well known, to be the most advanced political thinker in the desert. He has the inherrited interest in the Turkish question which those of his house can scarcely escape s j ric ® ^ touches their own future so closely. Nuri himself bears a bitter grudge against the Ottoman Government by reason of his having been invited to Damascus by Sami Pasha in 1911, and there held a prisoner for almost a year. The grievance was aggra vated by the fact that he had previously offered his assistance to Sami Pasha for the subjugation of the Druzes. He dreads any extension of Turkish authority towards the desert, and strongly opposed a scheme set on foot in 1913 to carry a branch of the Heraz railway from Jizah to Qasr-al-Azraq, and thence down the west Sirhan to Kaf. In 1914 he refused to collect camels for the Ottoman Government, who were in need ol transport animals for the Egyptian campaign, thereby greatly enhancing their difficul ties. He removed his people into their eastern pasturages, where the Turks had no hold over them, and he is said to have acted similarly a year later. East of the Ruwalah and the Wulud 'Ali, the Syrian Desert up to the Euphrates m held^by the 'Amarat and by the two great sub-divisions of the Bishr, the Fida'an and the Saba'ah, who claim decent from various mythical heroes of whom Wail was the pro genitor. The 'Amarat country is the south-east corner of the Syrian Desert bordering on the Euphrates from Karbara to above Hit. The tribesmen touch the north edge of the Nafud and go down south-east into Shammar territory if pasturage is lacking elsewhere, making a temporary truce with the Shaikhs of the dirah. The early spring finds them in a wide depression, the Ga'ar, two days' journey west of Hit, while in sum mer they come back to the Euphrates, or cluster about the springs in the Hauran vallev round Al-Mat. The Faid'an range from Aleppo to Dair on both sides of the Euphrates and up to the Khabur valley almost to the Sinjar. The Saba'ah, famous breeders of camel- are seated on the middle sections of the Palmyra road. They go up towards Horns on the west, to Resafa on the east, and north almost to Aleppo. If pasture is lacking on the Syrian side of the desert, they seek it in the Fid a-'an country and in winter their shakhs come down, with those of the 'Amarat and the Fida'an, to Al-Mat and the Wadi Sirhan. The 'Amarat also cross the Euphrates on occasion, and camp with the Fida'an along the Khabur. The Wulud Sulaiman, wo roam between Taima and the Nafud, are of Fida an lineage and a part of Bishr, but they stand politically outside the con federacy ; for, like their allies and neighbours the Fuqarah, they pay tribute to Ibn Rashid. They have not many camels, but own a few patches of palm-growing lands in the Harrat Khaibar, which are cultivated, on their behalf, by the Heteim. The paramount chief of the A'marat is Ibn Hadhdhal, Fahd Bey being the present shaikh. His tents number about 3,000. He is wealthy, and owns palm-gardens at Ghazazeh near Karbala, at Baghdadiyah above Hit, and elsewhere on the Euphrates, Although his wisdom and skill in tribal displomacy is much vaunted, he is now an old man and not so active as Nuri of the Ruwalah ; nor does he concern himself with exter- nal pontics. He has suffered imprisonment at the hand of the Turks, and cordially dislike them, but his closest link with affairs outside the desert is his landed property'ANAZAH 177 tm tlie Euphrates. He fears that if the Hindiyeh escape, a part of Sir W. WilllcocFa scheme of Mesopotamia irrigation, were to be put into execution, his gardens at Ghaazah might be partly submerged, and he was inclined to blame the English for their share in that project. He could only with difficulty be reassured on this head, and shown that the better d.istribution of the water woul d be of benefit to himself in common with all other landowners. A more striking personality is Hakim Ibn Muhaid, who, with Hakim Ibn Gaishish, rules over the Fida'an, some 3,500 tents in all. Ibn Muhaid is possibly second only to Nuri Ibn Sha'lan in the 'Anazah federation. He is a man of about 40, vain, money- loving, and strongly pan-Arab. His position on the middle reaches of the Euphrates enables him to close the riverine road to traffic whenever he pleases. Until the Baghdad railway is completed, this road is the customary, and by far the shortest, means of com munication between Aleppo and Baghad, and is now connected with Constantinople by a railway. The Saba'ah are less numerous, some 1,800 tents all told ; their ruling families are the Bani Murshid and the Bani Hadaib. Upon all the 'Anazah the Ottoman Government levies, so far as it is able, a sheep- tax and a camel-tax. The great shaikhs receive Ottoman subsidies paid with something less than regularity. The sums are not large. A man like Nuri may be given about £20 a month, paid to his agent in Damascus, who uses the money for the purchase of necessary supplies which he sends out to his chief in the desert. The Ruwalah, who raise no crops, are entirely dependent on Damuscus for provisions. The paramount 'Anazah sheikhs, Ibn Sha'lan, Ibn Hadhdhal, Ibn Smair, and Ibn Muhaid, could each of them put into the fields from 1,500 to 2,000 men, armed and mounted on camels, with a small proportion of horses. The Saba'ah sheikhs could muster another 1,000. The united 'Anazah forces would therefore number about 9,000 men, if it were conceivable that they could ever be gathered together at the same time *—an exceedingly improbable contingency in regions where there are no adequate means of communication and none but a Icose tribal organization. Xor are the condi tions of pasturage and water-supply prevailing in the Hamad, suitable to large concen trations of men and animals. The total number of camels among the Kuwalah, Fida'an and Saba'ah must be greater than in any other part of Arabia. They cannot, all told, be reckoned at much less than an average of 50 to a tent. The Wulud 'Ali are not so well supplied, but they may own about 20 to a tent. At this estimate the camel-herds of the northern 'Anazah would touch a very large figure—some 600,000 animals.

The Bani Ruwahah of this valley belong to the Aulad 'Aqld, 'Awamir, Wilad Harmal, Wilad Hasan, Wilad Husain, Bani Na'aman and Wilad Sulaiman-bin-'Umr sections of the tribe. The total number of inhabitants is about 6,000 souls. Among them are some of the Hadiyin tribe. Livestock are estimated in all at about 200 camels, 350 donkeys, 350 cattle and 2,500 sheep and goats : these are divided approximately in proportion to the size of the vil'a^ea. Wadi 'Andam forms, from Khadra Bin-Daffa' downwards, the boundary between the districts of 'Oman Proper on the west and Sharqiyah on the east. The affluent called Wadi Qant which comes in at Majazah, has its head at Saddi in 'Oman Proper and forms the boundary, from that place to Khadhra Bin-Daffa', bet ween 'Oman Proper and Slmrqiyah. It apparently contains three or four of the villages described in the articles on 'Oman Proper. ANGULA (W adi)— A small watercourse in north-western Arabia, which trends south-westwards across the flat level plain stretching away south of Q vsr-al-Azraq.— {Butler and Aylmer: Jan- uary 1908.)

The soil about Qasr Ibn Ansar is sandy encrusted with salt, and of the nature of quick sand. {Leachman, 1910). ANT A'A— A considerable village in the Wadi-al-Miyah tract of the Hasa district it is situated about 50 miles inland, westwards from the foot of Musallamiyah bay, and it lies ap proximately 140 miles south by east of Kuwait Town and 160 miles north-north west182 ANT-ANT of Hofuf. It stands in a hollow and is surrounded by hills. The isolated position of Anta'a and the one or two small villages which adjoins such as Ghhafa and Imlaijah it is very remarkable. Ant a'9. is surrounded by a mud wall, 12 feet high and 2 or 3 feet thick, which has a small bastion and is pierced by 2 gates one on the north and the other on the south side of the village. There are about 250 houses and the people are Hadhar or settled Arabs belonging to various tribes, among them the'Ajman,'Awazim, Bani Khalid, Mutair, Eashaidah and southern Shammar. There are 3 or 4 mosques and a small school; the people are Sunnis. A few date groves, containing about 300 trees, adjoin the place and wheat, barley, maize and lucerne are grown by irrigation from wells. The water is the best in Wadi-al-Miyah. Livestock include about 5 horses, 30 camels, 150 donkeys and 120 cattle, besides sheep and goats. The bazaar consists of 10 shops, and artificers such as blacksmiths, carpenters and tailors are to be found in the village ; wooden bowls of a special pattern are made here. Some of the inhabitants take part in the pearl fisheries of the Persian Gulf in the hot weather. Anta'a is said to have come into existence after and in consequence of, the destruction of Thaj in the same neighbourhood. The Amir, at present Muhammad-bin-Habib of the Tuwalah subdivision of the Southern Shammar, is the political head of the whole settled population of Wadi-al Miyah. It is said that the people of Anta'a are now rendering Zakat to the Shaikh of Kuwait, though admittedly resident outside his juris diction, but it is not certain that they have discontinued the blackmail which they used formerly to pay the 'Ajman and Bani Haji tribes to let them alone. The sur rounding Bedouins are accustomed to warehouse their dates with the inhabitants of Anta'a to whom they pay hire, and to withdraw them as required.

ANTUFASH (Island)— An island in the southern end of the Red Sea (centre. Latitude 15 0 42 N., Longitude 42 0 25 E.) It consists of a sandy plain 6 miles long east and west, about 1J miles wide at its centre, and 2| miles at its western end wherp it rises to between 50 and 60 feet in height, the south-western point being of a brownish colour, cliffy, and about 20 feet high. Antelopes are plentiful on Antufash Island, but no fresh water has been found. There are occasionally two or three huts to be seen on the island, the huts being occu pied by turtle fishermen. {Bed Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot, 1909.)ANZ—AQA 183 'ANZ— A small village in Hauran, about 6 miles south of Salkhad.

'ANZ (Jabal)— A small mountain in the Hazam district of Najd and constituting one of the western outliers of Jabal Shammar. It forms a useful landmark, along the route between Tayma and Hail. 'ANZAH {or 'Anaizah)— A station on the Hejaz railway, nearly 263 miles from Damascus. It is built at an elevation of 3,478 feet, and except for some rain-water cisterns on the Syrian Hajj routs close by, it has no water supply. ANZAN (Jabal)— See (Jabal) Haddad. AOSAH— Some hillocks in Mesopotamia lying about 6 miles to the west of the Baghdad-Kar- bala road at a distance of 7 miles south-west from the town of Mahmudiyah. 'AQABAH— The name given to the broad, level tableland which shuts off the Hadhramaut valley from the sea. It has a general direction of east-north-east and west-south-west, and an average height of about 4,000 feet. It is strewn with black lumps of basalt and is per fectly level save that there occasionally rises up above the plain a flat-topped mound or ridge, some 80 feet high, the last remnant of a higher level which is fast disappearing. It wears a desolate aspect, there being no signs of habitation. Only here and there are a few tanks dug to collect the rain water when any falls. These are protected, or rather indicated, by a pair of walls built opposite one another, and banked up on the outer side with earth and stones, like shooting butts. The 'Aqabah is exclusively Bedouin property, and whereever any herbage is to be found, there the nomads drive their flocks and herds. Of the frankincense which once flourished over all this vast area little remains on the highland itself though it is still to be found in the more sheltered gullies ; and further east in the Mahri country there is reported to be a considerable quantity left. The Somali come from Africa to collect it, purchasing the right to do so for sometimes as much as fifty dollars. They go round and cut the trees and after eight days return to collect the exuded sap. 'AQABAH— A village in Ru'us-al-Jibal {q. v.) AQABAH (Ahl)— One of the two clans of the Bani 'Ali section of the Bani Hadiyah division of the Shihuh tribe (q. v.) AQABAH (B irkat-al)— One of the most important stations on theDarb Zubaidah between Najaf and Haill It is situated just north of the escarpment known as Jal-al-Batn, and between the latter and Jal Waqsah. It possesses a very fine cistern 360 feet long, and 197 feet broad, partly in ruins and buried in the sand ; nevertheless it contained water at the time of Huber's visit in 1881. There is a second cistern in ruins and without water. There are also remarkable wells here. The first lies to the north of the great cistern and is 14 or 15 feet square, and is lined with masonry to a depth of 25 feet, the rest being hewn out of the rock. The second well, situated in the middle of a large building now in ruins, is also square, the sides measuring IIJ feet. The third is 6 feet 6 inches inAQA-AQA diameter, and the fourth, situated 116 feet north-east of the great cistern is 13 feet square All these wells, which are works of art, and executed with the greatest care have a depth of nearly 200 feet. They were however, dry, and the labour expended on them has been in vam.— {Huber). 'AQABAH (Gulf of)— T he north-eastern arm of the Red Sea, nearly 120 miles long, with an average width of about 12 miles, separating the Sinai peninsula from the Hejaz district of Arabia. It is subject to violent and constant north winds increased by the high ranges of mountains bound ng both sides of the sea which opening like a funnel towards Syria draw the cooler atmosphere of .the northern regions to this part with such force as to raise a swell against which no sailing ship can make way ; the gulf is consequently almcst devoid ot native craft. 1 rom May to October the climate is insupportably hot The rainfall on the coast is practically nil, but in the adjoining hills copious rains fall in the spring months and in the late autumn. Outside, and to the east of the entrance to the Gulf are the islands of Tiran and Sam fir on which the Turks have long since intended to build barracks for the Aqabah Gulf garrison. The Gulf of 'Aqabah is the Sinvs Aelanificus of antiquity, and may be described as the eastern of the two divisions into which the Red Sea bifurcates near its northern extremity It penetrates into Arabia Petraea in a north-north-eastern direction from 28 to 29 32 A., a distance of 100 miles, and its breadth varies from 12 to 17 miles. Its entrance is contracted by Tiran, Sanafir, and other islands, so that the pass age is rendered somewhat difficult; and its navigation is dangerous on account of the nu merous coral reefs, and the sudden squalls which sweep down from the adjacent mountains, many of which rise perpendicularly to a height of 2,000 feet. The gulf is a continuation southward of the Jordan-'Araba depression. Raised beaches on the coast show that there has been a considerable elevation of the sea-bed. The only wall-shel tered port is that of Dhahab {Lit. gold) on its western shore, about 33 miles from the entrance and 29 miles east of Jabal Sinai. Near the head of the gulf is Jazirat Fir'aun {mediaeval Grdye\ a rocky islet with ruins of a castle built bv Baldwin T (c. 1115 A.D.). ^ n 'AQABAH (Q al'at-al)— A settlement lying on the eastern side of the head of the gulf of the same name. It consists of an old square fort, a few a mud hovels chiefly occupied by fishermen and some military huts on the eastern slopes overlooking the bay. Tnc shore is very low at the head of the bay where the Wadi-al-'Arabah debouches. The village extends some 800 yards along the shore, and is surrounded by groves of date palms. Opposite the fort, and some 400 yards south-east of it, is the only anchorage, in 15 fathoms of of water. The shore along which there is a depth of 2 to 5 fathoms, is low and consists of black sand. The rise of the spring tide is about 4 feet. Just to the west of the fort is a small jetty. 'Aqabah was formerly of importance as a depot for the supply of water and provisions for pilgrims on their annual journey from Cairo to Mecca, via Suez and the Sinai peninsula. Since pilgrims from that district now, however, proceed by sea to a point further down the coast, thence striking on to the rail, its importance in this respect has now greatly diminished. On the other hand the place was till quite recently uti lised in conjunction with the forwarding of troops to the Yemen. Such troops are now sent through the Suez canal. Water is obtained from wells, the large deep well which was used in former days to supply the pilgrim caravans being situated in the fort. Drinking water of a fair quality can be obtained by digging a few feet down, while some good springs exist just north west of the village. The amount of water available varies with the seasons. In the summer it is reported that 5,000 men would be the maximum number that could he supplied, while from November to April sufficient water for as many as 15,000 men mizht be obtained. &amp; About 2J miles from the head of the gulf and on its eastern side is the village of 'Aqa bah, with a picturesque mediaeval castle, built for the protection of pilgrims from Egypt to Mecca. In the neighbourhood are extensive groves of date-palms, and there is an ample supply of good water. 'Aqabah is of considerable historical interest and of greatAQA-AQA 185 antiquity, being the Elath or Elath of the Bible, and one of the ports whence Solomon's iieet sailed to Ophir. By the Romans, who made it a military post, it was called Ael &amp;na. It continued to be the seat of great commercial activity under the early Moslem Khalifs, who corrupted the name to Haila or Aila. In the 10th century an Arab geo grapher described it as the great port of Palestine and the emporium of the Hejaz. In the 12th century the town suffered at the hands of Salah-ud-Din, and thereafter fell into decay. In T841 the town was recognised by Turkey, together with the Sinai Penin sula, as part of Egypt. At that time Egyptian pilgrims frequented 'Aqabah in large numbers. In 1892, on the accession of the Khedive 9 Abbas II, Turkey resumed pos session of 'Aqafeah, the Egyptian pilgrims having deserted the land route to Mecca in favour of a'sea passage. In 1906 the construction was begun of a branch line joining ^Aqabah with Ma'an and thus giving through railway communication with Beirut. Early in the same year the Turks occupied T^bah, a village at the mouth of a small Stream S. miles by land W. by S. of 'Aqabah. Tabah being on the Egyptian side of the frontier, great Britain intervened On behalf of Egypt, and in May 1906 secured the with- ■drawai of the Turks. The Arab tribes in the neighbourhood possess some horses and a considerable number tif camels. The latter are, however, removed during the summer months in order to find better grazing. In the year 1905, during the march of 14,000 to 16,000 Turkish troops from Ma'an to 'Aqabah for embarkation for the Yemen, the principal Bedouin tribe on the route, the Huwaitat, and a subsidiary tribe, the Ibn Injad, supplied 1,500 camels for bringing water from the springs in the adjoining hills to the halting places, where is was stored in barrels. There is a telegraph line between 'Aqabah and Ma'an. 'AQABAH (Zamar-Al)— A halting place f shown on Hunter's map of Arabia as being on one of the routes running from Mecca to Al-Madinah, via Rabigh. According to that authority it is about 22 miles north-east irom Rabigh.

Inland the depth of the district is on the average about 20 miles. On the landward side 'Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, by the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and by Qatar on the north-west. The coast of 'Aqal is embayed by a great opening, Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin, which is 20 miles deep and, being about 16 miles wide at its entrance, occupies nearly a half of the whole sea frontage of 'Aqal; this mlet is rather nearer to the Khor-al-'Odaid end of the district than to the other. The depth of the bay varies over the greater part of its extent from 4 to 10 fathoms, bat in different parts of it there are shoals. The soil of 'Aqal in the proximity of the sea is fairly firm, and the land rises in steps to a height of several feet; behind the ridges thus formed, which are of a reddish colour, lies a tract of heavy dark sand with hillocks of light-coloured sand occurring at intervals. The principal camping grounds in the district are the following :— Name. • Position. 4 • Remarks. Phuwaihin About 10 miles inland south-westwards from the foot of Dohat-adh- Dhuwaihin. The principal camping place in the district. There is 1 well about 2 fathoms deep, surronded by 10 smaller one each a fathom deep: the water of all is good. Nakhalah ('Aqalat- an) 5 to 10 miles inland, south south-westwards, from the foot of Dohat- an-Nakhalah. The spot lies among sand hills. Good water occurs near the surface over a considerable area. The place is frequented by the Manasir and AI Morrah. Nathll (Saudah) .. 20 to 25 miles inland, west wards, from the foot of Khor-al-'Odaid. Wells yield good water at 1 fathom. 'Odaid ..

Water is good, in wells 1 fathom deep. The Bedouins do not regard 'Aqal as geographically included in Oman, which in their view is terminated on the west by the Sabakhat Matti; but the district has been recog nised by the British Government as forming part of the territories of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and it must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial ■'Oman.

'AQARQUF— • ; A lake in Iraq, which when full stretches almost from the Baghdad railway at Kadhi- main to the Euphrates, its southern limit being the Baghdad-Fallujah road. The water supply is obtained almost entirely from the Euphrates in flood time. The fall in water surface between the Euphrates in flood at the intake channel (the SaqlawTyah) and the Tigris in flood at the out-take, is 31 feet and therefore a heavy flow of water takes place. In order to prevent this large volume of water from getting into the Tigris and threatening Baghdad, Midhat Pasha, Wali of Baghdad, caused an earthen dam to the built across the intake on the Euphrates at Kananiyah about the middle of the 19th century. This bund which is still in existence, is repaired every year before the floods and a second bund has been built one mile down-stream of the first in case of accidents. The Saqlawiyah Canal, as its head on the Euphrates 12J miles upstream of Falliijah, has a width of 70 yards and a depth of approximately 20 feet with very steep side slopes. After a devious course of 36 miles it losses itself in the 'Aqarquf Lake ; its bed has a fall over this disance of 13 feet. A channel known as the Khar takes off from the south-eastern corner of the 'Aqarquf Lake and flows into the Tigris about 1J miles down stream of Baghdad. This channel only carries water when the lake is nearly full and has a depth then at its shallowest part, which is at the place where it takes out of the lake, of 3 feet of water. The Khar is crossed by a steel bridge about 100 yards long and 10 feet wide. The flooding of the 'Aqarquf Lake is due either to a failure of the bunds at the head of the Shaqlawiyah Canal, or the bursiting of the Euphrates' containing bunds up stream of the Saqlawiyah. When the latter event occurs the water pours into a deep cut which joins up with the Saqlawiyah about 3J miles from its head and flows down into the Lake. Some five years before the great war, a small steam tug, the Berinji, drawing 3 feet of water, was taken, during the flood seasons, from the Tigris to the Euphrates by way of the Khar, the 'Aqarquf Lake, and the Saqlawiyah, reaching the Euphrates at a point near the ruins of Ambar. Apparently the only difficulty experienced on this occasion was that of keeping to the channels. During the passage the tug had a occasionally to be dragged back into the channel out of the paddy fields which border the Lake. Between floods the lake shrinks to an area of about 4 miles by 2, and appears to be shallow although it never completely dries up. The water is then brackish but quite drinkable. French beans are largely grown over the area left by the receding water.188 AQA-AQD The Aqarquf mound, which may be seen for a considerable distance from the Bagh dad-Falluj ah road, and Which is surmounted by ancient ruins, stands on the edge of the lake and probably covers a city and temple of the Kassite period. These ruins are sometimes known as 'Aqar Nimrud. Near the mound are gennrally about 100 Arab tents, with flocks of sheep and goats. The Baghdad-Fallujah road, for the first three miles, runs along the top of a high bund on account of the heavy inundations caused by the Tigris when in flood. As far as Khan Notah the road keeps near the southern edge of the 'Aqarquf Lake and is pass able for carriages at all times. From Khan Notah onwards, untrl the high desert ridge fs reached, the road is liable to be damp and heavy for wheels, but detours can be made to avoid difficult portions. 'AQARIYAH— See Bahrain Island. 'aqaw A t— See Shatt-al-'Arab. 'AQBI— Same wells in R-adSif [q.v.) in the Hasa district of eastern Arabia* 'AQDAH— A remarkable amphitheatre or bay in the eastern slopes of Jabal 'Aja in Northern Najd ; it is formed by the junction of several small valleys within the mountains. The elevation of its floor is 4,020 feet above the sea or about 500 feet above Had, but the climate is exceedingly hot in summer. The hills which surround 'Aqadah are inaccessible from the outside, and the only entrance to the place is by a nar row gorge called Ri'^al-'Aqdah 6 miles west-south-west of Hail which is 100 yards wide at the mouth but contracts, further in, to 50 or less. At the narrowest part it is barred by a dry-stone wall about 10 feet high and 3 feet thick, in which at the southern end is a gate way with a heavy iron gate, broad enough for 4 camels to pass through, abreast. The approach is capable of defence by a small number of riflemen posted behind the wall and upon the hill on its flanks. The various interior valleys of 'Aqdah are overhung by naked granite crags, and their floors are of granite covered with 12 or 15 feet of a gravel which contains- much moisture and supports plantations of date trees aggregating about 75,000 palms. The various groves are walled, and each contains a hamlet named after the clan of the Shammar tribe which inhabits it; they are :— ? Abaid, 'Abdullah, Aqni, 'Ali, 'Ata, Fadhil, I&gt;hiyab, Hamil, Jabar, Jinidah, Mufadhdhal, Rakhls, Salit Shlrah, Shumailah and Zawaimil. The total number of houses, which are of sun-dried brick, is about 460 ; and the largest villages, are 'Abdullah and Mufadhdhal with 40 houses each,' Abaid with 35, and S-humailal^ with 30*. The fixed population is estimated at 1,500 souls and this is increased by 500 during the date season when Bedouins who own some of the date groves are encamped in them. About J the palms belong to the permanent inhabitants, J to Bedouins of the Shammar tribe and J to the Amir of Jabal Shammar ; the plantations belonging to the Amir and his relations are situated in the middle of the valley where the subsoil contains most water. Besides dates-, limited quantities of maize, millet and fruit are grown. 'Aqdah is regarded by the Al Rashld as their ancestral stronghold, and various members of the family own forts in it large enough to accomomodate their households in time of danger. In spite of the abun dance of its dates 'Aqdah, it is believed, could not on account of the paucity of its other resources stand a siege of more than 3 months.* Another authorityf describes 'Aqdah as a fortress in the mountains, some miles, from Hail, approached from the plains by a narrow winding valley bounded on both sides by granite'rocks which rise abruptly out of a bed of sand. It is a position of great natural strength, made stronger by some rude attempts at fortification. Inside the defences the valley broadens out into an amphitheatre, formed by the junction of three or four watercourses in which there is a village and a palm garden. The watercourses ♦ The Blunts. t Erom the M, R. &lt;m Syria, lyll.AQD-AQI 189 tHemselveff are filled with wild palms, watered, so the Arabs say, by the hand of God Certainly it is done by no human agency. Towering over all are naked granite crags which run down sheer into the wddi beds from 1,000 feet above. This is the site of the battle against the Ibn 'Alis, former Amirs of the Jabal, which consolidated the power of the Ibn Rashids in Hail. The valley is blocked by a wall built by 'Obaid, and there are wells, gardens, and houses within it.

'AQlQ (A l)— There are apparently two places of the name of Al-'Aqiq, both in Hejaz, and lying between Bir 'Abbas and Al-Madinah. The superior comprises the whole of the site of Al-Madinah, extending from the western ridge to the cemetry of Al-Baqi'a. The in ferior is on the Mecca road, 4 miles south-west of Al-Madinah, and is called the Blessed Valley,—{Burton). 'AQlQ (W adi)— The Wadi ' Aqiq is a torrent bed, two or three miles west of Al-Madinah, which contain - much running water after rain. It is celebrated among the Arabian poets. Burcks hardt says there were a number of ashour trees on - its banks when he was there in April 1815. The caravan routes to Al-Madinah, from Mecca and Yanbo, cross the Wadi 'Aqiq near the old settlement of Al-Maddarij ah. The latter is situated on the banks of the Wadi 'Aqiq, and is described as being a ruined village, with houses of stone, and possessing a Birkah, and a ruined well close by.— {Burckhardt.) 'AQlQ (W adi)— A valley in Hejaz, having its origin to the west of Jabal Hadn and trending north westwards till it loses itself near Jabal Tarat, about 50 miles from its source.

In the last 4 or 5 miles of their course the two valleys run parallel and close together. . The eastern valley contains the villages of Lizugh and Mizra' Bu Ba'arah; Lizugh is 11 miles up the valley on the right bank and consists of 100 houses of Nidabiyin while Mizra' Bu Ba'areh, also on] the right bank, is 8 miles above Lizugh and comprises 80 houses of Nidabiyin. At each of these villages the usual livestock are found and about 1,000 date palms. The villages of the western valley are three; Fankh, on the right bank, 4 miles from Wadi Samail, 50 houses of Nidabiyin; Da'asar or 'Aqq, on the left bank 5 miles from Wadi Samail, 50 houses of Nidabiyln, and Sinsilah, 5 miles further up, 40 houses of Nidabiyin These villages also have the usual complement of livestock and from 500 to 700 date palms each. The total population of Wadi-al-'Aqq is about 1,500 souls. Wadi Saijani joins Wadi-al-'Aqq at Fankh, apparently from the western side. A pass at the head of Wadi-al-'Aqq, 3 miles of Sinsilah, leads into Sharqiyah, and is one of the best routss thither : the topography of this part is not well understood, but the route after crossing the watershed falls info Wadi Samad. The command of Wadi-al-'Aqq is of high importance to the Sultan of 'Oman as it is one of the principal routes by which Sharqiyah insurgents have been accustomed to enter Wadi Samail and advance against his capital. The Sultan has no post in the vaUey and controls it, so far as he is able, by keeping the Nidabiyin tribe upon his side. 'AQQAN (W adi)— .

'ARAB (S hatt-al)— The largest, or, if small native sailing vessels be excluded from consideration, the only navigable river that enters the Persian Gulf; it carries the whole drainage of 'Iraq and a large part of that of Persian 'Arabistan as well. Course and general characteristics, —The Shatt-al-'Arab is formed by the confluence at Qurnah village of the Tigris and as much of the Euphrates as still flows in its old channel. The new Euphrates reaches the Shatt-al-'Arab at Gurmat 'Ali, about 7 miles by river above Basrah. In winter the swift brown Tigris the Qurnah village of the Tigris and the Euphrates ; in winter the swift brown Tigris and the feeble transparent Euph rates, the latter strained of its sediment in a journey of many days through marshes, pre sent a remarkable contract at their junction At about 40 miles below Qurnah village the Shatt-al-'Arab leaves the celebrated city of Basrah, about 2 miles inland from its right bank ; 22 miles further on it passes the smaller and less ancient but important town of Muhammareh, situated at a short distance from its left bank within the embouchure of the Karun; immediately below Fao, at a distance of about 50 miles from Muhammareh and 112 miles from Qurnah, it ends in the water of the Persian Gulf. The average direction of the river is to the south-east, but in the reach between Basrah and Muham- marah it has a more easterly and a less southerly inclination. The width of the Shatt-al-'Arab at Basrah is about 600 yards, and from Basrah to Muhammareh its mean breadth is probably about the same ; but after receiv ing the Karun at Muhammareh it expands at once to half a mile, and its dimensions thereafter gradually increase to a miximum of about one mile in the neighbourhood of its mouth.192 'ARAB Thqsea tidea affect the level of the Shatt-al-'Arab throughout its entire length raising .and lowering it by 6 to 9 feet in the neighbourhood of Basrah and by about 4 feet at Qurnah village, and they are stronger than the current of the river. Sea water, however, does not reach further than about 20 miles above Fao. The temperature of the Shatt-al-'Arab stream is sometimes as much as 16° Fahrenheit higher than that of the Karan which en ters it near Muhammareh. Tributaries. —Tributaries of the Shatt-al-'Arab deserving of mention are two only,— the Suwaib or Shwaiyib and the Karan, of these the latter is by far the more important. The Suwaib, which enters the Shatt-al-'Arab from its left bank about 3| miles below Qarnah village, comes from the direction of Hawlzeh and consists of the mingled waters, so far as not expended in irrigation, of the Karkheh river from ' Arabistan and of the Jaha. lah canal which taps the Tigris at 'Amarah. The Karan, the only really navigable river in all Persia, joins the Shatt-al-'Arab, also from the left bank, at a point about 22 miles by the course of the stream below Basrah. The Karun is described in a separate article. Island. —Above Basrah the river now contains no island worthy of note; between Basrah and Muhammareh, on the contrary, the islands of'Ajairawlyah, Tawailah, Sham- shamiyah and Umm-al-Khasasif, which are separately described under their own names, form a continuous chain reaching nearly the whole way and below Muhammareh, also there are several islands, namely Bahriyah, Gat'ah, Haji Salbuq or Muhilleh, Ziyadiyah and Dawasir ; these form the subject of separate articles. Comparison of the most recent charts with those of Colonel Chesney's expedition shows that the islands of the Shatt-al- 'Arab are somewhat unstable, or, in other words, that the main channel of the river is not constant. In 1836 'Ajairawlyah included part of the present Tawailah; the rest of Tawailah had not then been formed ; Shamshamiyah did not exist; Umm-al-Khasasif was smaller than at present and belonged to the left instead of to the right bank ; Haji Salbuq on the contrary belonged to the Arabian and not to the Persian side; and Ziyadiyah was still a part of the mainland. Navigation. —The Shatt-al-'Arab is in most respects a fine example of a navigable river. It froms as it were a spacious vestibule to 'Iraq while the Tigris and Euphrates resemble long but narrow corridors in the interior. An impressive though common spectacle on the Shatt-al-'Arab is that of a tall ocean steamer ascending or descending the river with swiftness and confidence. The great blemish of the river as a waterway is the undredged and unlighted bar, 12 miles in breadth, which obstructs the entrance. The passage over the bar is marked by a line of 5 buoys belonging to the British India Steam Navigation Company of which the positions are occasionally changed; at the present time the buoys* extend from about 6 to about 15 miles from Fao, the innermost or Bar Buoy alone being situated within territorial waters at a distance approximately of 1'7 (nautical) miles from the Persian and 2-8 (nautical) miles from the Arab shore. Steamers can cross the bar daily with a draft of 18, and at spring tides (or once a fortnight) with draft of 21 feet; but in both cases the combination of daylight and high tide must be awaited, a necessity which is liable to cause a delay of as much as 14 hours. Moreover, the soundings on the bar do not depend on the tide alone but are liable to be considerably reduced by a wind from the north, and the position and depth of the channel are variable. The bar itself ■consists of soft mud, stiffer on the Persian than on the Arab side: a powerful steamer may sometimes plough through even when the water is less than her draught, but she will list to one side when inequalities of bottom are encountered and will not steer: in this way a turbine steamer of the British India Company has been known to force her way out on an actual draft of 16 feet when there were only 13 feet of water on the bar. Any vessel which can pass the bar can also ascend to Basrah without difficulty, the intermediate soundings being commonly 24 feet or more and tho worst places not difficult. In winter the night tides are the higher and vessels unable to cross on the day tide can do so on the night tide, but pilots are reluctant to take a vessel of more than 18 foot draught over the bar at night.'ARAB 193 The depth of water on the bar varies considerably with the wind prevailing at the time. A strong southerly breeze lasting for say there days will bank up the water as much as 2 feet, while a prolonged shamal will lower it a corresponding amount. At neaps there is sometimes as little as 17 feet at the top of high water on the bar. Another, though much smaller blemish of the Shatt-al-'Arab is the Muhammareh bar and in May and June, owing to the Karun being in flood, it shifts and sometimes- hinders navigation. The obstruction at the lower end of Shamshamiyah Island, caused by the sinking of the Ekhatana and other vessels, constituted a serious danger to navigation throughout the winter of 1914-15. It is, however, slowly disappearing, and now presents no diffi culties. At Basrah, 67 miles from the sea, there is swinging room for vessels up to 420 feet in length, but in the low water season vessels of over 400 feet in length frequently ground when swinging to the tide. During the war it was no uncommon sight to see a tier of' ships at Basrah 4 or 5 miles in length. Between Basrah and Qurnah there are no- difficulties, but the draught of vessels pro ceeding to the latter is limited in the low water season to 10 feet. It is therefore not correct to say that any vessel than can cross the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab' can ascend to Qurnah. During the great war, many of the ships which brought reinforceements, besides several of the Hospital ships, were unable to cross the bar. The process of transhipping thus necessitated was usually carried out in Kuwait harbour. In the autumn of 1841, when the water was at its lowest, a'small steamer ascended 5 the Suwaib tributary of the Shatt-al-'Arab to a distance of 10 miles. Irrigation and cultivation. —The value of the Shatt-al-'Arab as a natural irrigation canal and as the fertiliser of a date-growing region, probably the most prolific and extensive in the world, is not inferior to that which it possesses as a highway of travel and commence: Below Muhammareh the river is rich in silt, contributed chiefly by the- Kartin ; and the fertility of even the higher reaches is considered by an expect authority (Sir W. Willcocks) to depend largely on mud from the Karun carried upstream by the action of the tides. Everywhere the banks of the Shatt-al-'Arab are extremely low, and in places the water—must as in Holland—be kept out at high tide by means of dykes. The watering of the plantations is a simple operation ; it depends solely on the existence of creeks and distributaries up which twice a day the tide forces the fresh river water, generally mak ing it rise to within 2 feet or less of the general ground level. Between Basrah and Muhammareh the date groves are practically continuous on both sides of the river and have a depth inland of half a mile to 2 miles ; the number of trees upon this reach in Arab territory alone is estimated at over 1,900,000, includ ing those on the islands. On both banks above Basrah and on the right bank below Muhammareh there is generally a fine palm belt, but it is not so dense or unbroken as between Basrah and Muhammerah. The number of trees on the right bank and its islands below Muhammareh appears to be about 250,000. Political importance.- —The Shatt-al-'Arab in the lower part of its course is an im portant political boundary, forming, as it does, the dividing line between Arabia and Persia. From 1847, in consequence of the Erzeroum Treaty of that year, up to 1914, the left bank, from Shamshumiyah Island downwards, together with the islands of Haji Salbuq and Dawasir, was recognised as belonging to Persia, the rights of Turkey and Persia upon the river being in theory equal. In 1914, however, the Turco-Persian Boundary Commission awarded the whole of the Shatt-al-'Arab, with the exception hereinafter referred to, to Arabia. The Persian frontier, as demarcated by that com mission, strikes the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab at a point 9 miles (crowfly) above the mouth of the Karun river. Opposite to this point is Kharnubiyah Island, the stream between which and the mainland being known as Nahr Khaiyin. From here the boun dary line runs down the middle of Nahr Khaiyin into the Shatt-al-'Arab which is met at a point nearly 1J miles above the mouth of Nahr Abu Jidf, on which stands the village of Failiyeh. From the south of Nahr Khaiyin the boundary line is carried but into the middle of the main cannel of the Shatt-al-'Arab which it follows to almost the and of Umm-ar-Rassas Island where it rejoins the Persian bank at a place called Tuwaiqaty C52(w)GSB 2c'ARAB 1 f 5 , 0 ' Mow the embonchurs of the Karvm.

Topography of the right bank from Muhamma Ko,—Here we may resume our account of the villages and tracts upon the right bank of the rivers, taking them in theARAB 207 order in which they occur from a poin nearly opposite the embouchure of the Karun down to the sea, the distance by river being approximately 50 miles :— Name. Mutawa' or Mutawa'iyah Nature and position. Gharab (Umm- al-). Kuwais A tract; it begins immediately below Zain from which a creek (leaving the river 1 mile west-south west of the mouth of the Karun and exactly opposite Umm-ar-Rasas on Umm-al-Khas a s I f island) divides it ; and from this creek, which is known as the Mu- tawa' creek, it ex tends down the bank for nearly 1J miles. A tract, extending downstream from the old Turkish police post on the border of Mutawa' for nearly a mile to a group of 7 conspicuous palm trees, well known as As-Saba' or The Seven. The inland boundary is formed by the Mutawa' creek which runs behind this tract at a distance of 1| miles from the river. A tract), extending for f of a mile from the border of Umm-al-Gharab to the southern extremity of the Mutawa' creek, and bounded on the inland side by the Mutawa' creek. Inhabitants and houses.

Samyah A tract, extending trom the Bat'ah creek for 2^ miles down to the Saihan creek. 350 souls of mixed tribes ; they live in scattered huts, ex cept in one place where about a dozenhuts are col- lectte to form a hamlet. This district was ori ginally part of the next (Saihan), but it lecame the property of the Sulfcan of Turkey and takes its separate name from the Dairat- as-Saniyah, by which it was administered, The da ^e groves, which are valuable, contain about 10,000 trees. The livestock of the cultivators amounts to some 30 cattle, 100 sheep and goats and 4 horses.

A creek which divides it from Dorah is known as the Ma'amir creek. Inhabitants and houses. 1,500 souls of the 'Idan and 'Itub tribes, occupying huts which form about 12 distinct hamlets. 1,500 souls of mixed tribes, partly Mun- tafik, distributed among about 25 small hut villages, each of which as a rule stands on a separate little creek of its own. The district has a small population for its size. It is thus somewhat similar to Fao. Remarks. See article Dawasir Dis trict. C52(w)GSB This is a prosperous tract containing about 12,000 prolific palms : grapes, oranges and figs are cultivated as well as dates. Live stock are estimated at 120 cattle, 200 sheep and goats and 160 horses. Bricks were formerly made here and a large kiln is still a conspicuous object a little below the middle of the tract, but the industry has now ceased in consequence of the cost of transport to Basrah. This was the starting point of a boat expedition sent by Yusuf-bin-Ibrahim against Kuwait in 1902. Date palms are estimat ed at 6,000, and livestock at 450 cattle, 300 sheep and goats, 50 horses and 30 donkeys. The tract is not fully developed having come into existence as a settle ment only during the last 30 years.

(T ribe)— One of the Hinawi tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate {q.v.). ARABAH (B ani)— The singular form of the word, which is 'Arabi, is avoided as it is ambiguous/meaning also a hill-donkey. The Bani 'Arabah are a Ghafiri tribe of the 'Oman 'Sultanate, found chiefly in Wadi Tayln, where their principal places are Sibal, Qurr, Hammam and Shat. Twenty years ago they are said to have been a large tribe ; but they | are now much less numerous in consequence, chiefly, of the ravages of cholera, and pro bably do not exceed 1,000 persons.

It swarms with cormorants, being covered in the season with their nests and young ones ; and there is a deposit of guano, a few inches thick, all over it. The question of the owner ship of 'Arabi has never arisen, and there is apparently no reason for regarding it as the property of one territorial power rather than of another. 'ARABI— The singular form of (Bani) 'Arabah ; the term is, however, not used at it also means hill donkey. 'ARABID (N ahr A etjl)— A small creek, in Persian territory, meeting Nahr Khaiyin about a mile down stream from Nahr Da'aiji.

'ARAFAT ( JABAL)— A celebrated mountain in Hejaz, in eastern Arabia, situated at a distance of about 14 miles to the north-north-east of Mecca. In shape it is pyramidal, and consists of a mass of coarse granite, split into large blocks, with a thin coating of withered thorns. The mountain is about one mile in circumference, and rises abruptly to a height of 180 to 200 feet. A dwarf wall at the southern base forms the line of demarcation of the mountain, which is separated from the spurs of the Taif hills by the Batn Arnah, a sandy vale. At the base of it are the springs which feed the conduit leading to Mecca. On the summit there is a paved platform surmounted by a stone beacon. The surrounding country is rough and mountainous, especially to the east, but 'Arafat itself stands isolated in the middle of a level, scrub-covered plain. The days of the pilgrimage to 'Arafat are the 8th, 9th, and 10th of DhilHijjah. The camp is formed round the hill on the flat, and covers several square miles.—-{Burton ; Wavell.)

ARDH-AS-SAWWAN (District)—• The Ardh -as-Sawwan, or Flint Country, is a plateau in north-western Arabia, three days'* journey in extent, and consists of a smooth limestone floor, gently rolling in a great folds, which underlies a bed of gravel sometimes eighteen feet deep, and is sprinkled evenly with countless flints worn smooth by the sand-bearing wind, and polished and glistening in the sun. The gravel bed is of the pleistocene age, and holds many wrought flint instruments. The surface is hard and tough, the top soil having been blown away, leaving the contained flint pebbles. It is too hard to take an impression easily, yet the desert is tracked and rayed in all directions by smoothly * worn paths which'are probably of an immense age. This desert of flints is not entirely featureless.' The Bedouins here, like the nomads of all the districts of Arabia, have names for every wddi, pasturage, and depression, for every little hill and curiously-shaped rock. Its boundaries may be roughly fixed as follows : on the north, ridges known respectively as Waqf-as-Sawwan, Jabal Thleithuwath, and Jabal Arrha, that is, the ' Northern limit of the Basalt Region n * ; on the south, the water courses immediately to the north of Jabal Tubaik ; on the west, the ridge which runs about parallel to, and to the east of, the Hajj, route; and on the east, the Wadi Sirhan. The average height of the Ardh-as-Sawan is a little less than 4,000 feet, and actually reaches these figures along its eastern border. In addition to those already mentioned, this plateau contains the following physical features : The two wells of Bayar in the wddi of the same name; Jabal Mataha, 12 miles south-east of the Bayar weUs ; Gharamil Khinzlr, some low hills about 30 miles north by west from the IJausa well; and Wadis Tharwi, 'Ausaji, Bayar, Gharra, Hasa, and Hidrij, in the north-west of the plateau and all trending north-east.—(X&gt;oir/%; Carruthers.)

The only data for determining the dimensions of the Aridh district are those deducible from the in formation about routes which is contained in the articles on Najd and Dhrumah and from the facts that are known about Wadi Hanifah. From these it would appear that the district, to neglect a portion on the north-east which lies outside the Tawaiq system and should not perhaps be reckoned to Aridh, measures about 80 miles, from north to south and the same from east to west. Physical features and geogrophical division, —The physical conformation of the district is by no means simple. The chief range of Jabal Tuwaiq traverses it, as we have seen, from north to south towards its western end and may be used as a base from which to describe the district. The 'Urmah and 'Araimah ranges, subsidiary features of the Tuwaiq system, leave the principal range in the Sadair district and, gradually inclining away from it in a south-easterly direction, ends somewhere Riyadh and the Dahanah desert. Part of Aridh, that which was left out of account in estimat ing the extent of the district, lies to the north-east of this subsidiary range on the side towards the Dahanah; and another portion, containing numerous villages, is included between the lesser and the greater range. Towards the south end of the district Wadi Hanifah takes its rise in the eastern slopes of the main Tuwaiq range and, travelling eastwards with a souherly inclination, leaves 'Aridh by the south-eastern corner. Still further south but on the western side of Jabal Tuwaiq, is the plain of Dhrumah from which a valley descends eastwards, piercing Jabal Tuwaiq on its way to join Wadi Hanlfah in its lower course. Between Wadi Hanifah and Dhrumah, Jabal Tuwaiq appears to extend considerably further eastwards than it does in the north. The recognised geographical divisions of the 'Aridh District are not, unfortunately, altogether determined by the physical features—in themselves sufficiently perplexing '—which have just been described. It has been possible to describe the southern parts of the district under the titles WSdi Hanifah and Dhrumah without in any way violat ing native usage ; but it is more difficult to know how to deal with the remainder to the north of Wadi Hanifah which consists of two hills ranges, inclined towards one another at their northern end, and of three plains, one of which is between the ranges while the others lie outside them on the extreme east and extreme west. The plain on the extreme east is named 'Urmah. It is bounded on the south-west by the subsidiary range already mentioned, and on the north-east by the Dahanah desert ; its breadth between the two is 1J days' journey with laden camels or about 45 miles. On the north 'Urmah is said to reach to a locality called Batainiyat and it extends far enough south and east to include the wells of Abu Jifan on the route between Hofuf and Riyadh. A dry watercourse, commencing in the subsidiary range and named Thama- mah, intersects the plain from south-west to north-east and is eventually lost in the Dahanah desert; to the south of it, in a parellel dry torrent bed, are two groups of wells called Rumah and Rumhiyah, of which the latter is about 8 miles nearer to the source of the torrent than the formr. In the neighbourhood of these wells is a customary halt ing place on the route from Kuwait to Riyadh ; Riyadh lies about 70 miles or two long camel marches to the south-south-west of Rumah, and on the way thither the village of Banban is either passed through or left some distance to the right. Also to the south of Thamamah another torrent bed called Misajidi, which has its rise in the same hills, crosses the plain in a similar direction and is also lost in the Dahanah. The plain of 'Urmah is itself stony and barren and broken up into low hillocks some of which are flat and some conical, with intervening hollows. The remainder of the district, consisting of the principal chain of Jabal Tuwaiq north of Wadi Hanifah together with the plains on the east and west of it, is sometimes included in the term Mahmal, to which however certain authorities wotild assign a much more restricted meaning. The village topography of Mahmal will be found in a'iRIDH 217 table at the end of this article ; at present we are only concerned with its more outstand ing physical features. The true centre of Mahmal is a large depression named Khafs in which rain water is said to collect and stagnate for as much as a year together ; it lie- between the main range of Tuwaiq and the subsidiary range ; and it is fed by the drain age, after rain, of valleys coming down from both. In Khafs, under the 'Urmah range, are quarry-like pits called Dahal Khafs in which rain water stagnates. About a mile or so east of these pits is the entrance to the Manfaikh gorge through which a route runs out on to the 'Umrah plain. From this gorge water courses drain respectively south-west into Dahal Khafs and eastwards towards the 'Urmah plain. The latter of these watercourses apparently forks in the 'Urmah plain, one branch going north towards the Ghadir-al-Hajj, a distance of about a dozen miles, and the other eastwards to the Sha'ib-at-Toqi and the Rumhiyah wells. South-east from Dahal Khafs, perhaps 10 miles, a second gorge (Manfaikh being the other) occurs in the 'Urmah hills and gives access north-eastwards to the 'Urmah plain down a watercourse called Sha'ib-at-Toqi, which drains to the Rumhiyah wells. The southernmost and most important of the valleys on the western side of Khafs is Wadi Wutar which comes down from Sidus : at Salbukh, perhaps 20 miles below that place it receives on its left bank a tributary coming down from Qasr Harqan and Ghiyanah; and before reaching Khafs it is joined, again on the left, by the Abu Kithadah torrent bed of which the head is near Haraim- lah, while Malham is situated on its middle course. Wadi Wutar is a deepish well defined valley, and between Sidus and Salbukh it cuts through a mass of hills ; in its lower course it contains, at least at times, a certain quantity of running water. North of Wadi Wutar another hollow carrying the drainage of Dqalah Diqail and Mah- rlqah finds its way to Khafs. The outlying part of Tuwaiq on the east side of Khafs appears to overlook the Khafs basin from a short distance and to send down to it no less than 6 hollows of which the names in order from north to south are Khanasar, Hifnat- at-Tairi Tauqi, Hamamah, Hamaiyim and Thamamah ; of these the last-named has its origin in the same part of the range at the torrent similarly named which goes down to the 'Urmah plain upon the opposite side. This eastern range of Tuwaiq rises less than 1,000 feet above 'Urmah and it is pierced by a remarkable gap, through which runs the route between Kuwait and Sidus. Somewhat further north than Khafs and the drainage hollows connected with it is a depression, on which are situated the three villages of Safurrah and further down the hamlet of Hasi; its course is at first north and then north-east and it ends a short dis tance to the east of Hasi at a hill named Khatilah, which is described as standing soli tary in the desert like a ship at sea. This hill is said to be about the same heghit as Jabal Sanam near Safwan and on the east side of it are wells, 4 fathoms deep, known as Qulban-al-Khatilah . Beyond this hollow of Safurrah and Hasi, but rather perhaps to the west than to the north of it, are two others which convey the drainage of Bir and Thatiq away in a direction which has not been exactly ascertained but is probably northerly. Another interesting feature of Mahmal that calls for notice is a depression furrowing the plateau (apparently styled Sad-hah) between Sidus and 'Ayainah on Wadi Hanifah ; this hollow is named Ghallah, it begins a m ile or two from Sidus, and it eventually enters Wadi Hanifah just above the village of Jabailah. At about 10 miles from Sidus Ghallah is blocked by a masonry dam forming a reservoir called Haqar which is close to the road from Sidus to 'Ayainah upon its north-east side ; when this reservoir is filled by rain it is expected that a spring at 'Ayainah, called 'Ayainat Bin-Mu'-ammar,. will begin to flow. Part of the rest of the country between Wadi Wutar and Wadi Hanifah drains to Banban and not to Khafs. It remains to mention that, on the western side of Jabal Tuwaiq, a hollow descending from the neighbourhood of Haraimlah passes Barah and ends in the swamp of Mufldh in the Washam district; while another also from the direction of Haraimlah runs down to Washam by way of Raghabah. The western Haisiyah, which is to the south of the valleys just mentioned, is described in the article on Jabal Tuwaiq. Inhabitants. —The 'Urmah sub division of the ' Aridh district contains no settled in habitants : from a consideration of the appropriate articles it will appear that the fixed population of Mahmal is about 12,500 of Wadi Hanifah (inclusive of Riyadh) about 15,000, and of Dhrumah and its dependencies about 2,500 souls, making up a non- C52(w)GSB 2f218 'ARIDH Bedouin total for 'Aridh of some 30,000 persons. In the whole district, Riyadh town being left out of consideration, the predominant tribe of respectable lineage apppear to be the Dawasir, with about 3,600 souls, who are particularly strong in Mahmal; they are followed by the Sabai' and the Bani Tamim with about 2,600 persons each, and by the 'Anizah and 'Atibah, whose numbers are about 2,000 and 1,000, respectively, after these come the Fadhul and Qahtan, and after these again the Bani Hajir, Sahul, Mutair, 'Aid, Harb and Bani Khalid whose numbers are extremely small. More numerous than any single Arab tribe, however, are the low-caste cultivators, generally grouped together under the common designation of Bani Khadir, who appear in this district to number nearly 6,000 persons. The people of 'Aridh are restless and not un- warlike and their district is the headquarters of Wahhabism. The ordinary Bedouins of 'Aridh are SabI, Sahul and, in a minor degree, Dawasir; but nomads of the Harb, 'Ataibah and Qahtan and a few Mutair also visit the district. Agriculture and resources, —The character of agriculture in 'Aridh will be understood on reference to the village lists of its various divisions, from which it will be seen that the people depend chiefly on the cultivation of dates, wheat, barley, millet, melons and lucerne, all of which are grown for the most part by irrigation from wells. There are also, in most places, fruitless trees of the various sorts met with in Najd, especially citrons, limes, pomegranates, figs and vines; vegetables also are raised in considerable variety. A large part of the district consists of pastoral uplands or downs, and the ordinary live stock of Najd are owned, in the usual proportions, by most villages. The flocks and herds graze on the lower levels in winter and the hill grass is reserved for consumption in summer and autumn. Communications, —The routes which traverse the 'Aridh District are described in the article on Najd. Administration, —The political importance of the district is proved by the fact that, despite political convulsion and foreign wars, one of its towns has always remained the capital of the Wahhabi dominions. The revenue of 'Aridh, then mostly collected in kind, was valued in 1865 at $50,000 at the present time the revenue from dates is esti mated at $ 12,000 and that from cereals at $4,000 only. The decrease is said to be due to the damage done by both sides during the recent wars in Najd. Topography. —The villages of Wadi HanTfah and of the Dhrumah neighbourhood are tabulated in the separate articles on those sub divisions of the district; those of the re maining Mahmal tracts are as follow:— Name.

Even now it is not always understood by natives to denote the same or any clearly defined region. It is convenient, however, to apply the term to all the area intervening between Uhe southern limit of Hejaz (a line drawn inland from a little to the south of Lith) and 'the northern boundary of the jurisdiction of the Imam of Yemen (about latitude 17° IS'' N.). To this must be added the seaboard and the maritime plain down to latitude 16°, where the Wadi 'Ain divides the Idrissi's territory from that of the Turks. Its ex- ^tnesion from the Red Sea to the east is difficult to define, since, as is the case with Hejaz, its eastern districts are not separated by any exact boundary from the steppes and deserts of Najd. A line drawn from the coast to Bishah measures about 180 miles. In the southern part the boundary marches with that of the Yam tribes oi Najran. ifeZie/.—Internally this region is still not sufficiently known for the details of its relief to be described ; but, broadly, it may be said that the first Hejaz zone, the low sandy maritime belt, is prolonged southwards with a breadth of twenty or thirty miles through ''Asir to meet the 'Tihamah of Yemen, while the second, third, and fourth Hejaz zones •are, in ' Asir, less sharply distinguished one from another. Instead of the low, rounded, and dusty hills which form the second zone in Hejaz, we find a lofty escarpment ('Aqabah) backed by a plateau region (third zone), which falls little, if at all, eastwards towards the toot of the main ridge of the fourth Hejaz zone. This ridge is liere uniformly higher than in Hejaz, ranging from 6,000 to 10,000 feetv From its crest-line, lying on an •average about eighty miles from the coast (nearer in the north and farther in the south), the land-level falls away gradually north-eastward towards Najd. The maritime belt, or Tihamah, is narrowed to a mere strip between Hali and Itwad where the high range of the Rijal-al-Ma' forms a distinct maritime range separated from the main central range by the broad valley known as Wadi Ahabash and its continuation southward. The height of the main range probably equals, if it does not exceed, that -of the Yemen range. In an account of the Shaiif's expedition to Abha in 1911 the -elevation of the Tanumah valley is estimated at over 9,000 feet and it is stated that the streams therein are frozen hard during the winter months. The mountains over which that expedition marched are well wooded and the higher valleys appear to be at least as fertile as those of Yemen. The climate is compared favouarably with that of the Lebanon. Physical character and climate. —Since ^Asir receives the fringe of the monsoon, which, reaches Yemen in autumn, and since it provides a lofty, gradually inclined and broad catchment area, the wide valleys which run from the main ridge, not only south- westward down the short seaward slope, but north-eastward down the long slope towards Central Arabia, are comparatively fertile. All this north-eastern slope is seamed with watercourses—main valleys like Wadi Ranyah, Wadi Bishah, and tributaries like Wadi Shahran and Wadi 'Aqiq—divided by high hills or intervals of steppe. C52(w)GSB 2a234 'ASlR The larger valleys carry water throughout the year either on or near the surface of their channels, and since large tracts of both harrah and nafud desert are absent, the aspect of the innermost zone of 'Aslr is very different to the corresponding district in Hejaz. Tamisier, who in 1834 traversed what we should now call the north-east and south-east frontiers of 'Asir, speaks with enthusiasm of the smiling and fertile appear ance of some of the valleys which he visited, but he left untouched some of the most productive districts. The principal wadis run towards Wadi Dawasir, in southern Najd. But what is their exact ultimate destination, and how far inland their fertility is main tained, we do not at present know. The inland fringe of the main ridge is almost uniformly fertile and the country from Tanumah to Tamniah compares favourably with any in the central highlands of Yemen. To the east of the main ridge, long, and broad ribbons of oasis, trending north, occur frequently and serve to keep an agricultural and settled element preponderant in the population. The dusty intervals of steppe between wadis are good for nothing except lean pasturage but the valleys themselves are well watemed and produce good crops of cereals and fruit in abundance. While doubtless invaders, such as the Egyptian armies which traversed the region from time to time between 1832 and 1841, have suffered from insufficiency of supplies, this has been due partly to the nature of the country to be crossed between the main valleys, and partly to the fact that districts fertile enough for local needs were unable or unwilling to support hostile forces of 10,000 or 12,000 men. Such a force remained encamped in Wadi Bishah for a fortnight in 1834. The district round Khamis Mishait is described in modern days as fertile par excellence, and Wadi Shahran, a tributary of Wadi B;shah, is called by Tamisier ' a jewel coveted by all conquerors.' The seaward slopes of the main ridge and the escarpments, which lead down to the Tihamah, are in the north of 'Asir barren and forbidding, except in the valleys ; in the south they are covered in many places with dense woods and traversed by many rivulets. The intervening plateau, though hotter than the Main Ridge, is never theless productive and well watered and supports a large population. While the highlands are the most productive part of 'Asir, the Tihamah or seaboard country, though throughout sandy and salty, is less barren than in Hejaz, and indeed in the Qunfudah, Hali, and Sabya districts yields a fair amount of produce. In the southern and central Tihamah, light and local rains occasionally fall in February and March, and there is a heavier precipitation in June during the season of the Kharif. Further north, both in the Tihamah and inland, the rainfall is irregular. The most favoured localities are the 'Aqabah and Main Ridge, which receive a copious precipita tion during the autumnal monsoon and occasional showers in June and July. Tamisier speaks from experience of very violent thunder and rain in the neighbourhood of Khamis Mishait in the month of July. The climate of the Tihamah, which is subject to strong south-west winds, is as hot as in Hejaz; but the water supply is both more abundant and of better quality. The inner country is cooler on the whole than in Hejaz; but the water supply is both more abundant and of better quality. The inner country is cooler on the whole than in Hejaz, the 'Aqabah and plateau being better favoured than the corresponding Hejaz zones; the climate of this hill country is described as temperate. On the inland slopes of the ridge, which has a general north-eastward aspect, the winter is comparatively severe : night frosts are regular and frequent. Population. —The total population of 'Asir, if calculated from the numbers of fighting • men mentioned later in the description of tribes, would be 750,000. These numbers, however, are based entirely on native information and should be accepted with reserve ; but they are given in the absence of any more positive and reliable data. In all proba bility they are an overestimate. The main constituent is a highland farmer element, warlike and tenacious of liberty, living in the upper wadis on both flanks of the main ridge, but only in a few places collected into urban settlements of any considerable size. Qunfudah on the coast, Muhail, Rijal, Khamis Mishait, Abha, Sabya, inland, may be called towns, and there are many large villages where the local trade is focussed: but the available descriptions of inland settlements suggest, rather than towns, villages with chains of dependent farmsteads and groups of huts distributed along the valley bottom and sides and often protected by forts on the adjacent heights. In the last century Wadi Bishah is said to have possessed sixty villages, and the number has not decreased. As in Najran, the Jauf of Yemen, and Hadhramaut, these settlements serve as nuclei'ASffi 235 of tribes with fringes of unsettled clans, which roam the intervening steppes and moun tain heights in quest of pasturage. There has always been a strong social and politica distinction between the farmers of the lower inland wadis and those of the upper parts, and the Main Ridge, the proper 'Asir, as well as between the latter and the men of the 'Aqabah and Tihamah. But the distinction goes further than this, and in no part of Arabia are the tribal elements more sharply defined or their boundaries more immut ably fixed than in 'Asir. There is an understanding, in times of peace, that members of one tribe may pass through the territories of another when furnished with a khawi or guide by the latter; but attempts on the part of strangers to settle in 'foreign' territory are seldom countenanced, nor does intermarriage often take place. This rule in relaxed only in the larger places of mixed population, such as Qunfudah, Abha, and Sabya, and in Bishah, where the Arabs from all the neighbouring tribes collect for a four months' truce during the date season and where many of them possess their own hands. In religious persuation, practically, all the 'Asir tribes belong to the Shafai school of the Sunni sect. Wahabism has a few adherents in the north-east and its tenets are regarded with a certain sympathy all over the country ; but there is everywhere a strong antipathy to Zaidism, which has made no headway. The tribes under the immediate influence of the Idrissi subscribe to his Tarlqah, whose practices and tenets are akin to those of the Senussi fraternity, and are, of course, Shafai. It is in'Asir that, proceeding through Arabia from the north, we first encounter settled tribes as the predominant element in the population, and for the simple reason that there, for the first time, the physical conditions admit generally of such agriculture as returns sufficient sustenance within a convenient radius of a settlement to render nomad ism — always a pis oiler — not necessary. Not that nomadism is unknown is 'Asir, any more than in any district of Arabia ; agriculture by irrigation in wadis has to be eked out by pasturage on the hills, and the climatic conditions cause pasturage to be too scanty and evanescent for flock-owners and herdsmen to keep within easy range of any particular settlement throughout the year. Moreover, not only do stretches of steppe, often little better than desert, occur in the 'Asir Tihamah (as in that of Yemen, and on the southern littoral), but the inland slopes of the Main Ridge (as again in Yemen and even in 'Oman) rapidly thin out into steppe land and finally into sheer desert. Therefore almost all 'Asir tribes include a nomadic clan or two, although only a few units are in the main or wholly nomadic. Settled Arabs multiply more rapidly than unsettled, and tribes which for any reason have abandoned wandering life for fixed agriculture have often been known to double or treble their numbers in two or three generations. Obvious reasons for such increaee are better quality and greater quantity of foodstuffs enjoyed in settled life, and the easier conditions which obtain for women in pregnancy and parturition and for their offspring during infancy. This fact has to be borne in mind when judging the high totals given by native authorities for the population of such regions as 'Asir and Yemen. To the former never less than about a million and a half, and often much more, are ascribed by Arab informants ; and though we may suspect even the minimum to be an excessipe figure, it is not an impossible one. No means of checking it exist, the actual numbers of fighting men known to have been put in line on any occasion being no good criterion in so divided and distracted a region. The most numerous and powerful tribes occupy the Main Ridge with the heads of the inland valley and the upper parts of the'Aqabah. Here we find in succession from north to south the great units of the Zahran, the Ghamid, the Shumran, the Bui 'Uryan, the Bui Qarn, the Bani Shihr, the four tribes of the Ahl Baraq, the Ar-Raish, Ahl Musa the Bui Asmar, the Rabi'ah-wa-Rufaidhah, and the Bui Ahmar. With the next two tribes, the Rijal-al-Ma' and the Beni Mughaid, the most famous and most developed tribal organizations in 'Asir, we reach the heart of the country, the surroundings, of Abha (Manadir), and the hinterland of Mikhlaf-al-Yemen. The strong tribes of the Alqam-al-Hul, Bani Malik (to be distinguished from the Hejaz tribe of that name), and Rabi'at-al-Yemen also lie round Abha ; and both behind all these and intruded among them, in a wedge of territory which runs from the heads of Wadis Bishah and Shahran to within twenty miles of Sabya, lies the most numerous of all' Asiri tribes, the Shahran. 2h2m 'ASIE Finally, in the south-eastern interior of the region, live the six Qahtan tribes, each an autonomous unit, and none of them to be confounded with the nomad Qahtan of the south-western region of Central Arabia. The Tihamah tribes are, as a rule, smaller units and less vigorous. In the north where the land conditions are least favourable, they take largely to seafaring. The Dhuwwi Hasan and Dhuwwi Barakat, who occupy the coast from Lith to Uruj, are fishermen and pirates. The Zubaid sub-section of the Harb, which succeeds to these, contains also some sailors, but with it and the Bani Zaid of the Qunfudah district begin predominantly agricultural units, which generally own one or more port villages, or Sitting astride the tracks to the interior, profit by commerce, even if they do not practise it. So live the Bui 'Air, the Hali federation, the Bani Hilal, and the Munjahah. Aftei the last begins the favoured and well settled district of Mikhlaf-al-Yemen, where the Idrissi has established some sort of law and order, increasing from the north, which is 1 held by the Bani Sh'ibah and the NajV to his homeland of Sabya and Abu 'Arish. His authority holds to the southern limit of 'Asia-; but the comparatively small tribes lying; south of Abu 'Arish, of which the Masarahah, the Bani Marwan, the Bani Hasan, the' Bani Aslam, and the Bani Abs, are the more important, better maintain tribal autono my, and in means and manner of life approximate to the units holding the coast north of Mikhlaf-al- Yemen. Domestic apparatus and manufacmresj—Except round Abha and Qunfudah, where the Turks have exercised a civilizing influence amongst the better-class natives, the inhabitants of 'Arsi Ive under Very primitive and simple conditions. In the Tihama their dwelling places are rounded huts of straw brushwood with pointed roofs and are generally surrounded- by a straw compound. The floors are of pounded ©lay with a raised place for a fire. Their beds resemble the angarih 3 of the Sudan, a lacing of rope or thongs on a wooden frame-work supported by four wooden legs. Up the y Aqabah and along the Main Ridge, a man's house is his fortress and is built to last. The big chiefs have huge rambling structures massively built of stone and some times running up to four or five storeys. The doors are solid, the windows square wi% wooden shutters, and the roofs flat, supported by stout beams over which are laid branches of trees and then a surface of clay. Each house has its own yard surrounded by a stone wall The houses of the Sharan and Qahtan tribes are of a similar type, save that above the first floor they are built of clay. Inside there is little furniture, but the houses are kept clean and are never used as privies, as is the case elsewhere in Arabia. For beds straw mats are used, covered with a thick sheepskinor rug. In all big houses as separate room is set aside for the kitchen. In eating, the men kneel on their haunches round a big wooden platter and- help themselves with their fingers. Copper cooking utensils come from Aden, copper coffee-pots from Mecca, while clay plates Water jars, and cups, are made locally^ 9 Artificial light is only seen in the houses of the rich, where small petrolium lamps are used. Clothes come almost entirely from Aden. The local manufactures are few and unimportant^ Certain tribes make their own goat-hair tents and saddles; saddle-bags and leathern belts are usually home-made. The Rijal-al-Ma' are known for their straw-woven articles, such as matting, baskets, and hats {toffush), which are largely worn by the women of 'Asir. Most of the swords and long curved knives (jamdbih) are finished localy, the steel being imported from Aden and worked into shape by the local smiths. The Ahl-al-Yazid section of the Bani Mughaid are noted for their skill in this manufacture. Arms and ammunition of course come exclusively from abroad, but the Bani Shihr are said to produce an inferior kind of powder. The rifles are badly treated, the sights being knocked off and the stocks pared down. It is the custom in some tribes to cut a notch onthe stock for each man killed. A (jriculture. Cultivation in the Tihamah is dependent partly on the local rainfall and partly on the water from the wadis which come down in flood from the hills. In all the larger wadi beds dams are made and the water led off in channels on to the surrounding land. In most places there are two harvets, the spring and the summer, but the Hali District produces three. The principal crops are two varieties of millet {dukkn and dura), sesame, cotton, and the more common kinds of native vegetables. The most productive regions are between Hali and Qunfudah and Mikhlaf-al-Yemen,y ASER 237 Inland, in the hillg and plateaux, dura and dersim are grown during the winter; the summer crops are wheat, barley, lentils, potatoes, and onions. Wada'a produces grapes In large quantities, which are converted into raisins and sold throughout 'Aslr ; and in tho Bani Malik country and Abha, figs, grapes, apricots, and a poor sort of olwes are gown. €ofi;ee is cultiva+3d by the Rijal-al-Ma by the Bui Asmar round Jabal Hadah, and by the Bani Mughad near Sijam and Raidah, but not in quantities sufficient for local consump tion. Dates are groy x in a few places on the coast such as Birk, but by far the largest production is in the fertile valley of Bishah, where lemons, oranges, and. duJchn are alsc cultivated extensively. Inland 'Asir is ilcher than the Tihamah, and the Main Ridge in the centre and south is almost uniformly productive. The best dist.'cts are Rijal-al-Fa', Tamniah, Barak; Abha, and Tanumah. Liveslcch —The Tihamah pioduces cattle, sheep,, goats, and camels in large numbers. Donkeys of a big white br-ed are used for riding, and there is also a smaller type grey ia colour, for carrying burdens. Hor es are only found in MikhTaf-al-Yemen and ar3 all imported from inland. There are no mules. In the mountains the same vai!eties of animals are found, but the camels are all injured to mountain work in a colder climate and no Arab would think of taking his beasts do^vn to the plains. The Tihamah-bred animals would, of course, fare equally badly inland. The n ountain camels are for the most part white in colour, but those of the Qahtan and Shahran are black. The two- latter tribes are the chief horse owxiers. They will se 1 l their poorer beats, but rarely part with their pedigree animals, of whom they take the greatest care. Dogs in 'Asir are generally we 1 1 tretated and there is a large b'ack breed which makes an excellent type of watch-dog. Trade. X.— Import Trade by Sea. —Qunfudah, Birk, Shaqlq, Jizan, and Midi are the five ports through which goods enter 'Asir. Qunfudah is chiefly used by supplying Turkish needs there and at Abha, The most valuable trade is in arms and ammunition. The Idrissi has his own agents, who bring direct to Jizan from Jibuti, and the Zubaid supply part of northern 'Asir with rifles from Ruwais near Jiddah ; but by far the largest part of the trade is in the hands of the Rijal-al-Ma', who were the original pioneers and have admitted no rivals in their central and inland spheres. The rifles are a heterogenous collection, Mausers, Martinis, Italian makes and Russian, anything in fact which finds its way to Jibuti Next in importance is the trade from Aden. The 'Asiri necessities are few and the import list is therefore short. Cotton piece- goods, steel, sugar, petroleum, rice, and cooking utensils are the chief items. At the present time trade with 'Asir is under strict control and is restricted to Jizin Interport trade from Habil to Birk is allowed under certain conditions. 2.— Import Trade by Land. —From the south, practically the only commodity which enters 'Asir is coffee. This is chiefly produced round Jabal Razih and taken in by the pilgrim road to the Qahtan country, where it is brought up by the Qahtan merchants at Khamis J Abidah. The imports from the Hejaz are still more limited and seem to be confined chiefly to copper coffee-pots. 3. Export Trade. —The export trade is only carried on at present on a small scale; but is capable of considerable development. The Tihamah exports to Jiddah wheat, dukhn, dhurah, simsim, and dried fish, chifly in the pilgrim season. The remaineder of the exports go either to Aden or Massowah. These consists of samn, skins, and wool, both from the Tihamah and inland; cotton from the Hali district, cZom-nuts from the Munjahah, gum from the Shahran and Qahtan, dates from Bisshah, and honey from the Rijal-al-Ma'. Cattle are also exported to Massowah when the absence of cattle plague permits. Merchants from the Hadhramaut control most of the general trade, both import and export, with the outside world. The Rijal-al-Ma' also take their share, though they reserve themselves chiefly for the arms traffic, and there are a few Indian traders. 4. Internal Trade. —In all the main necessities of life each tribal district is sdi- supporting. The chief distribution centres of what to the 'Asiri are luxuries, are ; Sabya (Mikhlaf-al-Yemen), Shaibain, and Rijal (Rijal-al-Ma'), Abha (Bani Mughaid) Khamis Mishait (Shahran), Khamis 'Abidah ('Abidah Qahtan), Kiad (Hali district).238 'ASIE Sabt Ibrf-al-'Arif (Bani Shihr), Khamis-al-Makwar (Ghamid), Dus (Zahran) Qunfudah (Bani Zaid). c Most of the output of dates from British is brought to Khamis Mishait for distribu tion by merchants, who go to Bishah early in the season well supplied with general goods, such as fles, ammunition, coffee, piece goods, etc. Merchants from Sabva procure all their horses from the Qahtan. ^ Wada'ah produces raisins and sends them chiefly to Khamis ? Abidah. After the Rijal-al-Ma' the most enterprising traders of the interior are the Oahtan and especially the Rufaidhat-al-Yemen section of that tribe. Recent history and present ponies.—Politically 'Asir cannot be regarded as one except on the Ottoman theory that it forms, as a whole, the northern sub-province ovsanjaq of the Wilayat of Yemen. In reality it falls into four parts one completely independent and three acknowledging, respectively, the influence of the Sharif of Mecca, the Turks, or the Idrissi. The three latter, it is hardly necessary to remark are constantly changing as the power of one or the other aspirants to supremacy waxes or wanes. j co (1) The number of Arabs who recognize no power but their own is comparatively small and is confined almost entirely to nomad tribes such as the Rabiyah Mniatrah and Rabi yet et-Tahahin, who dwell in inaccessible mountain country on the 'Aqabah and to nomad sections of certain of the eastern tribes such as the Ghamid, Shahran and 'Abidah, who wonder far out to the east, where they are beyond control. There is no cohesion or fixed purpose amongst these, and politically they are of little account (2) The Sharif of Mecca's influence is chiefly evident amongst the powerful tribes of Ghamid, Beni Shihir, and Shahran, who live on the inland side of the Main Ridge He is connected by marriage with the paramount chief of the Beni Shihir and is a personal friend of the Ghamid and Shahran shaikhs ; but he has never made any attempt to administer the country, and it is doubtful if he has much influence amongst the tribes men. In 1910 he got into touch with many of the tribes between Lith and Abha during his campaign against the Idrissi; but how far he has maintained relations since' then is a matter of speculation. (3) The Turks have never sueeeeded in completely subduing 'Asir and thev now have only a precarious hold on the port of Qunfadah and the inland towns of Muhail and Abha, with a small district round each of these places, and, intermittently, the roads from one to the other. They are in touch with the Beni Shehir and Shahran, but chiefly by virtue of their trelations with the Sharif ; in the event of trouble with the latter it is probable that they would find these tribes arrayed against them. (4) As for what remains, the Idrissi either administers or federates it, that is the Qahtan tribes of southern inland Asir and most of the Tihamah and 2 Aqabah from the Wadi 'Ain in the south to the confines of Lith, a strip of nearily 350 miles from north to south by roughly seventy broad. Idrissi's homelands is in the Mikhlaf-el-Yemen District, with Sabya as capital and the post of Midi and Jizan. This is a rather broad section of the Tihamah sloping up for some forty miles to the foot of the 'Aqabah or Bcrap of the highlands, and about eighty miles long from north to south. Before Mahammad ' Ali cost covehtous eyes on 'AsTr, the whole country from Dharan almost to Taif was in the hands of the ruling family of Bani Mughaid, whose capital was Manadir, or Abha as it is now called. The Amir at the time of the Egyptian ex pedition in 1834 was A'idh Ibn Mura'i, who, with the help of his sturdy hill-men succeeded in defeat the invaders. The country then had rest from foreign aggrcs- sion until) Sflft, when, the Suez Canal having been opened the Porte sent troops under Rauf Pasha to deal with the Yemen and'Asir in earnest. In 1871, Muhammad, son of A rfh attacked Hodaidah, but was repulsed with great loss and in the next year Mukhtar Pasha, who had succeeded Rauf Pasha, invaded and subdued 'Asir. He 'was helped by the Eijal-al-Ma' who had successfully rebelled against the Amir and were burning to avenge their defeat. The Turks administered most of the country until the revolt of the Idnssi reduced their power to its present limits. The house of A'idh, though deprived of much of its former glory, is still important, and Hasan Ibn 'Ali, the present head, is Wah or Turkish Civil Governor of 'Asir. There is m Mikblaf-al-Yemen a very old tradition of independence which has been maintained against both the Turks and Yemenite tribes on the one hand, and the tribes'ASIR 239 of the inland mountains on the other. Between 1830 and 1840 Abu 'Arish was ruled by a certain Sharif 'Ali, who made terms with the Egyptians in order to free himself from the Emir A'idh Ibn Mura'i. During his reign one Sidi Ahmad-al-Idrissi, a native of Fez, and head of a religious fraternity school {tariqah), which he had preached in a school at Mecca since 1799, acquired land at Sabya, settled there and died (1887) in the odour of sanctity. He had been the teacher of the odginal Senussi, who took the co venant in his {iarlqah) in 1823. The Idrissi family increased in wealth during the life time of Sidi Ahmad's son and grandson, and appears, after the renunciation of 'Asir by the Egyptians in 1841, to hape supplanted the Sharifial family of Abu'Arish. It intermarried with the Senussi house, settled in Cyrenaica, and had branches at Zainia near Luxor in Egypt, and in the Sudan at Argo. But the expansion of its political power to include not only all Mikhlaf-al-Yemen, but the Tihamah and Aqabah north and south and a suzerainty over several tribes outside those limits {e.g., in the Sa'adah district and even among the tribes of North Yemen) is the work of Sidi Ahmad's greatgrandson, Saiyid Muhammad, the present Al-Idrissi. Born at Sabya in 1876, educated partly in Egypt (at Zainia and at AI-Azhar, Cairo), and partly by the Senussi at Kufra, after residence at Argo and marriage, Saiyid Muham mad, returned to Sabya determined to render 'Asir independent of the Turks and to aggrandize himself at their expense. By 1910 he had driven them back to their present holding ; he took Abha, but was unable to hold it and it it was retaken by the expedi tion organised by the Sharif and aided by Turkish regulars. Subsidized and supplied by the Italian during the Tripolitan War, he consolidated himself in the south, and though the Grand Sharif seduced much of his following after the Peace of Ouchy, he recovered himself during the Balkan War. Failing, in 1914, to secure recognition from the Yong Turks as more than a Qaimmaqam of Sabya and Abu 'Arish he declared definitely against them on their entry into the present struggle, signed a treaty with our Resident at Aden in May 1915, and took the field in June with a following of some 12,000 men from Mikhlaf-al-Yemen and certain tribes of the s Aqabah and Tihamah and the Qahtan. He has not succeded, however, in taking Lahlyah though he has r overrun much of the Northern Tihamah of Qemen, and raised part of the Zaianiq and other Tihamah tribes against the Turks. His power rests largely on his personality, but to some extent also on hereditary sanctity and on the wealth and influence of his connexions, notably those with the Senussi. His most implacable foe, after the Turks, is the Imam of Yemen, and the only potentate really friendly to him in Arabia is Ibn Sa'ud. The Grand Sharif, however, is now disposed to keep on terms and is anxious to reconcile the differ ence between him and the Imam Yahya. These differences founded on jealously and accentuated by personal dislike, are probably too deep-seated to admit of more than a temporary settlement. In his early days the Idrissi was fully occupied in consolidating his newly won position ; and in any case his schemes of expansion were directed northwards amongst the Sunni tribes of Asir rather than eastwards to the Zaidi followers of the Imam. Indeed the Imam, by his opposition to the Turks, was a source of strength, and the interests of the two chiefs were so far identical six years ago that they entered into a defensive alliance, after delimiting their respective boundaries. The Idrissi was faithful to the pact, but the Imam, having failed to avert the relief of Sana'a and attracted by the favourable terms offered to him, abandoned his ally and submitted to the Ottoman forces. The Idrissi has never forgiven him for this and has always refused to listen to any proposals for a reconciliation. He has gone further and for some years has been actively end- deavouring to undermine the loyalty of the Imam's western tribes. He was fartunate in finding a favourable field for intrigue amongst the powerful confederation of the Hashid, which had bitterly resented the peace proceedings at Da'an in 1911, and he has succeeded in keeping them estranged till the present time. In 1913, in consequence of complaints from the inhabitants, he sent an expeditionary force to Jabal Razih, which lies between Abu 'Arish and Sa'adah, and has since administered that district. At the present time he is credited with the ambition to extend his dominions still further at the expense of the Imam. He is in communication with most of the important Shaikhs of the Northern Yemen, who are said to be ready to rise if adequately financed and armed. Whether the influence of the Sharif of Mecca is sufficiently great to induce him to forego these ambitions is a matter of speculation, but it can at least be said that240 'ASlR the Imam's rupture with the Turks is a necessary preliminary and that the Iclrisgi is in a position to drive a harder bargain than in 1910. Military organization and resources. TurJcish. —The Turkish forces 'Aslr consist of the 21st Independent Division, com manded by Muhi-ud-din Bey and composed of the following units; — Infantry Regiment No. 118 p battalion). Infantry Regiment No. 121 {3 battalions), 0. C. Assim Bey. Infantry Regiment No. 122 (3 battalions), a C. Faizi Bey. Infantry Regiment No. 123 (3 battalions), 0. a Ali Rida Bey. The 123rd Regiment seems to have been formed shortly before the war. The batta lion of the 118th arrived in 'Asir from Yemen in the autumn of 1913. Companies are about 160 strong and the total force was estimated afabout^OOO in November 1915. ' It is divided between Qunfudah and Abha, with a preponderance at the latter place. In 1914 there was also a strong post at Muhal, but it is not known whether this is stiJl iield. There are also the following corps troops i — Four mountain batteries. One train company. Two machine gun companies. One telegraph company. Four Mantelli 7 • 5-centimetre guns at Abha. In addition to the above there are four companies of locally recruited foot-gendarmes cand one company of mounted gendarmes. The Turks can also count upon the support of the tribes in the immediate neighbour hood of the places which they hold. Round Qunfudah they have the Bani Zaid and the Beni la^alah, neither of them fighting tribes, but, as they showed in 1910 quite ready to take up arms against the Idrissi The Turkish hold on Muhail is precarious, as they only have a section of the A1 Musa with them, and it is probable that they would abandon this place, if indeed they have not already done so, in the event of genuine attack by the Idrissi. Round Abha their position is stronger. By intermarriage and the grant of civil honours to its principal Shaikhs they have gained the support of the powerful tribe of the Bani Mughaid and they can also count on the ' Alqam-al-Hul and the Banl jMalak. Their influence extends also to some of the Shahran and Bani Shihar • but these tribes are more particularly faithful to the Sharif of Mecca and would not assist the Turks except against the Idrissi, and only then if the latter were still at enmity with the Sharif. J 2. Idrissi.—The Idrissi's standing army consists of about 500 Sudanese reeurited from the villages round his capital, Sahya, and chiefly used for police work or as his personal guard in normal times. In times of war he depends entirely on the tribes for support. His system is simple. He has about ten maqadim or generals, almost invari ably chosen from the leading families of Saadah (Saiyids) or Ashraf (Sharifs), each of whom is entrusted with a district or a group of tribes with which he is required to keep in touch at all times. When troops are required, each general is ordered to produce a specified number of men and he in turn makes the tribal sheikhs responsible for carrving out the order. Exemption is purchased by the payment of twenty-four rials. The army thus formed is a conglomeration of small bands, skilled in tribal warfare but untrained and undisciplined according to European standards, and generally divided against itself by petty tribal quarrels and jealousies. Each tribal unit brings its own food and as many rifles as it can, and the Idrissi is responsible for making up the number and for supplying ammunition. In addition, he has to make handsome presents to all the chief shaikhs. Unless there is a good prospect of loot, it is difficult to collect the Arabs in any numbers, and in any case their natural independence and thdr dislike of restraint render them unsuitable for a long campaign. This and their disinclination to face modern artillery were among the chief causes which led to their failure before Lahiyah m 1915. The Idrissi is poorly supplied with artillery and its ammunition and with trained men to serve the guns. Theoretically he can put a very large army into the field, but m practice he probably cannot muster more than 25,000 men for offensive purposes. He is hampered by the fact that the tribes refuse to go far from their own boundaries and therefore he has to depend on the material available in the particular district in which he is operating.I2C 'ASlE m TRIBES OF 'ASIIt. 'ABlBLAH ( al)— One of the twenty tribes of Ashraf, descended from the Quraish, 1. By far the more important section is that settled in Mecca, of which the present Sharif of Mecca, Husain Ibn 'Ali, is the head. It consists of about 200 members. 2. There is a small colony of them which has been settled for many generations in the Bani Qutaba country of the Rijal-al-Ma. Their influence is local and unimportant. Sharif 'Abd Ibn 'Abdullah is their leading representative. 3. Another small colony has lived for many years with the Dhuwwi Barakat, about four hours east of the Shaqat-al-Yamaniyah. They are allied with the Dhuwwi Barakat and friendly with the Zubaid. Their chief Shaikh is Sharif Talib Ibn Qasim. 'ABlDAH— See Qahtan. AHMAR ( bul)— The Bul Ahmar live in the rich highland country to the north of Abha, their southern boundary coming to within ten miles of that town. The tribes which adjoin them are in the north the Bul Asmar, on the east the Shahran, on the south the Bani Malik, and on the west the Rabi'ah-wa-Rufaidhah. The tribe is a strong one and numbers about 7,000 men of whom 4,000 are settled and the rest nomad. Their country is well watered and produces fruits as well as cereals. The paramount Shaikh of the settled portion is 'Abdullah Ibn Milham, a young man of 25, who is liked by the tribe both for his justice and the open house which he keeps. He is a warm supporter of the Idrissi and collects taxes for him, 'Ali Ibn 'Abshan, or 'Ali Ghalib Bey as the Turks call him, is the nominal head of all the nomads, but for the last few years he has only had the Al 'AsVa under his control. In his younger days he went to Constantinople and received a military training for five years. On his return to Asir with the rank of Bimbashi he was appointed by the Turks chief tax-collector for the whole district. When the Idrissi revolted he stood by the Government but was not supported by the Bul Ahmar who, with the exception of the Al 'Asla'a, all went over to the Idrissi. For the last few years he has lived entirely at Abba, fearing to go back to his country. He had a house in the village of Mai aha in the Bani Malik district which was razed to the ground a few years ago by Shaikh Saiyid Mustafa of the Bahr Ibn Sukaina,the chief general of the Idrissi in Asir. His son 'Ali was one of the first to be chosen to sit in the Ottoman parliament, but on his return from Constantinople was captured between Qunfudah and Abha by the Idrissi's men and died in captivity at Sabya about six years ago. 'Ali Ibn 'Abshan himself is now about 55 years of age and is said to be brave and capable. The Bul Ahn ar say that they are descended from the Rijal-al-Hajar, but they are probably from some other stock, since they are fairer than other Arabs and most of them have red hair which they wear short, and light eyelashes. The villagers have a reputation for cowardice, but the nomads are stout fighters. The whole tribe, however, has an evil name for treachery and theft anc^are known amongst other tribes as Kilab- an-Na'al, intimating that as a dog in the night they will steal the shoes from their sleeping guests. The Bul Ahmar are friends with the Bul Asmar, Rabi'ah-wa-Rufaidhah, and Bani Malik, but are enemies of the Shahran. (a) Settled. 4,000 men. Paramount Shaikh: 'Abdullah Ibn Milham.

They are bounded on the north and north-east by the Zubaid, east by the Rabi'ah Muqatrah the Rabi'at-Tahahin, south by the Aulad-al-Alowna, and west by the Marahiba section of the Bani Zaid. They are divided into two main divisions, the Nawashara, 3,000 men, and the Al- 'Umur, 4,000, the former partly settled, the latter entirely nomad, and ranging the country to the south of their borders. Their situation astride the two main roads from Qunfudah to Muhail is an excellent one for raiding,, and they take full advantage of it. They hate the Turks, who can only pass through their country in force. The chief Shaikh is 'Ali Ibn Madini, a man of 50 r who was formerly paramount Shaikh of the whole tribe. He was bought over by the Sharif of Mecca in 1912, and his desertion of the Idrissi lost him the support of all the Al-'Umur and of the Nawashara with the ex ceptions of the Firsha and Sada clans, and the inhabitants of the village of Qoz Bui 'Air. The tribe is still split in two, and Shaikh Ibn Khaira of the Nawashara has gathered most of the power into his hands, and is reckoned amongst the Idrissi adherents. Their country includes both plain and hills, and is rich enough to give pasture for large herds of camels^ goats, and cattle, and to grow cereals in the rainy season. They are allied with the Zubaid, but are generally at loggerheads with their other neighbours. The most extreme section and the one most feared by travellers is a colony of about 300 of the Dhuwwi Barakat called the Ashraf Manadil, living at Manadil, Just to the west of Qoz Bui 'Air on the main road to Qunfudah. They have lived there for many years and have severed all connexion with their parent tribe, but they have retained the tribal reputation for lawlessness. , Their chief is Sharif Abu Talib, who pays; allegiance to 'Ali Ibn Madini. The colony, however, keeps to itself and does not inter marry with the Bui 'Air nor does it adopt the local custom of allowing its women to go unveiled. The Bui 'Air Arabs are lax in their marriage customs, but they do not marry outside their own tribe. Although truculent and quarrelsome, they have a reputation for clean fighting, and are hospitable to those with whom they are not at feud.

Their northern boundary adjoins the Bui Qarn and on all other sides they are surrounded by the Bani Shihr, the noma ! ic IS aid being to their east and the settled Ka 'ah to their south and west. Their country is well watered and productive, wooded except where the ground has been cleared for cultivation. 1 he chief Shaikh is Sa'id Ibn 'Uthman, who lives at Ash-Shij, and Is said to be a good tribal chief The Bani 'Amr number about 2,000 men and are hospitable and a fane lighting tribe. They have always been violently anti-Turk and about ten years ago, under Sa'id Ibn Uthman, defeated a strong Turkish column led by Muhammad Amin i asha which was sent to subdue them. They pay allegiance to the Idnssi but not to the extent of allowing him to levy taxes. They are allied with the Bui Qarn and have an old feud with the Ka 'ab, Bani Karim, and Naid sections of the Bam Shihr.

The adjoining tribes are the Bam Shihr on the north, the Shahran on the east, the Bul Ahmar on the south, and j Ar - E aish on the west. They are said to be descended from the Rijal-al-Haiar and are of the same stock as the Bani Shihr. They dwell on the fertile slopes of the hills and up to the long proclivity known as the 'Aqabah Sajain to the top of the main * im-u , v, r0 aceor dingly as the people of the mountains and the people of the Tihamah. Much coffee is grown on the hill terraces, and wheat and other cereals round the villages, Jabal Had ah is the chief centre of the tribe and the most productive. The Abha-Taif road runs through their territory for about seven miles between Madfa'a and Tanumah. The paramount Shaikh of the whole tribe is ' Ali Ibn Muhammad, a man of 50, tall and powerful, with a scar over the right eyebrow. He lives at Al-Madfa'a and is a firm adherent of the Idrissi, as are the rest of the tribe. The Idrissi takes taxes from them. In former days Turkish influence reached them, but since the Idrissi's rise to power thev have been left alone. r J The Bul Asmar are friendly with the Bul Ahmar and the Bani Shihr ; with the Ar- Raish and Shamran they are at enmity.

They are fconnded on the north by the AlMusa.on the east first by the Bani Thuwwa and then by the Rijal-al-Ma , on the south by the Rijal-al-Ma' and on the west by the Bani Hilal. They number 1,000 men of whom 600 are settled and the rest, the Latim and the Makhluta, nomad. They share with the Bani Hilal the reputation of being one of the most unregenerate and irresponsible tribes of 'Asir, and the nomads are still Moslen 8'AS IE 245 merely in name, though the influence of the Idrissi during the past few years has done something to reform them. They have never acknowledged the sway of the Turk nor have the latter been able to subdue them. Their country in the highlands of 'Asir is thickly forested, abounding in running streams, but only a little has been cleared for cultivation. Their paramount Shaikh is Saiyid Mustafa, a man of 35 years of age, and one of the most prominent figures in 'Asir. He belongs to a family of Sa'dhah and not to the tribe itself. In 1912 the Idrissi placed him in supreme command of the forces opposing the Turks and the Sharif of Mecca. When the fighting was over the Rijal-al-Ma who will suffer no outsider, complained to the Idrissi against his being put over them and even went so far as to try to murder him. He has his own tribesmen thoroughly under control and is looked up to as a stern but just ruler. He is responsible for collecting tribute for the Idrissi and, reserving for himself a quarter of all he receives, has grown rich and lives in some state in J anna. The most serious engagement in the war of 1912 took place atMayadi in his country resulting in a check for the Idrissi. The Bahr Ibn Sukaina claim kinship with the Rijal-al-Ma, and are usually on good terms with them. They reckon the Bani Thuwwa amongst their friends but are always at feud with the Bani Hilal and Al Musa. Chief Shaikh: Saiyid Mustafa. 600 men. Villages : BARAKAT (D htjwwi)— The Dhuwwi Barakat are one of the tribes of Ashraf related tp the Quraish. They occupy a barren stretch of the sea-coast from Shaqat-ash-Shamiyah and about 25 miles south and extend inland for about 14 miles. The Wadi Doka runs through their country and provides water for their annual crop of idukhn and dhurah. They number only 400 men, but make up for their paucity of numbers by their reckless daring. Coastal dhows give their shores a wide berth, for they live chiefly on what they can make by piracy, and in their swift vessels take toll of all who come their way. Their chief is Sharif Hasan Abu Mandil, a man of about 45 years old, who recognizes the au thority of neither the Sharif, the Turks, nor the Idrissi. His right-hand man and the one most noted in raiding is Sharif Muhammad Ibn Saida. They maintain a perpetual feud with their piratical rivals the Dhuwwi Hasan, but are on friendly terms with the Zahran, their eastern neighbours, and with the Zubaid to their south. There is a small colony of' Abadlah Ashraf in their country, which is allied to them. An offshoot of the tribe lives at Manadil in the Bui 'Air country.

The district of Baraq begins about IS miles north of Muhail, and covers an area of about 20 miles from north to south and 30 miles from east to west. It is a fertile country with plentiful rains and is largely cultivated, simsim being the principal crop. It is bounded on the north and east by the BaniShihr, on the south by the Ar-Raish, Al Draib, and Rabi'at-at-Tahahin, and on the west by the Rabi'ah Muqatrah. The most important tribe is the Humaidah, numbering 7,000 men, of whom 4,000 are nomads. They occupy the western part of the district, and the Muhail-Qunfudah road fromDhahab to Ghar-al Hindi is in their territory. They quarrel with the Al 'Isbai and are divided amongst themselves, the villagers favouring the Turks, the nomads the Idrissi. Muhammad Ibn Hai'aza is their Shaikh, and the paramount Shaikh of the whole district by the nomination of the Idrissi. He is a man of about 45, and has the reputation of using his position with wisdom and moderation. The Al Musa Ibn 'Ali occupy the south-eastern portion of the district along the first stages of the Baraq-Tanumah road, and number about 3,000 men. They are entirely sedentary and agricultural, and disagree with the Al Jabali. They are friendly with the Ar-Raish and the pro-Idrissi section of the Al Musa. } The Al 'Isbai are between the Al Musa Ibn 'Ali and the Humaidah, and north of the Al-Jabali. Both the Al Tsbai and Al Jabali are entirely settled in villages. Taken as a whole the tribes support the Idrissi, with the exception of the settled Humaidah, and pay him taxes. They are peaceful and pleasure-loving, and by no means fond of war. At the same time they are not above harrying small Turkish convoys. The road from Muhail to Qunfudah, however, is so beset with unfriendly tribes that the Turks seldom pass over it except in numbers sufficiently large to repel any ordinary attack.

Chief villages:— Al-Mifa. Uthrub. BISHR (BANI)— See Qahtan. UI The B A 1 -ad-Duraib are a small tribe numbering some 800 men, to the north-west of Muhail. They occupy about ten miles of the Sikkat-al-Halawiyah from Muhail to Qunfudah between the villages of Turqush and Ma'amal-al-lkhlaif, and stretch up along the Baraq road for about five miles north of Musahbah, which is in thejr territory. They are bounded on the north by the Al Musa, west by the Ar-Raish south-east by ^the Al Musa, south by the Bani Hilal, and west by the Rab.'ab Tahahm, They are a good fighting race, but are not naturally quarrelsome or bellicose. The Idnssi, how ever frequentlv incites them to cut Turkish communications. Their country is fertile, and they possess many flocks and herds. The Al Musa and Rabi'ah Tahahin are friendly to them, the Al Jabali, Ar-Raish and Bani Hilal as a rule inimical. They have the reputation of being hospitable beyond the ordinary, and travellers can journey without fear in their country. . it , j • xt There is a small offshoot of their nomad sub-section, the Al Ikhlaif, situated m the Rab.'ah Muqitrah country near Ghar-al-Hindi, who have cut themselves a drift from the main tribe. , . ™ * tt i i. Muhammad Ibn Akhu 'Abdia, a man of 35, is the chief Shaikh. He has been to Mecca several times, and frequently goes to Sabya.

GHAMID— The Ghamid own a wide stretch of territory in the highlands of southern Hejaz and northern Asir, roughly from latitude 19° SO 7 to 20° 15' and longitude 41° 30' to 42°. The tribes which adjoin them are, on the north the Shalawa, east Shumran, south Bui Qarn and Bui 'Uryan, and west Zubaid and Zahran. It is difficult to e.- timate their numbers, reports varying from Burckhardt's estimate of 5,000 to 10,000 fighting men, to a native estimate of 60,000 men. The first is probably as wrong as the last, but there seems no doubt that they are considerably more numerous than any of their neighbours. , . n . The inland road from Abha to Taif runs through the midst of their country, which is well watered and fertile. The tribe is divided into two portions, the nomad and settled, who are always at odds with one another. The nomads are Al Saiar, a tall race of fine fighters who live to the north of the settled portion and roam far afield to the Shalawa country round Turabah, to Ranyah, Tathlith, and Wadi Dawasir. They are rich in horses, camels, and goats, and recognize no authority. Their chief is Muhammad Ibn 'Abdur Rahman, a man of about 45, and a noted warrior. He is entirely inde pendent of outside influences. The chief of the settled Arabs is ' Aziz IbnMushaid, a young man of 25 years of age, who follows the Sharif of Mecca and frequently visits him. He is at enmity with Muhammad Ibn 'Abdur Rahman. A large number of his men go yearly to Mecca,248 'ASlB ^ f Taif, and act as porters during the pilgrim season. They remain there for about four months, and return with supplies for the rest of the year. Many invest . - ( j\ r ® ayln Sf m rifles, which they buy at one of the two chief markets, Ar-Ruwais near Jiddah or Xuzula Bam Malik. They also buy rifles from the Rijal-al-Ma'. Although not noted for their fighting skill they are frequently at war, their chief foes being the Zahran, and after them the Bui Uryan, Bui Qarn, Shumran, and Shahran. Even the ^ 0 t re !j 0 ®. r I combine with them when trouble with the Zahran anses. Their friends are the Zubaid and Bani Malik of Hejaz. 1 Their women occupy a much more important position than in most tribes and take an equal share m all harder forms of mannual labour, and even have a say in the triba' eouncils The tnbe is still nicknamed the Khadimin-ad-Darwisbah a woman who died about fifty years ago, having ruled them for nearly 40 years. The women a^so weave camels hair garments and blankets. Owing to the annual migrationTJhlr jj , the tribe is more civilized than most and has a good reputation for hospitality. In May 1915, some of their Shaikhs, whose names are not known, wrote to the Idrissi proposing to join him. The Idnssi advised them to keep quiet until a more favourable moment arrived, but sent a Qadhi to collect money from them. At the beginnin* of 1916 he was still m communication with them. A man of importance in the tribe is Salib Ibn Ajala. He is the richest merchant and controls most of the trade between Mecca and the Ghamid. The export of tobacco of which a considerable amount is grown, is entirely in his hands. Another man of influence is Muhammad Ibn 'Ali of the Bani Kabir. He was chosen as one of the represertatives of Asir in the Ottoman pariiament ten years ago, and went to Constantinople for one session. Not liking the life, he resigned his seat, tat st ll keeps up his Turkish connections. uut hwu Paramount chief; 'Aziz Ibn Mushait. (a) Settled. Bani Dobiar, Bani Kabir. Bui Jurashi. Humran.

Their country embraces the coastal village of Hali and. the surrounding district of the same name. The boundary starts from the coast about five miles north of Hali, runs north-east along theBani Ya'la territory, and thence follows a line paralled to the Hali-Juma'at Rabi'ah Juma road and about four miles to the west, up to Kidwa, which is 18 miles north- north-east from Hali close to the boundary of the Al- Umur section of the Bui Air. Thence it goes south-east for about ten miles along the Rabi ah Tahahin and Bani Dhib territory to Kiad, which is 21 miles north-east of Hali. Here it reaches the Bani Hilal and follows their line towards the coast, which it touches about 12 miles south of Hali, The four tribes are the 'Abid-al-Amir, Al-Ghawanima, Aulad-al-' Alowna, and Kanana, who are all settled with the exception of the Salalma clan of the 'Abid-al-Amir ajid the Fillaha clan of the Aulad-al-'Alowna, both small and unimportant units. The largest tribe is the Aulad -al-'Alowna, who number 3,CC0 men and are strung out along the Juma'at-Rabi'ah rdad from Kidwa to Minjiya. Next in importance are the Ohawa;nima {1,500) from Radhato Khal along the Muhail read, then Kanana from the Bani Hilal to Minjiya and finally the Abd-al-Amir (600 men) on the Bani Dhib frontier. The paramount Shaikh over all is Ibn 5 Aji, a man of about 55, who in the past was a, friendijof the Turk: , but seceded to the Idrissi when the latter began to grow power ful. The Turks used to occupy Hali, but they were driven out about 1900, and have been unable to regain a footing. The confederation is a rich one, having sufficient water for its agricultural needs and possessing large herds of cattle. They are noted warriors and maintains feuds with all their neighbours. The Rijal- al-Ma' are the only tribe whom they regard with friendly eyes. Their relations towards each other are at times strained, but they unite for common defence and when the Idrissi calls them out. The 'Abid-al-Amir were originally slaves of Sudanese stock, but have long since gained their emancipation and now rank on an equality with the Arabs. A number of them go every year on the pilgrimage to Mecca, where they have an evil reputation for robbery and theft. The Kanana are an ancient and famous tribe, who probably came into being about a. d . 100, and are descended from the Mudhar branch of Nizat. The Quraish are a branch 'of them. They were at first settled near Mecca, and took a prominent part against Muhammad the Prophet, by whom they were subdued. When Africa was invaded part of the tribe went to the Sudan, where they are still in Kordofan while others went to Egypt and from there pushed as far west as Morocco. The Arabian remnant had meantime taken up their residence near Hali, where they were reported to be by Ibn Batuta in 1353. Some severe fighting took place in the Hali country during the campaign of the Sharif of Mecca and the Turks in 1910, in which the Ahl Hali, who were fighting for the Idrissi, gave a good account of the mselves.

HASAN (D huwwi)— The Bhuwwi Hasan occupy the coast-line from just north of Lith down to Shaqat- ash-Shamlyah, a distance of about 45 miles, and inland to the beginning cf the moun tains, which are here only a few miles from the sea. They are of Sharifial stock and con- nected with the Quraish, but they do not reflect credit on the tribe, for they pay small attention to religion and concentrate all their energies on piracy, being the most noto rious band of free booters and sea robbers along the-whole coast. The Turks have a garrison about two hours inland from their main town of Lith, and exercise a certa'n restraint over them, but the Dhuwwi Hasan hate both the Turks and the Sharif, and what little deference they show to anyone is paid to the Idrissi, who is sufficiently far away to be attractive. Sharif Mustur represents the Sharif at Lith, nd collects a certain amount of taxes. The chief of the tribe is Sharif Muhammad Ibn Hasan Ibn-al-'Ud, whose name is known with dread by every sailor along the coast. Almost equally feared are his fol lowers, Sharif Ismail Abu Khurfan, Sharif Rajib Ibn Dajhid, and Murzut Ibn Bakhit, a Sudanese slave who won his freedom by his skill in raiding. They are friendly with the Zahran and Jahadla, their eastern and northern neighbours but have a long-stand ing feud with the Dhuwwi Barakat, who lie to their south. The Dhuwwi Hasan possess many slaves, and the cruelty with which they are treated Is notorious in the Hejaz. Blacks captured at sea are invariably enslaved and ham strung to minimize their chance of escape. Chief Shaikh: Sharif Muhammad Ibn Hasan Ibn-al-'Ud. 3,000 men. AlAsaf Sharif Hasan Ibn Husain.

HILAL (Bani)— The Bani Hilal occupy a broad expanse of country stretching from the Sikkat-ash- Sharaf, between Hali and Mu3hail, to Birk on the sea shore. Their exact boundary starts at Sabt-as-Sawala about 23 miles from Hali and runs just north of the Sikkat-ash-Sharaf and Wadi Dofa'a up to within 4 miles of Muhail,Q 'ASlR 251 % total distance of about 34 miles. On the north they are bounded by the Rabi ah TahabTn and Al-ad-Duraib. From Sirr the boundary goes south-west to Birk marching first with the A1 Musa, and Pnally near the coast with the Munjahah. The coast ia theirs for about 18 miles north of Birk, and then the boundary goes inland and so up to Sabt-as-Sawala along the Hali border. The country is densely wooded and provi des pasturage for large herds of camels and goats. The tribe is divided into the Ah! Birk, the A1 Ikhtarsh, who live in the direction of Muhail, and are subdivided into the A1 Misjar and A1 Am Jama'a, and the Arabs of the western parts whose subdivisions have not been ascertained. The A1 Ikhtarsh are said to number 5,000 men and the remainder, including the Ahl Birk 7,000. The Ahl Birk and the Arabs inhabiting the villages along the sea coast, such aa Nakhl-al-Birk, Nahud, and Sobakha, form the only respectable portion of the tribe. They cultivate a little, grow date-trees in some of the villages, and supplement this by collecting salt near Birk, which they sell to the neighbouring tribes. Muhammad 'Abdus is the chief Shaikh, a man of 35 years of age and a staunch adherent of the Idrissi. He is nominal chief over the whole tribe, and does in fact have considerable influence over them. But to keep them entirely in check is almost an impossibility for they have the well-earned reputation of being one of the wildest and most intract able tribes of the Asir. i -n j Almost pagan, they lead an entirely nomadic life, subsisting on meat and milk and buying what little they need from outside. They have closed the Sikkat-ash-Sharaf to the Turks, who are obliged to travel by the more northern roads, the Sikkat-al- Halawiyah or the Baraq road, and even ordinary travellers do not dare to pass through their country except in large armed parties. As far as they may be said to have any politics, they are pro-Idrissi, but they are far too out of hand to be of value as allies. They afe at daggers drawn with all the neighbouring tribes with ths exception of the Eijal-al-Ma', whose hand they fear. 'AU Ibn 'Abdu, the Shaikh of Birk, was recently reported to be in the pay of the Turks and to be smuggling mails up to Abha, but the well-known attitude of the tribe renders this improbable. In 1910 the Sharif tried to suborn him with the offer of £3,000. 'Ali Ibn 'Abdu's only reply was to send him a Mauser cartridge. Muhammad Ibn Hasan, chief of the A1 Ikhtarsh, is a notorious highwayman, and has a bad reputation for treachery and cunning. 1. Ahl Birk . Chief Shaikh: Muhammad Ibn 'Abdu of Birk.

The tribe numbers about 600 men. khatham— The Khatham are a small settled tribe on the Abha-Taif road, with the Shumran to their north and west and the Bui Qarn to their east and south. They do not muster more than 1,500 men and are partly nomadic. The chief village of the settled portion is Lasfar, where lives their chief Shaikh Jahaish Ibn 'Aqad, an old man of 60 ^ Ihe nomads are camel owners, and are almost all engaged in the carrying trade to Bishah and JSiamas. They excel in fighting, and are allied with Bui Qarn and Shumran,252 Their eliief menace comes from the Ghamid, and the Khatham, Bui Qarn, Bani 'Ami?, and Shumran all unite aganist that powerful tribe when it threatens any one of them. In politics they favour the Idrissi. The tribe traces its descent back to the Rijal-al-Hajar. Paramount Shaikh : Jahaish Ibn 'Aqad of Lasfar. (а) Settled sections :— Al Murra Thawwab Ibn Nasir.

Theyare of Qahtan Stock, and with the Bani Mughaid, Rufaidhat-al-Yemen and Alqam-al-Hul form what is strictly speaking Asir, The tribe numbers about 5 000 men of whom 2,000 are nomads. The villagers are under Shaikh 'All Ibn Ma'addi, and are divided into the three chief clans of Al-al-Mujammil, Bani Rizam, and Bani Rabi'ah. They are Turkish in svm- pathy with the exception of the Bani Bizam, whose Shaikh, Tahir Abu Hashar was imprisoned for a year at Abha for attempting a revolt. They all pay taxes, and are peaceful and unwarhke people, looked down on by all the neighbouring tribes, who have named them m derision ' Jaouba ' or donkeys. The nomads are good fighters, and pay only a nominal allegiance to the Turks Thev come mto the villages during the harvest, and for the rest of the.year Wander to the east round JnJur, and isolated village of theirs in the Shahran country, or go down to the Alqam-al-Hul or Rabi ah-wa-Rufaidhah. They are at enmity with the Bani Thalaba sec- tion ol tne IJul Ahmar. The country is fertile, and largely supplies Abha with fruits. Ah Ibn Ma'addi, the chief Shaikh, is an old man of 60, and is a member of the Abha town council. He is reported to be mean and avaricious.

MUGHAID (B ani)— The Bani Mughaid are a fine fighting tribe dwelling in the steep hill country 'which leads up to Abha from the south and in and around Abha itself. The adjoining tribes are on the north the 'Alqam-al-HiU and Bani Malik, on the east of the Shahran, on the south the Sha'af Rasha and Al Yinfa'a sections of the Shahran and the Rabi'at-al- Yemen, and on the west the Rijal-al-Ma'. Their southern limit is the| Wadi Shahla, which; flows into the Wadi Dhila at Haidat-at- Tihamiyah. The tribe numbers about 7,000 men, of whom more than 5,000 are firm adherents of the Turks, and as their fortresses are practically impregnable in Arab warfare- they are a valuable asset to the Ottoman Government. The tribe is divided into seven divisions, the Al Ya.zid, Al Najih, Al al-Wazi, Al Am Sharaf, Al Am Jaraiat, Al Am Wadi Mala, and Al Waman. Their country is fertile, with running streams, and produces coffee and fruits. The Al Yazid are the ruling clan and are subdivided into the families of Ibn Mufurrih, Al Abu Sarah, and Aulad-al-Amir Muhammad Ibd 'Aidh, who ruled supreme over all Asir before the days of the Turks and the Idrissi. The Idrissi's rise to power has split up many a tribe in Asir which was formerly united, and the Al Yazid have not escaped the general feeling of discord. The head of the Aulad-al-Amir Muhammad Ibn 'Aidh, is Hasan Ibn 'Ali, a young man of 26, who has already distinguished himself in battle. He was at one time with the Idrissi, but in 1910 was bribed by the Sharif of Mecca and seceded to the Turks, who made him Wali of Asir which strictly speaking only includes the tribes of Bari Malik, 'Alqaga, Rufaidhat-al- Yemen, and Bani Mughaid, who are all descended from Qahtan, but is used loosely to include aJl the tribes from Wada'a to Zahran. In practice he only rules those tribes who recognize Turkish authority. The Turks, as is their custom with local chiefs whom they wish to keep in good humour, have made him a Bey. His own house is divided ! against him, for while his cousins Nasir and Muhammad Ibn 'Abdur Rahman support ' him and occupy positions under the Turks, the rest cf his family, including his brother'ASlR Ah, a young mail of 20, have Idrissi sympathies and refuse to countenance the Govern- Tuu XT -?; mi ki i V ?

'Abdullah Ibn Mufurrih is their chief, a man of 45, who holds the title of Bey from the Turks, and on account of his large estate and hn landed property in Abha, is outwardly on good terms with them out secretly in communication with the Idrissi. Of the Al Abu Sarah, whose head.-quarters are at Dhohya, just to the north of Sija All Ibn Lahik and his son Husain were formerly with the Turks but have seceded and allied themselves with the Aulad Ibn Mufurrih. Muhammad Abu Dusa has loner been a noted opponent of the Turks. 0 The Al Najih ar0 ju^t to the west of Abha and are divided in their sympathy. Their fehaikh, Yahya Ibn Salim, was taken captive and imprisoned by the Idrissi five vears ago for refusing to pay taxes to him. The Al al Wa ; zi live near the 'Alqam-al-Hul boundary, and are especially noted for their bravery, which has earned their nickname of Turk-al-Arab. They are all pro-Turk. The Al Am Sharaf are all settled along the Al Sirhan (Shahran) boundary and are •entirely out of hand, being at open enmity with the Turks and all their r. eighbours, as well as their own tribe. Their country is the focus of all the theives and highwaymen of the district, and they continually hold up the roads and rob innocent travellers. Thev also go up to the Wadi Tayya in the Kabi'ah-wa-Rufaidhah district, and help the Al Harith ^ M -J r wa,r a S aillst society. The most notorious amongst them are 'Abdullah Ibn Mif- dhil, JSTasir and Musa Ibn Sharain, and Gharam Ibn Rabih. The Al Am Jaraial and Al Am Wadi Mala are both settled in and round Abha, and are with the Government. The Al Waiman, a small section of 400 men who live near the Rabi'ah border to the south, are under the influence of the Idrissi. The Bani Mughaid are not a quarrelsome race and live at peace with all their neighbours, except the Rija-l-al-Ma', with whom they have a hereditary feud. Ihey take a considerable part in the local government, occupying many of the smaller posts, such as clerkships and the like, ajid a few have been chosen to represent Asir in the Ottoman Parliament. Amongst these are Ahmad Ibn Am Shiba of the Al Am Mufurrih, a man of 50, fat, dark, and of average height. He is a eloquent speaker, a Keen politician, and very pro-Turk with a strong hatred of the Sada, When at Abha he sits in the Majlis Baladi. He is a rich landowner, but is unpopular cn account of his meanness. 'Ali Ibn Khanfur is another deputy, and belongs to the Al Am Wadi Mala. He belongs to a middle-class family, his people being traders in hides in a small way. He used to be Bashkatib of accounts in Abha, having worked his way up from a small clerkship. He is a small man of about 40, his face being pitted with small-pox. He is very intelligent, and used to be religious, but has latterly taken to drink. He is not liked by the tribe. Muhammad Ibn 'Aziz, of the Al Am Manadhir, is another man of importance. He married a sister of Husain Eff. Walad Muzaika Julas, a deputy for Asir and the finance Minister (Sanduk Amini), and is accustomed to act for the latter during his absence abroad. He is also responsible for assessing the taxes in all the Turkish 18 ncs. A man of 25 years of age, small and dark, he is clever and has a good reputation. His brother, Mansur Ibn 'Aziz, was sent to Constantinope three years ap to represent certain grievances of the people of Abha, and succeeded in securing the dismissal of several Turkish officials.5 ASlR 2S7 fight to tax them, and he does not press the point. The Munjahah, however, all pay him taxes. Shaikh Hasan Fasikh being deputed to collect them. The nomads are fairly well off in sheep and camels. They are fishermen and sell dried fish in the interior. They also export dom nuts to Massowa. Their reputation is very evil and even their guests sleep with their rifles by their sides. Their soleumn oath has no meaning for them and they are notorious for their treachery. Before the Idrissi reduced them to order they were slave-dealers and kidnappers, highwaymen and sea pirates, and used to raid right up to Muhail and Baraq. They do not dare ndw to commit more than an occasional robbery or murder, for the Idrissi's police are always stationed in their country and punish severely any attempt to return to the old way of living. They are disliked by all the surrounding tribes, but in ordinary times they wander out of their country to the Bahr Ibn Sukaina and Bani Hilal. They do not go south of Shuqaiq at all, having no wish to come into closer contract with the Idrissi than is neces sary. Their chief Shaikh, 'Ali Ibn Fai, is a man of 45 years old, and helps the Idrksi to maintain law and order. His house is in Wasm, where he owes considerable property. He has seen much fighting and always leads his tribe in battle. Chief Shaikh ; 'Ali Ibn Fai. 6,000 men. (a) Settled. 1,000 men. Chief villages are ;— Al-Qahma 'Aidh Ibn ? Isa.

MUSA (A l)— The Al Musa own the town of Muhail and the country round Within a radius of from 6 to 10 miles. They are mostly settled, but the clans of Am Jirban and Bani Yazid are nomad. The tnbe is a mixed one, the nomads and a few of the townsmen being of pure Arab blood, the rest being blacks, originally of some African strain. Ko doubt they were at one time slaves, but they have long since earned their emancipation by their courage, and are now on an equality with the Arab portion of the tribe, although no intermarriage takes place. The tribe is fairly rich in flocks and herds, and although their country, which stands comparatively low, cannot rival the fertility of the highlands it nevertheless produces good crops in the rainy seasons. The enmity between the Turks and Idrissi has disorganized the tribe, and divided it into two opposing factions. Shaikh Sulaiman Ibn 'Ali, who is by right of inheritance the paramount chief, has thrown in his lot with the Turks, and has behind him the Jirban and about half the villagers. The remainder have broken loose under the leadership of Dhahir Ibn Shar and manv of them have retired to live at Janna in the Bahr Ibn Sukaina country, refusing to live at Muhail so long as there is a Turkish post there. From Janna they carry on a guerilla warfare, closing the roads and cutting off Turkish conveys whenever they can The tribe is bounded on the north by the Al-ad-Duraib and Raish, on the east by the Ra 1 sh and Bani Thuwwa, on the south by the Bani Thuwwa and Eahr Ibn Sukaina and on the west by the Bani Hilal. Against the Bani Hilal and Bani Thuwwa the whole tribe h as kfda feud for many generations.

There are two nomad Arab offshoots of the tribe called Bani Shib and Sawalaha, who ^occupy a small portion of the Sikkat-al-Halawiyah near Kiad, about 20 miles from Hali. They are of no political importance, and being separated from the rest of the tribe by -the wild Bani Hilal country, do not maintain very close relations with it.

They possess small herds of camels and goats but, although numerous, are of little political importance, -since they are poor fighters and there is little cohesion amongst their clans. They earn their living chiefly by selling milk and samn in Sabya. Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Musa'i is their chief. The tribe pays taxes regularly to the Idrissi. Chief subdivisions are the Bani Muhammad (not connected with the Bani Muhammad further south), Al-Hajowi or Haju, and Bani Mufurih. ^QAHTAN— The Qahtan of 'Asir are the 'Abidah, Bani Bishr, Rufaidhat-al-Yemen, Sanhan-al- Hibab, Sharaif and Wad a'ah. They are known in Asir generically as the Qahtan, and Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Dhulaim of the Sharaif is Amir over them all by appointment of the Idrissi, as was his, father by appointment of the Turks, but they are in fact six separate tribes, each living within its own boundaries, having its own particular ambi tions, its special likes and dislikes, its peculiar customs, and forming by itself a completely independent unit. Part of the Rufaidhat-al-Yemen are under Turkish influence.^ASlR 259 It is only in times of great crisis, as when the Shahran rose in a body against them about a hundred years age, that they answer to the call of their common blood, or' nowadays when the Idrissi calls on them to rally to his standard under their tribal leader. In normal times some are at enmity with others, and although Shaikh Muhammad Dhulaim ma}* be called in to settle tribal disputes and is responsible to the Idrissi for their good order, he has nothing to do with their tribal administration. They are in fact a loose confederation, who will only combine for defence in face of a danger which threatens to extinguish all, and for offence at the bidding of the Idrissi. On this account they are dealt with one by one, but are grouped together under the heading of Qahtan for convenience of reference. They are far too removed from the northern Qahtan to keep in touch with them, and never go near their country. Sometimes in times of drought a few of the former come down south and are always well received, but the connexion ends at that. The southern Qahtan tribes are for the most part, and with the exception of certairt nomad sub-tribes, well conducted and prosperous, and interested in trade or agriculture. The different sections vary considerably in military skill and few of them appear to have inherited the characteristics which have earned for their northern relations such air- unsavoury reputation. 1. 'AbIdah— The 'Abidah appear to be the bravest as well as the most prosperous and enterprising' section of the Qahtan. Their boundary in the south, where they have their villages, is well defined, but to the north their nomads wander over a vast stretch of country, and for almost 150 miles their western boundary adjoins that cf the Shahran. To the east lies Tathlith and the Yam tribes, to the south the Bani Bishr, and to the south-west the Kufaidhat-al-Yemen. The 'Abidah will follow Muhammad Ibn Dhulaim in battle, but they do not like the Sharaif in normal times, and look to their own chief Shaikh, Sa'ad Ibn Sulaim, in tribal matters. The latter is a man of about 40, and lives at Khamis 'Abidah, the principal village and market-place of the tribe. He is a rich man, and owns a large estate, and is much liked by his tribesmen, both for his justice and fairness and because he always is in the forefront of every fight. His sister married one of the sons of 'Abdul 'Aziz, Mushait, chief of the Shahran, about 20 years ago, and a truce was made between the two tribes. Shortly alterwards he had the misfortune to kill another of 'Abdul 'Aziz's- sons in a petty tribal dispute, and war again broke out and continued until the Idr pacified the country. There is still a bitter hatred between the two, which shows itself in periodical outbreaks. So deep is the enmity that in the case of a murder of an 'Abi dah by a Shahran no question of blood money is entertained, and the murdered man's' 1 relations do not rest until they have killed a Shahran in return. Shaikh Sa'ad Ibn Sulaim was formerly with the Turks, but he joined the Idrissi in his first revolt and has been one of his most faithful followers ever since. The Idrissi has a representative at Khamis 'Abidah, who collects taxes from all the tribe. The 'Abidah engage largely in trading, and buy up much of the coffee which comes from the district round Jabal Razah through Wada'a, subsequently selling it through out Asir. Some of them live permanently in Rijal, Abha, and Namas, and others are engaged in the Jiddah trade. They are a very industrious race, always on the look out for making money, and their villages are numerous and well built. They also specialize as masons and ply their trade throughout Asir. Th'ey do not agree with the Sharaif or Bani Bishar in peace time, but are friendly with the Rufaidhat-al-Yemen and Sanhan-al-Hibab. Unlike a great many tribes, the ' Aqidah are entirely united and the nomads are guided in their policy by the villagers. They are rich in dark-haired camels and black sheep, and take great pride in their pedigree horses. They will sell their poorer animals in the market, but they take great care of their finer beasts, feeding them on milk and only parting with them on special occasions, such as when they make a present to the Idrissi. The A1 Hamdan and Al-Hurjan, who number about 3,000 men and 2,000 mem respectively, are the two largest sections of the nomads. They come down to Khamis 'Abidah for the harvest and afterwards go up to Bishah with the other - nomads for the date season. They also wander out to Tathlith, where they meet other Qahtan Arabs 2l2 * r260 'ASlR and those of the Yam tribes, and where are to be found succulent grasses on which to fatten their herds. Their country abounds in gum, which they collect and sell in Khamis 'Ab'dah. In war they fight on camels or horses, and carry rifles, lances, and long curved Janabih. For a long time the A1 Has Rishaid and A1 Ghamar of the Shahran used to pay them money in order to escape being raided, but Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz Ibn Mushait refused to countenance this. They are always at odds with the northern nomads of the Shahran, and sometimes cut across and raid the BIshah-Abha road round Bir Abu Sarar. The 'Abidah do not seem to have inherited the bad qualities of the northern Qahtan. The whole tribe has a reputation for hospitality, and the nomads, though wild and rough, are not reckoned treacherous. Paramount Shaikh: Sa'ad Ibn Sulaim, (а) Settled. 6,000 men.

Their country is barren in the east, but productive and well forested near the sea, The adjoining tribes are 'Ab T dah on the north. Yam, Sharaif, and Sanhan-ftl-Hibab on the east, Bani Juma'ah On the south, and the Naj'u and Rufaidhat-al-Yemen on the west. The tribe numbers about 1,000 settled men and 3,000 nomads. 'Abdul-Hadi is the chief Shaikh, but his influence over the nomads is only nominal. He deserted the Turks some years ago, and all the tribes pay taxes to the Idrissi now. The settled portion is hospitable and prosperous, the nomads wild and intractable, almost without religion and with no marriage laws. They roam chiefly about the Tihamah and are rich in a breed of large black sheep. The tribe is friendly with the 'Abidah and Rufaidhat-al-Yfemen and generally at odds with the Naj'u, San- han, and Yami Chief Shaikh i ^bdul-Hadi. 4,000 men. (a) Settled* 1,000 men.

R ufaidhat-al-yemen^ The Rufaidhat-al-Yemen is a large tribe, numbering some 15,000 men, to the south-east of Abha, extending up the main mountain ridge and on to the plateau to beyond the source of the Wadi Shahran. The tribe is divided into four main divisions, the Al-al-Jihal, Bishat Ibn Salim, Bani Qais, and Sha'af Yarima-wa-Khutab. The chief Shaikh over all the tribe is Husain Ibn Haif, a man of 40 who live at Mudhik' Where he is a large and prosperous landowner. His father was a mudir under the Turks and died in the Ghamid country fighting for them, but Husain Ibn Haif joined the Idrissi when he first revolted, and fought for him in 1910. His tribe shares his dislike of the Turks and respect and obey him. The Al-al-Jihal have for generations been separated from the rest of the tribe, and lived a few miles to the west with the Sha'af Rashha and A1 Sirhan sections of the Shah- ran. They have not, however, intermarried with the latter, and are obedient to Husain Ibn Haif, although they do not join in any of the'quarrels which constantly occur between their own tribe and their hereditary enemies the Shahran. They are strongly in favour of the Idrissi and have fought for him on several occasions. The chief of the Bishat Ibn Salim is Muhammad Ibn 'Ali Walad 'Ali Ibn Murai'i; a shifty and cowardly man of about 45, who support the Turks and is paid by them! This section pays taxes to the Government. The Bani Qais lie to the east of the Bishat Ibn Salim, and also pay taxes to the Turks. Their Shaikh, Abu Salam, is now and old man of 75 and deaf. He has always had the reputation of siding with the strongest party. The nomad portion of this section, the Al-ash-Shuwat, are independent of him and the Turks. The Sha'af Yarima wa Khutab who live to the south are likewise free, and the alle* giance which they pay to the Idrissi is only nominal. They are a wild and suspicious people, and though they have no objection to entertaining guests, they will not suffer them to sleep in their tents. The country of the Rufaidhat-al-Ymen is for the most part fertile and densely wooded on the slopes of the hills, and the tribe is a prosperous one. They are not noted for their martial ardour, though the A1 El Jihal and the nomads can fight well. They are nick* named by the other tribes the Muhaniatin-al-Murra, owing to their habit of staining their women with henna. ® All that portion of the tribe which is against the Turks recognize the overlordship of Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Dhulaim of the Sharai. The sister of Husain Ibn Haif is married to Shaikh Muhammad, and the two chiefs are close friends* Paramount Shaikh ; Husain Ibn Haif. 15,000 men. (ct) Al-ah Jihal. 4,000 men. Muhammad Ibn Shuwail.

Bishr and Yam, on the east by the Yam, on the south by the Sanhan-al-Hibab, and on the west by the Bani Bishr. Their country is flat and treeless, and most of their cultivation is from well water. They are traders rather than agriculturists, and are well conducted and unwarlike. Their numbers does not exceed 800 men, of whom a quarter are nomads. They are chiefly known on account of their leader, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Dhulaim. His father Dhulaim Ibn Sha'r, who died about 16 years ago, was a famous man in 'Asir, and for many years was the Mudir of £ll Qahtan tribes. His headquarters were at Haraja in Sharaif country, where there was also a Turkish garrison. Muhammad Ibn Dhulaim succeeded him at a monthly salary of £25, but seceded to the Idrissi when the latter raised his standard of revolt. The Turks thereupon sent an expedition against him and burnt his fortress in Haraja but were ultimately forced to retire and have not penetrated to his country since. The Idrissi made him one of his Muqdamis or generals, and he was in command of the Qahtan tribes in the fighting against the Turks and the Sharif of Mecca in 1910. Afterwards he and Saiyid Arar Ibn Nasir led the Idrissi's army against the Imam's forces under Muhammad Abu Nuwaiba, in the Sahar country, about three years ago. He is still a young man about 35 years of age, rich according to the standards of the country and with an excellent reputation both as a leader in war and a tribal administrator.

Wada'ah— Or Wada'ah; a small mercantile tribe living in the district of the same name near the Yam tribes of Najran. They are bounded on the north and east by the Yam and on the west by the Sanhan-al-Hibab. Their country is not naturally productive, but they have a large number of wells and grow grapes which they convert into raisins and sell as far as Abha and Rijal. They import coffee from Jabal Rasih and Khaulan-ash- Sham and sell it in 'Asir or to the merchants of Rufaidhat-al-Yemen. They are generally on bad terms with the Yam tribes, but are not quarrelsome or pugnacious. The Idrissi has his police and tax-gatherers amongst them, as he has among the other Qahtan tribes. 'Ali Rukwan, their chief Shaikh, goes on pilgrimage nearly every year and acts as Amir-al-Hajj for all the southern Qahtan tribes. Chief Shiakh :'Ali Ibn Rukwan ; 600 men. Chief villages :— Dhahran. Al-Baidha. Safwan. Al-Irj-Wada'ah. QARN (B ul)— The Bul Qarn are divided into the Bul Qarn-as-Sirat and the Bul Qarn-al-Yemen,' and stretch in a south-westerly direction from near Bishah across the tangled mass of264 'ASIR mduntains which form tho backbone of the 'Aslri range, and down towards the seaward 8lopes 4 They are bounded on the north by the Shumran and Khatham, on the east by the Shahran and nomads of the Bani Shihr, on the south by the Bani 'Amr and Bani Shihr, and on the west by the Bui 'Uryan and Ghamid. The Bui Qarn-as-Sirat are two-thirds settled and one-third nomad, the Shaikh over all being Mashaa'd Ibn Bahran, who lives at Al-Alayah, a large village about eight hours west of Qal'at Blshah. He is rich a landowner and also possesses date- groves in Bishah. The country appears to be fertile and well wooded, and supports large herds of camels, goats, and cattle. The nomads draw into the cultivation during its season, and when it has been harvested take flour to Bishah, which they exchange for dates. There is a general truce with the Shahran amongst all the tribes during the date season at Bishah, which lasts about four months. At other times the Bui Qarn are at feud with the Shahran, Bani Shihr, Ghamid, and Shumran. They are friendly to the Khatham and Bani 'Amr. The Bui Qarn-al-Yamen occupy the lowland district of 'Urdia and are wholly given up to farming. Their chief Shaikh is Mijarri Ibn Sa'id. The two sections of the tribe are friendly and help each other in war. They are not remarkable for their courage, but can render a good account of themselves. In politics they all avour the Idrissi and pay him taxes. They are ^hospitable in character, and passage through their country, is generally safei A. Bui Qarn-as-Sirat [or ash-Sham). 6,000 men.

RABI'AH MUQATRAH— Often pronounced Mujatrah ; the Rabi'ah Muqatrah are a wild nomad tribe number ing aboiit 5,000 men. The Baraq-Qunfudah road runs through the middle of their territory for about 20 miles between the villages of Ghar-al-Hindi and Juma'at Rabi'ah. They are bounded on the north by the Bani Shihr, on the east by the Humaidah, on the south by the Rabl'at-at-Tahahin, and on the west by the Bui' Air. They are said to be fairer of face than most Arabs, with blue eyes, and to wear their hair well down over the shoulders. They are almost pagan, and at odds with all the world except the Rabl'at-at-Tahahin, who are as savage as themselves. The Idrissi sometimes suc ceeds in levying taxes on them, but his influence is only nominal. Passage through their country is dangerous both to the Turks and ordinary wayfarers. They are rich in camels and cattle. A small clan of the A1 Ikhlaif section of the Al-ad-Duraib lives in the north-east cbrner of this tribal district with the consent of the Rabi'ah Muqatrah,'ASlR 265 RABl'AH-WA-RUrAIDHAH— The Rabl'ah-wa-Rufaidhah stretch from a few miles north-north-west of Abha to within about 15 miles of Muhail, their country being about 35 miles from north to south, and 20 miles from east to west on the average, though it tapers to a point in the north. The tribes which adjoin them are: on the north the Ar-Raish, on the east the Bui Ahmar and Bani Malik, on the south the 'Alqam-al-Hul, and on the west the Rijal-al- Ma' and Bani Thuwwa, The tribe is divided into four main divisions, the Rabi'at- ash-Sham, A1'AsTmat, Rufaidhat-ash-Sham and A1 Harith. The Rabi'at-ash Sham and Rufaidhat-ash-Sham have no relationship or connection with the Rabi'at-al-Yemen and Rufaidhat-al-Yemen as might be supposed. The Rabi'at-ash-Sham occupy the southern portion of the territory, being entirely settled in villages along the Abha-Athalif road. They have no Chief Shaikh, having expelled 'Aidh Ibn Hasan, their former Shaikh; on account of his desertion to the Turks. The A1 'Asimat are partly settled and partly nomad, chiefly along the Bani Thuwwa boundary. Their Chief Shaikh, 'Ali Ibn Hamud, fought for the Idrissi in 1910, was captured by the Turks, and after a year's imprisonment was released and reinstated. The A1 Harith who are both settled and nomad, live in the Wadi Tayya, along which is the main road from Abha to Muhail, and for years have given a great deal of trouble to the Government. The Wadi Tayya is the headquarters of all the bad characters in the neighbouring country, an d a caravan has to be very strong to pass through without paying toll. The A1 Harith are notoriously treacherous and their hand is against the whole world, including their own tribe. They engage in the camel-carrying trade to a certain extent between Muhail and the Rijal-al-Ma', but they seldom venture near Abha, nor can the Turks levy taxes from them, as they sometimes do from the rest of the tribe. Their Shaikh, Muhammad Ibn Shahir, has a very bad reputation. The tribe as a whole favours the Idrissi, chiefly because it is discontented with the Government. It is, however, notoriously fickle and unreliable, and goes with the side which pays it best.

EABrAT-AT-TAHAHIN— The Rab 'at-at-Tahahin hold the country on either side of the Sikkat-al-Halawylah (Muhail-Qunfudah road) between the villages of Ma'mal Al Ikhlaif and Markh, a distance of about 30 miles. They are bounded on the west by the Bui 'Air, on the north by the Rabl'ah Muqatrah and Humaidah, on the east by the Al Jabali and Al-ad-Duraib, and on the south by the Bani Hilll and the Hali tribes. Their country is mountaneous and well wooded, and they are rich in camels, goats, and cattle. About 2,000 in number of fighting men, they are entirely nomad, despise all forms of husbandry, and are a terror to travellers on the road. They are allied with the Rabl'ah Muqatrah and Al-ad-Duraib and generally on fair terms with the Hali tribes. With the Bmi Hilal, Bui 'Air, Hamaidah, and Al Jabali, they keep up incessant feuds. The Turks have never been able to do anything with them, but the Idrissi is able to tax them to a certain extent, and what outside sym pathies they have are for him. RABl' AT-AL-YEMEN— The Rabi'at-al-Yemen are a nomadic tribe keeping chiefly to Wadi Dhula and Wadi Shala, and sometimes going down to Shuqaiq or up to the Bani Mughaid country. The adjoining tribes are the Bani Mughaid on the north and north-east, the Shahran on the south-east, the Bani Shi'ba and other nomads of Mikhlaf-al-Yemen on the south, and the Rijal-al-Ma, on the west. They are rich in camels, donkeys, and flocks, and make a good living by selling samn in Abha. They are well armed with the type of French rifle which they call ' Abu Bukra ', and carry shields, as well as long curved knives (Jenabih). They are noted for their bravery and deem it a distgrace to die in their beds. Though wild and rough and with such a contempt for marriage that as a rule they have to be known by the names of their mothers, they are nevertheless hospitable, and clean in their fighting, and have the reputation of never going back on their word once given. In perSOna they are very tall and fairer than most Arabs, with blue eyes. They say they'ASIR 267 are descended from Ashraf-al-Husaimyah, but their enemies call them Saiuba. They pay but little attention to religion, and on the first day of Ramadhan choose thirty young men, whom they dress in white and compel to fast for one day at some appointed place, on behalf of the whole tribe. Having dCme this they have a feast, and taunt the neighbouring nomads for their inability to rise to such heights of self- sacrifice. They are a united and conservative tribe, condemning those who smoke, and out of contempt for foreign luxuries, eating only milk and meat. They live in straw-plaited tents. Their friends are the Bani Mughaid: their enemies, the Rijal-al-Ma', Shahran, Bani Shi'ba and Naju'. The Turks have never been able to keep them in order, and their attitude to the Idrissi depends entirely on his power to make them obey. 'Ali Ibn Jabbar is their chief Shaikh, a man of 45 and a noted warrior. He is said to have the tribe well in hand: he pays a nominal allegiance to the Idrissi, but will not allow him to collect taxes. {Auldd-Al Am Husairi), Chief Shaikh : 'Ali Ibn Jabbar.

RAISH (Ar).— The Ar-Raish are to the north and north-east of Muhail, and are bounded on the north by the Al Musa Ibn 'Ali and the Shahari section of the Bani Shihir, on the east by the Bui Asmar, on the south by the Bani Thuwwa and Al Musa, and on the west by the Al-ad-Duraib. Their southern boundary comes to within 5 miles of Muhail. They are divided into two sections of Ar-Raish and Al-Mashwal, and number about 2,500 men. But although fairly numerous, they are cowardly and unwarlike, and are classed in contempt with the Bani Malik, by the fighting tribes and round. They all favour the Idrissi and pay him taxes. They tried to make a stand in 1912 against the Sharif of Mecca, but were badly worsted and their country laid waste. They are entirely sedentary and engaged in farming. The country is farily level, thickly wooded and productive, with running streams in places. Their enemies are Bui Asmar Bani Shihir, and Bui Ahmar ; their allies, the Baraq tribes, the Al Musa, Bani Thuwwa' and the Bani Qutaba and Bani Dhalim of the Rijal-al-Ma'. An isolated colony own the village of Mandar in the Bui Asmar, country and hold aloof from any hostilities which take place between the two tribes.

Madba'. Sakkan-al-Raish. BIJAL-AL-MA.' The Rijal-al-Ma 7 , though not so numerous as some of the 'Asir tribes—it can at most put 1,700 men in the field—is nevertheless one of the most renowred for its courage and dash in war, its internal unity, and its pride of independence. Its country lies between Abha and the sea, and is roughly a stretch of 50 miles from north-west to south east, and 25 miles from north-east to south-west. Its neighbours are the Bahr Ibn Sukaina and Bani Thuwwa on the north, Kabi'ah-wa-Rufaidhah, 'Alqam, Bani Mughaid and Rabi'at-al-Yemen on the east, Ben Shi'ba on the south, and Munjahah and Bani Hilal on the west. The tribe is divided into seven sub-divisions : the Bani Qutaba, Bani Dhalim-al- Hashir, Bani Juna, Qais (or Jais) Ibn Mas'udi, Bani Zaidin, Shahab, and Am Bina. The chief Shaikh of the whole tribe is Ibrahim Ibn Mita'ali of Julia, a man much respected for his prowess in war and his wisdom in tribal matters. He is now over 70 years in war of age, and for some time most of the administration has devolved on his son, Ahmad Ibn Mita'ali. The latter is a tall man of about 30, with a fair skin, who first made his name as a fighter when the Rijal-al-Ma' overran Mikhlaf-al-Yemen just before the rise of the Idrissi. He fought the Sharif in 1910 at Muhail and in the Bui Ahmar country, but withdrew his forces at a critical moment owing to the appoint ment of Saiyid Mustafa, of the Bahr Ibn Sukaina, as general of the whole 'Asir army&lt; So greatly did the Rijal-al-Ma' resent having an outsider placed over them, that soon after one of their minor Shaikhs^ Saiyid Yahya Walad-ash-Shairi, with the full approval of the tribe, attempted to murder him. The Idrissi gave way on the matter, but the mischief had been done, and the Rijal-al-Ma' took no further part in the campaign. Of the sub-tribes, the Bani Qutaba live in the fertile valley of Wadi El- 'Us which rises near Suda, and joining the Wadi-al-Ahabash near Athalif, eventually flows into the Wadi Do a by Muhail. The Bani Qutaba stretch from near its source to beyond Athalif in a succession of villages surrounded by cultivation The slopes of the hills and the valleys, except where cleared, are here, as elsewhere in the Rijal-al-Ma' country, deeply forested. The Bani Qutaba, though dwelUng in villages, are of a wandering temperament, and are the chief camel carriers on all the trade routes of 'Asir, going to Sabya, Qunfidah, Birk, and sometimes as far as Bishah and Mecca. Living with them is a small colony of 'Abadlah Ashraf, who wield a certain amount of influence. The Shaikh of Athalif, Ibrahim-al-Hufd hi, is a man of some notoriety. His father was made a Qaimmaqam by the Turks, and granted a pension of £15 a month, which wa^ paid to his family until the tribe revolted^ Ibrahim-al-Hufd hi went to Constantinople in 1914 to assert his loyalty to the Turks and ask that the pension should continue to be paid to hiim His influence in the tribe is Sot great. The Bani Dhalim lie to the south of the Wadi-a 1 - 'Us and are entirely settled. They are the large section, numbering 4,000 men, and also by far the richest. They have most of the trade of 'Asir in their hands and bring petroleum, sugar, tea, clothing, etc., from Aden and Massawah, which they sell chiefly in the large village of RijaL They have been the foremost pioneers in the importation of fire-arms from Jibuti, which has increased so largely during the last few years and which the Turks have found it impossible to check. Rijal is the focus of all local products and skins ; gum and samn are brought from as far as the Shahran country, bought by the Bani Dhalim merchants, and exported to Aden. The village next in importance is Shaibain,the chief rifle market. The Rijal-Al-Ma' never marry outside their own country, but as they have grown rich, they have bought much land in the neighbouring districts of 'Alqam-al-Hul and Rabi'at-al-Yemen. Amongst the most wealthy of them is a family of Saiyids, known as the Sada-an-Na'amiyah, who have lived amongst them for many generations, and Shaikh; Ali Ibn Tali'. Muhammad Abu Alama, Sahfan. Ibn Salama.'ASIR 269 whose head, Saiyid Husain-an-Na'amiyah, is the most important leader in war after Ahmad-al-Mita'ali and Ahmad-al-Hayyani. The Bani Juna are partly settled in villages and partly nomad, and inhabit the country towards the Munjahah. They, too, engage in trade to a certain extent, and one of their Shaikhs, Ayuh, was the first man to start the gun-running venture. The village of Jabut was the chief centre, and received its name from Jibuti. They are also occupied with home industries, and both men and women are employed in making straw woven articles, such as matting, baskets and hats, which they call ' Toffush,' and which are largely worn by the women of Asir. The most important man of the Bani Dhalim and one of the best known in Asir is Zain-Al-'Abdin, chief Mufti of 'Asir, and greatly trusted by the Idrisi. Educated at Zabid, he had already become a force in 'Asir before the rise of the Idrissi, by reason of his learning and the justice of his decisions. He now has powers of life and death, and is the chief judge of appeals from the judgements of the tribal Qadhis and Muftis wherever the power of the Idrissi runs. He is also frequently called in to arbitrate in the more important tribal disputes, and as the Rijal-al-Ma' have implicit confidence in him and are willing to back it by force of arms, his influence is very great. He is now a man of about 40 years of age, and has houses in Sabya and Rijal. The Jais Ibn Mas'udi live near the 'Alqam-al-Hul border and are the aristocrats of the tribe. The paramount family belongs to them, and they consider it beneath their dignity to engage in trade of any sort. They live for fighting alone, and have as high a reputation for courage as any tribe in the country. Their integrity, too, is unchalleng ed, and in most of the tribal disputes in neighbouring friendly tribes they are called in to arbitrate. In the south are the Bani Zaidin along the Bani Mughaid and Bani Shi'ba bcundaries. They, too, are noted fighters-. They grow much coffee on the slopes of the hills and their nomad clans are rich in flocks. Their chief Shaikh is Ahmad-al-Hayyani, who lives at Hiswa. He is a man of about 45, and after Ahmad Ibn Mita'ali, he is the most important man in the tribe. An enemy of the Turks since childhood, he eagerly support ed the Idrissi, and is said to have almost as much influence with him as Muhammad Yahya Basahi. He is a great friend of Saiyid Mustafa, and keeps on good, though at times jealous, terms with Ahmad Ibn Mita'ali. The Shahab and Am Bina share the country in the Wadi-al-Ahabash to the north* They are entirely agricultural and pastoral, and seldom leave their borders except to fight. The Rijal-al-Ma' are foes with the Bani Hilal, Bani Mughaid, Rabi'ah-wa-Rufaidhah, A1 Musa, and Munjahah. With the Bani Thuwwa, 'Alqam, and Bani Shi'ba they are allies. They were once good friends of the Bahr Ibn Sukaina, but relations have been strained since the Saiyid Mustafa episode. Before the Idrissi arose, they were under the domina tion of the Turks, but since his revolt they have entirely thrown off their yoke. During the Jast few years, the road to Muhail from Abha, via Athalif, has been closed to the Turks, and frequent dashes are made to the main Muhail-Abha road when news is received that a Turkish convoy is passing through. They support the Idrissi as equals, rather than as subjects, and will neither consent to pay him taxes nor suffer his officers to n^e them. They have a code of justice amongst themselves which is fairly rough and ready, but is rigidly enforced. Murder is severely punished, sometimes by death sometimes by the payment of blood-money; theft, after two warnings and when proved by witnesses on oath, by the loss of a hand. There is a fixed dowry, both for rich and poor of P 120, and plurality of wives is the exception. There is a strong feeling against divorce without adequate reason. A man is considered justified in taking a second wife, if the first fails to bear him children, but such a fuilure is not a sufficient excuse for a divorce.

SABYA (A hl)— The term Ahl Sabya is vaguely used in Asir to include both the people of Sabya itself and the villages round within a considerable radius. They are in no sense a tribe, and should therefore properly be excluded from this handbook, but as mention of them is sometimes made in reports, and the are closely connected with the Idrissi, whose head quarters are at Sabya, a brief description is included. Before the Idrissi's rise to power these villages were a succession of small independent units, each a law to itself and generally at odds with its r^eighbour. The Turks never attempted a proper adminis tration of the country, and violence was rife to such a degree that only large armed parties could travel with safety. Only when the hillsmen descended on them was there any degree of cohesion, an,d in the last attack of the Rijal-al-Ma', which took place about 1913, the villagers all combined to save their homes. The first task of the Idrissi was to conciliate the different warring elements and to promote peace, and to-day the district is thoroughly under control and law abiding. The largest element of the population is of Sudanese blood, partly unemancipated slaves, but chiefly those who have gained their freedom. With these are the Mowallads, Sudanese with an Arab strain, and over them the Arabs of pure blood and the Sa'ada272 ? ASlK and Ashraf. Sabya itself, of course, contains merchants from other Muhammadan countries, the strongest element coming from the Hadhramaut. Muhammad Yahya Basah, the chief adviser of the Idrissi, and the Amir of all Mikhlaf-al-Yemen, which of course includes Sabya, is from that country. The Idrissi's standing army of about 500 men is entirely recruited from amongst the Sudanese round Sabya, and they can muster about 10,000 men when the general rally is sounded. The following is a list of the chief villages and their approximate number of fighting men. S abya .

SHAHRAN— The Shahran cover a greater stretch of country than any other tribe in'Asir, and are the largest numerically. The country round Bishah is theirs and they follow the Wadi Shahran to its source and thence to within 20 miles of Sabya, a distance from north to south of more than 200 miles. Their boundary from east to west of the Wadi Shahran is undefined and constantly changing, as one or the other of the neighbouring nomad tribes gains the upper hand. Further south it is fixed and varies from 5 to 60 miles in breadth. Their neighbours on the north are the wandering Shalawa and Sabai', on the east the' Abidah and Rufaidhat-al-Yemen, on the south the Naji, and on the west, starting near the sea and working north, the Bani Shi'ba, Bani Mughaid, where they come to within four miles of Abha, Bani Malik, Bui Ahmar, Bui Asmar, Bani Shihr, Bui Qarn, and Shumran. The Shahran, like the Bani Shihr, Shumran, and other tribes of 'Asir, trace their descent to the Rijal-al-Hajar. The tribe is divided into nine main divisions, the A1 Mushait, A1 Rishaid, Al-al-Ghamar, Nahas, Kaud, Bani Bijad, Bani Wahab, Sha'af Rashha, and Al Yinfa. The Al Mushait are numerically the smallest, but politically the most important sub- tribe, since they contain the ruling tribal family. In former days its influence over the whole tribe was unquestioned, but since the Idrissi's rise to fame some sections haveHz 'ASlR 27S joined him, while others have remained faithful to the Turks, and discord has crept in and weakened its power. It is stiP, however, very powerful, and in purely tribal matters has the ultimate word over the majority. The paramount chief is 'Abdul Aziz Ibn Mushait, now an old man of 60, who lives in considerable stfite at Dahban, and also owns a house in Khamis-al-Mushait, the largest and most important trading centre in Asir. Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz is a rich man, since he levies his own taxes in this town, taking a piastre for every donkey sold., 2 piastres for each camel, and 6 piastres for a skin of samn, etc. The Turks do not interfere with him in this, but content themselves with taking ' ushur ' from the local cultivators. He is, however, expected to entertain freely members of the outlying sub-tribes who visit him, and always keeps an open house. In his old age he has taken to drink, and leaves all the active management of the tribe to his son, Saiyid Ibn 'Abd. The latter like his father supports the Turks, and is a friend of the Sharif of Mecca, but he is also said to correspond with the Idrissi. He is now about 32 years old, and is popular with the tribe and, as a leader, famous in war. The only other man of importance in the family is Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz's nephew, Sa'ad Ibn Husain, who has been won over by the Idrissi, with the promise of the chief Shaikhship if he can oust his uncle and cousin. His appointment, however, would not be popular with the tribes, for he is reputed to be mean and overbearing. His two brothers, 'Abd Ibn Ibrahim and Husain Ibn 'Abd, are with him but have not much influence. The A1 Rishaid live round Khamis Mushait and towards Abha and number about 4,000 men. 'Ali Ibn 'Itaij is their chief Shaikh, a fighter of repute. They all support the Turks but they refuse to pay them taxes, nor do they join the local gendarmerie. They are a prosperous community and the ir nomads are rich in a beed of large white sheep. They also own many horses. They have not a good reputa tion in war. The A1 Ghamar are braver than the A1 Rishaid and quarrel with them. They live along the Bani Malik boundary, and muster about 1,000 men, of whom 600 are nomads. Muhammad Ibn Urur, their chief Shaikh, dislikes Shaikh 'Abdul 'Az:z and supports the Idrissi. His followers, however, keep very much to their own country and do not meddle in politics. The Nahas are a purely nomad section and are rich in horses and sheep. They live out to the east along the 'AbTdah boundary, and are of all the Shahran the most famous in war. They do all their fighting on horseback, principally against the 'Afrdah. The Kaud and the A1 Rishaid pay them ' Khawa ' at the rate of 12 piastres for every well as a bribe against being plundered. They have no cultivation and live by selling samn and their animals in Khamis Mushait. Their young men are not permitted to wear rings until they have killed a man, and once blooded they cut a notch on the stock of their rifles for each of their victims. Utterly out of hand, they never approach Abha, and recognize neither the Turks nor the Idrissi nor their own paramount Shaikh. 'Aidh Ibn Jabar is their chief, a man of 50, who has led them into battle for years. The Kaud are entirely settled in Wadi Tindaha, which flows into the Wadi Shahran, and is the most fertile of all the Shahran country. They are peaceable and unwarl:ke and obedient to Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz. The Bani Bijad are a large section numbering 10,000 men, of whom 7,000 are nomads. The settled portion lives along the Abha-B:shah road between A1 Batat and Shafan, and is entirely agricultural. The nomads are warlike and fight both on horseback and on foot. Their cavalry carry lances as well as rifles. They are on bad terms with the Bani Wahab and fight the 'AbTdah, Bui Ahmar, and Bui Asmar. Like most nomads they go up to Blshah, for the date season. Saiyid Ibn Hashbal is chief over all the sub-tribe. He was formerly with the Turks, but now sides with the Idrissi, and only pays a nominal allegiance J to Shaikh 'Abdul 'Az'z. He collects tithes from his followers, with whom he is popular, and is a rich man. The Bani Wahab are the largest sub-tribe, numbering 15,000 men, of whom 13,000 are nomads.^ They live in the Wadi Shahran up to B:shah. Of all Arabs they have the most evil reputation. They are robbers and highwaymen, treacherous, even to their guests, have little religion and no marriage laws, and kill women and children in their raids custom which is execrated by all other fighting tribes. They are also unclean m their feeding and eat rats and jerboas. The man with the strongest hahd rules th0 P r03ent Shaikh, Nasir Ibn Haif, and Haif Ibn Nasir, his son, won their C52(w)GSB 2n274 'AS IK position by forcibly ejecting the former Shaikh, Ibn Hashal, who has now degenerated into a petty and uninfluential highwayman. They are against every tribe and every Government and are paid by other weaker bribes to refrain from raiding. The villagers of Bishah and the clans who live near, -such as the Rimathan, Uqlub, and Bani Sulail, are, however, slightly more civilized. Only during the date season at B shah, which lasts about four months, there is a general 'trace and Arabs from all over the country foregather. Shaikh 'Abdul 'Aziz owns large and valuable date groves and both the Sharif of Mecca and the Idrissi have agents there. These latter both belong to the Bani Wahab, Shaikh Yahya Ibn Faiz acting for the Sharif, and Nasir Kurkman for the Idrissi, for the purpose of collecting Zalcdt, The former is the more influential. The Bani Wahab go out to Tathlith at certain sea sons of the year, where there is excellent grazing for their many flocks and herds. The Sha'af Rashha and A1 Yinfa'a occupy the Tihamah to the south of Abha, from which they are separated by the Bani Mughaid. The Sha'af Rasha, who are to the north of the A1 Yinfa'a, are entirely settled and peaceful. The A1 Yinfa'a live in the ^district of Tamniah which is the most fertile of all Asir, and approach to within '20 miles of Sabya. They are numerous and wealthy and have a good reputation for hospitality and courage. 'Abdullah Ibn Hamadh is the chief Shaikh of both sections, -a tall man of about 55, with a long white beard.. He was formerly on the side of the Turks, but broke with tliem and with Shaikh 'Abdul 'Az'z about 8 years ago, when his son was murdered by the Bani Wahab, while a guest of Shaikh 'Abdul 'Az T z. Since then he has joined the Idrissi, and being a man of great influence, has brought his tribe with him. The Idrissi now collects taxes from them and keeps aboutlOO police at Tamniah. The enemies of these two sub-tribes are the Rufaidhat-al-Yemen and Rabi'ah: their friends, the Arabs of Mikhlaf-al-Yemen. The nomads of A1 Yinfa'a are horse owners and sell them in the Sabya market. ^(1) A l M ush ait.

They are chiefly merchants in the hide and samn trade with Massawah, which they often visit. 'Ali Ibn Mubhi is the chief Shaikh, a nominee of the Idrisi. The most important man, however, is Ibn 'Abbas, who was formerly Shaikh, but was imprisoned by the Idrisi for three years for conspiracy. He is now out on guarantee, and, being the biggest merchant and richest landowner in Shaqaiq is to be reckoned with.

Their Shaikhs and chief families are Arabs and trace their descent to Qahtan, but the majority of the tribe are Sundanese, who have been emancipated for many generations. They are excellent fighters, amenable to discipline, and are generally known as the 'Asakir (or soldiers). . They all support the Idrissi and pay him taxes. The Bani Shi'ba do not engage in trade, the villagers being agriculturists and the nomads possessing large herds of camels, cattle, and sheep. They also own horses and nearly always fight as cavalry. They are friendly with the Munjahah, Eijal-al-Ma', and'277 the Mikhlaf tribes, but are hereditary enemies of the Ribi'at-al-Yeme^ aiid generally on bad terms with the Bani Mughaid, whose country they avoid.

They are a tall and well-made race and their women are noted for their beauty. They inhabit the country from the Tihamah, 25 miles east of Qunfudah up the main mountain range and across tho watershed almost to Wadi Shahran. The tribes which adjoin them are, on the north, starting from the Tihamah, the Bui 'Uryan, Bui Qarn, Bani'Amr, on the east the Shahran, on the south the Bal Asmar, Raish, the Al Musa Ibn'Ali, the Humaidah and the Rabi'ah Muqatrah. On the west, where their boundary has narrowed to about 15 miles, are the Zubaid. Their territory is funnel-shaped, widening out as it goes inland, till it reaches the Shahran in the east, with whose boundary it marches for over 60 miles. The settled portion of the tribe have shown little sympathy with the Tdrissi, and are almost entirely pro-Sharif and Turk. They are divided into three main sections, the north, south and Tihamah, ruled over by different Shaikhs, who are usually on bad terms with each other, but unite against common enemies. The largest section and the most important politically is the Bani Shihr-ash-Sham 1 mu 0 i liV j chiefly alon S the Ab ha-Taif road, between 'Asabaili and Qurum, or Uqrum! The ieadmg family and one of the noblest of Asir, is that of Ibn Qurum, closely connected with Mecca, both by sympathy and relationship, Sharif Muhammad Ibn 'Abdul Mu'in mi. S ran dfath er of the present Sharif, having married into the family. The present head of the family is Sa'id Ibn Faiz, an old man now, with two sons, both born of a Cicassian mother, Faraj Bey Ibn Sa'id, who has been one of the Heiaz representatives in the Ottoman Parliament, and Faiz Ibn Sa'id. They all visit Constantinople and Mecca regularly, have a house in Abha, and have furnished their house at 'Asabaili in semi-European style, and having also adopted the western habit of smoking and drinking, are looked at with dislike and suspicion by other tribes. They are, however, large landowners and rich men and are a decided asset on the join the latter tlie eveilt of a split between the two, they would probably Faraj Bey Ibn Sa'id is a tall man of about 38, with a fair skin, which he gets from his mother.

SHUMRAN— The Shumran occupy a part of tho high upland country tlirough which runs the Abha-Taif road and extend down the slopes of the hills to the Tihamah. They are bounded on the west and north by the Ghamid, on the east by the Shahran' and on the south by the Khath'am and Bal Qarn. They are divided into the Shumran - ash-Sham, Shumran-at-Tihamah, and the nomads, each section Bumbering about 2 000 men. The northern Shumran and the nomads are under the Shaikhship of Hasan Ibn Matar, a young man of 30, who has a good reputation for wisdom in tribal matters and has made a name of for himself in war. Their chief centre is Al-Balus, the largest of a number of villages near the Khath'am border, set in a rich and well-wooded valley. The nomads, the Suhab, and A1 Mubarak wander down into the Tihamah in the winter or stay round Al-Balus, and in the summer go up with the Bui Qarn and other nomads to the Shahran country round Bishah for the date season. They own many sheep and goats, but few camels. The most important section of the Shumran-at-Tihamah is Al-'Ubus, under Shaikh 'Ishaq Ibn Muzallaf, whose chief village is Marwa'a. They have permanent vilWes in which they live during winter, but in summer most of them lead a nomadic life, living in straw-woven tents. The whole tribe unites in war, their chief enemies boma the Ghamid. They are also usually at odds with their weaker neighbour the Khath'am Their reputation as a fighting race is good, and they share with the Bui Qarn the custom of purifying themselves and wearing the finest clothes before going into battle In normal times, they are an hospitable and light-hearted race, ever ready to find an excuse for relaxation. Marriage festivals are celebrated on a much larger scale than is usual in 'Aslr. Their outside political leanings are -strongly in favour of the Idrisi against the Sharif of Mecca and the Turks.

THUWWA(B ani)— The Bani Thuwwa lie to the south of Muhail and are astride the main Abha-Muhai- road between Butuh and the Wadi Sha'b-al-Asla, a distance of 10 miles, and the Abha Athalif-Muhail road between Jabal Hoila and Huus Bani Thuwwa, a distance of 15 miles The territory between these roads is theirs, and their boundary on the north approaches within 5 miles of Muhail. Their neighbours on the north are the A1 Musa and Ar-Raish, on the east Bui Asmar on the south A1 Nahya and A1 Harith of the Rabi'ah-wa-Rufaidhah, and on the west the Bahr Ibn Sukaina. The tribe numbers some 2,000 men, of whom two-thirds are settled, the remainder A1 'Ubus 'Ishaq Ibn Muzallaf. nomad.280 'ASlR They are a bold and fearless tribe who live chiefly by raiding, and unpretected parties either of the Turks or ordinary travellers, are never safe while in their country. Thev have never submitted to Ottoman authority, and, since the rise of the Idrisi, have quite got out of hand. Their chief Shaikh, Shaikh Sarwi, is one of the most noted highway men of 'Aslr, and has given endless trouble to the Government. They are generallv at feud with the A1 Musa, Rabi'ah-wa-Rufaidhah and Bui Asmar, are still allied with the Rijal-al-Ma' and Bui Ahmar.

'URYAN (B ul)— The Bul 'Uryan, or ' Fathers of nakedness', have received their name from the poor and savage conditions under which they live. They appear to be mostly of African extraction and, save for a few miserable villages, they are nomads. Their exact bound aries have not been ascertained, but it is known that they have Ghamid on the north the Bul Qarn-at-Tihamah on their east, the Bani Shihr on their south, and the Zubaid on their west. They are divided into four sections, the Bal 'Uryan, Bani A'isa, Bani Sulaim and Bani Suhaim, and are said to number 6,000 men. In normal times thay quarrel amongst themselves, but unite when danger from outside threatens. They reckon all their neighbours as foes, but they have been known to help the Shamran against the Ghamid. The Beni A'isa pay a nominal allegiance to the Idrissi, which means that they help him in war if there is a prospect of loot, and in peace refuse to pay him taxes. The other sub-trjbe are completely independent and refuse to recog nize the authority of anyone. There are many of them scattered all over the country as far as Muhail and Birk, plying the trade of butchers. Although respected for their bravery, they are despised by all true Arabs for their mixed blood, and their lack of religion which almost amounts to paganism. Sub-tribes :— Bul 'Uryan, 2,500 men, mostly nomad. Bani A'isa, 1,200 men, mostly settled. Bani Sulaim, 2,000 men, mostly nomad. Bani Suhaim, 600 men, mostly nomad. WABA'AH— See Qahtan. YA'LA (B ani)— The Bam Ya'la (Ya'li, Ay'al,) are a small settled tribe, numbering 500 men, situated along the coast a few miles north of Hali. They are bounded on the north bv the Marahiba section of the Bani Zaid, on the east by the Aulad-al-Alona section of the Ahl Hali, and on the south by the Shawara section of the AhJ Hali.

ZAHRAN— The Zahran is one of the largest tribes of 'Aslr and is bounded on the north by th« Bam Malik and Shalwa, on the east by the Ghamid, on the south and south-west by the Zubaid, and on the west by the Dhuwwi Barakat for a few miles and then the Dhuwwi Hasan. Their western boundary approaches in places to within 15 miles of the coast, and inland they go up the main mountain range and beyond the Abha-Taif road. Their country is a fertile one and is thkMy populated, the whole tribe being said to number 30,000 mem . It is divided into two main divisions, the settled and the nomad, each of equal size, Rashid Ibn Juma'an is paramount Shaikh of the villagers and belongs to the main sub-tribe, the Bani Sadr; Sa'id Ibn Asaidan rules over tfie nomads. The former won his title by inheritance, the latter by his prowess in war; but they are both good men and have their tribesmen well in hand. When he was a young man, Rashid Ibn Juma'an sided with the Turks and was made a Bey, but twelve years ago he raised a successful revolt and has barred the country to the Turks ever pince. The nomads were always against them and against the villagers for the same reason, but since the revolt the two chief Shaikhs have been good friends. Rashid Ibn Juma'an is now a big fat man of 55. He lives at Jabal Dus and is married to JSafala of the Aulad-al-Amir Muhammad Ibn 'Aidh family of the Bani Maghaid. The Zahran are purely a fighting race and never leave their country, except to raid. They cultivate and become rich thereby, but they despise all other forms of manual labour. The Ghamid are their great and hereditary enemies. They declared for the Idrisi when he first raised his standard in 'Asir, and fought for him in 1912 against the Turks and Sharif of Mecca, In May 1915 they wrote to the Idrisi, proposing to join him but the Idrisi, doubtless realizing that they oould do little good while hedged in between the Turks at Abha and the Sharif, advised them to adopt a passive attitude for the present. He, however, sent a Qadhi to them to obtain monetary help, and early in 1916 reported that he was still in friendly communication with them.

To the north they inhabit the villages along the Qunfudah-Lith road for some 14 miles, till they reach the boundary of the A1 Difra section of the Zubaid. To the east they stretch along the Baraq road for 12 miles, almost to Umur of the Nawashara section of Bui 'Air, and then keeping always about 10 miles from the coast. Their boundary runs south for 20 miles, marching first with the confines of the Maja'da section of the Bui 'Air and then with the 'Umur Bedawi till it reaches the Bani Ya'la when it turns due west to the coast. * They are partly settled and partly nomad, the former numbering about 4,000 men the latter 3,000. The villagers are by no means wealthy, but there is a sufficiency of rain to enable them to cultivate in the summer and their wells proviie water to grow vegetables in the dry season. The two nomad sections are the Rabi'a-Waina and the Marahiba: the former strung out along the Qunfudah-Baraq roa l, the latter roaming the country to the south of Qunfudah along the coast and inland. They are rich in camels, and are the chief carriers to Hali, Muhail and Baraq. Most of them carry antiquated rifles, swords, and a curved knife about 3 feet long, called a Janbiah. They also supply Qunfudah with milk, and are looked down on by the more independent tribes, both for this practice and for their lack of prowess in war. Hasan Ibn Khidr is the principal Shaikh of the whole tribe, a man of about 30, who has proved a faithful servant of the Turks. He held firm when the Idrisi threatened Qunfudah in 1912, and was given 2,000 rifles by the Turks for defence. The Bani Zaid doubtless owe a great deal to the Turks, for they are on terms of enmity with their neighbours the Bui 'Air and AI 'Umur, and are raided by such distant tribes as the Bani Aissa, Dhuwwi Barakat, and Dhuwwi Hasan, who slip through the Zubaid country and back again before they can be brought to book. The Zubaid themselves regard them with tolerance, and the Bani Y l 'la are their allies. Chief Shaikh : Hasan Ibn Khidhr. {a) Settled. 4,000.

Rabi'at Waina Marahiba ZUBAID— The Zubaid are a detached section cf the Harb, and indeed are locally called Harb, as often as their real name. When on the pilgrimage, they generally visit their northern brethren, and are received with honour, and similarly extend a warm welcome to any Harb who may be in their country. They, are hospitable and well conducted, and appear to possess the bravery of their race without its traditional lawlessness. Their boundary starts about 7 miles north of Qunfudah and, after runing along the coast for rather more than 20 miles, turns inland and follows the Dhuwwi Barakat boundary, till it reaches the Zahran. From there it runs parallel to the coast and about 30 miles inland along the confines of the Zahran, Ghamid, Bui 'Uryan, and Bani Shihr till it reaches a point due east of Qunfudah and then follows the boundaries of the Bui 'Air and Bani Zaid to the sea. The Zubaid are settled in permanent villages and are rich in cattle. Their land near the sea is barren except in the valleys, but increases in richness and fertility as scon as the mountains are reached. ^ ■) ,, Ha^an Ibn Khidhr. ..

They are equally strong in their feelings against the Turks, who in spite of their proximity have not ventured to interfere with them for years. Their chief enemies are the Ban i Shihir, but they dislike end despise the Bani Zaid. With the Dhuwwi Barakat, the Ghamid, and Zahran, they are friends. The Zubaid go in for gun-running to a certain extent, buying their rifles from Ruwais, near Jiddah north from Birk, and selling them chiefly to the Zahran.

Its boundaries are further defined by the Gharaimil hill on its east side, by the Qarat-ar-Rukban hill at its south-east corner where it meets the, oasis of Hasa, by the ;Ghar-ash-Sliuyakh hill at its south-western extremity, and by the Baraim hill on its western border towards the north end. Badd- al-Asis is described as a plain of sand interspersed with undulating rocky ground; the sand is reddish and the rocks are dark-brown in colour. Grazing consists of Thamam grass and of 'Arfaj and Rimth bushes, of which the last is particularly favoured by camels. The only well in Badd-al-Asis is Shatqam, about 5 miles north-west of Qarat- ar-Rukban, which is 2 fathoms deep, and contains good water.

Among all the nomads they are second in importance only to the 'Anazah. They occupy the eastern side of the Hejaz with the volcanic harrahs between the Syrian Haii road and the central Arabian steppes. Their pasturages run east to Qasim and Washam and south to the dirahs of the Qahtan, the Buqum and Shalawa, and the Sbai'. This country abounds in wells ; it has a regular if small rainfall in winter, and is not wholly dry m early autumn when it receives the end of the monsoon rains. It supports large herds of sheep and camels, and in places the grass grows so richly that the Bedouins gather a hay-crop ; everywhere there is a low growth of acatias and game is plentiful. The clans m the Hejaz, such as the Helissa, Meraukha, Kurzan, Sebbaha, Merashidah, and bmarra, are small in numbers and breed sheep only. There is a little cultivation in the harrah% no more than palm groves, and small 'Ataibah villages. The two great divisions of the tribe are the Roqah and the Barqah. The Roqah are chiefly m the Hejaz, the Barqah in the eastern desert. The paramount Shaikh of the Barqah, Muhammad Ibn Hindi, used to be a close friend and ally of Ibn Sa'ud, rode with him in raiding expeditions and aided him with fighting men. But the relation of the Ataibah to the Sharif of Mecca and to Ibn Sa'ud has been somewhat modified of late. The tribe used to belong to Ibn Sa'ud's confederation, only those clans which actually inhabited the Hejaz coming under the Sharif ; but at the same time 'Ataibah sympathies were on the whole with the Sharif, possibly because he was further away and exercised a less direct control. In 1910, his second son, 'Abdullah, raided Qasim, nominally on behalf of the 'Ataibah. Shaikhs. He captured Sa'ad, the brother of 'Abdul 'Aziz ibn Sa ud ; but the support which he expected from Ibn Rashid was not forth-coming, and when the Amir Abdul Aziz appeared in force, he made terms with him and retired. Ibn Sa ud undertook that the Ataibah should be tax-free and that Qasim should pay the Sharif £4,000 a year. The first part of this arrangement was not observed by Ibn Sa'ud and probably the second part met with as little respect. No sooner had 'Abdullah gone back to the Hejaz than the Amir raided the 'Ataibah on the ground that they had har boured the rebellious Aulad Sa'ud, the grandsons of his uncle, who had tried to raise Kharj and Harlq against him. In 1915, 'Abdullah returned to the charge. He carried an expedition as far as Sadair, in Najd, levied taxes from the eastern 'Ataibah, and had a successful encounter with the Braih, a division of the Mutair, and subjects of Ibn Sa ud. The Ataibah are foes of the Harb, than whom they are more powerful; they are generally on good terms with the two small tribes on their southern frontier, the Buqum and Shalawa, and at feud with the Qahtan. , The Roqah division number 2,500 tents, the paramount Shaikh being [Turki ibn Rubai'an. The chief Shaikh of the Barqah, 3,000 tents, is Muhammad ibn Hindi ibn Muslut. The principal 'Ataibah clans are as follows :— DJiuwi Thibeit — Ubeid ibn Jami 7 . Nasir ibn Muheia.

Range and territory. —An important Bedouin tribe of Najd, occupying the vast wilderness, 300 miles in extent, between Qasim and the Mecca country ; the Bedouin tribes which adjoin them are the Mutair on the east, the Shammar on the north, the Harb on the north west and the Buqum, Qahtan, and Sabai' oa the south. A great part of the routes from ' Anaizah and Buraidah to Mecca lies in their territory and Qasim caravans travelling by those lines are accustomed to enlist Rafiqs of the 'Ataibah. Their camps are seen especially at Dhariyah, Dukhnah, Miskah and Shibirmah. On the north their limit is at Wadi-ar-Rummah, and they are found as far east as the Qatan hill in that valley; and as Wadi-as-Sirr and Washam ; they are also among the Bedouins who frequent the district of Kharj, they are sometimes seen in'Aridh. and a few poor 'Ataibah occasionally visit Kuwait in search of a livelihood. The opposite direction they are known to encamp at Huwaiyah in Wadi Sabai'. The Dirah proper of the 'Ataibah consists of sandy or gravelly plains, sprinkled with isolated bergs of granite and basalt, but containing ex cellent desert pasture. Life and subsistence, —The majority of the tribe are nomads wandering dispersed through their vast domains; but the 'Ataibah have also some fixed villages, with palm groves, in the hills 100 miles to the north of Mecca, and clonics of settled 'Ataibah exist at different places in Najd, especially in Middle Najd or Qasim. The 'Ataibah live chiefly by the cancels, sheep and goats of which they own large numbers ; the wool of their flocks is short and coarse and suitable only for making ropes and Bedouin tents. Forty years ago the 'Ataibaji owned some of the best horses in Arabia, and good horses are even now said to be sold within the tribe for $200 each. The prices of camels, sheep, and goats are lower among the 'Ataibah than among the Mutair ; the best riding camels fetch only $60 to $70, the best baggage camels $40, and sheep and goats $3 a head. The 'Ataibah eke out out their subsistence by raiding, especially to the north of Wadi-ar- Rummah, and by protecting pilgrims on their way to Mecca. They carry their raids into most of the roads passing from Jabal Shammar southwards to Qasim and Riyadh. Character. —As a tribe the 'Ataibah are honourable, hospitable, and not inclined to treachery; more stable in mind than most Bedouins ; better fighters than even the re doubted Qahtan ; in religion moderate and free from fanaticism. They are Sunnis,'ATAIBAH m Rusdn. ^Amrah (Dhl). Majarri (Dhi), 'Habur. and Jawama'ah. Miqahisah. JSMydbinah. Khalifah (Dhi). Sakhalah. Sliaibah (Dhi) Zabalijah.

II—On the off foreleg of the animaL 0—On the off hindleg of the animal. 0—On the off cheek of the animaL ( On the off cheek of the animaL Political position. —The 'Ataibah have from early times paid allegiance to the Wahhabl power and in 1865 their annual contribution to the treasury of Riyadh was estimated at $12,000. In the civil war in Southern Najd about 1871 they sided with 'Abdullah against Sa'ud and, ass'ited by the treachery of the Qahtan, defeated Sa'ud when he attempted to subdue them. Subsequently, when the fortunes of Hail were in the ascend ant, they came under the authority of the Shammar Amir, who severely enhanced their taxation ; but in 1902, on the recovery of the Wahhabi power, they again became subjects of Ibn Sa'ud whose cause they always favoured and to whom they now render tribute at the rate of $1 on every 5 camels and $2 on every 10 sheep. The 'Ataibah are fairly well armed with trade rifles. They are enemies of every other tribe in Arabia. Settled 'Ataibah. —Up to this point we have been concerned with the 'Ataibah as a tribe of nomads, but it is necessary observe that residents of a number of fixed villages in Naid are described as 'Ataibah by descent. In Qasim the following villages are said to be wholly or partially possesse by 'Ataibah Qasr-bin'-Aqaiyil, Athlah, Badayah, Basr Bitah, Bukainyah, Ab-ad-Dud, 'Ain Ibn-Fahaid, Ghaf (1,) Ghammash, Haid, Jau'i Quwai'ah, Nafi, Rass, Saib, Shaihiyah and Wuzakh, to which should perhaps be' added Mudhnib. In Jabal Shammar territory Baqa'a is said to be occupied by'Ataibah of the Sa'adah section ; and in Sadair the people of Zilfi, and in 'Aridh those of Banban, Barrah and Rghabah, are mentioned as being to a greater or less extent ' Ataibah. Those of Zilfi belong to sections known as Farahid and Masa'idah, C52(w)GSB o p290 ATA—ATH ATAIFIYAH (HOR)— See Hammar Lake.

According to Plagrave this is the highest pass in the district, and is often called merely Ath-Thamyah, or the pass, in consequence. The same authority states that the mountain just to the east of the pass is called Jabal 'Atalah. The latter must be a peak of the 'Urmah range. 'ATALAH (J abal)— See 'Atalah (Thaniyat)— ATALAHAT (But)— An important halting-place on the Darh Zuhaidah, situated nearly 75 miles, as the crow flies, south by west from Najaf. At Atalahat there are three cisterns, one of which is round and the other two square, each of the two latter being double. They are half-buried in the sand, and are dry. There are also two remarkable wells. They are 230 feet deep, and square-cut, each face measuring about sixteen feet, and are skilfully hewn in the rock. Like the cisterns, they are dry. Near these wells are the ruins of many small houses, and also those of a large khan. The walls of the latter are still standing, and are some 14 or 15 feet high. Atalahat is also called Mafraq-ad-darh, because the track from Hail forks here, one branch leading to Najaf, and the other to Qasr-as-Sa'id, near the south-western edge of the Bahr-as-Shinafiyah.— {Ruber, 1881.)

Qasr'Athamin, now in ruins, lies nearly 4 miles to the north of Jal-al-Batn ; and about 5 miles further on, in a slight depression of the ground, is Birkat 'Athamin, a cistern some 16 yards square. It is visible at a considerable distance on account of two brownish mounds to the north and south of it, formed from the earth dug out when the cistern was made, and which, owing to the strange uniformity of the desert hereabouts, are quite conspicuous. To the north of Birkat 'Athamin is a chain, about 30 miles long, of isolated, flat-topped hills, also bearing the name of 'Athamm. They are roughly eliptical in shape, and average about 50 feet in height.— {Huber y 188L) ATHAR (N ahr)— A creek, with some habitations, in Fao {q, v.).

Tbey claim descent from Ma'z, who is said to have been a brother of 'Anaz, the ancestor of the 'Anazah. A part of the tribe in the Hisma plain east of 'Aqabah is known as the Ma'zi. In both names, 'Anz and M'az, the signification T 's goat. Some authorities state that the 'Atiyah tribe was the origin of the Huwaitat, the Haiwat, the Tarabln, Ma'zi, and Tiyahai. Whether or no this be the true explanation of the relation between the 'Atiyah and the Huwaitat it is certain that the connection is exceedingly close. The two tribes camp in each other's dirahs and aid each other against common enemies. The ^ Atiyah occupy the northern half of the ' Awairidh Harrah and are separated from the Moahib Harrah by the hollow plain, known simply as the Jauk through which winds the route between Al-Wajj and Tabuk. This Jau is reckoned to be the dividing line between the Ahl-ash-Shamal and the Ahl-al-Qibli, that is to say the northern and south ern Arabs. The 'Aityah are held responsible for the Hejaz line from Ma'an to Dar-al- Hamra. The coast from Shaikh 'Antar up to the Gulf of 'Aqabah is in their hands, m Well as the high barren hills between the harreh and the sea. Their rugged mountain district is unsuitable for camel-breeding. Of the sub-tibes, the Sidanyin and the Khuthairah inhabit the Harrat 'Awairidh, the Sidanyin being at the northern end with the Subut to the west of them. The Agailat used to be carriers of goods between Ma'an and Tabuk, but the railway must have taken away some of their trade. The Bani 'Aityah are stout in arms. Their foes are the Shammar, the Fuqarah, and the Wald Sulaiman. With the Fuqarah the 'Atiyah maintain an enesitinguishable feud. They raid the Harb and the]central clans of the Hataim. The chief Shaikh of the 'Atiyah is Muhammad ibn 'Atiyah, and the sub-tribes are Robilat, Ag ailat, Sidanyin, Al-Khuthariah, and Subut.

' They are also found at Sulaimaniyah on the left bank of the river below the Da'aiji creek. Outlying colonies of 'Atub are found at Kataiban and one or two other villages on the left bank of the river above Basrah Town; also at Dorah which is a short distance above Fao.

It is in fact the irregularly shaped strip cut off by a line joining Jabal Manifah to the foot of Musalla- mlyah bay, and its extent measured in any direction hardly exceeds 20 miles and is generally much less. The principal features of the Zor-al-Audhan coast are the capes of Ras-al-Ghar, Ras- al-Musainah and Ras-al-Bidya' ; of these the first is about 14 miles south-east of Jabal Manifah, the last in 8 or 9 miles further to the south and forms the northern entrance point of Musallamiyah bay, and the second is about midway between the other two but rather nearer to Ras-al-Bidya'.

The route between Wadi Tayin and Sharqiyah lies through Wadi Khabbah, and crosses the Najd-al-'Awai- nah between the head of the latter valley and the town of Ibra. Najd-al-'Awainah is C52(w)GSB 2q298 AWA-AWA close to the village of Sama'iyah, and the end of the pass is only about 12 miles from Ibra.

AWAIRIDH (A l)—. The northern arm of the Jabal 'Aja, which extends to the north of Hail, in Jabal Shammar.— {Doughty.) 'AWAIRIDH (H arbat-al.)— A mountainous, lava tract, which extends over some 165 miles, its greatest breadth being about 25 miles, and lies immediately to the south-west of a line drawn between Tabuk and Madain Salih. It is divided, from south-west to north-east, into three sections by the two watercourses, Wadi Ramuthah and Wadi Hamatah. The upper member of 'Awairidh, namely that lying nearest to Tabuk, is nearly 40 miles long and is named Harraltas-Sidiniyln, of which the platform consists of plain and ravine. The middle section is known as Al Khthurra, and is about 45 miles long. The Wadi Ramuthah descends from the coast side of the harrdh, passing between the two hills named Shaiban and Witr, and trending north-eastwards till it cuts the Hajj route, where it is counted the border of the MawahTb, the furthest of the southern 'Anazah. From the north-east of the Harrat-al-'Awairidh descends a main vaUey, Al-Akhdhar, to the north-westward. Both of the foregoing harrahs are in the dirah of the Bam' 'Ativah The third and southernmost harrah which is about 80 miles long, is a prodi gious fragment of old volcanic matter, with a multitude of crater hills upon a platform mountain of sandstone. The two highest peaks in this section appar to be those of Fawarah and Hawairah, which rise precipitately to a height of about 2,000 feet above the desert on the western side of the plain of Al-Hajar. The mean height of the lava floods in the northern parts of this section is about 5,000 feet, the summit of Jabal Anaz the greatest of the hillidn, being 7,600 feet. Between the middle and the southern sections is the Jau, a hollow plain at the foot of the sandstone underclitts of the harmh, shelving from the eastward, the mouth upon that side being more or less closed by certain sandstone [crags. Raiders use this track, thus avoiding the passage of the harrah, which is unknown to themselves, and difficult for any but home-born dhaluU The route between AL Wajj and Tabuk also passes through here, and is reckoned at seven days for loaded camels.— [Doughty.) 'AWAISAH— A group of wells in Kharmah (q. v.) in the Hasa district. Palgrave mentions a group of a dozen or more wells, named Oweysit ('Awaisah), between Riyadh and Al-Hasa. He describes them as lying in a huge natural basin,AWA—AWA hollowed out in the limestone rock, with tracks resembling deep trenches leading to it from every side, and as being so abundant in their supply that they not unfrequently overflow the whole space and form a small lake. He says the water was clear and good and that no other wells are to be met with on the entire line between them and Hasa. These wells cannot be identified unless on the supposition that Palgrave transferred the name Oweysit to some earlier stage in his journey than that to which it belonged, in which case they would probably be those of the same name in Kharmah. 'AWAISAH (ABU)— A Bedouin camping-ground, with a well, in the interior of Qatar (q.v.), 'AWAJ (SHA'IB)— A small watercourse in north-eastern Arabia, a part of which approaches to within about 20 miles of Linah, to the east north-east of the latter. It appears to trend south east, and to be a continuation of the ShaibGurabi. This shrflb divides the Nafud and A1 Hajarah, and is said to reach the Batin depression.— [Leachman, 1910-12.) 'AWAJIYAH (TRIBE.) See 'Anizah (Tribe); Wald Sulaiman sub-division of the Bishr section. AWAL— The old name of Bahrain Island, disused but still remembered. According to tradi tion Awal was the name of the first occupier, the brother of a certain Na'asan whose name also is supposed to survive in that of Jazlrat Umm Na'asan. The name Awal occurs in the annals of the earliest Muhammadan conquest, f Palgrave, however, considers this name to have arisen through a mistake. He states that the word awal is commonly used for a shark, and as many of these fish are to be found off Bahrain the name came to be applied to the island itself. AWAL— A camping ground in Jabal Shammar, situated nearly a hundred miles south-west of Hail, and just north of Jabal Sfa. The ground itself is called 'Awal and the landscape, Ghulfa. Water is to be found in the camping ground in certain {Doughty.) 'AWALI (HAKRAT-AL)— One of the numerous harrahs of Hejaz, lying to the south-south-west of Al-Madmah, and to the south-south-east of Harrat-al-'Anabis. {q. v.)—[Doughty.) ^AWAMIR— Singular 'Amari. A large Arab tribe of 'Oman, by race Nizariyah, but now in politics Hinawivah. About one-third of them are Bedouins ranging the borders of the Ruba'- al-Khali from Trucial 'Oman in the north, which they occasionally visit in small numbers, to the district of Dhufar on the southern coast of Arabia. The other two-thirds are now settled, chiefly in 'Oman Proper where they possess the villages of 'Aqil, Qal'at -al-'Awamir, Falaj, Hamaidhah, Quriyatain, Qarut, Khurmah, Shafa', Saiyahi and Suq-al-Qadim and are found at Nizwa: they occur also at Masqat Town, Bait-al-Falaj, and Ruwi in the Masqat District; at Ghallah and Sad in Wadi Boshar ; at Hail A1 'Umair, Sib and Ma'bllah in Batinah ; at Kh5dh in WadiSamail and at Khubar and LuwTz in Daghmar. In 'Oman Proper the settled 'Awamir number about 2,500 souls and are divided into the following sections : Ahmad (Aulad) 'Ali-bin- Hamad' (Aulad) 'Ali-bin-Khalf (Ajilad) Amir (Aulad) Haramilah, Ja'afarah, Ja'id (Aulad-al-) Khanajirah, Muhammad Musa (Aulad), Rakhbah, Ra^hid (Aulad), Saba (Aulad) Saif (Aulad) Sallm (Aulad) Sand (Aulad), Sarahin, Sarahin-al-Muwailah and Shiraz (Aulad); those at Nizwa are of the Aulad Saif section, and at Sib a section called Aulad Mahaiyi'are found. The settled Awamir outside 'Oman Proper are about 4,000 persons. ♦See Ttoute* in Arabia, 1913. « « r. i fide Le Strange's Lands ol the Eastern Galipnate, 2Q2800 AWA-AWA Their migratory habits and the slightness of their contact with civilisation renders a close estimate of the strength of the Bedouin portion impossible ; but, regard being had to the wideness of their distribution, they may safely be assumed to be numerous and perhaps amount to 3,500 souls. The total strength of the tribe is thus probably about 10,000 souls. A term 'Afar frequently used in connection with the 'Awamir, appears to denote a portion of the tribe inhabiting a particular territory, called 'Afar or Dhafrah, between Mah5t and Dhufar; it includes representative of many sections. The 'Awamir are reputed brave and warlike, but crafty, treacherous and predatory ^ they are said to plunder indiscriminately all whom they meet, not excepting members of their own tribe with whom they happen to be unacquainted. The 0 'Afar are popularly supposed to feed upon carrion: they deny this, but admit that they are not infrequently reduced to devouring the animals' skins with which some of them are clothed. The 'Awamir speak a peculiar dialect of Arabic and the language of the westernmost sections is hardly intelligible to their settled brethren in 'Oman Proper The tribe is Ibadhi in religion ; they are at feud with the Jannabah and the Daru'° The tribal capital is 'Aqil. 'AWlMI— A tribal district in southern Arabia, lying immediately to the north of the town of Tarlm, in the Wadi Hadhramaut, and between that valley and the Bahr-as-Safi desert. 5 AWAMIR— A sub-division of the Bani Ruwahah tribe {q. v.).

'AWlZIM ('Aqalat-al)— Biyadh.AWA-AWA 801 'AWlZIM ( Tribe)— See 'Ataibah (Tribe). ^ 'AWAZIM—- Distribution, —Singular 'Az mi. A preponderantly Bedouin tribe now hardly found in Eastern Arabia outside the limits of the Kuwait Principality, within which they range from Kuwait Town and Jahrah on the north to the borders of the Hasa Sanjaq on the south, and from the sea on the east to the beginning of Summan on the west; some, however, exist in the neighbourhood of Qatlf,Vhere they breed horses and camels and take menial service under various Shaikhs; and a few are settled in the fixed villages of Wadi-al-Miyah. About 250 non-nomadic families of the tribe are established in Kuwait Town, where one of the quarters is called after them; and 25 others possess the village of Dimnah. 'Awazim or Hawazim are apparently found in various parts of Central Arabia, espe cially at Jauf-al-'Umr, Sakakah, Taima and Baidha Nathil in Jabal Shammar, and at Ghat in the Sadair district of Southern Najd; but these'Awazim or Hawazim are possibly not identical with the Kuwait 'Awazim and may belong to the Hat aim tribe {vide article) or to the Harb*. Origin and traditions —The Shaikh of Kuwait says that the name 'Awazim means the ' segregated ', and that they are sprung from the bastard children of a victorious Turkish army in Central Arabia, who were collected and formed into a tribe. This story appears improbable, especially as it is not supported by anything peculiar in the physical characteristics of the 'Awazim and involves the difficult supposition that the word 'Awazim was originally 'Awazil; its erves, however, to illustrate the slight esteem in which the 'Awazim are held socially. The tribe themselves claim to be an offshoot of the Harb, and say that their name means ' quick in starting ' and refers to a sudden tribal dispersion, of which their accounts are various and conflicting; it is generally ascribed to a difficulty with the Sharif of Mecca. Some of the 'Awazim admit the descent of their tribe from a Harb foundling adopted by the Mutair. The 'Awazim appear to have immigrated into Kuwait territory about three generations ago and the island of Umm an-Namal was granted to the Adhyaibat sub-division by the great-grandfather of the present Shaikh of Kuwait. Numbers and divisions. The 'Awazim Bedouins of Kuwait are divided into two main sections, the Ku'ah, 'Aiyal Kuwai' or Aulad Kuwai', and the 'Aiyal Ghiyadh. The who on Ku'ah, account of their supposed descent from an elder brother take precedence of the 'Aiyal Ghiyadh, are subdivided into the Hadhalin, Braikat, and Shqufah, each of which sections has a Shaikh of its own: the Braikat are not considered to be true descendants of Kuwai'. The 'Aiyal Ghiyadh are subdivided into the Mala 'ibah, Musahimah, Misa'idah, Adhyaibat, Jawasirah, Muha- libih, Muwaijiyah or Mwaiji, Aghrubah, Karashah, and Sawabir. One authority mentions a subdivision called Tuwalin, without indicating to which of the divisions it belongs. The Aghrubah and Muhalibah are so much scattered that they hardly possess a corporate existence. The Adhyaibat and Muwaijiyah admittedly have no Shaikhs of their own and are variously represented as being included with the Mala'ibah or the Sawabir; and the Shaikh of the Sawabir appears to be also Shaikh of the Misa'idah. The strongest subdivision are the Misa'idah, and the Hadhalin are among the weakest. The number of the Bedouin 'Awazim in Kuwait territory may amount to 4,000 souls. Occupation and resources. —The 'Awazim of Kuwait are pastoral nomads, fishermen and pearl drivers, and some of them cultivate melons at Warah in the 'Adan district. Their camels are estimated at 7,000 and their sheep and goats at 1,40,000, but these numbers are probably exaggerated: they have some donkeys, but no cattle and only 15 horses. Religion, social position and customs. —Vague stories are current that the 'Awazim in other parts of Arabia have a strange religion of their own; but those in Kuwait ter- ♦This is a difficult question which it has not been possible to clear up at the present time, though the names 'Awazim and Hawazim could hardly, one might suppose, be confounded by Arabs. The ' Hawazim ' of Wallin the 'Azzamees ' fof Palgrave, and the Howeysin of Lady Anne Blunt must apparently all be the same people • and the first and the last, at any rate, resembled the 'Awazim of the Kuwait in being of undistinguished origin* Wallin found the Hawazim living intermingled with the Shararat, despised and poor, and robbed of almost all their animals by raiding parties of the Southern Shammar. The latest reports however state that the 'Awazim, the Hawazim section of the Harb and the Hawazim section of the Hataim are entirely distinct from and independ ent of one another,302 'AWlZIM ritory are now without exception Sunnis of the Maliki persuasion. By the Arabs the 'Awazim are regarded as an inferior tribe, and they intermarry only among themselves and with the Rashaidah. The Mihr or price paid for wives among them was formerly only 40 Riyals, of which half was given in kind; it has now risen to 100 and even 200 Riyals. Political 'position. —The tribe are at present loyal subjects of the Shaikh of Kuwait and, from the militay point of view, the backbone of his state; the Shaikh regards them, despite their dubious origin, as good fighting men—and with justice, for about 50 of them were killed in his invasion of Jabal Shammar in 1901, including three sons of the Shaikh of the Sawabir and several men of mark among the Jawasirah. The real head of the tribe is now the Shaikh of Kuwait, but a representative of the old tribal authority exists in Is'ud-bln-Habib-bin-Jam'ah of the Hadhalin subdivision. The 'Awazim are politically allied to the 'Ajman. Another authority gives a somewhat different description of this tribe as follows: The 'Awazim are a nomad tribe which is not admitted to marriage and fellowship by true Arabs. As a considerable tribal unit it is found only in and about the principality of Kuwait, ranging from the outskirts of the town itself (where some 250 'Awazim families are settled), down the coast nearly to Musalamihay, and for some distance inland. They must be the ' Kuwait nomads' who, Raunkiaer says, graze their herds south of the town in winter and resort in summer northwards to the districts round Zubair, and also control the wells of Tawill. There are also, however Awazim (or Hawazim) else where, who have the same sort of status, but are members of Hataim or Harb (e.j/., in Jauf-al-'Umr, Taima, Sadair, etc.); and there is a distinct Harb clan of the name at Wadi-al-Khaif near J. Fikra (see Harb). The Kuwait 'Awaizm are partly pastoral partly follow marine occupations, pearl-diving and fishing. They are great breeders of camels, often taking service [e.a. at Qatif) under alien masters for stud-labour. They are subjects of Kuwait, and form the bulk of the Sultan's fighting forces ; it is due also to their activities that he is able to claim Bubian Island, to which some of their herdsmen resort. They are allied with the 'Ajman, and number some 4,000 souls. It appears that they are comparatively new-comers into Kuwait territory, and their tradition is that they were formerly with the Harb in East Hejaz. The one thing certain is that they are regarded by Bedawis as of the same standing as Hataim or Saluba, and credited with secret non-Islamic beliefs. In fact, however, they are Maliki Sunnities.

'AYUN— An important town in Qaslm, situated some 28 miles by road north-west from Burai- dah lying in a sandy basin and running north and south for about half a mile, with low hills round theree sides of it. It is without walls, which is rather the exception in central Arabia and remarkable in a border town. A large mosque stands in an open square, but there is no suq. The population is estimated at about 4,000 souls. The people of 'Ayun have suffered severely in the various struggles in which they have become embroiled during recent years, and few old men are to be seen there. The inhabitants appear to be broad-minded, business-like, and travelled, and the community gene rally to be a contented one. There are numerous wells with a fairly constant depth of about 30 feet, the supply being abundant and sweet. 'Ayun is famous for its dates, of which a well-known variety is called shukari ; and wheat, barley, gaymi, and lucerne are also cultivated. There is very little grazing, and such animals as exist are fed on lucerne. Livestock includes camels, used principally for water- drawing, besides a few cows, sheep and goats, donkeys, and chickens. The small villages of Ghaf and Rodh le about 2 mile from 'Ayuu, to the south and west respectively, andAYU—AZA 305 § miles away to the north-east, is the village of Thall which is no doubt identical with the Wathal of Huber. 'Ayun is governed by an Amir appointed by Ibn Sa'ud from the leading family of the place, in which the office is hereditary. His business is to keep order, collect taxes, and muster levies to Serve under the banner of II n Sa'ud when required. {Leachman., December 1912). 'AYUN-AS-SIRR— A district in central Arabia, lying between those of Al-Mudhnib and Washam, and consisting of a depression roughly 21 miles from east to west, and 30 miles from north to south. It is bounded on the east by nafud, and on the west by a cliff supporting a part of the nafud known as Shaigiadah. Near the northern end of 'Ayun -aS 'Sirr, but just outside it, is Qasr Amar, and at the southern end is Qasr Sakran. On the western side is the small village of Al-Faidlnh. The more important of the other %asrs are :—• Thailan, Al-LahTyah, Ibn Nasir, Adamti, Ibn Sabah, and Barud. Water is generally found at a depth of a few feet, but is often brackish, Springs of saltsh water occur in several places. After rain there is much standing water. There is apparently no outlet for water drainage, which may possibly pass undergound to the Wadi-ar-Rummah. The district of ' Ayun-as-Sirr is traversed by the route between Mudhnib and Shaqrah.— {Leachman, December t 1912). 'AYUN'AS-SIRR ( village)— See Sirr (Wadi-as), sub-head Barrud-as-Sirr, 'AYUN-AS-SUWAINA'— A village in Wadi-as-Sirr {f.v.). 'AYUN (Najd-al)— A pass in Jabal Khamis [q.v.) in the eastern Hajar hills of the Sultanate of 'Oman. 'AYUNI {F ar!q-al)—• One of the quarters of the town of Mubarraz {q.v.) in the Hasa oasis, eastern Arabia 'AZAD (K han)— An old deserted sarai on the Baghdad-Karbala road at a distance of about 16 miles by road from Baghdad, 'AZAIR (Qal'at)— An old qaVah on the Darb Zubaidah; it is situated on the western edge of the Bahr an-Najaf a few miles by road from the town of that name. 'AZAIR— The reputed tomb of the prophet Ezra, domed and having a row of Jewish housea attached to the precincts ; it stands on the right bank of the Tigris midway between Qumah and Qal'at Salih about 30 miles by river from each. 'Azair is within the limits of the Tigris marshes and is included in the Qadha of Shatrat-al-'Amarah ; the surrounding Arabs are of the A1 Bu Muhammad tribe. There are some trees and gardens, but no village. This place is generally known as Ezra's Tomb. *AZAIRIJ.— A powerful and numerous sedentary tribe of 'Iraq, living in a tract of country on the right bank of the Tigris south-west of 'Amarah on the Abu Tabr canal. Under Turkish rule they used to farm from the government the estate Majar-as-Saghir, which com prises very extensive rice lands in the marshes at the tail ends of the Majar-as-Saghir and Bitairah canals. The 'Azairij lands do not come down to the Tigris but all lie inland. Their corps are almost entirely rice but a certain quantity of wheat, barley, and millet is also grown. The Azairiz largely use the mashhoof as a means of conveyance. The lands of 'Audah and Shattaniyah situated on the mainland or Jazirah (as the Arabs know it) at the Western edge of the marsh, are also now under lease to the C52(w )GSB. 2r206 AZA—AZI *Azairij, so thai towards the South-West there is practically no limit or fixed boundary to their influence until the Shatt-al-Gharaf and Euphrates tribes are reached. On the mainland however, the cultivators are the Bazun and A1 'Isa Arabs (Muntafikf Bani Sa'id Division) who own large flocks of sheep, and although they are now nominally subservient to the 'Azairij Shaikhs, in whose names the leases of their grounds stand the latter's control over them is the slightest. The principal 'Azairii Shaikhs are Shavvai-al-Manshad and Salman-al-Madhkur. Though officially joint partners in the whole estate, they are on bad terms with one another, and each one runs his partition distinct from the other. Salman's grounds lie nearest to the Tigris, while Shawai's portion is in the marshes and Jezirah. During the seige of Kut the 'Azairij Shaikhs especially Shawai, were reported to be intriguing closely with the Turks, but the position of their territory porbably led to exaggerated reports as to this. Salman and Shawai are both strong men and have their tribesmen in good control They keep up a paid force of 3—4000 footmen and could probably muster in all some 10,000 rifles. 1915 when the Turks advanced towards 'Amarah a call was made on the 'Azairij to come out and oppose this advance ; 3,000 man turned out in 12 hours. They are inclined to be turbulent, and, not living on the river and being difficult to approach, it would not be an easy matter to undertake punitive operations against them. They came originally from the Euphrates side and are said to be descendants of the Hamyar. 'AZAIRIJ— A riverside tract on the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab [q.v.) between Qurnah and Basrah. 'AZAIRIJ— A village in north-eastern Arabia, situated on the right bank of the Euphrates above and not far from Naariyah town. Before the great war, Azairij was the headquarters of the JNahiyah of the same name, and was the seat of a Mudir. 'AZAIRIJ (A l).— ^Gne of the tribes of the Muntafik confederacy (q.v.), not to be confounded with the Azainj of the Tigris below Amarah.

Position and boundaries. —The ' Azizlyah Qadha is situated on the left bank of the Tigris some distance below Baghdad City, and is enclosed by the Qadhas of Baghdad and Khurasan on the north-west, by that of Badrah on the north-east, by that of Kut-al- Amarah on the south-east, and by that of Jazirah on the south-west. 'Aziziyah appa rently reaches up the Tigris to the junction with the river of the Diyalah. Topography and tribes. —The Qadha contains only two villages of any importance: of these one is 'Aziziyah, described elsewhere under its own name ; the other is Salman Pak which is mentioned in the article on the Tigris.

Wild liquorice is another asset of some value. Administration. —The Qadha of 'Aziziyah belongs to the 2nd class. Aziziyah Village was until recently the seat of the Qaim-Maqam, while the only Mudlr in the Qadha was located at Salman Pak and was of the 1st class; after 1905 Salman Pak became the headquarters of the Qadha, and 'Aziziyah Village (on account of its inconvenient situation and the encroachments of the river) that of a Nahiyah only. The Dairat-as- Sanlyah owned the Shadi tract together with the Mamlahah or salt-field whic hit contains. 'AZIZIYAH (Village)— A village in Turkish 'Iraq, on the left bank of the Tigris about midway between Bagh- dad and Kut-al-Amarah ; it is about 50 miles from either in a direct line, but by river it is 117|: miles from Baghdad and 110 miles from Kut. Prior to 1860 there was at most only a police station upon the site now occupied by 'Aziziyah; but some years later the place began to develop in consequence of the acquisition of land in the vicinity by the Dairat-as-Saniyah ; and in 1884 from being the headquarters of a Nahiyah it became those of a Qadha. About this time the population of 'Aziziyah amonted to 1,000 souls of whom three-fourths were Sunni Muhammadans and the remainder Shi'ahs with a few Jews. After 1884 'Aziziyah again retrograded, partly in consequence of the in roads of the river upon the bank; and in 1905 it exchanged places administratively with Salman Pak, the latter becoming the chef-lieu of the Qadha while 'Aziziyah again descended to the status of a Nahiyah. The population of 'Aziziyah is now under 200 persons : there are about 30 small mud houses, only, and half a dozen shops. The means of artificial irrigation being wanting, there is consequently no cultivation; and the few inhabitants who remain draw their supplies chiefly from the adjoining Shammar Toqah tribe. The chief and almost sole kind of trade at 'Aziziyah is an export of liquorice • it is carried on by a Jew who holds a monopoly of it from the Government. A forest formerly reserved by the Turkish Government, exists on the Tioris bank near this place. 'AZMIYAH— A village, now possibly deserted, in the Biya lh district of Al-Hasa, in eastern Arabia; and situated near the border of the Qatif Oasis. Palgrave describes 'Azmlyah as being a wretched anl desolate village, of most unpromising appearance, but mentions that fuel was to be had there.—(1863). AZOV PATCH— See 'Ali (Shab). AZRAQ (Jabal-al)—- A range of hills running east and west, the centre of which lies rather more than fifty miles south-east from Salkhad, in Hauran. The usual caravan route between Damascus and Jauf-al-'Umr skirts the western arm of these hills. AZRAQ (Qasr-al). A small settlement in north-western Arabia, used as a halting-place on the caravan route between Syria and Jauf-al-'Umr. It consists of a ruined, Saracenic castle, stand ing amongst a few palm trees. It is similar to, but in much better repair than, Qasr Sal'dah at Kaf. Round Qasr-al-Azraq are many springs of good water. There are usually about 10 or a dozen inhabitants.— [Butler and Aylmer, February, 1908,) AZRAQIYAH.— A village in 'Iraq on the Euphrates one mile to the west of Fallujah. 'AZUR— A tribe inhabiting the village of Khashbat 'Azur in the Baldan-al-Habus division of the Sharqiyah district, and said to be a section of the Bani Riyam tribe. {q,v.)310 AZZ-AZZ 'AZZAH— A section of the Zubaid tribe —te.v.)

Near the former is the island of Perim {q. v.) dividing the straits into two parts which are known respectively as the Large and the Small strait. The narrowest part of the Large strait, namely that between the southern side of Perim, and the Sowabih Islands to the southward, is about 9 miles wide, and is a perfectly safe channel, there being deep water right across. In the middle the depths are from 100 to 175 fathoms. The 100-fathom line passes about 34 miles from Has Siyan, and 4^ miles off Dumaira Island. Within these distances it has not been surveyed. On the Perim side, a bank with a depth of 20 fathoms will be found near the island, except off the mouth of the harbour where patches of 9 fathoms are situated about half a mile off. The Large strait is clear of danger, and as both extremes of Perim are lighted, a stranger micht possibly prefer this passage to the other on a dark night. With regard to the Small strait, the navigable width for large vessels is rather less than U miles at its narrowest part, that is to say, between Obstruction Point and Oyster Island reef; and it has from 8 to 16 fathoms of water. As it opens out into the Red Sea the water becomes shallower; and in the fairway at Ij miles westward of Ras Shaikh Sa'id, and about 2 miles northward from Obstruction Point lighthouse, are many isolated patches with only 5 fathoms of water, and extending for about 6 cables in the direction of the channel. The fairway for heavy draught vessels is to the west ward of these patches. Southward of the Small straight the water quickly deepens to more than 20 fathoms. 1 , ttt -. u The Small strait is the more commonly used both by steam and sailing vessels. With the former the chief advantage is that it is the shorter and more direct route, and with latter, the option of anchoring afforded in any part of the strait in the event of the wind ^During the months of December, January, and February strong southerly gales blow in the southern end of the Red Sea ; and during June, July, and August, there is a thick haze in the straits.

Other wise Baghdad was an open town before the present war. On the left bank the remains of the city-wall form with the river a rough parallelogram about 2 miles long with an average width of somewhat over 1 mile containing the main town of Baghdad. About one-third of this area (the part next the desert) is empty or occupied by graveyards, ruins, and rubbish heaps. Towards the south there were once numerous date-groves, but in recent years these have been rapidly making room for new houses. One of the old gateways (called Bab-at-Tilism, the Talismanic Gate, bricked up in 1639) is now a military magazine. It is a fine octagonal tower standing at some distance from the houses in the south-east part of the long face of the wall that looks towards the desert. Towards the north-west end of the same stretch of wall is the Bab-al-Wastani (the middle gate), a domed octagonal chamber standing outside the present line of the wall with which it is connected by a ]ow bridge leading across the moat, flanked with walls on either hand. The quarters of the city that lie on the right bank begin further up-stream than those on the left, and extend to a greater distance above the bridge of boats. The city-wall on this side follows a more irregular course than on the other, and encloses an area of considerably less depth, but the vacant spaces within it are not so large proportionally as on the eastern bank. The streets of Baghdad are winding, ill-kept, and generally too narrow for the passage of vehicles. In the better residential quarters there are houses of considerable height, sometimes of three storeys, generally built of soft yellow brick; in the poorer parts of the town the houses are low and built of unbumt brick. There are few inequa lities of ground, though there is apparently a rise in the west town and one quarter in the west centre of the main town is higher than the rest. Among what can be regarded as main streets may be mentioned a road rather wider than the rest, leading from the main bazaar near the east end of the bridge of boats past the military barracks and Govern ment offices to the north-west gate (Bab-al-Mu'adhdham): shortly before it reaches the gate it traverses the maidan, the principal piazza of the town. A little north of this, in a back street, is the post and telegraph office. There are also, however, a fairly broad asphalted street constructed by Nazim Pasha, which runs from the south end of the ba: a -rs as far as the south gate, a short broad street which leaves the main thoroughfare referred to above at a point near the English Club (see below) and runs past the Government Cloth Factory and a Barracks, and a broad road which runs south from the south gate towards the village of Gararra, having on the east side a new zaptieh post, and a little further on, on the west side, a partly-constructed two-storeyed hospital belonging to the English Missiion. The general view of the town, as seen from a height, such as the tower of the Roman Catholic Church, is as a whole flat and monotonous, but certain prominent objects stand out above the general level. The most conspicuous landmark is the minaret of the Suq-al-Ghazal, or thread- market, a tower rising to about 100' in the very centre of the main town. Minarets and cupolas rise here and there, of which the most prominent are the domed shrine of Shaikh 'Abdul Qadir Gilani, near the south-east extremity ot the town, the blue cupola of the Jami'al-Maidan towards the west end, the summit ot the Jarai-as-Sarai nearer the middle of the town, close to the Government Office, and the Azbaq mosque, just within the Bab -al -Mu'adhdham. There is also the tall chimney o the Government Cloth Factory. The modem bazaars, in the district near the bridge, are long vaulted dark brick structures. The old bazaars are usually covered m with wood. The Citadel or Arsenal Les near the river in the northern quarter of the east town, and is used for military stores. The law courts and the civil and military offices of the Government form a block of buildings known a the Sarai, beginning about 350 yards above the bridge with a considerable frontage on the river. Immediately above is the local office of the Ddiraf-as-Sanlyah. The Customs house, on the left bank, is a little below the end. of the bridge of boats. About | mile below the bridge is the old British Residency, now converted into an hotel; the new British Residency, with its dependent322 BAGHDAD Baghdad is the chief industrial town in 'Iraq, but its manufactures are for tte mosfi part not mechanical. Machinery driven by steam was to be found in 1908 only in a private ice-fact:&gt;ry, an army clothing-factory, and army fiour-mills of the Turkish Government, and in two out of several wool-presses. The army clothing factory has a tall brick chimney which is prominent landmark. There were at the outbreak of war 8 to 4 ice-factories and flour-mills worked by oil-engines. The most important manu factures are the making of silken thread and stuffs : cotton and woollen goods and tent canvas are also made. Arab cloaks, r abas, are made in great numbers, and fancy goods both in silk and cotton are extensively produced. There are a number of tanneries, of which about 40 are in the suburb of Mu^adhdham, which turn out 5,000 sheepskins and goatskins per week ; the leather, though only rough-tanned, is much exported to Europe : native shoes and boots ar© manufactured from it^ The Baghdad coppersmiths are famous and numerous, there is a manufacture of clay earthenware. For purposes of transport the following animals could probably be obtained at a few days' notice: 300 mules, 500 ponies, 1,000 donkeys and 1,000 Camels (1903). The pack-mules are similar to the Persian breed, and the ponies sturdy and country-bred, and the donkeys are hardy and strong. In 1903 there were 80 4-wheeled, 4-horsed pilgrim wagons, each carrying about 14 men (depot at Kadhimain) also 20 2-horsed carriages and 14 horse-tram cars. A few motor-cars have been used in the service between Baghdad and Baqubeh. Besides the river-steamers, of which the Turkish Company owned 8 and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company 8, plying as far as Baghdad, there were about 100 safinahs, large sailing boats and 500 quffahs, which are largely used as ferry-boats. Baghdad absorbs most of the import trade of 'Iraq, and Basrah may be regarded as little more than its seaport. It is a centre of commercial transport, especially to Persia ; it is estimated by experts that three-quarters of the imported goods are trans mitted to Persia. Persia in return sends carpets, skins, wool, gums, and opium ; and wheat is obtained there in years of scarcity for local consumption. With regard to internal trade the importance of Baghdad is not so great, but it is the principal centre for the distribution, throughout the whole country, of cotton piece-goods, which con stitute half the total sea-borne imports of 'Iraq. To Mosul are sent sugar, coffee and spices, and metals, and in return come the best wool in this part of Asia with mohair and oak, walnut, and poplar timber, of which the two former are much exported. The timber which comes to Baghdad via Mosul comes mostly from further north. Baqubeh supplies fruit and firewood in return for manufactured articles. At the outbreak of war four British firms had agencies in Baghdad, and there were One or two German firms: the Imperial Ottoman Bank has a branch, and also the Eastern Bank. Inhabitants are of many races and relig ons. The Jews form the largest racial group» numbering about 55,000 ; the Arabs come next with about 38,500, of whom some 7,000 are Bedouin sojourners. The Turks number probably about 4,000, mostly belonging to the official calss, the Kurds, 5,500 ; the Persains 5,000. There are about 8,000 native Christians of various races, some Afghans and Pathans, who are mostly watchmen and door-keepera, a few Muhammadan Indians but no Hindus. The Turks live mainly in the west part of the main town: the Jews 1 old quarter lies north of the Suq-al-Ghazal (Thread- market) in the centre of the main town : the old quarter of the Christians lies west of Thread-market, but the Jews are over-running the Christians' quarter and the Christians spreading eastwards. Elsewhere Arabs, Persians, and Kurds are intermingled, but the quarters on the right bank are predoimnently Persian and almost wholly Shiah. Most of the European residents live along the left river-bank towards the south end of the town. The Jews are coming more and more to control the trade of Baghdad, making it more difficult for the European merchant to hold his own ; during the past 20 years the Chris tian merchants have for the most part disappeared and many Muhammadan merchants have found themselves forced to take Jews into partnership. Of the Moslems about five-ninths, inculdingthe well-to-do families, are Sunnis : about four-ninths Shiahs. The most influential Moslem inhabitant is the Naq'b of Baghdad,'Abdur-Rahman, who lives on the left bank of the river immediately above the British Residency. Of the Native Christians the Gregorian Armenians and Chaldaean Catholics numbered, about 10 years aero, each about 2,000; the Syrian Catholics about 1,400, the Roman Catholics (or' LatinaBAGHDAD 323 about 1^200, the Catholic Armenians 1,000, Protestants 200 but these numbers have probably increased during the interval, especially as Christians from northern Meso potamia have recently been moving into Iraq to escape the Kurds. The Roman Catho* lies, Syrian Catholics, and Catholic Armenians are closely connected and are under a single bishop (Bishop of Babylon, who resides at Baghdad). These Catholics are said to have increased in numbers in recent .years, and may considerably exceed the totals given above. The Christians are mostly Christians by descent: there are few recent converts. The followers of the different religions and sects are distinguished by characteristic clothes. Posts and Telegraphs.—Vj) till 1912, the European mails were sent via Damascus, a distance of rather more than 500 miles. This journey was generally completed by the camel post riders in 9| or 10 days. The route was then changed and the .mails were sent via Aleppo. A letter from Baghdad usually took about 18 days'to reach London by this route. Mails for India came via the Tigris, Shatt-al- 'Arab, and the Persain Gulf. Baghdad was connected by telegraph with Constantinople and with the submarine cable at Fao. There was also a line which ran waFallujahand Dair-az-Zor, to Aleppo. The telegraph service was unreliable and often interrupted. Bridges. —There is only one bridge connecting the eastern and western portions of the city. It is 240 yards long and consists of 24 wooden pontoons, moored both to the bank and to buoys in mid-stream. The roadway is fit for any use and is protected by a parapet or rail, but the steep slopes at each end make it difficult for horses and (especially at low water) for wheeled vehicles heavily laden. A section of three boats near the right bank can be swung downstream to let steamers or masted vessels through : the bridge can also be opened at the other end. In particularly high floods the whole bridge is removed. Flood?. —Heavy floods bring the water close round the city. Attention to the various hands prevents any serious flooding of the surrounding country, but failing such atten tion all the country in the vicinity of the city is liable to flood after the beginuing of March. To avoid country subject to flooding it is necessary to go upstream as far ai Sindiyah on the left bank and as far as Bal d on the right bank. From Baiad the edge of the higher ground swings in a rough curve to the head of the Saqlawiyah canal on the Euphrates, passing about 15 miles westward of Lake 5 Aqar Kuf. Baghdad Railway. —The line is single and has a gauge of 4' 8J''. The Baghdad-Mosul section runs along the right or western bank of the Tigris and as long ago as 1914 was completed as far as Samarrah, a distance of 73| miles. From Baghdad to Samaichah the line is good and a speed of 30 mil s an hour can be attained with safety; between here and Balad the line is only medium and. thereafter, bad. From Is tabu I at onwards it is very bad. The stations are as follows :—• A Turkish troop train took 5 hours to do the Journey from Baghdad to Samarrah in 1916. The Baghdad station is situated of a mile from the right bank of the river below the boat bridge and south-east of the house that, under Turkish rule, was the British Residency. The l.'ne runs out of Baghdad on an embankment about 20 feet high, over many culverts which are too low for cavalry to pass under. There is a level crossing to the west of the station. At Samarrah there is a small station with a platform of two or three trucks' length. At the intervening stations there are small cabins, but no platforms as yet. The rolling stock on this section was reported, in 1915, to consist of 7 passenger and 4 shunting engines, 60 ballast trucks, 40 horse boxes,' and 160 trucks. There are two telegraph lines between Baghdad and Samarrah one by the railway and the other distant. Miles from Baghdad. 0 Kame of Station.

A Decauville railway runs from Baghdad to Fallujah, via Kharr, Te] Aswad, Tel Thubbah, and Radhwaniyah. A horse-tramway runs from Baghdad to Kadhimain (3-| miles), starting from near the bridge of boats ; it is a single line of normal gauge ; there'were 14 two-hor?e cars each of which would carry 50 men. Sidings every half mile each siding accommodating three cars. A fairly regular motor service was established in 1913 between Baghdad and Baqubah r via Khan Bani Sa'Id. Anchorage and Landing. —The regular mooring-place for river steamers is on the left bank a little below the bridge of boats. BAGHDAD (Q adha)— A division of the Sanjaq, similarly named, in the Baghdad Wilayat of 'Iraq. Position and boundaries. —The Qadha of Baghdad is situated on both banks of the Tigris, partly above and partly below Baghdad City. It is bo imded on the east by the river Diyalah in its lower course, and on the south and west—except that it includes the trans-Tigris suburb of the City — by the Tigris: on the north and north-west it is in contact with the Qadha of Kadhimain and on the north and north-east with that of Khurasan. Topography. —The only points of any importance which the Qadha contains, besides the city of Baghdad itself, are Mu'adhdham and Qararah, each of which is described in a separate article under its own name. Population. —The fixed population of the Qadha may be estimated at 150,000 souls. Of these about 55,000 are Jews by religion, while 50,000 are Sunni Muhammadans, 37,000no BAG—BAH 325 are Shi'ah Muhammadans, and 8,000 are Christians. The articles on Baghdad City and Mu'adhdham give the composition by races of almost the whole population of the Qadha. Resources.—Most of the wealth in the Qadha belongs to the city of Baghdad, the article on which may be consulted. It remains to add that a considerable cultivation of fruit and vegetables is carried on upon the banks of the river immediately above and below the town, and even within the municipal limits. The gardens are irrigated from the Tigris by means of water lifts or pumps, and in many of them are situated country or pleasure houses belonging to wealthy residents of the town. The fruits grown are dates, grapes, peaches, nectarines, pomegranates, figs, plums, mulberries, quinces, limes, citrons, oranges, apples and apricots, but only the oranges are of the first quality ; the vegetables include ladies' fingers, brinjals, cucumbers, musk melons, water melons pumpkins, beetroot, carrots, cabbages, cauliflowers, turnips, cress, lettuce, beans, tomatoes, onions, garlic and radishes. Some of the vegetables are of recent intro duction ; on the whole they are good, but, as successive sowings are not regularly made, they are obtainable only during a short season. According to the old Turkish official statistics there are 769 water lifts in the immediate environs of Baghdad City, while date palms within the same limits number 177,800 and other fruit trees 130,000. The area of cultivation in the Qadha has been estimated at 1,850 Faddans. BAGHDAD (E ski)— n Some ruins in 'Iraq, situated about 6 miles south-south-west from Shahraban, on the Baghdad-Khanaqln road.

BAHG-I-SHAHI ( or , B aksat)— A village in 'Iraq close to the Persian frontier, on the Changulah river, and situat ed about 22 miles by road north-north-east from Shaikh Sa'ad. Alongside the present village is a large ruinous site. The grazing hereabouts is poor and there are no supplies, but the water-supply is plentiful and good from the river, though brackish in the summer, and there is a good deal of fuel to be had by the river-bed. For these reasons there are usually Arab and Lur encampments round Bagh-i-Shahi. Communica tion between the Tigris and Baksai is almost entirely from Jindil (Shaikh Sa'ad); the track between these two places is easy and passable for all arms.

It is one of the numerous villages of the Kattiri tribe, and as this tribe is constantly at loggerheads with the Yafei, whose frontier town is Shibam, it is probable that it is generally in a very unsettled state.

BAHARAH (A l)— A well-known halting place on the Jiddah-Mecca route, situated at a distance of about 8 hours' journey from the former town, upon a plain nearly 4 hours in length and two in breadth, extending eastwards. There is plenty of water in wells, some of which are sweet and some brackish. At Baharah there is a suq containing about 8 or 10 shops where are to be had rice, onions, ghi, dates, and coffee-beans, at about 30 per cent, in advance of the Jeddah prices. A small detachment of Turkish cavalry is stationed at Baharah to guard the road. The caravan from Jiddah to Mecca halts during the day at Baharah, or at Haddah, the next stage on towards Mecca. This is done not so much for the purpose of avoiding the heat as to afford the camels time for feeding, as those animals do not feed at night. (J. L. Burckhardt, August, 1814.)BAH-BAH Wavell says tliat the village of Baharah is supposed to be half-way between Jiddali and Mecca, but that in his opinion it is very much nearer Jiddah than Mecca. According to the same authority, ' it consists (1909) of a few shops, where provisions and fodder may be bought, some eating-houses, and kraals for cattle and goats. There are some date-plantations near by; and a large fort with a garrison, a company or more, affords the village the much-needed protection. Baharah lies in an open plain some few miles in width, bounded on the Jiddah side by a range of low stony hills which run out into sand-dunes to the east. Water seemed fairly plentiful, and was not noticeably salt.'' bah A rat sharhan— See Shammar (Jabal). bah A ri— See Qatif (Al) (Oasis). BAHARIMAH (T ribe)—• See Hajriyin (Tribe). bah A rinah— Singular Bahrani. The name of the race or class to which nearly all the Shi'ahs of the Bahrain Islands of the Hasa and Qatif Oases and of the Qatar promontory belong. The mistake of supposing that Baharinah means ' natives of Bahrain ' must be carefully guarded against; on the contrary the Sunni inhabitants of Bahrain repudiates the name of ' Bahrani' and describes the class to which he himself belongs as ' Ahl-al- Bahrain.' As employed along the western coast of the Persian Gulf, the term Bahrani is practically a synonym for a Shi'ah Muhammadan whose mother tongue is Arabic. Numbers and distribution. —In Bahrain the number of the Baharinah appears to be about 38,000 souls ; in the Hasa Oasis, if we include the Shi'ah population of the towns of Hofuf and Mubarraz, they are about 30,000 persons ; in the Qatif Oasis, inclusive of Qatif Town, they are perhaps 28,000 souls. In Qatar they have about 60 houses at I)5hah and 40 at Wakrah, representing in all about 500 heads. Some of the tribe have emigrated at various times to other parts of the Gulf, especially to some of the districts of^fche Persian Coast, such as Dashti and perhaps Dashtistan ; about 250 Baharinah are Settled at Sohar Town in the Sultanate of 'Oman and about 600 at the towns of Abu Dhabi and Dibai in Trucial 'Oman ; and the total number of the Baharinah cannot now be assessed at much less than 100,000 persons. Religion and character. —All Baharinah are Shl'ahs. They are unwarlike in character and tend to peaceful pursuits, the richer among them living by trade and the poorer by husbandry, pearl diving and various manufactures. They are as a rule inferior in the methodical work of business and in book-keeping to the 'Omams and Indians settled amongst them, but they excel in handicraft, e.g., as weavers, workers in metal, wood, leather, etc., and as tailors and dyers. A great many Baharinah emigrated from Bahrain to the island of Qais, on the Persian Gulf, between 1850-60. Leading families. —The Baharinah have no tribal cohesion or organization, but some of their leading families are distinguished by names. The prominent Bahrani families of the Hasa and Qatif Oases, if we except the 'Alaiwat, who are found at 'Anik in the Qatif Oasis, and the Al Bin-Ghanim, whose Shaikhs ruled Qatif Town until they were subverted by the Wahhabis—have not been ascertained ; but among the wealthier and more important in the Bahrain Principality are the following:— 'An'abirah ^ Majld (Al) 'Asafirah (or Al 'Asfur) 'Asakirah Ghabarah Hadadid Muslim (Al) Rafyah (Al) Rahmah (Al) and Suwar (Al Bin-) besides numerous families of Saiyids who are now recognised as Baharinah. The above are mostly large families of which branches are found in different parts of Bahrain. The Baqaqalah of Bahrain—but not those of Qatar who are Sunnis — are considered to be Baharniah ; so are the Hamidah.m BAH^BAS Origin. —The Baharinah are generally stated to have come into existence by the cdft- version of certain Arab tribes, including one called the Bani Rabi', to Shi'ism about 300 years ago ; this is the local Muhammadan tradition^ Some European writers on the other hand have manifested an inclination to regard the bulk of the Baharinah as an aboriginal tribe conquered by the Arabs. In the absence of sufficient ethnological data it is impossible to pronounce in favour of or against either theory, BAHARINAH— ^ A section of the Hajriytn tribe (q. v.) in 'Oman, BAHARINAH— One of the suburbs of Masqat town {q. v.)* BAHATA— A marsh hamlet in 'Iraq, situated some 10 miles from the left bank of the Tigris and perhaps 12 or 14 miles north-eastward from Qal'at Salih.

The site with the surrounding cultivation forms an irregular parallelogram about 2 square miles in extent, which is enclosed by a wall and stands on the left bank of Wadi Bahlah, a tribu^ tary probably of Wadi Halfain. The town, composed of a number of distinct villages or walled quarters, is in appearance one of the most striking in 'Oman. On an eminence in the centre of it rises a huge white fort with two towers, one of which is very lofty and commands a splendid view of the whole valley ; while around on various sides, the plain is broken by low hills less than two miles distant. The inhabitants of Bahlah are Mahariq (35 houses), 'Abriym (200 houses), Bayasirah (100 houses), Jannabah (30 houses), Miyayihah of the Maqarishah section (30 houses), Bani Jissas (30 houses), Bani Kalban (o0 houses), Bani RSshid (50 houses), Bani Shakail (40 houses), and mixed tribes, amount ing to about 3,000 souls in all. The crops grown on the town lands include wheat, barley, jowan, sugar, beans, gram and cotton ; there are also plantains and mangoes and the number of date palms is estimated at 3,000. There are 40 horses, 300 camels, 400 ? n ^ e J s&gt; cattle and 1,000 sheep and goats. Cloaks called Manasil are manufactur, e ot fane goats hair, some earthenware is made, and lungis are woven as in most of the arger p aces in Oman. Bahlah is believed to be a very ancient place and was for a time under the Nabham dynasty, who ruled at the beginning of the 17th centurv, the capital of all Oman. The principal Shaikh is Naslr-bin-Hamaiyid, a man of forcible c arac er w o attained his position about 1885 by the murder of two elder brothers Barghash and Rashid. In March 1885 a destructive flood occurred in the Wadi by, which many date trees and houses were swept away.

BAHRAIN ISLAND*— This island, formerly called Awal, is the largest in the Bahrain archipelago and lies al-- most in the middle of the unnamed V-shaped gulf which divides the Turkish territories of Hasa and Qatif from the promontory of Qatar. Shape, size and physical characteristics. —The shape of the island corresponds with that of the gulf, the coasts that front the mainland being approximately parallel to it throughout. From the northernmost point near Manamah town to the southern extremity at Ras- al-Barr, Bahrain island measures 30 miles: its maximum breadth from Ras-al-Jufair to Budaiya' is 10 miles. The total area of the island is 208 square miles, and about 18 Square miles are covered by date plantations. The principal date belt is at the north end of the island ; it is almost continuous from Manamah to Buri, with a length north-east and south-west of 7 and a maximum breadth at the middle of 3 miles; and it thus occupies most of the space north of the great marine indentation, known as Khor-al-Kabb, which penetrates from the east coast almost ta the centre of the island-. The greater part of Bahrain Island is flat and low, but the surface rises gradually from $11 sides towards the centre to form a plateau 100 to 200 feet high ; in the middle of the plateau is an oval-shaped depression, about 13 miles long from north to south by 4 broad, containing in its centre the solitary hill of Jabal-ad-Dukhan, 440 feet high, the most elevated point on the island. The descent inwards from the plateau to the depression is in most places too steep to be practicable for animals; it consists at the northern end of a nearly vertical drop of 20 feet followed by a deep slope of 30 feet. The plateau itself is extraordinarily stony and presents a line of low cliffs, perhaps 15- feet high, to the north, below which is a sandy plain extending in all directions to the 'coast and draining from west to east. Jabal-ad-Dukhan is of a dark hue, but elsewhere the rocks are light yellow or light pink, indeed almost white, in colour. Features of the coasts. —We need not dwell here on the geology of Bahrain Island, which- is dealt with at length in the article on the Bahrain Principality ; but it will be convenient to give at this point, in alphabetical order, a list of the chief features and points of interest —other than inhabited or cultivated spots — which occur upon the coast:— Name.

Miscellaneous, —The article on the Bahrain Principality may be consulted in regard to all matters not dealt with above which concern Bahrain Island. Here, however, we may mention that in Bahrain Island a space of more than 12 square miles is covered by fields of pre-historic tumuli, by the Arabs called Muraqib: they lie for the most part on the glacis of the plateau to the north of the central depression, and those of the largest size and seemingly greatest importance are close to the village of 'Ali. The inhabitants are mostly Shiahs though according to Palgrave Christianity formerly predominated here. BAHRAIN PRINCIPALITY.—* The term Bahrain once embraced the promontory of Qatar and the'Oases of Qatif and Hasa as well as the islands of the archipelago ; some authorities indeed would attri bute to it in the past an even more extended application, affirming that it once denoted the whole western side of the Persian Gulf from Ruus-al-Jibal to the mouth the of Shatt-al-'Arab. The derivation of the name is uncertain. Its apparent meaning is ' the Two Seas,' but the reference is not clear and is interpreted in different ways. Extent and importance. —The present Shaikhdom of Bahrain consists of the archipelago formed by the Bahrain, Muharraq, Umm Na'asan, Sitrah and Nabi Salih islands and by a number of lesser islets and rocks which are enumerated in the articles upon the islands : taken all together these form a compact group almost in the middle of the Gulf which ♦This leading article on the Bahrain principality and the minor articles on places in the same are founded chiefly upon systematic and careful investigations made on the spot during the years 1904-05. The information available from sources existing before 1904 was arranged by Mr. J. G. Lorimer, I.C.S., and was issued in Novem ber of that year in the form of 9 printed foolscap pages intended to serve as a basis for further inquiry. The inquiry croner was begun by the writer on tour in Bahrain early in 1905 ; but it was carried out chiefly by Lieutenant C. H Gabriel I. A. who personally travelled over the greater part of the islands, and by Captain F. B. Prideaux, Political Agent in Bahrain, who supplied very full information regarding all places in his jurisdiction. A set of draft articles founded on the notes and reports of 1905 was then prepared by the writer, it was finished in Januarv-1906 and extended to over 60 octavo pages of print. These drafts were sent to Captain Prideaux, by whom they were very carefully revised with the assistance of Mr. In'am-al-Haqq, the Agency Interpreter, a graduate of the Ali^arh College. Early in 1907 the drafts were re-issued, with modifications and additions, and some noints which remained doubtful or obscure were disposed of by Captain Prideaux and his assistant during the year Geological information was kindly furnished by Mr. G. Pilgrim of the Geological Survey of India. The articles in their final form now occupy over 70 octavo pages. .

Connected with the sovereign ty of Bahrain, or possibly appertaining to the Shaikh as hereditary personal property, are certain ill-defined rights upon the mainland of Qatar, at present (1905) under discus sion. Whatever the nature or extent of these rights, our attention will be confined, in the present article, to the undisputed insular possessions of the Shaikh. On the western side of the Persian Gulf, Bahrain is, agriculturally and commercially the most valuable district. Its position moreover as regards the Persian Gulf is central for the distance of its port and capital from the entrance of the Gulf is only a little greater than its distance from the mouth of the Shatt-al- 'Arab. On the Arabian side of the Gulf, Bahrain has no rival in political importance except the principality of Kuwait; and the Turkish province of Hasa, although it affords the best and shortest approach from the Gulf to Najd, is itself commercially dependent upon Bahrain. ^ * j • ,1, Marine surroundings. —The most striking feature of the Bahrain group of islands is the lowness and levelness of the land and the shallowness of the environing^sea. The whole, ■Gulf of Bahrain from Has Rakan to RSs Tanurah, a distance of 73 miles, is, except for one clear and fairly wide channel which runs north and south off the east coast of Muhar- raq Island, a mass of reefs and shoals. The most extensive obstacles to navigation in the archipelago are the Fasht-ad-Dibal, between Muharraq Island and Ras Rakan, four miles long from north to south by three miles broad, and the Fasht-al-Jarim, 15 milea long north and south by 9 miles broad towards its northern end, which shelters the har bour of Manamah from north and west winds. Many of the reefs of the Bahrain islands are partially dry at low water. On the side towards the open sea the shallow waters of Bah rain may be considered to end at the Rennie Shoal, 54 miles north cf Muharraq. There is a passage, called the Khor-al-Bab from Manamah to Qatif south of the Fasht-al-Jarim which is practicable for vessels drawing not more than 15 feet. Many pearl banks are situated in these waters; their names and positions are given in the Appendix on the Pearl Fis herie s. The Western Shore is low, and composed of a dark, tenacious mould, stpeed in moisture like a dry sponge and is very unhealthy.—(Pa^rave). Geology. —The main island of Bahrain forms a striking geological contrast to the other islands of the Persian Gulf. The rocks are chiefly white or pale-coloured limestones of the eocene age, sometimes sandy or argillaceous, and so disposed as to form a low anticlinal dome of which Jabal-ad-Dukhan is the summit. In the hollow between the girdling plateau (described in the article on Bahrain Island) and this central peak the rock has been denuded by marine agency and forms a plain. In places the eocene limestone rocks are highly fossiliferous and contain foraminifera, echinids and mollusca : as a whole they are characterised by an abundance of siliceous material, occurring as flint, as cherty concretions or as quartz geodes, and by the dissemination of gypsum and salt throughout the series in a marked degree. The presence of the salt and the gypsum is most conspicuous in certain places where they have been leachedout of the rock and have formed vast accumulations of saliferous or gypseous soil. The most distinctly marked areas of this character are one towards the south end of Bahrain Island and another on the island of Umm Na'asan, and the gypsum'fields of the latter sup ply practically all the mortar that is used in Bahrain. The coastal portions of Bahrain Island, as also of the other islands of the group, are overlaid with sub-recent coral rocks or shelly concrete; and sandstone of the same age is found in the central depression of Bahrain Island. This depression, as well as the littoral flats, has in fact emerged from the sea in comparatively recent times, and the remains of the old sea-beaches are well marked. A small deposit of asphalt is found penetrating the eocene rocks 3 miles south- south-east of Jabal-ad-Dukhan. The Bahrain island are famous for a remarkable set of springs, beautifully clear and but slightly brackish, some of which are submarine; the majority of them are enumerated in the articles on the principal islands, and here it will be sufficient to mention that in the north ern part of Bahrain Island, north of Khor-al-Kabb, they are warm, copious and nearly fresh, the best known in that district being those of ' Adari, Qassari and Abu Zaidan. The most note-worthy springs in the sea are that of Abu Mahur close to Muharraq Island and the Kaukab on Fasht Khor Fasht. The best water in the islands is obtained from the Hanaini wells, at the north end of the central depression of Bahrain Island, and fromBAHRAIN The principality then contains, on such an estimate as it is possible to form, 4 towns with a population of 60,800 souls and 104 villages with a population of 38,275; in all 99,075. To these must be added about 200 non-Muhammadans at Man amah,'making a grand total of 99,275 settled inhabitants. The only nomads are Na'im Bedouins, who frequent the island in varying numbers, and a few Ka'aban who have no settled residence. Of the whole population of about 100,000 souls, some 60,000, chiefly townsmen are Sunnis and about 40,000, mostly villagers, are Shi'ahs. The largest community—for it cannot be called a tribe—in the principality is undoubt edly that of the Bahranis or Baharinah, who compose nearly the whole of the Shi'ah community and more than three-fifths of the rural population. The remainder of the people, except a few foreigners such as Persians and Basrah Arabs, Hindus, Jews, etc., belong to various Sunni tribes or classes, of which the most important, numerically or for other reasons, appear in the following synopsis :— Name.

Although the Baharinah are numerically the strongest class they are far from being politically the most important; indeed their position is little better than one of serfdom. Most of the date cultivation and agriculture of the islands is in the their hands ; but they also depend, though to a less extent than their Sunni brethren, upon pearl diving and other seafaring occupations. The Hiiwalah are the most numerous community of Sunnis; but they are all towns-men living by trade and without solidarity among themselves ; consequent* iy they are unimportant, except commercially. The 'Utub, the Sadah and the Dawasir are the most influential tribes in Bahrain ; the first on account of their connection with the ruling family, the Sadah by virtue of their sacred origin, and the Dawasir because they are comparatively wealthy, united, and obedient to their chiefs, and partly, perhaps, that as the most recent immigrants from Najd they enjoy a certain prestige. The remainder of the Sunni population are mostly settled on or near the coast, and depend chiefly on the sea and in a lesser degree on cultivation, for their sub sistence. The races inhabiting Bahrain are generally insignificant in appearnce and there is nothing remarkable in their character. The pearl diving sections of the community seem to be distinguished by weak eyes and raucous voices. The huts in which the bulk of the rural population live are constructed of date or reed mats and have gable roofs. In concluding this paragraph we may notice that, though negroes are numerous in Bahrain, a mixture of Arab and negro blood is here less frequent than in the ports of 'Oman and Trucial 'Oman. The analysis of population given above shows that there are nearly 5,000 free negroes and 0,000 negro slaves in the principality, and these figures are probably much below the mark as it has been impossible, except in the larger places, to distinguish negro families from the communities among whom they live or by whom they are owned. The reason given for the non-mixture of blood is that in Bahrain a full- blood negro slave is more valuable than a half-caste son. The services of slaves are hired out by their masters for the pearl fishery, and in winter the slave and his family are left to support themselves. In some cases the slave is married to a free woman with whom his master has no concern ; but in others the master provides the slave with a slave wife and takes possession of the offspring. Agriculture and domestic animals. —The agricultural products of Bahrain are chiefly fruits, lucerne and a few vegetables; the last, including brinjals, cucumbers, carrots, leeks and onions, are almost the only non-arboreal crops. The supply of vegetables is suffi cient for local consumption and none are imported. Plant growth generally is rank, but 2^ BAHRAIN the produce is poor. The citrons of Bahrain are, it is true, the best in the Persian Gulf and there is a kind of smaU and luscious banana; but the date palms are here of a dull green and have a poor and stunted appearance, while the other fruits, whether almonds, apricots, fags, grapes, limes, melons, peaches or pomegranates, fall below mediocrity. There are some tamarinds, and the mango and mulberry are seen, but are rare. The soil is perhaps not sterile, although, without cultivation, it does not ordinarily produce even grass ; deficiency of rainfall is probably the chief reason, for in exceptionally wet years grass is said to grow knee-deep all over the central depression of the main island to the edge of the Mimlahat-al-Mattalah. All cultivated land is irrigated from springs or wells. The springs arc many and copious, but the low level at which many of them lie makes it necessary to conduct the water to the plantations in very deep cuttings, which in places are lined with stone and in others are carried through outcrops of rock. Irrigation is of J kinds, and date plantations are distinguished as Nakhl-as-Saih, Dulab and Nakhl-al- Gharrafah; of these the first kind is watered by gravitation from fiowing channels, the ®® co f 1 d . b , y . a llft ° or 2 akms raised by bullocks or donkeys walking down a slope, and the third by a Gharrafah or lever and skin with a counterpoise.* Fish-manure is used to fertilise the date groves. Agncultral produce is brought to market daily in the Manama,h iazar and weekly at the Suq-al-Khamis fair (on Thursdays) and at a place near Qal'at-al-'Ajaj (on Mondays). F . most valuable of the domestic animals are donkeys of a particular breed, from 12 to 13-1 hands in height; they are generally white but a few incline to greyness, probably on account of impure breeding. The stock was originally imported from Hasa and is perhaps the finest kind of donkey in the world. The females, being less noisy than the males, are sold at higher prices, and a good one sometimes fetches as much ai Rs. 500: the stallions are all sold to professional donkey boys, who hire them out in the towns for ndmg or carrying loads Only about 200 of these donkeys, it is said, now exist upon the islands, but the number of donkeys of all sorts, according to the statistics obtainable, is nearly 2 000 The ordinary donkeys, about 1,800 in number, are of all colours—white, grey, black and brown-and vary in height from 12 to 10 hands and less ; they are useful and capable of hard work. The provender of donkeys is chiefly lucerne, dates and grass. Horses are only kept by the family of the ruling Shaikh ; thiy are generally of pure Najdi blood, but have somewhat deteriorated through being bred in an unsuitable climate. No horses are bred for exportation: those owned are about 50 in number. AbouflOO camels are owned by the Shaikh and his family and perhaps 50 others belong to faivata TWi n h ff? i ®\ wh ° em P lo y tlle m in carrying water to Manamah for sale.

It has been ascertained that there are in Bahrain about 100 vessels used for trade which run to Qatif, 'Oqair, Qatar, Trucial 'Oman and the Persian Coast, some of them even to India, Southern Arabia and Zanzibar; 917 which proceed to the pearl banks; 30 cargo lighters in Manamah harbour, of which half are BumsVSOO ferry-boats lying chiefly between Manamah and Muharraq Town ; and 600 fishing boats. The total of these figures is 1,947, clearly illustrating our statement as to partial convertibility. Manufactures and industries. —The leading handicrafts of Bahrain are sailmaking and the manufacture for local sale of woolen 'Abas, lungis both white and coloured, and checked sheeting. Matting is woven from fine Hasa reeds and is the best obtainable in the Persian Gulf. A new textile industry has recently sprung up in the manufacture of a striped cotton cloth from which Qabas and Zabuns are made, and the output of this material now amounts to about 100 pieces weekly. Bahrain is famous throughout the Persian Gulf for its boat building, and this industry gives employment to about 200 carpenters. In 1903-04 nearly 130 boats, ranging in price from Rs. 300 to Rs. 8,000, were sold to purchasers in Qatar and Trucial 'Oman. The timber and nails used in construction are chiefly from India. Foreign trade. —Bahrain is the principal pearl market of the Persian Gulf. It is also an emporium of general trade with the mainland of Arabia ; but its former function is the more important, and it is probable that, if the pearl beds were to fail, the Shaikh- dom would shortly be reduced to comparative insignificance. Imports are oyster sells and pearls from the neighbouring seas and coasts ; rice, cotton piece-goods, silk piece- goods, embroidery, spices, coffee, sugar, tea, coir-rope, timber, metals, hardware and haberdashery from India ; barley, wheat, ghi, carpets, rosebuds, rosewater, firewood, almonds, currants, gram, walnuts, live cattle, sheep and goats and some henna from Persia ; fruit and sweetmeats from the Sultanate of 'Oman ; 'Abas, dates, ghi and hides from Hasa; dates, fruits and some sheep and ghi from Qatif: ghi, sheep, a few 'Abas and a little wool from Kuwait; dates, ghi, mash, # wheat, barley, tobacco and coarse reed-mats for roofing from Turkish 'Iraq ; rafters and cocoanuts from East Africa. Of these the most important with their values (in lakhs of rupees) in 1905 were pearls (118), rice (26|), cotton piece-goods (9J), dates (9i), coffee (4J), wheat (4J), ghi (2f), sugar and tabocco (2| each), 'Abas (If), silk piece-goods (1^)? slaughter animals (1^) and timber and wood (1). The slaughter animals are chiefly sheep and goats imported periodically by about 15 Persian butchers from the Persian Coast; in 1905 no less than 14,000 sheep and goats were thus brought over from Persia and 2,050 from Qatif. An import of arms, worth 4 lakhs of rupees annually only a few years ago, has now entirely disappeared. The total value of the imports for 1905 was 243 lakhs, of which 103 lakhs were from India and 102 lakhs from 'Iraq. In the same year 65 steamers in cargo, all British and with an aggregate tonnage of 95,097, entered Manamah, the only steam port of Bahrain. The principal exports with their values (in lakhs of rupees) in 1905 were pearls (161), rice (6), cotton piece-goods (3f), dates (3i), and coffee (IJ). The pearls go chiefly to Bom bay ; the dates (of which some are dried and some, called Salaq, are boiled) to Karachi and the ports of Kathiawar. Oyster shells are sent to the United Kingdom, to Germany, and a few to France. Some sail cloth is exported, mostly to Basrah; fine reed matting is sent to Persia and Iraq ; arid a portion of the striped fabrics, already mentioned as locally manufactured, is disposed of in Hasa and Qatif. In 1905 the total value of exports from Bahrain was 204 lakhs of rupees, of which 129 lakhs worth went to India and 62 lakhs worth to 'Iraq. In the same year 35 steamers* cleared from Manamah with cargo ; all were British and they had a total tonnage of 54,666. It is calculated that about ^ of the total goods imported eventually leave the island again for various destinations ; and this at least is clear that the trade of Bahrain is largely a transit trade. In particular Manamah is the steam port for the Qatar promontory, for the Oases of Hasa and Qatif and, through Hasa, for port of Najd as well; the goods despatched to the mainland are chiefly piece-goods, rice, barley, metals, coffee, sugar and spices. About 50 horses per annum pass through Bahrain en route from Najd and Hasa to the Indian market. Until a few years ago donkeys also were largely exported from Bahraija . '^This does not mean that only half the steamers which called at Bahrain found cargo there. The explanatioa is that not all the steamers which call take out clearance certificates. 'BAHEAIN 359 to Persia ; but the diminution of their numbers, together with the rise of their price in the Bahrain islands, has brought about a cessation for the present of this trade. The trade with Qatar is divided between the towns of Manaqiah and Muharraq ; that with Hasa and Qatif is concentrated at Manamah. Currency, weights and measures. —The currency of the Bahrain principality is mixed. Indian coins of all denominations are the most popalar and circulate freely ; but Maria Theresa Dollars or Riyals are largely current during the pearl season, as the divers, who are mostly Arabs from the mainland, prefer them; and quantities are imported from Bombay to meet the demand. The Riyal is at present (1905) worth normally Re. 1 as. 5, but it is liable to fluctuations in value of as much as 1 or 2 annas either way. The Turkish Lirah passes at a valuation of Rs. 14. The ordinary unit of small values is however an imaginary coin called the Bahrain Qran which is worth 2-5ths of a rupee. The Tawilah of the Hasa Oasis is seen and is valued at J an anna, but it is not readily accepted. A large quantity of specie from abroad enters Bahrain. In 1903 the value of the coin imported was 43 lakhs of rupees, and coin worth 4 J lakhs is known to have left the islands in the same year. The ordinary weights of Bahrain are— Ruba' Mithqal •04 lb.

Of these only the Qabdhah, Dhira,' Ba' and Farsakh are known to ordinary illiterate people. The Dhira' is equivalent to 18f English inches. General administration. —The Government of Bahrain is of a loose and ill-organised character. It is ruled by a Shaikh—at present 'Isa-bin-'Ali—who, with the assistance of a Wazir or principal adviser, disposes of matters of political or general importance and personally governs, unless when absent on sporting expeditions to the mainland, the island of Muharraq and the part of Bahrain Island which is adjacent to Manamah. During four months in the hot weather the Shaikh has his seat at Manamah: his head quarters during the rest of the year are at Muharraq Town, but he indulges in frequent Journeys. A brother, sons, nephews and other near relations hold fiefs in various places, of which they have almost independent possession for life; upon these estates they collect taxes for their own behoof and exercise magisterial and seignorial jurisdiction. The most important semi-independent holding of this sort at the present time is in the hands of the Shaikh's brother Khalid; it includes the islands of Sitrah and Nabi Salih, as well as all the villages on the east side of Bahrain Island to the south of Khor-al- Kabb and the inland villages of Rifa'-ash-Sharqi and Rifa'-al-Gharbi. These fiefs are resumable at the death of the holder; in theory, at least, there is no obligation to con tinue them in favour of heirs. r360 BAHRAIN Class disabilities and priviliges. —Under the regime of the Shaikh and his relations the condition of the Baharinah, who form the bulk of the cultivating class in the princi pality, is unhappy. They are subject to a constant Sukhrah or corvee which affects their persons, their boats and their animals; their position in regard to the land is that of serfs rather than of tenants at will; and if they fail to deliver a certain amount of pro duce, which is often arbitrarily enhanced by the Shaikh's servants and relations, they are summarily evicted from their homes and in some cases are beaten and imprisoned as well. Some of the Baharinah are in theory landowners, having been allowed in the past to purchase gardens and obtain Sanads for the same; but their estates are often resumed for no valid reason : even the sons of the present ruler have been guilty of this injustice. The crops of the Baharinah are frequently stolen by the Bedouins who range the island, or are damaged by their animals. It does not appear that the Bahari nah are ever put to death without a regular trial by a Qadhi; but there is reason to suspect that deaths due to ill-treatment sometimes occur among them, and their women are apt to be molested by the Shaikh's servants. If oppressed beyond endurance the Baharinah might emigrate to the QatTf Oasis, and a consciousness of this possibility is the principal check upon the inhumanity of their masters. The position of the Dawasir of Budiya' and Zallaq is somewhat peculiar. With their neighbours the Baharinah they have little to do ; and their relations with the Shaikh of Bahrain are distant though not unfriendly. They insist on being dealt with through their own chiefs, and they have given the Shaikh of Bahrain clearly to understand that, if he should take any action affecting them of which they disapprove, they will ouit Bahrain in a body. It is considered, however, that the extensive purchases of date plantations which four or five of their headmen have made of late years in the vicinity of their settlements now render this threat difficult, if not impossible, of fulfilment. The Bedouins, chiefly Na'im, of whose presence the islands are never free and whose number reaches its maximum in the hot weather, are a cause of much trouble and annoy ance to the settled inhabitants ; but they are patronised and encouraged by the Shaikh from an idea, probably erroneous, that they would rally to his side in an emergency. Religious and legal institutions* —The Shaikh of Bahrain and his family and tribe are Sunnis, and the Sunni form of Islam consequently enjoys, as it were, official recognition and preference. Serious cases of a criminal nature and important cases of civil law not relating to mercantile transactions or to the peatl fisheries are referred by the Shaikh to an official chief Qadhi—at present Jasim-bin-Mahza' of Manamah—who is a Sunni; and, provided that the whole of the parties are Bahrain subjects, the fact that some of them may be Shi'ahs does not affect the established procedure in this respect. Minor cases, especially those of a civil character, are sent for settlement, if both parties are Sunnis, to Shaikh Sharaf-bin-Ahmad of Muharraq, Sunni; and, if both parties are Shi'ahs, to Shaikh Ahmad-bin-Hurz of Manamah, Shi 'ah: to this extent the right of Shi'ahs to have their cases disposed of by co-religionists is recognised. The secular arm is brought into play by the Shaikh to enforce the findings, on the criminal side, of these various judges ; the latter, unfortunately, are reported to discharge their functions 44 with the maximum of injustice '.f Besides the legal experts whose names have just been mentioned, there are at the present time in Bahrain 7 other Sunni Qadhis and 2 Qadhis of the ShT'ah persuasion who are permitted by the Shaikh to adjudicate on cases which the contesting parties may agree to refer to them. It is believed that, in criminal matters, the headmen of Sunni tribes other than those residing in the towns of Mana mah and Muharraq wield considerable magisterial powers ; and it is probable that landowners of the Shaikh's family and their agents exercise a similar authority in regard to the agricultural Baharinah. It is understood that the Baharinah, who, as we have seen, are not generally landowners, are accustomed to submit their matri monial cases and petty disputes about moveable property for settlement to their village Mullas. Mercantile cases, especially those in which foreigners are concerned, are decided by a tribunal J called variously the Majlis-al-'Urfi or Majlis-at-Tijarah, that is the head* 1116 ■^ 0re ^ n i&gt;rocee(iin S s the Government of India for April 1901 contain some information under thia _ tSince the political crisis of February 1905 the administration of justice in Bahrain has somewhat improved toreginers' 110110n sll ^J ec ^ 18 growing more powerfu!, iargely in consequence of a steady influx of ^otected t Regarding the Majlis, etc., see letters from Major P.

This body, of which the permanent members are nominated by the Shaikh in consultation with the British Political Agent, possibly had its origin in arrangements made long since for settling by arbitration claims which arose between British subjects and persons amenable to the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrain ;* but it has now existed for at least 50 years, and has come to be regarded as the only authority in the islands competent to settle mercantile suits. In practice such suits, if both parties are Bahrain subjects and the dispute is one of fact only; are often irregularly settled by the relations or servants of the Shaikh; but all questions of principle, by which the interests of foreigners might afterwards be affected, are referred to the Majlis for decision, and the Shaikh admits a moral obliga tion to make use of the Majlis on all suitable occasions. When one or more of the parties to a case is a British subject, or when none of the parties are Bahrain subjects, the Majlis is ordinarily convoked by the British Political Agent and sits at the British Political Agency, but a representative of the Shaikh is allowed to be present, and his presence is occasionally requested by one of the parties l , the finding in such circumstances becomes operative only after it has been approved by the British Political Agent. Cases arising out of pearl diving operations or the pearl trade are determined by a board of arbitration, known as the Salifat-al-Ghaus, of which the constitution and powers are described in another place.f Judicial fees (called Khidmah) are levied, sometimes by the Qadhis, sometimes by the Amirs or Bazaar Masters of the Manamah and Muharraq towers, and sometimes (particularly in large cases) by the Shaikh himself. In small cases the plaintiff gene rally pays Khidmah on the amount of his decree ; but ^ometime^ he is Made to pay 10 per cent, on the amount of his claim, even if he does not obtain a decree in full. If the plaintiff loses his case Khidmah is not taken, unless it had been recovered in ad- Vance. In large cases the Shaikh is careful always to take Khidmah in advance. Finance. J—The budget of the Bahrain principality is, at the present time, in rough outline, as follows § :—* Receipts. Expenditure. Rs. Rs t Sea customs .. 1,50,000 Personal expenses Of the 1,00,000 Shaikh (including salaries of bodyguard). Agricultural dues {viz.&gt; the pro- 1,00,000 duce of state gardens and a tax called Nob on the gardens of Special expenses (in connec 30,000 private individuals from whom tion with marriages, journeys it can be collected). etc.).

It will be observed that the above is the budget of the Shaikh of Bahrain alone, and that the column of receipts does not include the amounts which are wrung by fief- holders of_the Shaikh's family from the villages situated In their estates. poll tax: called Taraz is among the additional imposts to which the agricultural Baharinah are at times subjected. In the Sunni villages as a rule, and especially in those where one tribe largely predominates^ there is either no taxation at'all or the proceeds go to the tribal chief instead of to the Shaikh Bahrain or member^ of his family* Military and naval resources.—AMogGhev the Shaikh of Bahrain and his principal relations and servants maintain about 540 armed men, distributed somewhat as follows-^ Shaikh 'Isa-bin-^AIi, Shaikh of I Shaikh Khalid, brother of 'Isa Shaikh Hamad, son of 'Isa Shaikh Muhammad, son of 'Isa Shaikh 'Abdullah,, son of 'Isa,., The Bazaar Master of Manamah The Bazaar Master of Muharrag Of this force about 200 men are armed with rifles, bu't the remainder,, if they possess firearms at all, have only matchlocks ; all, however-^ carry swords. For the defence of his dominions from foreign aggression, however, and for the maintenance of order within, the Shaikh depends not so much on these retainers as on the Na'im tribe, of whom he professes to have large numbers at call. In point of fact the Na'im of Bahrain and Qatar only amount to about 400 fighting men all told, and of these more than half are generally absent in Qatar, while not more than 100 out of the whole number are mounted. The Shaikh, as already mentioned, has a small but excellent stud of Arab mares, and he and his family own about 100 riding camels* Till lately he possessed several fast-sailing but unarmed Batils, of which 2 or 3 were* ordinarily placed at the disposal of the customs contractors for the prevention of smug- gling ; these, however, have now disappeared, and when the Shaikh requires a boat he takes one by Sukhrah. Political position and foreign interests.—VhQ t-eaty relations of the Shaikh of Bahrain are exclusively with the Indian Government, who maintain at Manamah, as their local representative, a European officer of their Political Department having the local rank of Agent: this Agent is subordinate to the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The maintenance of a charitable medical dispensary, built by local contributions and known as the Victoria Memorial Hospital, was undertaken by the Government of India from 1905, and the institution itself has been attached to the Political Agency. There is also a British post office connected with the Agency* British subjects ordinarily resident fn Bahrain at the present time, inclusive of officials but exclusive of an Indian military guard for the Agency, are : European British subjects^ 2 ;■ Eurasians, 4 Native Christians, 2 ; Hindus, 69 ; Muhammadans, 122; Jews, 5. In the hot weather the number of Hindus under British protection rises to about 175, and that of Muhammadans to 150, One British mercantile firm and 2 British steamship com panies are represented in the islands,- and there are 22 resident Hindu and 11 resident Muhammadan traders who are under British protection. After the political and commercial interests of Britain in Bahrain, the interests of the United States, arising from a mission of the Reformed (Dutch) Church of America, are the most important; this mission, which is at Manamah, was founded in I$93. Of more recent origin, and less- extensive/ are the German Interests represented by a eommercial firm. J ^ Geographical. The name Baliaram &amp; applied to the archipelago lying in the Gulf which separates the Turkish districts of Hasa snd Qatif from the promontory of Qatr, generally also to the largest island of the group formerly called Awai The chief islands of the group Bahrain. * TckPAL 200 100 80 30 30 50 50 5401 BAHRAIN 363'. ^ Muharraq, Sitrah, Nabi Saleh and Umm Na'asan, the last of which is un- inhabited. There are besides a number of lesser islets and rocks, which, with a muss of reels and shoals, some of which are uncovered at low tide, render th^ navigation of the Hat ^ Bahrain extremely difficult. From the military point of view only the islands oi Muharraq and Bahrain are worthy of consideration. | Muharraq, on which the Shaikh and his family reside, 'except from (July to October, when^they go to Manamah in Bahrain, is a small flat island about 4 miles by 1 lying about Ig- miles to the north-east of Bahrain, from which it is separated by shoal water with a narrow and shallow channel. There are on Muharraq, besides the town of Mu harraq (20,000) and Hidd (8,000), 11 villages with a total population of about 11,000. The largest island of the group, Bahrain, is 30 miles long from north to south, and 10 males broad along, the northern Coast. Its area is 208 square miles, of which 18 square males, chiefly in the north, is cultivated. A shallow inlet, the Khor-al-Khaab, pene trates the island from the east almost to the centre. Bahrain is flat and low, but the ground rises gradually from all sides to the centre. Where a plateau of from 100 to 200 feet above sea leavel is formed. In the centre of this plateau is a narrow degression of about 13 miles long from which rises the highest hill in the islands, Jabal-al-Dukhan (440). Besides the town of Manamah (26,000) and Budaiya' (8,000) there are in Bahrain- island 83 villages with a population of about 27,000. The total population of the group of islands is over 110,000, and rises in the pearl season to over 120,000.

The faghest temperature registered being 109 and the lowest 36. In 1914 the lowest tempe rature was 52. Owing to the extreme humidity of the atmosphere which sometimes attains 82 per cent, of saturation, both extremes are trying. The rainfall averages just tinder 3| inches and is spread over the winter but the dew iB extremely heavy and persists throughout the year. The prevailing wind, the shamal, blows from the north -north-west and seldom shifts found to the north. This wind blows off and 011 throughout the year, and is frequently of great violence in the winter months, causing damage to sailing craft and even to build- fngs. A shamal generally blows for forty days from the second week in June, but is not so violent then as in the winter months. The qaus or south-east wind blows occa sionally during the winter,- sprmg and early summer. Coming as it does from over the Arabian desert the tfaus in early summer is like a blast from a furance. It occasionally brings so thick a dust haze as to cause an impediment to navigation. January and February are damp, cold and windy,- The temperature then rises rapid ly till the June shamal commences. In a favourable season the climate is quite pleasant as long as the shamal lasts ; in its breaks and after it ceases till the middle of October the climate is hot and very moist with little relief at night. There are generally hot moist dlays even in November. The climate in D^ecember is sometimes quite pleasant. There is no attempt at sanitation in Bahrain and the inhabitants are particularly shameless in this matter. All eye diseases are very prevalent, and blindness is common among even the richer people, but especially so among the divers. Malaria is very pre valent from October till the beginning of the June shamal. The inhabitants of the date groves are forced to 1 abandon them in the former month owing to the plague of mosqui- Most of these, however, are not of the malaria bearing varieties. Bowel complaints are very common, especially among foreigners, owing to the brackish nature of the drink ing water and the swarms of flies. Plague visited the islands in 1905, 1907, 1909, 1911 and 1914. The Victoria Memorial Hospital under an Assistant Surgeon is maintained by tli© 3A2BAHRAIN Indian Governmentand there is also an American Mission Hospital. The Shaikh employs a Parsi doctor as Quarantine Medical Officer. Ethnography. % The indigenous inhabitants of the Bahrain islands consist of the descendants of various Arab tribes with a varying admixture of Persian and negro blood. The Bahrainis, who are Shi'ahs and cultivators, are the most numerous ; they number over 40,000, but are a depressed race, and have no political power. They are also employed as divers. ^ The Huwalah, a similar Sunni community, number about 18,000; they chiefly inhabit the towns. The only tribes properly so called are the 'Utub, Sadah and Dowasir (plural of Dosiri). The 'Utub, as being the tribe of the ruling family, are treated with respect, but they have little real influence. The Dowasir, whose headquarters are at Budaiya', ten miles west of Manamah are capable of bringing pressure to bear on the Shaikh, and have fre quently done so in the last ten years. They are an offshoot of the Dowasir of Najd, one of the most important tribes of that country, and have sent offshoots to the Persian coast. While themselves jealous of any control by the Shaikh of Bahrain, they are the staunchest upholders of his independence. They number about 5,000. There are also in the islands about 12,000 negroes, known as Sidis, of whom about 5,000 are still in servitude, generally as divers. The foreign population fluctuates according to the season. In a good year in the pearling season, i.e., from May to October, there are about 8,000 foreigners including Hindu, Borah, Persian-and Baghdad Jew merchants with coolies and divers from Turkish Arabia, Persia, the Arabian Coast, Aden, Somaliand and even Zanzibar. Eesources. Dates and a very few vegetable, bananas, figs and limes, all of a very low quality, are all the foodstuffs produced in the islands. Bahrain is, however, a great distributing centre for both sides of the Gulf, and Indian, Persian and Arab merchants do a large trade in rice, tea, coffea, sugar and vermi celli. The import of rice amounts to as much as 15,000 tons in a year, the greater part of it being re-exported to Arabia. Owing to the high import duties imposed in Persia much tea and sugar is smuggled in from Bahrain. £35,000 worth of tea alone was successfully disposed of in this manner in 1913-14. Wheat comes from Persia and Turkish Arabia, while all other foodstuffs are imported through Indian ports. Sheep are imported, but in small quantities owing to the scarcity of fodder, from both sides of the Gulf, and the f6w cattle that are killed come from Persia. Kice is the only article which Bahrain can be relied upon to supply in any quantities at short notice, as the markets in other articles are so uncertain that merchants do not keep large stocks. For other supplies for troops it would be advisable to rely on marine transport from India for at least a month so as to allow for contracts being made with the local merchants, but it would probably be found preferable to ration troops entirely from India. When the Indian Expeditionary Force was anchored off Bahrain in 1914 less than 100 sheep were obtained from the Arabian Coast at ten days notice, but the price was such that it would have paid to have got them from Karachi and less delay would have been involved. There was no difficulty in supplying 500 lbs. of fish a day and a larger supply could be arranged for. Little milk is drunk in Bahrain and fodder for cows has to be imported. Of other supplies, firewood is imported from Persia and India. 1,000 maunds could be obtained from Persia in ten days at a cheaper rate than it could be imported from India. The local supply available at short notice would seldom fall below 500 maunds. Small hardwood bulks are imported from India, Persia and Zanzibar. They are extensively used for building, and a supply of 1,000 can be relied on without notice. Owing to the large boat building industry a considerable supply of planks is also avail able, sufficient at any rate for the construction of all jetties which are likely to be re quired. Palm trees which are used for bridging the narrow water cuts are obtainable in any quantity.BAHEAIN 365 Large amounts of palm and palmetto matting are imported for hut making in which the inhabitants excel. It would be possible at comparatively short notice to hut a Division. Grass, hay and bhusa are imported, but a considerable quantity of lucerne is grown in Bahrain. As the local produce of this is consumed by the large number of donkeys in the islands and the few sheep that are imported for fattening, the supply for even 100 horses would send the price up. Oil is obtained from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Muhammerah, who have an agent in Bahrain. There are shows of oil in Bahrain, but they have not been worked. There is no coal to be obtained locally and none is imported. Besides Messrs. Gray, Paul's the only European firm is a German one, Messrs. R. Wonckhaus; Agents of the Hamburg-Amerika Line. Their Agent is now a Prisoner of War in India and the branch is closed. Messrs Gray, Paul's, who are Agents and landing contractors of the British India Steam Navigation Company, are comission agents and do not keep a large stocks of any thing. Hindu, Arab and Persian merchants handle nearly all the import and export trade. Indian money forms the currency. The Turkish lira is also current at Rs. 14 to 13-8-0,' and the Maria Theresa dollar or rial at 1-6 to 1-4. The Persian double kran is also exchangeable.

The chief occupation of Bahrain is pearl fishing ; some 35,000 persons and over 1,200 boats are employed on the banks, the majority coming from Bahrain. Nearly all the Arab and Hindu merchants deal in pearls, and European buyers come to Manamah for the season. The only other industry is boat building. The Bahrain builders can turn out an excellent 40-ton boat in less than a month. Iron work, sail cloth and hempen rope are imported from India. Fibre rope is made locally. Fighting Men. The number of men capable of bearing arms varies very considerably not only with the season, but with each year. The greatest number are present immediately before the pearl fishing commences, during its break, and from the end of the fishing till accounts are made up, i.e., in April, in Ramzan, if it comes in the summer, and for October and November. By the middle of December Bahrain is at its emptiest. The fluctuating population consists of divers and ' pullers ' from Persia, Turkish Arabia, Kuwait and the Arabian Coast with a few men even from Aden, Somaliland and Zanzibar. From April to December also a varying number of porters from Basrah and Kurdistan work in Manamah. These foreigners provide nearly all the crime in the islands. It may be taken that practically the whole of the outside population is unarmed. The indigenous population is unwarlike, and has a very wholesome dread of ships' guns. It is unlikely that there are more than 12,000 men of military age among them. The Shaikh and his family are supposed to keep up about 500 armed retainers, but most of these are more familar with a coffee pot than a rifle, and in the past the Bahrain Shaikhs have always relied for their main fighting strength on tribes from the mainland. The present Shaikh keeps some of these attached to him by subsidies. The estimates of modern rifles in the islands vary from 300 to 800. The lowest figure . is probably not far wide of the mark, and the majority of these are not in good condition owing to the dampness of the climate and the laziness of the owners. There are not half a dozen men in the islands with any idea of using a rifle at over 300 yards. It is also improbable that there are 500 rounds per rifle in the islands. It must, however, be remembered that owing to the long uninhabited coast line, the supply of fighting _men rifles and ammunition might be largely increased at very short notice.366 BAHRAIN' There are probably 500 or more pistols in Bahrain. The Shaikh owns some 6 rusty old signalling guns. Ports. Bahrain can hardly be called a port. The usual anchorage is abotit U miles W of Man amah. Ships drawing 18 feet and over anchor about three miles out. The inner anchorage is merely a ' hole ' in which there is room for two ships of the size of the smaller British India Gulf mail steamers at a tima. At the outer anchorage shins usually anchor in a single line. 0 r la 1901 a light draught man-of-war anohorsd between Muharraq and Qasabiva. commanding both Muharraq aul Manamah at short range. The prevailing wind, the shamal, blows dead on shore from the anchorage ' but th©' shoals to the North prevent the sea from getting up dangerously. No case*} are'on record ot steamers having had to clear out owing to high winds. The beach shelves very gradually and is of mud interspersed with coral rock At low springs the tide go3S out 270 yards leaving the Customs' pier and the Ao-encv jetty dry. A coral reef marked by a beacon runs from a point 5 cables' length south- east of the inner anchorage in a north-easterly direction right round Muharraq. It is- bare for the greater part of its length at low tide. This reef is clear of the course of boats from bath anchorages to the Customs' pier • but, except at high tides, boats for the Agency jetty, Muharraq and the Qasabiya land ing places have to round the beacon before turning east. There are no dangerous currents and tides do not run strong enough to interfere with the landing of troops to any extent, but at some tides there is difficulty in bringing the awkward local boats along side ships. 0 The British India company employ a few men who act as pilots to their vessels. At least 200 of the local boatmen are capable of acting as pilots for sailing boats to the various landing places, but most of these men are absent during the pearling season. There is no harbour master and no civilized harbour arrangements. The Political Agent has a 60-ton steam launch, but, as it draws 6 feet, it would not be of much use for towing boats except at high tide. * Landing arrangements. Regular arrangements for landing cargo were instituted in 1914; and Messrs. Gray Paul and Company are landing contractors for the British India Steam Navigation Company, whose steamers are the most numerous of those visiting Bahrain. They have ten large boats of a capacity of 40 tons of cargo drawinp- from 6^ to 8 feet which are always kept manned. Besides Messrs. Gray, Paul's there are a very lar^e number of similar boats and smaller boats known locally as ' jolly boats ' (Arabic plural 44 jawali bit') quite sufficient for the landing of troops from as many transports as could be assembled at the outer anchorage. When the pearling fleet is at sea it would how- ever, be impossible to man more than 20 or 30 of these, and that with the less expert boatmen. The beach, as has been said, shelves very gradually, and the presence of the reef in front of Manamah prevents boats from coming right in except opposite the Customs pier. Here at low springs not even jolly boats can discharge at the pier, but the boat men are accustomed to bring the boats in as fear as they can and discharge cargo on to- donkeys. The Customs pier is 180 yards long, and narrows from 85 to 33 feet in breadth. There is_7 feet of water alongside for the greater part of its length at high tide. The Agency jetty, 200 yards long by 5 feet wide, is less favourably placed owing to the shallow' channel in front of it. The whole of the beach in between'the Customs and Agency is available for beaching boats at low tide, and at high tide boats can come alongside Messrs. Gray, Paul's wal£ about half way in between, but the extreme narrowness of the streets of the bazaar- constitutes a serious obstacle, and it is not till the Agency is reached that there is a clear way to the camping grounds behind the town. It must be noted that men wading ashore are apt to cut their feet in the coral, an(J that as the mud of the beach is very foul, blood poisoning usually ensues. Pace for store depots is also very restricted at the Customs House. Near the Agency jV. B. For further information see Persian Gulf Pilot, the new edition of which is now being compiled.BAHRAIN 367 tliere is sufficient open space for the store depots of a Brigade, but this will probably soon be built over. Besides the actual frontage dealt with above the next place comparatively suitable for landing is at the open beach at Qasabiya {vide n Camping sites '). Here the beach does not shelve quite so gradually and is of firm Sand. The disadvantages of this landing place are;— The narrow, shallow and tortuous channel from the anchorage and the fact that it is hidden from the anchorage, and that there would be some difficulty in arranging for an intermediate signalling station visibile both from the transports and from the landing place. ® On the Whole, provided the Qasabiya site be Selected for the camp, the best plan would probably be to use all three landing places, the Customs pier for horses, mules and men, the Agency jetty for men and some stores. Such heavy stofeg as are not wanted immediately could be sent round to Qasabiya and the boats beached at high tide. For stores liable to damage small temporary wooden Jetties could be speedily constructed from local material. As has been shown, the shallowness of the water is a great obstacle to the rapid disem barkation or embarkation of troops; but a Still greater objection to the use of Bahrain as a temporary baSe is the sfiamal. This, the prevailing wind, blows dead on shore from the anchorage. When it is blowing with any strength boats take from U to 4 hours sailing off, and consequently generally miss a tide. As it generally blcrws for four days or longer in the winter-, and for 40 in the Summer, great delay in re-embarkation must be allowed for. i None of the landing places are commanded by high ground, but cover from houses and walls is afforded along the whole front. A milled Portuguese fort i^ sitnatM ™ the beach about 3 miles west of Manamah. Camping sites* Immediately behind Manamah lies an extensive plain extending the whole length of the town and continuing to the eastern coast of the island. Behind the town itSelf it is narrow, fouled by the insanitary habits of the people and, from September on^ rendered almost uninhabitable by mosquitoes. During the Summer months, when the mosquito plague,has abated, it is largely occupied by the pahn leaf huts of the Shaikh's sons and theii- followers, who collect round the bhaikh s mud fort during his residence there. The eastern end of the plain at Qasabiya i« more Suitable for a camping ground for troops. Here there is room for a Division. The soil is heavy white sand mixed with shells which does not rise to any extent in a wind. It is also porous and allows fam water to percolate through very rapidly. At Some spots the sub-soil water is met with 3 feet down. This Site is said to be the least moSquito-fidden in the northern or inhabited part of the island. ^ The quarantine station is at one end of the Site, and a part of the beach is occupied by palm huts during the Summed. * No part of this plain is commanded by high ground. Should Bahrain be occupied by troops for any length of time and rapid re-embark* ation not be a sine qua non Several sites could be found at a distance of from 7 to 9 miles inland within reach of the Adarl water Supply. This location would probably be found to be more healthy than the sites nearer the town* Water. The quality of the water of the island is a serious factor. Owing to the Scttnfv rain. f%ll and the flat nature of the ground, the only water is that from springs. The^e springs are supposed to come from Central Arabia. As the water has thus travelled s^mo hundred miles underground it is probably organically pure ; but is impregnated wHh salts m varying degrees in each spring. wilii The Gasari springs about 2 miles and the Adari about 3J from Manama are the mort copious. Between them they irrigated some square miles of paL ^ and cenie Manama is clne^y supplied from Gasari, iuterne.368 BAHRAIN' The Um ush Shum spring near Qasabiya is sufficient for a Brigade camped at that place. If necessary, transport animals could be watered at cuts from Gasari which reach to within a mile of Qasabiya. There are also submarine springs in the sea between Qasabiya and Muharraq, and springs in the small islands in the vicinity, such as Saya near the anchorage. The popula tion of the large town of Muharraq uses a submarine spring, the water being collected in skins at a depth of from 2 to 9 feet below the surface. The only really good water in the islands is got from some deep wells at Haneni, some 8 miles away from Manamah. The supply is very limited. Europeans generally obtain drinking water from the mail steamers, though the mem bers of the American Mission drink spring water and soon become acclimatized. A dmin ist ration. Bahrain is not a British Protectorate, but is under British protection. The Shaikh; who has certain engagements with us regarding slavery, piracy and the arms traffic, has handed over the administration over all foreigners to the British Government. He, as will be seen from the Historical section, owes the Chiefship entirely to us. Many times also have we prevented his relations from ejecting him. He is jealous of a show of independence, and through listening to evil advisers has often shown himself very obstructive ; but he is honourable and loyal. The law of the country is Sha'ara, and most cases between Bahrain subjects are tried by the Sunni or Shi'ah Qazis. The Amirs of Muharraq and Manamah are respon sible for order in those towns and try petty cases. The people are as a rule docile and well behaved, and very little crime is committed except by the Kurds and Basris. All cases in which foreigners are concerned are tried by the Political Agent, who sometimes makes use, in commercial cases, of the ' Majlis-ul-Urf' or of the Qazis. Communications. The British India Steam Navigation Company runs a weekly up steamer and a fortnightly down. This was, however, reduced to an irregular fortnightly service at the commencement of the war. Occasional steamers of the Hamburg-Amerika line (8 in 1914) called before the war, and the Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company and Arab steamships also send an occasional ship. The lines running direct from England to the Gulf do not call at Bahrain, There is frequent communication with the Persian and Arabian Coasts by sailing boat. There is no telegraph cable to Bahrain. A wireless installation has been erected. There is a British Indian Post Office at Manamah, at which Indian rates probably about 100 5 they are all imported and belong mostly to the Shaikh and his family. There are no made roads in the islands, and the only wheeled transport consists of a few water carts and private carriages. The local building stone is of coral formation and is not suitable for road making, but the surface of the ground is hard over the greater part of the island. No census has been taken of the camels in Bahrain, but there are probably about 100 ; they are all imported and belong mostly to the Shaikh and his family. The local breed of donkeys is an excellent one. Some two hundred could be obtain ed at short notice. They are extensively used for landing cargo. A good riding donkey mare fetches any sum over 150 and up to as much as 1,200. There are probably not a hundred horses in Bahrain ; they are all the property of the Shaikhs. Bahrain Notables.

BAI'AH ( or Bi'ah)— A village on the coast of the Ruus-al-Jibal District in the 'OmSn Sultanate; the mountains rise behind it at a distance of about 1J miles. It consists of about 450 houses of Shihuh, nearly all of the Bani Shatair, but a few of the Bani Hadlyah section, and is situated in Dibah bay about 1 mile north of Hisn-ad-Dibah or Dibah proper, but it is sometimes regarded as a part of Dibah. From the sea the two places appear to form one town with a background of date palms, but in reality they are separated by a water course up which the sea runs for about 200 yards. The inhabitants live by date-cultiva tion and fishing and own about 14 sea-going Sambuks which carry dates and fish to Masqat Town and places in the Persian Gulf. A little wheat, barley, and sweet potatoa is grown both in the date gardens and behind the town, and dates are exported. There is one provision shop kept by a Persian.

It is on the eastern slopes of the Hejaz coastal range. According to Doughty, Baidha, which is ' one natural day's journey from the sea- town (Al Wajj), ' is a ruined site with dom, or branched wild nut palms. There is also a standing hamlet of tents of Billi who own a few palm trees. BAIDHA— A village 38 miles south-west of Mecca, on the Lith-Mecca route. BAIDHA— See 'Umr-al-Gharbi (Wadi Bani).

The wells contain brackish water at 4 to 9 fathoms. The watering rights of Baidha Nathil apparently belong to the Bishr Arabs* {Doughty.) Baidha Nathil is about 3 miles north-west of Munsaf, and consists of a few huts of Masa'idah Ataibah, Some cereals are grown but no dates. BAIDHAH— A town in the Amudi tribal district, in Hadhramaut, and situated on the left bank of the Wadi Do an, about 10 miles north-north-east of J£huraibah.

The island thus formed is known as Siniyah and belongs to the Umm-al-Qaiwain Principality: it has no date trees but contains the ruins of two deserted villages, namely Mallah at the north-east end, where there is an unoccupied fort belong ing to the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain, and Siniyah at the south-eastern extremity, where an old mosque may be seen. It is said that scarcity of water obliged the inhabit ants to migrate to Umm-al-Qaiwain Town, The Shaikh of Umm-al-Qaiwain sometimes goes hawking on the island, BAIDHATAIN— See Aja, BAIDI— A camping site in the Herrat Khaibar, north-western Najd, and regarded by the Arabs as a natural wonder.

They are crossed by travellers journeying between the Dead Sea and Tayma, the better known amongst the others being Wadi Hasa and Wadi Hidrij. They are deep-sided watercours es, and contain a considerable amount of vegetation, tamarisk, and thorn scrub. In these dry water-channels are piled up heaps of dead wood and old trees washed down by sudden floods. In Wadi Hidrij, which is roughly 120 miles south-east of the Dead Sea, there are ostriches, this being probably their northerly limit. In the upp;)r part of Wadi Bair, at a point about 65 miles east-north-east of the oasis of Ma'an, are some wells containing excellent water at 40 feet. Bair is one of the summer ing places of the Bani Sakhr : the wells provide ample water for a large number of men and animals and the deep velley supplies at all times of the year sufficient pasturage. At these wells are the remains of a large khan or caravansarai which for architectural reasons may be dated in the Umayyad period. It was no doubt a stage on the Umayyad road mentioned by Muqaddasi as running fom Tayma to Damascus and may without question be identified with the stage called by him Wubayr. In Muqaddasi's day the route had already fa len into disuse. Close to these ruins is the tomb of the Jidd, or forbear, of the Bani Sakhr, a place regarded by them as of great sanctity, and a camel is sacrificed by any shaikh of the Bini Sakhr camping in the valley.— {Carruthers, January-February 1909; Miss. G. L. Bell, Jarmary 1914.) 1SAIRAM 'ALI (J ub-i)— One of the numerous small waterways on the Persian frontier and draining from the Pusht-i-Kuh range towards the marshes north of Kut-al-Amarah. At certain seasons of the year this waterway is dry. BAIT (Q abr)— A tomb in the Amadi tribal district ia Hadhramawt, 1- ing a few miles south-east of Kurbaida 1 !. The place consists of 4 little houses and 13 wells.— [Wrede -y 1843.) BAIT-AL- 'AINAIN— See Sanaisal (Wadi). BAIT-AL-FALAJ— There are three main wells of which one is in the fort, another just north of it, and the third 300 yards north of it. There are also two springs 300 yards north-east of the fort, Ijoth being worked y hand pumps, as also is the well in the fort. The water supply is ample (even for a brigade and very good). In addition to Bait-al-Falaj itself, which is a large defensible house belonging to the Sultan of Masqat, there is a small cluster of huts 200 yards north-north-east of it, which liowever are now deserted. Adjoining Bait-al-Falaj is a patch of ground about 100 yards square which is cultivated by the British garrison as a vegetable garden. Another patch surrounds well no. 3 and is J of an acre in extent. * Bait-al-Falaj is 1| miles from Matrah by a good track, and 3 miles from the British Agency in Masqat as the crow flies. The track to Masqat is impassable for animals, the usual way of going there being by boat from Matrah, the journey taking about | an hour. There are no supplies or livestock at Bait-al-Falaj other than those maintained by the British garrison there. The latter now consists of one battalion of Indian Infantry. On January 11th a body of about 3,000 rebels attacked the outpost line here, but were defeated with heavy loss.— {Murphy.) BAIT-AL-FALAJ (W adi)— A very short valley in fho Masqat district of the 'Oman Sultanate ; it begins 3 or 4 miles south and a little west of Masqat town, runs 3J miles to the north-west and then turns due north reaching the sea at DSrsait, 1^ miles from Bait-al-Falaj. The only placesBAI-BAI 873 in this wadi are Darsait at its mouth and Bait-al-Falaj, from which it takes its name, 1| miles from the sea. Ruwi is close to the left bank of Wadi Bait-al-Falaj at a point 8 4 miles from the sea; but its lands mostly drain to Wadi'Adai, in which we have included it. Bait-al-Falaj village is U miles from Matrah town ; its main feature (and raison d'etre) is a large fortified residence of the Sultan of 'Oman, who comes to live here in the hot weather. There are young date plantations watered by falajs from the wddi, Saih-al- Harmal, and Ruwi. A village has sprung up on the north-east side of the fort; it con tains some stone houses and a considerable number of less substantial buidings, about 30 in all. The inhabitants are 'Awamir and are mostly connected with the Harrison ; they possess 60 camels, 30 donkeys, 70 cattle, and 200 sheep and goats. The situation of Bait- al-Falaj, which overlooks the stony plain called Saih-al-Harmal, is open and airv for this district and there is convenient access to the sea both at Darsait and at Matrah f with the latter Bait-al-Falaj is connected by a road running through a natural opening in the hills which is called Kharashif. There is a line of falajs leading from Ruwi to Bait-al-Falaj, and a running stream of excellent water passes under the Sultan's house and on to the village. There are also wells close by. The Sultan's house was used as headquarters by the detachments of native infantry sent to assist the Sultan of Masqat in July 1913. A telephone line connecting the Sultan's house at Masqat with Sib, passes within 150 yards of the house.—{Persian Gulf Gazetteer ; Murphy.) There is now a good cart road connecting Bait-al-Falaj with Matrah and also with Sidab. BAIT-AL-FAQIH— A town in the Yemen Tihamah, situated about 30 miles south-west of Hod idah. The population is about 5,000 souls, but was greater when the town was a centre of the coffee trade. It is garrisoned normally by a battalion, designed to overawe the Zaranik tribe whose contumacious independence has ruined the town's trade. It was, like Zabid, formerly also a centre of cotton and indigo production and of the weaving and dyeing industry. Ba t-al-Faqih is situated in a plain and is irregularly built of sun-dried bricks, and can lay little claim either to importance or interest. It possesses three or four good houses, two mosques, and a plentiful water-supply. Bait-al-Faqih is the place of burial of one Saiyid Ahmad-ibn-Musa whose tomb is still an object of reverence and pilgrimage. Niebuhr remarks that the surrounding country being sandy and sterile does not allow of much cultivation ; it was, however, at that time covered with thorn bushes and those kinds of plants which are utilised as roofing for the houses in the Tihamah. He estimated the population of Bait-al-Faq'h then at 3,000 inhabitants. —{Niebuhr, March and Aprils 1763, Manzoni, 1877-8 ; Harris.) There is a village of the same name distinguished as Al-KabTr, and equidistant from Hodaidah to the north, on the Lahiyah road.— {Handbook of Yemen.)

Bajil is situated in rich agricultural district, and one of the few yielding a fairly regular asliur, or land tax. Supplies are readily obtain able and consist of millet, sesame, and other grain, fodder, fuel, livestock, poultry, and eggs. The town is administrared by a Tirkish Kaimakam whose district begins just outside Hodeida, includes Obal, and extends north to Jabal Malhan.

It is the first halting-place on the road from Makalla to Shibham, and possesses wells, some palm trees, and a bungalow belonging to the Sultan of Makalla. Between Makalla and Bakhrain the country is arid waste, except just outside the town where the road traverses a valley called the ' Beginning of Light ' in which by the help of irrigation, bananas and cocoanut trees flourish.— {Bent; December, 1893.)

BAKR (Abu)— About five generations ago, the chief Arab family in the Hadhramawt, who claimed descent from the first of the Khalifs. Daring one of their feuds with the local Bedouiens the Abu Bikr sought the assistance of some of the chiefs of the Yafa'i tribe who lived to the north-east of Aden. To this request the Al-Ka'aiti family responded, and enabled the Abu Bakr to drive out the Bedouins and to restore p3ace and order.— [Bent, 1894,) BAKR (Bani)— See 'Adi (Bani). BAKR (Jabal)— A hill about 12 miles north-east from the head of the Gulf of 'Aqabah, on one of the routes between there and Ma'an. It is the highest of the granite bergs encumbering the Wadi Yetm (or Lithm) and is near the ancient dam of A1 Masadd (As-Sidd) which stretches right across the valley. Upon it is a stone bearing Nabatean in criptions, and according to the Arabs there was also formerly the effigy of a human head or figure.— {Doughty ; Baedeker.)

BALADRUZ— A large village in 'Iraq, on the road from Baghdad to Mandali, situated from the former 46 miles by the road via Abu Aruj and 52| miles by that via Buhriz. Baladruz is thickly wooded, the houses being scattered about amongst the date gardens and fruit orchards. All these gardens and orchards are enclosed by walls about a foot and a half thick and 10 feet high. Each enclosure has one or two narrow doors. The lanes between these enclosures, which are mostly rectangular, are very dirty. The baz ar consists of one street only and is insignificant. The main canal, which comes from the north and is known as the Brladruz canal, is about 8 feet deep and 20 feet wide and when full is of course a complete obstacle to all progress except at the few places where it is bridged. There are only three such plac es in the neighbourhood of Baladruz and one bridge, about 4 miles north of the village consists merely of two date palm trunks thrown across with some earth on them. The brick bridge, which belongs to a farmstead, is 10 feet wide and strong enough for field artillery or ordinary carts. It leads into the farmyard from which there is a road with an exit right and left on the opposite side of the bridge. The farm houses and buildings are of brick and are disposed in four courtyards which lead by narrow passages into one another. The wooden bridge over the canal in the centre of the village is a fra'l structure of wood, fit for loaded mules and perhaps camels, Jbut hardly for anything heavier. It is about four feet wide and is supported in the centre by a brick column. There is not a single tree or bush between Baghdad and Mandali except at Baladruz and the country with the exception of a few mounds is as flat as a table.BAL-BAL 377 BALT— A small tribe mentioned by Palgrave as inhabiting the eastern coast of Arabia between Qatar and Basrah.

There is one well-built brick house upon the river owned by Haji Mahmud Pasha and two others have been built lately by Haji Ibrahim Abdul Wahid and Ahmad Chalabi Abdul Wahid. Resources are estimated at 15,000 palms, 200 cattle, 100 sheep and goats and 4 horses. Balja- nlyah was frequently called Balyaniyah by the Turks whose main camp and head quarters were here from outbreak of war till the Turkish defeat at Kut-i-Zain on the 17th November 1914. BALJANUJAH— Ste 'Arab (Shatt-al-), BALLAL (Q asr).— See Batin. BALQAHAIS (Maghail)— See Khatam. BAUDCHI (Tribes)—• Throughout this Gazetteer the name Baluchi, sanctioned by English usage, is used to designate the race or tribes which form the subject of this article'; but the correct form of the word in Baluchistan is Baloch both for the singular and for the plural, and there* the term Bal5chi refers only to the language spoken by the Baloch. In Arabic the name is Balush in the plural and Balushi in the singular. In Baluchistan the name Baloch is strictly employed to designate certain respect able middle-class tribes of the country only ; but in the Gulfs of Persia and 'Oman, and consequently throughout this Gazetteer (except in places in the articles relating to Persian Makran) it is used in a wider sense to include immigrants from Baluchistan generally and persons whose monther tongue is the Baluchi language. The principal tribes of Baluchis proper represented in the area covered by this Gazetteer are the Buzdars, Hots/Kalmatis, Lattis, Mullais, Rals, Rinds, Sangurs and Shaizadahs, who are scarcely if ever mentioned by their tribal names outside the limits of Persian Makran, also the Jadgals, who in Baluchistan are reckoned Baluchis, but elsewhere, and especially in the 'Oman Sultanate, are generally distinguished Under their proper name from other Baluchis. In the political divisions of the Gulfs of Persia and 'Oman Baluchis are found chiefly in the Sultanate of 'Oman, where their number is roughly estimated at 20,000, or, includ ing Jadgals, at 30,000 souls. In Trucial 'Oman they appear to number about 1,400, fmd in Turkish 'Iraq about 3,000 persons ; in the intermediate regions of Qatar, Bah , rain , , Hasa and Kuwait they are a negligable element; and in Najd they are apparently not found. A few occur in Southern 'Arabistan, chiefly as marcenaries and dependents of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. On the Persian Coast they are few until the district of ShamTl is reached, in which and in the Minab District they form an appreciable part of the population. The district of Biyaban is, like the whole of Persian Makran, almost altogether a country of Baluchis in the wider sense of the term as explained above. The Baluchis even abroad are seldom Shi'ahs, and they settle more readily among Arab than among Persian communities. Some remarks on those in the'OmSn Sulta nate will be found in the article on that country, and the article on Turkish 'Iraq explains the distribution of the Baluchis domiciled there.

Baqa'a is picturesque ly situated in a large basin of whitish sandstone, which receives the drainage of a plain between it and Jabal Jildiyah and also, it is believed, forms the conclusion of Wadi Da'aijan on which stands Hail. The village consists of two main parts, Uwaimi at the north and Shahbi at the south side of the basin, and the plain between them is covered with a thick layer of very bitter salt. These quarters consist each of a stone-walled enclosure containing a number of miserable hovels, the inhabitants being of the Sa'adah section of the 'Ataibah tribe. A little to the east is a small intermediate hamlet called Sharqi or Maraiqib ; it is inhabited by Shammar of the Ja'afar section and is believed to* be very ancient. The total population of Baqa'a is about 400 souls. Close by is an isolated path of cultivation, without palms, called Qasaifah and another called Qawaian. The date-groves are 5 miles in circuit and their produce excellent; corn and* barley also are sown every year. Water, bad and brackish, is at 40 feet below the surfaces- Only one well, in XJwaimi, yields passable water; even that is bluish and milky in appear-- ance. BAQAILAH— See Biyadh. BAQAIQ— See Biyadh.

BA'QUBAH— A town in 'Iraq ; it lies north-sorth-east of Baghdad and 31 miles from that city along the road to Khanaqm. The town is built on both banks of the ,Diyalah river and is surrounded by date plantations and other cultivation. There is a small bazaar and fuel^ fodder, and local supplies are fairly abundant. At Ba'qubah the Diyalah is crossed by a swinging bridge consisting of 11 boats, with two spare ones for increasing the span when the river rises. It is a rickety structure, serviceable for pack transport but unfit for any wheeled vehicles except very light ones. The roadway is 12 feet wide. The approaches to the bridge are soft and likely to be slippery after rain. In the autumn of 1915 this bridge was removed. The river is about 60 yards broad with prependicular banks, the right being 15 feet and the left 30 feet above the level of the water. There are telegraph and post offices in the town. The drinking water is obtained from the Diyalah river. There are no camels, but about 20 transport animals of sorts could be collected daily.

BARAIMI (O asis)—* In English formerly spelt ' Brymee, ' a remarkable oasis in the district of Jau, in a tract situated between the 'Oman Sultanate and Trucial 'Oman which may be described as Independent 'Oman ; it was formerly known also as Tuwamiyah, but this name fallen into disuse. Position and extent.— exact situation by latitude and longitude of Jimi, one of the most central villages in the oasis, is given in the table of villages below; it shows the oasis to lie a little south of a straight line drawn between the towns of Sohar and Abu Dhabi, about 65 miles west by south of the former, and 85 miles east by south of the latter. The plain of Baraimi is bordered on the north by the wilderness of Ramlat Kahal; on the east by well wooded plains and small ridges of hills belonging to the district of Jau ; on the south by Jabal Hafit; and on the west by the first dunes of an ocean of sand that stretches without interruption to the coast of Abu Dhabi. The oasis is nearly circular and its diameter is about six miles. Inhabitants and villages. —The population of Baraimi amounts to about 5,500 souls, of whom the greater number are Dhawahir, some are Na'im and a few are Bani Yas. The general condition of the people is poor, probably in consequence of tribal warfare and chronic insecurity rather than of the natural conditions of their existence, and the prosperity which seems to distinguish the place is said to be more apparent than real. The food of the inhabitants is mainly dates and coarse bread or rice, but they vary their diet with salt fish and goats' or camels' flesh. Milk is abundant, and a hard cream cheese is made, the juice of the euphorbia being sometimes used instead of rennet. The women wear an unbecoming black veil and high-heeled shoes: their work is to spin; to weave, to make felt, and to tend the goats and kine •The map for the Baraimi Oaaiais ItovU taUn by Major p. Z.

R emarks. ^Ain Dhawahir ., About 3 miles south of Baraimi Village. A village of 280 hou* ses of Dhawahir of the Jawabir sec tion. Sometimes merely called 'Ain. The lands are watered by 2 Falajs, one of which come sfrom the east and the other (called Dawu- di) from Jabal Hafit. Date palms are esti mated at 20,000, and livestock are said to be 40 horses, 150 camels, 100 donkeys, 100 cattle and 1,000 sheep and goats. Baraimi Village .. 1J miles east-south- east of Jimi, of which the position has been astrono mically determined. See article Baraimi Village. Ulli • • • • 2 miles north-north east of Baraimi Village A village of 80 houses of Dhawahir of the Daramikah section. Irrigation is by a Falaj coming from the hills to the north east. Resources are 2,000 date palms, 40 camels, 20 donkeys, 20 cattle and 60 sheep and goats ; there are no horses. Oahali .. 4 miles south-west of Baraimi Village, A date plantation with a few huts of care-takers. The place belonged originally to the Dhawahir, but it is now owned by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi who reclaimed it about ten years ago. Jimi • • Situated, according to careful observa tions by circum-me- ridional altitudes of the sun, in latitude 24° 16' ICT north and longitude 55° 42' SCT east, Madras observatory being 80° 14' 5V east of Greenwich. It is nearly in the cen tre of the oasis. A village of 200 hous es of Dhawahir of the Baiii Sa'ad sec tion. The water-supply ia from the east. Date trees are estimated at 6,000 and live stock at 6 horses, 60 camels, 40 donkeys, 40 cattle and 100 sheep and goats. WBAEAIMI 383 Name. Position. Nature. Remarks. Ma'ataradh 3 miles south*west of Baraimi Village. A village of 200 houses of Dhawahir of the Daramikah section. Water is from Jabal Hafit by Falaj. There are said to be here 4,000 date palms, 40 camels, 20 donkeys, 20 cattle and 70 sheep and goats, but no horses. Mas'udi * 2 J miles north-north- west of Baraimi Village. An encampment of Bani Yas, lately started by Khalifah, the eldest son of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The lands are water ed by a Falaj which first passes Muraijib. As yet there are no resources except a few recently planted date trees. Muraijib 2h miles west-north west of Baraimi Village. An old abandoned fort, adjoining the Falaj which goes to Mas'udi. The fort was built and used by the grandfather of the present Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. Qatarah 1J miles north-west by north of Barai mi Village. A village of 120 hou ses of Dhawahir of the Daramikah sec tion. The lands are irrigat ed by a Falaj com ing from the hills on the north-east. Re sources are estimat ed at 5,000 date palms, 60 camels, 30 donkeys, 40 cattle and 100 sheep and goats ; there are no horses. Su'arah 1 mile east by south of Baraimi Village. A village of 100 hou ses of Na'im of the Qara'tisah section. The Falaj by which the date groves are irrigated comes from the north-east. There are said to be 10,000 date trees here; also 100 camels, 50 donkeys, 50 cattle and 500 sheep and goats. The villages are unwaUed and consist of houses, built of mud and date branches which are scattered and concealed among the plantations. Besides those occupied there are many empty and dilapidated habitations. AgrkuUure.—J\ie general aspect of the oasis is verdant and fruitful. The soil though tiim is fertile, and streams of running water abound on every side; these are brought by Fala] from the hills, sometimes several miles distant, and supply the defi ciency of the slight rainfall Each village has its separate belt of date groves ; within e village the sub-division of arable land among owners is minute, and individual holdings are on the average extremely small38 i BARAWI Attention has been devoted with success to the culture of dates and other fruits; of cereals and vegetables the quantity and quality are at best moderate. Some of the best varieties of date are grown, including the Fard, Khalas and Mibsali sorts ; but they are not held in equal estimation with the produce of Wadi Samail and Badly ah in the 'Oman Sultanate. The palms of the oasis number about 60,000. Fruits other than dates are lemons, sour and sweet limes, pomegranates, water melons, musk melons, bananas, mangoes, grapes, figs and olives: the papai also exists. Cereals are wheat and barley in spring, and jowari and millet in autnmn; vegetables include sweet , potatoes, radishes, brinjals, beans, onions and garlic. Pulse, cotton—both of the white and the red flowered varities—and lucerne yielding 8 to 9 crops a year are among the other products. Leguminous plants are not here sown among cereals, but follow them in rotation on the same ground; stubble, too, is ploughed in and never burnt. It is said that coffee was once cultivated on the slopes of Jabal Hafit, but the planta tions, if any ever existed, have now disappeared. Livestock. —Horses are only seen in the possession of Shaikhs, and cattle too are somewhat scarce ; but camels are cheap and abundant, and donkeys are largely in use both as riding animals and as beasts of burden. The villages of the oasis are reckoned to possess in the aggregate about 50 horses, 550 camels, 300 donkeys, 300 cattle and 2,500 sheep and goats. Besides these a number of horses, said to be as many as 100, are ordinarily kept by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in the Oasis. Trade, —There are few or no professional traders, but a primitive local market is held each afternoon in one of the quarters of Baraimi Village; here commodities mostly change hands by barter. The foreign trade of Baraimi passes chiefly through the port of Sharjah, which is distant nearly 80 miles north-north-westwards, but also to some extent through the other coast towns of Dhabi, Dibai and Sohar.' 1 ^ Political position. —Baraimi is independent, but the influence of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in the district is strong and increasing. The ruins of the fort at Muraijib bear witness to the hereditary connection of his family with Baraimi, and he has recently acquired ( and is now engaged in developing) an estate at Jahali, while Mas'udi is being formed into a village by his eldest son. Moreover a regular tribute, of which the form and amount are mentioned in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality, is paid him by the Dhawahir who are numerically a majority in the oasis. At the present time the Shaikh could probably seize Baraimi if he wished to do so but his policy appears to be one of pacific penetration. The Na'im are the original owners of the oasis, and possession of the fort in Baraimi Village still gives them prestige and a local superiority over the Dhawahir. A few Manaslr of the Abu Khail subsec tion frequent the Baraimi Oasis or its neighbourhood in summer. BARAIMI VILLAGE*— The original and most central village of the Baraimi Oasis. It consists of 9 quar ters stretching northwards from a fort which may be regarded as one of them. The quarters are given below in alphabetical order; they are mostly inhabited by Na'im of the Qaratisah and other sections, and the population may be estimated at 500 souls altogether.

Several hundred people collect here in the afternoon and the sight is an interesting one. A fort. Described below: it»- possession is the source of the strength of the Na'im in Baraimi, There is also a quarter called Hamasah on the west of the Qasr. Except the fort none of these quarters are walled; some of the houses are of mud :^Tir ^mL d t^ ches - There ls 110 bazaar except that mentioned - sheejTa'nd'goaS ^ 100 ^ S0 50 ^ 500 The Baranni fort consists of a square with sides about 150 feet in length : the whole construction is of sun-dried brick. At each corner stands a tower about 40 feet hieh - oL * ^ courtains connecting the towers are less than 20 feet in height A drtch 25 feet broad surrounds the place; both the scarp and counter-scarp are steep and faced with brick. Two wells m the ulterior yield water, apparently of good quality and sufficient for a large garrison. The situation of the fort, standing in a plain generally good ; but on the north and west it is too nearly adjoined by houseTand cultivation, and on the opposite side the ruins of another fort were (in 1875) capable of affording shelter to an attacking force. A wooden gate in the south face was (in l8/o) the_ weakest feature of the work. The Baraimi fort is not equal to the best of those in the Sultanate of Oman, but it is the key of the 'Oman Sultanate on the- west and must necessarily, as has been observed, be reduced or masked bv an invader of the Sultanate approaching from that direction. y BARAIQA— An anchorage in the Hejaz Tihamah, 38 nautical miles south -eastward of Yanbo' It is an excellent harbour for 5 or 6 small craft, but has a narrow gut, only 50 yards wide for an entrance The upper part of the inlet is choked by an extensive flat, drv at low water, but there is a narrow boat channel on the northern side, which leads to a low strip of land on which are the ruins of a fortified town.

BARHUT (Bin)— A well and volcano in Hadhramawt. Hunter places it on his map some 15 miles south-west of Qabr Hud. Von Wrede, however, says, from native information obtained at Qabr Hud, that it is 4 hours' journey in a northerly direction from that place. He also states that the volcano is an enormous fissure 500 paces long, and half as broad, and that a constant rumbling of water can be heard. Bent says the Bedouins obtain sulphur from it for making gun-powder.— [Hunter ; Von Wrede ,* the Bents,) BlRID (Btj)— See Dhafrah. BARIDI— A cape 35 miles north-west of Yanbo'. It is a moderately high promontory forming a curve to the westward about 7 miles in breadth. The shore is bounded by steep coral cliffs having no bottom at 30 fathoms.

It consists of wells and woods situated about 4 miles slightly south of west from Sha'aibah, and about 2 miles east by south from Chawaibdah. It was here that the British defeated the Turks on April 14th, 1915.—• {Murphy.) BARKAH— A considerable town on the coast of the Batinah district of the 'Oman Sultanate : it lies about 43 miles west by north of Masqat Town and is on the east side of Wadi Ma'awal at its mouth. The place extends along the shore for about 3 miles and consists mostly of huts scattered among the date-plantations. There is no harbour, only an open road-stead. In the centre of the place rises a lofty fortress, with flanking towers at the angles. The houses surrounding the fort on east, south and west number about 1,200, but some of them are empty and the population of the town may be estimated at about 5,000 souls. The inhabitants of the eastern quarters are chiefly Dawakah, Muwalik and Mashafirah, with some A1 Hamad and Siyabiyin; in the neighbourhood of the fort the population is mixed; the western quarters are tenanted by Hirth, Ghawarib, Ma'awal, Muwalik, A1 Badar, Hikman and Bani Bu Hasan. There are also some Daru'. These Arab tribes (except the Muwalik, most of whom are found here) number on the average only 20 households each and their number is exceeded by that of the Baliichis and Jadgals who form the remainder of the population. A few Khojahs also are found, and there are 11 Hindus, the latter representing 6 commercial concerns and enjoying British protection. Many of the Arabs are Bedouins—still owning cattle, sheep and camels.—who have settled down and acquired date-plantations ; and some should be classed as a rural rather than as an urban popula tion, occupying as they do a great part of the country between the town and the promon tory opposite the Suwadi islands. Temporary Bedouin visitors are also numerous. In the date-season the population of Barkah is swelled by immigrants from Masqat Town and elsewhere who come to work as harvesters. Barkah is celebrated chiefly for its dates. The groves extend continuously from Wadi Manumah, 6 miles east of the town, to Wadi- al-Qasim, some 10 miles to westward of it, and the trees number 40,000 or more. There is also some ordinary cultivation ; and in the month of August large quantities of a shell fish called Dok, resembling a cockle, are collected and dried in the sun for export to the interior. Live-stock are 6 horses, 700 camels, 200 donkeys, 500 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats. The bazaar contains over 100 shops dealing in ordinary wares. Barkah possesses 20 large Badans and is the port of the villages in Wadis Lajal and Ma'awal and partially of those in Wadis Tau and Bani Kharas, as also of the town of Nakhl. The place is governed by a Wali with a salary of $1,800 a year on behalf of the Sultan of 'Oman, who also maintains in the fort a garrison of 20 men commanded by an Aqid. The customs of the port produce about $3,000 a year and $1,800 is realised at Zakat; the former amount is locally expended, and of the latter only $ 1,200 reaches the Sultan's treasury. The customs here have been under direct management instead of being farmed, since 1901-02.

BA'RtR (U mm-al)— A village, formerly chef-lieu of the Qadha of ShSmiyah in Turkish 'Iraq ; it is situated 17 or 18 miles east by south of the town of Najaf in the marshes which compose the Sha- miyah district. The population of Umm-al-Ba'rur is now very small, and the majority of the inhabitants, though the place was till lately the administrative headquarters of a Qadha, merely inhabit reed huts. Umm-al-Ba'rur is regarded as unhealthy and was abandoned by the administration for this reason. Its place has been taken by Hami- dlyah, a town which has sprung up on the left bank of the Abu Kufuf canal about 2 miles above Umm-al-Ba'rur. Hamidlyah is said to contain 800 houses, 150 shops, 3 mosques, 3 khans and 10 granaries, also a Government Sarai and barracks.

BASHUBAR (K hor-al)— One of the numerous channels in the Persian Gulf, leading between the islets and reefs off the coast of Trucial 'Oman. It is situated between the islet of Halat al-MubarrazBAR-BAS 39 1 and Bazani reef, which latter is near the mouth of Khor-al-Bazam [q. v.). It has 7 or 8 fathoms of water and is about \\ miles wide ; through it the tidal stream runs with great strength at springs.— {Persian Gulf Pilot, 1909.) BASITAH (A l)— A wide, basaltic plain in north-western Arabia, stretching from the Ardh-as-Sawwan to the borders of the Nafiid desert, and from the Jabal Tubayk to the Wadi Sirhan. Its surface is generally smooth and black, and absolutely bare. From the numerous little circular threshing-floors with which the plain is dotted, and where the Bedouins prepare the seed called semh, it would seem that now and then some vegetation is to be found, here. The semh plant, according to the Arabs, cannot be reproduced from seed, neither have they ever succeeded in cultivating it. For this reason the Sharrarat call it ' the gift of the rain.' , The grain is dried in the sun and ground into flour ; this they make into bread, or mix with their dates, or eat as porridge. The average height of the plain is between 3,000 and 2,500 feet. It contains few well-marked features, the chief being the hills of Ijala and Wa'la, and theWadi Draif.—(Cambers, 1909.) BASMAN (Tribe)— See Dawasir (Tribe). BASR— See Qasim. BASRAH QADHA— Position and boundaries.—The Qadha of Basrah is situated on both sides of the Shatt-al- , 'Arab and extends from a few miles above Basrah Town down to Zain on the right and down to the Persian frontier upon the left bank. It is bounded by the Qadha of Qurnah on the north, by Persian territory upon the east, by the Qadha of Fao upon the south and by deserts upon the west. Tocography and inhabitants. —The most populous and important place in the Qadha is the town of Basrah, to which a separate article is devoted; but Hamdan Abu Khaslb and Zubair also are towns of considerable size and consequence and there are numerous large villages such as Khorah, Muhaijaran, Sabiliyat and Abu Mughairah upon the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab and Da'aiji upon the left bank. The region is probably the most densely inhabited in 'Iraq and even in the whole Persian Gulf. The main feature of the district and that to which it owes its entire character is the Shatt-al-'Arab, in the article upon which and its islands will be found detailed topo graphical information about the whole Qadha. The rural tribes in the settlments irri gated by the river are chiefly 'Atub, 'Idan and Muhaisin. PopvMion.'—Th.Q fixed population of the Qadha appears to be as follows, according to the Nahiyahs of which the positions are explained in the paragraph on administration below:— Nahiyah of 'Arab (Shatt-al-) .. „ Basrah {i.e., Basrah Town) .. „ Harthah .. „ Khasib (Abul) „ Zubair {i.e., Zubair Town) 150,000 souls. About half the population of Basrah Town together with the entire population of Zubair lown are Sunni Muhammadans, and nearly the whole remainder of the people are feniahs' ^ere are about 2,500 Christians of various sects and about 2 000 Jews both of which communities are located chiefly in Basrah Town. ' ' Resources.~--ThQ Zubair Nahiyahis situated in the desert, but the other Miivahs to gether consititute one of the richest date-producing tracts in the world. Some cereals are grown in the more open lands, and lucerne and vegetables are cultivated among the date trees. Livestock also are abundant and include buffaloes. 58,000 12,500 56,500392 BASEAH BASRAH TOWN— The second largest town in 'Iraq, situated on the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab; 69J miles by river from the Persian Gulf. The population of the town and suburbs is estimated at 80,000 and is rapidly increasing. There are important wireless installa- tions, and telegraph communication with Fao (the cable station), Muhammarah, Nasiriyah and Baghdad. General Description, —The main part of the town (Basra, proper) lies about 2 miles back from the river, from which the tops of its minarets are visible. Along the river front are a number of large private houses, some of which belong to Europeans, the offices, sheds, and wharves of various firms, the late British and German consulates, and the Turkish custom-house. The German consulate lay about | mile, and the British consulate about 1 mile, above Khorah creek. The premises of Messrs. Lynch lie immediately below the former British consulate. Two large creeks, the Nahr Ashar and the Nahr Khandaq, leave the right bank of the river 400 and 1,100 yards respectively above the British consulate. They run in a general south-south-west direction for about 3 miles. Their width is about 50 yards at the entrance, and gradually diminishes. The mouth of the Nahr Ashar, which leads to the main town, is marked by the large Turkish custom-house which is situated on its north side, while to south of it is a workshop formerly belonging to the Dd 'irat as-Sanlyah in which there were a few machine tools, and where small castings could be made and ordinary engineering repairs executed. Immediately opposite the Turkish custom-house on the left bank of the Shatt-al- 'Arab is the former Turkish Marine Hospital. On the spit between the Ashar and Khandaq creeks, called Dob, a little way back from the Shatt-el- 'Arab, is the large suburb of Maqam or Ashar, the former name being that by which it is generally known, while the latter is that given to it by the Turks. Ashar suburb is approached by the creek of the same name on the north bank of which it lies. It contains shops, cafes, and a considerable population. A post and telegraph office was situated here before the war. On the south-east side of this suburb the Ashar creek is crossed by a wooden bridge passable for vehicles: on th3 north-west side towards the Khandaq creek lie the former Turkish barracks. The Khandaq creek in the neighbourhood of its mouth is the centre of the grain trade. It is lined with stores and depots, send m&amp;ny maTiailahs and other sailing craft lie moored at its entrance. At} mile up the creek on its north bank is a dry dock which belonged to the Ddimt-as-Sanlyah. Here new river steamers were put together in 1904. Passenger hellams ply on the Ashar creek from the Shatt-el- 'Arab to the main town, and there is also a road for vehicles (the Strand) along its south bank. A long this road are numerous large houses belonging to Europeans or natives. Here stood in 190S the American Consular Agency, the Russian consulate and the office of the Russian Steam Navigation Company. In 1914 the residence of the Turkishalso lay hore. On the north side of the creek, a short distance beyond Ashar is the American Mission Hospital. Between this point and the main town the date groves line the northern bank. On the outskirts of Basrah proper, and close to the Ashar creek is the Serai or principal group of Government buildings. The main town, which stretches up the Ashar creek for about 1 mile to the bridge called the Jisr-al-Ghurban, was before the war unlighted, unpaved, and notoriously insanitary. It contains seven mosques and several shrines and Imdmzddeks. The main bazaar runs near the Ashar creek southwards through the busiest part of the town to a suburb called Mishraq: it is about } mile long, and is built of brick and roofed all the way. At the north end are a few shops which deal in European commodities. In Mishraq is the mosque of Shaikh 'Ablullah Bash A'yan, from the minaret a good view can be obtained of the town and surrounding palm groves. The Persian consulate and a telegraph office are situated in the main town. Just below the Jisr-al-Ghurban mentioned above are some of the best native resi dential houses occupied by officials and rich merchants. The walls and gates of the town proper which till recently existed in a dilapidated state, have now practically disappeared. The better houses in the residential quarters are mostly built of soft yellow burnt brick, but timber is often used for the upper stories. Climate and Hygiene. In December and January the weather at Basra is cold, some times with frost at night. The months of July, August, and September are intenselyBASRAH hot, and the population lives largely 'in 'underground rooms. The rest of the year resembles the spring and summer of Southern Europe. The greatest heat experienced in summer is ordinar ly about 112° F., and in winter the thermometer falls to 35° or lower. The hottest weather is generally in July, the coldest in January. The climate is injurious in summer and malarious all the year round. An outbreak of bubonic plague occurred in 1910, and epidemics of cholera occurred in 1910 and 1911. Before the present war the native population used the Ashar creek for drinking water and also as a sewer. Supplies and Commerce. —Wheat, barley, and rice are locally available in normal times* The amounts vary in different years. Dates are abundant, especially in Sep tember. Vegetables poor in quality can be procured at Zubair. Fruit is plentiful. Beef is scanty and poor in quality, but sheep are numerous. The best water is from the open stream of the Shatt el-'Arab, but this is not wholesome owing to drainage from swampy areas. The water from the Ashar canal is drunk by the poorer classes, but as they are said to use the canal as ' wash-tub, bath, dustbin, and cesspool' it had better be avoided. Norton tube wells would be useful at any camps away from the river, and their use was recommended after the 1857 expedition to Mohammareh. Watering animals in the river is difficult as the banks are shelving and muddy. Pumps with a length of pipe to run the water into trough should be used. Date trees are difficult to fell and too valuable for fuel. A small prickly shrub called shok is grown outside the town ; coal is stored for river steamers, average stock with Grey, Mackenzie &amp; Co., about 800 tons. For transport at Basra in normal times 200 camels could be obtained (a large number could also probably be secured from Zubair), 200 donkeys, and 1,000 horses, including 200 pack horses* Basra besides having a local trade in dates and grain, is the port of Baghdad, which is the chief distributing centre in Mesopotamia, Practically all goods consigned' to tho interior are included in the shipping returns of Basra, whose imports and exports con stitute the foreign trade of Iraq and to some extent of Western Persia also. Under the Caliphates Basra was a clearing house where traders from Africa, India, and the Far East met to transact business with the Moslem world and with Europe. The importance of Basra began to decline with the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, and became still less when the Suez Canal was opened. At the present time it shows signs of re covery, although it was adversely affected by the political and economic crisis through which Turkey passed in 1913, aggravated by severe agricultural depression conse quent on the poor grain crops of that year. In 1911 the total value of imports into the port of Basrah was £2,855,677 ; that of exports £2,525,847, In 1912, imports were valued at £2,637,809, and exports at £3,246,560. In 1913 the value of imports was £3,899,273, that of exports £1,939,259. In these figures is included the value of goods imported to or exported from Baghdad by way of Basrah. It will be seen that in 1911 there was an excess of imports over exports ot about £330,000 ; in 1912, an excess of exports over imports of about £608,000 ; and in 1913 owing to the failure of the cereal crops and to the large imports in connexion with the Baghdad Railway, an excess of imports over exports of about £1,960,000. The principal imports were cotton goods, woollen cloths, loaf and crystal sugar, date-boxwood and planks, yarn and twist, machinery, coffee and tea, copper, iron and steel (for the Baghdad Railway), petroleum, gunnies. In 1913, when the'rice crop failed much rice was imported from India. The principal exports were dates, cereals (barley, wheat, and rice : very variable) seeds, wool, ghi, liquorice, opium (from Persia), gallnuts (from Kurdistan), hides and skins, carpets, horses (from Arabia). Dates are the most valuable export, and are sent chiefly to England and America. The export of liquorice is also important. The root, which grows especially on the Tigris banks, is collected in the winter months', when it contains most juice, and, after being weighed and cured at the receiving stations it is forwarded to Basra where it is baled by hydraulic power. The export of'cereals in the three years 1911—13 varied from 231,171 tons in a good year (1912) to 44,283 tons in 1913 when the harvest was bad. The cereal exported in the largest quantities is barley. C52(w)GSB 3J;m BASRAH The date trade supplies the only local export of any importance, most of the business done being in the way of agency or forwarding. The Euphrates valley as far as Hilla probably draws directly on Basrah for its imported commodities, but this is perhaps the limit of the importance of Basrah as a pivot of internal trade. The key to Baghdad trade is to be found in the ocean trade prevailing at Basrah and the river freights between Basra and Baghdad. British interests in Basrah date from the establishm9nt of the English Factory by the East India Company more than 150 years ago. In 1913 the number of steam vessels of ali nationalities that entered and cleared the port of Basra was 195 with a net tonnage of 327,913, and of these 163 were British^ having a net tonnage of 254,714. The number of sailing vessels was 250 (19,026 tons) of which 137 were British (11,595 tons») Despite its commercial importance the Turkish Government had not constructed wharves or pontoons at Basra, leaving ships to load and unload by means of lighters. The following lines of ocean steamers called regularly at Basra t—- The British India Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. The Ellerman and Bucknall Steamship Co., Ltd k The Strick Liner Messrs. Marcus Samuel and Co. Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. (chartered steamers). The Arab Steamers, Ltd. The Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. Haji Sultan 'Ali Shustari Line. The Hamburg America Line. The Russian Steamship Navigation Co. Numerous steamers were chartered annually for the export of dates at harvests. During the years preceding the present war the following lines of river steamers navi gated the Shatt-al-Arab and Tigris up to Baghdad The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch Bros.). The Idarah Nahriyah, a Turkish company. These companies were amalgamated in 1914 under the name ' Mackay, Lynch &amp; Co. v Trade on the Tigris was largely carried on in sailing vessels {maheilehs). The European firms with offices at Basra are :— Messrs. Lynch Bros. (Merchants : carrying trade on the Tigris and Karun). Messrs. Grey, Mackenzie &amp; Co. (Merchants : importers and exporters : agents for the British India Steam Navigation Co., and Ellerman &amp; Bucknall Steamship Lines). Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp;Co. (Merchants: importers and exporters, shipowners, agents for the Anglo Persian Oil Company). Messrs. MacAndrew, Forbes &amp; Co. (American firm: exporters of liquorice). Basra Trading Company (British firm : exporters of dates and grain). Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. (German firm : agents for Hamburg America Line). Russian Steamship and Trading Company, of edessa, had an agency here. Messrs. Asfar &amp; Co. are an important native Christian firm. There is a branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Basra. ' Inhabitants. —The popultion is mainly composed of sedentary Arabs. There'are also several thousand Persians, a considerable Jewish settlement, and a small colony of resident Indians. Negroes of servile origin are fairly numerous. In 1913 there was a floating population of the labouring class which numbered some 10,000 persons, variously engaged in the grain trade of the port. The Sunni and Shiah sects are said to be about equally balanced in numbers. The few Indian Mohammadans are mostly Sunnis. Some of the wealthiest merchants are Jews. Administration and Aothorities. —Basra town was the head-quarters of the Turkish Wildyat of the same name, and the seat of a Wali. It also formed a Ndhiyah in the Basra Qadha, The latter area was under the direct charge of the Vali. The city was nomi nally under a powerless and inefficient municipal council. The Ddirat-as-Sanlyak had offices here, including a Mamun and subordinate staff, who control the Shatt-el- 'Arab properties. There was a local Saniyeh committee. The principal offices of the navigation branch of this department were established here under a Director subordinate to the central committee in Baghdad. There was a Mudir of customs under theBASRAH 395 Director-General of customs at Baghdad. Shipping and rivet conservancy were in the hands of a harbour-master. The Turkish garrison consisted normally of two battalions of infantry, with some artillery and a detachment of engineers. A naval commodore was stationed here in. command of two gunboats. One of the most important personages in Basrah before the war was the unscrupulous Saiyid Talib Bey (Naqibzadeh), who had great mfluence among the Arabs of the town^ He is said to have terrorized Basra through a band of armed men. In 1914 there were at Ba§ra British, French, Russian, American^ Dutch, Persian, and German consuls. History. —Old Basra, the ruins of which lie about 8 mile south-west by west of the modern town, and extend for about 3 miles in the same direction up to the walls of Zobeir, was founded by the Caliph Omar in A. D. 638. In the Middle Ages Old' Basra was famous as a seat of learning, and as the port for the sea-borne commerce between the flourishing Mesopotamia of the Caliphate and the countries of the further East. (The Arabian Nights make Sinbad the Sailor start from Basra on his voyages.) The city was connected with the Shatt el-'Arab by the much more ancient town of Ubullah, which is believed to have stood on the site of the present Maqam. Basra suffered from the rapid decline of Mesopotamian prosperity due to the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The old city was eventually abandoned, and New Basra took its place. In the seventeenth century Basra was occasionally visited by English merchants engaged in the Indian trade. In 1668 Basra (on its present site) was conquered by the Turks, and, except for short intervals in the eighteenth century when it was held first by Persians and then by Muntefiq Arabs, it remained in their hands till 1914. Under the Muntefiq Arabs the population of Basra had sunk to a few thousands. The town apparently owed its revival mainly to the development of trade with British India in the nineteenth century : a development made possible by the policing of the Persian Gulf by the British Govern ment, and by its influence in Iraq. In recent years the advantages and disadvantages of Basra as a possible terminus for the Baghdad Railway have been under consideration. It was at first believed that the commercial value of its position would be largely dis counted by the cost of maintaining a depth of water on the Shatt-el- 'Arab bar sufficient to alJow large ocean-going steamers to enter the river at any time. It has lately been reported, however, that at a moderate outlay the bar could be dredged so as to allow the passage of vessels drawing 25-26 feet. Dob and Maqdm. —The spit between the 'Ashar and Khandaq creeks is called Dab ; it is about half a mile broad and is overgrown with dates except so much of it as is within a mile of the Shatt-al-'Arab. In this lower and open extremity there stands, upon the 'Ashar creek at J to J a mile from its entrance, an important quarter of the town which was formerly known as Maqam 'Ali or Maqam, but is now styled 'Ashar. Maqam contains houses, shops, cafes and a considerable population, and it has a post office and telegraph office, here too were a flour mill and an ice factory belonging to a Jew, but they have been transferred to 'Ajairawiyah island. Behind Maqam, more in the direction of the Khandaq creek, are the barracks formerly occupied by the Turkish military garrison. The 'Ashdr creek. —The 'Ashar creek has been partially described above. It remains to mention that superior houses are now springing up along its south-eastern bank ; some of these are occupied by Europeans and one is the private residence of the present Wali of Basrah. Opposite the middle of Maqam the 1 Ashar creek is spanned by whitelly's bridge which can be crossed by horses and vehicles and of which part can be removed to allow boats with masts, etc., to pass. The Khandaq creek. —The Khandaq creek, of which the general character has already been outlined, is the seat of the grain trade ; its banks are lined with yards and depots r and many Mahailahs and other boats constantly lie moored within its entrance. The Khandaq is bridged in two places. The hanks of the Shatt-al- Arab at Basrah. —A number of localities which may fairly be considered as included in Basrah Town are situated on the banks of the Shatt-al-'Arab, 3e2396 BASRAH partly above and partly below the British Consulate. These we enumerate, in the order in which they are passed by the river, beginning with the furthest up-stream :— Right bank. Rubat (Nahr-ar-),. Khandaq (Nahr-al-) 'Ashar (Nahr-al-).. Old British Consulate (by Arabs called Bait-al-Baly5z) or Qunsulkhanah. Left bank. A creek, the next above the Nahr-al- Khandaq, from which it is about 500 yards distant. On the north side of it are a new house belonging to Mlrza Hamzah, the Arab Secretary of the Shaikh of Muham- mareh, and a house belonging to Raphael Sayegh ; below it is a house belonging to Asfar and Co. This creek, 1,200 yarcts above the old British Consulate, has already been fully described. On the north side of the entrance are the premises of the Basrah Trading Co,, known as ' Bait Muir ' but owned by Asfar and Co. This creek opens into the river 300 yards above the old British Consulate and has been described at length above. A large handsome building with a high flagstaff upon the bank of the river : Immediately above the Consulate are the offices of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Co., and just below it and a little further inland are those of Messrs. Lynch Bros. Gardilan Tanumah Khastahkhanah 'Askari. A creek and large village about 1 mile up-stream from the British Consulate. Below Gardi lan are 3 large houses owned by Ibn-al-Faraib, Salim-al-Badr and Mu hammad - ash - Sha'aibi'; the last of these 3 pro prietors is now in exile and his house remains unfinished. Some date plantations at Gardilan are owned by nephews of the present Shaikh of Kuwait. The old Turkish Govern ment hospital exactly opposite the entrance of the 'Ashar creek; it was originally a naval hospi tal. In maps it is gene- tally shown as Gardilan, but it should rather be called Tanumah. A small village with some cultivation about oppo site to the old British Consulate. During the crisis between Turkey and Kuwait in 1901-02 about 8,000 troops were en camped here on the go links.398 BAS—BAT BASRAH—' A hamlet lying to- the north-east of, and about thirteen miles inland from, the town of Makalla which is the port of the Hadhramawt.

BATIH— A considerable tract of land in Kiiwait territory between Kuwait Bay and the Turkish butpost of Safwan: Batih begins 23 miles north of Jahrah, its extent from south to north is 22 miles, and its end 11 miles south of Safwan. On the east it is separated from Khor-as-Sabiyah by a low-lying tract called Rodhatain, and on the west it reaches to the locality known as Umm-al-Khllan. Batih consists of undulating perfectly waterless desert and lies somewhat high, its elevation above the sea varying from 130 to 210 feet. Numerous slight ridges cross it from west to east, the more northern appearing to be included under the common name of Hamar,* and the slope of the country downwards from west to east is uniform but gradual. Batih is traversed from west to east near its northern extremity by a broad, shallow depression called Bil Jirfan and towards its southern end by a series of sandy runs, through which the rainfall drains from the higher ground in the west down to Rodhatain : between these twcs on the southern side of a well-marked ridge, is a locality which appears to be generally known under the name of Batih-al- 'Aud or Great Batih. A few gazelle are to be seen in Batih, BATIH-AL- ^AUD— A locality in Batih {q. v.}. BATIN— A village iq the Abu Dhabi Principality {q. v.). BATIN— A sandbank off the island of Abu 'Ali {q. v.), BATIN— That portion of the bed of Wadi Hanifah which passes through Dara'iyah {q, v.), BATIN OR BATAIN— The final and lowest section of the great Wadi-ar-Rummah, of which the middle and upper course lies in Najd. The Batin may be considered to reach the Kuwait frontier first at Hafar; from Hafar it runs for about 61 miles north-eastwards to Riqa'i and from Riqa'i it continues in the same direction for about 95 miles further to the neigh bourhood of Jabal Sanam, to the westward of which it passes at a distance of 15 miles, thereafter vanishing altogether, t The Batin is generally a well-marked depression, varying in breadth from 8 miles (as at Hafar) to 2 miles (as at Riqa'i). The actual bottom or bed of the valley measures about 3 miles across at Hafar, but it is ordinarily much less, and for some distance above Riqa'i its width does not exceed ^ a mile; it shows no signs of water action, but it is covered with a level deposit of dark-coloured clay which may have been gradually washed down from the higher ground on either side. The level bed bears large patches of low scrub which give cover to gazelle and bustard. Between Hafar and Jabal Sanam the Batin is approximately the north-western boundary of the Shaikhdom of Kuwait, but the Shaikh asserts that his influence extends some distance beyond it. The routes from Basrah and Kuwait to Qaslm run along the Batin, the former joining it near Jabal Sanam and the latter at Riqa'i. The Hamar ridges have a slightly reddish tmge (whence their name) and are said to curve southwars between Batih and the sea ending somewhere near Mdairah. The drainage, nevertheless of the connfrvSwaS Khor-as-Sabiyah is apparently not intercepted By these ridges.

It is possible that Dhahirah is so called because it is high and prominent while Batinah has received its name because it is low-lying and not visible from a distance. Or the names may be referred to other senses of the Arabic roots, and we may connect Batinah with the ' belly ' which is in front and Dhahirah with the ' back' which is behind. * C52(w)GSB 3* r402 BlTINAH. 'Oman from the Persian Gulf. Its extreme points are Khatmat Milahah, a spur coming down close to the sea nearly 3 miles north-north-west of Murair, and Hail A1 'Umair On the south-east, which are 150 miles apart in a direct line; its boundary inland in the foot of the Western Hajar hills which run roughly parallel to the coast at a distance varying from 10 to 20 miles. The exact boundary with the Qasimi district of Shamailiyah be yond Murair is marked at the present time by a stone wall which runs seawards for a quarter of a mile from the extremity of the hills and through a gap in which the road from Murair to Ghallah passes.* Physical geography.—The whole of Batinah is a low-lying plain, sandy towards the sea, clayey in the interior, and stony as the hills are approached. There are no springs, but water is everywhere obtainable from wells which are generally 15 to 20 feet deep. The great valleys of the seaward slope of Western Hajar all traverse Batinah on their way to the coast; but their courses within the limits of Batinah are often ill-defined, and in some cases their channels are so broken up and dispersed as to render uncertain the point at which they reach the sea. A list of the principal of these valleys, in order from east to west, will be found in the article on Western Hajar: some of them bear in Batinah names different from those by which they are distinguished in the hills. The coast of Batinah is destitute of prominent capes, and the only islands that lie off it are those of the Daimaniyat and Su \ adi groups. Climate. —The Batinah coast is much cooler in summer, especially at night, than the rocky coastal tract to the east of it in which Masqat Town is situated. The months of May, June and July are healthy, but fever begins with the date harvest. There are heavy rains in the winter months. Inhabitant*. —The largest and most important tribes of Batinah are the Yal Sa'ad and the Hawasinah ; the remainder may be ascertained from the paragraph on popula tion in the article on the 'Oman Sultanate. Batinah is an exceedingly populous district in the neighbourhood of the coast; and a number of the tribes represented in the towns and villages are understood to have Bedouin sections which wander in the interior of the district with their flocks and herds. Practically the whole of the people belong to the Hinawi faction. The following is an estimate of the settled population of Batinah :■— Eastern Batinah, viz., Places on the coast (see end of this article) .. .. 51,200 Wadi Bani Ghafir— (Lower) .. .. .. •. .. ^ • 2,800 Western Batinah, viz., the sub-Wilayats of—• Liwa .. 12,500 Saham .. .. •, ^ ^ ^. .. 12,800 Shinas .. .. . ♦ . * • • ' 6,200 Sohar .. • • .■ «■ &lt;• •• 20,000 Total w 105,500 souls. The nomads of Batinah, wfcose number is quite uncertain, belong chiefly to the impor tant Hawasinah, Bani KharQs and Yal Sa'ad tribes and to the less important tribes of the Biduwat, Al Hamad, Yal Jarad, Muwalik, Nuwafil, Al Bu Qarain, Al Bu Rashaid and Shabua. Agriculture, animals andfishenes. —Batinah is celebrated principally for its dates, and the Arabs have a saying that a man can walk along the coast from one end of the district to the other without leaving the shade of the palms ; the statement is not literally true, but it conveys without much exaggepatfon an idea of the magnificent date belt which fringes the sea-shore almost continuously and has sometimes a depth of 7 miles inland. There is also much ordinary cultivation along the coast; the chief crops are wheat, +wh'f fjtvd ri barley,- c0tton,t sugar, and lucerne, and some tobacco is grown in the north-westernmost villages. Fruits include—besides dates—-mangoes, bananas, pomegranates, figs, limes, melons, quinces, olives, Loz almonds, papay, cocoanuts, and jack fruit. Coffee, indigo, sweet potatoes, millet, many leguminous plants, apricots, peaches and nuts, oaks, planes, and nabaq furnish timber for ships and house building. All crops are irrigate •See plan No. 1363 in the Foreign and Political Department Library, Simla.BATINAH 403 from wells which are copious and, as already mentioned, not deep. The interior of Batinah, with the exception of a few spots, appears to be uncultivated and barren. The domestic animals are camels, horses, cattle, goats and dogs, but horses are few ; wild animals include the gazelle and the hare. The country, though suitable enough for wheeled traffic, has no vehicles. The fisheries of the coast are productive. The commonest kind of fishing-boat is the Shashah, composed of a bundle of date stalks held together with string, which floats, by the buoyancy of its materials and not by excluding water; in these slight but un- submersible craft the people of Batinah put to sea in all weathers and perform journeys of 50 miles and more. 7Vad^.~-The only article of exportation is the date. Imports are principally rice, cotton goods, sugar and coffee, received for the most part from India through Masqat Town; and the trade, in consequence of the denseness of the local population and of the fact that the valleys of Western Hajar are supplied through the Batinah ports, is not inconsiderable. The coast of Batinah possesses no harbours, nor even any creeks that are accessible to boats except of the smallest size; it lies quite open to the Shamal and is a dead lee-shore in a Na'shi. Nevertheless some sea-going and coasting craft belong to Batinah, and the following table of its ports, in order from east to west, contains particulars regarding them :— Port.

BATINlYAH— According to Palgrave, this is the name of a number of sects, originating in 'Oman and widely diffused through Al-Hasa, whose tendencies are a bitter and resolute oppo sition to Islam especially in its Wahhabi form. It seems, however, that the Batiniyah were Ibadhis who objected, not to Islam, but to what they considered the heresy of Wahhabism. There is now no particular sect called Batiniyah, and the feeling has cer^ tamly died out in Al-Hasa if not in 'Oman also. The term Batiniyah was perhaps first applied in a general way to the people of the Batinah coast.— (Murvhy ) C52(w)GSB * y o a f410 BAT-BAT batn— See 'Anizah. .

Bau'an lies in a vailley of the same name, and on the right bank of a running brook known as Asfarah, which flows in an easterly direction from the hills round the Salami pass. This brook is spanned at Bau'an by a bridge of well-pointed masonry. The road from here to Sana'a might be traversed by a motor-car.

BAYASIRAH— Or Bayasir, singular Baisar. A community or tribe of inferior social status, found everywhere in 'Oman, but especially at Nakhl, Bahlah and Nizwa and in the coast towns of Masqat, Matrah, Saham and Sohar ; they occur also at various places in Wadi Samail, and at Misinnah and Mali in Wadi Bani Ghafir. Their origin in doubtful; some au thorities state that they are a tribe of Handhramauti origin, but it appears to be the case that most of them are merely the children of 'Omani Arabs by slave mothers. Some are Ghafiris and some Hinawis, and there is no agreement among them in religious matters. They are peaceable and industrious and some have accumulated wealth, but the Arabs do not entrust them with authority or command ; and they are accustomed to remove their sandals, after the manner of servants and inferiors, before kissing the hands of Shaikhs. Those who regard the Bayasirah as a regularly constituted tribe divide them into the following 4 sections: Aulad Barakain and Aulad 'Abdu with headquarters at Nakhl, Aulad Subah with headquarters at Nizwa, and Al Khasaib with headquarters at Masqat Town: there are also at Nakhl sections or sub-sections called Aulad Hamad and Aulad 'Ubaidan. The Bayasirah number perhaps 10,000 souls and are connected, among others, with the following tribes: with the Bani Hasan, 400 houses; with the Bani Ruwahah, 70 houses; with the Bani Battash, 30 houses; and with the Habus, 20 houses.

BEDOUIN TRIBES— This article is designed to give an account of those tribal constituents of present-day Arabian society, which are essentially nomadic—those, in short,, to which Arabs them selves concede the name Bedawi. The Bedawi type o£ society is the product of desert and steppe conditions, and connot survive long under others. A tribe, which has left such conditions to settle in an oasis or other permanently arable land, does not necessari ly cease to be a tribe, but it does cease to be a Bedawi tribe. Therefore all those tribes of which most members now inhabit continuously fertile lands^or tracts of oasis.character will be excluded from the following consideration — such, for example, as the tribes of 'Asir, Yemen and hinterland, the Aden Protectorate, Hadhramaut and the South Littoral, 'Oman, and the Trueial Coast. On the other hand, Bedawi constituents of Arabian society which have passed wholly or in part northwards out of the peninsula are included. Not having changed the essential conditions of their life, but still ranging deserts and steppes, they have remained Bedu. It would be unsatisfactory not to take account here of the tribes of the Syrian Hamad and the Mesopotamian Jezireh. They are regarded by the peninsular Bedawis as forming one great social block with themselves, and some, e.g., certain constituents of the great Anazeh group, still pass at regular seasons southward into the peninsula, while- others have their own home ranges in the peninsula itself. Moreover, many, like the Ruwalla, Dhufir, and Huweitat, move habitually from one side to the other of the border line, and some, e.g., the Mesopotamian Shammar, though they stay to the north of it are integral parts of larger tribal units still at home in the south. For convenience, we adopt a geographical division of Bedawi tribes into Northern,, Central (Western and Eastern), and Southern. At the outset, a tree of tribal descent from the Arch-Patriarch, Abraham, will show what Arabs consider to be the true Bedawi stock. To know this pedigree is of practical value to any one who has to deal with Arab nomads, owing to the value which they themselves attach to genealogy, the social distinctions which they base upon it, and the estimation in which they hold those expert in its intricacies. C52(w)GSB 3 b r2*7 BEDOUIN 419 The Nomad Tribes of Arabia. ^ The distribution of nomadic tribes over the deserts of Arabia, Mesopotamia and Syria is the result of long and slow migrations concerning which there is little accurate record. The local materials for the history of nomadic Arabia are of two kinds. The first is a small and precious body of inscriptions dating from the earliest times until the age of the Prophet, which provide a solid framework of contemporary evidence; the second is a mass of tradition derived partly from such scanty familiarity with Jewish and Christian books as was current in Arabia, and partly from the poets who flourished in the first century before Islam. The historic value of the latter source is a subject of dispute,, The poetry of the Age of Ignorance was not put down in writing until the second or third century after the Hejra, and the compilations then produced were the work of scholars living m Baghdad and other great centres of Muhammadan civilization Outside Arabia proper. Among these diligent collectors of the ancient literature of their race, the habits and the very language of the desert were already forgotten. Their commentaries reveal that much of the material with which they deal was incomprehensible to them, and this is the best guarantee for the antiquity of the text. Nevertheless a quantity of spurious stuff has* no doubt, found its way into such books as the Kitab AI Aghani and the Hamasa, and the genealogies composed with a view to proving the hieh descent of the Prophet and the early heroes of Islam are largely fantastic With the Muhammadan conquests, the centre of political interest was shifted to new seats of Arab power widely scattered from Spain to Persia ; the desert having made its supreme effort and left its mark on the history of civilization, sank back into its custo mary preoccupations-tribal feud and the problem of supply, always urgent for those who neither plough nor harvest and solved not infrequently by the simple, if wasteful expedient of ravaging the frontier lands and reaping where others have sown. There is little to be gathered of tribal movements during the middle ages ; historians are silent and the rude tnbe marks scored by the Bedouin on cliff or rocks are an inadequate substi tute for inscription and graffito. It was not until modern travel forced the door of unknown lands and peoples that the situation and grouping of nomadic confederations were noted and enquiry made into the reason of their presence and the length of their sojourn. Scanty as is our information, there yet emerge from it certain governing factorsin nomad history The most important of these is the unbroken drift northwards which from the earliest days affected Arabia. The underlying causes were probably complex. A gradual change in climatic conditions, involving slow dessication, the pressure of increas ing population on a soil growing ever poorer, and the opportunities for northern ex pansion offered by the weakness and political exhaustion of neighbouring Northern btates, whether they were Byzantine, Persian or Ottoman—these were probablv the mam lines along which an explanation may lie. Linked and interwoven in Arabian history with the northern trend of its peoples, is the division into two groups of one race but with different traditions, the southern and the northern Arabs—the Ahl Qibli or Muta ariba, and the Ahl Al Shimal or Musta'ariba—a division of which the tribes of to-day, far removed from their ancient seats, are still conscious. From these salient factors necessary corollaries are derived. Constant migration has left few of the tribes in their original positions. In the little known south of the peninsula certain confederations may have been very anciently established. The Qahtan the mother stock of the Ahl Qibli, still occupy the southern limits of the habitable desert In the Yemen and the Hejaz and on the Tihama coast there are remnants of old tribes once famous and powerful in these regions. The Hemyar, who dominated Yemen are to be found north of Sanaa ; the Qure\ sh, the tribe of the Prophet, exist in small numbers east of Mecca ; the Thaqif, who turned a deaf ear to Muhammad's appeal for assistance when he was left without support by the death of Khadija and Abu Talib are still clustered round Taif; the Juheyna and Bili had probably settled at a distant period in the Tihama and the mountainous country behind it—it is significant that their northern limit, the Jau, is known to-day as the boundary between Ahl Qibli and Ahl al Shimal • and the Bern Temim, who once held the whole of Central Arabia from the Syrian Desert to the Yemama, form to-day a great part of the settled population of the Central Arabian oases. But these and similar survivals are exceptional. Generally the old tribes must be sought on the northern edge of the area of migration, where they will be found half settled and forced to till the soil for want of the wide spaces needed for nomadic life 3 h 2 f420 BEDOUIN and camel breeding. Not infrequently they have been split up and the different sections separated by intruding confederations. Thus the Qeys and the Mawali, early-comers into Mesopotamia, are now dwellers in villages on its furthest con e nes. The Adwan charged in the Days of Ignorance with the duty of conducting pilgrims to Mina on the day of sacrifice, are present in the Hejez only in very small numbers ; they have been pushed up to the northern edges of the Belqa and the northern reaches of Mesopotamia. The Tai, whose fame was so great in further Asia that their name stood for the whole Arabian people, share the extreme north-eastern pasturages with Kurdish tribes. On the other hand, many of the great tribes of Arabian legend and history, Rabi'a, Taghlib, Bekr, Kinda, Ghassan and Lakhm have vanished, and the most powe ful nomadic con federations of to-day, Shammar, Anazeh, Beni Sakhr, Huweytat, Harb and Ateyba, though derived from ancient stocks, are not of ancient renown. The earliest references to the peninsula in Babylonian inscriptions of the 3rd mille- nium make mention of a power in Eastern Arabia which has been conjecutred to be the Minaean kingdom. It occupied the whole of southern Arabia, with its centre in the fertile Yemen, where Minaean inscriptions have been found which can be dated certainly before 800 B.C. and probably several hundred years earlier. From about 700 B.C. to 115 b.c. another southern kingdom, that of the Sabaeans, ruled the Yemen, and in- borited the trading colony of Minaeans, the land of Midian in north-westrn Arabia, where the Nabataeans, descendants of the Amaliq (Amalakites), began to develop an important commercial kingdom in the beginning of the 6th century before Christ. The Himyarites succeeded to the Sabaeans and dominated Southern Arabia till about 525 A.D. at which date their power was broken by the Abyssinian invasion. The slender data afforded by history concerning the Southern Arabian kingdom were magnified by tradi* tion and fable into a south Arabian Saga, leading up to the breach of the dam of Marib in the earlv centuries of our era, with the subsequent impoverishing of the land and migration of the Ahl Qibli northwards. In the immense uncertainty of tribal o igins, the genealogists of the 8th and 9th centuries constructed a system which accounted^ for the distinction oi the people of the south and the people of th3 north. Both were descended from Abraham, the former through Qahtan, the latter through Ishmael, Adnan, Maadd and Nizar. That the genealogical scheme was older than Islam is proved by the fact that Procopius mentions the Maadd tribes as a race of Saracens living north of the Himyar, and by the still older evidence of an inscription found at Nemara, east of the Safa, the language of which is Arabic, but the script Nabataen. In it Imrulqais, who corresponds without question to the second ruler of the Lakhmfd kingdom of Hira mentioned in Arab tradition, asserts that he was lord of the two Asads (i.e., the north Arab tribes of Asad and Tai) and of Nizar in the year 328 A. D. The traditional settlement of the Ishmaelite tribes at Mecca among the Jurham and Amaliq may have some historic basis in so far as it relates to an agreement arrived at between the older non-Arab inhabitant? and the Ahl A1 Shimal in the Hejaz. Long before the birth of the Prophet, the Tai were in occupation of Nejd, but until the middle of the 6th century of our era, the descendants of Maadd paid tribute to Yemen and the paramount rulers of Arabia were all of the Ahl Qibli. Towards the end of the 3rd century after Christ, the kingdom of Hira on the borders of Iraq began to make itself felt under a reigning house of the southern tribe of Lakhm. It played an essential part in the development of Arab civilization as the intermdiary between the settled lands and the desert and the transmitter of culture. At Hira, according to tradition, the Arabic script was first employed currently, and it is certain that it was in use there in the second ha 1 f of the 6th century though the literary language of Hira was Aramaic, and the two earliest Arabic inscriptions in existence, dated 512 A.D. and 568 A.D., were both found on the western side of the desert. It was the king of Hira Imrul Qais who laid claim in 328 A.D. to overlordship over Asad and Nizar. The Lakhmids of Hira were charged with the protection of the frontiers of the desert for the Sasanians ; their constant harry- inf of Byzantine territories suggested to Justinian the creation of an Arab phylarch on his Syrian Marches. Another tribe of the Ahl Qibli, the Bani Ghassan, settled on the borders of Syria since the 3rd century, was chosen to represent Rome and garrison the fortresses of its Limes. In Central Arabia the Kinda, rulers in their native Hadra- mout, extended their authority over all the Maadd tribes of Najd, but towards the middle of the 6th century the power of Kinda was broken by the Lakhmids, and about the same time the Himyarite kingdom was overthrown by the Abyssinians who were in-BEDOUIN 421 ^ 10Ils cited by Justin I to avenge the persecuted Christians of Najran. It was after the fall of Kinda that the Northern Arab tribes, such as the Ghatafan and the B. Temim, rose into ^ importance, but the authority of Hira was still recognised in Central Arabia. The two- great groups of Rabia and Mudhar had dissolved before the Muhammadan era and the ^ V Jealousy between their offshoots was so bitter that the Rabia tribes were frequently l11113 ' found in alliance with the Ahl Qibli against their Mudhar kinsmen. Fratricidal con- flicts between Bekr and Taghlib, Abs and Dhubyan rent Arabia and provided the poets On of the 6th century with endless themes of conflict and vengeance. There is no evidence hlib, of hereditary antagonism during the Age of Ignorance between the northern and the con- • southern tribes, indeed the Ahl ash Shimal submitted more willingly to the yoke of Yemen syoa, Kinda or Hira than to the pretentions of one of their own stock. It is probable that before the Age of the Prophet the division between the two groups was not of great fflille- account. Their subsequent hostility was rooted in the rivalry between the Qureysh be the of Mecca and the Ansar of Medina, the former being Muhammad's own tribe and des- in the cendants of Mudhar, the latter who invited the Prophet to flee from Mecca to Medina, rtainly were the representative of Aus and Khazraj, constituent of Azd and descended from S.C. to Qahtan. When the new faith had been universally accepted it was a disputed point md in- whether the greater honour lay in giving birth to the Prophet or in providing him with irabia, an asylum. At the time when this question was raised, i .e., in the days of the first bp an Khalifs, the activities of the compilers of genealogies had begun, and it was they who The were at pains to distinguish between the two groups and to assign each man of mark it 525 to one or to the other, thus emphasizing a division which was grounded mainly on reli- r data gious arguments. Islam brought automatically to an end all previous inter-tribal feuds tradi- but it fanned, if it did not create, the hostility between Yemenite and Maaddite which pervaded every part of the conquered territory where Arabs had settled and contributed d ail( j greatly to the downfall of Arab rule with the extinction of the dynasty of Umayah. oiffiug Maadd was represented especially by the Qeysite portion, the Hawazin and Ghatafan 'ounted* with whom were ranged the Temim. Even in Spain this hereditary enmity is a wer0 traceable all through the chequered history of Islam in that country. Although the main Islamic forces in Spain were always Berbers, the Amirs were often Arabs and they perpetuated tribal feuds. As if in preparation for a new political era, the century before the Hejra saw the ' eas |. 0 | Arabian stage cleard of those who had borne the title roles. Yemen was overthrown j - by the Abyssinians about 525, and to the Abyssinian authority succeeded that of ^ jjj ra ' Persia (Circa 579) which lasted till the land submitted to Islam. The greatness of Kinda ended about 529, when the family of Aqil A1 Morar was driven back from the Iraq by Mundhir III, king of Hira, Hira herself fell under Persia shortly after the death of Numan, the last of the Lakhmid dynasty, in 602, Ghassan lingered till the ^ Persian invasion of Syria in 613, At the time of the Prophet the grouping of the various ped at tribes of Arabia was as follows :—North of Aden were the various branches of the Long great tribe of Azd, In the Tihama, between the mountains and the sea, was the liddle tribe of Akk, and fractions of the Azd ran all up through the Sarat or meridional chain iMk of the Yemen to the neighbourhood of Taif, In the chain itself were the fortresses and entuty towns of the Himyarites, a Persian province, the Viceroy of which was named Badhan, Under To the east of the Sarat of the Yemen stretched the tableland of Nejran—in those days t in the the name was roughly used to include Bisha and Tabala which lay to the north of it. and the This region was held by Yemanite stocks, of which the most important were Hamdan, lie script Nahd, Khatham and the Bal Harith Ibn Kab, collectively known as Madhij. A second section of the Bal Harith were Christians, and had been persecuted by the last Himyarite [thetffo King, Dhu Nawas who had embraced Judaism, South of the Bal Harith were the th {ound Murad. Still further east lay the Yauf, a rich depression draining towards Hadramaut clainiia and occupied in mass by Kinda and its branches, of whom the most important were the i charged Sakun. Eastward of these were the people of Mahra, famous as camel breeders, but in ^ harry- other respects cut off from kinship with the great Yemenite stocks and by the wide rrjaroh on sands of the Ahqaf, from the rest of Arabia. Beyond Mahra lay Oman, inhabited by ;( 1 on the the Azd. pontile Turning round the shores of the Persian Gulf to the west of Cape Musandam lay the e land of Bahreyn, a name properly applicable to the peninsula of Qatar, washed on either , ar( j s the side by two seas. This shore was inhabited by the Abdul Qeys, a Maaddic stock akin to the Bekr Ibn Wail and Taghlib. The Abdul Qeys were divided into two portions— wer0 in. Lukeyz, the eastern, and Shann, the western. Their lands included Hufuf, and the f422 BEDOUIN fortress of Mushaqqar, held by a Persian Governor, on the coast between Qatar and Kadhhima (the present Koweyt). This region was called al Ahsa (nowHasa) from the readiness with which water could be got by digging shallow wells in the sand. Beyond the Abdul Qeys up to the head of the Persian Gulf were the great tribe of.Temim which extended far inland along the course of the Wadi ar Rumma into Qasim and Yemama. Temim was divided into a great number of septs, the most important being Yarbu, Darim and Sab ibn Zeyd Manat. It was porbably the largest aggregate of tribes in Maadd. Dwelling in close connection with Temim were the four tribes called collectively Ribab, of whom Dhabba and Teym were the chief. Inland from the Bahreyn coast the whole of the great complex of mountains looking down on the Persian Gulf was anciently called Yemama, a name which now applies only to the oasis which is the capital of the province of Kharj. This country had been previously to the war of Basus between Bekr and Taghlib (first quarter of the 6th century A.D. or end of the 5th), the home of those two great branches of Wail. The result of that war was that the main part of Bekr and the whole of Taghlib migrated from Yemama to the plains of Iraq, but one great division of Bekr, Hanifa, and another Smaller, Qeys ibn Tha'aba, remained behind in Yemama. The Hanifa have left their name to the Wadi Hanifa in the heart of IbnSaud 's territories* The portion of Yemama in the north vacated by Taghlib was occupied by Temim. To the west of Yemama, and south of the valley of the Rumma, stretched the great Maaddic group of Hawazin, of which Amir ibn Sasaa was the chief representative, XJqeyl and Jada, constituents of Amir Ibn Sasaa were in Southern Yemama about Falj (modern Aflaj), neighbours of Qeys Ibn Thalaba, and sections of Amir held settlements in Tabala and Bisha when they met the Yemenites of Madhhij. Further up the Wadi ar Rumma, the great group of Ghatafan (Abs and Bhtibyan with smaller elements of Ashja and Anmar) were opposed to Hawazin. This group lay along the line of volcanic Harrahs which fringed the trade route going north from Mecca and Medina, and were in close relations with the people of the oasis of Medina, formerly Yathrib. Beyond the Ghatafan, and between them and the range of Selma, the southernmost of the two ranges of Tai, was Asad. In the neighbouhood of Faid and the modern Hail the Temim came in, and about the modern Aneyza was the meet ing place of Amir Ibn Sasaa, Temim (Darim), Asad and Ghatafan (Abs and Fazara of Dhubyan). Turning to Mecca, the Heram or sacred area was occupied by Qureysh and Kinani,' Maaddite tribes, and about it Yemenite and Maaddite stocks came into contact. To the south were the Azd (Yemenite) touching Adwan and Fahm (Maddite), while the surrounding country was inhabited by Amir mixed with the Yemenite Khatham and Harith. To the north there was a branch of Hawazin called Suleym, and in theHejaz and Tihama, west of them, Hudheyb. Further north towards Medina, Qudhaite tribes of Yemenite origin, Juhena, Salaman and Bili were cantoned along the Tihama and Hejaz. The oasis of Yathrib (Medina) was inhabited by the Yemenite tribes of Aus and Khazraj, offshoots of Ghassan, but the main body of Ghassan went further north into the Syrian desert, where, under the house of Yafna, they held the Roman border until the Persian invasion. Other Yemenite groups in this direction (also from Qudhaa) were Udhra, Judham and the great tribe of Kelb, which occupied the oasis of the Wadi Al Qura and the Yauf, north of the Nefud. The Syrian desert was held by the Kalb (Qudhaa) and Ghassan (Azd) with some ancient immigrants— (1) The famous Qudhaa stock is a good example of the uncertainty as to tribal origins. It is placed by some among the constituents of Himyar, and by others among those of Maadd. The same uncertainty prevails to-day. Every man of the Anazeh will claim descent from Wail, while the genealogists give their descent from Asad, who with Wail was among the constituents of Rabia of whom the Bahra (Qudhaa) were the most important. All these were Yemenites. According to Arab tradition the first Arab tribe to move up into Mesopotamia was Qudhaa, who established themselves at Hatra about 200 A. D. Some of the Maaddite tribes are said to have pushed up between the rivers earlv in the 4th century, and the Iraq held chiefly Maaddite stocks Taghlib, Bekr, Namir Ibu Qasit and lyad. Rabia and Mudhar gave their name to two provinces in the extreme north, the one on the Tigris, the other on the Euphrates, and the fame of the Bekr is perpetuated in the nameBEDOUIN 423 Diyarbekr. The northern tribes were mostly Christian in the Prophet's time. Rough ly speaking the Syrian desert and Mesopotamia were peopled by the Ahl A1 Ghimal, Syria by the Ahl Qibli. In the year 9 A.H. (the year of Deputations) nearly all the inhabitants of the penin sula south of the Syrian desert and Iraq submitted themselves to Muhammad, but on his death in A. H. 11 they fell away, a defection known as the Ridda. By the help of Khalid and his army of the Ansar of Medina, Abu Bekr succeeded in bringing them back to obedience. Then set in the wars of conquest. On the Persian border these were chiefly waged by the Maaddites, Bekr and Temim. In Syria the armies were greatly mixed. Asad and several tribes of Ghatafan had forfeited their lands during the Ridda and went northwards into Syria. Asad diverged to Kufa, where their head quarters still exist. The Bal Harith also participated in the conquest of Iraq, while Khurasan was strongly held by the Temim. In Egypt Amr's army was very largely composed of Yemenites, Akk and Sakun of Kinda, but these also took part in the Iraq operations. One relic of the Yemenite occupation of Egypt is the pronunciation of the letter jim as hard G. The first conquest of North Africa was carried out by a very mixed force of Yemenites and Maaddites, the latter probably preponderating. But in the conquest and settlement of Spain (where all the Arab tribes were represented) the main body of troops were Berbers, not Arabs. The Arabization of North Africa, which had previously been only thinly peopled by Arabs, was really due to the invasion of the Beni Hilal, a branch of Amir Ibn Sasaa mixed with elements of Suleym and of Hawazin. This occurred in the 11th century A. D., but Suleym had also taken part previously with Temim in the settlement of Khurasan. It was probably on the tide of the first conquest that the Tai pressed up into the borders of Syria and the Qeys, Khazraj, Beni Temim and Beni Lam flooded Iraq and Mesopotamia. The movements of the tribes during the later middle ages are unrecorded. When the Shammar came up into the Syrian desert in the middle of the 17th century they found there a multiplicity of nomadic groups such as the Amur and Haddin, among whom the Mawal were predominant. These last were driven into the north-west bor ders of Syria, to the east of Aleppo and Hama, where they are still to be found. The Anazeh followed close upon the heels of the Shammar and established themselves in the Hamad, while the Shammar of the Syrian desert retired north-east across the Tigris, driving the Tai before them into the pasturages north of Jebel Sinjar. The Jebur, Baqqara, Weldeh and Aqeydat were thrust back on to the rivers and obliged to cultivate the arable land along the valleys. Like all the half settled tribes their num bers have become considerable. Nor can the developments which resulted in the present geographical position of the great tribes in Central Arabia be traced back earlier than the middle of the 17th century. That period saw the birth of the Wahhabi sect, and before the end of the century the family of the Beni Saud had embraced the doctrines and founded an Amirate in Nejd which maintained almost unbroken authority for 150 years, and has once again risen into prominence. In the early years of the 19th century the Wahhabis invaded the Hejaz and sacked the Holy Cities, Mecca and Medina. Their strength alarmed Muhammad Ali of Egypt, the most powerful Mohammadan ruler in the immediate neighbourhood of Arabia, and his son Ibrahim Pasha was charged with an expedition to overthrow the Beni Saud. He marched into Arabia from the Mesopotamian side, harried Nejd, burnt the oasis towns and returned to Egypt through the Hejaz, leaving the Beni Saud to reconstitute tHeir position. The northern provinces slipped gradually from their grasp. By the middle of the century a Shammar Sheykhly family, the Beni Rashid, [ : who had been the representatives of the Amir of Riyadh in Jebel Shammar, had thrown off allegiance to him and created an independent Amirate. The fifth ruler of this house, Muhammad Ibn Rashid,who was the most remarkable man of his day in Arabia, conso lidated Shammar authority, extended it over the oasis of the Qasim and finally drove the Saud out of Nejd and established an agent of his own in their capital, Riyadh. At the height of his power Muhammad held not only Nejd and the Qasim, but also the nomad tribes from Hail to the Hajj road, and controlled with tolerable success the western desert almost up to the Syrian frontier. The possession of the oasis of Jauf A1 Amir, north of the Nefud, gave him a strong post upon the road to Damascus, but east of the Wadi Sirhan his authority ceased—the great northern Anazeh Confederation has always been a match for the Shammar. Muhammad entered into friendly relations with424 BEDOUIN the Ottoman Government, and since his day Hail has been treated by the Turks as a base for diplomatic operations in Arabia, and a centre for Ottoman influence. On his death in 1897 the power he had created fell to pieces. With the help of the Amir of Kuweyt, Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud returned to Riyadh and wrested from the Rashid family, crippeled by internal jealousy and division, all that Muhammad had won. He is now paramount in Eastern Arabia and Nejd. The oases of the Qasim, all but Aneyza which maintains independence, pay him tribute and give him military service ; in 1913 he reoccupied the Hasa, driving the Turks out of their last posts on the coast of the Persian Gulf, and this district has been recognised by the British Government as a part of his dominions. To the south-west the Qahtan come under his authority and most of the Dawasir, but to the west he meets a powerful rival in the Sherif of Mecca who since 1910 has claimed tribute from the whole of the great Ateyba tribe up to the province of Sedeyr, To the north of the Ateyba, the Harb, who extend from the shores of the Red Sea to Jebel Shammar, are controlled by this Sherif in the Hejaz, but since the decay of the Rashid the Harb Sheykhs of the central deserts have recognised no authority but their own. East of Jebel Shammar, the Muteyr are closely linked both with Ku 1 eyt and with Riyadh, but the Dhufir have no fixed relations, save a lasting feud with the Shammar which induces general amity, though rarely co-operation, with the Saud group. The Muntefik, though half settled, play some part in the politics of the desert. They are generally in alliance with the Shammar against the Dhufir, but maintain good terms with Kuweyt. North of the Nefud lies a different political area. The Anazeh are united by ties of blood with a great part of the settled population of Nejd—Ibn Saud himself is accounted by some to be of Anazeh descent—but they are not concerned with Central Arabian wars, and their hereditary hostility to the Shammar does not lead to any union on their part with Ibn Saud against Ibn .Rashid. Tribal organization is not favourable to large com bined operations, nor are the means of supply and communication such as would facili tate their execution. In the same way the Shammar of Mesopotamia, of one blood with the Southern Confederation and always on terms of friendship with them, do not share in their fortunes or help them against their enemies. It must be borne in mind that though the rulers of the oases claim and, to a certain extent, enforce authority over the nomad groups, their domination is always of a very uncertain character. Ibn Saud strongly established in Nejd and fairly powerful in Hasa, maintains his grip on the Ajman only by a series of raiding expeditions ; the Sherif of Mecca gathers tribute from the eastern Ateyba at the sword's point, and Ibn Rashid harries the outlying Sherarat, when he has leisure, in order to collect a camel tax which is invariably in arrears. Unstable as their own sands,the tribes bow to superior force when they have no other alternative, but as soon as the strong hand is withdrawn or relaxed, all semblance of unity vanishes and they go back to their private feuds, to raiding and reiving after the manner of their ancestors from the beginning of time. Such men as Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud or the .Sherif Huseyn Ibn Ali, who are now the most powerful chiefs in Arabia, exercise a fleeting authority over the desert, based on personal predominance, but the elements of permanence are never present. The Sherif alone has a religious position independent of whatever tribal paramouncy he may at any time enjoy. As the descendant of the Qureysh, the tribe of the Prophet, he has claims to the Khalifate of Islam, and as guardian of the Holy places he must always play a part in the Mohammadan world to which no other Arabian chief can aspire. These qualifications may enable him to assume a leading role in Islam, and are clearly recog nised and feared by the Ottoman Government, but they are of far greater moment out side Arabia than within the peninsula, where he is but one of several rival chiefs, each of whom makes certain pretentions to a peculiar sanctity, while each depends, as far as the coercing of the tribes is concerned, on the amount of temporal force with which he can back his claims. For the moment that which the Sherif has at his disposal is consider able, while that of Ibn Saud is possibly as great, and the two regard each other with jealous anxiety. The Shammar have suffered for the last 19 years from the lack of a competent leader and their connection with Constantinople, though advantageous to themselves since it has brought them small subsidies, gifts of arms and in 1904-05 some (singularly ineffective) military support, has roused suspicion and resentment in Arabia, but they are still a numerous and martial tribe holding their own against Nejd, with a proud tradition, and the wealth—such as wealth is in the desert—both of the nomadBEDOUIN 425 and of the oasis dweller. A determined ruler might raise them once more to the stand ing which they enjoyed under Muhammad, and their geographical position, as the north ernmost of the Arabian confederations, in touch alike with Damascus (through the Hajj Railway) and with Baghdad, must always make them of importance to the rulers of the settled lands on either side. It was not without reason that the Turks courted their friendship. The Ottoman Government has no hold over the tribes of Central Arabia, The tribes along the Hajj Railway are entrusted with the task of protecting the line, a duty most inadequately performed, and receive in return a yearly subsidy, but except in the case of Sukhur and Huweytat, who are nominally within the limits of the Vilayat of Damas cus, official authority is of a purely nominal kind. All the great Sheykhs of the Syrian desert and Mesopotamia are subsidised and the Sheykhs of the Harb have also been in ' receipt of a yearly subsidy from time immemorial. In the north, the Syrian desert and Northern Mesopotamia, the Anazeh chiefs have no rivals, nor are they likely to be affected by any developments south of the Nefud. Authority is divided between Nuri Ibn Shalan, paramount Sheykh of the Ruwalla, Hakim Ibn Muheyd of the Fedan and Fahd Ibn Hadhdhal of the Amarat. Nuri is the controlling influence on the Syrian side of the desert. Hakim in the north and Fahd on the borders of Iraq. Of these three Nuri is the most striking personality and must be reckoned at present the most powerful purely nomad chief, whether in the north or in Arabia proper. Internal bickerings and private feuds are constant among the Anazeh, as in all tribal groups, but there are no enmities between the great Sheykhs such as would involve one of the septs in war with the other. Neither is there any consistent political or military union ; such a conception is foreign to the nomad mind and would imply a discipline to which the wandering tribesman has never submitted and a concen trated organization which the physical conditions of his existence do not permit. That tribal life is incompatible with political unity is the underlying lesson of Arabian history, indeed it may be doubted whether a prolonged adherence to the tribal system does not imply the incapacity of the race which is content to abide by it for developing more stable institutions. It is at least certain that the Arabs have not been successful in maintaining administrative independence for any great length of time. Except in Spain, where another racial element came into play, the administration of Arab States has invariably passed into alien hands, and Turk, Circassian, Kurd or European has governed countries which, though they had reached a high stage of social, intellectual and religious culture—not infrequently a stage considerably higher than that of their rulers—exhibited a want of political cohesion and executive capacity which left the door open to foreign adventure. Under modern conditions a number of tribes have found themselves obliged bo settle down upon the land and become cultivators along the Mesopotamian rivers and upon the borders of Syria and the Iraq. They relinquish nomad life with reluctance, tribal law and custom they do not give up, and tribal blood feuds continue to be a terrible scourge and seriously hinder progress. They think nothing of periodical reversions to tents, and even the villages are nomadic and are shifted easily from site to site. But the rising value of land tends to pin down these restless husbandmen. No sooner do they settle than their numbers increase with great rapidity—without counting the population of Iraq, and excluding also the inhabitants of towns, .such as Deyr Al Zor or Tekrit, there must be along the two great Mesopotamian rivers or their tributaries at least 45,000 families of tribal settlers, a figure which throws even the most powerful of nomadic confederations into the shade. The Anazeh group, the largest aggregate of nomads, ranging the whole of the Syrian desert as well as Northern Mesopotamia, does not in all probability number as many as 20,000 tents, while in Central Arabia the figures fall yet lower and a powerful tribe like the Ateyba may not consist of more than 5,000 to 6,000 tents. Desert pasturages will not support a larger population. In reckoning the fighting value of nomad tribes, it must be remembered that, though every man can ride a camel and almost every man carries arms, only a small proportion will go on military expeditions. Enough must always be left behind to guard herds and tents, for Arabia lives unceasingly in a state of war. Even among warlike con federations, to count upon a fighting man for the tribal levies from every tent {i .e., family) would be too many. Half the number would be nearer the figure. Moreover C52(w)GSB 3!426 BED-BEY these armies, once levied, will speedily melt again. The commissariat is limited to what a man can carry on his camel, and a victory is as fatal to discipline as a defeat, for each of the victors will hasten home to place in safety the booty he has won.

BITAIRAH (Tract and Canal)— A stream running almost due south from the Tigris (right bank) about 2 miles north of Shaikh Shabib, emptying itself into the Hor in the Al Bu Azairij country. On the right or west bank is the Muqata'ah of the Al Bu Darraj (Gassat-ash-Sharqi). The Hor Gassat-ash-Sharqi is enclose by the Al Bu Darraj lands. Al Khazainah and Al Hamish tract lies at the foot the Bitairah before it enters the big khor, on the right bank with Hor Gassat-ash-Sharqi on its north, the Bitairah on the east, the big Bitairah Hor on its south and the desert Jazirah on the west; devoted to wheat and barley cultivation. Abu Siba or Baghdad Tufaijiyah. '• ! On left bank of the Bitairah, the Abu Hallanah Muqata 'ah reaches down to the Tomb of Madhosh about half way between the point where the Bitairah leaves the Tigris and the Hor. The first 'Azairij land is that watered by the Abu Siba, a large canal taking off about 5 miles from the Tigris. The greater part of its length is rice land. The land watered by the Abu Siba is known as Baghdad Tufaijyah,(224) BITAIRAH 453 'Awaiji and Chalbath. 'AwaijI and Chalbat; a tract comprising the lands of Rughl, Nishabah, Gusamah and Ra 'ash, the last and southernmost of which borders on the great Bitairah Hor. It ie part wheat, part barley, part rice, watered by the big branches called Shak-er-Riyat about 5 miles from the Tigris, and Talaa about 7 miles from the Tigris. Umm-uch-Chir and Bdh-al-Hawa, The Bitairah Hor is about 6 miles broad but nowhere except immediately below the Bitairah is it more than about 1 foot in depth. At about 4 miles east, south-east from the debouchure of the Bitairah the Umm-uch-Chir takes off from the northern bank of the Bitairah Hor and forms the south-eastern boundary of the Ra 'ash lands watering a large rice tract. It runs towards the north-east, and falls into a Aor half way between the Tabar or Majar-as-Saghir, and the Bitairah. Large mashhvfs can pass up the Umm-uch-Chir channel across this central hor and up the Khubaiyir (one of the branches of the Tabar). The mouth of the Umm-uch-Chir is badly silted up from the floods of 1915. • At about 4 miles from the Umm-uch-Chir entrance the big channel of the Bab-al- Hawa, takes off from the north (eastern ?) bank, of the Bitairah Hor and runs north east into the Hor Jindalah at the bottom of the Jindalah, the most westerly branch of the Majar-al-Kabir. There is a through connection for big mashhufs between tho Bitairah Hor, by the Bab-al-Hawa into the Majar-al-Kabir. On the south shore of the board Bitairah Hor opposite the Umm-uch-Chir and Bab-al- Hawa lands, and separated from them by 6 or 7 miles of water, is a large rice tract entirely surrounded by water comprising Karachi, Haddam, and Abu Dhahab. The principal place is Haddam where resides a slave of Shaway as his agent. A mound of ruins close to Haddam where gold ornaments or coins are often found after rain, gives its name to Abu Dhahab. The whole of the Karaichi-Haddam-Abu Dhahab tract is liable to submergence and has to be protected against the Bitairah Hor by expensive dykes formed of clay, rice straw and reeds. Umm-az-Zora and Laqaqah. Umm-az-Zora is a long island lying in the middle of the Bitairah Hor to the north-west of Haddam. It is intersected by numerous channels and mostly covered with tamarkk having also a certain amount of rice cultivation. Laqaqah, is a very extensive rice tract lying south-west of Khazinah arid almost due west of Umm-az-Zora from which it is separated by a comparatively narrow strip of hor. It abuts on the desert Jazirah. Like Haddam it has to be protected by expensive d5^kes. Cereal lands of 'Audah and Shatlaniyah {Bardah, Buraidah, Dawaimah, Al-Bazun, Al-Aisa), South of the main Bitairah Hor, and partially screened from it by the Haddam block, lies the smaller Hor-at-Tafra. Round the shores of the latter lie the extensive wheat, barley and millet lands known as 'Audah ; they are, beginning from the north, Bardah' Buraidah, Al-Bazun and Al'Aisa. The Muntafiq tribe of Al-Bajun under Shaikh Falih ibn Abu 'Oja cultivate them. The 'Audah lands seem to be at present (Februarv 1916) entirely submerged. Shattaniyah is a large isolated tract, lying on the southern side of the Bitairah Hor, about 10 miles to south-east of Haddam, and forms the extreme outpost of cultivation in the tail-lands or hazayiz of the Bitairah. It is separated from the Hor-at-Tafra by about 12 miles of desert called Al-Khidhr, which is dotted with ruined mounds called 'Al-Hiffa or Huffa. The soil here is very rich and has two crops yearly, one millet and the other wheat and barley. Shattaniyah is protected against the hor by exceptionally big dykes faced with camel-thorn. Bitairah watering. It seems evident that the flow of the water in the Bitairah might be diminished and regulated with advantage. Not only is the rice cultivation liable to be swamped, but the extensive barley and wheat crops in 'Audah and Shattanyiah are often drowned. The Al-Bn-Darraj Muqata'as lie on the right bank of the Tigris between the 'Azairii Muqata as of Majar-as-Saghir (on the Tabar and Bitairah rivers) to the east, and the „ r „ an ' ^ s ' rl Muqata'as of 'Ali Gharbi and Gutba beyond the Dnjailah river on the fm BITAIRAH north-west. To the south-west they are bounded by the desert Jazirah stretching to the Hai, while due south is the Muqata'ah of 'Audah Shattaniyah. There is a comparatively small enclave round the town of Kumait on the Tigris which forms the Muqata 'ah of Gassat-al-Gharbi. Probably | of the apparent area of the Muqata'ahs is taken up by the two immense hores or shallow lakes, the Hor G assat- esh-Sharqi on the east, fed by the Saf aah and Safaihah channels from the Tigris, and by the channels from the Bitairah, and the Hor Ataiiiyah on the west, fed mainly by channels from the Dujailah river. These hors contract and expand with the volume of water in the Tigris and its channels, and have to be restrained by a vast system of dykes from flooding the comparatively narrow river of cultivated land round them. When they contract after the summer floods, excellent crops of millet are grown in the damp soil left bare. Rice cannot be cultivated in them, because their waters do not hold enough of the silt essential to rice cultivation. They contain no reeds, the reeds having, it is said, been killed by excessive flood about the year 1903. There is in the winter a strip of dry land between the Hor Gassat-ash-Bharqi and the Bitairah river and between the Hor Ataifiyah and the Hor Gassat-esh-Sharqi—but in the summer the two/tor# coalesce and avast sheet of water stretches uninterruptedly from the Dujailah to the Bitairah. The rim round the hors is devoted to wheat and barley in the winter and spring and to millet in the autumn, the only rice land being a small tract near Kumait. The Gassat-esh-Sharqi Muqata'ah consists of the strip immediate^ north of the Hor Gassat-esh-Sharqi between the hor and the Tigris which is watered by the Safhah and Safaihah canals. The name Gassat-esh-Sharqi is only an official name^and the tract is locally known is Saihah Safaihah. It is about a mile broad in the cold weather and grows good barley and wheat crops. There is practically no cultivation on the strip between Hor Gassat-esh-Sharqi and the Bitairah river, which is salt land apparently covered with tamarisk. The Jazrah Muqata'ah comprises all the lands on the south of the Hor? Gassat-esh- Sharqi and Ataifiyah between them and the Jazirah desert. These lands, beginning from the east, and named Khazainah and Al-Hamish, Jif jafah, Jafijafat (a barren tract) Tel Dukhn and Harair. (a.) Khazainah and Al-Hamish. —These lands form a peninsula jutting out from the desert Jazirah between the Hor Gassat-esh-Sharqi on the north and the big Bitairah Hor on the south, with the Bitairah in the east.

(c) Tel Dukhn. —A large stretch of arable land 8 miles by 3 miles bordering on Hor Ataifiyah, It contains a series of mounds of ancient bricks and pottery, and several sweet-wells. Very fertile, but the greater part of it is flooded by the breaking of dykes every second or third year, and when this happens the cultivation of it is abandoned, and Harair, the tract beyond it, is cultivated instead. (d) Harair lies immediately to the north-west of Tel Dukhn, but contains higher ground.

Boundaries. —On the coast Biyadh reaches from the cape off which lies Abu 'Ali island in the north to Ras-as-Safairah, a promontory opposite the south end of Zakhnuniyah island on the south—a distance of 130 miles. Biyadh is bounded on the north by the tract called Huzum; on the west of it lie in succession from north to south the tracts of Jau Shamin, Habl, Jauf, Badd-al-AsTs and the Hasa Oasis; on the south it meets Jafurah inland and Barr-al-Qarah near the coast. The maximum breadth of Biyadh is between the sea and Habl where it amounts to about 60 miles. The Qatif Oasis, which lies upon the coast about midway between the two ends of Biyadh, is regarded as a separate tract, surrounded on the landward side by Biyadh but not forming a part of it. Certain other areas also, which fall within the limits above described, but are distinguished by names and characteristics of their own, are scarcely to be taken as included in the term Biyadh ; these are dealt with in separate articles and their names will be found in the following paragraph. f436 BIYlDH Physical characteristics and divisions, —■Biyadh, considered generally, is a tract of light- coloured sandy soil and abounds in low white sandhills called Naqiyan. Qasba Subat and Thama n are among the grasses, and 'Andal, Rashad and Tarfah are among the shurbs which grow, and they are found in great profusion. Almost everywhere water is obtainable by digging a very few feet beneath the surface, and the Bedouins say that the wells of Biyadh are numbered 44 by thousands.' There are several areas which call for notice as differing in character from the rest of the tract. The northern most of these is the Sabakhat-as-Summ, a large saline plain or nitrous depression covered with sandhills, which almost reaches the sea in the neighbour hood of Jabal Dhalaifain and extends inland for many miles with a very considerable breadth. To the south of it, and divided from it only by a narrow strip of the ordinary Biyalh, is a second Sabakhahof similar character known as Sabakhat 8alalyat • on the east this marsh nearly touches the confines of the Qatif Oasis. The two areas contain- ing the best groups of wells in Biyadh are known as Dabaisi and Hushum and have their centres respectively 10 miles south-west and 30 miles west by south of Qatif Town Next to these in excellence are two coastal strips, the Barr-adh-Dhahran which extends from the Qatif Oasis to the large bay of Dohat Ruhum, and the Barr-al-'Oqair which reaches southwards from Dohat Ruhum to the end of the Biyadh tract. The least inviting part of Biyadh after the Sabakhahs is said to be Habail, a region some miles in extent which is traversed at 30 or 40 miles from Hofiif on the route to Qatif Town • water is obtainable, however, and Bedouins sometimes encamp here. Jau-al-Aial is a small similar tract between Jubail-al-Barri and Qasr A1 Subaih. Features and wells.—¥ov the purpose of more minute description it is necessary to divide Biyadh into the following parts I. The part north of Sabakhat-as-Summ. II. The part between Sabakhat-as-Summ and Hushum, Babaisi and the Qatif Oasis. III. The part between Hushum, Dabaisi, and Jauf. IV. The part between Dabaisi on the west and the Qatif Oasis and Barr-adh- Dhahran on the east. V. The pait iiland of D5hat Ruhum. VI. The pait wastwards and south-westwards of Barr-al-'Oqair. Each of these artificial divisions we now proceed to describe; but Hushum Dabaisi Barryadh-DhahraQ and Barr-al-^Oqair-whether they ought to be regarded as belonging to Biyadh or only as enclosed by it—are dealt with separately under their own names • and so, of course, is the Hasa Oasis.

The only considerable feature of the division of Biyadh that lieslnland of Barr-al- 'Oqair is a nitrous marshy depression, known as Sabakhat Shatar, which is close to the eastern border of the Hasa Oasis and has its centre about 30 miles south-west of 'Oqair Port. The length of this depression from north to south is probably 20 mites, and its breadth where it is crossed by the route between 'Oqair and Hofuf is 4 miles ; it is fairly clear of sand and the surface is covered with saltpetre. The principal Bedouin camping grounds with wells in this division are :— Name. 'Alah Athlah (Umm) Baraiman' Vernacular equivalent. Bisaitm Bannan DhaiT( Umm-adh-) Position.

The north- em half of the tract is understood to belong to the Bani Khalid and the remainder to the 'Ajman ; but when, as at present, the two tribes are on terms of amity the Bedouins of both make use indifferently of the entire tract. The Bani Hajir also visit Biyadh under the auspices of the 'Ajman. BIYADHAH— See Aflaj. BIYADIYAH— A name given to the Carmathians of 'Oman from their distinguishing badge, a white turban. It is now applied to all inhabitants of 'Oman. With the relics of Sabaen practice and a ground-work of Carmathian free-thinking, they mix certain modifications derived from Muhammadan law. They have azdrs or buildings set apart for religious veneration, but they very rarely assemble for any form of worship. Their prayers are muttered in an inaudible voice accompanied by inflexions and pro strations, different from those employed in Muhammadan devotion ; many turn to the north and others in other directions. Their annual fast lasts a month, and is of even greater strictness than the Muhamma dan, and only one meal is taken in the 24 hours. They have one legal wife, the remainder being concubines. The laws of inheritance give male and female equal shares. ' ' The Biyadlyah are a compound of Sabaeans, Batiniyah and Carmathians, and are inheritors of Muqan'a, Abu Tahir, and Janabi. In this tribe a father usually confers freedom on his children, even if born of a slave.— {Palgrave.) BIYAQ— See Samail (Wadi).BIZ—BOS 445 BIZAILI—• See Dhahirah.

Wadi Boshar is celebrated for its hot springs of which the best and most frequented for medical baths are those at the village of Ghallah : there is a spring also at one of the Misfahs but it is too hot for use. In 1888 Barghash Sultan of Zanzibar, who was then suffering from a fatal disease, visited 'Oman chiefly with the object of bathing in the Boshar springs. The distance of the nearest part of Boshar by road from Matrah is seven or eight miles. &amp; BOSHAR BIN 'AMRAN.— A village in Wadi Boshar (g. v.), BOSRA-AL-HARlRL— A small village in Hauran, Syria, lying near the south-western edge of the lava tract known as the Lejah, and at a distance of about 7 miles from the station of Ezra, on the Hejaz railway.

The town is intersected by two main streets, one running east and west, and the other north and south. The former was the principal thorough fare, and was flanked by columns. On the left, outside the well-preserved west gate, is a small guard-house. A little way to the left, inside the gate is a spring, adjoining which is a low-lying meadow. Outside the wall on the eastern side of the town lies a large reservoir with tolerably preserved substructions ; a larger reservoir near the south east corner of the town, is in still better preservation. The population of Bosra-eski- Sham is about 1,500 inhabitants, including a small garrison of variying strength. The town was occupied by Turkish troops during the Druz rebellion in the autumn of 1910. j The water-supply is from wells and springs, and is good and abundant.

BURAIDAH— One of the two great towns of Qasim, in central Arabia, the other being 'Anaizah Buraidah is situated about 7 miles from the left bank of the Wadi-ar-Rummah, and stands in a sandy depression with sand dunes some 40 or 50 feet high along the west ern side. Between these sand dunes and the town is a dense belt of date plantations. On this side the sand is encroaching, and walls have to be built to keep it out. Tne sub-soil is clay, but in some places there are strata of sandstone near the surface. The town is surrounded by a strong mud wall 15 feet high with towers at intervals. On the north and south sides this wall is about 200 yards long, and on the other two. about 400 yards. There is one gate in each wall. On the north-east side lies a mud- built castle in which Ibn Sa'ud is reported to maintain a garrison of 400 men. It hm walls 40 feet high, with towers. At the north-west corner of the town there is an ancient watch-tower, which is well-known. The inhabitants of Buraidah number about 10,000 souls. They are of small stature, and are sallow-faced ; they wear scanty beards, and are inclined to be fanatical. They have good business capabilities, and are fond of travel, many of the townspeople having visited Baghdad, Damascus, and Egypt. There are wells in most of the houses ; the water is clear and sweet, and lies at a depth of about 30 feet.452 BUE-BUR The groves of date palms are very extensive, and ordinary fruit trees are numerous. Considerable quantities of cereals such as wheat, barley, and gaymi are raised amongst the palm trees, and lucerne is also largely grown. Irrigation is from wells. Livestock comprises camels, donkeys, and a few horned cattle. At the present time there are practically no horses, the stock having become exhausted during the continued struggle between the central Arabian powers.

The camel breeding tribes in Arabia are as follows : — In the North the Ruwalla, Fedan, Amarat and Sba. These four Anazeh tribes are ^ famous breeders, and their herds are larger than those in any other .1, T^ ^eni Salihr and Huweytat rear camels, but in smaller numbers, Ihe bhammar of the Jezireh (Mesopotamia) are poor in camels. In Central Arabia, the Shammar of J. Shammar, the 'Ateyba, the Qahtan and the Dawasir. Of these the most renowned camel-breeders are the Qahtan though they cannot rival the Anazeh. Some of the Harb, the sub-tribes of the Beni Salim and the Bern All, are camel owners. Mn'L^tr Arabia, the Muteyr, the Ajman, to a lesser extent, the Dhufir and the M rra. The Menasir, south of the Hurra on the edge of the great sand desert, have nri? ame a are se ^ om S€en by the merchants of the Qasim. The camel trade has its centre in Damascus where almost all the capital is supplied. The principal merchants are Muhammad A1 Bassam, a native of the Qasim, who until Abdullah H^W ^ ^ hand ' Yasim A] Dhi ^ b ' S ^wah Ibn Rawwaf, 4 Se brmg into SOQ—400 raiyahs, i.e., 24,000— JuwovH a Z' S ;h, r T 0116 M l WO d f aelrS in Ba S hda ' 1 . such as Assafiand Dand Ibn near the T^n nviffl t fv' 1 ^ 8 ^mber of bcatste.

They 0 brina the camels either to Damascus and so down into Egypt, or in small numbers across Sinaf C32MGSB S ' buy from Central Arabia, come down across the Nefud to f458 CAMEL TEADE OF ARABIA t^he Shammar, the Wulud Suleyman and the Aida (these two last have not y however,- many camels), and return by the same road, taking a Shammar rafiq with them. The largest number of camels come from the Anazeh. Like the Nejd camels, they are bought in the summer when prices are lowest, and the same Ageyli, who has come up from Nejd, with his two or three raiyehs in the early summer, may be employed to buy from the Anazeh in the neighbourhood of Damascus. He will go down to the Jolan or to the Eastern Belqa near Qasr A1 Azraq where the Ruwalla are to be found, or to the pasturages round Homs and Hama, to buy from the Haseneh and the Sba. The Fedan must be followed into the Jezireh, where they camp in Summer in the Khabur valley; the Amarat are mostly on the Euphrates near Museyib at that season. The purchasing of camels is done through one of the Sheykhs ; the Ageyl buyer lives in his tent, and the Sheykh sees that the animals are delivered at a fair price. In return for his help and protection he receives a rial on every camel purchased. A Sheykh who- attempts to raise his fee runs the risk of losing his custom, and unless he has sufficient authority with his people to ensure fair dealings and safe transit, he will be avoided by buyers. The Huweytat are in bad odour on this account. A Sheykh will not willing^ ly sell to any but his own buyer, lest on a succeeding year he should lose his markets He prefers the man he knows and has harboured Jrearly^ There is no camel trade through the Hejaz ; the mountainous character of the country makes it unsuitable for camel traffic. The tribes between the Qahtan district and the Hejaz, Sbei, Shalawa and Bugum are sheep-breeders. The tribes along the coast, Juheyna, Bili and Atiyeh, do not rear camels ; they keep them only in sufficient quanti ties for their own transport purposes and for milk. Nor are the Harb on the coast camel-breeders. The Ahamda, one of their principal sub-tribes, are camel drivers, and carry on the transport trade between Mecca, Medina and the sea. The price of camels has more than doubled during the last 15 or 20 years. The Average price is now £T 8 a head, the expenses of the journey come to another £T 1, and the camel is sold in Damuscus for £T 10, leaving a profit ot £T 1. The ultimate market is Egypt which takes an average of 32,000 camels yearly. The Egyptian Government raises a duty on every camel entering the country, and the number of imported camels is, therefore, accurately registered. This figure represents the whole of the yearly camel trade with the exception of 7,000—8,000 beasts sent every year to Asia Minor, and a smaller demand, both for meat and for agricultural purposes, from Syria^ Mesopotamia and Arabistan, which may be put at about 5,000 camels Annually. It would be impossible to arrive at an accurate estimat of the camels in Arabia^ but a rough approximation based on Arab figures may be attempted. The herds of the Northern Anazeh, who are the tribes richest in camels, may amount to as much as 300,000 head. This would include breeding camels, and those not yet fit for service- A camel is not reckoned fit for work until it is six years old, and its best years are from six to twelve. The Shafnfrial' of Jebel Shammar may have about 80,000. The herds of the Amir himself do not number much more than 1,000, The Mutej^r 60,000—' 70,000, the Dhufir 20,000—30,000, but all authorities agree that the Qahtan are except tionalll - rich in camels and their herds may run to 100,000 head or even more.- The? Amir Ibn Saud, who draws his supplies chiefly from the Qahtan, Dawasiiv Muteyr^ Sbei and Skihul, is said to have 4,000 good riding camels. The Ateyba are' not so re-' nowned as the Qahtan for camel breeding, but their numbers cannot beunder 80,000y and are probably more. The Harb must be estimated at about 50,000 to 60,000, the Sukhur and the Huweytat at 20,000 and 10,000, respectively. The Iraq yields no camels. The Muntafik and the tribes along the two rivers are cultivators ; few of them oWii camels even for agricultural purposes, their livestock consisting of sheep and goats^ ■jThe Duleym are sheep-breeders^ and supply the Damuscus market. The Shammar of the Jezireh are said not to have more than about 10,000 camels ; their Sheykhs remain fairly stationary within small areas, whereas the owner of great camel herds must be continuously on the move. The Kurdish tribes of the Northern Jezireh rear flocks of sheep and are visited by the Damascene sheep buyers every spring, but they are not camel owners. At this estimate the herds of the tribes, who are the principal breeders^' come to 720,000 head, and beyond this figure margin must be allowed for the tribes who breed in small numbers, and contribute irregularly to the Syrian marketsCHA-CHA 459 These figures can be checked by a calculation based on the number of camels, which come annually into the market. It must be borne in mind that the Bedouin sell only their surplus During the spring and early summer, nomad, Arabia lives principally on the milk of the camel, and it has no other means of transport. Moreover, the best riding camels, the Dhululs, are always females, and are not allowed to breed.

Rashd were to sell Shammar camels to the Ottoman Government II,-, Shalain, the paramount Sheykh o£ the Great Euwalla Confederation, would probably hold them up, as they crossed the Hamad, and there is no other road by which thev could be brought into Syria. An attempt to take camels in large numbers via Div^r- bekr or even up the Euphrates and so direct to Aleppo, would not meet with saoSs. The journey is too long, and the difficulty of feeding the camels on the way too great. Pasturage is always scanty along frequented roads. The Ruwalla, who are the clmel- TWlfr! 'i Syrian frontier, have shown great unwillingness to sell to the Turks, and m common with other tribes bordering on Syria, their chief amnVfv the outbreak of war between Turkey and Great Britain seems to have been test their camels should be commandeered for military purposes.

On the left bank of the Tigris, some nearly 33 miles by river below Baghdad, stand the ruins of the Sassanian winter capital, Ctesiphon. The origin of the name is obscure ; to the Arabs Ctesiphon, together with the Greek town of Selucia on the opposite bank, were known collectively as Madain, the Cities. Of Ctesiphon, the successor and heir to Selucia, nothing remains but a fragment of the palace of the Sassanian kings, Taq-i- Kisra, the arch of Chosroes. The huge vault of the throne-room, to which the ruin owes its name, has suffered considerably since it was first photographed byDieulafoy, but is still a landmark to the country side. The vault was built without centering and spans 25*80 metres. The facade of the south wing shows an exceedingly interesting decora tion of columns and blind arcades, a combination of Greek and Oriental architectural methods. The north wing has fallen comparatively recently. The building belongs in all probability to the fourth century. Ctesiphon was famed in history as a battlefield before our day ; it was here that the Mohammadan invaders finally defeated and over threw the Sassanians in 363, driving into exile the last of the Chosroes. About two miles to the north is the much venerated shrine of Salman Pak (the name is a corruption of Salman Farsi, Salman the Persian) who was one of the best known of the companions of the Prophet. Salman Pak is the centre of a Nahiyah of the same name in the'AzTziyah Qadha of the Sanjaq of Baghdad, and it is also the name now applied by the Turks to one of the most important battles fought between them and ourselves in the Great World War.DA'A—DAB D DA'AFAS— See Dhafrah.

BAHAMIYAH (Qal'at Ibn Farman)— A riverain tract on the left bank of the Tigris {q.v.), immediately Jbelow 'Amarah BAHANAH— A belt of sandy desert which issues from the north-eastern edge of the great Nafud in northern Central Arabia, and after running in a generally south-eastern direction eventually loses itself in the Ruba'-al-Khali. It must be borne in mind that the terms Dahanah and Nafud are to some extent interchangeable, the same tracts of desert being called the one or the other accroding to the explorer. The actual point of depar ture from the Nafud is west of the Linah wells where the Dahanah has a breadth of from 12 to 15 miles. From here it runs almost due east and west, with sand waves 300 yards apart and 50 feet deep. The sand is heavy and soft, and difficult to move in. After passing Linah the Dahanah trends southward, and is intersected by the Batin just south of Thamami. From here it begins to widen out, and where it is crossed by the Kuwait-Zilfi route, via the wells of As-Saiah, it is perhaps 40 miles wide. Between Wabrah and Rumhlyah, on the Kuwait-Riyadh route, it consists of seven great sand ridges, with smaller intermediate ones, separated from one another by plains; the ridges vary from a quarter of a mile to several miles in width, and the plains from about one and-a-half to seven miles. The sand of this part has a light-red or reddish-orange tint; the subsoil where exposed consists of light clay, pebbles, and sand-stone debris. There is vegetation, and the fauna include gazelle, hare, bustard, snakes, lizards, and beetles. Along this route the Dahanah takes two caravan days to traverse. The southern Dahanah has a more confused configuration than the northern, cones and and domes of many shapes being interspersed amongst the sand waves. The most direct route between Al-Hasa and Riyadh crosses the Dahanah a day's journey west of 'Urmah, where it has a breadth of 30 miles. Here the sand waves run east and west and are less deep and regular than in the north; moreover the sand itself is shallower though of a deeper colour. In crossing the Dahanah between Abu Jifan and Judah steep ascents are at first encountered alternating with nearly perpendicular descents down which camels slide bodily ; these are followed by an interval of firmer sand with scattered brushwood; near the centre of the tract patches of soil with dark coloured stones begin to appear through the sand ; beyond the centre the sandhills pass from the form of eminences and hollows to that of long rollers and then to that of steps ; finally progress ceases to be heavy and the country is sprinkled with vegetation.* In this part the Dahanah is separated from Summan by a well-defined valley. The nomads of Dahanah, as of Summan, are almost entirely Mutair. After being crossed by the route between Riyadh and Al-Hasa the Dahanah assumes a more southerly direction, and passing to the west of the Jabrln oasis finally loses itself in the Ruba'-al-Khali.— {Leachman; Gazetteer of ttie Persian Gulf.) •This phrase (from the p. G. G.) seems to infer that there is no veSetation in the Dahanah in these parts but is this correct ? C, C. R.

Among these are the majority of the Indian traders on the coast of Trucial 'Oman, who come here to recover debts and make purchases of pearls. Several pearl banks exist in the vicinity, among which are ;—Umm-as-Sulsul and Man- yokh, 8 and 5 miles respectively to the north ; Hawad Bin-Musammih, 9 miles to the south-east; Abu Dastur 4 miles to the south-west; and, besides several others which are nearer, Halat Dalmah 27 miles to the north-west. Dalmah belongs to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) The soundings are irregular in the vicinity. Anchorage may be found on the south eastern side in 10 fathoms, about 1 mile off the low, sandy plain, affording good shelter in a shantdl. Native boats lie on the western side, off the village, where they are sheltered from a shamal by the south-western point of the island, and are safe if a nashi comes on.— {Persian Gulf Pilot, 2914.)\ DAL—DAM 475 BALM AH (H alat)— A pearl-bank in the Persian Gulf about 27 miles north-west from the island of Dalmah (q.V.). DALWAH— See Hasa (Al) (Oasis). DAM or ILDAM— The administrative capital and principal town of the district of Widyan Dawasir in southern Najd ; it appears to be situated about midway between the eastern and western ends of that part of the district which is known as Wadi Dawasir. Site and buildings,—The town is surrounded by a wall in which there are four gateways: internally it is divided into two wards,' Ayaidhat and Shawaiq, to each of which a bazaar or Suq of the same name is attached. 'Ayaidhat is apparently on the west side of the town and Shawaiq on the east, while Suq-ash-Shawaiq is almost in the centre. The two bazaars, which are open squares, are connected by a street that widens out between them to form the meat market, known as Maqsab. On the east side of the town near one of the gateways is the combined fort and residence of the Amir, called Qasr-al-Hasaiyin which has several high towers. There are four large mosques, two in the Ayaidhat quarter and one at each end of the Suq-ash-Shawaiq ; but, as is usual in this part of Arabia, they are without decoration or architectural features. The ordinary houses of the town are frequently of brick and mortar and rise to an upper storey; sometimes they are whitewashed, and sometimes the lower part of the walls is painted green or red. The fa9ades of the upper storeys are often ornamented with a balcony projecting considerably over the entrance door. The people are Dawasir of the Rijban division and number perhaps 5,000 souls. They are described as independent in politics, bold in war, and enterprising in trade ; they are reported to be well armed with rifles, and Dam merchants are said to make journeys to both India and Africa in the ordinary course of business. In religion the inhabitants of Dam are Wahhabis or Hanbali Sunnis ; the mosques of the town are not many, apparently on account of a local preference for large over numerous congre- gations : There are about five much frequented schools, of which the Madrasat-bin- Dharman is the best known, and about 15 smaller ones. Female education is unknown here except in the family of the Amir and the houses of religious teachers. Agricultural and oilier resources, —The date groves are very extensive and contain an enormous numbers of palms. Other fruits are grown in abundance, and there is some cultivation also of wheat, barley, maize and lucerne, but almost entirely as secondary crops among the palms in the date gardens. Wells are numerous both within the town and outside it; the ordinary depth is about five fathoms, and the water as a rule is only fairly good ; inside the walls however there are some excellent wells, notably those of Atainah, Hamaili, Jalib and Mathlah. A large number of camels are owned here and a considerable number of horses ; but cattle are scarce and donkeys very few. Trade and industries. Imported goods, except arms and ammunition which are brought from Qatar through Afiaj, are received by way of Yaman and Hijaz. Merchants from Yaman and Najran are said to visit Dam but maintain no permanent business agencies there. Among the crafts exercised in the town are those of goldsmith, black smith, tinsmith, carpenter, potter, tailor and oil-presser. The number of shops in the bazaar is said to be very large, but the statistics obtained are not reliable. Swords and daggers of fine temper are made, but the daggers are not equal to those of Hadhramaut. Dam appears to be a rifle repairing and cartridge loading centre for a large tract of country, including Wadi Sabai' as well as the whole of Widyan Dawasir. It is reported that an attempt was lately made by som 3 mechanics, who had gained experience abroad, to start a rifle factory; but it proved impossible to turn out weapons which could compete either in quality or in price with those imported from Europe. Administration. —Dam is the seat of an Amir whose power is absolute in the town and extends m a modified degree to all the villages of Wadi Dawasir and Salaiyil. His political position is described in the article on Widyan Dawasir. The quarters of Ayaidhat and Shawaiq have each a Shaikh of their own ; both of these Shaikhs are of course m strict subordination to the Amir.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Oulf.) 3 p2 r476 DAM—DAM BAM (FARiQ-AD)— See Budaiya'.

The entrance is about a cable wide, between fringing reefs steep-to ; it is open to the south-westward, with about 30 fathoms of water in mid- channel. Within the entrance the harbour is about 5 cables in extent, and 1 cable wide between the 5-fathom lines. The anchorage in from 9 to 13 fathoms with good holding ground of soft sand and coral, is secure and well-sheltered, the western side of the harbour being landlocked. In the north-west corner the deep water extends to within 50 yards of the beach ; but both on the north-eastern and south-western sides, shallow water extends some distance off ; and in the centre of the harbour facing the entrance, are some shallow coral patches. With the exception of a few bushes there is no vegetation, nor •any signs of habitation ; nor is there any water. Damaghah, the nearest village, is 6 miles distant. When visited about the year 1833 it contained some 40 people who were ■unwilling to part with provisions of any kind. When Burton visited Damaghah in July, 1853, it was, according to his account, a wretched place inhabited by a few Juhainah, or Hataim, who sold wood to travellers. It was nevertheless a port of call for small craft carrying poor pilgrims.— {Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot, 1909; Burton, 1853,) DAMAGHAH (Village)— See Damaghah (Sharm).

The town consists of about 90 mud houses, withDAM—DAQ 477 a population of about 400 souls, and there is a large burial ground there. There la a small export trade carried on in ghi, hides, and gums, and the inhabitants possess many small boats which are chiefly used for shark fishing during the fine season. A reef of rocks, on which the sea breaks , extends li cables from the shore ; on the eastern side of this reef there is a good landing when the south-westerly swell is not too heavy, though at the same time the western side may be almost unapproachable.

DARRAj (Al Bu) ( Tribe)— A Shi 'ah tribe inhabiting lands on the right bank of the Tigris bounded on the north by the Dujailah canal, 6 miles above Kumait and extending downstream to the Butairah canal, 10 miles upstream of 'Amarah. At the time of the British occupation of 'Amarah the Shaikh was Muhammad-al- Hittab, who came in to the British, but subsequently in July 1915 went over again to the Turks. A relation named Mut shar ibn Faisal was put in as Shaikh and has since proved staunch. Mutashar lives in a fort 3 miles from the river and 4 miles from Kumait on the Mudalil canal. The tribesmen are of a somewhat turbulent nature. Their armed men number about 200 mounted men and 1,500 footmen. The territory of the Al Bu Darraj extends inland a considerable distance towards the Shatt-al-Hai. Crops. —Rice, m llet, wheat and barley. A second leading Shaikh of the Al Bu Darraj is Shia ibn Fahad, who is a junior partner with Mutashar. A third was Sahar ibn Husain, but in June 1916 Shahar's share of the estates was taken away and given to Mutashar owing to the former's perpetual intrigues with the Turks and against Mutashar. The Al Bu Darraj are a very unruly lot and Mutashar has little real influence with his tribesmen in the inland districts, which are in close proximity to Turkish influence on the Hai. They claim descent from the Bani Qahtan Arabs, the parent stock of all South Arabian tribes. Al Fartus.' —Said to be descended from the Bani Asad round Chabaish, but the latter deny the claim. They are now split up into many sections and with few exceptions are cultivators with (and at present subservient to) Majid al Khalifah of the Al Bu Muhammad. They own a large number of buffaloes. The question of taxation has always been a bone of contention between the Azairij and Majid al Khalifah, as during a certain period of the year the Fartus cross for grazing purposes into territory claimed by the Azairij. Prev ously many of the Fartus were cultivators with the Azairij and a few odd families are still with Shaikh Shiwai. In August 1916 a section of the Fartus made a raid on a few British bellums on the DARJA-AN-NISHFI— A pass or gorge, in the Aden Protectorate. Tigris. The principal sections are ;— Al Abahi. Al Attas .. , Al' Asaj rah Al Bu Burish .. Bait al Fahrawi. Bait al Lunaisi. Ras Al Bu, Shaikh Rukn ibn Musa. Suhaiyid ibn Sanad. Kumaiyish ibn Ghailan. Shaikh Faris ibn Tahir.

C52(w)GSBm DAR—MR The Abahi, Asajrah, Burish, Fahrawi, Lunaisi, Ras and Suwailmat are known as A1 Hathrah and are controlled by Faris-ibn-Tahir, the most important of the Fartus Shaiks, The 'Attas and the Ziyarah are under the control of Rukn ibn Musa and Mukallaf ibn Shukair. It has been arranged with the Azairij and Majid that the Fartus should occupy Ja'far as Saghir, a small island on the eastern fringe of the marsh opposite Ja'far al Kabir, and 1 for grazing purposes should go south-west of Saighal in the Chabaish direction. They have recognised settlements in Majid's territory at 'Adl and 'Aqr. Faris lives mostly on Ja'far as Saghir in Majid's territory, and Majid is responsible also for Mukallaf. One small section of the tribe live on the Tigris immediately south-west of Ezra's Tomb. The Fartus number probably 2,500 men (rifles) but are not united.

The southern portion is about IJ miles from Matrah by a tolerable track ; the northern portion is situated on the beach of Darsait Bay and is 2[ miles from Matrah. From here one can row round to Matrah in forty minutes. In normal times the population of the southern portion is about 50, and of the northern,- 80 souls, but from June to August both parts of the village are i practically deserted, the inhabitants being away date-picking. The southern portion consists of 7 huts with mud walls and 23 of palm leaves ; the northern portion, of 3 with mud walls and 60 or 70 of palm leaves. The water-supply is from wells as follows No. 1 ; 25 feet deep ; water 4 feet deep and drinkable. No. 2 ; 30 feet deep ; water 10 feet deep and drinkable. About | an acre of cultivation round this well. No. 3 ; 20 feet deep; not in use at present; water stagnant. No. 4 ; 30 feet deep ; chief well of the village, all the drinking water being obtained from it. No. 5; 22 feet deep; very large well with ample water of good quality. Wells 4 and 5 stand in cultivated patches 250 yards long by 80 yards broad. No. 6 ; suitable for washing purposes only; about ^ an acre of cultivation round it. No. 7 ; 25 feet deep ; large supply of drinkable water. No. 8 ; 20 feet deep ; supply ample, suitable for watering 10 animals at a tfme; f of an acre of cultivation. All the wells are bricked, and most of them have tanks adjoining where animals could be watered if the ground level were raised about a foot. There is room for about 8 to 10 horses at a time. Cultivation consists chiefly of iuceme and a sort of guinea-grass which are grown amongst the date palms. There are no shops or supplies in Darsait, everything being brought from Matrah, There is a large quantity of brushwood on the slopes of the hills west of the valley. Livestock comprises about 20 cows and bullocks, of which the latter work at wells; 20 goats and 10 donkeys. There are usually about 20 camels. Poultry fairly plen tiful.— {Murphy.) BARU'— Singular Dara'i. A tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate belonging to the Ghafiri faptiofl: originally they were all nomads of the Ruba '-al-Khalf, but some are now settled at Tana am and other places in Dhahirah. Estimates of their numbers differ very widely ; those in Dhahirah may amount to 3,000 souls of whom about one-third are settled. There are also a few at Barkah in Batinah. The Bedouin portion now frequent the neighbourhood of Jabal Hamrah. They are a wild and predatory race and hardly a rising of the eastern tribes occur in which the Daru' are not involved. The Bedouin portion are said to belong to the Ibadhi, the settled portion to the Sunni sect. The Be oum Daru rear large numbers of camels which they graze on the confines of the Great Desert.

It is 1^ miles long north and south, nearly a mile broad, with hills 312 feet high, and of regular outline, in the northern half. The southern portion is low. There is very little fringe reef, but within three miles south-eastward and south-west ward from the island, there are patches of 4 fathoms and less. There is no fresh water in the island. The following pearl-banks are situated in the vicinity of Das :—Riqqat Das, 2 miles to the south-east; Riqqat Mam', 9 miles to the south-east; Umm-al- Bunduq, 6 miles to the south-west; and Abul Qamaqim, Kharaiyis, and Abui Hanainun, at 7 and 5 miles, and a very short distance respectively, to the north west. Das Island is considered to belong to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and therefore to be included in Trucial 'Oman. Anchorage can be obtained about | a mile eastward of the south-eastern low, sandy point, in from 5 to 8 fathoms, but much swell would porbably be felt in a shamdl as the island affords but little shelter.

Topography and inhabitants. —There are no fixed villages in Dawairij : Tafrah, the administrative headquarters, is merely a mud fort; it is reported to be situated about 30 miles to the east and somewhat to the north of Amarah town. The district is traversed by a brackish stream of the same name (Dawairij) which comes down from the Persian hills and contributes to form the marshes between 'Amarah and Hawizeh. Dawairij is the headquarters of the Bani Lam tribe and their principal Shaikh has his residence in the district. Population. —The entire fixed population is estimated at 50,000 souls who, with the exception of a few Sunni officials, are all Shi'ah Arabs. Resources. —Under Turkish rule, the Dairat-as-Saniyah acquired some of the best land in the district and there are now flourishing date plantations at Tafrah which owe their existence to that department; the arable land under its management is generally leased to tribesmen of the neighbourhood for cultivation. Rice, maize and wheat are grown ; camels, cattle and sheep are abundant; and there are some buffaloes. The excellent grazing in the neighbourhood was in the past a cause of dispute not only between different sections of the Bani Lam, but also between the Turkish and Persian Governments.

DAWASIR ( district and islands)— j -A. district extending for a considerable distance along the right bank of the Shatt-al- 'Arab between Saihan and Dorah; its upper extremity is about 16 miles by river below the mouth of the Karun, while its lower is 15 miles by river above the Fao telegraph station: its own length between the two is nearly 19 miles. In the whole district there are about 50 hamlets of 5 to 15 huts each, inhabited by various tribes ; the people are somewhat nomadic in their habits and many old deserted huts are to be seen. One place, known as Kut-al-Khalifah, is inhabited by Muntafik. Palms are comparatively scarce and the crop poor, but native sailing boats call to collect inferior dates for exportation. The island of Ziyadiyah lies between the Shatt-al-'Arab and Dawasir in the uppermost 6 miles of its extent; and, where it terminates, a chain of low and narrow islands called Dawasir begins on the opposite or Persian side of the river and continues for about 6 miles. Exclusive of the part, apparently uninhabited, opposite Ziyadiyah island, Dawasir consists of the following tracts in order as the river is descended :— Name. Extent upon the river. . Inhabitants. R emarks. Dawaib 3 miles * About 1,250 souls of mixed tribes. Resources are estimated at 10,000 palms, 100 cattle, 250 sheep and goats and 6 camels. Saniyah 4 to 5 miles About 450 souls of vari ous tribes. There are about 3,000 date palms. Animals are 50 sheep and goats and 12 horses. This tract owes its name to the circumstance that it is the property of the Sultan of Turkey and is managed by the Dairat-as- Saniyah. Faddaghiyah Ditto 1,000'souls of Muhaisin of the Bait Kana'an section. The date palms of this tract are estimated at 5,000, and the livestock at 100 cattle, 150 sheep and goats and 100 horses. A creek which forms the upper boundary of this tract, dividing it from Saniyah, is known as the Faddaghiyah creek and has at times been notorious as a resort of river pirates. o r7ru? m ^i^] 6 ^ wou ^ appear that the total fixed population of Dawasir is about 2,700, and that date palms number some 18,000.—(Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) DAWASIR ( T ribe)— Singular Dosiri. An important Arab tribe of southern Najd, having settlements also on the coasts of the Persian Gulf, {Note. —Palgrave says the true name of these people is A1 'Ammar; but see below.) Distrihutiori. The districts par excellence of the Dawasir are those of Widyan Dawasir and Aflaj m Central Arabia the Bedouins aa well aa the settled inhabitanta of thoseDAWlSIE 487 regions are chiefly of this tribe. The numerous villages of the Salaiyil and Wadi Dawasir divisions of the Widyan Dawasir district belong entirely to the settled Dawasir, whose fellow tribesmen in Aflaj are owners of Badi', Haddar, Hamar, Kharfah, Lailah, Marwan, Rajaijiyah, Raudhah, Shutbah, Wasit and Wusailah. The populations of Hautah town and Hilwah in the Hautah district and of Hariq town in the Hariq district are partly Dawasir, and the tribe is represented in Kharj both by settled villagers at Dilam, Sulai- miyah and Yamamah and by Bedouins who encamp in the district. In 'Aridh, where nomadic Dawasir also are seen, fixed Dawasir occur at Bir, Dqalah, Hasi, Jarinah, Mal- ham, Safurrah and Thadiq in Mahmal; at 'Ammariyah, Dara'iyah, and Manfuhah on Wadi Hanifah ; and at Dhrumah town and Mizahmiyah in the Dhrumah tract: in Sadair they are found at 'Audah, Ghat, Hasun, Jalajil, Ma'ashibah, Raudhah, Ruwaidhah, and Zilfi, and in Washam at Marat. The settlements of the Dawasir scarcely extend further north than Sadair, and in Qasim their presence is reported at Hatan, Huwailan, Quwai'ah and Shamaslyah only. On the south-west their limit appears to be in the Wadi Sabai' district, where some exist at Hazam, Khurmah, Raudhah, Rumadan and Suwaiyid. In Bahrain the Dawasir are the most numerous Sunni tribe after the 2 Utub, and are the second of all the Bahrain tribes in political importance, being inferior in this respect to the 'Utub only. The Dawasir of Bahrain are said to have immigrated from Najd, whence they gradually moved eastwards and, after spending several years by the way on Zakh- nuniyah island, finally arrived in Bahrain about 1845 under the leadership of the grand father of their present Shaikh. They have now about 800 houses at Budaiya' and 200 at Zallaq, both places on the west side of Bahrain Island. About 300 households of the tribe are settled at Dohah in Qatar and perhaps the same number in the town of Kuwait. Offshoots from the Bahrain community of Dawasir exist in the Persian coast district of Dashtistan at Chah Kutah and its dependent villages and at the village of Jazireh in Bushehr harbour. Divisions.—-ThQ principal divisions of the Dawasir tribe are said to be : 1. Braik (Al). 5. Riyayithat. 2. Hasan (Al). 6. Suhabah, 3. Makharib. an( j 4. Rijban. 7. Wida'in. Some of these call for further remark or for minuter classification. 1. The Al Braik are possibly not a main division of the Dawasir; according to one account they are included in a larger unit known as the Misa'irah, to which sections Al Abul Hasan, Al Bu Sabba' and a group of sections known as Musarir also belong. Al Braik are found at Nuwaimah, Al Abul Hasan at Quwaiz, and Al Bu Sabba' at Nazwah, all places m Widyan Dawasir. Mu'addi-bin-Iqwaid, at present the chief Shaikh of the Bedouin Dawasir of Central Arabia, himself belongs to the Misa'irah. The Hanabijah of Bilad-al-Hanabijah in Wadi Dawasir are Misa'irah ; so also are the Intaifat at Haddar in Aflaj, the Al Rishdan at Ruwaisah in Wadi Dawasir, the Sharafah at Sabhah and Thamamiyah in Wadi Dawasir, the 'Uwaidhat at Thamamiyah in Wadi Dawasir and the 'Uwaimir at Huwaizah in Wadi Dawasir. Some of the Dawasir in Zilfi also are Misa'irah. 2. The Al Hasan division consists of two sub-divisions, the 'Ammar and the Farjan, which in turn are composed of the sections given in the table below. Numerically small sections are distinguished by an asterisk, and in a few cases localities in which the sections are known to be represented are specified.

The Walamin have two sub sections known as Mana' and Sa'ad. Character and life. —Little is known, in consequence of the remoteness of their country and its inaccessibility to European travellers, of the main body of the Dawasir; but they appear to be of consequence as a settled rather than as a nomad tribe. Palgrave considers them to be the most contemptible of all the Arab race. According to Leachman, they are a narrow-minded, fanatical, and lying people, disliked equally by townsfolk and Bedouins. They possess many of the Wahhabi characteristics ; and Leachman was informed that a woman will not look with favour on a man of the Dawasir tribe until he has killed seven men. A section of the Dawasir live in the neighbourhood of Al-Hasa and raid along the routes to Riyadh. They also visit the Jabrin oasis. A party of the Dawasir tribe from the far interior, who supplied at Kuwait in 1905 most of the information about tribal divisions given above, wore a somewhat distinctive dress in which differet shades of red and brown were blended, and they carried silver-mounted swords. Their kerchiefs and shawls were red, of European manufacture; their mantles were brown, some light, some dark in colour; their swords, they said, were from India, Baghdad and Makkah. In their Bahrain settlements none of the tribe are pastoral; there they are chiefly engaged in pearl diving, in pearl dealing and in the culture of dates. The Dawasir of Central Arabia profess to be follwers of Ibn Hanbal, but in reality they are Wahhabis in the modern acceptation of the term ; in Bahrain they are Maliki Sunnis ; and in Dashtistan about one-fourth are still Sunnis, while the remainder have recently been converted to Shi'ism. Political 'position. —The district of Widyan Dawasir forms a principality which is almost purely D5siri in population, is ruled by a Dosiri chief with his capital at Dam, and is but slightly attached to the Wahhabi state; Aflaj, on the other hand, though all but exclusively a D5siri district, appears to be an integral part of the dominions of Ibn Sa'ud. The political organisation of Widyan Dawasir is noticed more fully in the article on that district. In the other districts of Najd where Dawasir occur they are not of political importance in a tribal sense. The Dawasir of Bahrain are a practically independent community; they pay no revenue to the Shaikh of Bahrain on account either of their pearl boats or their date gardens, and under the weak regime of the present ruler they would certainly resist any attempt by him at interference in their affairs.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf ; Leachman ; Palgrave.) Another authority describes the Dwasir tribe as follows :— The nomadic Dawasir are Wahabite and are under Ibn Sa'ud. Half-settled, they have villages in the Wadi Dwasir, which they inhabit during the summer. They breed camels though not in such large quantities as the Qahtan. The Qasim dealers do not come as far south as the Dawasir, but the latter bring their camels into Al Hasa and dispose of them there to the Qusman. The Dawasir have overflowed into the easterly provinces of southern Najd, and now form a considerable settled element in Aflaj, where they are the chief owners of land, worked by men of thefallah tribe of Bani Khadir. To a less extent they are found also inHaria and Aridh, where the contribute a proportion of the village and even the town population. Small parties of their nomads wander between Najd and Hsa and trouble the routes. A considerable body is settled in Bahrain. Indeed so small a proportion of the Dawasir is in any sense Bedawi, .that the tribe hardly comes within our purview here, and it is not worth while to enumerate its imperfectly known sub-sections. A third authority give the following additional sub-tribes of the Dawasir I 1 N abit. Al Farhan. Al Jaraiyis. Al Nashaiyir. Al Katafin. Al Khadhaiyir. Al Muraiya'. Al Rashid. _ n/ Al Wazanin.

It has a large two- storeyed stone station building, covered goods station, with a platform 50 yards long for loading trucks, and a small yard leading on the Haifa-Dera'a road. Approaches easy, with good metalled road to village, which is situated on the far side of a deepish ravine, one mile to the south-west, and contains 400 houses. The station also contains 4 miles of siding and 2 dead ends, about 1,800 yards in all, two water tanks each with a capacity of 5,600 gallons, supplied from a good well by means of a steam pump, engine sheds and repairing shops. Also a coal loading platform with a small reserve of 20 tons of coal. Part of the corn trade of Hauran comes through this place, and it also boasts of a good stone restaurant near the station, kept by a Qre^k.^MaunseU: Murphy. 1911.)

BHA'AIKAH— y A patch of desert in south-western Najd, in the neighbourhood of Jabal Sija, near which the Hajj routes from Qasim and 'Aridh join. Doughty describes Adh-Dha'aikah as a circuit of desert in the way between Al Qasim and Mecca, plain without bergs, of mixed earth, and good pasture, with an altitude of 4,100 feet. Like the adjacent desert called Shiffa, it is considered by some to form part of the larger tract of Hazam-ar-Raji.

Boundaries and divisions. —Upon the coast Abu Dhabireaches from Khor-al-Ghanadhah, which divides it from the Shaikhdom of Dibai, on the east to Khor-al-'Odaid on the west—a distance of over 200 miles. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the bay of Umm-al-Hul near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India: Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his state in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that his jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined ; it is asserted that on the east they reach to the Baraimi Oasis, but without taking it in ; and on the south they may pre sumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba'-al-Khali. The principal divisions of Abu Dhabi upon the mainland in order from west to east are 'Aqal, Mijan, Sabakhat Matti Dhafrah, (including Bainunah, Liwah and other minor tracts), possibly Khatam, and finally what may be called the home district in which the capital, Abu Dhabi town, is situated : these tracts, except the last, all form the subjects of separate articles. The insular possessions of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi are the islands of Arzanah, Daiyinah, Dalmah, Das, Qarnain, Salali, Yas and Zirko and, these also being described elsewhere under their own names, it only remains to deal here with the geography of the home division. Physical characteristics and topography of the home division. —This part of the princi pality apparently consists altogether of undulating sandy desert with scanty grazing and a poor water-supply. The following are the inhabited places and other points in it of which the names are most frequently heard :— Name. Position. Nature. Remarks. Batin .. On the northern shore of Khor-al- Batin, about 1| miles within the entrance. A village of 130 date branch huts, of which 100 belong to the Al Bu Mahair and the remainder to the Sudan tribe.

The Bedouins of the principality are the remainder of the Bani Yas and nearly the whole of the Manasir tribe, or together about 3,300 persons. It is probable that the498 DHABI fort of the Shaikh at a little distance inland behind the town; not far from it, on tlie outskirts of the town proper, is the separate bazaar of the Indian traders. The anchor age* for large vessels is totally unsheltered and lies more than two miles off the shore. At the back of the town are some stunted date trees and water is obtained from wells 5 35 years ago most of the drinking water of the place used to be fetched from Dibai, but recently potable water has become obtainable in the vicinity of the town, especially at a place 3 or 4 miles from it; pits are dug in which the water collects at 4 to 6 feet below the ground level. Immediately to the south of the town is the large shallot lagoon of Khor-al-Batin, and to the east a creek connected with it, both of which are described in the article on the Abu Dhabi Principality, The population of the town may be about 6,000 souls, about J Bani Yas and the rest other tribes. The Bani Yas sections are A1 Bu Falah, 40 persons; Qubaisat, 380 j Maharibah, 300; A1 Bu Falasah, 200; Qumzan, 250; A1 Bu Hamir, 300 j Rumaithat, 500 J Mazarl, 300; and Hawamil, 500. The other tribes are Al Bu Mahair, 500; Sudan^ 375 ; Marar, 200 ; Thamairat, 120 ; Al Bin Nasir, 120 ; Al Bu 'Amim, 120 ; Khamarah (said to be originally from Khamirin Persia), 375 ; Halalamah, 75 ,* Dahailafc, 200; and Baharinah, 120. To these must be added a Persian community of about 500 persons and 65 Hindus. The inhabitants of Abu Dhabi live almost entirely by pearl diving and fishing or in a few cases by petty trade ; they have no ordinary cultivation and Very few dates. Par ticulars of shipping are given in the article on Abu Dhabi Principality, About 750 camels belong to the place, and there are 85 horses ; but of the horses all except 5 belong to the Shaikh and his family. Trade with the interior is insignificant, being only with the Baraimi Oasis and with the Bani Yas and Manaslr tribes. There are over 70 shops of all sorts in the Abu Dhabi bazaar ; 40 are kept by Persians, 19 by Hindus and 10 by Arabs. Pearls are the sole export. The Hindus import cloth, rice, coffee and sugar besides dealing in pearls. British interests are represented here by the Hindu trading community, all from Tattal in Sind, the majority have their families with them, and most of them take leave to India at intervals of about a year. In the pearl season the number of Hindus is about doubled. No Muhammadan Indians do business at this place.— {Gazetteer of the Per sian Gulf.) Abu Dhabi (Latitude 24° 29' N., Longitude 54° 21' E.), standing at the western extreme of the country of 'Oman, is the principal town of the great Bani Yas tribe, and is under an independent Shaikh, who claims the sovereignty over the coast westward to Khor al-'Odaid. His authority is nominally recognised also by the Bedou in of these parts. The Bani Yas are a fine lot of men, and the Shaikh is very friendly to the British. They wear their hair long over the shoulders, twisted up in plaits. Abu Dhabi was formerly the chief centre of piracy in these waters. The fort is small, with six towers close together, on one of which is the flagstaff. A small tower stands on the beach where there are also several conspicuous stone build ings, one of which is on the low north-western sandy point of the town ; the rest of the town, extending nearly 2 miles along the shore, is date mat huts. It has about 20,000 inhabitants, with some Banyans amongst them, and it sends 600 boats to the pear, fishery. After the pearl season the fishing boats are to be found at every island, creek &amp;c., between Abu Dhabi and Khor-al-'Odaid. There are a few stunted date trees, about a mile inland of the town. The Coast is very low white sand, the only landmarks being the fort and Jabal Fataisa, a low hill in an island in the backwater, 6 miles southward of the fort. This hill, frofl 1 seaward, first appears of a dark colour, but on approach the white sand of the I lower part becomes visible. Reef. —A reef, 1| cables broad, extends 3J cables west-south-westward from about 1J cables north-westward of the north-western sandy point of the town; it has from 3 feet to one fathom water and a bank, with from 1| to 3 fathoms water, extends Ij miles northward and north-westward. The channel between the reef and the shore has a least depth of 2 fathoms. Anchorage. —Large vessels anchor in from 4 to 5 fathoms water, with Abu Thabi fori' bearing 122° true, distant about 2 to 2J miles ; this position is open to seaward.ZCI DHA—DHA 499 i stone ^ r island Small vessels of 12 feet and less draught anchor in the channel between the reef and the shore, in about 2^ fathoms water, with the fort bearinng 174° true, cables off shore; this anchorage is quite sheltered by the reef. Tides. —It is high water, full and change, at Abu Dhabi, at about Xllh., springs riser &lt;5 feet to 8 feet, DirectioTis* —For Abu Dhabi from the northward make Sir Abu Nu air; bring and keep its peak bearing 356° true, and continue to steer 176° true after losing sight of th« island. The soundings are irregular, varying from about 16 to 7 fathoms, and there are great overfalls; the tidal streams which set, probably about one knot, north-east and south-east, must be considered. Keep a good lookout from aloft, as the fort is only visible from a distance of about 8 miles from deck, or when in 8 fathoms water, which depth is also found close to the reefs. The reefs north-eastward of Abu Dhabi must lye especially guarded against. Having made Abu Dhabi fort, bring it to bear 122° true and anchor as above directed. For the inner anchorage, to enter which the afternoon is the best time, approach with the fort (Latitude 24° 29 / N., Longitude •54'° 22' E,) bearing 122° true, and pass close Westward of the reef, which shows well; then turn eastward and northward close round the reef, and anchor as above directed. In approaching Abu Dhabi from the north-eastward, give a wide berth to Hadd at tThalei There is a passage northward from the anchorage which appears to have a depth of 2 fathoms • it is available for a sailing vessel leaving the anchorage with a westerly wind the vessel being conned from a loft by sight. This passage is used by native craft. Caution. —Attention must be paid to the lead when approaching the southern shore of the gulf, as the streams are strong and uncertain, the land very low with few or no distinctive features, and the survey is very incomplete. Supplies. —Cattle might possibly be obtained at Abu jphabi. The water here is very brackish, all good water being brought from Dibai, Pilots. —The best pilots for the coast between Dibai and A1 Bida can be obtained at Abu DhabL The Khor. —About 3 miles south-westward of Abu Thabi fort is the mouth of a chan nel leading into a large backwater, 3| miles wide in the entrance, and extending pos sibly 20 miles inland. The greater part is shallow, but there are many deep channels and several islands; it has not been sounded.

DHAFIR (T ribe)— DHAFlR— The Dhafir lie to the north of the Mutair along the Batin. Their dlrah stretches west nearly to the pilgrimage route, the Darb Zubaidah, but in summer they draw in to the Euphrates between Zubair and Samawah. Some of the sub-tribes such aa the Sa'iy and Dhir'an, camp habitually in the Muntafik country to the east of the river. Thed used to pay tribute to Ibn Rashid, but are now ceaselessly at feud with the Shammar. They raid the Toqah tribes as far north as Karbala, but chiefly they harry the Shammar m their spring pasturages east of the Nafud and hold up the Amir's caravans between Hail and Kajaf. With the diminishing authority of the Rashids their aggressions have multiplied, so that the old eastern caravan route, the Darb Zubaidah, has been almost abandoned. Every year Ibn Rashid leads punitive expeditions against them. In i the winter of 1915 he asked Hamud Ibn Suwait, the paramount Shaikh of the Dhafir, to join him in an expedition against Ibn Sa'ud and Kuwait, but Hamud refused, plead- i ing his weakness, the truth being that the hostility between the two is too bitter to admit of any co-operation. Hamud is now (1917) a man of about 42, intelligent, and reckoned amongst the Arabs a fairly good politician and tribal administrator. The Dhafir comprise about 2,500 tents. The tribe falls into two main divisions, the Butun and the Samid which are subdivided as follows :— Al-Butun. Shaikh Humud-ibn-Suwait; 1,500 men. ..

DHAFRAH— The westernmost and least known part of 'Oman, a sub-division of Trucial 'Oman. Bwmdriries—Dhafrah lies between the Persian Gulf on the north and the Ruba-al- Khali or Great Desert of Southern Arabia, on the south; on the west it is bounded by Sab&amp;khat Matti and Jafurah, and on the east by Khatam. Divisions. The huge area thus defined comprises at least five separate tracts which are distinguished by names, but the absence of striking natural features makes it difficult to determine their relative positions and extent. Indeed there is reason to think that the internal boundaries of Dhafrah are somewhat vague, and that the names of the tracts are not employed by all Bedouins in strictly the same sense. The five tracts in question are Taff, Dhafrah proper, Bainunah, Qufa and Liwah of which last name the correct form is said to be Al-Juwa; of these Liwah and Bainunah are the most important. All authorities agree that Liwah is the southernmost and furthest inland of the divi sions of Dhafrah; that its length, which is eastwards and westwards, approaches, if it does not exceed, 175 miles; that its breadth is insignificant in comparison with its length ; and that the village of Shah is situated in it almost exactly midway between its two extremities. To determine the position of Liwah it is therefore only necessary to determine the position of Shah, but here we are confronted by serious discre pancies of evidence; the most probable view, however, appears to be that Shah is situated 50 to 55 miles inland from the coast upon a line drawn due south from Ras Miqaishit, the western poiut of the Salali group of islands, and that it is about 90 miles south-west by south of Abu Dhabi town. If this opinion errs, it is probably by brines, ing Shah somewhat too near to the coast and too far to westwards. The position of Bainunah depends upon that of a well Da'afas, which undoubtedly of f? 1 ? 8 tract, though its position in the same is not, perhaps, so central as that of bhah in Liwah. Accodring to the report which for several reasons appears most reliable Da afas is about 30 miles south-east of Jabal Dhannah (on the coast opposite' Yas island) and about 20 miles inland from the nearest point on the sea. The alter native position attributed to Da'afas is very much more southerly and more easterly than that just described. It is not disputed that Bainunah is between Liwah and sea ? re T lleS t0 th6 westernmost extremity of Dhafrah, in other words to the border of babakhat Matti. Of the remaining tracts Qufa is undobutedly interposed between Liwah and Bainunah and is Jong from east to west and narrow from north to south. Taff is, by general consent, a maritime strip extending the whole length of Dhafrah with an average depth inland of about 15 miles. Its westernmost section, that reaching Bainfi 1 ^ 08 on e er s ^ e Jabal Dhannah, is possibly particularised as Taff The last tract requiring to be located is Dhafrah proper, and the name may be taken to signify so much of Dhafrah in the wider sense as is not included in any of the foregoing fnTu • V 08 * 10n 0 * Dhafrah proper with reference to Bainunah is doubt ful ; but it is probably on the east while Bainunah is on the west and the distances of the r502 DHAPRAH two fit)m the sea are similar. The wells of Kaifaifah, it may be added, seem to be new the point at which the tracts of Bainunah and Dhafrah proper meet one another and the tract of Taff; Following then the opinion which seems most worthy of acceptance we may provi» sionally arrange the divisions of Dhafrah as follows — 1. Along the coast a strip 15 miles wide, Which for nearly 100 miles On the east is called Taff) and for 60 miles on the west Taff Bainunah. 2. Behind the coastal strip a belt 40 miles wide composed of Dhafrah proper) Bai* ntinah and Qnfa : of these Dhafrah proper (30 miles broad) adjoins Taff throughout its length and Bainunah (20 miles broad) adjoins Taff Bainunah, also throughout its length, while Qufa fills the space remaining on the south of these two. 3. Inland of Qufa and like Qufa roughly parallel to the sea, another belt measuring about 175 miles in length and perhaps 20 miles in bredth: this belt isLiwah. Physical charucieristics. —The maritime tracts of Taff and Taff Bainunah contain no features of interest except a few small hills, which are possibly volcanic. The shore is stony, and at a little distance inland swamps are said to exist, interspersed with stony mounds* Vegetation is chiefly Abal and Hams. Dhafrah proper and Bainunah are said to resemble one another in character; they form apparently, a fairly level expanse of heavy red sand or reddish soil with occasional sand dunes of lighter colour and gravely patches. Dhafrah proper, at least, is somewhat higher in level than Taff. Neither tract possessses any trees ; but in Dhafrah proper there is some vegetation of arta and hadh, and in Bainunah the arta, markh and abal are found ; both districts afford a considrable amount of grazing for camels. The wells of Dhafrah proper seem to vary in depth between 1 and 2 fathoms and those of Bainunah between H and 7 fathoms, the average in the case of the latter tract being 3 fathoms. Qufa is an inhospitable region of sandy ridges with no vegetation except a few shrubs Of arta and very little water; but the few wells that occur are shallow, not exceeding 2 fathoms. Liwah is the most remarkable of all the tracts. It consists mainly of white undulat* ing sand dunes, altogether without vegetation ; but it contains over a score of small dep ressions, disposed in series or chains from east to west. These depressions are divided from one another by sandy wastes ; but at the bottom of each depression there is fertile soil, supporting the cultivation of a village which generally stands upon a sandy eminence near by. These low-lying oases contain plantations of date palms, which in a few cases are of considerable extent. The water level in Liwah, doubtless in the depressions, appears to be on the average at 2 fathoms beneath the surface ; and except at Tharwaniyah a depth of 4 fathoms is not, it would seem, ever exceeded. Throughout Dhafrah, to speak generally, the water of the wells is of fairly good quality and not very scarce. The wells themselves are either unlined or lined only w ith date sticks and leaves ; the only exceptions to the rule appear to be the Babah well in Bainu* nah, which is reported to be half lined with masonry and a well called Saqar, also in Bainunah but not precisely located, which is said to be entirely so lined. This pecu liarity is of doubt due largely to the shallowness of the wells, but it also seems to indicate firmness in the soil. Inhabitants. —In the whole of Dhafrah only two tribes are found, the Bani las and the Manasir ; the former are settled rather than nomadic, while the latter are alto gether Bedouins. Of Liwah they are jointly occupants, but the permanent villages called Mahdhar, all belong to the Bani Yas, the settlements of the Manasir being unte nanted except in summer while the date harvest is in progress. Among the Manasir date plantations are joint tribal property, but with the Bani Yas they belong to individiia owners. The Bani Yas of Dhafrah are semi-civilised; some of them trade with A u Dhabi and even Dibai and correspond with those places. The dwellings of both tribes are huts of date sticks and leaves ; the Manaslr^ when their sojourn in Liwah is ovei or the year, close theirs up and stop the adjacent wells, it is said, with sand. Dhafraii proper is the principal grazing ground of the Manasir while Bainunah contains t e favourite pastures of the Bani Yas ; but in winter the Manasir range as far west as Qa a and in summer their camels are left with those of the Bani Yas in Bainunah. The Bani \as of Dhafrah take a share in the pearl fishery and own a number of boats whic aie kept at Bandar Radaim, Khor Mughairah and Bandar Mirfah upon the coast. 9dhafrah 503 number of the Bani Yas ordinarily in Dhafrah may be reckoned at 5,100 souls, while that of the Manasir is the entire strength of the tribe or 1,400 persons ; and besides these there are about 70 Bedouin families of the Marar tribe who are accustomed to wander in Liwah. The whole population of Dhafrah may therefore be estimated at 6,500 souls but it is fluctuating.

Dhahirah thus forms an elongated paral*2-7Z LHAHIRAH 517 ithe^ ! characteristics. —Dhahirah consists of a plain of uneven surface sloping down from the hills of Hajar to the Ruba'-al Khali, in which the whole of its drainage is lost. It has two principal valleys, Wadi Dhank, which comes down from Hajar to the town of Dhank and thence runs to the Ruba'-al-Khali preserving throughout its course a general direction from east to west, and Wadi-al-Kablr which, descending from Hajar west-south- westward towards 'Ibri, becomes in the neighbourhood of that town Wadi Sanaisal and receives from the east Wadi Sharsah and Wadi-al-Ain, the former joining it a little above, and the latter a little below, 'Ibri. The hills which diversify the surface of Dhahirah are outliers of Hajar; chief among them are detached or semi-detached eminences around 'Ibri which attain an elevation of 300 or 400 feet above the plain, an isolated group of low hills called Jabal Falaij which lies some 25 miles to the north-west of 'Ibri, and some scattered hillocks between 'Ibri and Jabal Falaij on the side towards the Great Desert. The north-western slopes of Jabal-al-Kor may be regarded as pertaining to Dhahirah along with a ridge called Jabal Haddah which runs west-north-west from the southern extremity of Jabal-al-Kor and forms an acute angle with it. The elevation of the district varies from 1,200 feet above sea-level at 'Ibri to 2,750 feet at Miskin. To the west of Dhank town the plain is generally stony or shingly with a sparse growth of mimosa and acacia that affords winter grazing for thousands of Bedouin goats. South of Dhank town a more sandy and less stony region begins. The south-east corner of the district between Jabal-al-Kor and Jabal Haddah is a plain sprinkled with mimosa and debris from the hills. Scrub jungles cover the open plains through which Dhahirah merges alonglts entire length into the Ruba'-al-Khali. Every where water is derived from springs. Populations, —Full particulars of the settled inhabitants of Dhahirah will be found in the articles on the Wadis mentioned in the preceding paragraph, in those on the towns which they contain, and in the table of villages given at the end of this article. In this place it is sufficient to recall that 'Ibri is mainly a town of the Ya'aqib and Dhank of the Na'im, while considerable settlements of Bani' 'Ali, Bani Zid and Bidah occur in Wadi Dhank ; Bani Kalban are found in Wadi Dhank and Wadi al-Kabir ; Abriyin in Wadi Sanaisal; Bani Hina, Manadharah and Sawawifah in Wadi-al-'Ain ; and Maqabil in Wadi Sharsah. Towards the north-western end of the district there are communities of Bani Qitab, and Baliichis and other tribes are represented in various places in numbers not entitling them to special mention here. Regarding the nomadic inhabitants of Dhahirah less is known ; but they seem to be chiefly Na'im and 'Awamir in the north-west and Dam in the south : there are also Bani Zafait. The Bedouin element is in Dhahirah highly important but its numerical strength is not ascertainable. The following is an estimate of the settled population of Dhahirah : Wadi-al-'Ain Wadi Dhank Wadi-al-Kabir with its tributary Wadi Bilad Shahum Wadi Sanaisal • • •• •• •• Wadi Sharsah Remainder of the district (see the table at the end of this article) Total 3,000 7,300 8,000 6,400 1,400 5,000 31,100 souls. Agriculture, industries and trade.—The products of Dhahirah include all the typical products of the 'Oman Sultanate, and the wheat is reputed better than that of the other districts. ^ The soil, where cultivable, is described as a rather heavy clay mixed with stones. 'Ibri is the centre of the richest cultivation ; in its vicinity are produced wheat, millet, indigo, sugar and lucerne, besides dates, mangoes, limes and other fruits The chief industry is indigo-dyeing. Wheat and fruits are exported to the Sharqiyah and Sohar districts. Administration.—The hold of the Sultan of 'Oman on the Dhahirah district is slight. but he maintains a Wali, supported by a garrison of 20 men, at 'Araqi in Wadi Sanaisal!518 DHlHIRAH Topography.—The following is an alphabetical list of the principal places in Dhahirah exclusive of those, among which are the most important, that are described elsewhere in the articles on Wadis Kabir, Saniasal, Sharsah, 'Ain and Dhank Name.

BHAHRAN (B arr-adh-)— A littoral tract in the Hasa Sanjaq; though included within the boundaries of the larger tract known as Biyadh it is distinguished therefrom by its natural characteristics and by the possession of a separate name. Bahrain Island lies off the coast of Barr-adh- Bhahran at 15 to 25 miles distance. Boundaries. —Upon the coast Barr-adh-Dhahran extends from Dammam on the north- that is from the southernmost outpost of the Qatif Oasis—to the entrance of D5hat Ruhum on the south ; its length is thus rather less than 30 miles. Its depth inland is indeterminate, but does not exceed a few miles. Physical features. —The only striking accident of surface in Barr-adh-Dhahran is Jabal-adh-Dhahran, from which, it is said, the name of the entire tract is derived. This is a range running parallel to the shore between Dammam and Qal'at-al-Husain, which are 12 miles apart, at a distance of only 2 or 3 miles from the sea. The principal summit, flat-topped and 500 feet high, is situated 5 miles inland from the coast and 17 miles ap proximately south-south-east of Qatif town. About 3 miles nearer to Qatif town and 6 miles south of Dammam is a conical peak, belonging to the same range, which is 446 feet in height and bears the name of Jabal Mudrah. On the south side of Jabal-adh Dhahran is an area called Madarah containing many wells. The land on the eastern side of Jabal Dhahran, which slopes down to the sea, is actually higher upon the average than that on the western side. Barr-adh-Dhahran contains numerous small clumps of date trees scattered about in all directions.

A well, r s622 DHAID Larak island also is inhabited by about 200 souls of Dhahuriym who are closely connected with the people of Kumzar. In the cold weather the Dhahuriyin of Ruus-al-Jibal live by fishing; in spring they migrate bodily, leaving only caretakers behind, to Khor Fakkan, Dibah and Khasab where they attach themselves to some of the permanent residents and bivouac in the date plantations. The Dhahuriyin are practically a part of the Shihuh tribe, by whom they are surrounded and with whom they are closely identified, but they claim connection with the Dhawahir of Baraimi; the Dhawahir, however, it must be observed, are Mawalik and Hinawiyah, while the Dhahuriyin are mostly Hanabilah and Ghafiriyah, a circumstance which renders somewhat doubtful the validity of the claim. The Dhahuriym do not admit that they are in any way subordinate to the Shihuh ; they appear, except those of Maqa- qah, Qanah, Sham and Sibi, who have perhaps closer relations with the Bani Hadiyah, to be connected with the Bani Shatair section of that tribe. The Dhahuriym of Film and Mansal are Shafi'is in religion ; the rest of the tribe are Hanbalis.— {Gazetteer of (he Persian Gulf.) DHAID— An isolated village in the heart of the great 'Oman Promontory; it belongs to the principality of Sharjah and geographically and politically it is a centre of some import ance in Trucial 'Oman. Position, surroundings and climate. —Dhaidis about 30 miles east of Sharjah Town and 33 miles south by west of the town of Ras-al-Khaimah. It stands near the western side of a level plain, which is about 15 miles wide from west to east and the same in length from north to south ; this plain is bordered on the west and north by sand dunes, on the east by the hills which form the backbone of the 'Oman Promontory,, and on the south by the shingly plateau of Qallah Mahafidh. The main features of the Dhaid plain and some other localities adjoining it are described in the last paragraph of the present article. The plain of Dhaid is well wooded, containing many acacias^ and after rain it produces in abundance a coarse tussocky kind of grass. In the summer months a dry hot wind blows constantly at Dhaid, detracting from the amenity of the place which otherwise would be considerable. Village and inhabitants. —The village of Dhaid consists of about 140 houses, nearly all date-leaf huts ; of these about 70 belong to the Tanaij tribe, 40 to the Bani Qitab, and 30 to Na'im of the Khawatir section. The Tanaij and Na'im communities have each a fortified mud tower for the defence of their separate quarters ; and on the east side of the village is a four-towered fort belonging to the Shaikh of Sharjah. Dhaid is the head quarters of the nomad portion of the Tanaij, but the Bedouins who frequent the plain surrounding it are chiefly, perhaps, Bari Qitab, Agricultural resources. —The date groves of Dhaid form an oasis about 1 mile in dia meter. They are irrigated by a fine Falaj which comes from Wadi Haqalah to the south east and passes through the precincts of the Shaikh of Sharjah^s fort on its way to the oasis ; the stream before it is tapped for irrigation is about three feet wide and two feet deep, clear and transparent, and has a strong flow. The waters of the Falaj are carefully divided up among the lands of the oasis, and the local representative of the Shaikh of Sharjah is responsible for their correct distribution. In addition to dates a little wheat is grown at Dhaid, and the inhabitants have the usual complements of domestic animals. Administration. —The settlement is governed and kept in order by a Wali who is directly under the orders of the Shaikh of Sharjah. This official is, at the present time, a venerable old negro retainer of the Sharjah family, who resides in his master^s fort and flies that flag of Trucial 'Organ upon its north-western tower. The annual revenue derived by the Shaikh of Sharjah from Dhaid is said to consist of 100 Jirabs of dates, paid as a royalty, and of $228 in cash recovered as a water rate from users of the Falaj. The position of the Shaikh's fort is such as to dominate the Falaj ; but it is questionable whether the possessors of the fort could seriously interfere with the flow or affect the course of so strong a stream. Political and military Although Dhaid is controlled by the Shaikh of Sharjah he has not an exclusive interest in the place. His uncle Salim-bin-Sultan and the Shaikhs ol Ajman and Hamriyah all own date plantations at Dhaid, and the unpleasantness ot t e climate m the het weather months is givon as the only reason why the^ do not visit■ Irrs: DHAID 523 the place frequently. There is reason to think that, in event of British or Indian troons the^iterior' at 1™^°^ ' 0 ' an, 1 ^ haid ^ ould the most suitable station for them in the interior, at least during the cold weather.

It lies immediately under the sand dunes which border the plain on the west. This is the point at which, it is said, the Falaj watering the village of Dhaid en ters the Dhaid plain. The valley contains a number of acacias and some Arta which afford grazing to the camels of the Bani Qitab. About midway between the head and the foot of the valley is a well of the same name on the route between Ras-ai- Khaimah Town and Dhaid village. The inhabitants are said to possess cam els, donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats and a considerable num ber of date palms. Near by are a valley called Wadi Ha- qalah, in which the stream that irrigates Dhaid village has its source, and a hill call- ed Jabal Haqalah that is said to over look Wadi Sfuni. r524 DHAID Name.

DHAMlR— One of the three principal towns of the Yemen plateau, in south-western Arabia, which practically mark the eastern boundary of Turkish influence in those territories. It lies sixty-six miles south by east from Sana'a, on the route between that town and Aden^ and is situated in a flat plain on a plateau at an altitude of 7,700 feet, the nearest hill of any size being Haid Hirran, about two miles to the northward. The plain abounds in water, and produces large quantities of grain. Dhamar has been the scene of much strife from the time of its capture by the Karmathians in 280 A. H. down to the recent revolt in Yemen. It is a straggling town of five separate quarters, and though many of the streets are so narrow that only two or three persons can walk abreast, it occupies a comparatively large area for the number of its inhabitants. Dhamar has neither gates nor walls, but it is more or less defended by a series of small, and for the most part mud-built, forts. Three minarets, of which one is out of the perpendicular having been struck by a round shot, dominate the town. Many of the houses are fairly well built of •tone, and contain large rooms, but, generally speaking, the town is in very bad repair, . Dhalaifain is also the name of a Bedouin Cciinpingdha-dha 527 and though of considerable antiquity, can no longer boast of buildings of any architectural pretensions. Inside the town is a large open square on to which looks the Huhumah, or government offices. The hdzirs are mean and narrow, with small, one-storeyed, box like shops with very limited supplies. As is usually the case in oriental towns, all the people of one trade live in the same street. The Jews occupy a separate quarter which is situated to the east of the town and divided from it by a large open space. Dhamar contains about 4,000 inhabitants. It is the seat of a Qaimmaqam, and possesses an ancient university. Near the great square, already referred to, is the principal mosque of the town, a walled enclosure with three large gates facing the city, and a handsome, though damaged, minaret. There is another mosque in amongst the hdzdrs. Both these mosques are built of sun-dried bricks, in the simple undecorative Arab style. There are of course the usual public baths in the town. The Turkish barracks, which were destroyed by the Arabs during the revolt of 1891, are situated outside the town on its south side (Harris 1891-2.) K ' DHAMAR— A village and valley in the Aden Protectorate {q.v.). PHAMAR-AL-GHAR— A village of some size in the Sana'a district of Yemen, south-western Arabia.

DHANK TOWN— Frequently pronounced Dhanch; the second largest town in the Dhahirah district of the Oman Sultanate, pleasantly situated at the mouth of a precipitous opening in the Western Hajar range which forms the exit of Wadi Dhank. Jabal Hafit is visible from Dhank on a clear day. Dhank is divided into an 'Alayah or upper town of about 5, and a Sifalah or lower town of about 7 quarters, each quarter being ^separately walled. The houses are mostly of sun-dried brick. Fine date plantations containing about 3,500 palms and orchards of limes and pomegranates surround the town, and on the outskirts is some cultivation of wheat, lucerne and indigo. Water for irrigation is raised from wells by bullocks. Livestock comprises 14 horses, 80 camels, 250 donkeys, 350 cattle and 1,100 sheep and goats. The population of Dhank is about 3,500 souls, belonging to various sections of the Na'im and some other tribes : in the 'Alayah, which consists of 400^houses, the people are all Na'im; in the Sifalah, containing 300 houses, they are Na'im of the 'Ayal 'Aziz, 'Ayal Hiyah, Shawamis and Wahaishah sections and Shakur. {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) DHANK (W adi)— Or Wadi Dhanch ; also called Wadi Fida. One of the two chief valleys in the district of Dhahirah in the Sultanate of 'Oman ; it begins in Western Hajar near Najd-al-Wuqbah, on the opposite side of which pass Wadi-al- 'Ahin, going to Batinah, has its rise. From its head to about Yanqul the direction of Waii Dhank is apparently from north to south, but below Yanqul it runs almost due westward; its final exit from the hills of Western528 DHANNAH Hajar is by a precipitous gorge just above the town of Dhank. On the upper side of the gorge the valley is half a mile broad, with banks 100 feet high and a fine stream of water in the middle, flowing above ground ; at this spot was fought the battle of Dhank in 1870 between Saiyid 'Azzan and Saiyid Turki, of which the ultimate result was the ruin of 'Azzan's cause and the accession of Turki to the Sultanate. The chief places in Wadi Dhank from above downwards are :— Name. Position. Houses and inhabit ants. ' R emarks.

But On the right bank, 2 miles below Fida. 100 houses of Bidah and Sa'idah. There are date plan tations containing 1,000 palms. Dhank Town • • • • • • • • See article Dhank Town. A mile or two below Dhank town, Wadi Dhank is joined on its right bank by Wadi Abu Kurbah, which has a sandy bed and banks thickly clad with tamarisk. It also receives from the east, at some point below Dhank town, a wddi called Wadi-al-Jailah, in the upper course of which is situated a village Khadal composed of 100 houses of Jarawinah (Bani Kalban). Wadi Dhank then continues on its way towards the Ruba'- al-Khali in which it is lost. _^^he^total population of Wadi Dhank and its affluents is about 7,300 souls.— (Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf).

Water is obtained by digging 2 feet in the watercourse. Sunnis assume the Ihram here. Burton refers to a place caUed Az Zaribah, the ninth halting place on the route from Al-Madinah to Mecca, which is about north of the latter, and distant from it 47 miles by road. He describes it as an un dulatmg plain amongst high granite hills, in many parts faintly green, water beins close to the surface, and ram standing upon the ground. He further states that Az* Zanbah is the m^a/, or appointed place for assuming the Ihmm, In these circum stances it would seem that the two places are identical.

He says that at Dhat-al Hajj there is pasturage and a palm grove, and that the flood-water from Jabal-ash-Sharrah reaches here. The railway station which consists of two buildings and a siding, is a quarter of a mile west of the old stone fort, on the pilgrim route. After rain, water stands in pools between the station and the fort, and also along the line itself. There are usually half a dozen Zaptiehs in the qaVah.— {Maunsell) BHAWAHTR— A considerable Arab tribe who have their headquarters in the Baraimi Oasis and inhabit its neighbourhood practically the whole Baraimi Oasis except the villages of Sa'arah and Baraimi belongs to them. They number perhaps 4,500 souls and are divided into 3^ sections, the Daramikah, who inhabit Hili, Ma'ataradh and Qatarab.; the Jawabir, who are confined to 'Ain ; and the Bani Sa'ad, who own Jimi In politics the Dhawahir are Hinawiyah ; in religion Muwalik. In summer all of them inhabit vil lages ; in winter the entire community become Bedouins. They own large flocks of sheep and many camels ; they are charcoal-burners and carry their charcoal for sale to the coast of Trucial 'Oman and elsewhere, on their own camels. The Dhawahir have probably little cultivation elsewhere than in Baraimi, unless, as some assert, the Bani Sa'ad of Ghunah and Mad-hah in Shamaillyah belong to this tribe. Politically the Dhawahir of Baraimi are subservient to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom they even pay tribute ; and it is not unlikely that, if they were to avail themselves of their numerical superiority and of his assistance, they might be able to possess themselves of the whole oasis.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gvlf.)

DHIDAH— See Qasim, 3Y3DHRtJMAH 533 BHRUMAH— A large village in the 'Aridh district of Najd, memorable chiefly for the resistance which it offered to the Egyptian forces in 1818 and for the severity with which it was treated after being taken by them. Dhrumah appears to be situated about 35 miles to the south-east of Barrah and about the same distance to the west-south-west of Riyadh. It stands in a plain of some extent which receives the drainage of three valleys from the western slopes of Jabal Tuwaiq 5 of these the northernmost begins in Jabal Kharshah a portion of the Tuwaiq range ad- Joining Haislyah; the middle one is B5dhah and the southernmost is Saqtah. To the south-east and north-east of Dhrumah are the Tuwaiq hills, to the south west is a sandy desert, and to the north-west is a plain across which lies the route to Shaqrah in Washam. The hollow in the Dhrumah plain down which passes the combined drainage of the valleys from Jabal Tuwaiq leaves the village of Dhrumah on its right bank, but the date groves of the village are watered from wells in its bed ; from Dhurmah it trends east-south-eastwards, traverses Jabal Tuwaiq, and enters Wadi Hanifah a short Way below Hair but near enough to that place to irrigate a portion of its date gardens. Between Dhrumah and Hair, at several miles from Dhrumah, a village called Mizahmlyah is passed upon the right bank, and several miles further on another village, named Rod hah, also on the right bank ;* the lands of both these places are partly watered from the hollow, which as it approaches Hair receives the name of Sail Hair. Before reaching Hair it is joined—apparently from the left — by another hollow, called Maghnfiyah, from Jabal Tuwaiq. The route from Dhrumah to Riyadh lies by Mizah- miyah and thence over the high portion of Jabal Tuwaiq known as Abaljid ; the whole journey occupies about 12 hours, and the latter three-fourths of the way are hilly and difficult* The way direct from Dhrumah to Hair lies over a more southern and less televated part of Jabal Tuwaiq called Maghrifiyah, and the journey is apparently a longer one than that to Riyadh. These are the routes used by travellers moving lightly or in fear of robbers; but a strong caravan with laden camels would, it is said, go by Hair following the natural valley which leads from Dhrumah to that place. The following table gives the usual particulars of the villages of Dhrumah, Mizahmivah and Rodhah :— J Name. Position. Houses and inhabitants. Remarks. Dhrumah See above 300 houses, viz., about 150 of Bani Khadhir and on the average about 25 each of ?

This seems tlie most conveninet place in which to refer to the torrent bed of Abalji- lat which, though not directly connected with Dhrumah, adjoins it on the southward, being situated (apparently) in the hills of Jabal Tuwaiq between Dhrumah and the Hariq district. It is said to rise in the same neighbourhood as the Nisah tributary of Wadi Hanifah; but its direction must be different, for, after passing a village called Jau-as-Saibani, it runs southwards to Khashm-adh-Dhib in the Hariq district, where it ends. Only in times of exceptional flood does its water reach to Khashm-adh-Dhib. The village of Jau-as-Saibani is a poor and scattered one ; it ordinarily consists of 40 houses of slaves only. Bani Tamim, however, from Dhrumah and Mizahmlyah, come here to cultivate in the cold weather. There are no date trees and no lucerne, but wheat, barely, millet and melons are grown. Water is at 4 fathoms from the ground level.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) DHU ? AMIR— A small settlement in Yemen, South-western Arabia.

DHUFAR* (or) District— Th e term Dhufar is properly used to describe the maritime plain on south coast f Arabia which extends enclosed between the Samhan hills and the sea, from Has Risut eastwards for 30 miles to Khor Rori. It is also used in a restricted sense to designate the villages of Hafah and Salalah, which together contain two-thirds of the entire settled population of the same pW In a wider sense, however, as the name of a district, Dhufar denotes^ the whole coastal tract, from and including the village of Kharifot on the west to Ras Nus on the east, which is in the possession of the Sultan of Oman and forms a separate district of the 'Oman Sultanate. It is in the last of these three meanings that the word is employed in the present article ; Dhufar Proper is dealt with separately under that title. The eastern and western limits of the Dhuflr district as just defined approximately coincide with those of the Qara tribe Extent, The district of Dhufar, as defined above, has a length west by south and Ic^Liles S a maxlmura brcadth i^nd, in Dhufar Proper, of about Physical geography-The greater part of the district does not merit a detailed des- cnption^t consists of barren hills at no great distance from the sea, interrupted here and there byshort insignificant valleys. The only valley of importance is Wadi RnilS? which reaches the coast at Hasik and is said to have its head Fn the far interior The bilk though in places irregular in direction and discontinuous, really form one ranee which is generally known by the name of Jabal Samhan. In two places onlydoi Z range recede perceptibly from the coast; one of these is between R5s Nils and MurbSt where a belt of low land 6 to 12 miles broad, rocky and desolate in the extreme but containing some hares and gazelles besides a few date trees in a ravine towaX Rff, Nus, is left between the hills and the sea ; the other is the plain of Dhufar Proper of which the extreme points upon the coast have been already mentioned Chmate. -—Situated as Dhufar is on the shore of the Arabian Sea, its seasons are regulated chiefly by the monsoons. The south-west monsoon, whkh brings Jn ordinarily amves about the Uth of June and is sometimes preceded by 10 davs bv a severe gale from the south or south-east. In December aod January the the air of Dhufar is pleasant and salubrious. y oi Inhabitants. —The two great tribes of the district aro fhn Harac * and theh-fl 6 f^Th^n' Al , Kathir ' who inhabit the plain of DtaflrVZer and the hills also. The Qaras have a language of their own and the ll Katto are believed to speak an Arabic dialect which differs considerablv from Gulf. The villagers are indolent agriculturists and hke most toZAraL !,^ ^ and much addicted to tobacco. Other tribes known in Dhufar are the T a Bait-al-Qalam of the former of whom there are 20, and of the latter a W h ^ atMurbat; Saiyids or Sadat and Mashaikh, boih ^ moX ^T /^ Murbat and Taqa ; the Hasanfc or Hasrit, a'Bedouin Tribe t ^v ^f fcha^t I II The cLrt f536 DHUFAR ordinarily inhabit a country said to lie three or four days' journey to the east of Dhufar ; and the Harasls, a tribe of which stray members are seen now and again in Dhufar, having come, it is believed, from a long distance. A few Mahras and Hikman are found at Murbat in Dhufar, and the district is adjoined on the west by Mahra terri tory. Formerly there were a few Indian traders in Dhufar, now there are none. The blood-feud flourishes in Dhufar and is at times so prevalent that two inhabitants can hardly pass one another without a Rabi or guarantor. This was particularly the case in 1845, when frightful anarchy prevailed and there was a general desire for British protection. The condition of affairs has been somewhat ameliorated since the effective occupation of Dhufar by the Sultan of 'Oman, but population is said to be still decreasing. The former rulers of the country, whose ruined villages cover the plain of Dhufar Proper, are called by the present people the Minquwi. Population. —As will be apparent from the table at the end of this article and from that in the article on Dhufar Proper, the population of the whole district must be about 11,000 souls, composed as follows :— Settled inhabitants of Dhufar Proper .. ., ., %9 3,000 Settled inhabitants of the remainder of the district .. .. 1,500 Kara Bedouins ,. .. .. .. ,, M f 4250 Al Kathir Bedouins .. .. .. .. ., ^ 2,000 Other Bedouins (Hasarlt, etc.) .. .. .. .. .. 250 T otal . . 11,000 Communications and •Communication between Dhufar and the outside- world is hampered by various obstacles. The coast possesses no large harbour and land ing is generally difficult on account of surf, though the bays of Murbat and Risut afford good anchorage for small vessels in the north-east and south-west monsoons, respectively. Practically no sea-going boats are owned in Dhufar, but there are about 40 Horis and io Shashahs. The plain of Dhufar could be crossed with field guns, but the track along the coast which connects the plain with the Murbat anchorage would be difficult for artillery. The gaths in the Samhan hills become altogether impassable in the rainy season. The Al Kathir and Qara tribes possess many camels ; other transport animals are scarce. A land route connects Salalah in Dhufar with Adam in 'Oman Proper, but it is an arduous one and the journey occupies about a moflth ; water in some parts is met with only at intervals of two marches. This route leaves Dhufar by Wadi Jarziz, traverses the district called Qatan behind Jabal Samhan, approaches the sea at Jazir and then bears direct for Adam, passing on the way through a locality called Dhahr. There is no direct route between Dhufar and Central Arabia. Trade, shipping and resources. —There are no manufactures. By far the most valu- able export is frankincense from the Samhan hills, which is mostly carried to Bombay in native boats, about 9,000 ewt. being sent there annually. Other exports are hides, sheep-skins, gums, bees' wax, bitter aloes, and at times ghi; these also are for the most part hill products. Imports are chiefly rice, sugar, jowari, dates and dyed cloth from Bombay; but small quantities of goods are brought also from Aden and Mukalla, particularly tobacco from Mukalla; and in summer a few traders in piece-goods visit Dhufar from Shihr, returning to their homes in the cold weather. The best quality, which Dhufar people call liban laid, is obtained at spots called Hoye and Haski, about four days' journey inland from Murbat, where the Qara mountains slope down towards the Najd desert. The second quality known as liban resimi comes from near Cape Risut. Some of marketable quality comes from Chisen near Rakhyut.— {Bent, pages 252-3). One sea-going boat was formerly owned in Dhufar ; it was a hadan which made voyages between Murbat and Makalla, but it has now disappeared. Boatg from Makalla, *3ur, Bahrain and Kuwait frequently call at Dhufar to trade or to obtain provisions, and business with Bombay is carried on chiefly by means of boats belonging to Sur. Dhufar merchants used occasionally to charter Indian hidiyahs from Sind, but this is no longer done and trade is said to be falling off.DHUFAR 537 Boats from the Persian Gulf generally visit or pass Dhufar in November and December - some return before the monsoon, but others better equipped linger till the Tadbirah or premonitory symptoms of the monsoon in June, or even till the first blast of the monsoon itself. These boats carry dates on their outward, and coffee on their return voyage. The smaller craft of the coast about Masirah fish in fleets along the shore towards Dhufar in winter and return home with the current in March or April. The inhabitants of Dhufar believe themselves independent of foreign-trade, and lu i they COuld subsist b y their own cultivation and flocks and herds if intercourse with the outer world were to be interrupted; this is possibly true in regard to food, but a blockade would certainly reduce them to great straits for clothing. The products of the Dhufar district are described in the articles on Dhufar Proper and »Jabal bamhan. No minerals of commercial value are certainly known to exist, but an easily worked not very durable buildins: stone is quarried near Ralalah. Administration . This remote district of the 'Oman Sultanate is ruled by a Wall who is appointed from 'Oman by the Sultan. The late Wali, Sulaiman-bin-Suwailim, tiad been almost continuously absent from Dhufar for 9 years before his death in 1907 and his duties were carried on by a resident deputy-governor. The revenue derived from sea-customs amounts to $5,000 a year, or more, and there are taxes on animals and a tax on agriculture ; the last, known as Zakat, is fixed at ^ of the gross produce and is estimated to bring in about $15,000 a year. The taxes are mostly received in kind, and the late Wall was accustomed to send the goods thus collected to an agent whom he mamtamed at Bombay, where they were converted into cash. The revenue realised only suffices to cover the expenses of government and no surplus is ever remitted to' Masqat. The military force is fluctuating and consists of 50 to 200 'Askaris or armed levies who are paid from the local revenues: at present the number is about 60 distributed etween Murbat, Salalah, Hafah and Risut. These levies are now mostly local men not Omanis ; in their number we have not included the personal retinue of the deputv' governor m the Hisn. F J . Topography.

On the coast 13 miles west of Ras Sajar. At the western ex tremity of Dhufar Proper. Nature. A small sandy bay, 2i miles wide at the entrance and IJ miles deep; it is sheltered from the north and east but open to the south: the soundings are irregular from 8 to 26 fathoms. A village of 60 or 70 mud houses inhabit ed by Qaras of the Bait 'Ak'ak, Bait Hardan, Bait 'Isa and Bait Shamasah sections; it stands at the mouth of a ravine of the same name and is sepa rated from Safqot to the east by a mountainous ridge scarped on the side towards the sea. A bay facing the east with a promontory of the same name on the south side of it. The bay is about 1 mile broad by half a mile deep. The beach is sandy R emaeks. day. The popula tion, consisting of 20 households of Jannabah, is poor and nearly naked; they inhabit low circular huts, built of stone, date branches and sea-weed^ upon the cape. They have 60 sheep and but no boats. A limestone hill called Jabal Qinqari with veins of chalk and gypsum overlooks the bay ; it is 1,300 feet high. The village stands on the west side of a creek, on the oppo site side of which is a tower built by the 'Omani Wali of Dhufar to keep off the attacks of hostile Mahras. B-akhyut has increased consi derably in the last 20 years in consequence of the expansion of the frankincense trade. Rakhyut is also called Qamar and occasionally Sa'duni from the name of a former chief. In the bay stands a mud-built bazaar of 15 or 20 shops, con structed by the Wali of Dhufar and per manently occupied by Dhufar traders. In the trading sea-DHUFAR 539 Name. Kori (Khor) Position.

The promontory is 200 feet high and 1 mile broad at its base ; it is covered with traces of human occupation, includ ing a cemetery, 3 acres in extent. A remarkable lake or inlet of the sea run ning a mile or more inland ; it is the es tuary of Wadi Dirbat from Jabal Samhan. A small village on the sea at the mouth of a wddi of the same name. There are 1 or 2 houses and about 20 caves, on both sides of the valley, inhabited by Qaras of the Ahl 'Umr section. R emarks. son, between March and September, the number of shops in creases to 40 or 50. A guard of 10 or 15 'askaris is always posted here. A tor rent bed reaches the bay through a small lagoon ; 1J miles up this ravine is a fresh water spring. Boats from Sur and Mas qat town call here, but none belong to the place. There are 300 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. The inlet is divided from the sea by a sand bar over which the water flows at high tide. A pen insula, once fortified, adjoins the east side of the entrance. Remains of ancient buildings surround the lake. There is a fortified rock at the entrance to the inlet, which is called Kha- tiyah. This harbour is the ancient Mos- cha, or Abyss Apolis. The Wali of Dhufar formerly maintained a post of 15 'Askaris here, but it has been abolished; there are a few store-houses. The place depends on the frankincense trade. Thre are no boats except from other places. Cattle number 600 and goats and sheep 1,000. r540 DHUFlE Name. Position. Nature. R emarks. Safqofc .. On the coast 9 miles west of Ras Sajar. A small village said to consist of 10 houses of Jannabah ; it is at the mouth of a deep ravine which here comes down to the sea. The people inhabit caves in the sides of the valley. They do not recognise the authority of the Wall of Dhufar, but they give no trouble. Sajar (Ras) (Also pronounced Sagar and Sayir). On the coast 32 miles west-south west of Risut. The largest, but not the most striking cape on the south ern coast of Arabia. The sea around it is very deep. The summit is 3,380 feet above the sea, and the bluff extremity 2,770 feet, but the cape does not pro ject much from the mam land. The eastern side is not so high as the western, owing to the strata dipping to the east, but it is perpendicularly scarped. The south south-west side des cends in 3 or 4 grand steps to the sea. Ras Sadar is a part of the Samhan moun tains ; it consists of white and grey lime stone. Its sides, where not perpendi cular, are covered with trees, and the plains at the top witb long, grass. There are caverns inhabited by Jannabah on both sides, but chiefly on the eastern. The people are poor fishermen, about 20 in num ber, owning a few small, roughly made horia. The Govern ment of India in 1879 fixed this.cape as the boundary be tween the political jurisdictions of its officers at Masqat and Aden r the con venience of the ar rangement is now open to question as the Wali of Dhufar has established his control at Rakhyut 13 miles to the west ward. ^allikot Between Rakhyut and Kharifot.

Nature R emarks. Salah In the hills eastwards of Murbat, from which it is said to be dis tant two days' jour ney. a valley .. This valley can only be reached on foot. It contains 12 huts of Qaraa who own 150 cattle and 200 sheep and goats and import maize from Murbat. Salalah is the largest place in Dhufar: the second is Murbat which is the principal port of the district.— (Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) DHUFAR PROPER— Boundaries. —A low-lying maritime plain in the Dhufar District, to which it gives its name ; it is bounded by the sea on the south and the Samhan hills on the north, and extends from Rlsut On the west to Khor Rori on the east. Its length is thus about 30 miles, and its greatest depth about 9 miles. The Dhufar plain is the only fertile stretch between Aden and Masqat. Physical characteristics. —The plain consists of miliolitic or freestone deposits covered by a rich alluvium; its elevation above the sea is trifling, and it is famed among Arabs as the most fertile and favoured district on the southern coast of Arabia. Numerous watercourses from the hills traverse the plain to the sea the chief of which is the Wadi Gharzid (or Jarziz), and about a dozen of these, where they reach the shore, form creeks of which the water is partially fresh ; some are well-wooded and grassy inland, and some are densely grown with mangroves at the coast. Parts of the country are covered with a coarse grass which dries up in winter, and in places there is a jungle of acacia. Water is found everywhere at a few feet from the surface ; the wells are from 5 to 20 feet deep ; and for three months in the year the district gets the benefit of the south-west monsoon. At its west end the plain ends in a cul-de-sac 100 feet above sea-level, behind a coast range of which the Risut promontory is a prolongation. At the east end it is connected with Murbat by a narrow maritime plateau which, from Khor Rori to a point four miles short of Murbat, is 100 feet above the sea except at breaches made by ravines. The coast from Taqa for 5 miles to the westward consists of cliff about 10 feet high ; and from that point as' far as Daharlz it is low and is skirted by a mangrove swamp half a mile deep. There is generally a heavy surf upon the beach ; and the landing, which is effected in catamarans, is ordinarily difficult or at least unpleasant. Population. —From the topographical table at the end of this article it may be de- deduced that the fixed population of Dhufar Proper numbers about 3,000 souls and it will be seen that nearly all belong to the A1 Kathir tribe. The people, both nomads and non-nomads, wear their hair long and collect it by a fillet round their heads ; Saiyids, however^ and the poorest classes have their heads shaved. The ordinary inhabitant of Dhufar has only one garment, a dark-blue sheet six cubits long by three broad, which forms a kilt by day and is his only bedding at night. Agriculture and animals. —The principal crops are bajri, maize, millet, cotton, and a little wheat and sugar-cane. There are no dates. Cocoanuts grow, but there is no surplus for export. Fruits are water and musk-melons, papai and a few plantains and mulberries. Some tobacco is produced, but the quantity is insufficient even for local consumption. Vegetables include hindis, and red pepper is grown; brinjals are seen, but only in the Wali's garden. Ploughs are not in use ; the ground is tilled with spade or hoe. The people own camels, cattle, sheep and goats, but have no horses and few donkeys; the goats are of a peculiar and rather handsome variety known throughout 'Oman as Dhufar goats. Fish abound and acres of a small fish called 'aid resembling r542 DHUFAR PEOPEB the sardine, may be seen drying near villages. Gazelle, hysenas and foxes are met with where there is cover. Administration. —Dhufar Proper is the only part of the Dhufar District which is effectively controlled by the Wali. The late Wali had his headquarters in the Hisn or fort upon the shore between Salalah and Hafah, a country residence and fort at EizSt and a house and gardens at Hamran. Topography. —The following are the principal places in Dhufar Proper :— Name. 'Auqad .. Bilad* or Balad-al- Qadimah or Balaid. Position. The westernmost village in Dhufar plain, 4 miles west of Salalah, four miles north-east of Risut, and about one mile from the sea. On the coast J a mile east of Hafah, from which it is divided by cotton fields and groves of cocoanut palm. Nature. A village of about 75 occupied mud houses divided into two quarters with an in terval of half a mile between. The quar ter to the west is 'Auqad Bait Fadhil and has 60 houses ; the other is ' Auqad Bait Marhun which has now only 15 oc cupied houses. The quarters are named from the sections of the Al- Kathir tribe who inhabit them. A ruined site cover ing an area two miles in length by 600 yards in breadth The fortified por tion of the ancient town, at its east end, stretched for 1,240 yards along the sea, had a depth inland of 500 yards and was encircled on the three land ward sides by a great ditch of fresh water. The citadel at the north-west corner of this quar ter-still rises 30 feet above the plain. The ruins of the unfortified part of the town are exten- K emarks. The inhabitants culti vate maize and bajri and collect frankin cense. The water- supply is from wells two or three fathoms deep. There are no boats. Cattle num ber about 600 and sheep and goats the same. Midway between Salalah and 'Auqad a stream be ginning in a fresh water spring runs down with a zigzag course to the sea ; its banks are marshy and abound in fowl. Half a mile north of 'Auqad are the ruins of a fort. The ruins contain many sculptured re mains, some Muham mad an, some pos sibly pre-Islamitic : among the former, near the north-east corner of the ruins, is the marble tomb stone, admirably preserved and bear ing the date 710 A. H., of Malik Ibrahim-bin- Mud- haffar, who accord ing to tradition was the first Arab ruler of Dhufar. Not far from Bilad is the shrine of 'Abdul- lah-as-Samiri, a saint from Malabar, whose intercessionDHUFAR PEOPER 543 - Name. Position. Nature.

Village of 100 mud and stone houses of the A1 Fadhil and other sections of the A1 Kathir. The place is in a ruinous condition. On the west side are cotton fields and a grove of cocoanut palms. The people are fisher men and cultivat ors ; there are 10 small fishing boats, 1,000 cattle and 300 sheep and goats. Dahariz was once the capital of Dhu far. Hafah .. About 2 miles east of Salalah on the coast, along which it ex tends quarter of a mile. i Village of 150 houses of stone and mud ; some however are uninhabited. About 25 families are low caste fishermen; the rest are A1 Kathir Arabs of the Shana- firah section. There are a few co coanut gardens. There are no manu factures. Hamran About 12 miles east of Salalah and two miles from the sea. House and gardens, with a spring and watercourse, which belonged to the late Wali of Dhufar. Fruit, tobacco and vegetables are grown here by Bayasirah cultivators, immi grants from 'Oman. Hisn .. ,. About 100 yards from the beach at a point half a mile west of Hafah and 1| south-east of Salalah. The principal fort in Dhufar of the Sultan of 'Oman: it was built several years ago by the Wali Sulaiman, covers about an acre of ground, and con tains a substantial there-storeyed build ing. The entrance is on the east side. Outside the fort is a small enclosed ba zaar of 6 shops, near which are a few huts. Rizat .. About eight miles east of Salalah and one and-a-half miles from the sea. A fort built by the late Wali of Dhufar and garrisoned by 10 levies. Near by are some 10 mud houses inhabited by The lands are irrigat ed by a water-course from a Wadi of the same name.

A deserted site with standing columns, etc. The remains cover many acres, but are not appa rently very ancient. There was a small vil lage here as lately as 1844, but it has since been abandoned on account of the de predations of the hill Qaras. Salalah .. See article Salalah. Taqa The easternmost vil lage in the Dhufar Proper two miles west of Khor Rori and 20 miles west of Murbat. A village of about 20 mud huts and one stone building, chiefly inhabited by Ma'ashani Qaras. There are three or four families of Sharifs and a few of Mashaikh ; these latter classes act as mediators and go- betweens to the Be douins, among whom their persons are sacred, and they take charge of the flocks and herds of Bedouins while in the plains. The mountains here come down close to the sea and make a pleasing background. There are many an cient remains, stand ing columns, stone sarcophagi, etc. There was formerly a good harbour here, but it has now be come silted up. This, with a little outlay, could be re-opened. —{Bent, page 240.) DHUHAH— A small village in southern Yemen.

BIBAH— A coast village of the Ras-al-Khaimah District in Trucial 'Oman, situated 1 mile south of Bai'ah on the western shore of a sandy bay which is 6 miles in breadth and open from north-north-east to east ; it is connected by a route, which runs via the Qaliddi pass, with Ras-al-Khaimah Town on the other side of the'Oman Promontory. Dibah is the frontier village, in this part, of Sharjah ; Bai'ah, the next to the northi divided from Dibah merely by a small Wadi coming down to. the sea, belongs to the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the Oman Sultanate, Bai'ah is ordinarily included under the name ' Dibah ' ; but it is really distinct from Hisn-ad-Dibah or Dibah proper and should not be confounded with it. Dibah is held as a fief by Rashid-bin-Ahmad, a first cousin of the Shaikh of Sharjah ; he resides in the place and is described as Wali : the neighbouring village of Wamm is subject to his administration, and he receives the Zakat on dates from the village of Muhtarqah in Wadj-al-Qaliddi. The population of Dibah may be about 1,000 souls: there are 100 houses of the peasant class called Bayadlr, 50 of the 'Awanat tribe, 15 of Naqbiym and 10 of Sharqiyln. To the south of the place are extensive date plantations containing, it is estimated, about 10,000 palms. The water is good and the wells about 4 fathoms deep. Livestock are 20 camels, 50 don keys and 700 sheep and goats.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) BIBAH (H isn-ad)— See Dibah. BIBAH (R as)— A projecting point of cliffs of moderate height, with a small islet cables northward of it, and a channel with from 2 to 3 fathoms between the islet and the shore. In the bay, one mile to the westward, is a white patch on the cliffs. The bay is about six miles wide, and the depths decrease gradually from 15 fathoms to the sandy beach. The town and fort are about 5 miles westward of Ras Dibah.—( Persian Gulf Pilot, 1908.) BIBAI TOWN— The capital and only town of the principality of the same name : it is situated on the coast of Trucial 'Oman, 7 miles south-west of the town of Sharjah and 79 miles north east of the town of Abu Dhabi. At sea 20 miles to the west-south-west of Dibai town is 'Alaiwi, the easternmost and nearest of the Persian Gulf pearl banks. Dibai stands on both sides of a creek, with a shallow and difficult entrance, which ex tends for some miles beyond the town in a south-easterly direction,' there is a small quay for vessels able to go inside. The town consists of three main quarters r of these the principal is Dairah, which stands on a tongue of land about 20 feet high on the north east side of the creek between it and the sea, and has a date grove'a mile in extent behind it. Dairah contains about 1,600 houses,—inhabited by Arabs, Persians, Baluchis and others,—and the main bazaar of 350 shops. The other two quarters' Shandaghah and Dibai proper, lie on the south-west side of the creek, Shandaghah being the nearer to the sea. Shandaghah is the residence of the Shaikh of the Abu Dhabi Principality and contains some 250 houses all occupied by Arabs ; Indians are not allowed to establish themselves here. Dibai proper contains about 200 houses and 50 shops, also the principal mosque and some ruins said to be those of a Portuguese fort • the Indians are all collected in this quarter. Ferry boats ply between Dairah and Bibai proper, and on Fridays the crossing is free to inhabitants of Dairah who go toDIB—DIB 547 worsliip in the Jami' mosque. The town was once walled, but the wall is now in ruins ; on the landward side, however, there are a number of towers of defence. The water supply for Shandaghah is obtained from wells on the plain at a place called Jumairah some three miles distant. These wells are really water-holes which are dug and then filled up again when no longer required. Water is found at a depth of 4 to 6 feet. The supply for Dairah is obtained from 5 or 6 wells which are situated near some date groves 5 or 6 miles out. These wells are apparently dug in hard ground, and contain water at about 12 feetv The water is carried into the town in skins on donkeys or camels, and in earthenware vessels by women. It is of good quality considering the nature of the country, and there is never any scarcity of it. The population of Dibai town, in all about 15,000 souls or rather more, consists of the following elements: Bani Yas of the AlBu Falash and Sabaissections, A1 Bu Mahair, mixed tribes, chiefly Arabs and including Mazari' and natives of Bahrain and Kuwait, Persians, from various districts of Persia, 250 houses; Sudan Baluchis, natives of the Hasa Oasis, houses ; Marar, and Shwaihiyin. Nearly all of these are Sunnis of the Maliki sect. There are also many settled Hindus and Khdjahs, British subjects, inclusive of women and children, and in the pearl season many other Hindus visit the place. Date trees number about 4,000, but the yield is scantly : the only other cultivation is a little lucerne. Dibai town is reckoned to possess 1,650 camels, 45 horses, 380 donkeys, 430 cattle and 960 goats. About 335 pearl boats, 50 fishing boats and 20 sea-gonig vessel, the last being chiefly Sambuks and Badans, belong to the place, and 10 to 12 boats are built annually. The ruler of Dibai is Shaikh Sa'id Ibn Maktum, who succeeded his cousin But! Ibn Suhail in 1912, and is at feud with the latter's family. He is a wealthy chief, owing to the commercial importance of his capital, a but his relations with the Indian Govern ment have not been uniformly good ; in August 1913 he had to be warned because a boat of H. M, S. Sphinx was fired on from the town. There had been trouble under previous rulers, chiefly owing to the use of Dibai by smugglers of arms. The trade of Dibai is considerable and is rapidly expanding. Dibai has now sup planted Lingeh as the chief entrepot of the foreign trade of Trucial 'Oman. Dibai is now a port of call for the steamers of the British India and of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Companies, the vessels of the former calling regularly once a fortnight and those of the latter at intervals as opportunity offers. The only exports of local origin are pearls, mother-of-pearl shells and dried fish. The imports are dates from Basrah, Minab and Batinah; also rice, wheat, piece-goods, spices, metals, coir-rope and timber, chiefly from India, The town contains some 400 shops and 200 warehouses, A large portion of the imports are destined for the interior, particularly for the Baraimi Oasis. Of the local merchants 23 are Hindus and 7 are Khojahs under British protec- tion.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf; Murphy.) DIBAI PRINCIPALITY— An independent Arab Principality on the coast of Trucial 'Oman; its political position is explained in the article on that country, Dibai is situated between the Shaikhdoms of Sharjah on the north and Abu Dhabi on the south, meeting Sharjah on the coast at Abu Hail which lies partly on one side of the border and partly on the other, and Abu Dhabi at Khor Ghanadhah, a creek described in the article on the Abu Dhabi Princi pality, which runs inland for many miles and divides the principalities one from the other. Jabal-al-'Ali, the only hill on this coast, is in Dibai territory : it is 220 feet high, flat-topped, and lies 19 miles south-west of Dibai Town and 4 miles inland, being sepa rated from the sea by a strip of low desert. It is often called Jabail. The people are Biyadiyah. Inland the extent of the influence of the Shaikh of Dibai is doubtful. The village of Hajaram, 50 miles south-east of Dibai Town in Wadi Hatta, at the present time recog nises him as overlord; but the origin of the connection is exceptional and the place must be regarded as an isolated dependency, for there are villages nearer to Dibai Town which do not acknowledge the Shaikh's authority. 4 a 2 r548 DIB—DIB Besides Dibai Town and the village of Hajarain, the latter being merely a distant protectorate, the only permanently inhabited place in the principality is Jumairah, a coast village about 3 miles south-west of Dibai Town; it consists of 45 date branch huts and is inhabited by Bani Yas, Manasir and mixed tribes who are all fisher m en and own among them 5 camels, 60 donkeys, 45 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. None of the Bedouin tribes are expressly attached to Dibai and the only recognised subjects of the Shaikh are accordingly the inhabitants of Dibai Town, of Jumairah and of Hajarain. The trade, shipping, etc., of the principality are simply those of the capital. The Shaikh maintains about 100 retainers armed with Martini rifles, and about 2,000 or more of his ordinary subjects are reported to be similarly armed. There are no cus toms at Dibai Town, but the revenues of the principality are said to amount to $51,400 a year, largely derived from the pearl fisheries.—(^aze^eer of the Persian Gulf.) Jahal-al-'Ali, 17 miles south-westward of Dibai, and 3 miles inland, is a flat-topped hill, 220 feet high, rising gradually from each end; it is the only landmark on or near the coast. DIBAI (Khor)— The western, low, sandy entrance point (Lat. 25° 16' N., Long. 55° 18' E.) of Dibai Ichor is half a mile northwest of the town: it has of late years somewhat extended, and projects slightly. The entrance has 2 feet water, with rocky bottom in places, and is much obstruced by the reef ; the channel winds southward close past the outer entrance point; a spit extends off Dairah point, which is 3 cables south-eastward of the opposite side of the entrance. The khor then turns eastward between the town and Dairah point, where it is 150 yards wide, with from 4 to 5 fathoms water. It extends several miles south-eastward, but, beyond the town, is only used by fishermen. The coast from Dibai trends south-westward 70 miles, to Abu Dhabi; excepting a small village with date trees, about 4 miles south-westward of Dibai, it is quite barren, uninhabited, very low, and uniform in appearance, with tufts of coarse grass growing on the sandhillocks, intersected by creeks, and in places by extensive swamps ; there is no tree larger than a mangrove bush. Although there are no settled inhabitants, landing on the mainland between these towns, except with an armed party, is hazardous, as it is often visited by Bedouins from the interior.

DIBDIBAH — A large district in the Kuwait Pirneipality, situated between Shaqq on the east fehi qq aq on the north, the Batin on the north-west and Summan on the south-west: on the south it ends near Dhula'-al-Mi'aijil. It extends little, if at all, further north than the latitude of Kuwait Town, and its northern end is about 25 miles west of Jahrah. Its total length is thus about 100 miles, and its breadth is perhaps 50. Dibdibah consists of featureless plains, with undulations so slight as to be almost imperceptible and yet sufficient to conceal camels at comparatively short distances • it is almost destitute of landmarks. The district contains some pasture in the season; but it is a very poor country, there are no wells, and the nomads who frequent the northern part of it actually procure their drinking water from Jahrah. A certain number of gazelle are found in Dibdibah.DIB—DIB 549 The chief points of interest are the following :— Name. Position. Nuture. Remarks. 'Amarah (Umm-al-) 10 miles west of Shaqq on the same parrallel of latitude as Riqa'i in the Batin. A depressed tract adjoined by very slightly elevated ground. Water collects here after' rain and there are said to be traces of old and deep wells. Hamir (Umm-al-) 6 miles east of Riqa'i in the Batin. A Khabrah or hollow in which water col lects. The land rises from this place to the bank of the Batin at Riqa'i in 5 or 6 distinct terraces or ridges. These drain towards Umm-al- Hamir. Hiran (Abul) .. About 22 miles west of Shaqq, on the direct route from Kuwait Town to Hafar in the Batin. A1 large Khabrah fed by at least one line of drainage. It is enclosed on the east by a natural ridge. The water holes contain water for a month after ordinary rain. Musannah *, Extends from a point on Falaij-al- Janubiyah, a few miles south of Hafar, to Umm- al-'Amarah, and thence subsides to the Shaqq valley. An undulation which runs from west- south-west to east- north-east, rising as it goes, and forms the highest part of Dibdibah. Musannah is a ridge, but it is barely per ceptible and easily escapes notice. Qara'ah 15 miles south-east of Sala', on the western border of Shaqq. A low plateau Nasi grass is produc ed here which the Bedouins collect and sell at Kuwait Town. Sala • • ., 8 miles east-north- east of Abul Hiran.

Ibn Qu'ud, Ibn-al-Juhaish, and Naif-az-Zu'aili are all in the JazTrah between Rumadi and Hit; they camp with the Shammar. Ibn Qu'ud is head of the camel- breeding part of the tribe, and' Ali Sulaiman of the falldhln ; the former has more armed men, the latter more wealth. The Janabiyin, Mahamdah, Ma'amrah, 'Alwan, and Fahd, are on both banks of the Euphrates between Rumadi and Musaiyib. The Al Bu 'Isa are near Fallujah. The Janabiyin and the Al Bu Saqar are very closely related. It is doubtful whether they belong to the Dilaim or to the 2oba'.

BILAM— The capital and administrative centre Of the Kharj district of southern Najd, and itself sometimes loosely called Khari ; it is situated about 50 miles south by east of Riyadh, and perhaps 35 miles east-north-east of Hautah town. Dilam is walled and is said to consist of three wards styled respectively Samhan, Suq, and Tuwalah. There is a fort within the walls occupied by Ibn Sa'ud's representative, and some of the ordinary houses of the place have upper storeys ; but the principal mosque is a mean construction in the poor Wahhabi style of architecture. There is one large school, the Madrasah Shaikh Makhdhub, besides a number of small ones. According to Leachman Dilam is said to be almost as large as Buraidah. This makes it a far larger and more important town than has hitherto been supposed, and the population might well amount to 6,000 souls or even more. Reports agree in describing the date groves of Dilam as extensive and as containing between 10,000 and 15,000 palms. Wheat and maize are grown, and even a little rice ; there are also citrons, grapes, lemons, figs, pomegranates, melons, and lucerne. Irrigation is from wells of good water, 6 to 8 fathoms in depth, and from the Farzan rivulet described in the article on Kharj. Livestock is estimated at 600 camels, 100 donkeys and 300 cattle. The Riyadh Amir sends bis camels and horses here to graze.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf; Leachman, 1912*)2$0- DIL—DIQ 553 BILPIYEH (Tribe)- See Anafijeh (Tribb). DILIMAH ( Tribe)— See 'Anizah, DILLA (R as)— One of the numerous headlands of Ruus-al-Jibal, in Oman Sultanate. It is a perpen- dieular cliiBP, 200 to 300 feet high, forming the eastern point of a high peninsula, 5 miles long, which separates the inlets Ghubbat Ghazirah {q.v.) and Ghubbat Shabus. On this &amp; peninsula is a remarkable brown-coloured peak, more than 1,000 feet high, with a small round knob on the top at its widest part.—(Perstcw Gvlf Pilot, 1909.) DIMA (W adi)— In the Eastern Hajar of the Oman Sultanate: a valley which rises in a Saih or desert plain to the north of the Baldan-al-Masakirah division of Sharqiyah and, running north wards, joins Wadi Tayin on the right bank at the village of Sidafi. The following are the villages of Wadi Dima in descending order from its head to Sidafi;—Dairah (70 houses), Samut (50 houses), Ghamsah (60 houses), Oaryah (150 houses). Hail (20 houses,) Qutaifi (40 houses), Barkyat (60 houses), Ahla (20 houses), Samhan (50 houses), Hisn (180 houses), Harrah (20 houses), Qabsah (10 houses), 'Auf (80 houses) and Hajir (100 houses). All the villages are on the left bank except Dairah, Harrah and Auf which are on the right bank and Hajir which is on both sides ; the inhabitants, some 4,500 souls, all belong to the Bani Shahaim except those of Hajir who are Bani Ruwahah, Hajir is within sight of Sidafi, Livestock are estimated at 350 camels, 550 donkeys, 600 cattle and 2,500 sheep and goats, distributed approximately in proportion to the size of the villages. Da.te palms number about 50,000, of which the majority are at Hisn (10,000), Qaryah (9,000) and Barkyat (8,000).-—((-ra^/eer of ihe Persian Oulf.) DIMNA (A d)— Aden Protectorate. DIMNAH— A small village in the Qra'ah district of the Kuwait Principality, situated on a low bank of sand about 200 yards from the sea and 6 miles east-south-east of Kuwait Town. The village belongs to the 'Awazim, contains 25 houses, and is inhabited in the cold weather only. In the hot weather the people find employment at the pearl fisheries or in the date gardens on the Shatt-al-Arab. The inhabitants have only 1 or 2 Horis; they fish principally by means of Hadhrahs or tidal weirs upon the beach. A few donkeys and some poultry belong to the village. There are a number of wells, but only a few hold water, which is brackish and hardly more than sufficient for the requirements of the village. There is no recognised headman, and the Shaikh of Kuwait deals direct with the village through the first inhabitant whose presence he can secure. The houses of Dimnah are typical of the country about Kuwait and may therefore be described. They consist of a single room each with a floor-space of 30 feet by 10 feefc. The walls are of mud, 4 feet high, and support a gable roof, 7 feet high at the ridge, of light rafters and Basrah reeds covered with date-leaf matting. The door is low, and there is no window. A fireplace and a slightly raised stand for coffee pots, construct ed of mud, occupy one end of the apartment—(tee^eer of the Persian Gu'f.)

There are three other Nahiyahs besides Diwamyah, in the district, viz., 'Afaj (third class), Budair (fist class) and Dagharah (first class); the Mudirs of the first and last of these were stationed at the villages bearing the same names which are described in the article on the Dagharah canal, and the Mudir of the second had his headquarters at a place called Budair. The town of DiwanTyah is the chef-lieu of the whole Qadha. DIWANlYAH TOWN— The chief town of the Sanjaq of the same name in 'Iraq ; it stands upon the Euphrates about 65 miles below Hillah Town and 75 miles above Samawah Town by the course of that river, and it consists of two portions upon opposite banks united by a boat-bridge of 11 pontoons. The main quarter of Diwaniyah, about ^ of the whole, half composed of brick-built houses and including the Sarai or government offices and the barracks, is upon the left bank of the river bed ; the right-bank quarter consists altogether of houses of sun-dried brick. The town is open and undefended except by a ruinous wall on the left bank : the open desert surrounds it on every side. The Sarai and Barracks are all one building. On the left bank there are about 250 shops, 3 Khans and 6 coffee houses. On the right, 20 shops, 4 Khans and 2 coffee houses. The number of houses on both banks is about a thousand. The population amounts to between 5,000—6,000 souls. About 200 Jews, 9 Christians, 70 Negroes. Date palms, about 2,500.

As is frequently the case with valleys in Arabia, different sections ot this watercourse possess distinctive names. According to Hirsch, Wadi Do'an and Wadi-al-Aisar rise on opposite sides of an offshoot of Jabal Haid, which latter forms the watershed between these two valleys and a third valley named Wadi Huwairi. The same authority considers the name Wadi Do'an to apply to the whole valley as* far as tlaura only. Near that town Wadi Amd joins in from the left, and Wadi-al- 'Ain from the right, and the valley continues under the general name of Wadi-al-'Ain down to its con- fluence w'th Wadi Sirr. In the vicinity of the village of Laghar there are three separate rahabahs, or water channels, in the bed of the valley. These rahabahs seem to mantain separate courses for considerable distance, and to constitute a distinctive, though by no means, unique feature of this valley. Lower down, near where the Sha'ib Ugran joins the mam valley from the right, the mountains on the opposite side fall back some- what and Wad 1 Sirr breaks through from the north-west. The rahabahs of Wadi Do 'an and Wadi Kesr still retain their own names, though the whole valley appears to be henceforth known as Wadi Shibam, and also as Wadi Sirr-Masflah. The course of Wadi Do an may thus be between 50 and 60 miles in length. Hirsch entered Wadi Do'an just below its junction with Wadi-al-Aisar. He describes its bed at this point as bein* thickly covered with mimosa and thorn bushes, and running through a gorge between precipitous banks 1,500 feet in height. He states that the name Wadi Kesr (but not Qasr) for Wadi Do an, is not unknown above Hajarain, but that he heard it men- j iir- j- ! , e ln i,:s .' ower reaches where the Wadi Sirr joins in. Von Wreda erased Wadi Do an at Khoraibah, which is situated at a considerable distance above the junction of the Wadi-al-Aisar with Wadi Do'an. Some geographers consider Wadi Do an to end where it is joined by Wadi-al-Aisar, and to that portion of it below its junction with this tributary down to the point where Wadi Sirr ioins the maio (558 DO'AN Hadhramaut valley, they assign the name of Wadi Kesr. For the purposes of this gazetteer, however, a wider interpretation is given, and the name Wadi Do'an is held to embrace the whole watercourse from its source down to the lower limits of Wadi Kesr; that is to say, the latter is considered to form a portion of the former. This gives the Wadi Do'an a total length of about 80 or 90 miles. From its source down to the small town of Haura its general direction is north, and thereafter, north-east; its principal tributaries in descending order are :— Right hank. Lett bank* Wadi-al-Aisar.

Neither the Dobalah nor the Kurashi ever pay taxes to the Turks* even in peace time the Turks could not pass through their territory. BOGMAN— A fendy of the 'Anizah {q.v.).—[Doughty.) 1)6HAH— Grenerally so styled at the present day, but Bedouins sometimes call it Dfftiat-al-Qatar, and it seems to have been formerly better known as Bida^ {Anglice ' Bidder '): it is the chief town of Qatar and is situated on the eastern side of that peninsula, about 63 miles south of its extremity at Ras Rakan and 45 miles north Of Khor-al- 'Odaid. Harbour. —Dohah stands on the south side of a deep bay, at the south-western comer of a natural harbour which is about 3 miles in extent and is protected on the north east and south-east sides by natural reefs. The entrance, less than a mile wide, is from the east between the points of the reefs ; it is shallow and somewhat difficult, and vessels of more than 15 feet draught cannot pass. The soundings within the basin vary from 3 to 5 fathoms and are regular: ths bottom is white mud or clay^DOHAH 563 Town site and quarters. —The south-eastern point of the bay is quite low ; but the land on the western side is stony desert 40 or 50 feet above the level of the sea. The town is built up the slope of some rising ground between these two extremes and consists of 9 Fariqs or quarters, which are given below in their order from the east to the west and north : the total frontage of the place upon the sea is nearly 2 miles. Name of quarter. Position. Remarks. AlBin-'Ali On Ras-an Nisa'ah, a small promontory at the ex treme east end of the town. Inhabited chiefly by Al Bin- 'Ali, whence the name. Sulutah Ditto Named after the Sujutah, who are the principal occupants. There are also some Baqaqalah here. Mur qab- ash- Shar qi Adjoins and is continuous with Fariq-as-Sulutah. The people are mostly Ma'adhld, Manana'ah and Sulutah. Dohah Follows Murqab-ash-Sharqi without an interval. Founded later than Bida' by Al Bu 'Amain who afterwards removed to Wakrah, The present inhabitants are Huwalah, Ma'adhid and Persians ; there are also Al Bin- 'Ali, Arabs from Najd, Baharinah and Dawasir. In this quarter is the main bazaar of about 50 shops; also a hereditary mansion of the Al Thani, the most important Arab family in Qatar. Duwaihah Separated from Dohah by a slight interval in which is a cemetery. Inhabited by Baharinah, Huwalah and other tribes. This quarter was formerly known as D6hat-as- Saghirah. Qal'at-al-'Askar Stands inland of Duwailah, of which quarter it was originally part, upon some what higher ground. Here is the fort of Dohah, by the Turks called Qasr Kunarah, which accommodates the Trukish military garrison and some Turkish officials. It was built originally about 1850 by Al M^sallam whom the Shaikh of Bahrain brought in to counterbalance the Sudan of Bida', The accom modation of the troops is wretched. Murqab-al-Gharbi .. Extends along the shore, forming a gap about 600 yards long in the town front. At present deeerted. 4c^ r564 DOHAH Name of quarter. Position, R emarks. Bida* Divided from Qal'at-al- 'Askar by Murqab-al- Gharbi. The oldest of the quarters, said to have been founded by Sudan refugees from Abu Dhabi ; it is a compact settlement of some 150 houses and is still tenanted chiefly by Sudan (80 houses), the remainder, of the inhabitants being A1 Bu Kuwarah (20 houses), 'Amamarah, Baqaqalah, Huwalah, Bani Yas and negroes. Rumailah % Separated from Bid a' by an interval of 200 or 300 yards: one mile beyond Rumailah is Ras-ash- Shuwa', a small cape which forms the north western limit of the town as Ras-an-Nisa'ah does the eastern. Contains about 100 houses, some of which are at present occupied by Khalifah, eldest son of Jasim, the A1 Thani Shaikh, and his retainers. The inhabitants are Ma^adhid, The genearl appearance of D5hah is unattractive ; the lanes are narrow and irregular, the houses dingy and small. There are no date palms or other trees, and the only garden is a small one near the fort, kept up by the Turkish garrison. Population and tribes. The inhabitants of Dohah are estimated to amount to about 12,000 souls. The population may be distributed as follows by tribes or classes ;— Name of tribe. Number of souls. Where located. 'Ali (Al Bin-) 1,750 In the Al Bin- 'Ali and D5hah quar ters. 'Amamarah .. 100 Scattered through the town. Arabs from Najd 250 In the Dohah quarter, on the inland side.

Sulutah 3,250 In the Sulutah and Murqab-ash-Sharqi quarters. Yas (Bani) of the Al Bu Falasah section. 50 Scattered through the town, especially in the Bida' quarter. Besides the above a few families of Sadah are found. There were formerly a few British Indians at Dohah of whom two or three were permanent settlers ; but their occupations, in consequence of the A1 Thani Shaikhs having entered personally on the business of pearl merchants, ceased to be profitable and aU of them have now taken their departure. The people of D5hah are, as a general rule, unhealthy in appearance—a circumstances which is attributed to their assiduity in pearl-diving, this being a form of emplovment which places a severe strain on the human constitution. Occupations, shipping and trade.—The Baharinah are blacksmiths, coppersmiths, and petty pearl-dealers ; the other tribes live by pearl-diving, sea-fishing and a small maritime carrying trade. About 350 pearl-boats, 60 sea-going boats running to 'Oman, the Persian coast and Basrah, and 90 fishing boats are owned at Dohah. Pearls are the only export; and the imports resemble those of the coast towns of Trucial 'Oman. Foreign trade is chiefly with Bahrain and, in a lesser degree, with Lingeh. Dohah is naturally the chief market town of the Bedouins of the Qatar peninsula. Supplies, water and transport. —Little can be obtained locally in the shape of supplies. Firewood is brought from the interior and from Clarence Strait. Dohah itself possesses only one well of brackish water, named 'Ain Walad Sa'id which is half a mile to the south of the D5hah quarter ; but there is a group of others called Mushairib, with fairly good water, at 1 mile to the west of the Dohah quarter. Three miles further inland is Bir-al-Jadidah, a large masonry well of indifferent water on which the town mainly depends for its supply. A mile beyond to the southwards are the wells of Na'aijah, from which the Shaikhs of the A1 Thani, the other notables of Dohah town and the officers of the Turkish garrison obtain their drinking water. The best of the Na'aijah wells is called 'Asailah. The Turkish troops obtain most of their water from Mushairib, where there is a military outpost of 8 men in a tower to watch the wells. The soldiers have now a vegetable garden at this place; and scurvy, which was formerly common among the garrison, has disappeared. About 150 horses and 800 camels are kept at D5hah. Political position. —Dohah may be regarded as in most respects the capital of Qatar and its place in the political system will be apparent from the general article on Qatar. Jasim-bin-Thani, the most influential Shaikh of the promontory, avoids residing in the r566 DOH-DOR place. The town is at present ruled 'by Jasim's fourth son 'Abdullah, he being recognised as Shaikh of Dohah — {Oa'elteer DOHAH— See Masqat (District).

To describe fully and with correctness this, the lower course of the Euphrates is at present impossible. The survey made in 1836 of the river below Samawah and fho survey dated 1860-65 of the portion between Khan Maqdam and Samawah are now antiquated, and reliable detailed information about the changes that have taken place in recent years is not, when it relates to the more inaccessible reaches of the river easv to procure. So far, however, as these difficulties permit we shall endeavour to describe the Euphrates,—first in its general and topographical aspects, and then with rHWpt^ to navigation and irrigation. General course and character.—The principal points that mark the lines of the Eunhratpq in its lower course are the towns of Musaiyib, Hillah, Diwaniyah, Samawah Nasinyah and Suq-ash-Shuyukh, by which it passes. This part of the river mav be divided into three sections; an upper section from Fallujah to Musaivib a central section from Musaiyib to Samawah and a lower section from Samawah to QCirnah The following are the principal points, in descending order, and the character of the, river m the first of these divisions ;— Name.

The rive*, which is spanned here by a bridge of 25 boats and divided into 2 channels by an is land, flows with a breadth of 240 yards and a maximum depth (in November) of about 25 feet. The Euphrates has a width at this place of about 190 yards. The banks here rise about 10 feet above the level of the river.574 EUPHRATES Name.

See article Musaiyib R emarks. The Khan at Sikan- dariyah on the Baghdad -K a r b a 1 a road is visible from this place. From Imam Ibrahim- al-Khalil the land on both sides of the river is cultivated and there are many gardens, walled and unwalled, of dates* orangey pomegra nates and figs. At Musaiyib the river is 180 yards broad and is crossed by a bridge of 24 boats. In the low season the banks, which here consist of alluvial sand of varying fineness with no cohesion, are S to 14 feet above the level of the stream* the extreme depth is 14 feet and the current flows about 1,500 yards an hour. In the flood season the river rises 10 feet and the current increases to 4 miles an hour. There is a consider able island in the river about 1| miles above Musaiyib and a similar one about 1 mile below ; both are suitable places for bridging operations and date timber in plenty is available near the former.(ai EUPHRATES 575 In this section, 68 miles in length, the Euphrates flows'through a dry but arable country ; its bed is broad and open, and the current is ordinarily slight. In the table above reference has not been made to some small canals which take oft: on the bank ; they will be mentioned in the paragraph on irrigation below. After passing through the town of Musaiyib the Euphrates runs for two miles and then throws off from its right bank the important Husainlyah canal; just below this point a former loop of the river, called the Shatt-al-Atiq or Old River, takes its departure on the opposite side ; this branch is now altogether dry. Three miles lelow the head of the Husainiyah canal the river reaches a crucial point in its career, and its v/aters divide into two streams which separate at an acute angle ; that to the west or right is the great Hindiyah canal; the other — here known as the Shatt-al-Hillah—is the one which we shall follow, for it is the true Euphrates of the last thousand years, though its stream is now thin and sluggish. About a mile below the bifurcation of the Hindiyah canal and the Euphrates, the Shatt-al-Atiq already mentioned rejoins the Euphrates from the left • most of the land enclosed between the Euphrates and the Shatt-al-'Atlq now belongs to the Dairat-as-Saniyah.

For 2J months in summer the Eu phrates at Hillah and in the reach above it is quite dry, and the boat bridge of 15 pontoons at Hillah settles down upon the sand. In winter, after rain, the stream at Hillah is 60 yards broad and less than four feet deep. For about 20 miles below Hillah there are date groves and many villages: one of the latter called Imam Hamzah (I) is not to be confound ed with the village of the same name below. The palms then cease and for 10 miles the country has a less cultivated and prosperous appear ance. Towards the end of latter stretch are numerous forti fied hamlets, 200 to 300 yards apart. Then follow 5 miles of still more desolate country, where many of the hamlets are now deserted and where the fighting towers are beginning to show symptoms of decay. The villages on the right bank belong to the Wisa- mah tribe and one of them, called Shukri, marks the boun dary between the two main sectionsEUPHRATES 577 Name.

In summer some dis- neeted pools are all that remains of the river in the reach be tween Hillah and the head of the Dagharah, they are sometimes crowd ed with fish which either are caught with nets by the Arabs or die as the water evaporates. The strecth from Diwanlyah to Imam Hamzah (II) is dry in summer, and in that season it is almost deserted by the inhabitants who migrate west wards towards the Hindiyah canal to find water for their catlle.

Here, as in the immediately preced ing reaches, the river •—except in winter—- has virtually ceased to flow; but 5 or 6 miles above Sama- wah its channel is joined by the 'At- shan coming from the Bahr-an-Najaf, which gives back to it, so far as not ex pended or absorbed, the water taken out by the Hindi- yah canal above Hillah. The first half of the way from Imam Hamzah (II) to Samawah is desert and the towers and houses which still stud the banks of the river, are now all unoccu pied ; but after Abu Juwarir, a mud vil lage of about 80 houses situated on the right bank 14 miles by road from Imam Hamzah (II), the country im proves and possess es both cultivation and inhabitants.

A short way above Abu Juwarir is the small village, also on the right bank, of Saiyid Abu Tabakh and a little below Abu Juwarir, on both banks, is the half-deserted town or settlement Rumai- thah to which a separate artile is devoted. At Sama wah there is a boat bridge. In this, as in the first section, some canals have been omitted which are dealt with further on in the paragraph on irrigation. Except in the first, 5, and again in the last 5 miles of this sectin the bed of the Eu phrates is for practical purposes dry during a great part of the year ; indeed for months in summer it is altogether empty, and even in winter it only carries one-thirty-fifth part of the water of the river. The total length of the section, waterless at times with the exception of 10 miles, is about 150 miles. The place of the Euphrates in this part of the country is taken by the Shatt-al-Hindlyah, which opens into the river at both ends and draws off nearly all the water at the head of the reach to restore a portion of it again at the tail. The causes of the supersession of the river by the canal.—a process which does not appear to have been foreseen in 1836 and which may have begun but was not, apparently, far advanced in 1860-65,—are partly natural and partly artificial. The chief factor was probably a gradual rise in the level of the river bed about Hillah by a natrual deposition of silt; and examintion has shown that in the neighbourhood of Hillah the loss of depth amounts in places to as much as 12 feet. A second influence came into operation with the opening of the Hindiyah canal, by which the volume and velocity of the Euphrates stream were reduced and its scour was diminished. A barrage constructed by the Turkish Government about 1890 at the head of the Hindiyah canal partically remedied the evil for a time; but in July 1903 this work gave way and the injury was aggravated, for the whole Euphrates now began to pour down the Hindiyah channel. Since this event occurred the silting up of the old Euphrates bed below the take-off of the Hindiyah has been accelerated by dams or Sukur which the Arabs build in it, especially below Hillah, for the purpose of flooding their lands and by the wasteful manner in which they withdraw water from the river, particularly by means of the Dagharah canal, without returning the surplus. Sand also carried by the wind from the adjoning desert is now doing its part, in choking up the ancient channel; and in places the accumulations due to this cause have attained a depth of 2| feet. It is interesting to observe that these changes consitute a return to the conditions of 1,000 years ago, when the main stream of the Euphrates flowed—as it has again begun to do—by and when the channel on which town subsequentlv grew up was a canal known as the Suran. The move of the Euphrates into the Hillah channel appears to have taken place gradually between the 8th and the 12th centuries A.D. 4E2 r580 EUPHRATES The principal features of the river in its third and last section, about 165 miles in length, are given in the table below which is a continuation of the last preceding one :— Name.

On the left bank about 18 miles below Samawah Town and 7 miles above Durraji is Khidhar, a village of about 100 mud houses, named after a small shrine which it pos sesses ; the inhabit ants are cultivat ors, boatmen and traders and mostly belong to the A1 Bu Muhsin tribe. The Mudirofthe Durraji Nahiyah of the Samawah Qadha has his residence at Khidhar. On or near the right bank of the Euphrates a little way above Durraji is 'Ain Said, a locality in the desert inland of which salt is obtained. Below Samawah the Euphrates flows in a turbid stream, vary ing from 60 to 120 yards in width, be tween banks which in the low season are 7 to 14 feet high. Near the river on either side are culti vated fields with the desert and scrub jungle beyond. The reach below Dur raji is similar to the one above it; but the river widens as it advances, and at Nasiriyah, 4 miles be low which the west ernmost branch of the Shatt-al-GharafEUPHEATES 581 Name.

There is a boat bridge at Nasiri- yah of 25 pontoons. The celebrated an cient ruins of Muqaiyar are situat ed on a slight emi nence, to the south of the river, about 6 miles south-west of Nasiriyah. The left bank between Nasiriyah and Su q-ash-Shuyukh is a swamp, formed by the spreading out and commingling of the Shatt-al-Gharaf and the Euphrates. At Suq-ash- Shuyukh the river proper cannot be very broad as the bridge contains only a dozen boats. About 6 miles south ward of Suq-ash-Shu- yukh is the village of Khamisiyah. Three creeks which lead from the river to Khamisiyah unite at that place and the canal formed by their junction is said to connect with the Shatt-al-'Arab just above MargiL In the reach from Suq-ash-Shuyukh to Madinah the Eu phrates runs through marshes notorious for their extent.

A large stretch of the marshes below this point is known as Birkat - al-Hammar. Below Ham mar again, on the same bank, is Jazair or Kibaish, a consider able place inhabited by Bani Asad. The breadth of the Eu- prates from Suq-ash- Shuyukh to Madinah and thence to Qur- nah is described as on the average about 150 yards. In the swamps above Madi nah the depth is sometimes only 2 J feet. Near Ma i- nah there are great marshes on the south side of river parttly known as Hor-aal- Jazair which com municate with the Shatt-al-'Arab by backwaters and from which also, in floods, Euphrates water finds its way down to the hollow between Basrah and Zubair towns.

To the east of Baghdad tLTwness oUhe584 EUPHRATEb left bank of the Euphrates is a serious but remediable defect; when it rises it lets loose destructive floods which sometimes sweep across Mesopotamia almost to the Tigris, and one of the first steps in the reclamation of Mesopotamia would be the prevention of such occurrences. Between Fallujah and Khan Maqdam attempts have already been made to confine the river by means of earth embankments about 8 feet high and 20 feet wide which are revetted on the side towards the stream. The river is at its highest in April and at its lowest in September: the following dia gram will explain the character of its ordinary rise and fall:— Height in metres above lowest level. The rise in spring is due to the melting of the winter snows in Armenia, and the sudden rise in November followed by a temporary decrease in December and January is attri butable to the autumn rains, of which the effect is suddenly checked by winter frosts. The maximum annual rise of the Euphrates, which does not last long enough to appear in our diagram, is about 5 metres. If the restoration of irrigation in Mesopotamia were to be seriously undertaken the operations would probably be begun on the part of the Euphrates between Fallujah and Dlwaniyah ; some of the more important existing canals in this quarter consequently must be noticed here. The first of these is the Saqlawiyah, which used to take out some 8 miles above Fallujah and, passing to the north of the ruins of 'Aqar Nimrud, formed an extensive lake on the west side of Kadhimain Town and then entered the Tigris about 5 miles below Baghdad. In July 1838 the British surveying steamer Euphrates passed through this canal and met with no soundings of less than 6 feet; but since then the canal has been closed, on account of the floods which it assisted on their Way towards Baghdad. The upper end is now blocked by wheat fields, while the lower is filled for a short distance by a back-flow from the Tigris, and forms a creek, known as the Khar, which is spanned by an iron bridge at a short distance from Baghdad on the route to Musaiyib. The following is a list of the existing canals from Fallujah to Hillah with their discharges as registered on the 3rd January 1905 when the Euphrates at Fallujah was 1J metres above its lowest level and was itself discharging 700 cubic metres per second ;— Discharge on 3rd Name and description of canal.

The Abu Ghuraib has a good regulating-head of masonry consisting of two spans each 2| metres wide and probably identical with the bridge described above : but the regulators of the remainder are indifferent. As will be seen the aggregate discharge of these canals with a rather low river is only 16 cubic metres a second; this rcught rise it time of flood to about 200 cubic metres per second, but the result would be flooding, owing to imperfect subsidiary arrangements, of the whole country ; and cultivators in the present state of affairs prefer not to irrigate their lands at all when the river is high.

The Dagharah itself, on the left bank, is separately dealt with elsewhere. It only remains to mention the Abul Fadhal, a canal thrown off by the Euphrates from its left bank some 2 miles above Diwaniyah and swallowed up in the marshes to the south- eastwards which contain the village of Fawwar, distant about 30 miles from Dlwanivah Note on the Floods of the Euphrates and Tigris. 1. From an examination Of the few data available there appears to a connection between the rise and fall of the Euphrates and Tigris during November and December and also to a lesser extent in January and February. The correlation is not close but on the average the changes are simultaneous on the two rivers at Hit and Baghdad respectively while at Nasmyah on the Euphrates they occur on the average six days rten +n fT ^ 011 ^ After the have risen to flood level early in April, all correlation appears to cease and no useful forecast; , r pts ^floor of the Euprates from obse - ations - ^ ^ ^ t i?'..

It is almost certain that the main flood is caused by the melting of the snow in the Caucasus. On this main flood there are marked irregularities which are probably due to varying weather conditions in the Caucasus. Without access to j records of the weather in the latter region during years for which flood data are available it is impossible to be certain what weather conditions are necessary to produce an in creased flow. From general consideration one would say that rain or warm southerly winds would be an efficient cause, and as both these are associated with depressions moving from the Mediterranean eastwards, the only hope of a useful forecast is to know when such a depression exists, and this information can be given only by the Egyptian weather Bureau. 3. Although local conditions do not affect the two rivers directly, they may indicate the kind of weather obtaining at the time in question in the Caucasus and presumably southerly winds in Mesopotamia are indicative of flood-producing conditions in the Caucasus. If this assumption is well founded one would expect the rivers to continue rising so long as southerly winds prevail over Mesopotamia. In any case no appreci able fall in the rivers is likely to occur until some time after northerly winds have been estabished over Mesopotamia. In the present year (1916) southerly winds are unusually prolonged, the general air-drift from the 1st to 14th April having been continually from one direction between south of East. , ELPHINSTONE INLET— 8ee Khor-asb-iSbam.v~- / FAD—FAD 587 FADAGHAH— See 'Iraq ; rural tribes.

FAILAKAH (I sland)— To British mariners formerly known as ' Pheleechi, ,, from the local pronunciation which is Failachah, An island, 7 miles in length with a maximum breadth of 3 miles, lying on the north side of the entrance to Kuwait Bay: its western end, the nearest to Kuwait Town is about 10 miles east-north-east of Ras-al-Ardh, while its northern end is about 7 miles south-east of the mouth of Khor-as-Sabiyah. Physical characteristics and surroundings, —The shape of Failakah is that of a badly- shaped wedge, having its point to the south-east and its base to the north-west. The island stands on an extensive flat of mud and sand with rocky patches, which is called Dharub and stretches south-eastwards from the entrance of Khor-as-Sabiyah. Failakah is low, the highest point being a mound 30 feet high in the westernmost part; at high spring tides it is broken in upon by the sea, and, not being visible more than 6 or 8 miles, it is frequently not sighted in entering Kuwait Bay. Failakah has two outliers : 'Auhah, a small sandy islet about 3 miles from its south-eastern extremity at the place where the Dharub flat comes to an end, and Mashjan, a low sandy islet on the flat about 2 miles from Failakah in the direction of Khor-as-Sabiyah. Inhabitants, —Estimates of the population of Failakah vary ; but there appear to be about 200 men or, say, 500 souls altogether. There is now only one village, Zor, on the north-west coast facing Mashjan ; a Niqa'ah or boat-harbour, difficult of entrance is situated on the shore three-quarters of a mile to the north-east of the village. Landing at Zor is easy. The place possesses some 70 or 80 ordinary boats, smaller on the aver age than the boats of Kuwait Town, and over 20 Wahriyahs or fishing-boats built of jarids or date-branches. There are several deserted villages on the island. One of these, named Subaihiyah, situated on the western shore nearer to the southern than to the northern end of the island. It is marked by a group of 90 superannuated palms, perforated by insects. Close to Zor, beyond its boat-harbour, is the deserted site of Sa'idi; about a mile further is a similar place called Dasht; finally, in this direction, we reach Qrainiyah where there is a house built by Shaikh Jabir during his father's lifetime ; this is now, except Zor, the only inhabited place on the island. The people of Zor, mostly fishermen but a few of them pearl divers, are of mixed origin: the majority are said to have come from the island of Kharag, but others are from Fao, the Hindiyan District and even 'Oman. They are civil and well-disposed, but super stitious and fanciful, and their condition generally is wretched. Indeed the aspect of the island from every point of view is one of melancholy but gentle decay. Water supply. —Water is found in most parts of the island at a depth of only 6 feet: it is said to be better than the water of Kuwait Town and to be less brackish near the sea than it is at some distance inland. In the hot weather it turns so salt in some places aa to kill lucerne. Fisheries and agriculture. —The resources of Failakah are fisheries and agriculture on a modest scale. After deduction of Makalah, or the food expenses of the crew, the catch of fish is divided into equal shares, of which one goes to the Shaikh of the island, one to the owner of the boat, one to the Captain, and one to each of the crew. Wheat and barley are grown with some success on clayey patches. About 6,000 lbs. of wheat are said to be sown annually in the whole island, and the total yield of grain is about 30 tons. The produce after deduction of taxes, when taxes are paid, is divided equally between the cultivators on the one hand and the suppliers of seed, plough- animals and food for the animals on the other: the crop is sown in October and reaped in April. Melons are grown, also lucerne and some of the ordinary vegetables such as onions, carrots and radishes. There are a few rose trees and some dates ; but the latter, which are chiefly towards the south end of the island, are not in a flourishing condition, and the agriculture of Failakah generally is inferior to that to Jahrah. The sidar or2rx FAI-FAI 591 ber and the tamarisk are the principal trees other than dates, but hardy as they are they do not grow without attention. Domestic and other animals. —Failakah boasts a dozen camels, a number of donkeys, a few flocks and herds, and some poultry. Flamingoes, pelicans, gulls and flocks of a bird resembling the curlew haunt the shore and the island is said to be visited in the hot weather by large flocks of sand-grouse. There are a number of gazelles, descended from a pair which a member of the Shaikh of Kuwait's family turned loose some years ago : only relations of the chief are permitted to shoot them. Administration. —Failakah is governed (1904) on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait, to whom it belongs, by one of his relations. This individual, Sa'ud Qalatah, who is a man of about 35 with some negro blood and partially paralysed in his lower limbs, succeeded his father in the governorship. About one-third of the arable land on Failakah is held mu'af or revenue-free: the remainder pays zakat to the Shaikh of Kuwait at the rate of one-tenth of gross produce, besides which the Shaikh takes for himself all the straw of the island, even on revenue-free holdings, except a small quantity that the inhabitants are allowed to retain for their own necessities. The Shaikh has declined to allow rich merchants of Kuwait or foreigners to settle in Failakah on the ground that they would probably oppress the original inhabitants. Sacred places. —Failakah is remarkable chiefly for its tombs and shrines. First, there are the graves of the auliya or saints, who •play a large part in the traditions of the island ; of these some 60 or 70 are scattered round the village of Zor. Then, about a mile to the south of Zor, there are the tombs of Sa'ad, Sa'id, and Sa'idah ; that of Sa'ad is to the east of the others, and the whole group stand up conspicuously as Failakah is ap proached in a boat from Kuwait. It is principally to visit these tombs, said to com memorate two brothers and a sister who were murdered here, that piligrims from Yemen and India, and more frequently from Afghanistan and Baluchistan, visit Failakah. There is another tomb, also possessing virtue and visited by pilgrims ; it is said to be that of a certain Muhammad-al-Badawi, whose only claim to distinction is that his finger after death resisted the removal of his signet ring. Lastly, there is the Muqam-al- Khidhar, which overlooks the boat harbour of Zor, and is now a roofless tower threatened by the encroachments of the sea. Persians do not resort to it, but it is frequented by Arab sailors who come to perform their vows, made in sickness or in danger at sea, by sacrificing a sheep or a goat, by burning incense and by feeding the poor. The tutelary spirit is probably the same Khidhar who has a shrine on ' Abbadan island ; in Failakah, however, his reputation is chiefly as a patron saint of mariners. The shrine of Khidhar is not so much visted by foreign pilgrims as those mentioned before it. Traditions. —Qrainiyah is said to have been the seat of a tyrant who wore golden boots: his city was destroyed by God because he cut a child in half to prove the temper of his sword. There is a local tradition, supported by traces of good stone houses in the middle of the island, that the Portuguese once occupied the place. They are said to have been driven, first from Dasht and then from the centre of the island to which they retired by a plague of rats sent upon them by the Auliya.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) FAILI YAH— Kurds belonging to the Faili sect; see Kurd tribe. FAILIYEH— A village in the Muhammareh District of Southern'Arabistan ; it is situated on the left bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab, 3 miles above Muhammareh Town, between the Shatt-al- 'Arab, and the right bank of the Abu Jidi' canal. It consists of about 300 brick, mud, and reed houses, with 12 or 15 general shops and two coffee shops : the inhabitants are Muhaisin and mixed Arabs, Baluchis, and negroes. Failiyeh is the head-quarters of the Shaikh of Muhammareh's administration ; here are the offices of his Government, and here is quartered his mercenary force of about 400 armed Arabs and Baluchis. A small quay of date logs occupies the angle between the river and the canal, and about a mile up the Abu Jidi' is a small dock in which the Shaikh's steamers are repaired. The Shaikh has at Failiyeh about 20 brass and iron muzzle-loading guns, and his saluting battery stand just below the entrance to the canal: below the battery is an orchard and young date grove. Failiyeh is connected with Muhammareh Town by a private telephone belonging r592 FAI-FAJ to the Shaikh. The principal buildings are two places which are still occupied by part of the household of the Shaikh, but Khaz'al Khan now resides in an imposing new mansion called Qasr Khaz'aliyeh, three-quarters of a mile further up the bank of the Shatt'al-Arab ; his Persian wife, the Jamil-as-Saltaneh, also has her abode there. Pailiyeh was founded about 1860 by Haji Jabir, the first great Shaikh of the Muhaisin.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) FAIS (M arsa-al)— A small creek about a mile north-eastward of Has Zabld on the coast of Yemen, south western Arabia. It forms the mouth of Wadi Zabid {q. v.), and is used by slave dhows for landing their cargoes. The rushes and reeds growing about its mouth are easily dis tinguishable from the anchorage off it, in 4J fathoms.

FAJAR— A well situated in a small valley of the same name occurring in the midst of the barren desert which stretches between Tabuk, on the west, the Nafud, on the east y Jabal Tabaik, on the north, and the Taima oasis on the south. The well, which contains good water, lies east by north of Tabuk, and at a distance from it of nearly 70 miles, and about 90 miles north-west by north from Taima. It is surrounded by rough country, and differs in this respect from the location of the other wells in these parts, except that of Hausa. On this account it is difficult to recognise and dangerous to approach; and it was at these two wells that raiding parties nearly accounted for Car- ruthers in 1909. The Ruwalah and Shararat roam over the surrounding waste. Wadi Fajar trends east-north-eastwards and does not appear to be of any great length.. • {Carruthers, 1909.) FAJAR (W adi)— J See Fajar.

Khor Fakkan stands on the southern shore of a sandy bay two miles wide, one mile deep and open to the north east : the bay has a perfectly sheltered boat harbour at its east end and just outside its eastern point is an island 240 feet high known as Sirat-al-Khor. The water supply of the village is good and the date plantations contain about 5,000 trees • fish, vegetables cattle and poultry are procurable. There are about 150 houses of Naqbiyin and Arabi- cised Persians, and the population may amount to 800 souls. The people live by their dates, by cultivation of wheat and by pearl diving; they own four or five coasting vessels which run to Masqat Town and to places in the Persian Gulf. There are seven shops The place is at present held in fief by Sa'id-bin-Ahmad, a first cousin once removed of the present Shaikh of Sharjah.

FALAIJ (J abal)— An isolated group of low hills which lies some 25 miles to the north-west of 'Ibri, in Dhahirah (q-v.) t 'Oman Sultanate. FALAIJ (W adi)— A valley in the eastern Ha jar district of the 'Oman Sultanate, through which runs the main line of communication between the coast at Sur and the island districts of Ja'alan and Sharqiyah; its direction is south-south-west and north-north-east, and it reaches the sea slightly to the west of Sur. Wadi Fisao, the principal tributary of Wadi Falaij, rises on the eastern side of a pass in Jabal Khamis about 20 miles south-south-east of Siir, and about 1 mile below the pass opens out into a stony plain called Ma'qal which is surrounded by hills and ravines and in which are some of the coal exposures referred to in the article on Jabal Khamis. Be douin encampments are sometimes found in this vicinity. About eight miles below Ma'qal, Wadi Fisao joins Wadi Falaij, of which the upper portion has not been described i by any European traveller, from the right bank. In the foot-hills of Jabal Khamis, to • the east or north-east of this junction, is a Masharifah village, of about 60 houses, called i Ghassah, which is distinguished by a tower and is said to possess 20 camels, 20 donkeys, 30 cattle, 600 sheep and goats and 800 palms ; and in the bed of the Wadi itself, below the junction, is the oasis of Falaij with date palms, oleanders and other trees,, good and ample water, abundant camel-grazing and evidences of former cultivation extending for about a mile; Bedouins belonging to the Masharifah or to the Rawajih section of the Bani Bu Hasan frequently encamp here, but there are no permanent habitations. Four and-a-half miles below the oasis of Falaij, on the right bank of the Wadi, is the tower of Rafsah ; it is said to have been built by an Imam of 'Oman to resist the incursions of the Wahhabis, but it is now in the hands of the Masharifah tribe who oblige all caravans using this route to pass through a square gate-house 100 yards from the tower and pay toll, in consideration of which they do not plunder them. The tower itself is a quaint erection 50 feet by 30 feet in diameter and it completely commands the passage up the wldi which at this is narrow. On the left bank of the Wadi, opposite the tower, are cave dwellings containing some eight or ten families of Masharifah, who possess 3 camels, 40 donkeys, 8 cattle and 200 goats. This is the frontier village of the tribe in the direc tion of Sur. About two miles below Rafsah, Wadi Falaij is joined from the west by a ravine with conspicuous yellow sandstone cliffs, two or three miles up which lies the Masharifah village of Mislaq. The people of Mislaq are wood-cutters and carriers ; they own 8 camels, 16 donkeys, 12 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. One mile further on Wadi Falaij debouches from the hills and, leaving Suq Sur on its right bank, tends north eastwards to the coast. The total fixed population of the valley and its affluents appears to be only about 500 souls. The valley of Wadi Falaij varies greatly in breadth ; at Rafsah it is only a few hundred yards broad, while further up it exceeds two miles; the actual bed of the wddi is generally 200 to 300 yards across and is enclosed between banks 20 or 30 feet high. From the oasis of Falaij downwards the wadi contains a limpid, running stream, which has frequently to be crossed in ascending or descending the valley and is in places two feet deep. The road generally runs in the bed of the stream, but at Rafsah it ascends to the level of the Masharifah tower by a steep zigzag path.— (Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.)

When seen from the westward it appears as a bluff cape, but on near approach a low point is seen to project from it rather more than a mile, from which a reef of rocks, some above water and steep to, extends south- eastward about 2 cables ; on each side of the point a bay is formed. The summit of the bluff 2 sea miles westward of Ras Falanj is 1,505 feet above the sea, and from it the high land continues in a north easterly direction, attaining a height at Ras Momi, of 1,920 feet, from whence the land falls to a mod-rately high mountain of granite, then to several small hillocks of the same formation, finally terminating in the low rocky point Ras Darishah. Ras Falanj forms the western horn of Bandar Ausal. {Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot, 1909.)

FALLUJAH— A village in 'Iraq on the left bank of the Euphrates, nearly 70 miles by water above the town of Musaiyib ; it is surrounded by cultivation, but there are not many dates. The Abu Ghuraib canal still takes off from the Euphrates about 4 miles below Fallujah, and the Saqlawiyah used to take off about Smiles above it: both are noticed in the article on the river. At Fallujah the Euphrates is spanned by a boat bridge, 227 yards long, carrying a roadway 10 feet in width ; the bridge is divided into two parts by an island and consists altogether of 25 boats, each of which is 30 feet long, 11 feet broad and 5 feet deep: this bridge is at present in poor repair and has practically no handraiL The inhabitants number about 600 souls : their houses are built of sun-dried bricks. An isolated house, the property of Kadhim Pasha, brother-in-law of the present Sultan of Turkey and formerly political detenu at Baghdad, stands on the right bank of the Euphrates opposite to Fallujah, near the further end of the bridge. In Fallujah village proper are_a mosque, two or three Khans, and a bazaar of about 30 shops. There Is also a Sarai built by the Turkish Government, for Fallujah was the headquarters of a Nahiyah similarly named in the Qadha of Dilaim and was consequently the seat of a Mudir. The place is on the Baghdad-Aleppo telegraph line, being the station intermediate betweenFAL—FAO 597 the offices at Kadhimain Town and Rumadlyah: the connection is double in either direction.

Authority, —Most of the information contained in this article is derived from an elaborate report by Mr. W. D. Gumming of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, Fao. A civil station, containing the Fao telegraph office, is situated between the adjacent creeks of Haji 'Abdullah and Haji Rashid and a fort between the creeks Bu Saiyid and Mulla 'Isa : there are thus 22 creeks in Fao above the civil station, 21 between it and the fort, and 6 below the fort. From the above table it will be apparent that the fixed population of Fao, exclusive of the civil station and fort which are dealt with further on, amounts to about 1,700 souls, and thas it consists of very heterogeneous elements. Agriculture of the Fdo tract. —^Agriculture is almost confined to the growing of dates; the groves generally begin between 200 and 800 yards from the water's edge, but the clear space between is also being planted with palms and in places the trees already come down to the bank. The present number of palms in the whole tract is estimated at 10,000. The date palms of Fao have a luxuriant growth, but most of them yield the inferior qualities of fruit known as Sair which are exported in baskets to Asiatic countries ; some of the better sort, however, are now bought up by Basrah dealers for export in boxes to Europe and America. A little wheat and barley is produced for local consumption ; and a small quantity of vegetables is raised by the people, both in summer and winter, for their own use. The cultivators do not keep livestock on the same scale as the inhabitants of 'Abbadan island on tlje other side of the Shatt-al-'Arab, but they own some cattle and a very lew601 sheep ; for these some lucerne is cultivated, but their pasture consists chiefly of the grass that grows everywhere on the banks of the Shatt-al-'Arab. In recent years reclamation of land from the river and the sea has been undertaken by the Shaikh of Kuwait who is owner of all the land in Fao. By means of sadds or embankments a quantity of arable land has been added below the fort both on the bank of the river and on the side towards the sea, but not in* the direction of Khor 'Abdullah ; and at another place the Shaikh has endeavoured to check erosion of the river bank by causing large Ballams filled with earth to be sunk close in shore. Creek No. 49 is a new one and is called after the land-agent of the late Shaikh of Kuwait. Shaikh Mubarak is also preparing to cultivate a new strip of land on the side next to the desert; it extends with a breadth of 600 yards from the civil station to the Hadd creek, a distance of 5 miles ; at present this plot is saline and produces nothing. Climate. —The year at Fao may be divided into seasons as follows :— Winter—December, January and February. Spring—-March, April and May. Summer—June, July, August and September. Autumn—October and November. This distribution of months being taken as a basis, the highest and lowest temperatures recorded (in degreess Fahrenheit) since observations began to be taken have been:— Highest Lowest Season, temperature. temperature.

January and February are the wettest months; but rain may fall at any time between the middle of November and the middle of March, and in 1905 some rain was received in May. The total cold weather rainfall in 1904-05 was 3*65 inches, and in 1905-06 it was 1'63 inches. There are occasional showers at all seasons. During July and the first half of March north-west winds ordinarily prevail, with dry heat; ard from the middle of July to the end of September the atmosphere is damp as well as hot. In September and October there are frequently fogs at night and in the early morning. The civil station of Fdo. —The station of Fao covers the riverward end of the spit between the Haji Rashid creek (No. 22 above) and the creek of Haji 'Abdullah (No. 23 above) immediately below, and its frontage upon the river is about 600 yards. The telegraph offices—for the sake of which, chiefly, the station exists—are bituated on the southern bank of the Haji Rashid creek. A garden, lawn tennis couct and other appurtenances adjoin the old British quarter on the two landward sides, and there are 7 tanks of 400 gallons capacity each for storing water. On the south side of the old British compound, about equidistant from the two creeks and from the river, is an old Turkish Government building, which is a substantial single- storeyed brick structure of five rooms. A marsh lies behind the entire station, reaching practically from creek to creak and upon the river also there are two marshes. At the back of the inland marhs, at about C52(w)GSB 4 h602 FAQ—FAR 700 yards from the river date groves begin ; they extend for some hundreds of yards to the desert beyond. On the southern bank of the Haji Rashid creek, on the verge of the desert and about 1,000 yards from the river are the ruins of an old mud fort now used as a graveyard and planted with date palms. On the same bank of the same creek , but nearer the river and about the middle of the date plantations, is a mosque adjoined by one or two huts. The Fdo fort. —The Fao fort, of which the construction was commenced in 1886, stands about four miles below the station, between the creeks of Bu Sa'id (No. 43 above) and Mulla 'Isa (No. 44 above), of which the former runs along its north-western and the latter along its south-eastern side ; it is about 500 yards distant from the Shatt-al-'Arab proper, but at high tide the water of the river washes up to its walls. The plan of the fort is roughly rectangular and its main face is apparently that on the Mulla 'Isa creek which looks to the south-east and towards the mouth of the river; this front, which is faced with light-coloured stone and rises about 15 feet above the crest of the glacis, shows from the river as a white line against a drak background of the date plantations. The fort was never finished and never had any artillery armament. Political position. —Fao, as the key of the Shatt-al-'Arab and as the point where the cable of the Indo-European Telegraph Department meets the land line, is a place of international importance. The Shaikh of Kuwait has valuable interest at Fao inasmuch as the whole of the tract passed in 1904 to. the Shaikh in virtue of an amicable agreement by which the family estates on the banks of the Shatt-al-'Arab were partitioned among the various claimants. Communications. —At high water landing is easy everywhere in the neighbourhood of Fao ; but, when the tide is low, banks of mud that extend from 50 to 100 yards into the river are uncovered between the station and the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab, and the shore here becomes inconvenient (though not impossible) of approach. At the station the breadth of the mud flats is only about 20 yards and it gradually decreases to 10 yards at the head of the Fao tract. The difference between ordinary high and low tide is, at the station, about 10 feet. With a south-west wind blowing, the tide sometimes rises 20 feet and submerges the station along with the surrounding country. The course of the path in the Fao tract is determined by the creeks, the arrangement of which and of the villages upon them is extremely regular and symmetrical. A path follows the bank of each creek from the edge of the Shatt-al-'Arab up to the beginning of the desert; and there is also a pathway leading from the river to the desert up the centre of every spit between two adjacent creeks. Longitudinal communication is supplied by three roads or paths, all of which are roughly parallel to the river : of these, the one nearest to the river runs between the date plantations and the stream and is interrupted by every creek which it encounters; the second, which is the most shady and frequented, con nects the village on each creek with the villages upon the creeks adjoining it on either side and its course is consequently not very straight, but upon this route every creek is bridged by a single date log thrown across it; the third route lies along the edge of the desert behind the date plantations and is not interrupted by the creeks. {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.)

The settled population of the valley down to and including Mansur is thus approxi mately 25,000 souls. There is also a ruined village called Munaqi near Wushail, half of which belonged to the Government of the 'Oman Sultanate and half to the inhabitants of Wushail; it has about 12 wells, one of which is very large and is still used for irrigation. Another village now deserted was Ha jar, about 2 miles south of Jammah ; it was held by the Bani Harraa and Siyabin. The trade of Wadi Fara' is with Masn'ah. The name Rustaq is of uncertain appli cation ; it is sometimes used to designate particularly the fortified village of Qal'at Kasra, which is the capital of the valley, but more generally it refers to the whole aggregate of villages from Hazam inclusive upwards. All Rustaq, in the latter sense, is in the pos session of Saiyid Sa'id bin-Ibrahim-bin-Qais-bin-'Azzaa, who receives an allowance of $200 a month from the Sultan of Masqat and has given him his sister in marriage.—• {Qazetter of the Persian Gulf.)FAR—FAR 609 FAR 1 A (WA di)— An important but little known valley in Hejaz, western Arabia, which appears to have its origin on the north-western slopes of the Dharlbah watershed. From there it trends in a northerly direction for about 140 miles to a point a few miles eastward of Jadid, on the usual Hajj route between Yanbo' and Al-Madinah. Here the valley bends sharply to the west, and then assumes a general south-westerly direction to Marsa Sablr where it reaches the Read Sea. Amongst the more important tributaries of Wadi Far'a must be reckoned a valley having its source in the high-lands south-west of Al-Madinah, and which joins the main valley on its right bank near the point, referred to above, where Wadi Far'a bends sharply to the west. Another right-bank tributary joins in about 30 miles higher up. The following villages, given in descending order, are reported to occur in Wadi Far'a :—• Name. Bank. Position. R emarks.

Doughty says that Wadi Far'a is a long valley and that its inhabitants are principally Bani Salim, Bani 'Amr, and Al-'Ubbeda, the two latter being fendies of the Mosruh kindred of Bani Harb. He says that the Bani Salim villages between Al-Madinah and Yanbo' and in Wadi Far'a, are as follows:—Al-Jadaidah, Umm Theyan, Kaif, Al- Kissa, Al-Ab, Al-Hamra, Al-Khorma, Al-Wasita, Al-Hasaniyah, Al-Faera, Al-'Aliy, Jadid, Badr, and Jabal-al-Figgera.

These islands, which are the largest on the eastern side of the Red Sea, are situated to .the westward of Ras Turfa and Jaizan, on the main land of Arabia, and from them is named the vast bank extending a distance of about 320 miles, parallel with the coast. The Faiasan islands are between one quarter and one-third of this distance from the south-eastern end of the bank. They are two in number, but for all practical purposes form but one island being connected by a sandy spit so shallow that camels frequently pass from one island to the other. On the eastern side of this spit is Khor Hasayif opening to the north eastward, and on its western side, Khor Bakara opening to the north-westward. The south-western island is Farasan Kabir, 31 miles long north-west and south-east, and the north-eastern island is Farasan Saghir, 18 miles long and lying partly in the bight of the other. They are very irregular in shape, and will be best understood by consulting the chart, for although their united width is only 12 miles, from the irregularity of their form they measure 130 miles round their coast-line. In the Farasan islands there are hills of considerable height, interspersed with plains and valleys ; they are of coral rock, the most remarkable being Jabal Qasr, a tmall round hill eastward of Tibia bay on Farasan Kabir. To the south-east of Jabal Qasr is a bluff, which is wedge-shaped on some bearings, and, from the southward, shows as a hummock with a peak in the centre. The north-western part of Farasan KabTr is high and rocky, and the extreme headland is called Ras Farasan. Jabal Safah is high part of Farasan Saghir, and had a tree on its summit. Note. —All distances referred to in this article are in nautical mile. ii2612 MMSAN The following is a descriptive list of the principal features connected with the Farasan islands;— Khor Bakara. —East 5 miles from Has Farasan, is the north-western extreme of Farasan Saghir, with the small village of Keftib on its highest part. Between these points is the entrance of Khor Bakara, the inlet between the two Fara^ san islands which extends about 16 miles to the south-eastward. The approach to this khor is between Khaima island and Jazirat Disan, and is deep. In the inner part of the khor the depths are from 4 to 8 fathomsj but in the narrowest part, about 5 miles within the entrance, there appears to be only 3 fathoms. About 4J miles south-eastward from Ras Farasan is the vil a lage of Sayal, and just within the narrowest part of the khor on the western side, are two are three wells of good water, close to the beaeta Triangle island. —About 3 miles southwestward from R&amp;s Rasib, the iiOrthern extreme of Farasan Saghir, is a triangular island, standing on the southern edge of the bank extending westward from Ras Rasib to Khaima island. Jazirat Akhain.—A bank extends eastward from Farasan Saghir, including Sail Abadho within its limits, and from thence stretches away in a northwesterly direction for nearly 18 miles | it consists almost entirely of shoal Water and groups of small rocky islets; Jazirat Akbain, the largest of these, is a narrow strip half a mile wide and a mile long, with two small islets off its northern end and one on its eastern side. Bail Ahadho and Dhabik Island. —Sail Abadho is 7 miles South-eastward frOm Jazi s rat Akbain and Dhabik, 13J miles in a more southerly direction. Both are small round coral rocks from 10 to 20 feet high, and mushroom-shaped. They are sometimes called Pie Islands. Khor Saghir. —On the eastern side of FarasSn Saghir, is westward of Mandhakh island, and has its entrance along the northern side of that island. This is a good harbour, opening out from the entrance channel into a basin 2| miles long, east and west, by 1J miles wide, with depths from 9 to 12 fathoms, and perfectly sheltefed from all winds and Sea. There is a Small village and a grove of date trees on its Western and northern sides, in Which are many wells of good water. The houses are small and built of coral, but are mostly in ruins. No Supplies except water can be obtained, and this is said to be Scarce in the hot Season, Mandhakh Island. —-Separates IChOr Saghir from IChOr Hasayif. It is nearly 3 mile§ long ea§t and west, and one mile wide at its eastern end, but tapering towards the western end where it is only half mile wide. It is a high coral island standing On the northern edge of the Shore reef. Khor Hasyaif. —Southward of Mandhakh island is IChor Hasayif, receding about 8 miles into Farasan Kabir. The entrance is between the eastern end of Madhakh and the reef extending from Jabal Katah, on which are the two islets, Sail Sharra Saghir and Sail Sharra Kabir. The entrance is 3 cables wide abreast of the south-eastern point of Mandhakh, and, from thence in wards, opens out to a width of B or 7 cables, but it is tortuous. At 2J miles from the head, anchorage may b© found in 7 or 8 fathoms with good swinging room. Ahdulla Islands. —Jabal Abdulla is a small rocky island 9 miles eastward of Mandhakh island and surrounded by a group of smaller islets; it may be easily distinguished by a knot or remarkable bluff at its southern end. Maraba Island. —Jabal Maraba island is about 4 miles southward of Jabal Abdulla and near a projecting point of Farasan Kabir. It is about half a mile long, rocky, and the highest island in the neighbourhood. It has a flat top or hummock, is surrounded by a group of small low islands, and appears from the northward as if forming part of Farasan Kabir. Komari island and channel. —About midway between the south-eastern point of Farasan Kabk and Jibal Maraba island, and close to the former is Komari island. It lies on the western side of Komari channel through which vessels aiay pass to and from Jaizan,7 MMslN 613 tiafar islttnd.- —About 2 miles north-eastward from Komari island is Hafar, one of a cluster of small rocky islets on the edge of the rocky bank which forms the northern side of Komari channeL The Farasan bank is an extensive shoal and rocky bank^ the northern point of which is in latitude 20° 4/ N., and lies 12 miles westward of Lith» It continues, as far south* ward as Kamaran island, and including that island within its limits, is about 320 miles long in a general south-south-easterly direction from its northern extreme to the parallel of 18° N., it is encumbered with shallow patches, so that between these limits no Vessel should attempt to cross it.

FARTAK (R as)— A prominent headland in southern Arabia, affording a good landmark, and forming the south-western horn of the indentation, known as Qamar Bay, between the Dhufar district and the Mahrah coast. Ras Fartak is bold and safe to approach, there being 9 to 10 fathoms of water close to the cliffs, 20 and 30 fathoms at one mile, and 100 fathoms about 6 miles from the shore. It is a lofty, mountainous headland about 2,500 feet in height, and visible at a distance of 60 miles on a clear day. Next to Ras Sajar {Sakar, Seger) it is the highest and largest promontory on the coast. The sea-cliff, which at Khalfut, 12 miles to the northward, is about 60 feet above the sea level, increases rapidly in height with the land and soon arrives at a perpen dicular escarpment of 1,900 feet, a height which it maintains onwards to the summit of Ras Fartak. It is by far the grandest escarpment on the south-eastern coast of Arabia, being uninterruptedly perpendicular from top to bottom for an extent of 6 miles. No part of this range has any vegetation except near the summit, and that chiefly on the western side where the range slopes gradually to the plain below. Indeed, the barrenness of the Fartak range generally, as well as that of the country side, seems to indicate that this part of the coast does not catch the rains of the south-west monsoon. From the extreme of the cape the cliffs extend in a northerly direction for about 8 miles, then they become lower and less regular for a further distance of about 9 miles, when they end in the sandy beach off the village of Tabut, the rocky projections forming several small bays with deep water. When about 30 miles off Ras Fartak in a southerly direction it appears like an island with a gap in the middle. It is supposed to be the ancient Syagros, from its resem blance to a boar's head when seen at from 20 to 30 miles, either from west or east. The current, which begins to set east-north-eastward along the south-eastern coast of Arabia early in April, is apparently deflected at Ras Fartak, and strikes the coast about Damqut, in Qamar Bay. Its average strength is 2 miles an hour. During the north-east monsoon it runs in the opposite direction at 1 mile an hour.— {Bed Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot* 1909.)

FARUQ (W adi)— A long, narrow depression in eastern Arabia, apparently running north by west and south by east and divided from the Hasa oasis (to the east of it) by an interval of about 30 miles. The head of Wadi Faruq is in Summan at Judah, and it ends at the hilly ridge called Jau-ad-Dukhan, perhaps 30 or 40 miles short of Jabrln. Where the Riyadh- Al-Hasa route crosses it it is about one mile broad, and has a sandy bed with a steepish m w J622 FAR—FAS ascent on the east bank for about a mile. Wadi Faruq consists of a labyrinth of smal) sandhills, but it produces firewood which is brought in by Bedouins for sale at Hofuf. The valley is occupied in the autumn by the 'Ajman, and at times it is infested by raiding parties of the Al Morrah and Manasir.—(6W«eer of the Persian Gulf i ' Leachman, 1912.) FARZAH— A village in (Bat-ha) Farzah [q. v.). FARZAH (B at-ha)— t. According to Palgrave this place is a wooded hollow, amid high peaked granite hills situated in 'Oman to the south-westward of Sib. He describes it as being covered with verdure except in one part of the valley where a patch of clean sand is spread out over some extent. By the side of this he states there was a place bearing a striking resem blance to a chateau of Louis XIIl's time, such as is to be seen in Central France. It con sisted of a central pavilion with side wings symmetrically arranged, open balconies run ning round the first storey, and steps leading up to the principal entrance. He states that it was the most European-looking construction that he had found in Arabia ; that it was erected by Sultan Sa'id, by western builders under his orders; and that around it stood long ranges of stables and outhouses. More than half a century has elapsed since Palgrave visited Farzah, and in spite of the palace it contained, it is not possible to identify the place. Perhaps Fanjah, in the Wadi Samail (q,v.), is intended. A like mystery enshrouds the hamlets of Khabb (Kh5dh ?) and Ri'an which are also mentioned by the same traveller, FARZAN ('Am)— See Kharj.

Near its eastern extremity is a remarkable kauhab or spring of fresh water, which is 3 feet below the surface of the sea at low tide. As much as 700 gallons of excellent waterhave been obtained from it in a day.

FATIMAH (W adi)— A valley in Western Arabia which finds its way to the Red Sea about 24 sea miles south of Jiddah. It rises on the northern slopes of the Taif highlands, and, under the name of Wadi Sail, flows in a north-westerly direction to Sail, a well-known camping ground on the Darh-as-Sultdni, or Persian Hajj route. Here is a pleasant plot of the desert soil, with wild rushes, peppermint, and green grass, where the cameleers digging with their hands find at a span's depth a delicious draft of pure rain water. At Sail the valley turns south-west, and still under the name of Wadi Sail, descends to , Ain-az-Zaima, where it assumes a westerly direction. In this neighbourhood the valley is stony and has a breadth of about half a mile, with a few acacia trees growing here and there. From 'Ain-az-Zaima downwards the valley is called Wadi Fatimah. Some 10 or 12 miles below 'Ain-az-Zaima, Wadi Fatimah is joined on its right bank by its largest and most important tributary, the Wadi Laimun. The latter valley, often in its lower reaches and generally at its mouth, is known as Al-Mudhik. Below this confluence the Wadi Fatimah is a wide torrent strand without inhabitants. Here and there it has high banks, walled below with untrimmed blocks of basalt, and ovegrown with a wild tree, thanthub, all green stalks, having prickles for leaves, and bitter tasting. Bams have been built to divert the flood water to the right side of the valley, on to fields enclosed with high earthem banks, where it stands for seven or eight days. Com is then sown, and it ripens without further watering. At Az-Zibarah, where there is a large dam, there are signs of former cultivation. Lower down, the valley side to the northward is bordered with a precipice 1,000 feet high which forms the edge of Harra Ajaifah. The valley hereabouts is desolate and unfrequented. The caravan route between Jiddah and Mecca crosses Wadi Fatimah at Haddah. At that point the valley bends southward, soon, however, to resume a general south-westerly direction which it maintains until the Red Sea is reached in the neighbourhood of Ras Shi'rah. Wadi Laimun appears to have its origin in the broken country northwards of Sail. From its source it trends westwards, gradually assuming a more and more southerly course until it joins Wadi Fatimah under the name of Wadi Al-Mudhik, as we have already seen. Through that embouchure comes the Darh-as-Sultdni, or Hajj route from Qasim, and also the Darh-ash-Sharqi, or Haj route from Al-Madlnah. In the Wadi Laimun are the villages of the Hurrath, Ashraf; the Sherif of Mecca has possessions amongst them also. The Arabs in the mountains are Hadhail. The principal settlements and features in Wadi Fatimah, in descending order, are as follows:— Name. Bank. Position. Remarks.

FUJA1RAH— A village of the Shamailiyah tract in Trucial 'Oman 15 miles south of Khor Fakkan and 27 miles north-north-east of Shinas ; it is situated near the place where Wadi Ham reaches the coast and is about two miles from the sea. The landing place opposite Fujairah is called Gharaifah; but its port is Ghallah, a little to the southward, from which it is distant four miles by land and whence goods are brought on camels. Fujai rah possesses date plantations containing some 3,000 palms, amid which stands the village adjoined by a small but strong fort upon a hill. The village is completely sur rounded by a strong wall, 9 feetjiigh, to which have been added on the south and west sides an exterior ditch and breast-work. There is plenty of fresh water in wells 4 fathoms deep. The houses, in number about 150, are mostly of mud and stone, but a few are of gypsum cement. During the date harvest, when peace reigns, the inhabi tants are accustomed to camp in mat huts among their plantations outside the village walls. The people of Fujairah, who are Sharqiyin, mostly of the Hafaitat section, live by the cultivation of dates and by pearl diving; some tobacco, wheat and jowari are raised also. There are no manufactures and no shops. Fujairah is the stronghold of the Sharqi leader, Hamad-bin-'Abdullah, who since 1901 has been endeavouring to assert the independence of a part of the Shamailiyah tract against the Shaikh of Sharjah. The following places in Shamiliyah are reported to be now in the possession of Hamad and accordingly to look to Fujairah as their capital: Bithnah, Gharaifah, Marbah, Qaraiyah, Qidfa' and Saqamqam. This tract in revolt under Hamad enjoys the coun tenance of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) FULIWAN— See 'Arab (Shatt-al).

FUARA—FUQ—FtK 631 FUQAMAS— One of the Umwaliali families of the Mutair tribe {q. ■y.)- They belong to the Sahabah section of which they supply the Shaikhs. FUQARAH— A tribe of J Anizah Arabs of Al-Hajar whose circuit begins about Dar«al=Hamra and reaches to Bir-al-Ghanam ; it is not less wide from the Darb-al-Hajj eastward to Jabal Birrd. They are nearly 800 souls and their tents are two hundred ; few of them know much about any country outside their dlrdh unless it be the roads to Hail, their political, or Al-Madmah, their religious metropolis. Their ancient name is Menabaha, and they gay that the princely family of Ibn Sa'ud is of their stock. They do not wander about In firqdrii or nomad hamlets, as is the general custom with such folk, but always to gether. At Birkat Mu'adhdham is the border between the Fuqarah and the Khuthera. At Al-Hajar there are always the tents of a few nomad families of Fuqarah in front of the qaVah on the Hajj route. It is said of the Fuqarah, by the qaVah soldiery at Madain Salih, that they are more like gypsies than Bedouins, and they bear an evil reputation among the Haji, which is hardly justified, for thieving. In bygone days the Fuqarah and the Mawahib drove out the Bani Sakhr from Al-Jau, in the midst of Harrat 'Awai- tld. The Fuqarah are commonly reckoned last to the north of the Ahl Jibliyah, or southern Aarab, and their fendies are Salih, or Al-Fajir, Al-Mughassib, Zuarah, Hamdan, Hajur, 'Ainat,- Sugra, Al-Klaib and Al-Khamalah. The Fuqarah are a tribe of date-eaters and have scarcely a well-grown man or a comely woman among them. They are a fanatical people and are reckoned a tribe of horse men. They have clay summer-houses at Khaibar where they have palm plantations in old-time partnership with the negroid cultivators, descendants no doubt of former hon-vivants ; and there they draw their yearly provision of dates. Sometimes their caravans go down to Al-Wajj to sell camels and buy rice therewith and some poor Fuqarah tribesfolk are wont to carry an impure salt, which they dig in the desert near Tayma, to Al-'Ali where they receive, four riyals for their camel-load. Fuqarah eat the hedgehog and the fox, and even, it is said by their neighbours, the hysena. The Mawahib Bedouins call them despitefully Yahud Khaibar. The whole fortune of the Fuqarah in the field, with their cattle, booths, and utensils; may be estimated at £ 17,000 ; and besides this they have landed patrimony worth possibly £ 7,000 more. There is always living with the northern Walad 'Ali a body of the Fuqarah which, for a blood feud with the Bishr, might not remain in their own country. The Bishr and the twin tribes Walad 'Ali and Fuqarah, also the Mawahib and the Bani Atiyah, are all of them of one stock and kindred ; being sub-tribes of the great Ishmaelite 'Anizah nomad nation; and all, as they hold, descended from a common patriarch. Wail.— {Doughty.) It will be observed that Doughty divides the Fuqarah into eight sub-sections ; Huber divides them into nine. Only three names in the two lists appear to correspond, an apt illustration of the difficulty of tribal questions in Arabia. In the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf the Fuqarah are shown as belonging to the Bishr division of the 'Anizah {q.v.), but it is not clear that this has Doughty's support.

Immediately to the north of it is a hill called Jabal-al-Fuwairat, saparat- ing it from the site of the now deserted village of Ghariyah which is also on the coa^t; according to another account, however, the Jabal is merely a vertical cliff 30 feet high, against the foot of which the sea breaks. The village is surrounded by towers, but it is not continuously walled and there are no gates. The houses upon the circumference of the village are substantially built of stone and mud. The population of Fuwairat consists of about 100 houses of the A1 Bu Kuwarah tribe and 50 of Kiblsah : these communities are divided from one another by a well-marked street and form a southern and a northern quarter respectively. The people live chiefly by pearl diving, but they also own some 20 horses, 100 camels, 60 donkeys and 80 cattle. About 35 pearl boats, 9 other sea-going vessels, and 12 fishing boats belong to the place. There are no s ops. ndifferent water is obtained from the Zarka well, 1 mile west of the village, and good water from the wells of Filihah, and 'Ain Sanan distant 2 and 4 milesrespectively to the south-west.

Every six months this tribe holds its Qabail Bakri or tribal assembly at Fuwwah with which is combined a big fair or market. The Fuwwah Tihamah, or lowland district, stretches from south-west to north-east from Jabal-ash- Sharabah to the Mukalla hills, a distance of from 16 to 20 miles, with a breadth of about 5 miles. Although all this district seems suitable for cultivation, only that part in the immediate vicinity of the village and in the bed of the wadi is cultivated. Higher up the Wadi Fuwwah is called Wadi Qirbah in which the following villages are reported to exist Qobba. Bir Ba Rayah. Al-Irmah, Adid. Kalbuh. Al-Modainah. Baidha. Qirbat Qahwah. Al-Qara. At a distance of about 2 miles up stream from Fuwwah is the village of Kulang, and at the same distance due north from Fuwwah, the village of 'Ain-al-Ghassani, where there is a cistern to which the water from several springs is carried by means of aqueducts.— {Von Wrede, June, 1843.)

Hirsch describes Gharfah as being a town situated on the south side of Wadi Hadhramaut, and at the foot of Jabal Yircrid {Hirsch, 1893; Bent, 1894.) GHARAF (Saub-al)-— See Tigris. GHARlF (Shatt-at,)— Also called the Shatt-al-Hai; but this name, though it is still understood, seems to be passing out of general use. The Shatt-al-Gharaf is a great stream, almost a river, in Turkish 'Iraq : it leaves the right bank of the Tigris opposite Kut-al-Amarah and, running on the average about south-east by east, joins the Euphrates at two places, viz., at Hammar and at a point little belqw Nasiriyah Town. The relations to one another of the various channels of the Gharaf are explained below. The length of its course from Kut to Nasiriyah is about 120 miles; in parts where the bed is single ita average width is as much as 75 yards ; and the banks, which are of sandy alluvium, rise in places as much as 18 feet above the level of the bed. In summer the Shatt-al-Gharaf is dry, but in winter the main stream is said to have an average depth of about 6 feet and could probably be navigated by a river steamer of light draught: it is believed how ever that the waterway is silting up. The difference of level between the upper end of the Shatt-al-Gharaf on the Tigris and its lower end at Nasiriyah Town is inconsider able, and it is said that floods in the Euphrates reverse for a time the current of the stream in its lower reaches. A branch of the Shatt-al-Gharaf formerly (separated from the present bed immediately below Hai Town and rejoined it 2 or 3 miles below Qal'at Sikar; this channel is now silted up and is called the Shatt-al-A'ma or Blind River : while it still flowed the alternative branch was known as Abu Juhairah and the island enclosed between the two as Jazlrat Kinanah. At the same period the reach near Shatrat-al-Muntafik was styled the Shatt- as-Sabll, but this name seems to have fallen into desuetude. The stream is said now to divide some 3^ miles above Shatrah into two branches, of which the western is known as the Shatt-ash-Shatrah and the eastern as the Shatt-al-Badaah. The former is now the larger and steamers of 4 30 tons travelled up and down it during March of 1915. The average depth of the Shatt-al-Bada'ah is, however, perhaps greater than that of the Shatt-ash- Shattrah.* The Shatt-al-Bada'ah runs through swamps to the Euphrates at Hammar; and the Shatt-ash-Shatrah, after passing the town from which it is named, bifurcates at a place Hamzah into two channels. Of the two sub-divisions of the Shatt-ash- Shatrah the larger, known as the 'Ajuzah, goes eastward, and joins the Shatt-al-Bada'ah, while the other which is probably the original bed of the Gharaf—enters the Euphrates about 4 miles below Nasiriyah. The lower part of the Shatt-al-Gharaf in both its present branches is environed by marshes over which the inhabitants move in canoes, except in the dry season; but communication between the towns of Nasiriyah and Shatrat-al- Muntafik is ordinarily by land. The marshes on the Bada'ah branch vary in depth from 3 feet in summer to 6 or 7 feet in time of flood. ™ ra0 ^ r 64 k &gt;n £' ® M 16 beam and drawing rather over 2 feet went down the iJada ah from the Gharaf to the Hammar .lake, but had to be dragged over the Bada'ah bar.o 618 GHARAF The following are the chief points of interest on or near the westernmost (or original) bed of the Shatt-al-Gharaf, in order from its head downwards ;— Name.

These have been ex plored by French archaeologists. R emarks. The surrounding Arabs are Bani Rabi'ahof the Maiyah section. See article Hai Town, See article QaFat Sikar. The Bada'ah branch of the stream probably separates from the Shatrah branch somewhere between this place and Shatrat-al- Muntafik below. The country around Tel Luh is a swamp during half the year and a desert during the other half, the town of Shatrat-al- Muntafik lies about 8 miles to the south west of this place. See article Shatrat-al- Muntafik. Some where below this place occurs the bifurcation of the Shatrah branch into the 'Ajuzah and Nasiriyah channels. See article Nasiriyah Town.;3&amp;7 GHAElF 649 'Ceteals ate extensively ctiltivated on both sides of the Shatt-ai-GharSf, and a kind of water-lift is here in use for irrigation which resembles the balanced lever seen on the banks of the Nile and the dhenkli of the Punjab in India. The chief crops are wheat barley, maize, millet, and sesame. In the country of the Bani Rabl'ah, which adjoins the Tigris, the Shatt-al-Oharaf divides the territory of the Maiyah section of that tribe on the west from that of the Sarai section on the east side ; the rest of its course lies through the country of the Muntafik. Some authorities consider that the Shatt-al-Gharaf was originally an irrigation canal dug from the Tigris and that it has been enlarged to its present dimensions by the rush down it of the surplus waters of that river in time of flood. The main stream of the 'Tigris apparently began to flow down the bed of the Shatt-al-Gharaf about 600 A. D. and Returned to its original (and present) bed about 1550 A. D. The celebrated ancient town of Wasit-al-Hai was probably situated on the Shatt-al- Gharaf not far from the present town of Hai; it was founded by the celebrated governor Hajjaj about 703 A. D. and was called Wasit or Central because it was regarded as approximately equidistant from Kufah, Basrah, and Ahwaz. At the end of the 14th •century it was held with a garrison by Taimur Lang (Tamerlane).

At Jabal Dam the line takes a northerly direction and becomes the eastern border of Habl, the adjoining tract on this side being Biyadh until the southern end of Jau Shamin is reached ; to exclude that district the line turns westwards for some miles and then resumes its northerly course which finally ends at the point of junction of the regions of Habl, Sanfan-al-Hanna, Radaif and Jau Shamin, that is at the well of Hajrah. It should be noted that some Bedouins would include the south-western part of Habl, which lies beyond Jabal Qadam, in Wadi-al-Miyah; but this view does not appear to command general acceptance. Physical characitrislis and divisions, —-Habl is described as an expanse of dark-coloured sand in which mounds alternate with low valleys ; the hollows are full of the tree called Markh and the shrub known as Ghadha, besides which they produce 'Arfaj and Rimth bushes and Nasi, Subat and Thamam grass. Wells, however, are few and far between and they are much deeper than those of Jauf, a tract which Habl in other respects resemble. In the extreme west of the tract, immediately before the Taff hills are reached, is a bare stretch of heavy sand styled Jau-al-Ghanam ; and near the centre of the tract is a large salin depression commonly known as Khor, of which the position is more exactly fixed by the wells that it contains, viz., Umm-al-Qah and Himarah. Two hills in the district are Ghumis, 10 miles north of Jabal Mathluth, and Qaburah, which lies 17 miles westwards of the northern extremity of Jabal Dam.

The chief villages and towns inhabited by the Habus may be ascertained by refer ence to the articles on the Sharqiyah district and Wadi Samad. There is no reliable estimate of their number but it may be placed provisionally at 7,000 souls. The Habas are a wild, uncivilised, tribe less wealthy and important than their neigh bours, the Hirth and Hajriym : such influence as they possess depends on their numbers rather than on their character. They are principally engaged in date cultivation, but are also camel-owners. They have now many rifles of various cheap kinds (1905) and main tain an offensive and defensive alliance with the Hirth. The small Warud tribe is tri butary to the Habus. The principal Shaikhs of the Habus (1905) are Salim-bin-Hamaid, Ghananami, and Mas'ud-bin-Rashid, Jabiri.

HADD (1)— A village in the Sultanate of 'Oman, situated at the foot of Khor-al-Hajair, and about one mile inland in a south-westerly direction from Ras-al-Hadd, the low sandy point which marks the entrance of the Gulf of 'Oman and is almost the easternmost point in Arabia. Hadd is 16 miles east by south of Sur and may be reckoned as belonging to the coast of the Eastern Haj jar District. The village stands in a sandy plain and consists of over 200 habitations, some of which are of mud but most of date branches : it boasts a stone fort, three or four round towers, and some date trees. The water-supply is fairly good but not very abundant. The inhabitants of Hadd are civil, and belong to the Muwalikh tribe ; they live by fishing and possess 8 badans and 15 small boats ; about 30 sheep and goats constitute the whole of their livestock. The cod and other other rock-fish here are of the largest size, sometimes almost gigantic. The authority of the Sultan of 'Oman at Hadd is marked by the presence of a detach ment of 15 'Askaris, commanded by a Jama'dar under the orders of the Wali of Sur; and for purposes of revenue and taxation Hadd is treated as subordinate to Sur.—((rc^e- teer of the Persian Ghilf.) HADD (2)— A town on the south-eastern point of Muharraq Island in Bahrain. It covers the narrow promontory for a distance of about J of a mile, and at high tide is only connected with Muharraq Island by a neck of land 400 yards wide. There are a number of well- built massonry houses, perhaps 200, and a very much greater number of mud and stone houses and mat huts, perhaps 700 of each. The water supply is from wells in a date grove called Zimmah | a mile to the north. The people are Sunnis, chiefly Sadah (150 houses) and Al Bin-'Ali and Al Bu Falasah (Bani Yas) (200 houses), after each of whom a quarter is named ; there are also 20 houses of Huwalah, 10 of Al Bu Kuwarah, 10 of Sudan, 10 of Manana'ah and 1 or 2 of Al Musallam, and a fourth division of the town is called Fariq-al-Musallam. The total population is estimated at 8,000 souls. Shops only number 5 or 6. Next to Muharraq Town this is the greatest pearl diving place in Bahrain and to it belong 167 pearl boats ; vessels of all sorts are 3 Batils, 42 Baqarahs, 183 Shu'ais and Sambuks and 21 Mashuwahs and jollyboats. There are 2 horses, 110 donkeys and 35 cattle. No dates are grown, there being no space for plantations, but the grove at Zimmah belongs to Hadd.

HADHRAMAUT— Hadhramaut, in the strict sense of the term, is the name of a great valley in southern Arabia. Modern geographres, however, have applied the name loosely to the whole of the south coast of Arabia lying between this great valley and the sea ; and extending from the Aden Protectorate on the west to the 'Oman Sultanate on the east. In this wider and cdmmonly accepted signification in which it is hereinafter employed, it includes also the Mahra and Qara coasts as far eastwards as Murbat. Thus defined its limits are between 14° and 18° N. and 46° and 531° east. Its maximum depth is therefore under 170 miles ; and its length rather more than 540 miles. The coastal plain is narrow, rarely exceeding ten miles in width, and in places the hills extend to the seashore. The principal ports are Makalla, Shihair, Qusai'ir, Raidah and Saihut. The first two and the last are considerable towns, the others being fishing villages. Inland there are a few villages near the foot of the hills, with a limited area of cultivation irrigated by springs or wells in the hill torrent beds. Behind the littoral plain a range of mountains, or rather a high plateau falling steeply to the south and more gently to the north, extends continuously from the Yemen highlands on the west to the mouth of the Hadhramaut valley from which a similar range extends with hardly a break to the borders of 'Oman. Its crest line is generally some 30 miles from the coast and its average height between 4,000 and 5,000 feet. A number of wadis or ravines cutting deeply into the plateau run northward to the main Wadi Hadhramaut, a broad valley lying nearly east and west, and following, from its extreme western heads on the Yemen highlands to its mouth in Qamar Bay, a bowshaped course of over 500 miles. Beyond this valley and steadily encroaching on it, lies the great desert extending to Najd. The most westerly village in the main valley is Shabwah, in ancient days the capital, but now almost buried by the advancing desert. Lower down the first large villages are Henan and Ajlaniyah, near which at a point three miles below the town of Haurah numerous watercourses converge forming as it were a great basin.

The Sayyids, descendants of Husain, grandson of the Prophet, form a numerous and highly respected aristocracy. They are divided into families, the chiefs of which are known as Munsibs, who are looked on as the religious leaders of the people and are Ah? &gt;T e -7 &lt; fu era J? d » a j Sain&lt; f Among the loadin g families are that of Shaikh Abu Bakr of Amat, the AI Aidrus of Shihr, and the Sakkaf of Saiwun. Thev do not bear arms, nor occupy themselves in trade nor manual labour nor even agriculture • though owning a large proportion of the land, they employ slaves or bird labourers to cultivate it. As compared with the other classes they are well educated, and are strict in their observance of religious duties, and owing to the respect due to their descent they exercise a strong influence both in temporal and spiritual affairs. a trl ^ e f men ' as ln Arabia generally, are the predominant class in the population All the adults carry arms. Some of the tribes have settled towns and villages, others ad a nomadic life keeping however within the territory which is recognised as belong- u i y -u re dlvided into sections or families, each headed by a chiff whilst the head of the tribe is called the muqaddam or sultan. He is the leader in peace and m war, but the tribesmen are not his subjects ; he can only rule with their support The most powerful tribe m Hadhramaut at present is the Ka'aiti, a branch of the Yafa' tribe whose settlements lie further west. Originally invited by the Sayyids to protect the settled districts against the marauding tribes, they have established themselves as practically the rulers of the country, and now possess the coast district with the towns ^ as wel1 as Haurah ' Haj rain, and Shibam, in the interior.

The Kathiri tribe was formerly the most powerful • they occupy the towns of Saiwun, Tarim, and A1 Ghuraf in the richest part the main Hadhramaut valley. The chiefs of both the Ka'aiti and Kathiri are in political 1 relations with the British Government, through the Resident at Aden. The 'Amudi in the Wadi Duwan, and the Nahdi, Awamir and Tamimf in the main valley, are the principal tribes possessing permanent villages ; the Saiban, Hamumr, and Manahil occupy the mountains between the main valley ancf the coast. ^ r . The townsmen are the free inhabitants of the towns and villages as distinguished from the Sayyids and the tribesmen; they do not carry arms, but are the working members of the community, merchants, artificers, cultivators, and sevants, and; are entirely depen dent on the tribes and chiefs under whose protection they live. The servfle class contains a large African lement, brought over formerly when the slave trade flourished on this coast; as in all Mohammedan countries they areweH treated, and often ri^e to positions As already mentioned a large number of Arabs from Hadhramaut go abroad; the Ka'aiti tribesmen take service with the irregular troops of Hyderabad; emigration on a large scale has also gone on to the Butch colonies in Java and Sumatra since the begin- ing of the 19th century. According to the census 6f i880, quoted by Van den Berg in his Report published by the Government of the Butch East Indies in 1886, the number of Arabs in those colonies actually born m Arabia was 2,500, while those born m the colonies exceeded 20,000 ; nearly all of the former are from the towns m the Hadhramaut valley between Shibam and Tarim. *, , r o j-n : nt* tw + o Makalla and Shihr have a considerable trade wfth the Red Sea and Persian Gulf Ports, as well as with the ports of Aden, Bhafar, and Masqat. A large share Of this is in the hands of Parsee and other British Indian traders who have established themselves rn the Hadhramaut ports. The pincipal imports are wheat, rice, sugar, piece-^oods, and hardware. The exports are small; the chief items are honey, tobacco, and sharks fms. In the towns in the interior the principal industries are weaving and dyeing. The Mahra country adjoins the Hadhramaut proper, and extends along the coast trom gihut eastwards to the east of Qamr Bay, where the Qara coast begins and stretches to Murbat.

The following article brings out much additional matter regarding the Hadhramaut. A eea. In its broader sense, this region may be said to extend inland from the coast of the Arabian Sea to about lat. 17° N. ; and from long. 47° E. to long. 53° E. Its frontiers are fn no sense defined, but roughly it is bounded on the west by the Aulaki and Wahicu territory, north by the great Ahqaf tract of desert, and east by the Bhofar province o Oman. Thus considered, the region measures about 400 miles from east to west and has a depth north and south varying from about 220 miles in the west, tailing to about miles in the east. In its more restricted sense, the term Hadhramaut refers to the broad valley running for some hundreds of miles more or less parallel to the coast, by which the waters of the many valleys of a large portion of the southern Arabian tableland probably drain into the gea&gt; between Saihut and Qishn.HADHBAMAtFT 675 about ^ 8 of tie Physical Charactee. Physi ca lly the Hadhramaut may be divided in four main horizontal belts : (a) the low- j ^ l ltt0 flats and foot - hill s ; (6) a broad belt of downs or plateaux (jal) diver- sified by a few outstanding peaks ; (c) a belt of deep-cut wadis trending and sloping north and north-eastward into a great main depression ; and (d) a naked scarp and ridge wnicn skirts and merges into the great central sands. (a) The coastal belt varies in width, rarely, however, extending much more than ten mdes inland, and is an and waste of plain and low sand-hills with a gentle rise towards the southern spurs of the plateau belt. The coastline itself, which runs in a generally east-north-easterly direction, is not greatly irregmar, but has a number of projecting points with small intervening bays without deep indentations to form good natural harbours, and with here and there longer !' e V 0f '' y 0 6 ' 11 ' le the chief p romo ' to ™s are Ras el Aseida, Ras Fartak S ' Mukalla, Ras Baghashwah, Ras Atab, Ras Sharwein, and Ras (6) The plateau, which is calcareous in character and extremely arid, presents'a more or less abrupt escarpment towards the sea and is, in fact, but a continuation of the great Yemen shell or plateau and is penetrated in step-like stages by a number of rapidlv- ascendmg and burnt-up arid, or sand-covered valleys.

The surface of the plateau, which has a general slope towards the north and north-east, is comparatively uniform, with here and there a prominent peak.

The climate of the coastal region may be characterized as extremely hot and enervating (intolerably so in summer) owing largely to its aspect almost due south and to the shelter afforded bv the elevated region by which it is backed ; the heat is especially oppressive wC as not infrequently happens, there are no sea-breezes. 11 WIlen, as not Bent describes the air of the tableland as ' fresh and invigorating after tl, 0 6*^11 * heva ' e ^ b e ! ow,' and he mentions Sujeila, at an altitude of\l50 ft as ' having excellent air that would make it a first-class sanatorium for Aden.' But til upland 4B2676 HADHEAMAUT appears to be subject, at certain seasons, to a cold penetrating wind, to cold and dewy nights, and to very great extremes of temperature. Twice during the year the coastal districts, at all events, of the Hadhramaut receive their share of the rains brought by the monsoons, though probably in a less degree than the Yemen ; but the regularity of the rains in the interior is not so certain, for when the Bents visited the Wadi Ser in 1894 they were told by the inhabitants that they had had no rain for two years, and that they were sometimes without any for as much as three years at a time. Thunderstorms of a very sudden and violent nature are recorded by travellers, those being usually preceded by fierce heat and hot and violent whirlwinds, from all sides, that disturb the dust. According to the Arabs, a particularly hot wind less period of about forty days Occurs with the changing of the monsoons. All travellers in the Hadhramaut make frequent allusions to the intensely high tem peratures experienced in the narrow confined wadis of the interior. Van den Berg Says that sicknesses are relatively few, which is quite natural, seeing the simple life led by the people, the pure and generally dry atmosphere of the moun tains, and the total abstention of the people from pork, opium, and alcohol Cholera is unknown, small-pox is never epidemic, but consumption is rampant, and there are cases of leprosy. PcKPliLATiaK. The total population of the Hadhramaut is extremely uncertain, and the various authorities give very divergent estimates, Mons Babahir, whom Van den Berg cites as having had considerable facilities for judging, estimates it at about 150,000, which he locates as follows ;— From Shibam to Shabwah, including Wadis Irma, Balir, and Rakhia - - - - - • • • 20,000 Wadis Amd, Du'an, and EI Ain .. Shibam to Terim (inclusive) Terim to Saihut From N. of the main wadi to the desert From S. of the main wadi to the sea Bhehr and Mukulla and their environs 25,000 50,000 6,000 15,000 16,000 18,000 Total 150,000 Van den Berg, however, considers this estimate to be excessive, seeing that the greater part of the region is uninhabitable and unsuitable for agricultural pursuits of any kind. He himself gives the total of the chief centres of population of the interior, viz., Saiyun, Terim, Shibam, A1 Ghorfah, and Ainat, as certainly not exceeding 20,500. The people are known as Hadhrami (plu. Hadarim) and belong generally to the South Arabian stock, claiming descent from Y'arab bin Kahtan. There is, however, a large number of ' Seyyids,' or descendants of the prophet (described more fully below), and of 'townsmen' of northern origin, besides a considerable,class of African or of mixed descent; but in spite of these variations they form, geographically and socially, a remarkable homogeneous whole. _ _ , . i i , An authoritv 1 says, in substance, that the districts of the Hadhramaut are singularly fertile and self-sufficing, and are so situated geographically as ^ cl ?f el £ ^ 0 n g ^ r and to be isolated socially, as a whole, from the rest of Arabia ; while, at the samo timo. they lie within reach of ports which are in constant communication with mid-eastern Africa and India. To the north stretches unbroken the most terrible waste of sand- dunes in the peninsula ; to the east the district is practically isolated from the Oman provinces by the almost waterless desert of Mahra ; while to the west it is difficult access from the Yemen and its outlying provinces on account of a mountainous and sterile desert steppe which, up to the present, remams almost entirely unexploied. In more frequent and easier communication with Moslem communities outside Arabi than within it, the population of the Hadhramaut, therefore, has had ample opportunity to develop particularism in its social organization as well as m its religious spirit, ihe fertility of its lands makes its farmers self-sufficient and jealous with the jealousy ot 1 Hogarth: The Penetration of Arabia,HADHRAMAUT 677 men who have much to lose ; and, while their relations with Africa have given them unusual wealth of slaves, their relations with India and other parts of the East, greatly enhancing their material civilization, have at the same time made them fullv aware of the nature of European rule and the danger of giving free entrance to members of a race which condemns slavery. For long they succeeded in barring the way to the encroachments of all foreigners, and it is only within comparatively recent times that travellers, and those few in number, have succeeded in wresting information, and that only to a very limited extent, about the social organization and customs and manners of this interesting and highly exclusive The population may be divided into four more or less distinct classes ;— 1. The Seyyids. 2. The Tribesmen. 3. The Townsmen. 4. The Servile classes, or slaves. The Seyyids, descendants of Hussein, grandson of Mohammed, form a numerous and highly respected aristocracy. They are divided into families, the heads of which are known as 4 Munsibs,' who are looked upon as the religious leaders of the people and are in some cases venerated as saints. They do not bear arms^ nor occupy themselves in trade or manual labour, or even agriculture ; though owning a large proportion of the land, they employ slaves or hired labourers to cultivate it. As compared with the other classes, they are well educated, are strict in their religious observances, and, owing to the respect due to their descent, they exercise a strong influence both in temporal and spiritual matters. The Tribesmen, as in Arabia generally, are the most interesting part of the Hadhra- maut population and are the predominant class. All the adults carry arms. Some of the tribes have settled towns ; others lead a nomadic life, keeping, however, within their own recognized territory. They are divided into families, each headed by a chief or Abu,' while the head of the tribe is known as the ' Muqaddam,' or tribal lord. Though the tribesmen are not his subjects, he is their leader in war or peace ; he can rule only with their support, and his authority depends largely on his personality. The most powerful family, at present, is the Kaiti, a branch of the Yafai tribe, whose territory lies further west. Originally invited by the Seyyids to protect the settled districts from the attacks of marauding tribes, they have established themselves as practically the rulers of the country, and now possess the coast district with the towns of Shehr and Mukulla, as well as Hajerein, Haurah, Qutan, and Shibam in the interior. The Head of this family has accumulated great wealth and has risen to the highest posi tion in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad, as ' Jemadar/ or commander of an Arab levy composed of his tribesmen, numbers of whom go to the East and elsewhere to seek their fortune. The Kathiri tribe was formerly the most powerful; they now occupy the greater part of the central Hadhramaut—Saiyun, Terim, and El Ghoraf being their chief strongholds. These two tribes are extremely hostile to each other. The para mount chiefs of both are in political relations with the British Government, through the Resident, at Aden. The Hadhramaut tribal chiefs nominally, also, recognize the supremacy of the Sublime Porte and 4 assume ' to be his proteges, but no part of the country has ever been really incorporated in the Ottoman Empire, nor has the Porte ever imposed taxes, or even sent troops or officials, nor exercised any form of sovereignty. By so doing it would doubtless meet with the most obstinate resistance : on the other hand, the Turks have never sought the aid of the Hadhramaut chiefs. The other principal tribes, but comparatively much less powerful than the two fore going, are : the Amudi, in Wadi Du'an ; the Nahadi, in the upper central Hadhramaut; the Jabir, in the southern side of the main wadi; the Awamir and Tamimi in the lower central Hadhramaut, east of the Jabir ; the Hamumi and Manahil, in the plateau region and the lower Hudhramaut; and the Mahri, east of the lower Hadhramaut. The Mehra country in a sense links the Hadhramaut proper on the west with the Qara territory in the western confines of the Oman. The Sultan of the Mahra, to whom Sokotra also belongs, lives at Qishn, a rather poor fishing village about 30 miles west of Pvas Fartak. Sihut, situated near the mouth of the main Hadhramaut valley, is a678 HADHEAMAUT similar village, and El Hafa is another thriving village on the coast from which 9,000 cwt. of frankincense is exported annually, principlly to Bombay. The Townsmen are the free inhabitants of the towns and villages as distinguished from the Seyyids and the tribesmen ; they do not carry arms, but are the working members of the community, merchants, citizens, cultivators, and servants, and are entirely dependent on the tribes and chiefs under whose protection they live, and it is to be noted that taxes fall almost exclusively on them. The Servile class contains a large African element, brought over formerly when the slave trade flourished on this coast. They follow the profession of their masters— the slaves of a member of a tribe carry arms or cultivate the fields ; those of a townsman follow the occupation of the master. As in all Mohammedan countries, they are generally well treated and often rise to positions of trust. A large number of Arabs from Hadhramaut go abroad; many of the Kaiti take service in the irregular troops of Hyderabad, and emigration to the Dutch colonies in Java and Sumatra has also gone on since the beginning of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, a large number of Parsee and British Indian traders have established themselves in the Hadhramaut parts, which carry on a considerable coasting trade with the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. The combatant portion of the population is composed of bands of irregulars and con sists generally of the members of the tribes and their families who know all the use of arms. Some chiefs have in addition a kind of particular and more disciplined guard and corps of armed slaves. Thus the Jemadar has an army, though somewhat irregular, of about 5,000 men and 1,500 slaves, which is mainly in garrison in the different towns which recognize his authority ; they are lodged and nourished at his expense and receive a small pay. The 4 Lord' of Saiyun has also about 1,000 armed slaves. There is no cavalry in the Hadhramaut. Of government administration as a whole, in spite of the comparative homogeneity of the region, in the usually accepted sense of the term, there is none. The tribal lords have no care regarding what is considered in Europe as the duties of government. Edu cation, police, and public works are left entirely to private intiative, from which it results that the two last are almost entirely non-existent. Instruction alone, in a comparative sense, flourishes, and that only among the Seyyids and Towns men. There are some schools for so-called primary, secondary, and higher instruction ; in the two former the teaching is almost exclusively confined to language, grammar, and religion. The chief centre of higher instruction is at Saiyun, where the school, known by the name Robat, is a sort of annexe to the Great Mosque, and where there are about 100 students who receive free board and lodging and 300 outside students who pay fees of varying amounts. Here, too, the teaching is confined to the intensive study of grammar, the law, and theology, to the almost entire exclusion of the so-called modern sciences, astronomy (as interpreted by the Arabs) alone excepted. The study of medi cine, among others, is entirely and absolutely non-existent. The Law and Magistracy. The influence of the Seyyids is a powerful curb on any oppression by the Moqaddams or tribal lords, and in the Hadhramaut there is a suffi ciently independent magistrature. The Seyyids have the greatest interest that the Mussalman law is honoured and respected, because the law and religion are one— the decadence of religion would inevitably bring about the loss of that superstitious respect which the people have for them as descendants of the prophet. Each town or village of any importance has a Qadi with a Sub-Qadi (suppliant) for the country district round about. The Qadis are nominated by the Moqaddams, who all the same have recourse to the Seyyids and renowned savants before fixing on their choice ; Sub-Qadis are nominated by the Qadis. The Qadis have both civil and criminal jurisdiction, and base their decisions on the works of the jurists of the Shafei rite. Judg ments must be drawn up in writing and signed and sealed by the Qadi by whom delivered, but can only be put into execution on authorization by the Moqaddam, who, however, uses this prerogative but rarely. The jurisdiction of the Sub-Qadis is limited to marriage and other acts relating to family life, this being explained by the fact that the majority of the inhabitants of the country rarely have recourse to the judge in their general affairs. Differences between persons of the same family are in general adjusted by the ' Abu' ' and differences between persons belonging to entirely different families by the Moqad-HADHRAMAUT 679 dam. In the latter cases, failing accord, justice is settled by the law of the strongest, but; if blood is spilt, there generally arises a vendetta of long duration—there are examples of vendetta of 20 to 30 years' duration for puerile reasons—and these sometimes involve and draw in whole tribes. The political conditions of the Hadhramaut are further discussed under the Section Aden. Industries and Aoricxjl'Ture. Of great industries there are naturally none in the Hadhramaut. A small amount of Weaving is carried on in the houses, especially at Terim, but the amount is decreasing owing to the importation of stuffs from abroad. Formerly the cultivation and prepara tion of indigo for the dyeing of locally woven stuffs was carried on to a considerable extent, but that industry too has greatly declined except in the more remote districts of the interior. Boat-building, fishing and the salting of fish are the occupation of many along the littoral. It has been remarked that the inhabitants of the Hadhramaut mountains become tho most intrepid sailors ; not only the Arabs of Shehr and MukaUa, but even those of the mountain regions show an innate disposition for navigation, even those who may never have seen a boat before. For the most part the land in the settled centres is in the hands of the Seyyids or of other influential members of a tribe. The chief agricultural products are wheat, maize, millet, indigo, tobacco, sesame, dates and cocoanuts, the latter grown only on the littoral. Cotton is cultivated here and there, but in insufficient quantities to supply the needs of the district; lucerne is much grown for fodder. A kind of tobacco, known as Hamumi, is grown round Ghail ba Wazir and has a great local reputation. There are plantations of ithl (tamarisk) and ilb, two kinds of wood suitable for making utensils and for building construction. Irrigation is almost entirely artificial; neither the rains nor the variable streams are in general directly suitable for this purpose, but the watering of the soil is done almost entirely from wells. These may be sunk practically everywhere in the valleys. The water is drawn up in a large bucket by the aid of oxen attached to a cord which passes over a pulley fixed to a wooden beam supported on two upright pieces of wood ; the water thus obtained is received in a larged wooden trough, whence it is spread over the land by means of little canals. The solar, not the lunar, months of the Mussulmans are followed and the ends of the seasons are determined by the stars. Cattle-rearing is the principal occupation of the Bedouin. Camels and donkeys are reared for transport purposes; sheep for killing and for milk; cows only for milk and irrigation work ; oxen exclusively for ploughing. Horses are very rare ; and are consider ed as animals de luxe. Bees are very numerous, and much honey is produced. The wild animals most largely found are the rabbit, gazelle, wild goat, jerboa, hyet^aj hedgehog, a large species of lizard (permitted as food to Mussulmans) and the panther, tiger, wolf; and monkey (not permitted as food). Trade and Commeboe. The only ports of importance commercially are Mukalla and Shihair, and even at these the trade carried on is purely coastal, with the near coast of Africa, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the southern coast of Arabia, and above all with Aden and Mascat. Trade by caravans is carried on from these ports with the whole of the interior of the Hydhramaut and with the southern Arabian littoral as far as Yemen on the west and Oman on the east. Borum, Qosair, and Saihut are small fishing villages. There are no made routes of transport; the routes follow the courses of the wadis or natural paths. Transport by wheeled vehicles is impossible everywhere ; all is carried on by camels or donkeys. Transport, however, is relatively cheap; e.g., a camel from Shehr or Mukalla to Saiyun costs only 5 florins in the good season, but in summer when forage is scarce it is higher, but never above 10 florins. The chief exports are dates, stuffs dyed with indigo, a superior quality of wheat, and honey ; smaller exports of shells and fins of fish, the latter exported to India and China. Imports: wheat, butter, cocoanuts, coffee, sugar, rice, cotton and cotton stuffs, pottery^ bars of iron and worked iron, sesame oil, petroleum, and tinware*680 HADHRAMAUT C urrency^ The coins in use are :— Copper.

There is also a coin, current in some districts, called Buqshah, worth i Khumsiah ; and a copper coin, current only at Shehr, the Diwani, worth J Khumsiah. The five-franc piece, in place of the Qirsh, is popularly current all over the Hadhramaut^ and the 10-cent pieces of the Dutch East Indies are largely in use. Money has a high purchasing power in the Hadhramaut, or, what is the same thing, everything of native production is incredibly cheap ; the only dear articles are horses and arms. With the exception of that of the Jemadar of Shehr, there are no great fortunes on the Hadhramaut; his resources may be placed at several millions of florins, invested mostly, however, in India. The tribal ' Lord ' of Saiyun possesses a fortune of some hundreds of thousands, mainly property in the country, and there are some few individuals with fortunes nearing 100,000. Amongst the Beduins money is rare. W eights and M easures. The weights are as follows:— Qaflah -}- 2J Grammes. Oqiah = 10 Qaflah. Rati — 12 Oqiah (16 Oqiah at Mukalla and Shehr). Rafah = 12 Rati.

The houses in the Hadhramaut are often well ventilated and comparatively clean. A point that at first strikes the traveller is the form and character of the larger houses of well-to-do townsmen. Often of several stories in height, they are mainly built of sun-dried brick on a foundation of one or two stories of hewn stone, clay being used instead of mortar. The upper stories are usually whitewashed on the exterior, and this gives the towns a striking and bright appearance when seen from a distance. The house is usually approached through a courtyard surrounded by a wall two yards or so in height. The entrance door is often very solid and ornamented in arabesque or with iron nails or polished brass, and usually carries a knocker. The door leads into a passage, with cellars and storerooms to right and left, and conducts to a courtyard at the back around which are the kitchen and other domestic offices and in the case of the larger houses a private well. The bulding narrows and the walls become thinner at each succeeding story ; there is usually a balconi, at each floor, on the right and left, surrounded by a low wall of masonry3&amp;r HADHRAMAUT 081 tut rarely covered as is usual in most Mohammedan countries.

The so-called castles of the Hadhramaut a.re constructed inmuch the same fashion as the houses, only on a larger scale, some of them even being of vast size and not iS™tly covenng an acre or more of ground.

Divorce is very rare, the repudiation of a wife without very reasonable cause being held in high contempt, and in so doing the individual would certainly fail to obtain another wife in the same social scale. Polygamy is very uncommon ; there is no harem and no eunuchs; in the event of the husband taking another wife, the first quits his roof immediately and returns to her parents. Amongst the Beduin of the Hadhramaut, polygamy is absolutely unknown. If a man definitely leaves his town to seek fortune elsewhere, the wife may, and usually does, refuse to follow him in this contingency it is considered legitimate for him to take another wife, and he is not expected to continue to support the first. The marriage dowry takes a somewhat peculiar form and is of a double character ; there is, first of all, a legal ' tarif ' varying from 20 to 2J florins, according to the social scale of the fiancee ;-and secondly, there is the nuptial gift, the amount of which varies? according to the personal qualities of the fiancee ; the first may be reclaimed in the case of a dissolution of marriage, the latter not. In the Hadhramaut, the poor and rich dress much alike in form and style, the quality of the material, the jewels worn, and the arms carried being the only indications of stutus. The clothes worn by the townsmen resemble, in most respects, those of most orientals. Sandals with thin soles, but no stockings, are worn ; when out of doors a kind of plaid iradi), made locally, about seven yards long and a little short of a yard wide, is invariably carried or thrown over the sholders. The head is shaven. The garments of the tribesmen are similar in the main to those of the townsmen, except that they are shorter, are worn somewhat differently, and the material is usually woven in diamond ' check ' ; the jihbah or outer mantle is replaced by a shorter buttoned Jacket; and the tribesmen carry their arms, a straight sword, a two-edged poniard,, etc. The radi is also worn. The hair is grown long and falls over the shoulders, and the head is covered either with a plain piece of stuff {dismal) worn turban-like or with a fringed head-cloth {jihaf) falling over the shoulders. The Beduin wear the same type of costume as the other members of their tribe, but ©f poorer material; they rarely wear sandals, and have their bodies* bare above the waist band and below the knees. • • . The garments, of the women are very similar to those of the men, and, excepting m small particulars y like the dress in other districts of Arabia. They ordinarily wear not sandals but boots of a yellow or red colour ; they wear their hair in short tresses to the number of from 50 to 60, and married women, in addition, have a fringe, oyer the fore head. The better classes go veiled, but the lower classes cover the head with a form of kerchief {miqhah) which they can use as a veil to cover the forehead and mouth, if need be. Young girls do not cover the face. towns; The larger towns in the Hadhramaut are not disagreeable in appearance. In general they are well aired and comparatively clean; the streets are never paved, but on account of the favourable climatic conditions and of the stony and porous nature of the soil, this is no serious drawback. Along the wider streets little streams of water {midjaf frequently run. The principal towns have bastioned ramparts and gates, and these usually have a permanent guard and are shut at night; many towns in addition are flanked by towers {kut) or castles (husn), of which the garrisons are composed of armed slaves under the command of the dominant tribe. Some towns, and notably Terim, have an extraordinary number of these exterior fortresses, distributed over a wide area, and occupying every available commanding position. HADHRAMAUT TRIBES.

They are said to have 4,000 men. OLEH— The Oleh are a powerful confederation of tribes, descended from a chief Of that name, in a district known as Dathineh, which, however, only occupies the centre of the confe deration. Its limits are rather vague. The boundaries of the confederation are, on the north Upper Aulaki, on the south the Markushi section of the Fadli Confederation^ on the east Lower Aulaki, and on the west and north-west the Audhillah, with whom they have an hereditary feud. They number about 3,000 fighting men of good material, but undisciplined and lacking eohesion. They have no paramount chief, but Sheikh Al; ibn Alawi of the Elhin, who claims descent from the common ancestor, Oleh, influences tribal policy to a certain extent. He has the right to adjust disputes between any tribes of the confederation. There are three main family divisions of the Oleh, their family names being at the present time merely abstract titles denoting the branch from which each tribe was originally descended. They are the Ahl Ba Lail, the Ahl Arman, and the Ahl Said. The Ahl Ba Lail are the most numerous division, mustering'nearly 1,500 fighting mem They occupy the south-eastern portion of the confederation and have a bad name for raiding caravans, although such acts are by no means common. Their Akil is Awad ibn Haidra of the Ahl Hanash. They are all nomadic and pastoral, but own a few fortified villages and possess a little arable land. The Ahl Arman number 700 men and are mountaineers, pastoral and semi-nomadic^ The Ahl Said dwell in the plain of Amudiyah and are^the richest and most civilised portion of the confederation. They are agricultural, settled and trading. OLEH CONFEDERATION— Ahl Ba Lail. Akil, Awad ibn Heidrah of the Ahl Hanash. Tribe. Nos. Sub-Tribe. Eemakks.

HADIBU— This village, known locally as Hadibu but elsewhere often as Tamarida, is the capital of Soqotrah, and is picturesquely situated on the north coast at the head of the- open bay of the same name, on a semi-circular plain enclosed by spurs of tho Haghier mountains. The village consists of huts, and contains about 400 inhabitants. It is surrounded by a dense grove of date palms. Hadibu consists of whitewashed houses and two new mosques also whitewashed, with no architectural pretensions. The vil lage, which contains about 400 inhabitants, possesses a running stream and a lagoon; and is surrounded by palm groves. The Sultan of Soqotrah, who belongs to the family of the Sultan of Qishn, has a castle at Hadibu of poor and delapidated appearance which he rarely inhabits, preferring to live either in the hills, or at his miserable house at Haulaf, some eight miles along the coast from Hadibu. On the plain behind the village there is a conical hill called Hasan, about 200 feet high; it has been fortified as an Acropolis, and j provided with cemented tanks which are probably Arabic. A contingent of Indian troops was encamped on this plain for a short period in 1835. The Arab merchants of Hadibu are the sole camel proprietors in Soqotrah. Near the Hadibu stream is a ruined village, only one house of which is still inhabited; it has circular walls and a circular paddock adjoining it for cattle.— {Bent, 1897 ; and Enc. Britt.)

HAFAR— An important halting place and group of wells in the Batin section of Wadi-ar-Rummah near the point where it leaves Dahanah and reaches Dibdibah. Hafar lies about 160 miles west-south-west of Kuwait Town, from which it is reached in from 3 to 5 stages. The wells of Hafar are about 40 in number, but at the present time only 11 are ' alive/' that is to say, yield water. They are scattered in the bed of the Batin, which here forms a circular plain about 3 miles in diameter, at intervals, of 100 yards to J- of a mile apart ; each well is in the centre of a mound, about 10 feet high, which has been formed by the spoil removed from it. The wells are lined with rough stone masonry and are about 6 feet across at the top ; their average depth is about 150 feet to water, but if left undis turbed for a time the level rises by about 30 feet. The water they contain is almost tepid, and m the chilly air of morning vapour can be seen rising from their mouths. South by east from the wells, between them and the right bank of the Batin is a lone low, sandy hill. ^ No firewood is available in the immediate vicinity and the only fuel at hand is camel dung. The Mutair, Dhafir, and various tribes of Kuwait territory make some use of these wells, and they would be more frequented if they were of a less inconvenient depth Hatar is one of the recognised stages on the direct route between Kuwait and Qasim via the Batm, a route however which is not used by caravans and only occasionally by despatch riders. Hafar marks approximately the frontier on this side between Kuwait and Jabal Shammar ; according to Shakespear the position of the wells is about 28° 28' North and 45° 50' East. At Hafar two hollows join the Batin depression, one apparently coming from due north and the other from the south ; the former is called Falaij-ash-Shamaliyah and leads to a line of wells styled Atwal-adh-Dhadfir running northwards, of which the first is Dalai- mTyah ; the other hollow, named Falaij-al-JanubTyah, conduct similarly to a line of wells having a southerly direction and known as Atwal-al-Mutair, of which the first is Safah in Summan ; the wells of each of these series are said to lie from 2 to 3 davs' march apart.

About two-thirds of the town consists of brick houses and the rest of huts. The population is 4,000 souls, of whom three-fourths are Shi'ahs ; but there is a considerable Jewish community, which maintains a Jewish school, besides about 100 households of Faili Kurds. The surrounding Arabs belong to the Sarai section of the Bani Rabiah tribe. The neighbourhood of Hai produces wheat, barley, millet, maize, sesame and some dates ; the export trade is chiefly in these and in pastoral produce such as ghi, wool, skins and hides. There is a bazaar of about 300 shops. Hai was the seat of a Qaim Maqam, and possesses a customs house, telegraph and post offices and several khans and public baths. The telegraphic connection is with Kut-ul-Amarah. The town is constituted as a municipality. The climate of Hai is dry and healthy. HAIBAL QABRAIN— The highest point of a tableland which slopes gently down towards the north to the main valley of the Hadhramaut, and north-east towards the Wadi Adim; and more steeply towards the coast.

Northbrook on the 28th June, 1915. This cluster of hills is generally known as Jabal Kuwah by the British and Jabal Haikah by the Turks but it would appear that these names properly belong to two peaks and not to the who^e range, Jabal Haikah being in Yemen and Jabal Kuwah in the Aden Protectorate The latter is 516 feet high. HAIKI— A tribal district in Southern Yemen lying to the south-east of Mokhz.—i Hunter's Map of Arabia, 1908.) v HAIL— The capital the Jabal Shammar province of Central Arabia ; it is situated about 400 miles west-south-west of Basrah, 350 miles north-west by west of Riyadh, 450 miles 4 t 2m HAIL north-east of Mecca and 500 miles south east of Jerusalem; its elevation above the sea is 3,530 feet. Site and sorroundings. —Hail lies in the plain called Batn on the open valley of Wadi Da'aijan, and is overlooked by the cliffs of Jabal Aja, which rise 1,000 feet high about 3 miles to the westward. The town is enclosed on its north and east sides by Jabil Samra, a double hill of dark coloured plutonic basalt; Umm Arkab the eastern eminence with its summit 3,990 feet above the sea, is the higher of the two, and between it and its neighbour passes Wadi Da'aijan on its way beyond Hail to the open desert. A basaltic ridge, 300 feet high at the loftiest part connects JabalAj a with Jabal Samra, screening Hail from view from the northward ; this ridge is crossed by a pass with an elevation of about 60 feet. Hail is surrounded with a mud wall, 15 feet h gh,with towers. The wall, however, does not include the palm gardens and scattered houses lying to the north in the narrow valley between the two Samrahs. Quarters and Streets. —In shape the town is roughly a parallelogram with one of its longer sides upon Wadi Da'aijan, which passes it upon the north. The quarters of the town, roughly in order from west to east, are Samah, Barzan, Sabhan, 'Abid, Lubdah, Maghithah, 'Atiq, Jabarah, Jar ad, Qaraishi, Rakhis, Faraikh, Dhuba'an, Ziqidi, and Wasaitah ; {q.v.) and there are to the east two detached quarters or villages named Kharaimi Wasit or Suwaifllah. Barzan, Lubdah and Maghithah are the largest of the wards. Barzan contains the Qasr or fortified palace of the Amir of Jabal Shammar ; Ludah contains the principal bazaar. For some time about 1878 Wasaitah remained uninhabited, having been depopulated by an epidemic of cholera, probably that of 1871 ; it is adjoined by the common cemetery of Hail. At Kharaimi is a large date plantation, watered by springs, which is the property of the Amir. Suwaiflah is about 2 miles north east from the main body of the town, and beyond Jabal Samra ; it also was devastated by the epidemic which temporarily ruined Wasaitah and is still deserted. The main place of the town is the Mis-hab, 250 yards long by 25 broad, on one side of which is the Amir's Qasr, while opposite is a row of rooms, called Makhazin where the guests of the Amir are lodged. At the south end of the Makhazin is an enclosure set apart for female stall- keepers who deal in ornaments, perfumes, female attire, dates and vegetables ; and immediately beyond this enclosure is the head of the main bazaar, locally called Mabi', which is a continuation of the Mis-hab 200 yards in length and contains about 140 shops. These shops are the property of the Amir and are rented from him. The chief mosque of Hail stands at the south end of the Mis-hab. Buildings. —The houses of Hail have generally an upper storey and are built of small dried bricks and date or Ithl timber ; the coffee rooms and the guest's quarters pertain- suning to them are usually in an adjoining quadrangle with a separate entrance. Rooms which are ordinarily few but large and commodious, are lighted only by the door-ways and by unglazed openings in the walls just below the ceilings. The general view of the town is not imposing. The only large building is the Amir's Qasr, built of clay and overlaid with white gypsum plaster; part of it rises to a height of 40 feet. The quarters containing the palace and the main bazaar are divided from the rest of the town by a wall, and the gate leading into the main bazaar is closed at n'ght. The five gates in the town wall are guarded by slaves and closed at sunset. Population. —The size of Hail is small in proportion to its political importance ; it seems clear that the population does not exceed 4,000—5,000 souls. It is composed of agricul turists, tradesmen, men-at-arms and household slaves ,* the last are not numerous. The people are mainly Shammar, but among them are some natives of Qasim besides Gallas and a few Persians. The typical Hail townsmen is of slender build. All classes and both sexes wear next their skins the Haqu, a plaited leather belt, and in this they resemble the Arabs of the desert. Food is universally served on the floor and, contrary to the practice of Jauf-al-Umr and other northern places, it is exposed for sale in open markets. The morals of Hail are reputed lax. There are four ordinary schools. Trade and Industries. —The commerce of the town is small and its manufactures are few. The butcher's trade is considered degrading and the cook-shops in the bazaar are mostly kept by Persians. The shop-keepers are generally natives of Najaf. Qasim, or A1 Madinah. Cloth, calico, spices, metals and European goods are imported from Basrah, Najaf and A1 Madinah ; corn from Suq-ash-Shuyukh. Artisans are not many; they belong to the smiths' caste and their implements are few and clumsy; nevertheless3-72 HAI—HAI 693 copperware, spear-heads, and horse-shoes are manufactured, wooden bowls are turned, and camel-saddles are built. There are a few house builders and gypsum plasterers. Women embroiderers in silk and metail-thread do a small business. The largest trading capital in Hail probably does not exceed £300. Supplies. —'Ordinary supplies are obtainable. There are the ordinary livestock, also horses and riding camels; the large black sheep of Jabal Shammar are famous and much prized in the Damascus market. Home-grown dates are not very abundant and stocks are imported from Qasim. Wood and grass are mostly collected by Qaslmi labourers, and the town has many wells of 10 to 15 fathoms' depth ; but, with the exception of one sweat well of 15 fathoms belonging to the Samah quarter, they are either bitter or saline. General. —The present town of Hail is probably of late foundation. A more ancient town is said to have existed to the east of modern Hail and to have included Suwaiflah. Hail has risen to importance chiefly as the permanent residence of the Amirs of Jabal Shammar. When the fortunes of Ibn Rashid were in the ascendant there was much going and coming of strangers and the Amir entertained about 180 guests a day at an annual expense of about £1,500. Hail in time past also derived much profit from the transit of Persian pilgrims caravans on th3ir way to and from Mecca, but in recent years the route has been to a great extent in abeyance owing to the incessant wars and pre vailing insecurity.

HAISHIRI—• See Miyah (Wadi-al). HAISIYAH— The name of two waterways in the 'Aridh district of central Arabia and descending from opposite sides of Jabal Tuwaiq. By one authority* these waterways are distin guished by the names of the eastern and western Haislyah ; here, however, it is proposed to term the eastern or greater, Wadi HaisTyah, and the other Sha'ib Haislyah. Wadi Haislyah has its origin on the eastern slopes of Jabal Tuwaiq, at a distance of about 50 milee east of Riyadh and flows towards the east. It is one of four or more valleys which unite and form Wadi Hanifah {q. v.). The shortest and most direct route from Qaslm to Riyah passes down Wadi Hais'yah which runs through a gorge with sides 200 feet high at first and lessening as the gorge fans out. Some three miles below the watershed at the head of Wadi Haislyah this valley is joined by another called Wadi-al- Khumar which comes in form the northward. Wadi Haisiyah only contains water after rain and is thickly grown with acacia and other trees. Sha'ib HaisTyah rises on the opposite slope of Jabal Tawaiq to Wadi Haisiyah and trends westwards through a gorge which at mile 2, according to Leachman, is about J a mile wide ; three miles further on, where the track to Buraidah leads off to the north west, it widens out to about 5 miles. Between these two points Sha'ib Haislyah is a mass of trees and bushes. Near its head it contains some shallow wells called Hasyan in which water stands two at fathoms. The whole of this gorge, that is to say on both sides of the watershed, is known as the Haislyah gorge. * Gazetteer of the Persian Quif.,2-74 HAI—HAI 697 HAITHADH— A village in Wadi Haithadh ; see Wadi Mijlas.

HAJA— A village in Yemen, 56 miles from Lahiyah on the Lahiyah-Sana'a route. It is the place where the route bifurcates to Sana'a. HAJAILAH— A small town in Yemen, 60 miles by road east-north-east from Hodaidah, with population of 1,500 souls. It is situated on a stony plateau some 1,800 feet high, and contains a military telegraph office and an ambah, or defensible sarai, which though it dominates the township clustering below it, is itself commanded at 1,000 yards by a hill on the left bank of Wadi Hajjan. This ambah, which also commands the water supply of Hajailah, has'a clear field of fire in all directions and it is usually occupied by a detachj ment of one company of infantry from Manakhah. Wadi Hajjan is half a mile wide opposite Hajailah, the bed itself being only about 30 yards wide, but it is bordered by broad tracts of arable land that reach right up to the town. Here the Hajjan receives the drainage of Jabal Lahab through Wadi Mawad before the main stream enters the gap between the Bura and Damr ranges. The Hajjan and Mawad feoth come down in frequent spate during the summer thunderstorms which begin in April. There is one well in a small ravine east of the town, and there are report ed to be others. The water supply though plentiful in summer is often inadequate in winter when prolonged drought is usual. Supplies consist of cereals grown locally, chiefly red and white dura and maize. Fresh vegetables are brought in from Safa'an, and livestock from the district. A small market is held on Thursdays for general goods when there is also a brisk forwarding trade in coffee brought down from the hills both for the Tihamah and for export. Supplies could be much increased by a more efficient local administration. Hajailah possesses good fodder which consists mainly of dura, both grain and stalks, and grass from the foothills. The town is administered by a Mudir who is subordinate to the Qaimmaqam of Manakhah. HAJAIRAH— See Batinala. HAJALIYAH— A coffee-house on the Jiddah-Mecca route, seven hours distant from Haddah, with a large well near it which supplies the camel-drivers of the Syrian pilgrim caravan on their way to and from Makkah.—(J.

A remarkable hilly tract or range of the mountains in the Sultanate of 'Oman, extending from Shinason the north-west to Sur on the south east ; it is nowhere far distant from the coast, and east of Masqat Town it closely adjoins the sea. Ha jar is the aggregate forms one of the most extensive districts in the 'Oman Sultanate ; for, while its breadth varies from 20 to 50 miles, its length exceeds that of any other two districts together. According to native ideas the Hajar is all one,- but for convenience we may divide it at Wadi Samail (including that valley and its affluents in the eastern portion) and deal with it in two articles under the names of Eastern and Western Hajar.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) HAJAR (M adain S alih)— A railway station, at an altitude of 2,600 feet, in Hejaz. It is on the western edge of the Safaha Desert and is 214 miles from Mecca. Water is raised from a well 26 feet deep, by a Persian wheel worked by mules. This well is called the Bir-an-Naga, and supplies a cistern 18 yards by 22 yards and is 18 feet deep, which lies to the south. The water is bad and the supply poor.— [Doughty 1876; Maunsell, 1907.) HAJAR— See Bahrain (Island). Towns, villages, etc. HAJAR— See Aden Protectorate. HAJAR— A deserted village that stood about a mile south of Jammah, in the Wadi Fara' [q. v.) HAJAR (A l)— The valley plain of Maidan Salih, in the Hejaz. It is encompassed with sand-rock precipices, upon which lie high sand drifts. The plain itself is of loamy sand, with much growth of desert bushes and some acacia trees and a thin sprinkling of volcanic drift. In ancient times Al-Hajar was the site of an emporium on the Syria-Yemen caravan route, which has now become the Hajj route. The district of Al-Hajar is also defined as the country lying between Mubrak-an-Naqa and Bir-al-Ghanam.— {Doughty.) HAJAR ('Aqabat-al)— See Jabal Akhdhar routes. HAJAR and KHATT HAJAR— These are ancient names which have not entirely died out but have become somewhat indefinite in their application. The accepted view is that Hajar originally referred to the oasis of Hasa and that Khatt Hajar designated the coastal tract from Ras Tanurah to Dohat Salwa and therefore included the Qatif Oasis, Barr-adh-Dhahran, Barr-al-'Oqair and Barr-al-Qarah. It is said that the whole of this littoral was once thickly populated : but now, except the Qatif Oasis, Khatt-al-Hajjar is a desert. The name is sometimes given as Khatt-al-Bahrain; and this corrobates a hypothesis, founded partly on other facts, that the name Bahrain was once applied to a part of the mainland as well as to the archipelago which now bears it.— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) HAJAR (Eastern)—* The article on the Hajar division of the 'Oman Sultanate contains a general definition of the whole tract so named ; we now proceed to describe in detail the eastern portion which we have arbitrarily separated from the rest. Limits and extent. —The Eastern Hajar of 'Oman extends about 120 miles from Wadi Samail and its tributaries on the north-west to the Jabal Khamis range on the south east, both of which it includes. Its watershed, continues with the watershed of Western Hajar to which it is linked by the Najd-al-Mughbariyah, is 50 miles distant from the coast * For authorities, maps and charts see first footnote to article Omftu Sultanate. 4172700 HA.JAR at the head of Wadi Samail and thence runs at first almost due east to a point 40 miles south-south-west of Masqat Town : beyond this place its direction is from north-west to south-east and the distance between it and the coast diminishes, being ultimately reduced at its termination near Sur to about 20 miles. The disposition of the valleys and ridges of Eastern Hajar with reference to the main axis of the range is very imperfectly understood, but it is probably less regular than in Western Hajar ; Wadi Tayin, for instance, in its upper course runs parallel to the general direction of the range instead of at right angles to it, an eccentricity which has no counter part in Western Hajar. Between Daghmar and Sur the hills of Eastern Hajar fall directly into the sea, and beyond the aspect which they present seawards nothing is known of them in this part: where they are crossed byt he route from Sur to Ja'alan they have been partially surveyed. Little is known, similarly, of the inland flank of Eastern Hajar except that it forms the boundary upon the north of the interior districts of Ja'alan and Sharqiyah. The un certainty as to the position of the inland border of Eastern Hajar makes it impossible to estimate the whole breadth of the district with accuracy, but it probably varies from 30 to 40 miles. The hills of Eastern Hajar are fairly constant in elevation from the north-west end, where they reach 5,250 feet at the head of Wadi Tayln and 6,300 feet inland of Quryat, to the south-east as far as Jabal Khadhar ; beyond this point they fall away to 2,845 feet in the Jabal Khamis range behind Sur. Configuration and features.- —The principal feature of the north-western and only explored part of Eastern Hajar in Wadi Tayin, which, running at first between two important ridges of the Hajar system, Jabal Baidah and Jabal Sauda, turns suddenly at right angles to burst through a remarkable canon and debouch on the coast at Daghmar. Immediately to the north-west of Wadi Tayln near the sea, is Wadi Bani Battash. In proceeding south-eastwards Wadi Tayin is followed, still on the seaward side of the hills, by a group of three valleys, included under the common name of Wadi Bani Jabir (1): they are Wadi Shab, Wadi Tawi and Wadi Hilam, which reach the sea at Ghail-ash- Shab, Tiwi and Kalhat respectively. The only remaining valley of importance on this side of the range is Wadi Falaij, which has its mouth near Sur, and is enclosed between the parallel ranges of Khadhar and Khamis, the two easternmost members of the Hajar system and disposed at right angles to the main range. As already remarked, the inward slopes of Eastern Hajar are practically unknown, but they are probably less^ abrupt than the outward face ; on this inner side three Wadis, called Mahram, 'Andam and Samad, run down, the last by Samad town, to the Western end of the Sharqiyah district, Wadi 'Andam (of which the other two are tributaries), eventually joining Wadi Halfain ; while Wadi Bani Khalid descends south-eastwards to the Ja'alan plain. The Eastern Hajar consists, so far as ia known, of limestone; with reference to this point the geological appendix may be consulted.

The place is really beyond the limits of Eastern Hajar, but it can not be reckoned to any other district. Names and descriptions of the principal inland places of Eastern Hajar will be found in the articles on Wadis 'Aqq, Dima, Falaij, Hilam, Bani Jabir (1), Khabbah Bani Khalid, Mansah, Saijani, Samail, Shab, Tayin and Tiwi, and in those on Jabal Khadhar! 3f1 HAJ—HAJ 703 The Bedouins of the district are Bani Bu Hasan, Hishm and Aulad Kasib: their number is uncertain. Products and animals. —-Our knowledge of Eastern Ha jar as a whole is too incomplete to admit of a general account being given of its vegetable and animal products or agri culture. The facts that are known will be found in the articles on the particular valleys and places which have already been indicated. Administration. —Except at Quryat and Sur upon the coast, the Sultan of 'Oman has at present no representatives and very little influence in Eastern Hajar: the whole interior of the district is virtually independent).— {Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) HAJAR (K hor-al-)— An inlet on the coast of the 'Oman Sultanate, 2| miles west of Ras-al-Hadd and about the same distance east of the entrance of Khor-al-Jaramah. The entrance to Khor-al- Hajar is J of a mile wide and lies between low cliffs ; the inlet runs inland for f of a mile in a south-south-easterly direction and then opens eastwards into a large shallow basin which extends for more than a mile to the east, almost reaching Hadd Town. The entrance is open to the north and its depth rapidly diminishes from 3 J to 1| fathoms while the inner basin is altogether dry at low water spring-tides. It follows that Khor- al-Hajar is of little value even for the smallest vessels and is not used except by fishing- boats. Disputes similar to those affecting Khar-al-Jaramah occurred in regard to this inlet between 1877 and 1880.—( Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.) HAJAR (W adi)— The principal valley in the south-west of Hadhramaut. It is of such importance that it gives its name to a large province. It is perhaps, the only valley in Arabia, which has a permanent river bed with water in it, which runs from its source to the sea all the year round. The source of the river is at the foot of the Jabal Ba Janaf ; the northern end only, to three or four miles below Hisn-bin-Dighail, which is some 35-40 miles from the origin of the river, is known as the Wadi Hajar. In this portion of the river two tributaries flow into it from the north, the Wadi Sharad and the Wadi Karhir. Below Hisn-bin-Dighail the stream is known as the Wadi Jiswal for about 24 miles, and from there to the sea, a distance of roughly 18 miles it is called the Wadi Maifa'a. The valley is about the most unhealthy in the whole country, and fever, dysentry, small-pox and leprosy are very prevalent. This is due to mist which rises from the water, and is so thick that a man can scarcely see anything at two paces as late as 10 o'clock in the morning. Thft principal products of the Wadi are dates and tobacco. Small quantities of wheat, Indian corn, beans, cotton, lentils and sesame are also grown.— {Von Wrede, J843.) HAJAR (Western)— This is a division, arbitrarily formed to facilitate description, of the Hajar region of the r Oman Sultanate. Boundaries and extent. —The Western Hajar district reaches from Wadi-al-Qor on the north-west to Wadi Samail on the south-east, and has thus a length of 160 miles ap proximately. Its watershed is roughly parallel to the Batinah coast and runs at an average distance of 40 miles'inland; the distance however is greater than this towards the extremities and less towards the centre where the sea-coast curves inwards slightly to wards the mountains. The boundary of Western Hajar on the seaward side is the line along which its hills subside into the Batinah plain at a distance, on the average of some 15 miles from the sea. The boundary with Dhahirah on the inland side is somewhat in definite, the decline being more gradual than on the seaward face : the valleys on this side up to their heads are generally reckoned in the district of Dhahirah; but the Hajar hills undoubtedly extend south-westward to the immediate neighbourhood of 'Ibri and Dhank Town. Including, therefore, for the moment, in Hajar the slopes which are ordinarily considered a part of Dhahirah, we may say that the Western Hajar has an average breadth of 40 to 50 miles. Configuration and general characteristics. —The physical geography of Western Hajar appears to be simple and regular. Its axis runs north-west and south-east and the valleys to which its slopes give birth run off at right angles on both sides, those on the704 HAJAR north-east to Batinah and those on the south-west to Dhahirah and 'Oman Proper. The highest portion of Western Hajar is a considerable block at the south-east end which is called Jabal Akhdhar ; Jabal Akhdhar reaches an elevation of nearly 10,000 feet, but the remainder of the range to the north-west is considerably less and at the head of Wadi-al-Jizi, perhaps the lowest point, it is only 1,860 feet. The chief valleys which run down from Western Hajar across Batinah to the sea are» in order from east to west, as follow: Wadi Tau; Wadi Lajal; Wadi Ma'awal; Wadi Bani Kharus (near the coast called Wadi-al-Qasim) with its eastern affluent WadiMistal Wadi Bani 'Auf ; Wadi Fara' or Rustaq ; Wadi Bani Ghafir (in Batinah styled Wadi-al- Hdqain) with its right bank tributary Wadi Sahtan; Wadi Mabrah ; Wadi-al-Hawasinah with its tributary from the west; Wadi Bani 'Umr; Wadi Shafan; Wadi Sarrami; Wadi 'Ahin ; Wadi-al-Hilti; Wadi-al-J zi; Wadi Bani'Umr-al-Gharbi; Wadi Hatta ; and Wadi-al-Qor. There is also a Wadi called Faidh in the neighbourhood of Shinas Town. Proceeding next from west to east along the inland slopes of Western Hajar, we find that the range sends down Wadis Dhank and Kabir to Dhahirh and Wadis Tanuf and Mi'aidin to 'Oman Proper. The Western Hajar is a limestone range and its geological character is noticed in the Appendix on geology. The Jabal Akhdhar portion is fully described under its own name : the remainder is generally very peaked and sharp ridged, with some herbaceous but very little ligneous vegetation. Trees and plants include Samar, acacia arabica. rhamnus, screw-pine, oleander, calotropis, euphorbia, caster-oil plant, wild lavender, a kind of rush called Rasal, used for mat-making, and a plant named Marannahah, bearng a fruit like a small bitter lime, of which the seeds, administered in food or drink, cause stupefaction. Birds are few in Western Hajar ; ravine deer and foxes are among the commoner animals. Villages and population. —The articles on the Wadis of Western Hajar, a list of which is given in the preceding paragraph, contain full information regarding the tribes who inhabit Western Hajar, their villages and their mode of life. To complete the topo graphy of Western Hajar we subjoin a table of places not situated in any of the better known valleys :— Name. Position. House and inhabi tants. R emarks. Buwah Tuwaiyah Between Tau and Bidbid, below a pass of the same name on the side of it next Tau. 3 miles west of Nakhl on the way to' Awa- bi. 50 houses, mostly of mud and stone, of the Bani Jabir. 80 houses of mix ed tribes, chiefly Ya'aribah. The inhabitants have 30 camels, 30 don keys, 30 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. The drainage of Tu waiyah goes towards Wadi Ma'awal. Livestock are 20 camels, 40 donkeys, 50 cattle and 700 sheep andgoats. The following is an estimate of the settled population of Western Hajar:— Souls.

The Hajarlyah district appears to be a country of high, open valleys with easy com munications from one to another. The mountains rise to a considerable height, namely Jabal Sabar, in the north, 9862 feet; Jabal Sama', 8,732 feet; and Jabal Habashi, 7,655 feet. Jabal Sabar is celebrated for its climate and fertility, and much of the best qat is grown here. Jabal-al-Qal'ah, in the Maqatirah country, is equally celebrated as an impregnable fortress on the summit of a flat-topped mountain scarped on every side. The following are the principal districts in the highlands of Hajariyah :—Jabal Sama', Qadas, Matran, Dubhan, Khadir, Muqatirah, 'Aza'iz, Athwari, and Ar-Rakab; this last includes the Qubati, Yusafiyin, and 'Absi tribes, near Mufalis and Hawaimi on the border. The principal route leading from Aden to the Hajarlyah enters the district-at Mufalisi from there the road leads westwards to Turba and northward to Ta'iz by the Naqil Hamra. Two or three miles to the north of this pass is Hirwa. The road goes on north westward, passing Ad-Dimnah in Khadir, thence up Wadi Saram and on to Ta'iz.— (Wauhope, 1915.) HAJHAIR (Jabal)— This great mass of mountains which occupies the centre of the island of Soqotra, rises to nearly 5,000 feet and ' has many jagged and stupendous peaks,' the highest of which is Jabal Bit 4,900 feet^ There are also Drait and Adouna peaks. There is no big game, except wild goats and civet cats. Quantities of wild donkeys are, however, found on the lower ground. The slopes of the mountains are rich in vegetation, of which the most notable is the dragoon's-blood tree and the Adenium and cucumber tree ; some of the valleys to the south being entirely full of frankincense trees. As these mountains catch the sea mists from all directions,' many streams flow down the valleys.— {Bent, 1894.) HAJI (A l B u ) (T ribe)— i See Hardan. HAJI-BAL-QABRAIN— A mountain in Yemen 56 miles north-north-west of Mukalla, on the Mukalla- Shibam route. It has an altitude of 4,150 feet and is the culminating point of the whole district ; from it the tableland of Al-'Aqabah slopes down gently northwards to the main valley of the Hadhramaut, and eastward towards the Wadi Adim.— {Bent, 1893.} HAJIL— A halting place in Yemen 7 or 8 miles south of Rajj.— {Hunter's Map of Arabia, 1908.) HAJlNAH (Jabal)— Three coastal hills in Hejaz, lying roughly to the northward of Ras Baridi and about 17 or 18 miles from it. It is probable that this group of hills is called Jabal Hajinah. The most westerly of these three hills, called the Sugarloaf, lies 17 miles northward of R^s Baridi, and 9 miles eastward from it; 18 miles north-eastward from the same cape is scragged hill. Between these two is Clifi Hill.—(.Bed Sea and Gulf of Aden Pillot, 1909.) HAJIR— See Daghmar.

See Wadi Maih.HAJ—HAJ 707 hajir— See Quryat. hajir— See Samail (Wadi). hajir (b ani) or huwajir— A nomadic Arab tribe of Eastern Arabia. The singular is Hajiri (Hayiri). Distribution, —The dirah of the Bani Hajir lies partly in Qatar and partly between that place and Jabrin. They are mostly found in one part or another of the Hasa Sanjaq, but they have not exclusive possession of any particular territory, excepting only a considerable portion of Qatar which is occupied by their Makhadhdhabah division; they are accustomed to obtain Rafiqa from the 'Ajman, under whose auspices they wander dispersed in the country of that tribe. The Bani Hajir sometimes camp as far south as Khor-al^Odaid, and in the opposite direction they pay occassional visits to the dominiona of the Shaikh of Kuwait; some also appear annually at 'Anik in the Qatif Oasis. Settled Bani Hajir, now altogether unconnected with the tribe, are said to be found at Wusailah in the Aflaj District and at Haraimlah and Thadiq in the 'Arldh District of Southern Najd. Arabs claiming to be Bani Hajir are found on the Persian Coast, e.g., in the Rud-hilleh District. The Bani Hajir are friends of the A1 Morrah and visit Jabrin. They own allegiance to a certain extent to Ibn Jasin, Shaikh of Qatar. They are a source of danger on the 'Ojair-Hefuf-Riyadh route. Religion, character and mode of life. —The Bani Hajir are Hanbali Sunnis. In character they are a despicable, lying and untrustworthy race ; but in their favour it is stated that they are enterprising and of a humourous disposition. Their women enjoy considerable liberty. Though they have no vessels of their own the Bani Hajir are addicted to piracy, which they carry on by means of boats temporarily seized from the coast villages of other tribes. Their principal occupations, however, are pastoral, and they live chiefly by their flocks and herds and by the breeding of horses and camels ; but they also won a number of small date groves in Barr-al-'Oqair and Barr-adh-Dhahran, and the palms at Ja'aimah in Biyadh to the north of the Qatif Oasis are their property. Their tents are generally black, or black lined with white.

The two great divisions of the Bani Hajir, namely, the Mukhadh- dhabah and the Al Muhammad, are ordinarily at enmity with one another, and this is the case at the present time ; there is consequently no paramount Shaikh of the whole tribe. It is understood that the leading men of the Bani Hajir, receiving as they do allow- ances from the Turkish Mutasarrif of Hasa and presents from the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Al Tham Shaiks of Qatar, are inclined to regard themselves as independent of all authority ; but the payment by them of Zakat to the Wahhabi Amir is regarded as a not impossible contingency of the future. About 1865 the value of their annual contribu- tion to the Riyadh treasury was estimated at $3,000.—(Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf: Leachman, 1912.)

HAJRAIN— Hajrain, the principal town in the Wadi Qasr and its collateral valleys* is built on a lofty, isolated rock situated in the middle of the Wadi Qasr about 21 miles above where it joins the main Hadhramaut valley. From a distance Hajrain, though built entirely of mud, is picturesque in appearance, and recalls to mind some of the hillset mediaeval villages of Germany and Italy. Internally, however, Hajrain is sqalid and dirty in the extreme, each street being a cess pool for the houses on both sides of it. All the houses are enormously high, and have a kitchen and oven on each floor. The bricks of which they are built are about a foot square, and have straw in them. The walls of every room are loopholed, and there are machicouli galleries over the outer doors and along the battlements. What makes the houses seem to contain even more storeys than they do is that each floor has two ranges of windows, one on the floor, so that you can only see out if you sit on the floor, and the other too high to see out of at all. Beneath every lower window projects a long wooden spout. The valleys are narrow, and the whole place a hotbed of disease. The people look very unhealthy, and when cholera comes they die like flies. The Governor of Hajrain is appointed by the Al-Ka'aiti family, but does not seem to be entirely under Makalla. The Nahadis who occupy some ten miles of the valley above Hajrain are independent and are not under Makalla at all. A very steep, winding, slippery path leads up to the gate of Hajrain. All about Hajrain are traces of the olden days when the frankincense trade flourished, and when the town of Do'an (which name is still retained in the Wadi Do'an) was a great emporium for this trade. Acres and acres of ruins, dating from the centuries immedi ately preceding our era, lie stretched along the valley here, just showing their heads above the mass of superincumbent sand which has invaded and overhelmed the past glories of this country. The ruins of certain square lofty buildings stand upon hillocks at isolated intervals ; and from these inscriptions have been obtained which prove that they were the high ' platforms ' alluded to on so many Himyaritic-inscribed stones as raised in honour of their dead. As for the town around them, it has been entirely engulfed in sand. The bed, mostly dry, of a torrent runs through the centre ; and from this fact, as also from the walls of sand on both sides of this torrent-bed, it can be ascer tained that the town itself has been buried some 30 or 40 feet by this sand. It is now called Raidoun. The ground lies strewn with fragments of Himyaritic inscriptions, pottery, and other indications of a rich harvest for the excavator; but the hostility of the Nahad tribe make this a matter of difficulty at present. At Mashhad, about 7 miles lower down the valley, there are extensive ruins of a character similar to those of Hajarain.— {Bent, 1894.) Hirsch describes Hajrain as being a not unimportant place, with a large number of houses, and a population of about 1,500 souls. Its situation, namely, where the caravan routes between Hadhramaut and the coast cross, makes it a small commercial centre and one of the more important possessions of the Ka'aiti family. Von Wrede calls this town Hadjarain, which is apparently not so correct a rendering of the name as Hajrain, or Hajarain. HAJRAT-ASH-SHAIKH— See Fara' (Wadi).

HALFAIN (W adi)— A valley in 'Oman, probably the longest in that part of Arabia. Its head is divided from the head of Wadi Samail by the Najd of MughbarTyah only, and it finally reaches the sea at Mahot: its general direction is thus south by east and its length about miles in a straight line. Five miles below the Najd, of which the elevation is 2 400 feet abive sea-level, Wadi Halfain passes Muti (2,300 feet); 7 miles further on it reaches ttJ town of Izki (2,150 feet), which it divides into two parts ; about 10 miles below Izki it passes a group of small villages belonging to the 'Awamir tribe and called collectivelv Falaj-al- Awamir some of which are described in the article on 'Oman Proper • below this point it is untenanted except by Bedouins. At Izki the right bank of the Wadi k 200 feet high; but below that town the bed opens out and becomes flat, sandy and hardlv distinguishable from the surrounding desert. It is stated, however, that after heavy rain its flood water sometimes reaches the sea at Mah5t. Wadi Mi'aidin from Jabal Akhdhar joins Wadi Halfain at no great distance below Izki: while further down, below Duh near Adam, Wadi Halfain receives Wadi Kalhn on the right bank from 'Oman Proper and, somewhere not far from Sanau.

There is no fresh water,* nor is there grazing even after rain, but some of the fishing grounds in the vicinity are excellent, and the island itself is a favourite breeding place for terns, and yield large quantities of their eggs in the season. Pearl boats call here, and fishing vessels take refuge under the lee of Halul in shamals. The best anchorage is on the south eastern side in 8 fathoms, 5 cables off-shore, but there is a considerable swell round the island in a shamal. There is a good landing-place in a gap in the low cliff to the left of a small, sandy beach on the south-eastern side. The island is surrounded by a fringe of pearl banks, and about 16 miles north by east of it is a detached pearl bank known as Najwat-bin-Hilal, or Riqqat Halul.

The tribe, which had an evil reputation for unruliness and violence, has, since the oc cupation of Kerak by the Ottoman Government some twenty years ago, been reduced to complete submission, and almost ruined by exactions. It pays £ T3,000 in taxes. The mudir of Waleh was especially appointed to take charge of the Hamaidah. They number about 700 tents, and claim descent from a common ancestor called Fadhel, who came into the Dead Sea region with Sakhr, the jidd of the Sakhur. For this reason they recognize a distant kinship between themselves and the Beni Sakhr. They are sheep- breeders, and grow crops in the fertile Kurah district. Some of the Beni Tarif are to be found at Kerak, and there are about 30 houses of Hamaidah at Buseira, east of Tafileh, under Sheikh Salim ibn Misyugha. HAMAIDAH.

The town stands on both sides of the creek, the portion on the north-western bank being, however, J a mile distant from it. The population of Hamdan is about 11,000 souls, of whom the majority are Muhaisin of the Bait Kana'an section. There are 30 to 40 houses well built of bricks and mud, but the rest of the dwellings are huts. Grazing is good and cattle numerous. Date palms are estimated at 150,000 trees, and livestock at 2,500 cattle, 1,000 sheep and goats, 40 horses and 200 donkeys. Within the Hamdan creek, and so not visible from the Shatt-al-Arab, are a tomb visited by Shi'ahs and a shrine respected by Sunnis ; the former appears to be a cenotaph, as it is admitted that the Imam Hamzah whom it commemorates neither lived nor died at Hamdan.— (Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.)

It rises in the water shed which extends south-east from the Harrat Khaibar towards the Hazam-ar-Raji plain, and appears to have its actual source some miles to the south-west of Abu Mughair on the Hail-Mecca section of the Persian Hajj route. The course of the Wadi Hamdh, which is very winding, is about 400 miles in length and has a general direction of west by north. The Wadi Hamdh passes close to the city of Al-Madmah, and between it and Jabal Ohod ; and nearly 100 miles lower down it is crossed by the Hejaz railway near Hadiyah. It reaches the coast at a point about 32 miles south of Al-Wajj, but its mouth is not well-defined and is scarcely discernible from the sea. Except after heavy rain it is dry almost throughout its entire length. The principal tributaries of the Wadi Hamdh are Wadi 'Aqlq, near Al-Madlnah, and Wadi Jizl which joins it about 30 miles to the west of Hadiyah; and in addition it receives the drainage from the western portions of the Harrat Khaibar.

HAMMAR LAKE— C , A la . g ° on j 1 ?™ 4 I » i!es across from east to west on the Euphrates between Sua ash, Sheyukh and Basrah, known to the Arabs asHAMMAR LAKE 729 The best route to it from the Tigris is via Qurnah. (For the 'route Gurmat 'Ali via the New Euphrates channel, see Gurmat 'Ali). The telegraph line follows the left bank of the river from Qurnah to Bani Hatait, thence follows the northern islands of the Hammar to A1 Miriyah and then bifurcates at the mouth of the Ma Sha'irah one branch going to Suq, and the other following the left bank to Nasiriyah. The Qurnah channel to Chibaish presents no difficulties, being easily navigable by steamers loaded to 10 feet at all seasons. It varies in width from 60 to 180 vards. Eet- b^nka^ 111 ' 118 '^ 1 an( ^ ^ m ^ es ) ( ^ ate groves alternate with reed swamps on the (See article Madinih.) For the next 15 miles, as far as the east end of Chabaish village, both banks consist s . w l ai ? a P s ' anc * throughout this reach innumerable small streams run into them. Ohabaish is a small Arab encampment or village, inhabited by Bani Asad Arabs with a small fort, and a brick house built by Shaikh Salih. In Turkish times there vas a guard of an officer and five soldiers here. The village extends in straggling fashion for some six miles m a long belt of date-palms on the left bank. During the low-water • season Chabaish forms a convenient place to tranship from river steamers into shallow draught boats. In 1915 the water at this point had begun to fall by May 13. From the east end of Chabaish to the Hammar Lake the passage is clearly defined by reeds on either side Its width is from 75 to 100 yards, and its depth, more than 9 feet m April, May and June, falls to about 4—4| feet in the low-water season. At the entrance to the Lake it shallows from 7 feet in high flood (June) to 2 feet in September October and November. In January it is about 3| feet. ' The Hammar Lake is at its highest between March and June and at its lowest between September and December. Steamer ceptains da not reckon to make the passage after June, in 1915 the maximum in the shallow channels in September and October was from 19 to 24 inches and the minimum 12 to 17. It is said at its lowest to be only shm-deep. In May 1915, the channel with the exception of the two following worst places was from 7' to 8' deep. 6 The worst places are (l)ea S t of '20-Palms ' ; (2) at and between the rightangled kick the reXof'^oha end of the Ijake - These are generally 1' 6' lower than The bottom of the Lake is composed of hard mud, with clay and broken shells bavins an overlying surface of six inches of soft mud. ^ The south bank is steep and cultivation comes down close to the channel. Cn the north bank the dry land encroaches southwards in the dry season. The channel at the east entrance to the Lake is about 200 yards wide and is marked on both sides by reeds, those to the north being thin and scattered. After proceeding for 11 miles the above-mentioned '20 Palms' (20 tall, isolated date-palms i mile south-east of Bam Hatait) are left at a distance of 700 yards north of the channel which now bends north by west, and continues in this direction for U miles running parallel to reeds on the south-west at a distance of i mile from them. ' Due west of the island of Bani Hatait the channel turns west by south for about eleven miles to Aqiqah. The width of open channel throughout this 11-mile reach is about 2 mile, and there is no clearly defined channel bed. The water shoals towards the north and south where the island villages are situated*. Northward of the northern belt of villages is a shallow mundation extending to the desert and marshes which mark the northern edge of the Lake, while the southern villages have marsh and thick reed beds to the south of them, these reed beds forming the dividing line between the Hammar Lake and the mundation of the Euphrates New channel. [At the eastern end of the Hammar Lake there is a connecting channel bed throno-h the weeds to the Euphrates New channel inundation, but this is unmarked and difficult to nnd Ihe other channel connecting the Lake and the New Euphrates nas^ W one of the islands of Abadah (Ismahin), but it is narrow and only fit for mashUuh (drawing IJ to 2 feet) in May.] . ^ masnnujs Leading out of the Hammar Lake are the following creeks and channels : ^ ^ 0 ^ Iwar ^ s Ma i ar Kabir, or Saiyid Canal which joins the Tigris at Qala'at id 9/11 xl* rfutadT S™k (B-hamah,. AI-Baish, Al- C52(w)GSB , _ OBHAMMAR LAKE (2) Northwards the Majar Saghir, or Minshad Canal which joins the Tigris ahout 3 miles north of Abu Sidrah abut 3 miles. (3) Korth-westwards the Bada'ah Canal, which, according to native information leaves the Shatt-al-Gharaf about 3| miles north of Shatrah, with a varying width of from 6 to 10 feet. At 20 miles from the Gharaf it enters an extensive marsh, and from here to Hammar Lake there is nothing to shew the correct channel and the services of a pilot are necessary. There is a bar of more than a hundred yards breadth at the northern entrance to the marsh which renders this channel practically useless as a water way, there being barely 18' of water over this bar in March 1915. At the same time there was at that time of year deep water in most of the rest of the course, although in some places as little as five feet. On the other hand, information shows that when the floods are high it is used to a certain extent. In June the journey down is described as, first, three hours in the Canal, some 30 feet wide, with desert on both banks : then one day through the marsh, followed by 5 hours' journey through a waterway nearly J mile wide, and finally 4 hours through marsh. In this case it is said that small stream launches or motors or 30-ton mahaUah* might be able to do the journey, but the services of local pilots are essential. The channel has an appreciable current flowing towards Hammar Lake. The Shatt- al-Hammar crosses the Bada'ah near its mouth approximately at right angles, 150 feet wide and 3 feet deep. It is possible to reach the Bada'ah from the Gurmah Safhah by hallam, as there are several small creeks connecting the two. (4) North-westwards, the Shatt-al-'Ajuzah or Hamzah, which joins the Shatt-al- Gharaf between Shatrah and Nasiriyah. This creek is navigable by light-draught native boats in May and June. (5) Westwards, the important channel known as the 'Aqiqah or Gurmah Safhah which leads from the Hammar Lake to the main river above Suq-ash-Sheyukh. It is more used than the Mezlik, the other western channel, as the latter is impracticable for steamers. Locally it is said that thirty years ago the 'Aqiqah channel was only a small irrigation canal which was allowed to increase in size to enlarge the cultivated area. After the completion of the 11 miles stretch across the Hammar Lake the Aqiqah mouth is reached by a course running in a northerly direction, winding through reeds for 21- miles, and leaving the mouth of the Mezlik channel and the Me/, i villages on the west. The course then turns westward into the 'Aqiqah channel, and it is at this point that the worst shallows of the whole route occur the soundings in the low season shoaling occasionally to 18'.t The channel here is some 0 yards broad, narrowing as it leads further west to about 200 yards. For some four miles it is marked on the north by a narrow belt of reeds, and on the south by thick reed beds which extend to the dry land on which are scattered the numerous reed villages and and mud towers of the district of Juwaibar. Soundings along this rea ^ beyond the bar were from 5 to 6 feet in June 1915, and from 3 to 4 feet two months later. There is a 2 to 3 knot current during flood season towards the western end. At the end of this four-mile stretch is reached what may be called the flood season western limit of the Hammar Lake, and it is near this point that the Rufai iya (a ' ballam ' creek which leaves the Ma Sha'irah four miles down the latter s course) joins the'Aqiqah. From here the course bears to the-south-west, and the channel hence forward is more commonly known as the Gurmah Safhah. The mouth of the Gurmah Safhah proper, although it is really a continuation of the 'Aqiqah, marks the western extremity of the Hammar Lake, as has been ^ remar e above. Henceforward the channel is clearly defined. It is about 180 yards wide and or five miles passes through cultivation, scattered villages and towers on both ban cs. There is plenty of water (more than S feet in July 1915) and the current runs at abou three knots in July. Three-quarters of a mile from its mouth there is an obstruction commonly known as the 'Aqiqah Dam. A navigation channel 75 feet wide has been cut through this dam, *The33 are, in ordar from east to west,— North ; Bani Hatait, Bushamiyah (Bushamah), Al-Baish, AI- Miriyah, Hawal, Guhud; South : Al-Husain, Bani Musarraf, Abadah. . tParry says that Ourmah, according to the Arabs, means ' an overflow stream.' It is worth mentioning nero for want of a better place that in August 1915 the local Arabs petitioned for the closing of the 'Aqiqan ana channels on the plea that they would otherwise be unable to irrigate their rice-crops.HAMMAE LAZE 731 the and the current runs through with great force, making it necessary for up-going steamers and boats to be hauled through with ropes. The sounding at this cutting was about 5 to 6 feet in June 1915, but it may in time scour deeper. A little way beyond the dam an irrigation channel, the Gurmah Hasan, leaves the main channel on the right bank, and half a mile further, after passing the house of Shaikh Farhud, on the same side is the Umm Madizah creek, also for irrigation. Half a mile further the Ma Sha'irah flows in on the left, leading to the Euphrates about Ij to 2 miles above the junction of the Gurmah Safhah and Euphrates. It is shallow and narrow at the mouth, and unfit for anything except mashhvfs and light draught hallams. From this point (where the Ma Sha'irah joins the Gurmah Safhah) up to Muhararaad- al-Habi (where the Gurmah Safhah joins the Euphrates) the width is 100—150 yards and the depth ample. Along this reach, after the Ma Sha'irah mouth has been left, the XJmm Barur leaves the South bank to irrigate a patch of cultivation ; and beyond this is the Bufaiyah, which is connected with the Abu Shater* which runs out of the ' Aqiqah 500 yards east of the main Euphrates. In the neighbourhood of the Umm Barur is a good landing place on the southern side. On the north bank between here and the Euphrates is the house of A. T. I., whence runs northward a long bund with a footpath. Belts of date-palms dotted with villages extend from the Ma Sha'irah to the Euphrates, and the adjacent country, although liable to inundation, is richly cultivated and fairly populous. Suq-ash-Sheyukh is about 2 miles down-stream from this point. There are no diffi culties, The river runs through palm groves on either side, and has an average breadth of 175 yards. For pilots for the Gurmah Safhah, the Bani Khaigan should be asked, and doubtless Shaikh Farhud of the Al-hasan, or Hasan Hamdani at Suq would help. (6) Westwards, the second channel to Suq-ash-Sheyukh, the Mezlik channel or Gurmah Bani Said. This channel is quite useless for Lynch steamers, but native craft nse it freely. The latter, if carrying cargo, transfer some of their load into smaller craft before crossing the bar at the mouth of the lake. This bar is from 1 to H feet less than the remainder of the channel, and if it were dug out, the Mezlik channel would form an alternative route be tween the Hammar Lake and Muhammad-al-Habi. It has the advantage for light draft not only of being shorter than the 'Aqiqah route, but also of possessing a good towing- path the whole way to Suq-ash-Sheyukh, and, in addition, the rapids at the 'Aqiqah dam are avoided. Mahailahs take about 8 hours to traverse the distance from Suq to the Hammar Lake. The entrance of the Mezlik in the Hammar Lake is difficult to find in the flood season. From the mouth to Mezlik the channel is only 25 yards wide, and the usual depth in June is from 6 to 7 feet. In the dry season this falls to as little as 2} to 3 feet, and the bar at the mouth in Hammar lake is only 15 inches in August. The bar itself is about 150 yards long and consists of soft black mud. Mezlik is a group of scattered villages on the left bank and the Juwaibar villages and towers are a little way further on, situated in a rich rice-growing area. Previous to the British occupation the Juwaibar tribe had been accustomed to take a toll of six rupees from each safinah owner, guaranteeing him in return a safe passage to Gurmah. They were also under obligation to keep the bar always dredged during the low season, an operation which they carried out by hand. From Mezlik onwards for four miles the channel deepens to seven feet but after this at the village of Gurmah (Bani Said) it shoals again. Gurmah lies on the right bank large and prosperous, with about 1,000 inhabitants, whose principal business is the export of dates, sheep, and rice. This shoal here is caused by a gravel bar 200 yards long, and 3-| to 4 feet deep in August. h ( Al- ♦Phonetic spelling, for the accuracy of which I will not vouch. The original Euphrates stream has been completly silted up below Gurmah, and only a dry bed remains which may easily be followed in its course. It leaves the Umm Nakhlah a mile below the junction of the latter with the Mezlik, and follows a line between the Bani Said and Mumanin tirbes, running almost parallel to the present Mezlik channel. It comes out into Hammar lake about a mile below the Mezlik, 6b2732 HAM—HAM One mile further on the Umm Nakhlah* leaves the Mezlik to the south-east, and half a mile upstream of this point a sunken safinah forms an obstruction, which has caused a bar to silt up with a depth of 5 feet in August. The way past it lies well in to the left bank. From here onwards to Suq-ash-Sheyukh there is ample depth of water and the channel has an average width of 175 yards. History of the ^Aqiqdh Dam tract. It appears that the 'Aqiqah Dam has always beenjbuilt on its present site in a tempor ary fashion, being constructed of Bardi (withes of reeds) and earth as soon as possible after the spring floods begin to go down, and it has been maintained as far as possible up to the reaping season. It was a common occurrence that, after the sinking of the level of the Hammar Lake, the force of the water behind the dam broke the whole dam down, and this was usually accompanied by loss of crops. The people then had recourse to the expedient, which may now be seen, of damming up the side channels to raise the level of the water. HAMMAR— See Radaif.

An island and village in the principality of Sharjah in Trucial 'Oman, 12 miles west-south-west of Ras-al-Khaimah Town. It is included in the district of Ras-al-Khaimah. The island,—about 2 miles long, parallel to the coast and very narrow,—is low and sandy, and its south-west end at low-water is nearly con- , nected with the mainlaind ; the creek between the island and the coast is shallow and can be forded in all states of the tide. On thamainland opposite are some red sand hills. The village, which is in the middle of the island, consists of about 500 houses of the Za'ab tribe and is divided into a small quarter called Umm 'Awaimir on the north and a large one called Manakh to the south. The inhabitants possess about 100 camels, 100 donkeys, 150 cattle and 500 sheep, but have no dates except at Khatt in the Jiri plain. They own about 25 pearl boats and some 10 small boats in which they bring firewood for sale to the towns of Sharjah and Deibai. They depend for their livelihood chiefly on pearl- , diving.— {Gazetteer of the'Persian Gulf.) The Umm Nakhlah channel, narrow and tortuous, although impracticable for steamers, is largely used by manailahs and ballams plying betwsen Suq-ash-Sheyukh and Gurmat 'Ali. In the dry season it is fit only for oaliams and mishhufs. In the proper season, however, the Turks were able to use it for their motor-boats. It flows out into the New Euphrates, where its mouth is narrow and difficult to find, south of the thickly- populated group of villages known as Al-Hasan.

It has its source in Jabal Tuwaiq at a point rather more than 40 miles west of Riyadh, on the usual route between that town and Qaslm. In its upper reaches it is called Wadi Haisiyah {q.v.) and is about 800 yards broad with sides 200 feet high, the valley-bed being filled with acacia, tamarisk, and tall trees. From here it runs east and some three miles below its source a large sha'ib known as A1 Khumar comes in on the left, and a little further on another one comes in on the right. The valley then opens out and at mile 12 a large sha'ib, called 'Ammariyah and containing the village of that name, comes in on the right. Here the track from Sidus comes in from the left. The valley then narrows to about 600 yards and at mile 14 the ruins of 'Ayainah in the bed of the valley are reached. Hereabouts the valley-bed is gravelly and is 20 yards broad and three feet deep, the sides being revetted with well-built stone walls to retain the water. The ruins of 'Ayainah stretch for some three miles there being a few houses of cultivators on the north bank of the valley. At mile 17 on the left bank lies the small village of Jabailah with crops and a few palms. Tne greater part of the village is in ruins but some of the inhabitants of Riyadh come here and cultivate ground. The water supply is from wells at a depth of about 40 feet. At this point the valley is about 300 yards broad, but at mile 25, where the village of Malqa stands on the left bank, it broadens out to 800 yards and then bifurcates, the two branch es encircling a cliff about 150 feet high and then re-uniting about a mile further down. The route to 'AmmarTyah leaves the valley here and runs up a small sha'ib to the -vtrest. At mile 29 is the small village of Al-Ilf with dense palm trees extending to Dara'iyah, reached at mile 32. Here the valley-bed is about 100 yards broad and gravelly. The ruins of the old Dara'iyah lie on the right bank but the site of the new town is on the left bank. The town of 'Arjah, situated in the valley-bed, is reached at mile 35. The valley, here known as Al-Batin, passes the southern end of the gardens of Riyadh at a distance of about 2 miles outside the town. From here the valley takes a south-easterly direction and becomes known as Wadi Hanifah, leaving the town of Manfuhah on the left and that of Hair on the right. There appears to be no doubt that, after passing the town of Riyadh and trending towards a point in Kharj which is some 60 miles south-south-east of Riyadh, the valley divides, the left branch running eastwards into the Dahanah where it fans out and disappears, and the right branch under the name of Wadi Sahabah, passing to the north of the Jabrln oasis and reaching the Persian Gulf south of Qatar, pfobably at Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin. Between 'Ayainah and Riyadh there are signs of flood at least eight feet up the left banks of the valley. Doughty refers to an ancient tribe called Bani Hanifah who used to live in this valley.— {Leachman, December 1912.) Next to Jabal Tuwaiq, in which it has its origin, this valley is the most important physical feature of Southern Najd, or at least of the 'Aridh district. It was formerly called Wadi Musailimah. General course. —Wadi Hanifah emerges from the main range of Jabal Tuwaiq at a point marked by a conspicuous bluff to the west of Sidus ; it appears to be formed by the union of four valleys of Jabal Tuwaiq which are, in order from north to south, Khumar, the eastern Haisiyah, Ghurur and Bodhah ; of these Haisiyah, which is thickly grown with acacia and other trees, if the best known as containing the road between 'Ayainah and Barrah, a section of one of the principal routes across Arabia. From the head of Haisiyah down to Riyadh, a distance of about 50 miles, the general direction of the Hanifah valley is east. At Malqa about 15 miles above Riyadh it apparently forks,* enclosing a small island ; and near 'lib, some 4 miles further on, the same thing occurs again. Between 'Ayainah and Riyadh, Wadi Hanifah receives three tributaries, all on its right bank ; these are Wahairish, which comes in immediately above Taraf, Ubaitah, midway between Jabailah and Malqa, and 'Ammariyah or Mazaira'ah, which contains the village of 'Ammariyah and joins immediately below Malqa. At Riyadh, or just beyond it, Wadi Hanifah turns to the south-south-east; and, after passing Hair at less than 20 miles from Riyadh, it is joined by a valley from Dhrumah and acquires the alter native name of Wadi Hair: beyond this point it receives, apparently on the borders of Kharj, a tributary named Nisah, which begins in the same part of the Tuwaiq hills aa ♦The point is obscure both in Palgraoe and Pelly. Fresh enquiry tends to show that the loop formed is import tnt, and that the island enclosed is short and liable to submersion in heavy floods. un- C52(w)GSB 60736 HANlFAH the Abaljilat valley going to Hariq. Wadi Hanifah is finally lost in the desolate Sahabah tract at a distance of perhaps 30 miles from Hair; its drainage is said to have reached the Dahanah beyond, where it disappears. Some natives of the country hold that the fresh water springs of Hasa are fed subterraneously by the drainage of Wadi Hanifah,—a theory which is at least plausible. General characteristics. —Above 'Ayainah low hills separate the Wadi on its right bank from the higher summits of Jabal Tuwaiq, while on the left bank there is a raised plateau. At 'Ayainah the bed of the valley is gravelly, and thence to Dara'iyah sandy. From 'Ayainah down as far as Malqa the general character of the Wadi is fairly uniform ; it has an average width of a few hundred yards and on either side of it there are flat-topped cliffs, alternating with low slopes, while the immediately adjacent hill crests never rise more than 200 feet above the level of its bed. From Dara'iyah to Riyadh the Wadi appears to be of a different character and to become in places at least, a scarp-sided and contracted ravine rather than an open valley. Heavy dews fall here, and there are many wells. Floods in Wadi Hanifah are said to rise 7 to 8 feet and to occur on the average four or five times in the year. After exceptionally good winter rains flowing water in the river bed may be expected to last, in the neighbourhood of Riyadh, throughout the succeed ing spring and even summer. It is full of trees and brushwood, and the lower part of it is celebrated for its luxuriant date groves ; in the upper and less frequented portion gazelle and partridges are met with. Wadi HanTfah has always been the seat of political power in Southern Najd and the successive capitals of 'Ayainah, Dara'iyah and Riyadh have all been situated upon it. It was the scene of great carnage when the forces of Islam overran the Peninsula.

The village lands are on both sides of the Wadi. Numerous wells 12 fathoms deep yield fresh water, but the level of the Wadi bed is too low to admit of irrigation from them The name is due to the separation of Wadi Hanifah at this point into two branches which, re unite, further down.

A small cliff with a slightly overhanging top at the head of Hanyurah Bay, and at the southern end of a little tableland 20 to 30 feet high, can be seen from a distance of about 7 miles, and is a mai k for the bay. From Ras Hanyurah the coast trends south-westward 24 miles to a point about 2J miles south- westward of Abu Dhabi fort, and is fronted by the Hadd-ath-Thalai, an extensive reef which commencing a little way north-eastward of Ras HanyCrah, extends 1J miles off that headland. Its outer edge then trends west-south-westward 8 miles, when it is about 5 miles from the land, and then turns south-south-westward, joining the reef off Abu Dhabi. There is a depth of from 5 to 6 fathoms close off the reef, and the lead is not a good guide when approaching it as the depths are irregular.

A great Arab tribe, mostly nomadic, found in the Hijaz province and on the western confines of Najd. According to Palgrave, they trace their descent back to the Qahtan, Rabia', and Mudhair. Distribution. —Part aside between Makkah and Madinah within the basin of the Red Sea, others to the south of Khabar about the head of Wadi-ar-Rummah and that of Wadi-al-Hamdh which goes down to MadTnah ; the remainder, with whom we are chieflv concerned, inhabit the country upon the upper course of Wadi-ar-Rummah and the tract called Hazam-ar-Raji to the south of it, sometimes pushing as far east as Dilaimiyah, Ab-ad-Dud and Subaih in Qasim and as 'Aqlah, Balazlyah, Fuwarah and 'Odhaim in Jabal Shammar. Harb Bedouins are occassionally seen in 'Aridh. Settled Harb are found at Barrud in Wadi-as-Sirr, at Zilfi in Sadair, and at Rghabah in 'Aridh ; and some of the inhabitants of permanent villages in Qasim claim to be of Harb descent, especially at Basr, Bukairiyah, 'Ain-Ibn-Fahaid, Hamar, Hilaliyah, Jau'i, Qaryah, Quwai'ah, Mu- raid Saiyid, Nabhaniyah, Shaihiyah, Shiqqah, Subaih and Ummahat-az-Ziyabah. The Bedouins who adjoin the Harb in Najd are the Hataimupon the north, the Mutair upon the east and the' Ataibah upon the south-east and south. Divisions and number. —The Harb tribe consists of two main divisions, the Masruh and the Bani Salim. The subdivisions of the Masruh are three, the Bani 'Ali, the Bani 'A^ir, and the Bani- as-Safar ; these again are composed of the sections given below :— * Bani ''Ali sub-division of the Masruh. 'Abidah. Karashif. Dahaim. Kitimah Dawa'irah. and Kalakhah Turafah. The Bani 'Ali section of this tribe live entirely to the east and north-east of Qasim and are friendly with the Shammar, the two being often seen camping together. {Leachman.) ♦Doughty received an almost entirely different statement (II. 513). those in Hijaz. C52(w)GSB Possibly the sections he mentions are 5d '746 HAEB Some of them are 4c pithless day-sleepers and coffee-drinkers' ; some are ultra- religuous ; others on the contrary are unable to say their prayers, and not all keep Ram- dhan. Some of the Bani 'Ali pitch their tents in a circle and keep their animals in the middle, an unusual form of camp among the Bedouins of Central Arabia. The ruling family of the whole Masruh division belong to a sub-section of the KarashTf called Furom, Bani * Arm sub-division of the Masruh. 'Atur. Sha'afin. Bidarln. Shiddah. Ghiyadln. and Sha'ab. Sillah. Bani-as-Safar sub-division of the Masruh. 'Auf, Makhallaf. Faridah. Wahob. The 'Auf are reputed robbers, especially of pilgrims, but in reality only part of the section engage in enfarious practices. The sub-divisions of the Bani Salim are two only, the Maimun and the Mizainah. The Salim appear to be as a rule honest, kindly, hospitable, and, for Bedouins, well clad. Their sections are :—* Maimun sub-division of Bani Salim. Ahamidah. Salaim (Aulad). Gharban, Wasadah Hanishah. and Jimlah. Zighaibat. Maizainah sub-division of the Bani Salim. 'Araimat. HawamiL Bishariyah. Hawazim. Dhawahirah. Husnan. Hananiyah. Kahaitah. Of these the 'Araimat have no camels, but only sheep ,' and the Hawazim,f wno are perhaps not true Harb, are taunted by their enemies with being Saluba or Hataim, and are sometimes described as Ibadhi in religion like the tribes of the 'Oman Sultanate. Leachman says that the Hawazim are not Harb but are of the nature of Salaib {q. v). The settled Harb of Zilfi are said to belong to a section called Bani Hammad. The numbers of the Harb are difficult to estimate, but those in Najd may be placed at about 3,500 souls. Livelihood and character. —The Harb are camel and sheep-owners ; their camels are nearly all swarthy or black, and some of their sheep are black also. A number of the tribe are professional robbers and highwaymen, and others acts as escorts to pilgrims caravans passing through their country. In complexion the Harb are extremely dark, but they have the features of true Arabs. In religion they are Hanbali Sunnis ; in character and disposition they seem to vary considerably from section to section ; many of the poorer Harb live among the Hataim, but they abstain from intermarriage with them. The Harb are not as yet a well-armed tribe ; their weapons are still for the most part muzzle-loading guns, flint-locks and spears ; such rifles as they possess have been imported through Yanb5 on the Red Sea. Political position. —As the greater part of their territory and nearly all their immov able property are in Hijar, where they have a number of fixed villages, the political rela tions of the Harb with the Turks are necessarily close. The Bani Salim division and the Bani 'Amr sub-division are subsidised by the Turkish Government in consideration of their keeping Open the various pilgrim routes through the Harb Dirah but the susbidy is really paid by the pilgrims in the form of tolls collected at Makkah by the Turkish authorities on behalf of the Harb. The Damascus Haj j is severely taxed for this purpose, that from Hail less so, the Qaslm Hajj escapes still more cheaply, and that from Riyadh is altogether exempt. The Harb who live in Najd beyond effective Turkish jurisdic tion were in the beginning tributaries of the Wahhabi ; but in 1864 they allied themselves to the Ataibah, then hostile to Ibn Sa'ud. In 1878 they were subject to taxation by Ibn Rashid and used to be periodically collected by his order at Samirah for military an revenue purposes. They have lately returned to their original allegiance and ♦Doughty's account differg considerably from this (II 512) ISee the footnote to the article on the A wazim.0) HABB 747 render annual tribute to the Wahhabi Amir at the rate of one sheep or goat in every 50 and one dollar in cash on every 5 camels ; the total value of their present annual contri bution has not been ascertained. The Harb are subject to Ibn Rashid (1912), One section, living towards Mecca, are Shi'ahs but their names have not been properly ascertained.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer j Leachman)* According to Doughty the sections of the Harb are as follows :— Bani Salim:— El-Mo'ara, Weled Selim. Bani Tamim, (not the Najd nation.) Es-Sa'adin, El-Huazim and El-Hejella Eth-Thoahirra, Mozayna. El-Henneytat» El-Jemella, El-Jerajera. El-'Ubbeda, El-Juabcrra. Bani 'Aly (Shaikh- al- Furn).

Bani Ass'm, Bani ^Amr (of the Ferr'a, not those of Bani Salim), Doughty's system of transliteration has been retained throughout these lists which r it will be observed, differ considerably from those given by the Persian Gulf Gazetteer- Burton gives two fendies, named Sumaydah and Mahamid, of the Hamidah, which, latter he calls the principal family of the Bani Harb Bedouins. Another authority describes the Harb as follows :— The Harb are Ahl es-Shimal. They are a powerful and warlike tribe of the Hejay and of Nejd occupying, the coast of the Red Sea from Yambo to Kunfida, the mountain country between Medina and Namas (a Turkish post on the southern border of the Hejaz) and the desert to the north-east up to Jebel Abanat. Inland, their country extends just across the Wady Rumma. On the south they push down to the Shai'b el-Asibiyat and the Harrat Kishb, the vicinity of the caravan road from Boreida to Mekka, if the Ateiba are in their southern pastures ; but this country is really dira of of the latter. In the days of the Emir Mohammed of Hail, the eastern Harb paid tribute to the Rashid ; but they are now independent. The clans in the Hejaz come under the in fluence of the Sherif, though they pay him tribute only when it suits them. They are responsible for the safety of the southernmost section of the Hejaz Railway, but their counexion with the pilgrim traffic is chiefly of a less respectable kind ; for they rob, caravans on the Mekka road, kill and plunder stragglers, and extort money at every opportunity. Their Auf and Lehaba clans are noted highwaymen, much dreaded by the pilgrimage. The Harb of the Hejaz (Beni Salim and Masruh) are mostly cultivators, fishermen, and carriers. The Beni Salim are also camel-breeders, and so are the Nejd clans of the Beni Amr ; but none of the Harb are specially rich in camel herds. They are divided into three big sub-tribes. The Beni Salim live in the Hejaz, though there is a small branch of the M^zeinat in the south-east parts of Sinai. The Subh, one of their sub-tribes, are almost entirely nomad and have a reputation for bravery and valour. The other sub-tribes are half settled, half pastoral, with the exception of the Kuwwad, a tribe of menials, camel-drivers, and negroes, divided between the Beni Salim and the Masruh. The chief Sheikhs of the Subh are Khalil el-Ahmad, who is 25 years old, and Sherif Ibn Nami, a man of 60. 5d2748 HAEB The Beni Amr own the date-growing district of Fur' near Medina, but their principal Sheikh, El-Zuweibi, is generally in Nejd. He is about 18 or 20 years of age, a strong partisan of the Sherif. The sub-tribe of the Jahm are Shiahs. The Masruh have charge of the caravan road and hold Rabigh. A big sub-tribe, the Zobeid, are fishermen and sailors along the coast from Jidda to Yambo. Mostly settled in villages, they are of a stock despised by purely nomadic Arabs. Their paramount Sheikh, Hussein ibn Mubeirek, lives at Rabigh. His territory extends from Mastura in the north to Kuliya in the south. He is on excellent terms with the Sherif, and in constant communication with him. The Beni Isa are scattered farther south on the borders of Yemen. A large group of the Zobeid is established in Mesopotamia, where they are cultivators and, herdsmen. The Beni Ali, at Medina, are a turbulent confederation, bitterly hostile to the Turks. They are at present strongly influenced by the Sherif, and are used by him to keep the town in a state of unrest and disorder. They are a much rougher people than any of the Beni Salim, and are sometimes said not to be of the Harb race. The paramount Sheikh of the Thuwa Hasan lives at Lith, where there is a Kaimmakam and a Turkish post. The Beit Ali round Kunfida, where there is also a Turkish post, were formerly followers of the Idrisi, but now follow the Sherif, Tribe. Sub-Tribe. Clan. B eni S alim. 2,000 tents or more.

When he is in the Hijaz his pasturing grounds are round Abu Mughair, 5 days from Madinah, marked in Hun' ter's map. He is paramount over the powerful Masruh division of the Harb or at any rate over a large part of it of which the leading sections are as follows (their present position as stated):— Bani 'Ali ,, ., Muhsin al Firm ., Sa'id al Dhicheri Maharib ibn Mujid sa,,* J Saqr ibn Khurais •' 'Ali al Milhis ..

All the Masruh are at present gom (at feud) with Ibn Rashid on account of Muhsin's alliance with us. They look on Ibn Sa'ud as an ally. Ibn Rashid is apparently making it pretty hot for the sections in the Hamad near the borders of his country and the Qasim. He fell recently upon the Firidah and took chisab (booty) from them. (We heard of his attackmg some of the Harb.) According to Nadhi, he is driving them out of their accustomed pastures (' taradna ' he said). Letters have passed between Muhsin and the Shaikhs in the south, in which Muhsin has described the favourable treatment he is receiving from the English Government and has urged them to come up ??tiT f They u a : e anxi0US t0 do 80 alld wil1 P robabl y move up with the first rains! It looks as if we might expect a large migration of Masruh towards the frontiers of the Iraq and the interesting question arises as to whether the Sharif will lay any claim to their allegiance when here, or to Nikat.

It is known to the Shihuh tribe as Tutuh, • • '*»&gt;• •-»- Boundaries and physical features.—On the north Hariq is divided fro™ a -754 HARIM called Hilaiyah, which is interposed between it and part of the Hautah district. The fall of the Hariq valley appears to be from west to east, and its drainage is reported to join that of Hautah upon its way to Kharj. Jabal 'Alaiyah, already mentioned, is an important physical feature connected with this district and with Hautah ; it is uncertain whether it pertains to the Tuwaiq system or is an isolated range. It is described as enclosing a basin of which the drainage es capes by a fissure called Sha'ib 'Alaiyah in the eastern side of the mountain; in the north western part of the basin is a locality named Mawan where there are wells 4 fathoms deep and date groves at which Bedouins assemble in the season to gather the fruit. Jabal 'Alaiyah is reported high and difficult and is said to contain a number of strong holds, which are called Qaranlyah or Quruniyah and are occupied by robber bands composed of the off-scourings of many of the tribes of Arabia, A part of Jabal 'Alaiyah apparently projects southwards into the Harlq valley, for it is crossed im mediately after leaving Hariq town on the way from that place to Dilam in Kharj.* Communications. —Routes radiate from Hariq town to Dilam in Kharj, to Hair on Wadi Hanifah, and to the village of Jau-as-Saibani which is described in the article on Dhrumah. The route to Dilam goes east with a slight southerly inclination ; the journey occupies a caravan 10 or 11 hours and the distance may be about 30 miles. The first 3 hours are spent in ascending and then descending a portion of Jabal 'Alaiyah; thereafter the route runs through a plain where neither villages nor torrent beds are encountered. It is also possible to go from Hariq to Dilam by descending the Hariq valley to its junction with the valley of Hautah and thence following the Hautah valley to Dilam : on this route also no villages are passed. The route from Hariq to Hair is identical with the first route to Dilam until the cross ing of part of Jabal'Alaiyah has been effected and the south-eastern corner of the moun tain is reached ; it then diverges northwards, 'Alaiyah for some time remaining on the left hand. A waterless stage which is reckoned half way to Hair is reached in 10 cara van hours ; it is named Ausat from a hill that adjoins it on the west. Unless, however, the road is very winding, it does not appear that the journey can amount to so much as 60 miles. k The route from Hariq to Jau-as-Saibani runs for 8 hours through hilly ground, Jabal 'Alaiyah being on the right-hand side of the traveller, to the hill of Faraishah; thence the way continues westwards for 5 hours over a level plain to Jau-as-Saibani. The times being those taken by a caravan, the total distance is probably between 30 and 40 miles. At 3 hours short of Jau-as-Saibani on the south side of the route is Khashm-adh- Dhib which is regarded as the north-westernmost corner of the hills of Hariq and is the furthest point reached by the torrent of Abaljilat from 'Aridh.

The place contains a number of upper storeyed houses; timber for building is obtained locally and not imported. The water supply and crops are the same as at Hariq town, but the date planta tions are neglected and the place is going to decay. The founder, a certain Muhammad bin Husain, is dead and the village is in the possession of his three sons with their families and servants. There are consider able date plantations. Agricultural condi tions are similar to those prevailing at Hariq town. There are some wells I at this place. There are the remains of a Qasr and some 5 e 2756 HAR—HAE ♦ Name. Position.

It will be observed that among the genuine Arab villagers of the Hanq district 'Ani- zah of the Ruwalah section predominate, but the inferior tribes who are grouped to gether under the designation of Bani Khadhir are probably more numerous than they. The whole settled population of the Hariq district probably does not exceed 4,000 souls. It is believed that Hariq was once more thickly peopled than it is now; local opinion attributes the decline to the Egyptian invasions. The valley is noted for the excellence of its fruits. The revenue which Hariq at present yields to the Wahhabi Amir is esti- mated at $. 5,000 a year. HARlQ (W adi)— See Hautah; boundaries and physical features.

HASA OR AHSA OASIS*— This and the Qatlf Oases are the only fertile and well watered tracts inthe Sanjaq of Hasa ; and of the two the Hasa Oasis, now under consideration, is by far the more valuable and important. Boundaries, extent and position. —The Hasa Oasis has its north-western corner at Jabal Qarat-ar-Rukban and its south-western corner at Jabal Bu Ghanimah, while its southern boundary runs from Jabal Bu Ghanimah to Jabal Arba' and'thence for several miles further to the e&amp;st; on the remaining sides the borders of the district are not precisely defined by conspicuous features. With these limits its extent is about 35 miles from north to south, and its breadth may be taken at 20 miles. The Hasa Oasis is enclosed by the desert tracts of Ghuwar on the west, Kharmah on the south, and Biyadh on the east and north ; at Jabal Qarat-ar-Rukban it touches Badd-al-AsIs, and on its opposite or south-eastern extremity it meets Jafurah. The town of Hafuf, of which the position is well ascertained, is situated in the district near its south-western corner : and the eastern border of the oasis approaches within about 30 miles of the Persian Gulf coast at the port of'Oqair. Physical features and climate.—It should be clearly understood that although the whole is spoken of as Hasa, only a portion of the district just defined is cultivated or permanently inhabited. The greater part of it is in fact merely desert, except perhaps, between Qaran and ' Ahun, where it is marshy. The chief block of cultivation is in the south, to the east of the towns of Mubarraz and Hofuf ; it does not extend much further north than the first of these, and southwards it hardly reaches beyond the second and does not cross to the south of the Hofuf-Jishshah road until near Bab-al-Jafar; its extreme length from west to east does not exceed 12 miles. Besides this block there are 2 or 3 detached areas of cultivation, but in comparison with it they are ^ insignificant; and, when in the following paragraphs mention is made of limits of cultivation, the phrase is to be taken as referring to the limits of the main block. Of the cultivated areas the nearest to the main block is one which adjoins the west side of Sha'abah ; it is separated from the cultivated country to the south of it by a narrow belt of stony, waste land, across which water for irrigatian is brought in deep-lying channels. This patch is about 2 miles north of Mubarraz; and 2 miles further, in the same direction, a somewhat larger one occurs which contains the villages of Matairah, Jalaijilah, Qaran and Qarain and possesses springs of its own. The lands of 'Ayun village compose the largest and most isolated of the minor cultivated areas, for they cover a space of perhaps 4 square miles and the nearest part of them is about 15 miles north of Mubarraz ; in connection with these may be mentioned a small patch of cultivation at Qattar, which is 6 miles further to the northward but belongs to the same owners as 'Ayun. The hills of Qarat-ar-Rukban, Bii Ghanimah and Arba', inasmuch as they lie on the borders of the oasis and are common to it and other districts, are described in the general article on the Hasa Sanjaq. Eminences actually included within the district are few and unimportant. The nearest to Hofiif is a mound called Abul Kubari about 1^ miles north-east of the town; and the largest is Jabal Qarah, which lies 6 miles east- north-east of Hofuf, covers a considerable area, and has at its base upon different sides the villages of Qarah, Dalwah, Taimiyah and Tuwaithir : Jabal Qarah consists, partly at least,of sand stone rocks weathered into fantastic shapes, and it contains roomy caves which are used as dwellings in the hot weather. The only hill of importance besides Jabal Qarah is Jabal Buraijah also called Jabal Sha'abah; it is a high ridge running eastwards for perhaps a mile from the village of Sha'abah which is situated at the foot of it. Mention may also be made of some hillocks a mile to the south-east of Jishshah which are known as Talul-ad-Duwwar. The aqueous feature of the oasis, such as springs, streams and lakes are noticed in the paragraph below on irrigation. ♦The principal authorities, maps, etc., relating to this tract are first footnote to the title of the article on the Hasa Sanjaq. included amonS those mentioned in the760 HA8A The Hasa mountains reach an elevation of 1,400 feet above sea level, their main compo nents are granite and sand stone with occasional quartz, basalt and limestone. Pal II 136-7. The elevation of Hasa above the sea has not been observed; but it is certainly not great. The general slope of the oasis, to judge from the flow of the springs, is down wards from west to east; but in the northern portion, to the south of 'Ayun, there appears to be descent northwards as well as eastwards. The soil is light and inclines to sandiness; but though barren saline patches occur arbitrarily here and there, it is generally fertile. A multitude of springs exist, all of which are more or less warm and some of which are extremely hot; they probably represent, along with those of Qatif and Bahrain, the drainage of Najd eastwards which disappears on reaching the Bahanah desert. Running waters fed by the springs abound, especially on the east side of Hofuf ; in places the roads run upon embankments through deep, saturated country ; and in some localities there are marshes and large stagnant ponds, the most notable being Birkat-aMsfar. Natural grass is plentiful in spring; reeds and rushes grow in the swamps ; and among wild trees the tamarisk and the sidar or ber are the most common. The climate of the Hasa Oasis is not favourable to physical activity or to health* but it is colder, drier and less relaxing than that of Qatif or Bahrain. Population, —The people of the Hasa Oasis are partly nomads and partly settled towns men and villagers. The Bedouins are dealt with elsewhere in the article on the Hasa Sanjaq, and here we have only to do with the fixed inhabitants, who are called in Arabic Hasawlyah. Among the Hasawlyah little stress is laid on tribal divisions, and the principal distinction observed is that of religion, between Shi'ahs and Sunnis. The total sedentary population of the oasis, the towns of Hoful and Mubarraz being included, may be placed at 67,000 souls, of whom 25,000 (three-fourths Sunnis) inhabft the town of Hofuf and 8,500 (four-fifths Sunnis) that of Mubarraz. Of the 33,500 persons living in the 35 other towns and villages of the oasis, it appears that almost exactly f are ShI'aha and J Sunnis ; but the Sunnis generally preponderate in the larger of these country places. Both sects have schools at Hofuf, and the Sunnis have small schools in some of the larger Tillages as well, but the Shi'ahs have none outside of the capital. It may be mentioned, notwithstanding the unimportance in Hasa of differences other than those of religion, that most of the Shi'ahs probably belong to the race known as Baharinah, being so regarded by the people of Qatif and Bahrain though not, perhaps, so styled by themselves ; and that among the Sunnis there are included a few of the class called Huwalah. The Baharinah, notwithstanding the name and their undoubted racial identity with the original inhabitants of Bahrain, as proved by the existence among them of some of the same family divisions, appear to be indigenous to Hasa and not to be immigrants even of old standing. It is said that a Sabian community once existed but if so it has now disappeared. Negro slaves are fairly numerous and for statistical purposes have not been distinguished from their owners, whose form of religion—whether Shi'ah or Sunni—they usually follow. It is reported that in the villages of the oasis nearly every male adult possesses a rifle.

Except in the town of Hofuf, where there are wells, water for drinking is gen erally taken from the springs which irrigate the date groves. Irrigation. —The most remarkable features of the oasis are unquestionably its water- supply and the utilisation of the same for agriculture.

The water of Umm Saba' is distributed among the villages of Matai- rafi, ShaqTq and Qarain and reaches to 'Ayun, See Marjan above, A river-like torrent formed by the commingling of the surplus waters of many springs. At first it flows east in a single channel, has a strong current, and is 30 to 40 feet wide and very deep; as it passes Bani Na'am village, however, on the north side, it divides into two branches known as Nahr Salai- sil and Nahr Daughani. Of these the latter, which is the more southerly, waters all the south-eastern villages of the Hasa Oasis; it appears to be about 10 feet broad and 2 or 3 feet in depth, Nahr Salaisil on the other hand passes close to the south of Jabal Qarah, and branches of it even run round that hill to Halailah and other villages; so much of its water as is not expended in irrigation finds its way into the Birkat-al-Asfar. A spring which may be taken as marking the south-eastern most limit of the Hasa Oasis. A few date trees adjoin it and a village is said to have existed formerly. A spring. Do. The irrigation channels leading from the springs to the fields continually cross one another by means of aqueducts, and the result is a very complex network of waterways. Each spring is the separate property of one or more villages. The water seems to be ample for the cultivated land, and much of it even runs to waste. Each plot of land has had from time immemorial a regular water-supply from a particular spring 6g2772 HASA attached to it, which is reckoned by hours of flow ; the distribution of water conse quently follows that of land and not hereditary tribal shares or any other scheme of division. Water rights cannot be sold apart from land, for the two are indissolubly connected and are necessarily transferred together. The water is not subject to taxation, being regarded as u Mai Allah, ' or a netural benefac tion free to all who are landholders. Small striped or speckled fish exist in the stream. Agriculture and livestock. —The cultivated parts of Hasa are a mass of date planta tions interspersed with rice fields : every village possesses some date groves. The dates are the most valuable .product of the oasis and are considered by the Arabs of the Persian Gulf to be the best in the world superior to those of Basrah and 'Oman; about J are of the most steemed variety styled Khalas, and J are of the kind called Razaizi. The average annual date crop of the Hasa oasis has been estimated at 51,000 tons. Besides dates some rice is cultivated ; also lucerne and a ' sour grass '— possibly a sorrel—called Rashaidi. Wheat and barley are raised, part of the barley being grown in winter without irrigation, in the desert portions of the oasis where there are semi-perma nent Bedouin encampents ; but the cereals produced are not sufficient even for local consumption. Sugar and indigo are not seen. The fruits of the oasis include the citron, peach, apricot, fig, pomegranate, grape, sweet lime and sour lime : and there are also, common vegetables such as radishes, onions and gkrlic, but both fruits and vegetables are of poor quality. The chief domestic animals are cattle, sheep, donkeys, horses and camels : despite the swampy character of the country and its political connection with Turkish 'Iraq there are nQ, buffaloes. Cattle are abundant, and there is said to be on the average a cow to every house ; but sheep, which belong chiefly to the Bedouins, are not so plentiful as in Najd. The donkeys which are in possession of the villagers, are estimated to number about 3,000 of the famous white Hasa breed and about 10,000 of ordinary breeds. Horses owned by villagers are about 100. Communications, transport and supplies. —The main routes which traverse the Hasa Oasis are described in the article upon the Hasa Sanjaq. Here it may be added that travellers proceeding northwards from Hofuf do so by way of 'Ain Hamadah and the Barr or desert to the westward, avoidinag the cultivated country. Reliable estimates of the transport and supplies available in the oasis are not avail able, but a rough indication of the nature and extent of its resources is contained in the foregoing paragraphs. Manufactures and trade. —These subjects are dealt within the article on the Hasa Sanjaq except the trade in dates, the nature of which is explained by the following table:— Quantity in tons. Disposal. Remarks. 3,000 Exported to Jiddah via 'Oqair The passage from 'Oqair to Port and Basrah. Basrah is by sailing boat.

For local consumption in Qatar. 40,000 Locally consumed in the Hasa Oasis sold to Bedouins or exported overland to Najd, Kuwait, etc. None of the dates exported from the Hasa Oasis are boiled dates.4i2] HASA 773 HASA D istrict*— A district situated on the coast of Eastern Arabia between the Kuwait Principality on the north and the promontory of Qatar and the Jafurah desert on the south ; on the east it is bounded by the sea, and on the west by the tract known as Summan. Boundaries and natural divisions. —On the north the boundary of the Sanjaq begins at Jabal Manlfah upon the coast and runs inland westwards to the Na'airiyah hill; then, changing its direction to south-west, it passes by the ? Udumat hill to the north end of the Abu Dhahair ridge. The western boundary is marked by Jabal-al-Taff throughout the length of that range, and beyond by a line joining the south end of Jabal-al-Taff to Jau-ad-Dukhan. From Jau-ad-Dukhan the boundary runs first north east by Qusur Bin- 'Ajlan to the south-eastern corner of the Hasa Oasis ; then eastwards ; and finally south-eastwards to the foot of Salwa bay. The administrative divisions of the Sanjaq will be mentioned further on, but the present is a suitable place in which to enumerate the various natural tracts, having distinctive names, of which the region is composed; each of these has a character more or less peculiar to itself, and each forms the subject of a separate article in this Gazetteer, which may be consulted for details concerning it. The order of these tracts upon the coast from north to south is;—Zor-al-Audhan, Huzum, Biyadh, Qatlf Oasis, Barr-adh- Dhahran, Barr-al-'Oquair and Barr-al-Qarah. The tracts upon the landward frontier in succession are :—on the north Sabakhat-al-Mutaya, Radaif and Wadi-al-Miyah ; on the west, Wadi-al-Miyah, Habl, Taff, Wadi Faruq, Na'alah, Ghuwar, Kharmah, the Hasa Oasis (at its south-east corner), Biyadh and Barr-al-Qarah. The tracts in the interior which do not at any point reach to the circumference are Sanfan-al-Hanna and Jau Shamin south of Radaif, and Jau-as-Sa'adan, Badd-al-Asis and Jauf to the north east and north of the Hasa Oasis. The Sanjaq, it will be seen, consists of no less than 22 : separate natural divisions ; of these all are desert with the exception of the two oases and, to a certain extent, of Wadi-al-Miyah. Besides these tracts on the mainland, the islands of Musallamiyah, Jinnah, Janah, Abu 'Ali Jaraid and Tarut,—all separately described, — must be taken to be included in the Hasa Sanjaq, Physical features. —As a whole, the region is one of sandy or earthy deserts, containing numerous shallow wells of drinkable water and a fair quantity of grazing and therefore habitable by Bedouins. Here and there the surface is broken by isolated hills ; such of these as belong entirely to one tract are described in the article on the tract, while the remainder, situated on boundaries and common to more than one tract, are dealt with in the general table below Name.

Springs, streams and lakes occur only in the Hasa and Qatif Oases, in the articles on which they will be found. The depth of the water level has been indicated, so far as possible, in the articles on the numerous desert tracts. The climate is warm and in the oases moist also ; more rain, it is said, falls than in Bahrain, and some food grains are even raised near the Hasa Oasis without recourse to artificial irrigation. Inhabitants, —-The following is an estimate of the population of the whole Sanjaq,' distinguishing between villagers (or townsmen) and Bedouins, according to such informa tion as is available Settled population.

Conversely the 'Awazim and Rashaidah, although they wander to some extent in Hasa, have been excluded from the table because their permanent headquarters and proper locations are in Kuwait territory; and certain Bedouin tribes of Najd—such as theDawasir, Sahul, Mutair, Sabai', 'Ataibah and Qahtan, who are represented by camps in Hasa in the hot weather,—have been similarly treated. The Baharinah —who form nearly the entire population of the Qatif Oasis, compose perhaps y or more of the population of the Oasis of Hasa and occupy Tarut island, but are not found elsewhere—are the chief racial ingredient in the settled population : their number may amount to 58,000 souls. The next most considerable element is the settled portion of the Bani Khalid, about 4,500 persons, chiefly on the islands of Musallamiyah, Jinnah and Tarut, at Qasr-al-Subaih, and at Kalablyah and Jishshah in the Hasa Oasis and Umm-as-Sahak in the oasis of Qatif. In Wadi-al-Miyah there are about 1,000 miscellaneous Arabs, drawn from the 'Ajman, 'Awazim, Bani Khalid, Mutair, Rashidah and Shammar tribes ; and these, with a few Bani Yas and Sadah on Tarut Island and still 'fewer Huwalah at Qatif Town and in the Hasa Oasis, complete the tale of the settled inhabitants. Negro slaves, who are fairly numerous, have been included, for statistical purposes, in the tribes and communities by whom they are owned. There was formerly a flourishing though fluctuating community of Hindu traders, British C52(w)GSB 5 h m778 HASA subjects, unaccompanied by their families, at Qatlf Town j but it has now disappoared, for reasons which are explained in the article on that place. The distribution of the Bedouin tribes of the Sanjaq is explained in detail in the articles under their names ; to speak generally, the Bani KMlid are located in the north, and the A1 Morrah to the south, with the Bani Hajir between them towards the coast and the 'Ajman between them in the interior. The inhabitants of the Sanjaq are heavily armed, and it is reported that, in the villages of the Hasa and Qat'f Oasis, nearly every male adult possesses a rifle. When the arms trade was permitted in Bahrain rifles were easily obtained thence ; now they are mostly smuggled in through Qatar. Agriculture and livestock. —Agriculture is practically confined to the oases of Hasa and QatTf, in the articles on which irrigation and crops are described. Here it may be repeated that dates, which are excellent and plentiful, are the chief staple; but rice, wheat, barley and a considerable variety of fruits and vegetables are also grown. Cattle and donkeys are owned in considerable numbers by the villagers of both oases; but camels, horses and sheep are chiefly in the possession of the Bedouins. Transport, —A proportion of the donkeys in the oases of Hasa and Qatlf are excellent and belong to the white indigenous breed now found also in Bahrain ; their good quality is attributed to the dates and lucerne on which they are fed. The price of donkeys per head ranges from 10 to 150 Riyals and the total number in the two oases is esti mated at 3,200 of superior, and 10,650 of inferior breeds ; but it is not probable that the owners could spare more than a small proportion of either class from field labour and other necessary employments. Of the number of horses and camels either existent or available among the Bedouins no estimate is possible ; in the two oases, there are said to be about 150 horses (chiefly mares). The horses vary from the pure-bred Arab, difficult to obtain and fetching a very high price, to the common Kadish or baggage horse. A large number of hardy and serviceable animals, showing some breeding, may be had at prices ranging from 20 to 40 Llrahs; and the Turkish Dhabitiyahs, who used to be mounted on horses of this stamp, were said to have per formed journeys of 100 miles in 3 days with ease. Good riding camels, inferior only to those of 'Oman, are numerous, as are also ordinary baggage camels; but a well-bred riding camel costs on the average 20 Llrahs, and frequently much more. Natural products. —The products of the Sanjaq are chiefly agricultural, from the oases, and pastoral from the surrounding deserts ; their nature will become apparent in considering the question of exports. Pearl fisheries. —On the coast pearl fishing is carried on to some extent; it employs 167 boats and affords occupation to about 3,500 men. The average crew of a pearl boat in Hasa is about 21 men. Manufactures. —The only industry of importance in Hasa is a manufacture of 'Abas which has its seat at Hofuf ; the material used is generally all wool, but mixtures of silk and wool and of silk and cotton are also employed ; the finished article is some times embroidered with gold or silver thread. There are also some expert workers in copper and brass who make coffee-pots of an elegant shape ; but a number of these, having emigrated, are now plying their craft in different parts of the Persian Gulf, and the monopoly formerly enjoyed by Hasa in this line has ceased to exist. Trade.*—-Trade has its principal seat at Hofuf, which is the chief market of the Hasa Oasis and surrounding country as well as an entrepot of the foreign trade of Najd ; but there is a secondary centre, of more restricted importance, at Qatif Town. The whole Sanjaq has only two parts, 'Oqair and Qatif Town ; of these the former serves Hofuf together with the regions directly or indirectly dependent on that place, while the port of Qatlf exists solely for the benefit of the Qatif Oasis and its smaller out side clientele. The present volume of foreign trade (in both directions) at Qatif Town is estimated at about 35 lakhs of rupees annually. Some account of the export and im port trade of the Hasa province will be found in the articles on Qatif Town and 'Oqair Port: this trade is principally and almost exclusively with Bahrain, where is Manamah, the actual steam port of the Sanjaq. The only exports of importance are dates and other products of the date palm ; reeds and reed-matting; donkeys, ghi, hides and 'Abas saddle bags. The destinations and ♦Some particulars about the trade of Qatif are contained in the Government of India's Foreign ProceedingB for JTanuary 1901 and January 1904. N4^ HASA 779 quantities of the dates exported are detailed in the articles on the Hasa and Qatif Oases. Date branches for firewood are despatched to Bahrain and Persia; reeds for mat-making from Qatif to Bahrain ; finished reed-mats to Masqat, Qatar and Basrah, donkeys, ghi and hides to Bahrain and hides to Persia. Imports are piece-goods, rice, wheat, barley, coffee, sugar, spices, dried fish, oil, metals and hardware: except a part of the cereals, which is received from Turiksh 'Iraq and from Persia, these are obtained almost entirely through Bahrain and are largely of Indian provenance. The slave trade is said to be carried on freely in Hasa at the present day, even in the town of Hofuf. A good many of the negroes sold in Hasa are taken to Qatar to be employed in pearl diving. Weights. —In the tables of weights which follow, the English equivalents, given in avoirdupois weight, have been calculated from different data and are not entirely con sistent. The weights used in the Hasa Oasis for general and retail purposes are called Asqat and are these :— 1 Ruba* = », = -68 lb. (but it is sometimes taken a-s equal in weight to 12 Riyals or 28| Indian rupees that is, to 28| Indian Tolas or -73 lb)^ 1 Thamin or 1 Huqqah = 4 Ruba* 2*75 lbs. (or rather more). 1 Qiyasah. Hasa Mann = r8 Thamin 'J C. 8 Huqqah ) 23 lbs. (or rather less). 8 Thamin or 8 Huqqah 24 Qiyasah= 552 lbs. (or rather less). Other weights, with special, uses, in the Hasa Oasis are the (local) Mithqal Shlrazi, equal to f of an Indian Tola or 72 grains, for transactions in gold and silver; the Mus- miyah, of 10 Qiyasah or 230 lbs., for wholesale dealings in locally grown cereals ; and the Waznah, which is i of a Qiyasah and so equivalent to about 3f lbs., for wholesale operations in dates, these being always estimated by the Waznah, not by the Qiyasah or Mann. The Qiyasah is considered to be the true unit of weight in Hasa. In the Qatif Oasis the ordinary weights used in retail trade are; 1 Qiyas 1 Alf = 1 Qatif Mann = 1 Qallah = 1*07 lbs. (but it is sometimes taken as being equal in weight to 18 Riyals or 102 Mithqal Shirazi, both rather less than this). 2*14 lbs. 34-37 lbs. 68*75 lbs. 2 Qiyas = 16 Alf = 2 Qatif Manns = Wholesale business in dates is conducted in Qallahs. Besides the above the Qatif Oasis possesses two other tables of weight for special purposes. The first, for the weighment of precious metals, runs:— 1 Mithqal Mishkhas ) or S = ., =54 grs. (viz., ^ of an Indian Tola). 1 Hammar J 1 (local) Mithqal Shirazi= .. =72 grs. {viz., f of an Indian Tola). 1 Khamsin = 10 Mithqal Shi-= 1-65 oz. razi. I Miyah 'J * or &gt; =2 Khamsin = 3*29 oz. 1 Amyah ) The second, which is for retail dealings in meat, fish, etc., is as follows:—• 1 Waqiyah = .. = -68 lb. 1 Huqqah = 4 Waqiyah = 2*75 lbs. Qatif Mann = 12| Huqqah = 34-37 lbs. In Qatif the Mann is regarded as the real unit of weight. The Qiyasah of the Hasa Oasis and the Qiyas of Qatif are, it will be observed, entirely different weights ; but the Ruba' for general purposes of Hasa and the Waqiyah for the 5u2780 HASA Bale of certain articles in Qatif are identical, and each of them is equal to J of a Bahrain Ruba'. The Qallah is altogether-peculiar to Qatif, and there is no Qiyas or Alf in Hasa. Wholesale weighments in the Hasa Sanjaq are made by means of a machine which is in fact a rudimentary steelyard ; the moveable weight in this instrument consists of a perforated stone slung by a string from the lever ; and the lever in the Hasa Oasis, is graduated in Waznahs, Qiyasahs and Manns. Measures. —In both oases the unit of linear measure is the Dhira' which in Hasa is of the same length as in Bahrain, viz,, 18| inches, and in Qat f is 19f inches. Currency. —The currency of the Sanjaq is mixed. The popular standard [is the Riyal or Maria Theresa dollar, here worth on the average about l-s. \0\d. English. Qatif Town accepts Indian rupees readily, at least 3 lakhs of rupees having been sent there for the purchase of dates in 1905, and Indian currency notes are favourably received in the towns of Qatif and Hofuf. The following is a table of the principal coins, real and imaginary, in the Sanjaq :— Name. Average bazaar rate. R emarks. Mardhuf J of a Muhammadi yah (see below).

It is of copper and about an inch and a half in length ; the shape is difficult to describe. The Tawilah appears to have been formed by doubling a strip of metal in the middle, after which the two limbs were compressed and wielded together for f of the distance from the place of flexure, the points remaining slightly separated after the manner of a split-pin. The free ends are rounded, the compressed part is flattened on both sides; an illegible inscription, apparent ly impressed before the strip was bent, is found on the exterior faces of the flattened portion. Communications,—See Routes in Arabia* Recent History and Present Politics. Turkish rule in Hasa, which had extended without interruption for 42 years from the occnpation by Midhat Pasha in 1871, was ended in 1913 by Ibn Saud, Emir of Nejd, who on May 5th seized Hofuf without much fighting, and soon afterwards took Qatif. The Turkish garrison withdrew first to Oqair, then to Bahrein whence, with the troops from Qatif it finally sailed to Basrah. Amirs were appointed by Ibn Saud in Hofuf and Qatif, and at a mooting at Oqair with Captain Shalsespear, the British Political AgentHAS —HAS 781 f a Bahrain in Hasa, Jasa Oasis, jg h the Riygl Qatlf Town ! eived in the QS) real and ulkr to m mint- an inch difficult )ears to itrip of the two melded q the naining [met of m both pparent- ip was 33 of the romtho oi Kejd, ik Qatif. 0 troops ofuf an&lt;J from Koweit, in 1913, the Emir announced that these officials were instructed to help and protect British subjects in consultation with the Agent. In June 1914 Ibn Saud accepted the title of Wali of Nejd and Hasa from the Ottoman Government, but he continued to invite closer relations with the Indian Government, and on Captain Shakespear'a appointment as Political Officer in Nejd, later in the same year, he received the British representative with cordiality. On the outbreak of the European War he opposed Ibn Rashid, who had espoused Turkish interests in Arabia, and fought a drawn battle with him at Mejma'a in Sedeir, in March 1915 ; but in the summer of the same year a formal peace was concluded between the two Emirs. Ibn Saud can summon to his standard the 'Ajman, Beni Khalid, and Beni Hajar, and to his control over these tribes is due the improvement in the security of the Hasa province and the caravan routes by which it is approached. The hostility of the Bedouin to the Turks had been such hat the sover eignty of the Sultan extended no further than the effective power of the garrisons and military or police posts, while life and property were insecure even in the neighbourhood of Hofuf. Under the Porte, the whole region of Hasa, known as the Sanjaq of Nejd,' formed a division of the Basrah vilayet. The capital was Hofuf, and the country was administered on the usual Turkish system, though the government approximated to the nature of a military occupation. Subsidies were paid to the 'Ajmn, Beni Haj ar, Beni Khalid, and Ahl Murreh tribes, who provided carriers of the official mails, and raflk for their escort. The garrison, chiefly concentrated at Hofuf and Qatif, consisted of 4 batta lions of infantry and 2 squadrons of cavalry, with one mule battery, and a small auxiliary camel corps of Arabs. In addition, there were 6 companies of Dhdhltuyahs, 4 of which were mounted. The revenue was chefly obtained from agriculture, more especially date-cultivation, a tax being imposed on dates in Qatif, while in Hasa the Government took a share of the crops. The amount thus obtained was estimated at nearly £25,000: customs were farmed, and are said to have yielded as much again. There were no public posts or telegraphs, HASA (A l)— A railway station, at an altitude of 2,696 feet, on the Hejaz Railway and 236 miles from Damascus.

HASAN (Balad Bani Bu)— A straggling town or settlement in the Ja'alan district of the 'Oman SultanateJ capital of the Bani Bu Hasan tribe; it is situated about 35 miles south-west by south of Sur and extends perhaps five miles in a north and south direction with a breadth of about one mile. On the north side the settlement is defended by a wall and boasts two forts, one of mud, the other of gypsum stucco ; there are also towers, defending the springs on which the irrigation of the place depends, about one mile to the westward ; and to the south-east stands a stone and gypsum fort surrounded by about 30 houses which is called Hisn-al-Mashaikh. The hostile settlement of Balad Bani Bu 'All lies about 7 miles to the south-south-east, the distance being measured from the centre of the one oasis to the centre of the other. The houses of Balad Bani Bo. Hasan are said to number 1,000, and, some allowance being made for exaggeration, the population may amount to 4,000 souls ; the ordinary building material is mud, but some gypsum stucco is also seen. The dwellings, through out the greater part of the settlement, are interspersed with date plantations ; the groves are densest towards the west and south. Streams of clear and sweet water, sent forth by a dozen or more springs, irrigate the date groves ; and drinking water is drawn from wells 4 to 5 fathoms deep. Lucerne and a little maize and cotton are cultivated as well as dates; the date plantations are reported to contain 10,000 trees. Only about 15 horses are owned by the inhabitants: other livestock are 250 camels, 400 donkeys and 2,000 sheep and goats. There is a respectable bazar of about 40 shops in which cloth and food-stuffs are sold. There are no manufactures ; but a little cloth is woven for local consumption, and boiled dried dates called Bisr are exported to Bombay through Sar and Masqat Town. Stir is the usual port of Balad Bani Bu Hasan, and the route thither lies down Wadi Falaij, passing a short distance to the east of Kamil and Wafi. One of the south-western quarters of the town, called Jawabi-al-Khuwaisah, was the scene in July 1881 of a severe struggle between the Bani Bu Hasan and the Bani Bu Ali in which the former are said to have lost 75 and the latter 60 in killed.

HASHISH GHUBBAT— A bay at the head of the Gulf of Masirah on the south-east coast of Arabia, 7 miles wide and 9 miles deep. The shore of the bay is low, sandy and desolate throughout, with a low range of hills inland on the western side. Near the centre of the bay is Abb Island, a low rocky island with a small rock off its southern end. On the mud bank near the head of the bay are two islands, Raqq and Mahot. The former is rocky and steep, and the latter is low, sandy, and thickly covered with shrubs and mangrove bushes, tt has a wretchedly poor hut village, from which however it is sometimes possible to procure very good sheep or goats, firewood and fresh water. An anchorage in from 3 to 6 or 7 fathoms exists in that portion of the bay west of Abb Island. The bottom is mud. East of the same island the bottom is sand, and the depth only —3 fathoms.

HASI (S harm)— A harbour in Hejaz, Western Arabia, about 20 miles southward of Ras Abu Madd. The northern half of the harbour is choked by reefs, and nearly half of the eastern part of the remaining portion is in a similar condition ; this only leaves a passage about two- thirds of a cable wide, from the outer to the inner anchorage. The outer anchorage is not recommended, as the space is contracted, the depth 17-—39 fathoms, and the bottom foul. The inner anchorage is in a basin cables in diameter, with a depth of o—7 fathoms. Water, of a v ry iniiff rent quality, may be obtained from wells about a mile from the beach.—(ifecZ Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot, 1909).

HASWAH (K han-al)— A halting place on the Baghdad-Hillah route, 2 miles south of the spot where the roads to Hillah and Karbala bifurcate. The khan is a one-storeyed building, with a courtyard surrounded by 38 arched recesses, intended as lodging places for travellers. Behind these recesses are rows of vaulted stables. A parapet wall about 4 feet high runs all round the roofj The courtyard would accommodate 100 men, and the stables 150 animals. The khan itself stands upon a slight eminence. Attached to it is a village of some 60 domed brick dwellings, 2 coffee shops, and a small Zaptieh post. The village owns a few animals, but supplies except firewood are practically nil. There is some cultivation on the north-west side.— [Newmarch, 1905.) HASWAIN— A village on the Mahrah Coast, Southern Arabia, about 10 miles westward of Ras Fartak.

HATAB (U mm-al)— A small islet in the Persian Gulf, lying off the coast of Trucial 'Oman at a distance of about 75 miles south by east from Dahah, in Qatar. It is a low sand island, about half a mile in extent, 8 miles west north-westward from the southern Yasat island, and possessing tufts of coarse grass. It is situated on a rocky reef with several rocks above water off the northern end; the reef extends half a mile from the eastern and western sides, but the southern side is clear.— {Persian Gulf Pilot.) HATAIM— The singular is Hataimi, and there is a distributive plural Hatman. The Hataim are a nomed tribe of Central Arabia ; their origin is uncertain and they are not regarded as true Arabs. Location. —The Hataim (exclusive of the Hawazim section whose distribution is dis cussed below) inhabit the country from Khaibar eastwards as far as the Abanat hills upon Wadi-ar-Rummah and are hemmed in between the Harb on the south and the 'Anizah on the north. Some settled Hataim are said to be found in the villages of Hayat and Thurghud in Harrat Khaibar, of Ghazalah and Mustajiddah in Jabal Shammar, and 'Ayun-as-Suwaina' and Faidhah in Wadi-as-Sirr. Leachman states that settled Hataim are also to be found in 'Ayun-as-Sirr. Disviions and Number. —Amongst the sections of the Hataim are the :— 'Awamirah Jala dan. Barraqah. Khiyarat. Bedowna. Mahaimizat. Dalamlk. Madharibah. Dammuk. Nuwamisah. Faradassa,. Qa'abid. Hawazim. Simrah.790 HAT -HAT The shaikhs of the tribe are said to belong to the Barraqah section. The HawSzim section (by some authorities treated as Harb and not Hataim) are either frequently confounded, or are really identioal with the 'Awazim tribe of Kuwait; these Hawazim or 'Awazim are found at Jauf-al-'Amir, Sakakah, Tayma, Baidha Nathil, and also perhaps at the village of Ghat in the Sadair district of southern Najd. It is curious that the Rashaidah, who resemble the 'Awazim and like them live near Kuwait, are also said to be connected with the Hataim. The Hataim in the west of Central Arabia may be roughly estimated at 3,000 souls. Life and character. —The Hataim live in the ordinary manner, but they are distin guished from Arab Bedouins by their long blue shirts. They are less cheerful, frank, dignified, and honourable than the Arabs, and also less civil to guests. The Hataim are good fighting material and often excellent shots , in person they are fairer and more robust than the Arabs and their women are better looking. They are looked down upon by other Bedouins. As hunters they are second only to the Salaib, and sometimes they even succeed in killing ostriches. Their dromedaries have always been among the best, rivalling those of the Shararat, but they have never been well provided with horses though they own many small cattle. Some sections of the Hataim make cheeses of sheep and goats' milk which they sell at Khaibar. Political position. —Notwithstanding their comparatively thriving condition the Hataim are despised by the Arabs, who class them with the Salaib below all Arab tribes and taunt them with being eaters of carrion. The Arabs never intermarry with the Hataim, although some 'Anizah and Harb families dwell among them ; and on the other hand poor Hataim women sometimes condescend to mate with negroes. The Hataim generally render khuwwah, or akhdwah, to all from whom they have anything to fear, and this is doubtless the secret of their relative prosperity. In 1878 some of those about Khaibar paid taxes both to the Amir of Jabal Shammar and to the Turks, and they still give khuwwah simultaneously to the Harb, Shammar, and 'Anizah tribes. —{Doughty ; Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf; LeacJiman.) HATlT (S aih)— A plain, the only one of any extend in the interior of the Masqat District of the 'Oman Sultanate'; it includes part of the upper basins of Wadis 'Adai, Maih and Mijlas and a small portion of the course of Wadi Sarain. It begins on the north at Mutahaddamat in Wadi 'Adai and runs southwards to include Blrain ; it then curves round eastwards embracing the last 8 miles of Wadi Jannah—here called also Wadi Hatat—before its junction with Wadi Maih; finally it takes in the whole of Wadi Maih above Tawilah, the whole of Wadi Sarain below Qabil 'Ali-bin-Zaman, and the upper part of Wadi Mijlas with its tributary Wadi Haithadh. The north-western part of the plain is the broader and more open, its width hereabouts approaching or attaining 8 miles : south- east-wards of Wadi Jannah it is narrow and more broken up. The length of Saih Hatat alon» the curve in which it lies is about 30 miles. Where it adjoins eastern Ha jar it has a few stunted trees and shrubs, greatly, diminished by the ravages of Masqat wood cutters • and in some places on the same side it is studded with natural pillars of rock, 20 to 25 feet high. The inhabitants of the villages of Saih Hatat, which can be ascer tained from the articles on the Wadis traversing it, are mostly Bani Wahaib; there are also Bani Khazam. nATAT (W adi)—• See Saih Hatat and also Wadi Maih.

These villages are poor in animals ; altogether they are said to contain only 50 camels, 100 donkeys, 50 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. Wadi Hatta carries the drainage of Wadi Qahfi and its tributary Wadi-al-Hayul, which comes from the neighbourhood of Mahadhah.

IIAUTA— See Aden Protectorate, HAUTAH— A district in the interior of southern Najd forming part of the Wahabi dominions Boundaries and physical features. —Hautah is adjoined on the north by the district of Harlq, being separated from it by Jabal Hilaiyah ; on the east it meets the district of Kharj ; and on the south it is divided from the district of Aflaj by the range of Jabal Birk. The western limit of the Hautah district has not been ascertained, but it is perhaps the Tuwaiq range. The main feature of Hautah is a valley running apparently east- north-east from Hautah town to Dilam in Kharj and about 35 miles distant; by this valley, which immediately below Hautah town seems to be called Braik, the drainage of Hautah is conveyed to the Kharj district. The Hautah valley has two main feeders : that of Hilwah joining it, apparently from the south, several miles below Hautah town, and that of Hariq which comes in from the north-west at a point still further in the direc tion of Kharj. The mountain ranges which bound the district on north and south are said to constitute a s3riou3 obstacle to egress upon those sides ; but a pass called 8alamiyah, mentioned in the article on Afiaj, connects the valley of Hilwah with the Farshah division of Afiaj.* Topography, population and resources. —The following table contains an account of the principal places in Hautah :—- Name. Hautah town Position. About 35 miles west- south-west of Dilam in Kharj and perhaps 20 miles south by west of Harlq town in in Hariq. Houses and inhabitants. The population is about 4,000 souls. The principal tribes are: Dawasir of the Ghaiyithat sec tion, 30 houses ; Fadhul of the A1 Talib section, 20 houses, and of the Khatran section 20 ; Sahul, 30 hou ses ; Sabai' of the Khathlan section, 20 R emarks. The majority of the inhabitants live not in the town proper, which is called Hillah but in^ detached quarters among the date groves. The greater part of the plantations seem to belong to a part of the settlement called Braik which appa rently gives its name * Hautah does not appear to have been visited to the article on Hariq.

The chief divisions of the town are sp id to be Fariq A1 Husain Salaiyib, Qil'ah, Dhahirah and Sadr. There are about 300 houses, viz., 170 of Bani Tamim; 30 of Dawasir of the Ghaiyithat section; 20 of Fadhul; 20 of Sabai' of the Khathlan section; 10 of 'Anizah of the Baud section; and 60 of Bani Khadhir. 30 houses, viz., 20 of Bani Tamim and 10 of the Bani Khadhir. A Qasr of Khadhir. Bani Remarks, to, or is called after, the valley below the town; the bulk of the palms are said to be situated in the Hautah valley below its junction with the tributary from Hil wah and above its meeting with that which comes from Hariq. Besides dates the ordinary crops and fruits of southern Najd are grown. The wells are deep and camels are used to work the water lifts, which are beyond the power of bul locks and donkeys. The town is largely commercial and has a bazar of about 80 shops. The inhabit ants own about 500 camels, 50 horses, 50 donkeys and 100 cattle: a number of the camels are em ployed in trading caravans. There are the usual dates, fruits, cereals and lucerne; the wells are not quite so deep as those of Hautah town, say 18 fathoms. Camels number about 300, donkeys 50 and cattle 100. The date plantations are very dense. Resembles Hilwah in its general character istics, but livestock are proportionately fewer. A considerable date grove belongs to this place.HAU—HAW 795 It will be seen from the above table that the settled population of the district is tribally very composite, and that it probably amounts to rather less than 6,000 souls, of whom the majority inhabit the town of Hautah and its suburbs. The agriculture and livestock are those of southern Najd generally, but the date trees are exceptionally large and fine, some of them (it is said) yielding an incredible quantity of dates in a single season. The other fruits of the district are also above the average. _ . ^ Trade. —There is a considerable trade with Hasa and Qatar on the one side and with Yaman and Hijaz on the other ; piece-goods are chiefly obtained from Hasa with which district nearly all the local merchants have business relations,—arms and ammunition are imported through Qatar, and coffee is brought from Yaman. A certain number of Hautah merchants are accustomed to visit India for trade. Among the principal firms in Hautah are the Ghanaim, who are Bani Tamim, and the 'Atiqah and Wahabis, who belong to the Bani Khadhlr. There are also some merchants of repute anong the Daud. Administration. —The Amir of Hautah town and principal man in the district is at present one Muhammad Abu Shaibah of the Bani Tamim. He stands high in the favour of Ibn Saud and has authority under the Wahhabi rulers over all Hautah, even the Arn'r of Hilwah (now 'Abdul' Aziz -bin-Kharaiyis) having been made subordinate to him. This is regarded as an exceptional and temporary arrangement, due to the personal influence of Abu Shaibah with Ibn Saud. The people of Hautah are well armed with rifles, but swords are still carried. Palgrave asserts that Hautah, now the vassal of Riyadh, was once its rival.

HAWASINAH (F ala.t-al)—- A place in Wadi-al-Hawasinah (q.v.). HAWASINAH (Q asbiyat-al)— See Saham (Sub-Vilayet). HAWASINAH (W adi-al)— A valley in the western Hajar district of the 'Oman Sultanate, which, beginning at the north side of a pass some miles north of Miskin in Dhahirah, reaches the sea at Khaburah in Batinah a little to the east of the bazaar of that town. Wadi-al-Hawasinah contains the following places, which we give in their order from above downwards; the inhabitants are all Hawasinah :— Place. Position. On which bank. Number of houses. R emarks.

The population of the valley above the point where it enters Batinah seems to be about 2,300 souls. Wadi-al-Hawasinah has two principal tributaries, both from the west. The upper of these is Wadi-adh-Dhula', which comes in below Harmali and above Shakhb5t and contains only one village, namely Bada'ah Aulad Juma-'ah, given in the table above. The other, Wadi Bani 'Umr, enters Wadi-al-Hawasinah between Ghaizain and Qasaf, outside the hills ; it is elsewhere described under its own name, but we may here note that its uppermost village is another Mijzi which can be reached from the Mijzi in Wadi- al-Hawasinah in about 5 hours by a pass across the hills. Wadi-al-Hawasinah is deep and narrow, and the hills which form its sides are of dark coloured rock. The villages are built upon the hill-sides, and their date trees grow on artificial terraces to which spring-water is conducted in channels: there are no wells. The houses are of stone and mud; the crops besides dates are wheat, barley, hajriy maize, millet, lucerne, beans, sweet potatoes, and various grasses which are cultivated as fodder for animals ; the people keep camels, cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys. Fruits are limes, mangoes, grapes, olives, plums, pomegranates, figs, quinces and almzmds. The trade of Wadi-al-Hawasinah is with Khabarah and Suwaiq.

HAZA'-ADH-DHABL— See 'Oman (Trucial)^ HAZAIM— A district of the Kuwait Shaikhdom, enclosed by the sea on the east^ by the Salu^ district on the north, and by the Shaqq district on the west; the briny rivulet of Maqta' marks its southern limit and divides it from the plain of Lablbah, The middle of the district is about 60 miles south by east of Kuwait Town ; its total extent is doubtful. Hazaim consists of a large plain without trees but not destitute of camel grazing; the soil is firm and dark-coloured and free from stony patches. At the south end, near the Maqta' stream, is a Sabakhah or saline wet-weather marsh. Hazaim contains the following places which we have tabulated in their alphabetical order^ Name, Position, | Character.

HAZAIM-AS-SAID— A group of wells on the eastern Hajj route from Qaslm, and situated at a distance from Mecca estimated at 221 miles. The wells, which are located in a grove of accacia trees, contain drinkable but unwholesome water at 8 or 9 feet. There are ponds near by for watering cattle.— {Doughty.) HAZAIMA— One of the Shaqiq wells {q.v.).HIZ—HAZ 803 HA2AIM1^. See Lailah. HAZAM— A valuable fort and small village in the Sultanate of 'Oman; situated on the west side of Wadi Fara' at less than 1 mile from the bed of the ivddi and some 15 miles to the south-west of the town of Masna'ah in Batinah, which is the port of Hazam. Hazam is the lowest point in the tract known as Rustaq, and there is a difference of opinion regarding the district in which it is situated, some assigning it to Hajar, which is prob ably correct, and others to Batinah ; this much is clear that it stands in a plain, at some distance from the hills of Hajar properly so called. The village is walled and consists of about 80 houses of the Miyayihah and Ya'aribah tribes, in the centre of which is the celebrated fort. There are no wells here, and the Water-supply depends on subterranean conduits from Wadi Fara' which enter the village, The date plantations are extensive, containing (it is estimated) 70,000 palms ; and wheat; barley, sesame, beans, sugarcane and lucerne are grown. Horses are said to number 4, donkeys 150, camels 100 and sheep and goats 900. The fort is one which can be held by a small garrison and its possession gives command of routes, especially that to Suwaiq, which are important to the neighbouring tribes of Batinah and particularly to the Yal Sa'ad. Hazam originally belonged to the Ya'ari bah, from whom it was captured by 'Azzam-bin-Qais in 1870 after a long seige. It ia now in the possession of Saiyid Sa'id-bin-Ibrahim of Rustaq, a relation and virtually independent vassal of the present Sultan of ^ Oman, HAZAM— See Hasa (Al) (Oasis). HAZAM (or Hazam-ar-Raji).— See Najd HAZAM— See Sabaf (Wadi). HAZAM— The name applied to several desert tracts in Arabia, and notably to a portion of the region lying between Qasim and Mecca. The tract of desert lying immediately to the east of Jabal Misma', in the Jabal Shammar district, is also called Al-Hazam. The name is probably a generic term for rough soil strewn with stones.

HAZIL (Bir)— A well-known watering place in Northern Najd, on the most westerly of the routes running from Karbala and Najaf to Hail and situated about midway between the two latter towns. The wells, which number a hundred or even more, are sunk through sandstone rock and lie in a large depression some 10 miles in circumference; they a2 ■ 111804 HAZ~HEJ contain sweet water at about 60 feet the level being fairly constant. Bir Etazil lieal about east of Jauf-al-'Umr, from which it is distant three dhalul days' journey. The route from Jauf-al-'Umr to Shabaikah, on the Darb Zubaidah, passes through Bir Hazii.— {Leachman, 1912.) The exact position of these we 1 .Is is uncertain. Only two Europeans have ever visited Hazil, namely Wallin, in June, 1848, and Leachman, in November, 1912. In Ruber's map the position of Hazil, like that of Halyaniyah, is incorrect. With nothing more solid to go upon than Arab information, he has placed Hazil far too much to the west. On the other hand, according to Leachman's compu tation, Wallin has shown Hazil many miles too far to the east. The last-named autho rity says that water was found in the Hazil wells at 20 fathoms. Leachman consi ders this estimate excessive. HAZIM (Al)— A group of 20 rock wells on the I&gt;era ? a-Jauf-al- f Umr route f 115 miles from the former place. The water is fairly good, and is obtainable all the year rounds at 16 feet. The northernmost well has the best water. About 5 miles south-west is the hill of Ar- Kashrashiyah.— {Huher, 1883.)

HAZRA (Ras-AL)— A headland in the Persian Gulf in the large bay formed by the Trucial coast and Qatar. It is 10 miles west-north-westward of Ras Mashairib, and is very low, rocky, and shelving; the coast from the headland trends west-south-westward 15 miles to Khor-ad-Duan, and then turns north-north - eastward 20 niiles to Ras Bu Kamhaiz. There is no information about the bay extending; soUth-Westward between Ras-al- Hazra and Ras Bu Kamhaiz subsequent to the survey of 1823 ; it contains many shoal patches ; the depth nowhere exceeds 10 fathoms, and is generally less* with mud bottom* The shores are low white hills, except in the vicinity of Khor- adh-DhuWaihin at the head.— {Persian Gulf Pilot.) HEJAZ— Area. —As designating a vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, te Hejaz means the north' western part of Arabia from the head of the Gulf of Akaba to a point between Lith and Qunfideh, about half-way down the coast, i.e. it lies between lats. 29° 30' and 20° N. Its inland boundary has not been defined, being dependent on the distance which the Turkish power has been able to make itself felt in the direction of Jebel Shammar and Nejd. Under the Ottoman theoretic arrangement, both these latter districts are included in the vilayet of Basra, and Hejaz is understood to be bounded by a line drawn vertically from north to south through the desert and steppe east of Teima. But really the limit of effective Turkish authority, and therefore of the province of Hejaz, has never been pushed east of the Kheibar oasis. The province measures^ therefore, about 700 miles from north to south by some 250 west to east (175,000 square miles)* In native parlance, however, Hejaz does not begin until much farther south, its upper limit being a line drawn inland from the Red Sea coast, just north of El-Wejh y through El-'Ala and the steppe-desert to the northernmost point of the Harrat Kheibar.. Midian and its hinterland (Hisma) are thus excluded. This limitation of Hejaz is recognised not only by religious prejudice, but also by the Ottoman Government, in that it allows Christians to pass down the Hejaz railway as far as the Meda'in Salih, a few miles north of El-'Ala, but not south of it except for some special official reason. Physical Character.- —In its widest sense, Hejaz is the northern half of the upraised ridge ©f the Arabian shelf. The short and steep fall westward to the Red Sea, however, is inter- supted by a second ridge which lies a short way back from the shore, and in the not hernHEJAZ 805 n's compu, i med authof. |3art (Midiao) attains a greater elevation (peaks over 9,000 feet) than the ridge itself. Hejaz, therefore, comprises five parallel zones : (1) a low, sandy coastal strip (Tihameh) fringed with coral reef, narrowest in Midian, where, at points, the highlands fall almost into the sea; (2) a mountainous bell falling in elevation from north to south, until between Jiddeh and Mecca it is hardly 2,000 feet high ; (3) an intramontane plateau bel J of great elevation in the north, where the lava caps of the Hisma have resisted denudation, but falling south ward to under 1,000 feet west of Mecca and Ta if ; (4) the ridge itself, highest where capp ed with lava, as in the Hisma, 'Aweiridh, and Kheibar harms (8,000 to 6,000 ft.), but still keeping a mean elevation of over 5,000 ft. behind Mecca ; (5) the uppermost fringe of the eastward slope towards Central Arabia. The few centres of settled population lie almost entirely in the first and third of these zones, the port-settlement, Akaba, Muweileh, El-Wejh, Yambo', Rabigh, Jiddeh, and Lith, with a few intermediate groups of huts, being of course in the first, and El-'Ala, Medina, and Mecca in the third. The only exceptions of note are certain rare oases. Which lie on the line between the fourth and fifth zones, Teima, Kheibar, Henakiyeh, and Ta'if. The Hejaz railway, after following the western edge of the fifth zone from Ma'an and making for the third in order to reach Medina, has to cross a low part (pass of Qalaat Dar-el Hamrah, 3,700 ft.) of the fourth zone (the ' ridge ') between Tebuk and Meda'in Salih. From Medina the rails could reach Mecca by following the same zone; but for several reasons, e.g., for better security from interference by nomad tribes, it has been proposed to bring them down westward into the first zone at Rabigh, and thence up behind Jiddeh into the third again. A few big drainage channels originating on the ridge, traverse the third zone, and break through the second to the sea. all being of the fiumara type, i.e., without perma nent surface flow. In the north (Midian), where the elevation is great and there is some precipitation from the eastern Mediterranean area, these deep wadis follow one another in rapid succession. They cut up the country into a series of detached blocks, and force north-south communications to keep either close along the shore (Egyptian Pilgrim Boute) or within the fifth belt (Syrian Pilgrim Route and Hejaz Railway). Nor, owing to their exceedingly steep gradients, do they favour east-west communication, or create fertility. Midian, therefore, is a conspicuously ill, inhabited-unsettled and unknown district in a penisula to almost all parts of which these epithets apply in varying degrees. In Hejaz Proper, where the general elevation is lower and the gradients more gentle,, these fiumaras become less frequent and more beneficent. The most important of them, the Wadi Hamdh, which debouches few miles south of El-Wejah, unites two main channels from the ridge, one draining the Kheibar harm, the other the 'Aweiridh harm. The first gives Medina its underground waters and extensive suburban oasis ; the second supplies the palm-groves of El-'Ala. Other wadis of considerable size debouch near Yambo', Rabigh, Ras el-Makhluq, Jiddeh, and Lath, accounting for isolated patches of oasis not only at those points on the coast, but also in both the inner Tehamah and the third zone, between Medina and Mecca. Oases in the latter zone, however, seldom contain more than one or two permanent habitations, being owned by tribesmen of the surrounding steppes. The valleys of the southern wadis do not affect communica tions so adversely as in Midian. Indeed the westward course of Wadi Hamdh from Medina, and the confluence there of a tributary from the south, have facilitated the Pilgrim Route towards Mecca ; and the others all assist communication from the coast, e.g., between Yambo' and Medina ; between Rabigh or Jiddeh and Mecca ; and between Lith and Ta if. The characteristic of Hejaz is general barranness, relieved only in the first and third zones by rare oases. The littoral zone, except at wadi-mouths, is throughout dusty sand ; the hills of the second zone are of dusty surface where not naked limestone ; the third zone is steppe verging on nefud desert; the fourth is rocky in the northern part, and frequently harm desert; the fifth is stony steppe, softening in the north to sheer nefud. It hardly needs to be stated, therefore, that precipitation is insufficient through out Hejaz. The Midian highlands get a little more than the Egyptian Delta j Hejaz Proper a little more than middle Egypt. Except at Ta'if in the extreme south, there are no seasonal rains as in Asir and Yemen. In Mecca precipitation occurs, chiefly in summer, during brief thunderstorms, and water flows down the surface of Hejazi Jlumaras only at very rare intervals, though sometimes in great volume for a day or two.806 HEJAZ Climate. —The climate of the Hejaz lowland is little better than that of the Ifemen'Tiha^ meh, the mean annual temperature being nearer 90° than 80° (at Jiddeh the daily average shade maximum for the six summer months is 94°), and the air damp. Mecca, owing to its low elevation (700 to 860 feet) and its background of naked slopes, is worst off, and is an undesirable summer residence, being like a furnace on a still day ; but Medina, with a mean temperature of little over 70°, is healthy throughout the year^ Ta'if is the most salubrious of the Hejaz towns ; it shares the keen dry air which purifies the central steppe- lands, except in spots where water is over-abundant near the surface, as at Kheibar. The latter oasis, like Mecca and the coastal settlements, suffers from intermittent fevers ; Mecca itself has a bad name also for desenteric and other epidemic diseases* The high lands behind Mecca and about Ta'if know occasional frost during even summer nights. P opulation^ The population, settled and unsettled (most of the latter being at one season in the province, at another out of it on the east), may be guessed at w ell under a million. Only about one-eighth is either urban or ' on the land,' seven-eighths being Bedouin, wholly or semi-nomadic, who, generally speaking, are poverty-striken and therefore predatory. The principal tribal groups, which range Hejaz, are from north to south as follows In the north are certain sub-tribes of the scattered Wuld 'All aggregate, the Huweitat and Beni 'Atiyeh in Midian, and the Fuqara (Fajr) and Wuld Suleiman in the western Nefud and Teima-Kheibar steppe. Between these range Sherarat and Huteim, the latter having no well-defined dim. South of these, on the west, inland from El-Wejh to Yambo', are the Bali and the numerous Juheineh, partly settled. Right across central Hejaz, from Rabigh to Medina and beyond towards Jebel Shammar, lie the great and war-like Harb tribe, two of whose main divisions, the Masruh and the Beni 'Amr, are Hejazi, while the third, the Beni Salim, belongs rather to Central Arabia. South of the Harb and of the Mecca-Jiddeh line, and about Ta'if lies a section (Roqa) of the widely- spread Ateibeh, who range inland to Nejd. The Beni Thaqi, Hudheil, Jehadla, and some small tribes complete the nomadic population of Hejaz. The Beni Thaqif, Hudheil, Jehadla, Ateibeh, two sections at least of the Harb, the Juheineh and the Bali, acknowledge to some extent the authority of the Grand Sherif of Mecca. Roughly speaking, these tribes could put at least 10,000 armed and mounted men at his disposal; but they would form a very incoherent force. The Sherif has also a standing guard of 500 Arab rifles. The settled elements in the Hejaz population, however loyal to him, would be of little use in warfare, their exemption from conscription having debarred them from Ottoman training, and their parasitic existence on the profits of the Pilgrimage and on Government subsidies indisposing them to service. The men of Medina, however, show more military spirit than those of Mecca or Jiddeh. Racially the population of the towns is very mixed being Arab only in name; at Kheibar there is a strong negro element. Trade and Industries. —The trade of Hejaz is mainly derived from the needs of the Pilgrimage, and, apart from the export of dates from some of the oases, consists largely of imports. Mecca, the capital of Hejaz, has few natural advantages ; from the first the town must have owed its importance to its position as a commercial centre of exchange, and to its possession of the most holy temple, stones and well of heathen sanctity, which were afterwards incorporated in the Mohammedan cult. Its barren soil is unproductive, and it possesses no local industries whatever ; but goods are imported from all parts of the Orient. In its bazaars may be seen s lks from Syria, carpets from Turkey and Persia, brass-work from India and Egypt, for which the pilgrims pay heavily compared with prices in more accessible places. Traders from all parts of Islam bring their wares to Mecca and do profitable business. Jiddeh, as the port of Mecca, is the trade centre of Hejaz, and has become in conse quence one of the most considerable places on the coast of the Red Sea. In normal times it maintains a regular volume of commerce, not only with other Arabian ports and with the Persian Gulf, but also with India, Egypt, and Africa, and, for certain classes of com modities, with Great Britain and southern Europe. The great majority of the Mecca pilgrims arrive there by sea, and their transport and the supply of their wants constitute the chief business of the place. Many of its merchants, including a few Christian and Jews, are enterprising and wealthy. In addition to the supply of the pilgrims, Jiddeh also imports for the settled population of Hejaz, and for much of central Arabia, though Medina now obtains a certain amount of goods by the Hejaz railway.HEJAZ 807 In spite of its lack of facilities for the loading and unloading of cargo, Jiddeh is a regular place of call, twice monthly for the British India Steamship Company's vessels ; a French line of steamers and the vessels of the Austrian Lloyd touch there at irregular intervals. It is also visited by vessels of the Oceanic Steamship Company, the Khedivial Mail Steamship Company, three British Indian Steamship Companies, the Turkish Makhsusi Transport Company, and by those of three Dutch companies. Of sailing vessels trading with the port those of Turkish ownership greatly preponderate. From March 1910 to March 1911 (the latest figures available) the number of vessels entering the port of Jiddeh was 1,055, representing an aggregate of 656,632 tons. In 1910 the goods exported from Jiddeh were valued at over £65,000, but in each of the two preceding years they were nearer £50,000; they consisted chiefly of sheep-skins, goat-skins, cow-hides, camel-hides, wool, henna, gum, mother-of-pearl shells, etc. The great export is specie, amounting, it appears, to considerably over £1,000,000 a year. No regular stock of coal is maintained, and not more than a hundred and fifty tons of Welsh coal can be relied on. As in the case of exports, no official statistics are obtainable on the imports of Jiddeh; and hardly any information from local merchants. In 1910 it seems certain that about £90,000 was paid as import duties, which would give a little less than £1,000,000 worth (invoice Value) of dutiable imports. To this total must be added goods imported from Ottoman ports, on which no duty is levied. According to one estimate the total yearly imports have been placed as high as £1,750,000; as exports are trifling in amount, the goods imported are for the most part paid for by the money of the pilgrims. Imports consists chiefly of grain, piece-goods, coffee, tea, sugar, flour, tobacco, spices, timber, carpets, crockery, and hardware. Under normal conditions the principal imports from the British Empire are rice and cereals from India, piece-goods from the United Kingdom (direct, or via Constantinople, Syria, or India), hardware and metals from India and the United Kingdom. Flour is nearly all from British India, though a little of superior quality is important from Marseilles and Russia. Rice is from British India, but of wheat only a small proportion is Indian ; nearly all is from Basra, the freights being light, whereas freights from Egypt are found prohibitive. After tho outbreak of war with Turkey, in November 1914, grain and foodstuffs (including dura from Egypt) continued to be imported, in accordance with the policy of the British Government, who intended them for the support of the pilgrims and the Arab population of the Hejaz. The action of the Turkish authorities in seizing this grain for the use of their troops led for a time to the stoppage of suppl'es. But, owing to the distress among the civil population in the Hejaz, the British Government has since permitted the importation of grain and foodstuffs to be resumed. A share of the trade with central Arabia is absorbed by Yambo', the natural port for Medina and Nejd, and, although its commerce is of small importance compared with that of Jiddeh, the harbour is visited by Egyptian, British, Turkish, and Austrian stea mers. The revenue of the port is derived exclusively from the customs, the duties being nominally fixed at ten per cent. ; the imports are mostly grain, coffee, and articles of clothing. The other places on the coast of Hejaz are of no commercial importance, and, with one exception, are not ports of call for steamers ; at Lith, in southern Hejaz, an Austrian Lloyd steamer, calls at intervals of about three months on her passage from Loheia and Qunfideh. Apart from its indispensable trade in provisions, Medina has never acquired commercial importance, like that Mecca owes to the Hajj. For the pilgrimage to Medina is not compulsory, and only a small proportion of the Meccan pilgrims prolong their visit so as to include the Prophet's tomb, though visitors may come there at any time of the year. The town population of Medina resembles that of Mecca in subsisting entirely on the pilgrimage and the Turkish subsidy; but it.also possesses a large agricultural population (see p. ), and is a considerable source of local supply. The staple produce of Medina, as of all the oases of Hejaz, is the date. Of the nume rous varieties grown there, the best class of date {shelebi) is packed in skins and boxes; and exported to all parts of the Mohammedan world. The helw date of El-'Ala, soft and tasting like honey, is also famous outside the limits of Hejaz ; it, too, is stored in skins, where it begins to dry and crystalize, and is exported in that form. A consider able proportion of the crop is carried to Syria, in part by the Syrian Hajj. The honey- dat^ of El-'Ala is a favourite sweetmeat in Damascus. El-'Ala and the other oases m808 HEJAZ are also great sources of date-supply to the Bedoum, and thoy maintain some traffic with them in com and imported rice. The chief traffic of Kheibar and Henaklyeh is with Medina, merchants bringing their goods to the former oasis regularly for the autumn fair. The commercial connexions of Teima, on the other hand, run eastward, trades men from Jebel Shammar arriving there with Baghdad clothing and the light and cheaper Oulf calico ; coffee pestiles and mortars of limestone marble are also imported from Jauf. The only export of the oases, apart from dates and the small trade in cereals, is Teima rock-salt, which is used in all parts of Arabia ; it is said to be preferred to the sea-salt from El-Wejh and other coastal sources of supply. The domestic life and industries of the Hejaz oases are those of simple and primitive agriculturists. The clay-built houses are often spacious, with an upper floor, and the windows are open casements for light and air. The flooring is of beaten earth, the doors rudely constructed of palm-boards. Rafters are made of tamarisk and palm-beams for in all the oases tamarisk is grown for timber. Palmwood is used for cooking, but charcoal in the Nejd manner for the coffee-fires, the men making it in the desert. Camel harness is manufactured from palm-fibre ; but the villagers are chiefly occupied with the tending of their palm groves and with cultivation. The Hejazi are barren of invention and initiation. Water is their main concern, but they continue to use the old wells and rarely sink new ones. In most of the oases there is a trade in mutton, goat flesh, and daily provisions. But there are few bazaars, for every one is a merchant of his own produce in his own house. Currency. —At Mecca, Medina, and the ports, and to some extent along the Haij road, Turkish coinage is current, for the surra, or subsidy, is paid by the Turkish Gov ernment to the Sheikhs in Turkish mejidies. But the Government porhibition of the use of foreign money is obeyed only in transactions with Government departments ; hence the currency is confused and complicated. A great variety of coins circulate in the ports ; and at Jiddeh, and in a minor degree at Yambo' money-changers ply a lucrative trade. In the ports and towns rupees and dollars (both 4 brum ' and Maria Theresa ; see below) are the coins perhaps most in circulation. The Turkish silver mejidie and gold lira are in considerable circulation/especially for official purposes ; but the Turkish silver piastre is not much in circulation, being mostly replaced by the Indian 2-anna piece. The following tables give the silver and gold currency of Jiddeh : Silver. The silver currency for ordinary transactions begins from the lowest coin, the devani, which is an imaginary or ' account' coin, or at any rate is now never seen. 28 devanis = 1 rezin (also imaginary). 40 devanis = 1 bad piastre (also imaginary). 28 bad piastres = 1 Umla dollar (also imaginary). 40 rezins == I Umla dollar (also imaginary). The imaginary Umla dollar is the standard most used in transactions with Arabs of the interior. 20 to 21J bad piastres == 1 rupee. 322 to 324 bad piastres = 1 £ st. 1 Ottoman silver piastre (real coin) = 2d. (about). 20 Ottoman silver piastres (real coin) = 1 mejidie. 120 to 122 Ottoman silver piastres (real coin) = 1 £ st. 110 Ottoman Government account piastres, called ' gold ' (imaginary coin) = 1 £ st. Dollars, called ' brum,' are of three kinds, viz.:— Singapore ^ Japanese I — each from 30 to 36 bad piastres. Mexican J Maria Theresa or Franca dollar = 30 to 36 bad piastres. Japanese or Dutch dollar = 64 bad piastres. Egyptian dollar of 20 Egyptian piastres = 64 to 66 bad piastres. Tunis dollar (5 fr.) = 60 to 64 bad piastres. Persian kran = 10J bad piastres. Rupees at the above-mentioned rate (15 Rs. per 1 £ st., fixed rate) are in wide and cons tant circulation.HEJAZ Gold. 809 The exchange for British gold has been already given : the following table gives that for the Turkish lira, the Napoleon, and the Russian 10-rouble piece: Turkish lira = 290 to 294 bad piastres. Napoleon = 250 to 255^ bad piastres. Russian 10-rouble piece = 329 to 330 bad piastres. In the oases and the inland district of Hejaz the riyal, or Maria Theresa dollar, is the common standard of value for houses, land, produce, camels, and live-stock generally ; but little silver is in actual circulation. At Teima the silver riyals received by the village dealers from the sale of dates or grain to nomads (who in their turn had parted with camels to brokers), is nearly all exhausted for the'annual tribute, certain sheikhs riding with it to Ha'il after the date harvest, to pay it into the treasury of the Emir, Elsewhere the stock of silver does not accumulate, but soon finds its way to the coast, to Nejd, or to Syria, in payment for goods imported. Consequently for the traffic of daily life very little money passes, though values and payments are generally reckoned on a silver basis. But this causes little inconvenience, for much of Arabian traffic is traditionally barter. When land is sold, for example, a part payment is made of such scanty silver as the purchaser possesses, and the rest is delivered in the form of dates, and in household gear, such as brass pots and vessels, which, with the exception of the rare sitting carpet, are nearly the only movables in their simple dwellings. Doughty reports a sale of an out- lying plot of land at Kheibar, for which the principle article was an old cutlass and its scabbard. The hire for camels is paid in dates ; at Teima, for example, a month's hire of a good camel is a hundred measures of dates, the equivalent of five riyals. Dates, in fact, form the commonest and most convenient medium of exchange in the oases. W eights and M easures. In Mecca, Medina, and their ports, Turkish weights and measures are largely employed but not to the exclusion of native standards. At Medina and in all the oases of He jar. the measure most commonly employed is the sah, which varies considerably in content in diffrent places. According to Doughty the sah is the equivalent of nearly two pints at Teima, nearly tree pints at El-'Ala, and five pints at Kheibar ; at Ha il he reports it is two pints and a half. The other measures in use, as given by Doughty, are the following: A medega (a small palm-basket), the equivalent of twelve sahs ; and a mejellad, the equivalent of five medegas. At Medina and elsewhere in Hejaz a skin of dates is called hasJiiyeh. Great bargains In dates are reckoned in camel-loads. The measure of length in Hejaz, as in other parts of Arabia appears to be the actual cubit, the distance from a man's elbow to the point of his middle finger. According to Doughty a 'palm-rod ' (length not stated) is employed at Kheibar as a larger lineal measure, the repair of an orchard wall being reckoned and paid for by the palm-rod. Government. —Under the Ottomon arrangement Hejaz became a vilayet, whose vali was resident at Mecca in winter and Ta'if in summer (except when the pilgrimage falls in the summer months). His Governorate included all the area from the border of the vilayet of Sham (Damascus), south of Ma'an, down to the northern limit of the vilayet of Yemen, south of Lith. Under him were four kazas. Yam bo', Rabigh, Jiddeh and Lith. But the Grand Sherif (see p. ), who was principal executive officer in Mecca, not only held a sort of extra-territorial position there, and at Taif, but exercised the only paramount authority recognised by seven-eighths of the population of Hejaz proper, as well as by that of north-eastern Asia and parts of western Nejd. The towns of Mecca and Medina have been not only tax-free so far as the Ottoman Government was concerned, but in receipt of subsidies from the Treasury {svrra) ; and so also were many nomad chiefs, notably certain Harb sheikhs, capable of inter fering with the passage of pilgrims or with the railway track. The whole province was exempt from military service, and an attempt to prevail on the Hejazis to accept conscription in 1914 was resisted successfully by the Sherif. The normal Turkish garrison, including the Sherif's own guard, was about 7,000 with 3 batteries, of which force a large part was usually cantoned along the Hejaz railway line, the proper garrisons of Mecca, Medinah, Jiddeh, Yambo', and Ta'lf being kept much below strength. The result was that only the centres of settled population, C52(w)GSB 5 m w mm810 HEJAZ the Hejaz railway line and the Mecca-Jiddeh road were effectively and continuously held. Other lines of communication were all precarious. The road from Medina to Yam bo', for example, required a strong escort, and the pilgrim tracks from Medina to Mecca were more often closed by the Harb than open, payments of surra notwith standing. The direct road from Mecca to Ta'if by 'Arafat was notoriously unsafe, and even on the Jiddeh road, in the long intervals between blockhouses, murders and high way robberies were of common occurrence. Recent History and Present Politics, —The ruling Grand Sherif, Hussein ibn y AlT, obtained the Shorifate in 1908, when, after twenty-five years' residence in Constantinople, he was nominated by Kiamil Pasha to succeed his uncle 'Abdallah, who had died on his way to Mecca. He is now over sixty years of age, of pacific temper, and popular in Hejaz. During the first five years of his rule he posed as the close ally and representative of the Ottoman Government. It was in this character that in 1910 he dispatched his second son, l Abdallah to Qasim with a large force, nominally to assert the rights of the Ateibeh tribe, but really to wrest the district from Ibn Sa'ud, and subject it again to that dependence on Hejaz in which the Egyptian forces had left it in the middle of the nineteenth century. The result of the expedition, and the terms arranged by 'Abdallah with Ibn Sa'ud, have been already described. It was also in the Turkish interest, as well as his own that Hussein ibn 'All dispatched ^Abdullah in the same year against the Idrisi, and succeeded, largely owing to the cesation of Italian subsidies, in detach ing the latter's strongest supporters, the Beni Marwan ; he also saved the town of Ibha for the Turks. But since 1913 the attitude of the Grand Sherif has become distinctly anti-Ottoman. He opposed the prolongation of the Hejaz railway from Medina, supporting the Harb tribesmen, over a part of whom he has paramount authority. In 1915 his eldest son 'AH, who habitually represents his father at Medina, mediated between the Harb tribes men and the new Vali of Hejaz, obtaining leave for the latter to proceed on swearing that he had no Germans with him. The Sherif has also refused to call out Hejazi re cruits for the Ottoman armies, and in March 1915 he dispatched his third son, Feisal, to Constantinople, as Deputy for Hejaz, to protest against their enrolment. In fact the inclinations of the Grand Sherif now incline to us, and he is consequently suspected and closely watched by the Turks. His reputation is that rather of a politi cian than a leader of men, but he has much influence among the desert tribesmen. He is ably supported in his present attitude by his son 'Abdallah, who was formerly Deputy for Mecca in the Ottoman Parliament, and is not on good terms with the Committee, having quarrelled with Enver Pasha. 'Abdallah is an experienced soldier and a capable leader ; he is of far stronger character than his elder brother 'Al 7 , and is in fact the most dominant political personage in Hejaz. It was he who was sent in March 1915 on a mission to Ibn Sa'ud to negotiate peace between the Central Emirates. The Grand Sherif at present wields a wide influence extending South to*Wadi Bisheh in Asir, and inland through Qaslm to Sedeir. He is now on good terms with the Emir of Ha'il and his relations with the Emir of Riyadh are not unfriendly. He is keeping in touch with the Pan-Arabists in Syria, and, so far as is known, he has done what lies in his power to prepare for the expulsion of the Turkish forces from Hejaz. The tribes of the Hejaz are as follows :— 1. — H uweitat. It is unnecessary to say more of the Huweitat than that only a small part of the tribe ranges permanently in Hejaz. One small clan, at present under Sheikh Ahmed ibn Mohammed abu Toqeiqa (but rightfully under Shadli Aleian), is scattered along the littoral from Akaba to Na'man Island, its headquarters being at Muweilah and Dhabah. The great Huweitat Sheikhs remain outside Hejaz {see Section VII, under Audah Abu Tayi). 2.—'A tiyah ( B eni). The Beni 'Atiyah are and old tribe closely akin to the 'Anazah. They claim descent from Ma z, who is said to have been brother of 'Anaz, the ancestor of the 'Anazah. A part of the tribe in the Hismah plain, east of Akaba, is known as the Maza, Some Authorities state that the 'Atiyah tribe was the origin of the Huweitat, the Heiwat, theifen KsJs' HEJAZ 811 Terabin, Ma'za, and Tiyahah. Whether or no this be the true explanation of the relation between the Atiyah and the Huweitat, it is certain that their connexion is exceedi ngly close. The two tribes camp in each other's country, and aid each other against common enemies. The 'Atiyah occupy the northern half of the 'Aweiridh Harrah, and are separated from the Moahib Harrah by the hollow plain of the Jau, through which there is a road from Wejh to Tebiik. The Jau is reckoned to be the dividing line between the Ahl es- Shimal and the Ahl Qibli, the northern and the southern Arabs. The 'Atiyah are held responsible for the Hejaz line from Ma' an to Dlr el-Hamrah. The coast from Sheikh 'Antar up to the Gulf of Akaba is in their hands in conjunction with the Huweitat, as well as the high barren hills between the Harrah and the sea. Their rugged mountain district is unsuitable for camel-breeding. Of the ,sub-tribes, the Sidenyin and the Khutheirah inhabit the Harrat Aweiridh, the Sidenyin being at the northern end with the Subut to the west of them. The Ageilab used to be carriers of goods between Ma' an and Tebuk; but the railway must have taken some of their trade. The 'Atiyah are stout in arms. Their foes are the Shammar and the allies of Shammar, the Fuqara, and Wulud Suleiman. With the Fuqura, the 'Ativah maintain an inex tinguishable feud. They rid the Harb and the central clans of the Huteim. Their paramount chief is Mohammed ibn 'Atiyah. 3.—M oahib. The plain of the Jau running through the Harrat 'Aweiridh is counted the frontier between the Ahl esh-Shimal and the Ahl Qibli. To the north lie the Beni 'Atiyah, ta the south the Moahib, who, though they are of 'Anazah descent, being a tribe of the Sba', are Billi by adoption. The Billi and their southern neighbours, the Juheinah, are both of the Himyar stock, and therefore rightly described as Ahl Qibli. The Moahib inhabit the southern part of the 'Aweiridh, a rugged mass of volcanic rock upon a plat form of sandstone. They are sheep-breeders, and are reduced to small numbers, though they were once powerful enough to drive the Beni Sakhr from the 'Aweiridh. Scattered clans are to be found among their kinsmen the Sba', and with the Beni Sakhr in the Belqa. There is besides an ancient colony of Moahib husbandmen, keepers of cattle, in the Hasa, Their dira marches with the Hejaz line from a.little above El-Akhdar to Meda'in ; in the west they go down to the country of the Sehammah, a clan of the Billi, and in summer the Sehammah come up with their flocks into the harrah. 4.—B illi. The Billi are an old tribe of the Tihamah, whose range extends from Na'man Island to Ras Qarqumah (including Hejh) and inland up to the Hejaz railway, a short s ction of which they are charged to guard. Part of the tribe cultivates land in the neighbour hood of Wejh, and carries rice and other commodities for the Wejh merchants to and from Medina and the Hejaz railway. It lives on friendly terms with the Juheinah, but at enmity with its inland neighbours the Fuqara and the Wulud Suleiman. Offshoots of the tribe are found in Sinai, and also in Upper Egypt at Baliana. The Billi in Hejaz number about 600 nomad tents, say 5,000 souls. Their paramount chief, Suleiman Ibn Rufadah, resides at Wejh and is, with his tribe, to some extent, under the thumb of the Turkish Government; but his sympathies are with the Sherif and anti-Turk. There are said to be some thirteen sub-tribes ; but none is an important unit apart from the whole. 5.—J uheinah. The Juheinah resemble closely the Billi, lead the same partly settled life, %nd have the same friends and enemies and the same political sympathies. They are, however, somewhat more warlike a-.d given to plundering perhaps because the Yambo'-Medina road offers them more tempting opportunities than the tracks from Wejh. Being also more concentrated, they are better able to take common action. Their range, along this coast, is from Ras Qarqumah to a little south of Yambo', and inland up to the Hejaz railway. They number about 500 nomad tents, say 4,000 souls. Their former paramount Sheikh, Sherif Ali Ibn Abdullah, of the Erfu'a sub-tribe, lives at Yambo en-Nakhl. He wa^ displaced in 1914 by Sherif Mohammed Ali Bedeiwi, who has the title Emir and a monthly 5 m2 ' mmmm812 HEJAZ stipend from the Turks, in order that he may guarantee the Medina road so far as it lies through Juheinah territory. But he fell out with the Emir of Mecca in 1916 on account of pro-Turkish sympathies and action, and is likely to give way again to Sherif Ali Ibn Abdullah. The Sheikh of the Beni Ghane'm sub-tribe usually fills the office of Emir at Umlejh. There are two main sections, the Musa and the Malik. The first is said to contain eleven sub-tribes, of which the Ghaneim near Umlejh is most important. They range mostly about El-Habl and in the oases of Wadi el-Iss, The Malik has four sub-tribes, all near Umlejh. 6.—hlarb. The Harb are Ahres-Shimal. They are a powerful and warlike tribe of Hejaz and of Nejd, occupying the coast of the Red Sea from gouth of Yam bo' to south of Jiddah and again from south of Lith to near Qunfudah ; the mountain country between Medina and Namas (a Turkish post on the southern border of the Hejaz); and the desert to the north east up to Jebel Abanat. Inland, their country extends just across the Wadi Rummah. Their clans in the Hejaz come under the influence of the Sherif, though they pay him tribute only when it suits them. They are responsible for the safety of the southernmost section of the Hejaz railway, but their connexion with the pilgrim traffic is chiefly of a less respectable kind ; for they rob caravans on the Mecca road, kill and plunder stragglers, and extort money at every opportunity. The Auf and Lehabah clans are noted high waymen, much dreaded by the p Igrimage. The Harb of the Hejaz are mostly cultivators, fishermen, and carriers. The Beni Salim are also camel-breeders ; but none of the Harb are specially rich in camel-herds. The Harb are divided into two great sections, Beni Salim and Beni Masruh, or, accord ing to some authorities, into three, the Beni Amr being reckoned not a sub-tribe of the Masruh, but a third independent section. According to the first arrangement, the two great sections have each two main sub-sections, thus :— I. Beni Salim .. .. .. C 1. El-Marauhah or El-Hawazim, ^2. Beni Maimun. II. Beni Masruh ,. ., ..CI. Beni Amr. (.2. Zubeid. Adopting for the moment this arrangement, we may say in general that $nly the first sub-section is in the main non-Hejazi, the elans of the other three almost all ranging within the province as delimited here. (1) The Beni Maimum range mostly between Medina and Yambo'. Their principal sub-tribes or clans with their chiefs and diras are :— Ahamdah ; 500 men ; eh ©f, Khalil el-Ahmadi; in Jebel Fiqrah betwesn Medina and Yambo'. Subh ; 1,500 men ; chief, Sherif ibn Nami; in Jebel Subh and Bedr Hunein. Rahalah ; 500 men ; from Bir Abbas to Bir ibn Hasani The whole sub-section may number 1,500 tents, say 12,000 souls. Of its sub-tribes, the Suhh are almost entirely nomad and have a reputation for bravery and valour. The other sub-tribes are half-settled, half pastoral, with the exception of the Kuwwad, a clan of menials, camel-drivers, and negroes, divided between the Beni Salim and the Masruh, The Ahamdah are also reported stout and dangerous fighters. Other elans of less importance range near Medina and in and about Jebel Fikra. The Beni Salim seem to own not pramount chief ; the Sheikhs of the Ahamdah and Stibh have the most influence. (2) The Beni Amr own the date-growing district of Fur' near Medina, but their prin cipal Sheikh, Dheifallah ez-Zuweibi, is generally in Nejd. He is about eighteen to twenty ye .rs of age, and a strong partisan of the Sherif. The sub-tribe of the Jahm are Shiahs. The range of this sub-section (or section) is chiefly in the hinterland between the four points Medina-Rabugh and Mecca-Jiddah. Its prinoipal sub-tribes or clans are:— Baladiyah, 400 men ; between Rabugh and Fur\ M iCahbed, 1,000 men ; near Mecca. Humran, 100 men ; between Mecca and Jiddah. Bevi Jabir, 500 men ; near the Humran. Bishr, 200 men ; Wadi Fatima. Ibidak, Jebel Thubrah. Ruhakah, Fur', near Medina,HEJAZ . 813 Manash, west of Madhik, near Fur'. Jahm, between Mecca and Medina in Fur'. The whole section numbers about 2,000 tents, say 16,000 souls. In conjunction with the Zubeid, it is charged with the custody of the Hajj roads from Medina to Mecca; but it closes these as frequently as it keeps them open. (3) The Zubeid are fishermen and sailors along the coast from Jiddah to Yambo'. Mostly settled in village, they are of a stock despised by purely nomadic Arabs. Their paramount Sheikh, Hussein Ibn Mubeirik, lives at Rabugh. His territory extends from Masturah in the north to Quliyah in the south. He is on excellent terms with the Emir of Mecca and in constant communication with him. This is the section of the Harb with which those who do not penetrate beyond the littoral have most to do, and it is the only section which owns an accessible paramount chief, whose word can be taken for the behaviour of the majority of his tribesmen. As has been already said (page ) it is found not only within the above limits, but also south of Lith {see Handbook to Asir). Its principal sub-tribes or clans are;— Sahaf, 500 men ; in Jebel Gharan. Usum, 80 men ; at Khalis. Mugharihah, 50 men ; between Jiddah and Rabugh. Sct'ayadah, 50 men ; between Jiddah and Rabugh. Wiffiyan. Jathathihah, in Kadoid. J id? an, Thahaban to Jiddalu Hamud. Jerajirahf 80 men ; near Khalis, Izarah, 80 men ; near Khalis. Wildiyah, near Khalis. Yahadhah, 100 men ; in Towal. Vslan, 100 men ; from Rabugh to Thahaban. Some authorities reckon to it also the notorious Auf with its three sub-clans, the Suwaid, Lehabah, and Sahliyah, the most dreaded of all the Harb. The whole Zubeid section in Hejaz numbers some 1,500 tents, or 12,000 souls. 7.—A teibah. The Ateibah are the most powerful tribe in Central Arabia, strong in arms and great camel-breeders. Among all the nomads they are second in importance only to the Ana- zah. They occupy the eastern side of the Hejaz, with the volcanic harrahs between the Hajj road and the Central Arabian steppes. But, as has already been said, they do not come strictly within the province as defined for our present purpose, and of the two great sections, the Roqah alone approaches our borders. Its clans, which sometimes enter the Hejaz, such as the Helissah, Meraukhah, Kurzan, Sebbahah, Marashidah, and Smarrah, are small in numbers and breed sheep only. Politically, however, not only the Roqah section, but also the other and more purely Nejd section, the Berqah, has to be borne in mind by any one dealing with Hejaz; since, to some extent, the whole tribe owes fealty to the Emir of Mecca and comes at his call, more particularly if he is at enmity with the Emir of Riadh, towards whom the Ateibah have long been hositle. 8.—Ashraf. The Ashraf in general are the descendants of Hassan, who was son of Ali and Fatima, and through the latter grandson of the Prophet. There are said to be twenty-one clans of this descent scattered over Arabia, of which fifteen live wholly or in part in Hejaz or North-west Asir, and chiefly in and near Mecca. For the most part numeri cally small, they derive importance from the consideration which their individual mem bers enjoy throughout Arabia. The Emirs (Grand Sherifs) of Mecca have been derived from one or another branch of the descendants of Abu Numej (who was of the Qatadah stock) for so many centuries, that succession to this office is, in practice, as much con fined by prescription to two or three only of these clans, as the Sultanate of Turkey is to the House of Othman. The mutual affinities, the interconnection, and the present condition of the Ashraf clans, are not well known ; and many of them* are mere names to us. But something can be said about the chief among them, who are of political or tribal importance. (a) 'Abadilah is the ruling clan at present, being that to which the Emir (Grand Sherif) and his house belong. It is descended from Sherif Abdullah, grandson of Moham-814 HEJAZ med Abu Numej (1631). It was raised to power by Mohammed Ali of Egypt in 1827 during his occupation of Hejaz, in place of the Dhuwwi Zeid who had held the throne feince the letter part of the eighteenth century and also in earlier times. Previously, the Emirate had been with the Dhuwwi Barakat. The Abadilah clan is entirely settled, the bulk of it living outside Mecca south of the Jiddah road. Many of its members hold bffice under the Emrr. {See Section VII, Personalities.) (b) Dhuwwi Zeid. The Dhuwwi Zeid clan, which descends from Zeid, great great grandson of Mohammed Abu Numej, is settled in Mecca. The houses of Abd el-Mutallib and Ghalib are of the Dhuwwi Zeid clan, and there is rivalry and bad-feeling between it and the Abadilah. The only members of the clan who live at Mecca are Sherif Zeid, son of Feisal, a young man of about twenty, and the Sherifa Azza daughter (?) of Sherif Aun er-Rafiq. The latter appears to be a woman of considerable character with a keen interest in politics and some power over the Harb. She is unmarried and about sixty years old. The Dhuwwi Zeid own a large amount of property in Mecca and Jiddah and posses many slaves. (c) Shenabrah. —The Shenabrah, who descend from an eponymous Sherif, Shambar, not of the ruling house, form now a small clan to the south of Mecca, numbering not more than 150 men. Being related to the Abadilah, they support the Emir of Mecca. Sherif Judallahis their head. The Shenabrah are brave and lawless and are generally at loggerheads with the Dhuwwi Surur. (d) Dhuwwi Surur. —The Dhuwwi Surur, descendants of Sherif Surur, who ruled as Emir in the latter part the eighteenth century, number about 200 men and wander over the country to the south of Mecca, being entirely nomadic. They are of the Dhuwwi Zeid stock, and opposed to the Shenabrah. Sherif Dakhan, their chief Sheikh. Sub-clans are Aulad-el-Hassan and Al Aziz. They all obey the Emir, (e) Dhuwwi Barakat. —The Dhuwwi Barakat, descendants of Barakat^ third son of Mohammed Abu Numej, are no longer in Hedjaz proper, where they held the supreme power up to the latter part of the eighteenth century and* at a slightly later period, were robbers in Wadi Fatima. They are said by Burckhardt to have been exhausted by tribal wars of succession. They are now found in north-western Asir organized as a tribe (see ' Asir Handbook.') (/) Dhuwwi Hassan. —^Descendants of Hassan, second son of Mohammed Abu Numej, are also no longer in Hejaz, but in north-western Asir organized as a tribe (see ' Asir Handbook.') Other Ashraf clans of Hejaz, e.g., El-Hiraz, Dhuwwi Ahdel Kerim, El-Hurith, El- Menema, Dhuwwi Jizan, Dhuwwi Judallah y El-Manadil, Dhuwwi Ibrahim, and Dhuwwi Amr, are, apparently, not of actual political importance. 9.— H udheiu. A partly nomadic tribe ranging all round Mecca itself, but chiefly on the road to Ta' if^ via Jebel Qora. Of the same stock as the Juhadlah {q.v.), they are closely allied with these, but foes of the Ateibah and Harb. They go with the Emir of Mecca, but are a predatory lot, who trouble the annual pilgrimage to 'Arafat. There are said to be two sections, of which No. 1 has seven clans ;— Motarafah (Wadi Eatima), Masud (Ria es-Seil), Sowahar (Ria es-Seil), Beni Amer f Metaan (from Mecca to Jiddah); Lahiifan (east of Mecca), Janabir (El-Kor). IS^K 2 has eight clans :— Garhiyah, Marzukiah, Sarwani, Yabkahi, Beni Fahm, Nadwiah, Dadiah, and Abadiah. 10—F aham ( B eni). A small tribe living in Wadi W aghar, to the east of the Juhadlah and between them and the Beni Thaqif. They are entirely nomadic and are noted for their skill in tracking. They are friendly with the Beni Thaqif and Juhadlah and are faithful to Sherif Ali, late Emir of Mecca,, now in Egypt. Their chief Sheikh is Ismail Ibn Dahian. They number about 1,000 men,. Related to the Qureish. 11. J tjhadlah. The Juhadlah are an entirely nomad tribe with no defined limits ; but such boundaries as they have may be said to be, on the north, a line beginning south of Serom, the southern.HEJAZ 815 limit of the Harb ; and on the south, a line running inland Just north of Lith. They occupy all the coast and take a wide sweep inland to the east of Jebel Abu Shok and Jebel Sa'diyah. Their neighbours on the south are the A1 Mahdi and Dhuwwi Barakat, and, to the north-east of Lith, the Beni Faham. They also mingle with the Dhuwwi Surur and Shenabrah to the south of Mecca, and are generally to be found along the road from Mecca to Jebel 'Arafat and east to Shaddad and Jebel Mokram. From Serom to Lith, however, is their original district, their chief centre being round Sa'diyah. They number about 4,000 men, and although good fighters# are not quarrelsome. Their country is a poor one and affords scanty pasturage to their herds of camels in which they are fairly rich. In times of drought they go south to Wadi Dokhah in the Dhuwwi Barakat country. They do not cultivate but buy all their grain fromTa'if or Lith in return for the temin which they sell. They all carry spears and knives, and those who can afford them, rifles. For purposes of internal administration, the tribe is divided into two parts, the one under Mohammed Ibn Said, the other under Mohammed Ibn Hanesh. The former is faithful to the Emir of Mecca. Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Hanesh, who0rules over the A1 Munifiah, dislikes the Emir owing to his habit of commandeering camels when ever his followers go to Mecca, and therefore keeps chiefly to Sa'diyah and the coast. He has made overtures to the Idrissi, but is too far off and too weak to do more than sympathize with him. He was neutral during the Turco-Sherifian expedition in 1910, and removed his tribe into the inaccessible mountains. The two chief Sheikhs are on good terms with each other, and the sub-tribes freely intermingle. They are friendly towards the Dhuwwi Hassan and Beni Faham, but ini mical to the Harb. The Ateibah, though distant, raid them when they stray too' far east. The Hudheil and the- are of one origin and are on terms of the closest friendship. The Juhadlah are hospitable to strangers but have little religion and seldom go on the pilgrimage. In person, they are taller than most Arabs, wear their hair short and are dressed in a red ' Tob ' which reaches from the waist to the knee, the end being thrown over the left shoulder. (а) Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Said, over sub-tribes :— Alianiah. Sheiyniah. Hershiah. Jamshiah. Thabaniah. Hasnaniah. Jirshiah (б) Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Hanesh, over :— (1) A1 Munif, of which the chief sub-divisions are :— A1 Es-Sihim .. .. .. .. Mohammed Es-Sultan. A1 Madathir .. .. ,. ., Hussein Ibn Haneish.

They are a poor and down-trodden people, thoroughly awed by their power ful neighbours the Dhuwwi Hassan. They do not number more than 200 souls. Chief Sheikh, Mohammed Ibn Qasim. Chief clans :— El-Mujeishah, Ahmed Ibn Masudah. Al Hassan, Ibn Ahmed Er-Rideini. 13.—S aad (B eni). A tribe of Southern Hejaz, tracing its descent to Himyar. It is bounded on the north by the Nasri, on the south by the Beni Malek, east by the Shalawah, and west by the Beni Faham and southern Juhadlah. Their country is more fertile than that of their northern neighbours, wells being plentiful, and they raise cereals and fruits. There are no nomads amongst them. They favour the Emir of Mecca and can provide him with about 1,000 men. Hamsa Ibn Mohammed is their chief Sheikh. There is enmity between them and the Shalawah, and with the Juhadlah they are by means friendly. They combine with the Beni Thaqif, Beni Malek, and Nasr, in times of danger.816 HEL—H1B 14.—T haqif (B eni). A tribe, descended from Himyar, in the highlands to the south of Taif. They are bounded on the north by the northern section of the Juhadlah, on the south by the Beni Nasr. east by the Shalawa, and west by the Beni Faham. They are almost entirely settled and agricultural and grow cereals, grapes, and other fruits for the Ta'if market. For water they depend partly on the summer rains, but chiefly on well-water. Nasir Ibn Ghawal is their chief Sheikh, a firm adherent of the Emir of Mecca. He commands about 2,000 fighting men. In times of crisis they combir^ with the Beni Malek, Beni Saad, and Beni Nasri. They are always at feud with the Beni Faham, and are not cordial to the Juhadlah. They possess very few camels. A certain proportion of the tribe lives permanently in Ta'if. The chief sub-tribes are Sufian, Moadher, and Rahiah, 15.—M alek (B eni). The Beni Malek of the Hejaz {see ' Asir Handbook ' for the Asiri tribe of the name) are a small tribe numbering not more than 2,000 men who live in the mountains inland of Lith. The adjoining tribes are the Beni Saad on the north, the Shalawah nomads on the east, the Zahran on the south, and the Juhadlah on the west. The Beni Malek are not a fighting tribe, but they are hospitable and industrious and cultivate figs and grapes in the wadis as well as wheat, barley, and dura. During the pilgrimage season most of them go to Mecca and Jiddah and act as porters. They thus come more into contact with the outside world than most tribes, and are more civilized. They are devoted to the Emir of Mecca and pay him taxes. Nasir Ibn Rawwaf is their chief Shaikh. They live at peace with their neighbours, except the Shalawah, who occasionally raid them. Most of their villages are culstered in Wadi Luz and Wadi Ruma'an. 16.—N asri (B eni). A tribe, descended from Himyar, in the country to the south of the Beni Thaqif in southern Hejaz ; bounded on the north by the Beni Thaqif, south by the Beni Saad, east by the Shalawah, and west by the Beni Faham. They are entirely agricultural and settled, and raise cereals and fruits, utilizing the water from wells in addition to the yearly rains.

Sixty years ago they were an independent tribe, Ghafiri in politics and Sunni in religion, regarded as cognate with the Janna- bah; but since that time they have partially lost their separate existence, those of Barr-al-Hikman having attached themselves to the Bani Bu 'Ali, while others have become Hinawis under the protection of Shaikh Zaida-bin-Khalifah of Abu Dhabi to whom they pay annual visits and from whom they receive presents. Mahot is their principal settlement. Their number may be 800 souls. Some Hikman are found also at Murbat in Dhufar and at Barkah and Wadi Manumah in Batinah.

Position and boundaries. —The Qadha of Hillah is situated on both banks of the Euphrates below Musaiyib and above Diwamyah. It is bounded on the north and north east by the Qadhas of Kadhimain and Jazirah, both in the_ Baghdad Sanjaq ; on the south-east by the Diwamyah Qadha ; on the south by the Shamiyah Qadha ; and on the west by all three Qadhas of the Karbala Sanjaq. Topography and Tribes.—With, the exception of Hillah Town, described ej^ewhere under its own name, the Qadha contains no very large places ; but the villages of Husain and Imam Hamzah (I), mentioned below, contain each about 2,000 inhabitants. The district is divided into 4 rural Nahiyahs, each containing a number of villages and inhabited by various tribes.824 HILLAH Barmanah, Khawas. Mahawil. Mamduhiyah, Nahr Shah. not been ascertained, making 29 in all. Thir teen of them take directly out of the Euph rates and 16 out of the Nahr Shah, which gives its name to the Nahi- yah. Administration, —Hillah is a Qadha of the 1st class; it consists of a headquarters Nahiyah of Hillah and of the 4 rural Nahiyahs (already mentioned) of Barmanah, Khawas, Mahawil, Mamduhiyah and Nahr Shah, each of which was governed by a Mudir. The relative positions of the Nahiyahs are not altogether certain, but Khawas is evidently upon the west side of the Euphrates immediately above Hillah Town, while Mahawil apparently extends up the eastern bank from Hillah Town to the northern limit of the Qadha. The Nahiyahs of Barmanah and Mamduhiyah seem to succeed one another in this order on the left bank of the Euphrates below Hillah Town, Nahr Shah being partly opposite to both of them on the other side of the river. The Turkish Dairat-as-Sanlyah formerly owned various estates in the Qadha ; among them are the Muqata'ahs or tracts of Abu' Arais, Abu Gharq,'Ilaj, Umm-al-Hawa, Malih and Yusufiyah. They are said to be cultivated by Arabs of the Ma'adan tribe, and are all situated in the lower part of the Khawas Nahiyah and watered from the Shatt-al- Hindlyah. HILLAH TOWN— One of the most important towns of 'Iraq at the present day; it stands upon both banks of the Euphrates about 30 miles below Musaiyib and perhaps 65 miles by the course of the river above Dlwaniyah Town. A road, unmade but fit for driving, and a service of public conveyances connect it with Baghdad City about 60 miles distant. The principal part of the town, called Shamiyah (because it is the nearer to the Syrian desert), stands on the right bank of the river, of which the bed is here about 100 yards wide, and is connected with the eastern portion, called Jazirah (because situated in Mesopotamia), by a bridge of 15 boats. In summer the river bed is now entirely dry, and the people of Hillah obtain their drinking water by digging holes in it to an average depth of 3 feet. Both parts of the town are largely constructed of ancient bricks dug up on the adjacent site of Babylon; the only features of architec tural interest belong to the western quarter, namely a tall minaret in the centre and a mosque called the Masjid-ash-Shams outside the north-western gate on the road to Karbala. The town of Hillah stands towards the upper end of a magnificent stretch of date trees that fringes the banks of the Euphrates for some 30 miles; it is estimated that the town itself possesses 65,000 palms and that the district has not less than 333,000. The population is 30,000, and more than three-fourths of the whole are Shi 'ah Arabs » the remainder are mostly Sunni Arabs, but there are perhaps 750 Persians, 30 Oriental Christians, and 20 Punjabi and Kashmiri Indians, besides a dozen Afghans. Among the Persians are included a few Baluchis, who are Persian subjects./ HIL-HTL 825 Surrounded by gardens and fruit-trees, Hillah is the centre of a district which produces wheat and barley in abundance; and a surplus of these, as well as of dates, is ordinarily available for exportation. The agricultural prosperity of Hillah is however on the decline in consequence of the failure of the Euphrates and may con ceivably become, at no very distant date, a thing entirely of the past. At present, it is calculated, the following supplies, could be collected at Hillah in a week if the condi tions were favourable ; 400 tons of wheat, 600 tons of barley, 100 tons of rice, 1,000 oxen and cows, 600 buffaloes, 300 horses, 1,000 donkeys, 50 mules, 700 camels and 5,000 sheep. The covered bazaars are extensive and well-stocked, containing it is said as many as 2,000 shops ; they furnish all ordinary articles and some of European manu facture. The number of 'alwahs or grain stores is stated at 120, of coffee shops at 20 and of khans or caravansarais at 18. There is also a warehouse for the storage of petroleum. Hillah imports piece-goods and some other merchandise from Bahgdad City, but the rest of its trade is with Kufah on the Shatt-al-Hindiyah, a means of communication being provided by marshes which in some seasons extend from the Hindlyah to within about 4 miles of Hillah. The chief exports are barley, wheat, dates and ghi; the principal imports are piece-goods, sugar and coffee ; the only manufactures of importance are a fine felt, used for rugs and for horse-furniture, and a particular kind of Arab saddle. Hillah is the chef-lieu of the Qadha of the same name in the Sanjaq of Diwaniyah and is a municipal town. Under Turkish rule Hillah was probably, after Baghdad and Basrah, the most important military station in 'Iraq. The old Turkish barracks, well built of Babylonian bricks, are in the western town and form the back of a .large open square which fronts the river at the boat bridge. The Sarai or offices of the former Turkish civil administration consists of a large block of buildings in good repair a little to tho north of the barracks. There are a telegraph and a post office. Schools number 3 and mosques nearly 30. Hillah stands amidst historic sites. The ruins of Babylon begin only 3 miles to the north, while the Tall Nimrud or prominent mound which marks the place of the ancient Borsippa is 8 miles to the south-welt; and Hashimiyah, the first capital of the 'Abbasid Khalifahs, is believed to have stood about 10 miles to tho northward, a few miles to the east of the Euphrates. The eastern quarter of the town existed already, as Jami'an in the 10th century A. D. ; and Hillah proper, on tho west bank, was founded in 1102 A. D. The name means '' The Settlement.''

It may, however, be noted that in pre-Islamic literature and records the pure Arab aborigines of Arabia were called Himyarites. Their first settlements were in the south-west of the peninsula, that is to say in the Aden Protectorate and Southern Y emen. The term Himyar, meaning dusky or red and suggesting, as does the Himya- ritic language itself, African affinities, was sometimes used for the ruling class and some times for the whole nation. HINA (B ani)— Singular is Hinai, A tribe of Yamani descent in the Sultanate of 'Oman, Ibadhis by religion and belonging to the Hinawi political faction. . The Bani Hina are found principally in Hajar and in 'Oman Proper. In Hajar they occur at Qurain (100 houses), Habbas (80 houses), Haili (200 houses), Qadtmah (40 houses), Jammah (50 houses), Naghzah (50 houses), HarithTyah (20 houses), and Khodh (120 houses), in Wadi Samail; at Hajrat-ash-Shaikh (50 houses), Harat-al-Jabah (80 houses), Saqairiyah (30 houses) and Shabaikah (40 houses) in Wadi Fara' ; at Hawaii (45 houses) and Hoqain (200 houses) in Wadi Bani Ghafir ; and at Khan (40 houses) in Wadi-al-Jizi. Their chief centre is Nizwa in ''Oman Proper where they have 300 houses ; at Bilad Sait they have 40 and at Ghafat 50 houses ; and Jabal-al-Kor is regarded as being in their country. Bani Hina are found also at Liwa Town (160 houses) in Batinah, and at Hail (100 houses) and Dham (80 houses) in Dhahirah. The Bani Hina number in all about 9,000 souls. A few of them at Nizwa belong to a section called Hawaqinah ; and the Jabur, whom we have treated as distinct, are perhaps a branch of the tribe. The Bani Hina are brave and warlike and are at feud at the present time (1905) with the Jannabah, Daru'*and Bani Kalban. The Hinawi faction, formed in'Oman at the beginning of the 18th century, derived its name from the Bani Hina, whose chief Shaikh at that time, Khalf-al-Qusair, was the first Tamlmah or generalissimo of the whole faction. The Shaikh of the Bani Hina from 1881 to 1894 was Hilal-bin- Zahair, a descendant of Khalf and, like his ancestDr, noted throughout 'Oman for his resolution and daring : the headship is now held by his sons, who reside at Nizwa.

Resources. —Date palms are estimated at 400,000 trees. Rice was formerly the chief crop of the Qadha ; but the upper part of the district in the neighbourhood of TawairTj town, formerly marshy, is now drying up, and the place of rice in that part is being taken by other cereals. There is nothing remarkable about the livestock. HINDIYAH (S hatt- vl)— A great waterway in 'Iraq, formerly a canal but now become a river: it leaves the right bank of the Euphrates at a point about 5 miles below Musaiyib, and draws off at the present time nearly the whole stream of that river. The Hindiyah barrage. —The angle contained between the Euphrates and the Hindi- yah immediately below the point of bifurcation is acute. At a short distance within the entrance of the Hindiyah, the banks being here about 200 yards apart, it is spanned by a large Saddah or barrage built of massive limestone blocks : in the centre of this work there is now a gap about 20 yards in extent. As there is a concave flexure in its lower or downstream aspect the length of the barrage must exceed 200 yards. The water rushes in a rapid—almost in a waterfall—-through the gap and trickles over the wings, and a deep whirlpool is thus formed on the lower side in which the dancing Quffahs of fishermen may often be seen. A village called Saddah stands on both sides of the Hindiyah at the barrage : on the right or western bank are some 50 houses with shops and cafes ; on the left bank are about 25 houses, including the quarters of a superintending engineer and his establishment. Topography of the Hindiyah proper. —The principal features of the Hindiyah in the next 68 miles of its course can be most conveniently explained by means of a table, as follows;— Name. Position. Nature. R emarks. Mshorab Canal ,, Takes off from the right bank about 7 miles below the barrage. A canal, sometimes dry, of which the bed is 15 or 20 yards broad and 10 feet deep. I Much water runs to waste through this canal and helps to flood the country to the south-east of Karbala town. The substitution of rice for barley on theHINDIYAH 831 Name. Position. Nature.

A village of about 40 mud huts, standing on a mound. The people own some buffaloes, sheep and donkeys, and some work as boatmen when the country in the neighbourhood is flooded. The donkeys are hired out to pilgrims to Karbala. The route between Karbala Town and Tawairij passes the south side of this village at 6 miles from the former and 7 from the latter place. The Hor-al- Husainiyah extends away to the south west of the village; and there are other swamps adjoining. pawaihiyah Canal Takes off from the right bank about 2 miles below the Mashorab canal. A canal about 25 yards wide with banks 7 or 8 feet high : in winter the water in it runs 3 or 4 feet deep. This canal goes to the south-west. The Dawaihlyah has a branch known as the Abul Khasawi which communi cates with the swamps adjoining Sulaimamyah vil lage. Similar to the Masho rab canal above. Near this canal is a village, called Bani Salah with culti vation of wheat and barley : the people, probably of the tribe so named, are about 200 souls. A little south of the canal is Umm Jamal a village of 400 inhabitants who grow cereals, dates and melons.

Midway between the Dawai hiyah and the 'Abd 'Auniyat, near the road is a village called A1 Bii Sah- wah of about 250 inhabitants: the people are garden ers, cultivators and boatmen. A mile and a half from Al Bli Sahwah on the way to Tawai rij is Ibn 'Amti a small hamlet of market gardeners; and about 2 miles south-west of Tawairij on a branch of the 'Abd 'Auniyat is Rajibah, a place partly culti vated by the Jalihah where there are some gardens.

A canal which, with in a few miles of its head, is 40 yards wide and 8 feet deep. Not far from its head it throws off, from its right bank, a considerable dis tributary called Zibdiyah or Zibdlyat which is about 12 yards wide and 3 feet deep, A little below the point of separation of the Zibdiyah there is a village of the Qarait tribe upon the Shatt-al-Mulla. On the left bank of the Hindiyah, oppo site the Shatt-al- Mulla, and between TawairiJ and Hillah, is a tract of land known as Mahannawlyah and watered by a canal of the same name: it produces wheat, barley, millet mash and beans. A remarkable mound on which are Baby lonian ruins. This is the ancient Bor- sippa. R emakes. is spanned by a boat bridge of 21 pon toons : here the water flows strong and deep between firm banks. This canal is said to curve round west wards and then southwards, passing close to Khan Ha mad and Khan Musalla on the route from Karbala Town to Najaf Town and eventually rejoining the Hindiyah near (probably just above) Kufah. In going from Najaf Town to Kifl this canal is crossed at about 7 miles from Najaf ; at the crossing placo it has easily sloping banks, runs about 50 yards wide and 2 feet deep, and is about J of a mile west of the Hin diyah. A little way above Tall Nimrud the left bank of the Hin diyah is broken by an inlet called Guss, Water leaving the Hindiyah by this opening forms a large lake or swamp between the Hindi yah and the road connecting Tawairij with Hillah Town. A part of this watery region is apparently called 'Aufi. Hp834 HINDIYAH Name. Kifl .. Kufah ,. Abu Sikhair Position. On the left bank , 12 miles below Tall Nimrud.

The stream is 200 yards wide here, and there is much culti vation especially upon the right bank. About 3 miles below Kifl, near the right bank, is the village of 'Amran consisting of a few Arab huts and 1 walled and fortified enclosure. The Abu Shurah canal, which waters the Hor-ad-Dukhn tract and is noticed in the article on the Qadha of Najaf, takes off from the left bank in the same vicinity. About 4 miles below 'Amran again is a place where the Hindiyah narrows down to about 80 yards; here the banks rise 100 feet above the water. At Kufah, where there is a boat bridge of 16 pon toons, the Hindiyah is about 150 yards wide and flows in winter with a maxi mum depth of about 6 feet; but a quar ter of a mile above the bridge the breadth of the stream is nearly twice as great. .

A prosperous village, the property of the Darat-as-Saniyah ; it has about 1,500 inhabitants, some of whom are Balu- chis under the pro tection of Persia. Like Abu Sikhair this village lies in the Qadha of Sha miyah. mediately above Abu Sikhair; this useful public work also belongs to the Department of the Civil List. Ja'arah has three mosques and about 100 shops. About 15 miles below Kufah the Hindlyah enters the Bahr-an-Najaf, which is described below and in the article on Najaf Town. Banks and country adjoining the Hindlyah proper. —The country on both sides of the Hmdiyah from its head down to Tawairij appears to be generally firm and dry; but as has been indicated above, there is considerable flooding due to unskilful management ot canals between the lower part of this reach and the town of Karbala. The rest of this r e g ion is becoming gradually less and less moist, and rice is being supplanted here as the staple crop by other cereals which require less water. Between Tawairij and Kifl the country to the west of the Hindiyah is flat and some what sandy, but it is well cultivated and is liable to inundation in floods ; the camel- thorn grows throughout it in profusion. The corresponding stretch on the east side of the Hmdiyah consists of impassable and almost continuous swamps. Below Kifl as far as the Bahr-an-Najaf lands between the right bank of the Hindiyah and the Shamiyah Desert appear to be stable and firm, and as far as Kufah they are well cultivated ; but their present character below Kufah and that of the whole country on the left bank below Kifl are not well ascertained. The right bank of the Hindiyah appears to be fairly well consolidated throughout and it is possible for caravans to travel parallel to it at no great distance from the stream ; . ^ ^tween Tawairij and Kifl the route runs as a rule at some three or four miles m and, chiefly (it is understood) because the canals which have to be crossed are unbridged near their heads: between Kifl and Kufah the road appears to follow the actual right ^ . s ^ a ^ e COmmun ications upon the left bank has not been recently investi- rr-a » ^ seems clear that for the greater part of the way between Tawairij and Imik ' 16 n0 P ossibilit y travelling by land in the neighbourhood of the The Bahr-an-Najaf.—In order to reconduct the waters of the Hindiyah into the Jbuphrates, we may now follow their course across the so-called Sea of Najaf, which a ^ 15 miles below Kufah, to Shinaflyah—a distance of about 21 miles. e a r, even when it contains most water, is shallow ; and it is reported to be steadily si tmg up: as a lake it now exists from January to May only, and during the other mon s of the year the greater part of it disappears leaving merely a stream or channel wate r, owing to the gypsiferous character of the region in which the lake is situated. 5p2836 HINDlYAH is almost undrinkable. When the lake is at its highest navigation is somewhat dan. gerous, especially at night; and a sort of primitive lighthouse to aid belated voyages is (or was formerly) maintained at its southern end by the inhabitants of Shinaflyah. The Bahr-an-Najaf did not exist in the middle ages ; or at least it had not apparently, any existence separate from the Great Swamp in which the Euphrates, in those days, disappeared at a short distance beyond Kufah. The ' Aishdn. —The channel by which the bulk of the water issuing from the Bahr-an- Najaf is carried to the Euphrates is known as the 'Atshan. Its course is extremely winding and measures about GO miles. At about 2 miles below its exit from the Sea of Najaf stands the village of Shinafiyah, on both banks, and here there is a boat bridge of 12 pontoons. Ten miles below the present Shinafiyah is the deserted site of a former village of the same name. The junction with the Euphrates now takes place about 5 miles before the town of Samawah is reached and not, as at the time when the survey of 1860-65 was made, about 10 miles after passing it. The 'Atshan has a northerly branch of some importance known as the Abur Raf ish which reaches the Euphrates by an independent channel, but its course has not been clearly described. Irrigation and cultivation. —Exact information is wanting as to the amount and value of the irrigation dependent on the Hind : yah, but it appears to be both extensive and successful. The date palms on the Tawairij to Kifl section of the Hindlyah are estimated at 400,000 and those on the Kafah reach at 170,000. Rice used to be grown extensively on the Hindlyah about Tawairij and even above it; but the effect of fthe barrage, though now broken, has been to reduce irrigation in the upper reaches and to drive the rice-growers further down stream. The principal canals derived from the right bank have been described in the paragraph on topography above; those on the left bank are not well known. To the list of right bank canals should be added, perhaps, the Si'adah. This canal skirts the Shamiyah Desert, running more or less parallel to the section of the Hindiyah between Tawairij and Kufah ; its source and ending have not been exactly ascertained ; in its lower course, however, it is probably fed by inlets from the right bank of the Hindlyah. In the neighbourhood of Najaf Town it is sometimes empty and appears to be broken ; it passes 4 miles to the east of Najaf, and where crossed by the Najaf-Kufah road it is 40 yards wide from bank to bank, and about 50 feet deep. To :speak generally, the country on both sides of the Hindiyah is well cultivated; but it is liable to be flooded when the stream rises above its normal level. Navigation.—The breadth of the Hindlyah, as we have seen, varies from 80 to nearly 300 vards ; its bed contains many shoals and shallows ; the current in midwinter runs on the average about 1^ miles an hour. It is navigable throughout by safinahs of medium size, of which about 20 are generally obtainable at Tawairij, and it could probably be negotiated by river steamers of 2 or 3 feet draft. River traffic between the towns of NasirTyah and Musaiyib now generally follows the Hindtyah line, the couse of which we have just traced; but in the dry season large vessels, that is vessels of a carrying capacity of 400 ' sacks ' and upwards cannot ascend above Shinaf iyah or sometimes even Samawah ; rand bulk must in any case be broken at the Hindiyah barrage, cargoes being there transferred across terra jirma to boats on the upper Euphrates. Between Tall Nimrud and Shinafiyah journeys are generally made by boat; for roads are few and unsatis factory, and where they exist they are unstaged and somewhat unsafe. Hydrographical changes, —The alternation of the Euphrates between two courses dividing at a point a few miles south of the present Musaiyib is an interesting historical and hydrographicalproblem. It seems clear that before the 9th century of the Christian era the main stream of the Euphrates flowed past Kufah and must therefore have followed, more or less, the course of the present Hindiyah. The bed of the modern Euphrates by Hillah Town, however, existed even then as the Suran canal; and in the 9th centurv the Hillah channel became, or had become, more capacious than that which went by Kufah, By the 12th century of the Christian era the Hillah channel had come to be regarded as the main Euphrates river, and so matters remained until the end of the 19th century. At the time of the British survey, made in 1860-65, the Hillah channel still carried the bulk of the river ; but the Euphrates was now apparently show ing a tendency to return to its old, original bed, for a barrage (marked as 'Umr Pasha s Sadd) already existed at or close to the site of the present Hindiyah barrage, near the head of what was still the Hindlyah canal. At some time between 1865 and 1890 the Euphrates succeeded, notwithstanding the Sadd, in entering the Hindiyah, whichHINDlYAH 837 being nearly straight in its uppermost reaches had a rapid flow and was quickly scoured out to a greater and greater depth ; in this way, assisted by the silting up of the Hillah channel, it soon attracted to itself the bulk of the river, and the country along its course was submerged and temporarily ruined. The construction of the present barrage was next undertaken by the Turkish Government with the assistance of M. Shouderfer, a French engineer; a brick monument now standing on the high spit of land which divides the two channels at the point of their separation records the date of this work as 1303 A. H. (1890-91 A. D.). The barrage, while it remained entire, raised the level of the upper river by about 2 metres and caused about J of the water of the Euphrates to pass slowly down the Hillah channel. In July 1903 the central portion of the barrage gave way; the work became practically inoperative; and the Euphrates, after the interval of a millennium, resumed its ancient course. The New Hindiyah Barrage. The new Hindieh barrage spans the Euphrates river five miles below Musaiyib. It is about 45 miles by road from Baghdad. It is some 800 yards above the old Hindieh barrage (which is actually a weir, badly breached). The latter is the construction usually shown on current maps. The new barrage was completed in December 1913. The new Hindieh barrage is a brick superstructure resting on heavy concrete founda tions ; it has 36 arches each 16 ft. 6 in. wide, supporting a concrete roadway, 12 feet wide, and capable of carrying heavy artillery and heavy motor traffic. The width of the Euphrates at this point is about 280 yards. Between the eastern end of the barrage and the left bank of the river, is 26 feet wide navigation lock; the roadway crosses this by a double leaf steel lift bridge. The 36 arches allow the free passage of the full discharge of the Euphrates in flood. During flood period the barrage acts solely as a bridge and not as a weir or dam. Each arch is provided with two steel gates huag in vertical grooves built into the piers and abutments; the gates are lifted or lowered by specially designed hand-power winches travelling on rails laid on two prallel walls built on the upstream side of the roadway and running the full length of the barrage. As the river falls, the barrage is brought into operation by lowering some of the gates and gradually extending this to all of them, so that at low-water season, the 72 gates are all in action, the object being to maintain the water above the barrage at such a level that the numerous canals and especially the Hilla canal may be able to draw a continuous supply from it. At such a time the barrage becomes a weir for at no period can it act as a dam and prevent some (and in highest season the greater) proportion of the water over topping the gates and continuing its course down the Euphrates, or rather the Hindieh branch of the Euphrates. The water above the barrage can be maintained, during the low-water seaion, at somewhere near high flood level. The difference in level, for practical purposes, of the water on the upstream side and that on the downstream side can be as much as 21 feet. The locks (a tier of two) form the connection for navigation between lower and upp 51* levels. The locks are each 164 feet long by 26 feet wide and at the most unfavourable period give 5 feet depth of water on the cill. This depth can, if required, be quickly increased by manoeuvring some of the barrage gates and allowing more water to pass to the downstream side through the arches. Each lock is provided with the usual type of steel dock gates and sluices, all worked by hand. ' Although the new Hindieh barrage was especially built for the needs of the Hilla canal (which runs through Hilla, Diwania and reaches the Euphrates again at Samawa) it has also a direct effect in increasing the water-supply to all canals taking off the Euphrates for a distance of some 40 miles above. The Hilla canal is provided 'with a regulator (completed 1913), situated about 500 yards above the new Hiadieh barrage on the left bank of the Euphrates. The regulator is a brick superstructure, on a brick and concrete foundation. There are 6 arches, each 10 feet wide, and a navigable opening 26 feet wide. The arches are provided with steel gates, similar in design to those of the new Hindieh barrage, and a travelling winch. The regulator carries a 12 foot wide concrte roadway, which crosses the navigable opening by a steel double-leaf lift-bridge. This roadway will carry heavy artillery.838 HIN-HIR The width of the Hill a canal at the regulator is about 125 feet. So far as the writer knows, through navigation on the Euphrates is still impeded by the old Hindieh barrage or weir. During flood period 30 ton mehalas (empty) can be, with risk, hauled up over the weir. Except chaktours, no loaded craft can with safety negotiate this weir on a downward journey. The old barrage was badly breached in three places in 1914 and it is possible that the 1915 and 1916 floods have helped to further destroy it. It plays no useful part now and should have been removed on completion of the new barrage, but the Turkish Government refused to sanction the necessary expenditure. HINNA— See Masqat (Bay and Town).

There are said to be 600 houses, and the population has been variously estimated at from 1,600 to 3,000 souls. Hit is connected by telegraph with Aleppo and Baghdad, and there is a post office. General description. —Hit is a small walled town with two gates, built of field stones plastered with mud. It stands upon a mound on the river-bank which is precipitous to the plain, and slopes less steeply to the river. A tall leaning minaret near the river bank is a conspicuous landmark for miles. At the south end of Hit are boat-building yards. There is a khdn below the town. In the neighbourhood of the mound on which the modern town stands are other, somewhat lower, eminences which mar the site of former settlements. To north and south are palm groves. To west near some Imams are the chief bitumen springs, and beyond them a barren desolate plain of sand, clay, and black-seamed rocks. There is a ferry at north end of the town. The Mesopotamian plain on the other side of the river is here quite flat; alittle further down-stream it contains naphtha springs, and beyond these salt lakes. The atmosphere of Hit is smoky owing to the burning bitumen kilns, and the furnaces of the boat-building yards. A strong smell of sulphur (from neighbouring sulphur spring(s and of boiling bitumen pervades the air; it is said to have saved Hit from a cholera epidemic. The ground round Hit is very dirty, owing to the bitumen and sulphur. Supplies and Commerce. —No appreciable amount of supplies for troops can be expected at Hit. The cultivated area near the town is a very narrow strip, which does not produce a surplus for export. Hit owes its existence to the bitumen springs around it, which are said to have been worked here for 5,000 years. The bitumen has a sale in Mesopotamia for caulking boats, binding bricks, etc. Boat-building is an important occupation. The boats are made with branches of tamarisk and mulberry trees interlaced with basket-work of reeds and straw the whole covered with bitumen and sand. They draw 22 inches when laden, and 6 inches when empty. They are exported to other places in Iraq, Earthem pottery is also made at Hit. Inhabitants, —The population consists of Sunni Arabs.

HOBAIDAH— Hodaidah, the only part of Yemen having any considerable commercial importance, is situated on the Red Sea in lat. 14° 47' N. In 1897 the population was estimated at over 50,000, but no census has ever been taken. Bury, 1913, estimates it at 42,000, including a British Indian community of about 1,000 and 100 Europeans, mostly Greeks, who have shops. Somalis, Abyssinians and Arabs from the Hadhramaut are very numerous ; but Arabs from the inland highlands are surprisingly few, Hodaidah has no quay or wharfage, nor any of the conveniences of a trading port; the old primitive wooden pier has fallen into decay. There is a small harbour, available only for the smallest craft, with two projecting moles of stone (each with a light about 15 feet high at the end) and a breakwater and two entrances, of which the northern is slightly the easier of access. After the moles were constructed it was found that the water was not deep enough to allow loaded lighters to come alongside, so the stevedores have to wade, and merchandise for shipment or just landed is dumped down on the beach. Large vessels anchor about 2| miles off in four fathoms ; merchandise is transferred in native craft. Landing is difficult and, at times, impossible with the wind between south and west. The Ottoman Government conceived a scheme for constructing a harbour for Hodaidah, about 10 miles to the north, where there is a deep natural inlet protected by a long spit known as Ras el-Ketib, and this was part of a larger undertaking known as theHodaidah- Sana'a Railway scheme. The harbour was to be linked up with Hodaidah by a metreHODAIDAH 815 gauge line along the spit and thence to Sana'a. Construction commenced at Ras-el- Ketib, and about 5 miles of track were laid, but without providing adequate means for landing and handling material. The war between Italy and Turkey and, since then the European war, have put an end to the scheme for the present, with the net result that what material was not destroyed by the Italian bombardment now lies rusting. Hodaidah has two forts, the north and south, both falling into ruin, but conspicuous from seaward. The houses are tall and are usually of stone or brick, almost everyone having its characteristic wattle shelter on the flat roof where the inhabitants seek the cool air at night. The town is divided into two quarters by a sorni-circular wall which reaches the shore at both ends ; the old town in the space towards the sea consists of tall stone houses, narrow streets, and covered bazaars; outside the wall lies a large area of thatched houses, sheds, and compounds which recall the native villages of Uganda. The town in general is dirty, unsanitary, and unhealthy. There is an open market for the exchange of the natural products of the country — coffee, hides, skins — in an expanse of sand outside the town ; whilst the bazaars, within the walls, for supplies of a general kind, are considerable and well-stocked. In the immediate vicinity of the town are extensive areas of palm grove and garden, but immediately beyond the surrounding country is extremely sterile. The Khedivial Mail Steamship Company steamers call regularly every fortnight and the Florio Rabattino about fortnightly. In normal times there is a fair-sized permanent garrison and, as the town is the point of debarkation of troops and the depot for the stations in the interior, it is always full of soldiers, even in peace times. As to climate, from April to September north-easterly winds prevail, and for the rest of the year, south-westerly. The heat, though great, is, in consequence, not insupportable, even in summer, and the climate of Hodaidah compares favourably with that of Massawah on the opposite coast. But the humidity is great and many people suffer from ague and rheumatism. Harris says, ' after a rainfall, or in the winter, when the westerly winds are blowing, fever attacks the plain like an epidemic.' The water-supply locally is exceedingly poor ; there are some brackish wells in the neighbourhood, but pure water has to be brought from a distance of some miles. The lines of telegraphic communication are: {a) Hodaidah, Sana', Dhamar, Yerim, Ibb, Ta'izz, and Mocha ; (&amp;) Hodaidah, Beit-el-Faqih, Zebid, and Mocha ; (c) Jodaidah, Loheia, and Medi, with a branch to Kamaran Island ; and {d) overland and cable connex ion with Perim. A condenser to turn out 10 tons of water in 24 hours, and a machine capable of mak ing 3 tons of ice per day were installed at Hodeida in 1907. The plant for the above that cost £2,200 c.i.J., at Hodeida was imported from Germany by an Italian firm who obtained the contract from the local municipality. Both the condenser and ice-machine were continually getting out of order, and water and ice were seldom ever pro curable by the public. These machines are no longer there. The work of con struction of the pier at Hodeida after dragging along slowly for about five years was at last completed at the close of 1908. It was then discovered that the pier was quite useless for the purpose it was intended to serve. Owing to the shallow water obtaining it is not possible for loaded lighters either to approach or discharge there. A French engineer obtained the contract for the construction of the pier at a cost of £ T. 15,200 (£ 13,680) but the work was carried out by an Italian who purchased the undertaking from the concessionnaire. Hodeida and Jiddah are not in direct telegraphic communication, the route being Hodeida- Shaikh Said- Perim-Suakin-Jiddah. Since 1907 small quantities of Welsh coal have been imported into Hodeida from Aden for the use of the condenser and ice-machine. As regards the Hodeida-Sana'a railway, only about 12 miles of the permanent way on the Hodeida-Hajailah section have been constructed, and that in an indifferent manner. This work has, moreover, suffered considerable damage from rain and wind. Kamaran. —An island about 45 miles north of Hodeida, about 10 miles by 4.

HOFUF— This town, the capital both natural and administrative of the Sanjaq of Hasa, is situated in the south-eastern corner of the Hasa Oasis at a distance of about 40 miles inland in a south-west by west direction from the port of 'Oqair. Site and surroundings. —The site of the town is rocky but low; it appears to be only a little higher than the waterlogged country which adjoins it. The space covered by buildings is described as oblong, with a length from north to south of 1 to 1J miles and a breadth of J a mile. The land to the south and west of the town is waste and quickly merges in the desert: on the northern and eastern sides cultivation and date groves, approach close to the walls. The springs of Haqal, Umm-al-Jamal, Khadud, Umm-al- Lif, Qasaibah, Luwaimi and Barabar, described in the article on the Hasa Oasis, all rise within a mile of the eastern side of Hofuf, and those of Umm Kharaisan and of Bahair and Bahairiyah adjoin respectively its northern and western faces. A few hundred yards to the south-east of the town are a large well and a group of gardens called Suwaidarah. Graveyards closely surround the town upon most sides, especially on the east, south-east and north-west. Quarters and buildings. —Hofuf is divided into 3 large wards, of which the names are Kut or Kut-al-Hofuf, Rifa ah and Na'athil. Kut, which forms the north-western corner of the town, is really a large fortified enclosure with sides about 600 yards long and completely surrounded by a ditch ; it was formerly inhabited by the Turkish troops, the Turkish official community, and others. It contains a fine Sunni mosque having a dome also another good building which is used as a military hospital, and a couple of forts which are mentioned further on among the defences of the town. On the east side of the Kut, at the north end of the town, is a market place with a Qaisari or arcade of shops. On the south of the Kut, between it and the next quarter, is a date plantation. The Rifa'ah quarter forms the entire eastern side of the town ; it is healthier and somewhat higher than the others, and in it are the residences of a number of the better families. Na'athil includes the southern and western parts of the town and is, in extent, a good half of the place; it is inhabited promiscuously by all classes. As already mentioned, it is separated from Kut by a date grove; and within its limits are enclosed occasional gardens and a few trees, the latter chiefly figs and citrons. The principal mosque of Hofuf, which belongs to the Shi'ah sect and is probably the largest mosque in Eastern Arabia, is in Na'athil. Kut is said to contain about 1,200, Rifa'ah about 2,100 and Na'athil about 1,700 houses. A weekly fair is held in the open space between the eastern gate of Kut and the Qaisariyah, along the edge of the moat running round Kut. The houses of Hofuf are flat-roofed and are mostly built of stone and mud and plas tered with gypsum mortar ; some of those in the Rifa'ah quarter are tolerably good and even handsome, with arches entering into their architecture. Nearly every house possesses a private well about 4 fathoms deep. The streets, except 2 main avenues, are narrow and filthy. The whole town has 8 gates, of which 2, called Bab- ash-Shamal and Bab-ash-Sharq, belong to the Kut. Defences. —Hofuf is enclosed by a thin wall of sun-dried bricks and clay; it is only about 12 feet high and has now no ditch, as it once had, upon its outer side. At the north-western corner of the town the place of this wall is taken by the northern and western walls of the Kut, which are continuous with it but twice as high. The principal military work is the Kut, which forms one of the quarters of the town and has been partially described in that character: the Kut comprises the chief citadel, known as Kut-al-HisarHOF-HOQ 8i7 and 2 minor structures styled Qasr-al-Qubbah and Qasr-al-'Abid. Qasr-al-Qubbah has the alternative name of Qasr Ibrahim, and Qasr-al-'Abid serves the purpose of a jail as well as of a fort. These smaller fortifications are surrounded by moats, now dried and choked up with rubbish. The only detached work is Qasr-al-Khazam, a fort situated a few hundred yards from the west side of the town and having the Turkish cemetery immediately to the south of it. In December, 1912, the military garrison of Kut consisted of one regiment of so-called cavalry, no mounted on mules, 2 battalions of infantry, and 8 machine guns. There has of course been no Turkish garrison here since 1913. Inhdbitanls.—The total population of Hofuf is estimated at about 25,000 souls. The people are a mongrel race and are not divided into any well ascertained tribes, nor are there many foreign immigrants among them. Genuine Persians are not found, but there are a fair number of Arabs from Najd; most of the latter are shopkeepers and camel- owners, but some of them are proprietors of date plantations. There are said to be in the Rifa'ah quarter some 50 families descended from the Ja'far section of the Shammar tribe. About three-fourth of the people are Sunnis; the rest, with the exception of a few Wahhabis, are Shi'ahs. There are 2 large Sunni schools called Madrasat Shaikh Abu Bakr and Madrasat Shaikh 'Abdul Latif, at both of which boys from Bahrain, Masqat and other distant places are received and educated. The principal Shi'ah schools are those of Shaikhs Muhammad-bin-'Abtan, 'Amran-bin-Hasan, Musa-abu-KhamsIn and Muhammad-bin-Shaikh Hussain. Trade and manufactures. —Under normal conditions there is a considerable trade with Riyadh in Najd whence ghi is received at Hofuf and to which cloth, sugar and rice are sent in return. Before the recent wars in Najd the number of caravans coming into Hofiif from Riyadh was on the average about one a week. Bedouins, from all the sur rounding country supply their wants at Hof af, and a general market is held every Thurs day in an open space outside the town upon the north side which is called the Saq-al- Khxmis ;* but local trade is mostly carried on in private houses. Hofuf is celebrated for the manufacture of elegant 'Abas, richly embroidered with golden or coloured thread, and of brass coffee pots of curious shape which are exported as far as Basrah and Masqat. Administration. —Hofuf is the capital of the whole Hasa district; it is also the headquarters of the Hasa Qadha and of the Hofuf Nahiyah.

The Bani Husain of Al-Madinah have their headquarters at Suwairkiyah ; the former place contains six: or seven families, the latter ninety-three or ninety-four. They subsist principally on their landed property, for which they have title-deeds extending back to Muhammad's day, and also upon religious bequests. At Al-Madinah they live chiefly at the Hosh Ibn Sa'ad, a settlement outside the town and south of the Darb-al-Janazah. There is, however, no objection to their dewelling within the walls, and they are taken to the Harim after death if there be no evil report against the individal. Their burial place is the Bakia cemetery. The Bani Husain are spare dark men of Bedawi appearance and they dress in the old Arab style still affected by the Sharifs; in public they always carry swords even when others leave weapons at home. The town of Suwairkiyah belongs to the Bani Husain, They are said to claim the allegiance of the Bedouin tribes around, principally the Mutair, and their fealty to the Sharif of Mecca is merely nominal. — {Burton, 1853.)

HUSAINIYAH (H or-al)— Or Hor-as-Sulaimaniyah ; see the village of the latter name in the article on the Shatt- al-Hindiyah. HUSAINIYAH (N ahr-al)— A large canal in 'Iraq; it takes off from the right bank of the Euphrates at Musaiyib and runs to Karbala Town where it divides into two branches. The 5R2852 HUSAINIYAH construction of the Husainlyah is said to have been undertaken by order of the Ottoman Sultan Sulaiman T, during his residence at Baghdad in 1544 A.D. j but it is known that the date groves of Karbala were already irrigated from the Euphrates in the 14th century of the Christian era. Course and branches. —The original head of the Husainlyah was above Musaiyib r and gl brick bridge still spans the former bed of the canal close to the west side o£ the town ; the present head is 2 miles below Musaiyib. The course of the canal is at first towards the south-west; but at 7 miles it changes to west-south-west, a direction which it preserves thereafter until Karbala Town is reached at 18 miles from its head. For the first few miles there is little cultivation on either bank ; but it rapidly increases as Khan-al- 'Ataishi is approached. Khan-al-'Ataishi, by Persians called Khan Atishi, is a dilapidated caravansarai standing, on a mound 100 yards from the right bank of the Husain- iyah at 10 miles below its head; it is a square enclosure with sides about 80 yards long and a circular bastion at each of the 4 corners. A mile or two beyond Khan-al- ' Ataishi beign the dense date plantations of Karbala Town; in the midst of these is reached, at 15 miles, a brick bridge known as the Pul-i-Sufaid which crosses the canal. Three miles beyond this bridge the Husaimyah passes the north side of Karbala Town and divides, at the north-western comer of the same, into 2 branches. One of these runs off in the direction of the tomb of Hurr, about 3| miles north-west of the town; it is called the Rashdlyah and is much larger than the other. After running for some distance to the north-west it turns to the south-west and approaches Razazah upon its east side ; in this reach it has the land called Qurtah, inhabited by the Yasar tribe, upon its right bank ; it then turns sooitwards and ends in a marsh called Hor Abu JDibis at a little distance from Razazah. The other branch^ known as the Manaidiyah circles ^ound Karbala; Town upon its western side and then turning soutwards runs to the Hor-al- Husainlyah, or Hor-as-Sulaimainyah as it is also called from a village which is described in the article on the Shatt-al-Hindiyah. The waste water from the HusainTyah, in the neighbourhood of Karbala Town, generally goes to form this Kor-al-Husainlyah, which is fed also by the Shatt-al-Hindlyah. The Hor is a large lake or open swamp on which water fowl may 1x3 seen floating, and it causes the Karbala-Tawakij road to bo dedected to the north at a point about 3 miles from Karbala Town. Dimensions. —The width of the Husainlyah at its mouth upon the Euphrates is only about 30 feet, but at about J of a mile from the intake it has increased to 45 feet,, and at this place the water runs about 4 feet deep in winter and the channel is frlled by it from bank to bank. The Husainiyah branch which goes towards the tomb ©•f Hurr is 24 feet wide and has banks 20 feet high at its entrance, and the stream in it runs about 12 feet wide and 3 feet deep in winter. The Hanaidlyah branch is about 20 feet wide near Karbala Town, and the top of the banks is about 25 feet above the level of the bed ; but the flow of water in it in winter is only about 4 feet broad by 1 foot deep. From Juno to November the whole Husainlyah canal is practically dry. Navigation and communications. —The Husainlyah canal is navigable for vessels of as much as 400 ' sacks ' burden down to the Pul-i-Sufaid ; but, the current being slack r Ihe voyage from the. Euphrates to this place may take as much as 10 hours in the absence of a favourable wind. The Husainiyah is spanned in 3 places by bridges fit for the passage of field guns. The uppermost bridge is the Pul-i-Sufaid, or White Bridge, 3 miles from Karbala, which is a high-arched construction in brick with a roadway about 20 feet wide ; it is now in bad repair. The next is the Qantarat Bab Baghdad or Baghdad Gate Bridge, 2 miles nearer to Karbala ; it is similar in design and materials to the first, but is at present in good repair and is used by vehicles plying between Karbala and Musaiyib; it leads from the right bank of the canal into the town of Karbala. The third is a curious double bridge at the place where the Rashdiyah and Hanaidiyah branches of the canal separate. This last bridge, of which the head on the southern bank of the canal is about 100 yards from the town wall,—an enclosed garden inter vening,—is built so as to cover the whole trifunction of the canal and its 2 branches, and it has thus 3 entrances or exits ; it is in fairly good repair and able to carry carts as well as foot passengers. The Husainiyah, where it lies across the traveller's route, is an inconvenient obstacle ; £or the banks are high, perhaps 15 feet on an average, and descend very steeply to thoHUS-HUT 853 stream. Near villages, however, they are often ramped, and at such places a Quffah also can generally be obtained to ferry passengers and baggage across ; but transport animals must be unloaded and swam. In some parts deep, narrow, unbridged distri butaries make the left bank difficult for mounted men to follow. Cultivation and 'population. —The cultivation upon the upper part of the canal is chiefly of cereals. The date plantations which begin as Karbala is approached present a remarkable contrast to the well-ordered groves of Basrah Town, for the trees are of all ages and irregularly spaced as if self-sown; nevertheless they are valuable and productive. Villages of the Mas'ud tribe, built of thorns and matting, are sprinkled along the banks the whole way from the Euphrates to Karbala ; while here and there is to be seen the more solidly built enclosure of a Shaikh, having towers at the corners for defence. At one place between Khan-al- 'Ataishi and the Puli-i-Sufaid the hamlets are so thickly set as almost to form a continuous settlements HUSAINI YAH (K hor)— This Khor leads from the Shatt-al-Hor and is met 7 miles inland from the Euphrates It contracts in the dry season but always offers an obstacle for wheels.

There are numerous wells in the vicinity, 2 miles inland from the sea, but the water is of indifferent quality. Before Zubarah and D5hah rose to importance, Huwailah was the chief town of Qatar. It is believed that the inhabitants were originally Al Musallam, who were expelled by the Shaikhs of Bahrain, and that thereafter they were Al Bin 'Ali up to about 1850. HUWAILAH— See Dhafrah.

HUWAITAT (T ribe)— A large and powerful tribe scattered over a considerable area of country, extending to the land of Moab on the north ; to the Mediterranean Sea and the northern portion of the Sinai peninsula on the west; to Wajj in Tihamah on the south; and to Jabal Tubayk and the edge of the Ardh as Sawwan on the east. The dlrdh of the Huwaitat however, does not extend towards the south-east as far as Al-'Ula.* Their Mediterra' nean seaboard town is Ghazah, where they are mostly of the Tiaha and Saidiyian sections, the latter occupying the deep, underlying. Dead Sea plain known as A1 Ghor. Round Ghazah they are tent-dwelling husbandmen ; in the Tihamah, nomad herdsmen, except for a few who, living in little clusters of tents in the valleys, cultivate palms and grain. In the Hisma district they are barley sowars; and in the lands between Ghazah and Egypt their clans, the Tayrabln and Suaki, are nomads just as those are towards the Nafud where they are feared cattle-robbers. Many of the Huwaitat of south Palestine are merchants, trafficking more especially with the Bedouin; and some of them have storehouses built of mud. As a general rule the Huwaitat are clumsy in body, having large, bony frames like the Syriain farmers. Their speech savours of peasantry ; in fact they are more like fellahin than Bedouin. Their plough is a sharpened stake shod with iron, and drawn by one camel; and certain of their clans are said to be in the habit of calling in their cattle by ringing a bell. Their origin is obscure, being variously attributed to two brethren who came from Yemen; to Qahtan, also of Yemen; and to the Nasara Their nomad circuit corresponds with that of the western Nabateans, from whom they are possibly descended. Their women are not veiled. Amongst them selves the price of a man slain is five camels. The following is a more recent account of this tribe The Huweitat are a stout and warlike tribe whose country extends from near Teima in the south to Kerak in the north, and on the east to the Nefud and the Wady Sirhan On the west it is scattered down the Gulf of Akaba and through Sinai into Egypt! Huweitat are nomads in the desert north-east of Cairo, and settled as cultivators round Tanta. The Huweitat of Akaba, Sinai, and Egypt have no political link with the Sheikhs whose head-quarters are at or near Ma'an ; but they recognise certain claims of kinship, and if a Huweiti of the Tawayeh or Beni Jazi got into difficulties with the Otto- mon Government, he would seek refuge, if he could escape, in Sinai or in Egypt. The Huweitat have, however, an exceptionally bad name for treachery. They are divided among themselves, and do not respect their own blood-ties. Oneclan will set upon a caravan under the convoy of a rafik of another clan, shoot the rafik, and rob and murder the merchants. On the Syrian side the leading sub-tribe is the Beni Jazi and Arar ibn Jazi is nominal ly the paramount Sheikh ; but he is not recognized by the Abu Tayi, and the two groups are frequently at feud. The Tayi are an off-shoot of the Jazi, and owe their position to the restless energy of their Sheikhs. The present man, Audeh, is one of the most famous raiders of his time, and does not hesitate to carry his expeditions across the Hamad to the Euphrates, where he has raided Ibn Hadhdhal of the Amarat. On one occasion, when he was out against the Sba', he pushed almost as far north as Aleppo. The Huweitat are on close terms of friendship with the Beni Atiyeh, and are at liberty to camp through all the Atiyeh country. The Sheikh Ahmad ibn Tukeika occupies the Red Sea coast between Muweila and Dhaba, with his headquarters at Muweila. They are at war with the Shammar, except the clan of the Rammal, which is connected by marriage with the Tayi; and they are usually on bad terms with the Wulud Suleiman and the Fukara. With the Sakhur relations are always delicate, and the two tribes often break into sharp conflict. In 1914 the jealousy between Ibn Jazi and Abu Tayi led to continuous raids between the sub-tribes. Ibn Jazi took refuge with the Sakhur, and the Tayi with the Ruwalla. But the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey filled the tribes with a common fear that their camels might be requisitioned by the Ottoman Government for transport purposes ; the Huweitat made up their differences ♦ Never so pronounced, but always as al 'Ally,856 HUW—HUW and together with the Sakhur retired east into the Anazeh dira, where the Government could not reach them. They are charged with the protection of the Hejaz Railway from Kerak to Ma'an, and receive a yearly subsidy. Since Sami Pasha's expedition into the desert in 1910, they have regarded Ottoman authority with a certain amount of respect. Audeh's cousin, Mohammed abu Tayi, was imprisoned for several months in Damascus, and upon his release was made responsible for the payment of the sheep and camel- tax of his tribe—a lucrative position which he would be unwilling to forfeit. In the spring the Tayi pasture over the north and east of the Jebel Tubik ; the Jazi camp to the south and south-west. In the summer the tribe draws into Ma'an, where it owns a little cultivation, and to Jafar, a depression east of Ma'an. Ma'an is the northern limit of the sandstone desert. Here the grassy downs of the Beni Sakhr country give place to forbidding leagues of rock weathered into fantastic shapes and diversified by sand-hills. Wells are few ; nevertheless, in the stands tone bottoms there is a suffi ciency of small shrubs and succulent weeds after the scanty rain. The Huweitat are not among the great camel-owners ; probably the whole of the Syrian branch has not more than 5,000 to 8,000 animals. The Huweitat claim to be Ashraf, i.e., descendants of the prophet through his daughter Fatima ; but it has been conjectured that they have a history which is ethnologically of far greater interest. They may be the descendants of the Nabataeans, who held tho caravan road to Yemen—the old spice road—and had their capital at Petra, a few hours west of Ma'an. Tribe, Sub-tribe, Clans, Arar ibn Jazi.

They are not divided into sections properly so-called, but some of them form groups named after a common ancestor, more or less remote, or after the place from which they have come; such are the Al Bu Fakhru group, to which a fourth of the Huwalah settled at D5hah in Qatar belong, and the group of the Kashkunarlyah, who are said to have immigrated from a place Kash- kunar, situated in Gabandi in Persia, inland of the Shibkuh coast. It is uncertain whether the Mahandah and Sulutah, who have preserved their tribal character though according to some accounts they lived for a time in Persia, should be classed as Huwailah or not. The Bani Malik of Qatar, other than the Sulutah, are always ranked among the Huwalah* Religion and characler* —The Huluwah are, as already indicated, all Sunnis; but some belong to the Maliki and some to the Shafi' school for the sect. They have altogether lost their fighting instincts and are entirely given up to commerce, the handicrafts and other money-making pursuits, some on a large and some on a humble scale. Numbers and distribution* —In Bahrain Huwalah are found at Halat-bin-Anas, 10 houses; Budaiya' 50 houses; Hadd, 20 houses; Manamah, 1,000 houses; and Muharraq Town, 2,000 houses* In Qatar there are 200 houses of Huwalah at Dohah and an equal number at Wakrah ; and a few, chiefly artisans, are found at the towns of Hofftf and Qatif* Those of Trucial 'Oman are 300 house-holds and are all settled at Sharjah Town; while those of Sirri, numbering 30 families, are said to be immigrants from Trucial ' Oman.'

The drainage of Ibra goes south-eastwards by Wadi Ibra to Ja'alan and thence to the sea, and the hills of eastern Hajar are distant from the town, on the north and east, about 25 miles. The town stands in a well cultivated area bearing dates, fruits and cereals and measuring several miles in length and breadth ; this oasis is studded with villages of the Masakirah and Hirth. Ibra is divided into two main quarters, viz., the 'Alayah or upper town on the north andeast, inhabited by Masakirah, and the Sifalah or lower town on the south, occupied by Hirth : the separate bazaars of these two quarters are about half an hour's walk apart. The 'Alayah is unwalled; it comprises over 300 houses, mostly of mud and gypsum- stucco, with a few huts and a bazaar of some 30 shops. The number of houses in the Sifalah is over 500, and many of them are excellent, resembling those of Masqat Town. The entire Alayah consists of various small wards which are dispersed in all directions ; but a part of the Sifalah, called Manzafah, is walled and boasts a bazaar of 60 shops* besides a large fort on which some guns are mounted. The other wards of the Sifalah, namely, Subakh, Ahl Sinau and Ma'taradh stand at a few minutes' distance apart from one another. The whole population of Ibra may be estimated at 4,000 to 5,000 persom l whom the majority are Hirth. 5s2860 IRR—I BR Silk and cotton, imported from India through Masqat Town, are woven into cloth at Ibra: thid is a profitable industry and almost the only one exercised.

'Ibri is enclosed, except on the south, by hills rising from 300 to 400 feet above the plain at a short distance from the town. The bazaar and dwellings of the poorer classes form a compact block surrounding the fort; but the houses of the wealthier inhabitants are dispersed and loit to view in a sea of date groves, the most extensive.IBE-IDH 861 probably, in 'Oman except those of Wadi Samail and containing perhaps 50,000 palnfta. Fruit, cereals and grass are largely cultivated, both amidst the date plantations and in the open space beyond them. Livestock are estimated at 30 horses, 400 camels, 300 donkeys, 500 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. 'Tbri contains one of the largest Jami* mosques in 'Oman. The population of the town is estimated at 5,000 persons, of whom at least 3,500 belong to the Ya'anib tribe and some of the remainder to the Bani Kalban. The bazaar is large and good, containing all the commodities for which there is a demand among Arabs. Dates, mangoes, limes, apricots, peaches, and figs are exported ; but the ^ principal local industry is indigo-dyeing. Blacksmiths, carpenters and other artisana are to be found here ; also goldsmiths. In 1885 'Ibri enjoyed the reputation of being a thieves' market for all 'Oman ; at that time all plunder from Batinah or 'Oman Proper was brought here for disposal by auction, but this has now ceased to be the case.

The 'Idan are found also at Kataiban and some other villages on the left bank of the river above Basrah and some are settled at Dorah towards the mouth of the river, not far above Fao. With the'Atub and the Qatarnah they are the principal constituent of the mixed population of the right bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab generally; and indeed it may be said that they are found almost everywhere on both banks of the river above and below Basrah Town. A large number of the tribe some years ago emigrated to Persian territory in order to escape conscription for military service by the Turkish Government; these have mostly been enrolled by the Shaikh of Muhammareh as members of the Muhaisin tribe and have been settled by him as cultivators at Qasbeh on 'Abbadan island and elsewhere. In religion the 'idan are Shi'ah; and by profession, like most of the tribes upon the Shatt-al-'Arab, they are almost as much robbers as agriculturists. Their principal Shaikh resides either on JazIrat-al-'Ain opposite to Magil above Basrah, or at Kibasi-as-Saghir on the main land adjoining that island. tdd— See. Dhafrah.

The so-called 'Iraq is a purely geographical expression, and so far as possible, we shall use it as such only; but occasionally, for political and administrative purposes we shall be obliged to use the term as a synonym for the Baghdad and Ba,srah Wiiayats taken together. Boundariea.-n^q is bounded on the west by theShamlyah Desert, on the south bv the frontier of the Kuwait Pnncipahty and by the waters of the Persian Gulf. On the east its limit is the Persian border; and on the north our detailed inquiries will not extend much beyond the limits of the Baghdad Wilayat. Principality. CommisXnki ^ ^ PerSia ' WaS fixed hy tlie Turco-Persian Boundary . Physiol geography and character.—'Imq is a plain of alluvial clay, unrelieved bv a Single range, hill or natural eminence of the slightest importance. On the east how- ever, the plain is dominated by the hills of the Persian district of Pusht-i-Kuh which snow-clad in midwinter, approach within about 30 miles of the Tigris at 'Ali-al-Gharbi and are m full view,, minmng nearly parallel to the river, all the way between the towns of 'Amarah and Kut-al-Amarah. The chief features of 'Iraq are, of course, the great rivers Euphrates and Tigris unon Which the prosperity and even the habitability of the entire country depend Minor but still important features are the Diyalah, a left bank tributary of the Tieris a sWf way bdow Baghdad ; the Shatt-al-Hindiyah, formerly a canal but now a subslute fol the dried up reach of the Euphrates between Musaiyib and Samawah ; the channel known as the Shatt-al-Gharaf which connects the Tigris at Kut-al-Amarah with the Euphrates at Nasmyah and Hammar ; the enormous marshes upon the lower course of both Euphrates and Tigris from Qurnah up to the towns of 'Amarah and Nasirivah respectively ; the swamps m which the Dagharah canal has its ending and those whMi are said to have submerged a large part of the country between the Shatt^al Gharaf Tigris and Euphrates ; the Jahalah which draws off a large proportion of the Tigris water at 'Amarah Town, restoring part of it to the Shatt-al^ 'Arab via the Suwaib together with the swamps to which this canal gives ri^e: finally a long, but narrow, saline marsh reaching apparently most of the way from Mandali to Kut-al-Amarah upon the Tigris of which the large swamp near Jassan town, known as Hor Jassan, is perhaps a part. ' The soil of 'Iraqis in general a rich clay of fine quality, remarkably free, even in its natural state, from sterilising salts; this statement holds particularly of a large tract to the east of Baghdad City and of the country between the Tigris and Euphrates in the same latitude. Near the Euphrates, however, a saline efflorescence is in places observable • and below Kut-al-Amarah Town, on the Tigris, and Diwanlyah Town, on the Euphrates' the proportion of sand in the soil to clay and humus is said to be excessive, except in the marshes. The valley of the Euphrates is much more extensively cultivated than that of the Tigris ; but a little to the west of the former river, or rather of its Hindiyah branch bedns the irreclaimable Shamlyah Desert. Wherever in 'Iraq the soil is irrigated there is rich cultivation and the date and other trees flourish ; but the productive area is confined in existing circumstances, to narrow belts which adjoin rivers, canals or marshes In a few localities also, especially in depressions, occasional crops are grown by rainfall • but the aspect of 'Iraq remains, on the whole, that of a barren wilderness or Choi of sun-* baked clay, sprinkled with camel-thorn and wild caper and carpeted—but onlv after rain and chiefly on the side towards the Persian frontier—with a little thin herbage Flora. —Natural wooding hardly exists except upon the banks of rivers and canals where the Gharab or Euphrates poplar, a tree that does not attain any great size ^ r ows interspersed with low tamarisk or Tarfah jungle; the Gharab is perhaps the BaWo nian willow of Scripture. There is also a kind of osier or willow, known as Safsaf which gives a good shade. Some of the more important groves upon the Euphrates and Tigris are officially protected and are mentioned further on in this article in connection with the work of the Forest Department; they are sometimes very dense, but they are never exten sive. The white and black mulberry, the ber, and various kinds of acacia (Barham) 5l C52(w)GSB spa866 'IRAQ are among the self-propagating teres of the country, and there is also a mimosa which goes by the name of Shok-ash-Shami. i j j r i A small thorny plant, called simply Sh5k, is common everywhere and affords fuel and camel grazing. In the desert between Basrah and Kuwait are found, in addition to other common forage plants, a shrub called Haram and a grass called Shahbah, both of which are eaten by camels : the leaves of the Haram are small and globular and contain Two vegetable products, natural but possessing a commercial value, are colocynth or Handhal and Sus or liquorice. The colocynth occurs everywhere and is obtamed m large quantities from the waste country between Baghdad and Hillah ; but it is inferior to the Syrian colocynth, and the dried pulp only is exported instead of the whple fruit. The trade in liquorice is dealt with in one of the paragraphs on trade below. The liquor ice plant grows chiefly in river bends, on the concave side of the curves, and is said never to be found at more than two miles distance from the water's edge ; it requires a good deal of moisture and benefits by occasional floods. Its maximum height is about 10 feet, but on the average it does not exceed 4 or 5. Liquorice wood is a staple article oi fuel at Baghdad. - . Fauna.—Wild animals are rare in 'Iraq except gazelles, pigs (which abound m the marshes) and jackals ; hyaenas, foxes and hares also are said to exist. Duck, black partridge and snipe are among the feathered game ; and the bustard is found in the desert, while heron and other aquatic birds are numerous in the marshes. The rivers produce fish, but not many kinds that are good to eat. The best known are the Bizz, which is often 6 to 7 feet long and over 100 lbs. in weight; the Shabut, a fish weighing from 2 to 6 lbs; the Bunni, a smaller but better tasting fish than the Shalrot; Qattan, along, round fish measuring about 4feet; the Jurri, a kind of scaieless catfish about 2| feet long, eaten by Sunni Muhammadans but rejected by Shi ah Muham- madans and Christians: and the Abu Zumair, a mustachioed fish which only the desert Arabs will eat. There are also a fish about 6 inches long, called Biyah, and a kind ot flat fish known as Mazlag. Sharks over 6 feet in length visit Baghdad in the hot season and make bathing in the Tigris dangerous; they have been found as far up stream as Samarrah. . j In the marshy districts mosquitoes abound and sometimes make lite a burden. Minerals. —The minerals of 'Iraq are bitumen, mineral oil, and salt; of these the first two occur outside the limits to which this article is confined, the bitumen at Hit and ' Anah on the upper Euphrates, and the oil at Hit and in the neighbourhood of the Persian frontier at Mandali, etc. The principal salt fields are those described in the articles on the 'Azizlyah, Karbala, Najaf, Nasirlyah, Samawah, Shatrat-al-'Amarah Qadhas ; there is one also, but of less importance, on the outskirts of Baghdad City near the Bab- at-Tilism. It may be added that Juss or gypsum mortar is found in many parts of 'Iraq, especially at Mahmudiyah, Samarrah and Tikrit; that a whitish-yellow clay, suitable fcr pottery, is obtained from the banks of the Tigris ; and that the desert about Baghdad and Ba'qabah yields a clay good for making bricks. Climite and health.—The climate of 'Iraq is on the whole not unhealthy, but it may be described as extreme, for the temperature in the shade ranges at Baghdad City from a minimum of 18-6 0 F. in winter to a maximum of 123° in summer. De cember, January and February are cold, crisp, and even bracing months, during which some rain falls ; March and April are warm and unsettled, with occasional thunder and dust-storms ; May and June are hot but fine, often with a refreshing north-west wind or Shamal at night; in July, August and September the heat is excessive and almost in supportable, driving the inhabitants of the towns to live in subterranean^ rooms ^ or Sardabs by day, and upon the roofs of their houses from sunset to sunrise; during October the heat begins to debate, and in November the weather becomes cool again. More precise details of temperature and rainfall will be found in the article on Baghdad City, the only place in 'Iraq for which exact statistics exist. In 'Iraq the prevailing winds are those from the north-west and north ; but calm weather is the rule. High temperatures accompany the east wind or Sharqi when it blows in the months of June, July and August; and the south wii^d is invariably oppressive and is generally accompanied by dust.4^2 IeIq 867 The foregoing remarks relate primarily to Baghdad City and are not applicable without modification to^ the whole of the 'Iraq. In December 1905 the temperature in the Euphrates region between Musaiyib and Kufah sometimes fell to 18° F. and biting winds blew from the north, but without injury to the health of caravans. The meteorological tables of the Government of India show that the condition of Baghdad as to temperature are very similar to those of Jacobabad in Sind, and that the hot weather is more pro longed and intense than that of the Indian Punjab* At Basrah Town and generally in the region of the Shatt-al-'Arab the daily range of temperature is less, the summer nights are hotter, and the climate is more enervating than at Baghdad. Further meteorological details will be found in the articles on Basrah Town and Fao. Malarial fever in autumn is the principal disease of the country ; and epidemics of cholera, and formerly of plague, have been of not unfrequent occurrence. Other diseases are small-pox and diphtheria, with typhoid, tuberculosis and syphilis in the towns. The celebrated Baghdad boil, described in the article on Baghdad, is hardly known in 'Iraq outside of that city, but a similar affection exists in Eastern Anatolia and at Aleppo, Diyarbakr and other places. Population, —It is difficult to form even an approximate estimate of the population of *Iraq,—an intricate and extensive country, parts of which are hardly ever visited by civilised travellers. In attempting to give some idea of the number of the inhabitants a distinction may first be drawn between what we may call the fixed and the nomadic elements ; and among the former of these will be included not only the residents of towns and large villages but also a very great number of tribesmen who dwell in huts or even tents, yet devote themselves to agriculture and stock-raising and are generally found in the same localities, though not exactly at the same places. The following are three separate estimates of the fixed population in the Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats ;—- 1. IL IIL Baghdad Wilayat .. 276,000 1,365,000 890,000 Basrah Wilayat 935,000 1,500,000 590,000 Total souls 1,202,000 2,865,000 1,480,000 The first of these estimates (total 1,202,000) was deduced by the (German) Baghdad Railway Commission of 1900 from the old Turkish registers ; the second (total 2,865,000) was specially supplied, it would appear, to the same body by the Walis of Baghdad and Basrah ;* the third (total 1,480,000) has been compiled, district by district, from information collected for the Persian Gulf Gazetteer, and a tabular analysis showing how it was reached will be found in the paragraph on civil administration below. The first two of these estimates no doubt include the population of the Kuwait Principality in the figures for the Basrah Wilayat, and to that extent they are excessive as estimates for 'Iraq proper, which indeed they are not meant to be ; but the first, on the other hand, is probably an underestimate for the part of the country which it was intended to cover. Upon the whole the third estimate, referring as it does to 'Iraq only and based on all the available information of every' kind, is probably not very far from the truth. The exact number of Bedouins in 'Iraq is impossible to calculate, and the great majority of those seen in the country belong in reality to Central or Eastern Arabia and have been included already in our estimates of the population of Jabal Shammar and Kuwait. 'See Proceedings of the Government of India in the Foreign Department for May 1901. 5 t 2 m868 IRAQ The true nomads whose homes are in 'Iraq are far from numerous*; and they mostly belong to tribes of which the bulk is fixed or only semi-nomadic. On full consideration of all the acts the population of 'Iraq may be placed at 1,500,000 souls or slightly more, of whom only a very small proportion are wandering Bedouins. ' Urban' population and ' mhan' life. —In approaching the 4 subject of races and tribes among the people of 'Iraq, we may discard the distinction adopted above for purposes of numerical calculation and adopt another more suitable to our new topic one, namely, between 'urban' and 'rural' population. By 'urban' population are meant here not only the residents of towns, properly so called, but also those of per manent villages ; the ' rural ' population is taken to consist of the semi-nomads already mentioned, whose dwellings are huts or even tents, and of Bedouins pure and simple. The urban population, in what follows below, is thus very far from being identical with the ' fixed ' population above ; and similarly there is no correspondence between the ' nomadic ' and ' rural ' populations. The inhabitants of the towns and permanent villages, who thus form by themselves a natural division of the people, may be subdivided according to race into Arabs, Persians, Jews, Kurds, Chald scans, Armenians and Sabians, besides Asiatic and European foreigners. Arabs form the bulk of all the urban communities in 'Iraq with the two important exceptions of Baghdad City and the towns of Karbala and Kadhimain : in the first of these they are outnumbered by Jews, and in the other two by Persians. The distinc tions of the urban Arabs among themselves are mainly religious and will be noticed further on ; but a large proportion of them are descended from the rural tribes, dealt with in a later paragraph, and to some extent preserve their characteristics. The Arab of Iraq is not fanatical, but he is grasping in money matters and frequently overreaches himself by the extravagance of his own demands; he labours also under a rooted disin clination for hard work. At Karbala Town, and at Kadhimain Town as well, Persians predominate in numbers over all other races. There is a considerable Persian colony in Baghdad City and one- eighth of the population of Basrah Town and a considerable proportion of that of Tawairij are believed to be Persian ; Persians engaged in retail trade are found even in such minor places as Rumaithah, 'Ali-al-Gharbi and Qal'at Salih. The Jews are from every point of view an extremely important element in the population, and in the city of Baghdad they are believed to outnumber the Arabs. In 'Iraq, which contains the tombs of Ezra and Ezekiel and reaches to with in a short distance of the tomb of Daniel, the Jews are surrounded by monuments of the Captivity, and this may account for the exceptional bigotry and devotion to the minutiae of their law which they here display. They are almost entirely engaged in trade and money-lending, and many of them are altogether absorbed in these pursuits ; but some of them are men of high and honourable character, in every way worthy of the distinguished and responsible positions to which they not infrequently attain. Many of them begin life as hawkers of stockings and such wares ; all marry young and receive some capital at marriage from their fathers-in-law ; when the latter are too poor to pay, the dowry or Mahr is subscribed by their neighbours. The trade of Baghdad is passing every year more under Jewish control; and many Jews now visit England, and some of them even reside there as business agents for partners or relations. The native Christian merchants of Baghdad have mostly disappeared during the last 15 years in consequence of Jewish competition, and already Muhammadan merchants are taking Jews into partnership as a measure of self- defence ; the Muhammadans, however, are still able to hold their own to some extent in the up-country trade carried on from Baghdad. The leading native firms at Basrah are Jewish also. Jews are found at various other places throughout the country such as Amarah Town, where they have a synagogue and two rabbis ; Kut-al-Amarah, where they have a synagogue; Nasiriyah, Saq-ash-Shuytikh, Hai, 'Ali-al-Gharbi and Qal'at Salih. They venerate the tomb of Ezekiel at Kifl and manv of them are buried there. . n &lt;.1 - Ba fnn)y ay Conimission, already quoted, estimated the ' nomads and semi-nomads ' t ^ ^ a i I ' an ?

'i r 4i •IBxlQ 869 Among the finest classes of men in the towns and villages are the Kurds, most of whom seem to belong to the Faillyah branch of the tribe. The distribution and cha racter of the Kurds is described in a separate article. As an agriculturist in J Iraq the Kurd is said to be inferior to the Arab. The Armenians, of whom there are some at Baghdad, have lost much of their impor tance in trade in consequence of Jewish competition, and with it, to some extent, their position as a community, but some of them are still well-to-do merchants or clerks Chaldaean Christians are not very much in evidence except as domestic servants and upon the river steamers, where they enjoy a complete monopoly as deck-hands and firemen ; those who serve on the steamers are all Talkaifis, or natives of Talkaif, a village near Musal, and strongly resemble one another in their features, which are of an un- mistakeable cast. These Chaldaeans are now improving their position by means of education, and some of the younger generation are clerks in banks, etc. The profession of the law is almost monopolised at Baghdad by the Christian races. It remains to mention the curious sect or community of the Sabians, or Subba, re garding whose religion much controversy has taken place and who are more fully des cribed in a separate article: they are found also in the Persian province of 'Arabistan. The Sabians are an artistic and mechanical people, hardly distinguishable in appearance from their Arab neighbours. The commonest profession among them is that of gold and silversmith, and the silver and antimony ware of the Sabians of 'Amarah Town is celebrated ; but others are employed as gunsmiths, carpenters and boat-builders ; a few are bakers. Their chief settlements in 'Iraq are at Nasiriyah, at 'Amarah Town and at Suq-ash-Shuyukh where their Qari or religious head has his abode : but they are also found at Qal'at Salih, 'Ali-al-Gharbi and Shaikh Sa'ad. See the article on the Sabians. Asiatic foreigners, exclusive of Persians, are generally natives of India, Afghanistan, or the Indo-Afghan frontier who have been attracted to the country by the sacred places of Shi'ism or by the Sunni shrine of 'Abdul Qadir Gilani at Baghdad, and the descendants of such. The Indians are not generally held in much esteem, but the Afghans and Pathans, by their superior physique and force of character, command some respect. It Baghdad there is a considerable body of Afghans and Pathans, mostly employed as watchmen and door-keepers, who have been known, on such an occasion as the. murder of one of their numbers, to occasion anxiety to the authorities by a disposition to make common cause. In the towns and villages of 'Iraq the houses are nearly always built on the same plan and consist of a square or oblong courtyard surrounded by rooms ; in the larger towns the houses are often two-storeyed, and in that case the upper flat has generally a verran- dah which looks into the central yard. Handsome projecting windows called Shan- ashil an Arabic corruption of the Persian Shahnishin, and sitting rooms built across the street at a considerable height above the grounds so as to form a bridge between apartments on the opposite sides are features of the domestic architecture of Baghdad City and are reproduced in some of the other towns. Houses are generally built by the owners who buy the materials and pay daily wages to the workmen,- the architect who directs operations is frequently illiterate and works by rule of thumb without the aid of plans. The members of each of the different races and religions which inhabit the towns generally congregate together in a particular quarter, and as a rule they are recognisable at sight by their dress and general appearance. In Baghdad the 'Aba and Zabun, the outer and inner garment of the ordinary Muhammadan native, have begun to give way, partly perhaps in consequence of the wearing of European uniform by the troops, to Eurpean dress ; the case of foot-gear is similar. Work ceases at sunset throughout the year and few persons leave their houses after dark. Men are never seen abroad in the company of women, not even of their wives or nearest relations. Rice enters largely into the diet of the town classes, among whom the well-to-do mostly have a Pilao or Shorbah at least once a day. Coffee is the universal beverage. ' Rural ' population and ' rural' life. —The people, outside the towns and perma nent villages, are all Arabs, except in some of the eastern districts where thare are Kurds ; and the gueat builk of them—as already explained—are at least semi-settled, and a few only, temporary visitors being excepted, are entirely nomadic.870 The tribal system of 'Iraq, as we must at once warn the reader, is not so exact, so rigid or so well ascertained as that, for example, of the Pathan tribes on the North-Western Frontier of India, or that even of the Bedouins of Central Arabia. Thus it happens that enumerations of tribal subdivisions received at different times or from different sources seldom tally, and that the Turkish Government do not understand, and that the tribes men themselves are often unable to explain, the relationship subsisting between different sections. As concrete examples of the uncertainties encountered we may mention that diverse accounts represent the Dafafi'ah and the Al Ba Darraj as wholly independent tribes and as sections of the Shammar Toqah and BanI Lam respectively; that the Sarai Arabs figure in some statements as a subdivision of the Bani Lam and in others as a section of the Ban! Rabi'ah ; and that the Khasraj are sometimes named in connection either with the Bani Lam or with the Zabaid, and at other times are spoken of as a tribe by themselves. The fluidity of tribal conditions is illustrated by the fact that the Bani Malik, Ahl-al-Jazair and Bani Mansiir, who a few years back were apparently considered to be sections of the Muntafik, are now generally regarded as possessing each a separate existence. Part of the confusion arises from a tendency to class a small tribe which depends upon the assistance of a larger tribe in war as a section of the larger ; and the political allowances which thus partly determine classification are unstable and fluctuat ing. Doubts of the kind we have indicated could be finally settled only by elaborate local enquiries among the tribes. In the present Gazetteer we have been guided by the best opinions available ; but accuracy, in the circumstances, cannot be guaranteed.* The following is a table of the principal ' rural ' tribes of 'Iraq :— Tribe. Location. R emarks. 'Abdullah (Al) In the Najaf Qadah A settled tribe of Shi'ah agriculturists, by some regarded as a section of the Jalihah below. 'Afaj In the 'Afaj collection of villages on the Dagha- rah canal, and in that neighbourhood. The country inhabited by this tribal group is marshy. There are no horses and Mashhuf canoes are the chief means of locomo tion. 'Afaj is not really the name of a tribe, but it is used loosely to designate the whole body of tribes who inhabit 'Afaj. The principal among them are the 'Ajarij, Bahahithah, Hamzah, Makhadihah, Al Bu NaShi, Al Bu Rashid and Shaibah. These people are described as courageous, inde* pendent and trustworthy, but always engaged in feuds. 'Ajlb or 'Ajaib In the Qadhas of Najaf and Samawah. The 'Ajib are generally stated to be a subsection of the Jabar-al-Wawi section of the Zubaid; in religion they are Shi'ahs. In the Najaf Qadha they figure as nomads: in Samawah they are settled. 'Akaidat, or 'Aqai- dat. In the Qadha of Kadhi- main. i A settled tribe, Sunni by religion. There are about 1000 tents of this tribe near Hamah, in Syria, and 300- 400 in the Ghutah east of Damascus. ♦The separate articles on the tribes of 'Iraq, viz., the 'Atub, 'Idan, Khaza'il, Ban!

In the Qadha of Hindi- yah, partly in Mshorab- ash-Sharqi on the left bank of the Shatt-al- Hindiyah between Musaiyib and Tawai- rij. Some of the Bedouins of this tribe visit the parts of the Karbala and Najaf Qadhas which are nearest to the Sha- miyah desert. The Dagharah group of villages on the Dagha rah canal. Apparently in the Hindi- yah Qadha between the Mshorab canal from the Shatt-al-Hindiyah and the Abu Khasawi branch of the Dawihiyah canal. The 'Akarat number about 200 men; they are Shi'ahs and agriculturists. They are said to be a subsection of the Jabur-al-W awi section of the Zubaid and to be included in a subdivision of the tribe called the Al 'Isa. The 'Amiriyah are Shi'ahs, live in reed huts, cultivate, and keep cattle. They were originally connected with the Zubaid, but are now an independent tribe and are at present in alliance with the Bani Hasan below. See article 'Anizah. A general term covering a number of tribes of which the principal are these :—Hamad, Hilalat, Muja- wir, Nail (Al Bu), Sa'id (Al), Shiba- nah (Al), 'Umr (Al), and Zaiyad. To these should perhaps be added the Farahinah, Al Bu Husain, Al Bu Rishah and Sindan below. In their general characteristics the Aqra 1 resemble the tribes of the ? Afaj group above, whose neigh bours they are. They are all Shi 'ahs and have an evil reputation as robbers. These Bani Asad are only about 300 souls and have no horses; they are Shi'ahs and allied with the Bani Taraf. They are apparently identical with the Bani Sadd (see below). There is another tribe of the same name in the Qadha of Suq-ash-Shuyukh, especially in the neighbourhood of Hammar and Jazair upon the Euphrates.872 'IRlQ Kfi Tribe. 'Atij 'Atub ., 'Awalid Location.

The 'Atij number about 70 persons and are Shi'ahs by religion and engaged in agriculture. They are probably a subsection of the Jabut al-Wawi section of the Zubaid and not an independent tribe. See article 'Atub, The 'Awabidj who are Shi'ahs in- habiting tents and huts and en* gaged in agriculture and stock breeding, are estimated at 5,000 souls. They possess about 500 horses. The 'AwSbid are probably not an independent tribe but a section of the Bani Hasan below. In the Najaf Qadha the members of of this tribe are nomadic, visiting the district with their cattle in the winter only; in the Shamiyah Qadha, where their fixed settlements are, they are said to number 9,000 souls. Some settled 'Ayash are found along the Safhah creek or 'Aqiqah channel. All the 'Ayash are Shi 'ahs and the majority are engaged in cattle breeding, but the poorer among them cultivate. The tribe is independent but closely connected with the Bani Hasan below. The ancestors' of these Balush or Baluchis, who are Persian subjects and now number about 3,000 souls in 'Iraq, are said to have come from Baluchistan about 100 years ago at the invitation of Sahib-ar- Riyadh, a celebrated scholar of Karbala , to assist in defending that town against the Wahhabis. The Baraji' are Shi'ahs and can muster 400 men; they are friendly with the Al Bu Fatlah and at feud with the Bani Hasan. All are agriculturists. They are probably a section of the Jalihah below.'IKAQ 8?3 Tribe. Location. Barbari Budair (Ai) Bagharah Darraj (Al Bu) Da'i Dhafir At Najaf Town Remakks.

Some of the Bedouins of this tribe visit the right bank of the Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Nasiriyah. The Barbaris are not numerous in 'Iraq; they are believed to have entered the country as political refugees from Afghanistan. Bar baris are not now, perhaps, found in Afghanistan; but they were the original inhabitants of the Hazarajat and were practically annihilated by Jangiz Khan (or one of his successors) w r ho swamped them with military colonists (Hazaras). The Band-i-Amir Lakes in Afghanistan are still some times called the Band-i-Bar bar. The Al Budair are Shi'ahs, inhabit ing tents and huts, and engaged in agriculture and stock raising. They are said to number about 3,000 souls and to have 300 horses. Those in Shamiyah number about 300 men and are only cultivators: they are moreover so closely connected with the Bani Hasan as to be almost indistinguishable from them. This, like 'Afaj above, is not a genuine tribal name ; but it is used as a synonym for the 'Aqra mentioned above because they inhabit the Bagharah villages. By some authorities these Al Bu Barraj are treated not as an inde pendent tribe but as belonging to the Khasraj division of the Bani Lam. In general characteristics this tribe resembles the Jalihah. Politically they are dependent on the Al Kinanah, but they are sometimes said to be a subsection of the Jabur- al-Wawi section of the Zubaid. They are Shi'ahs by religion and agriculturists and cattle breeders by occupation. Their fighting men are said to number 400. See article Bhaf ir. C52(w)GSB 5i;874 'IRAQ Tribe.

Some of the Fadagah are Shi'aha and some are Sunnis; they are said to number 1,500 persons. A settled Shi'ah tribe on the Dagha- rah canal, engaged in cattle breed ing and agriculture. They are per haps one of the 'Aqra tribes men tioned above. This tribe is generally at feud with the Bani Hasan and on good terms with the Jalihah, Qarait and Tufail below. They are supposed to num ber some 10,000 souls; but their horses are only about 200. They are divided into about 25 sections, all agricultural and inhabiting either reed huts or mud houses. The Ghazalat are a Shi'ah tribe at enmity with the Dilaim and closely associated with the Khaza'il. In all they are said to muster about 2,000 men. The majority are Be^ douins and the rest agriculturists and cattle-breeders. Vulgarly known as the BaniHachaim, a large settled Shi'ah tribe engaged in stock raising and agriculture. They comprise many sections of which the following are the chief: 'Abas, 'Ata Ullah, 'Atawah, Burkat, Falahat, Fartus, Ghalidh, Al Bu Hachmah, Hamid, Hashish, 'Iqab, Jazburah, Muminin, Musha'alah, Sufran, and Taubah.'IRAQ 875 Tribe.

They cultivate rice and other cereals, own 500 horses and breed cattle and sheep, They live in tents and huts and are Shi'ahs. According to some the Hamaidat are a section of the Bani Hasan below. The Maulah, Mawash, Qaraishat and Bani Taraf tribes below and the Hamaidat above are closely asso ciated with the Bani Hasan and by some are even reckoned sections. Divisions of the Bani Hasan in Hor-ad-Dukhn are;— 'Abbas, Al Bu 'Adhaib, A1 Bu 'Aridhi, Al Bu Hadari, Hawatim, and Majatim. Other divisions of the tribe elsewhere are :— Bani 'Amr, Al DahJm, Al Bu Hadadi^ Al Jamil, Al Jarrah, Bani Salamah and Sarawan, of whom the Bani Salamah at least are Bedouins. The 'Awabid already described above are probably a section of the Bani Hasan; and similarly the 'Ayash and Al Budair, though independent tribes, are very closely connected with the Bani Hasan. The Bani Hasan are usually on bad terms with their neighbours the Baraji' • and the Al Bu Fatlah above and the Karakishah below are their friends. The Bani Hasan are roughly estimated at 10,000 souls, but they have only about 200 horses. About of the tribe sometimes move with their cattle in search of pasture. • The Shaikh Hasan are probably not a separate tribe. Some describe them as a section of the Ka'ab and others would merge them in the Muhaisin. They are Shi'ahs. 5u2 mmm BP876 'IRAQ dC. Tribe. Location. R emarks. Hashim (Bani) Hassan (Al Bu) .

One account, which is not confirmed, says that they are identified with the section of the Quraish of which the prophet Muhammad oame and are honoured as Saiyids. It has also been stated that they are found in many places throughout Turkish 'Iraq, but in this perhaps there is some confusion with the Bani Hakim or Hachaim above. The Al Bu Hassan are a large settled Shi'ah tribe comprising, among others, these sections:—'Abbas, Al Bu Ainain, Jalabitah, Khamis and Suhur. These may perhaps be regarded as belonging to the Aqra 1 group above. They live in tents and keep sheep. They have no horses, but they have many canoes and are fairly well armed. They are a settled tribe. Some say that the Bani Sadd on the Shatt^al- Hindiyah are Bani Husain, The Al Ibrahim are Shi'ahs and are supposed to number about 4,000 souls. They live in tents and huts and cultivate rice and pulse and breed cattle. They have about 300 horses. They may be a section of the Al Shibil below. See article 'Idan. It seems preferable to class the Jabur as a double section of the Zubaid the article on which tribe may be consulted. But some authorities regard them as a distinct tribe, divid ed into two sections which are now unconnected with one another; viz., the Jabur*al-Wawi of the Euph rates valley, who are all Shi'ahs, and the Jabur of the Tigris side, who are Sunnis.m- j ie1q 877 ^untafik, onfirmed, fied with of which wne and found in 'fh 'Iraq, is some tkim or 3 settled pothers, A1 Bu is and ded as above, i sheep. )y have armed, me say battel' id are 4,000 1 huts le ii Jabut divid- now )ther; Euph- ii'ahs, Tribe.

Zumailat With the Mas'ud A small tribe dependent on the Mas'ud, of whom some would classify them as a section. They are Shi'ahs, and though settled are much addicted to robbery. Their men are only about 50 in number. The following general remarks upon the customs of the rural Arab population relate in the first instance to the tribes of the Euphrates and Shatt-al-Hindiyah country in the neighbourhood of Karbala Town, but in some degree they are true of all. Two stringent articles of the tribal code are those relating to protection and assistance : under the first a person on whose protection another expressly throws himself must re ceive him into his house and refuse to surrender him even at the cost of his own life; under the second a guest who, after declining proffered food and coffee, is addressed with the phrase ' Eat, thy demand shall be satisfied ' is entitled to the utmost assist ance of his entertainer in the design which he may thereupon unfold. An important feature of the tribal system is the payment of Dlyah or blood-money for murders, a matter which has so far been left in the hands of the Shaikhs. The ordinary price of a man's life ranges from 100 to 1,000 Bashliks, say £4 to £40 (English); but among the Muntafik it is £37, among the Bani Malik £60, and among the Khaza'il is said to rise to as much as 1,000 Majid's or about £170. The value of a woman is generally the same as that of a man, but sometimes it is half ; the Diyah of a Saiyid is double that of an ordinary person. If the victim and the murderer belong to different tribes the relations of the victim receive h the blood-money, the Shaikhs of his tribe take J, and the remaining ^ is divided among his fellow tribesmen at large. Money compensation may be declined, and the heir of a murdered man may demand instead two unmarried girls of his own selction from the murderer's tribe ; on their being made over to him the claim to pecuniary compensation is transfered from him to the girls' next-of-kin. For a woman received in marriage a sum of 100 to 1,000 Bashliks, called Mihr, is paid to her father or nekt-of-kin ; the bride is carried in procession to the house of the bridegroom with jumping, singing, dancing and firing of guns,—a display known as Hosah ; on the next day one of the relatives of the bridegroom spreads a cloth on the ground and exclaims ' Sh5bash ', whereupon the guests come forward with their wedding presents. Strange to say the same performance of Hosah attends the conveyance of a corpse to burial; the Fatihah is then read and mourning continues for from three to five days: the mourners are treated as guests, but they bring with them money or other presents. A pilgrim returned from Makkah holds a reception for three days ; his visitors also are his guests, and they too offer gifts. The clothing of the ordinary countryman consists of a cotton shirt or tunic known as Thob, a woollen cloak called 'Aba or Bishit, a Kafiyah or kerchief, and an 'Aqal or head band. Milk (Halib), curds (Libn), bread ('Aish) and dates are the chief articles of diet; the bread is generally of barley kneadei with milk, wheat bread being reserved for ex ceptional occasions and given to guests. The people inhabit for the most part black tents of hair-cloth, styled Buyut-ash-Sha'ar (houses of hair), or huts of grass, thorns, reeds or date-matting, called Kukh. The agriculture of most tribes is shifting and de sultory ; their cultivation includes wheat, barley, maize, sesame, mash, pulse, linseed, vegetables, rice and dates, varying according to the character of the soil and the means of irrigation. Their domestic animals are the camel, buffaloe, horse, cow, sheep and goat.888 the kind of livestock kept by a particular tribe depending on the nature of its lands; the pastoral portions of most tribes generally wander in the desert in spring, accompanied by their flocks and herds. At times, in certain localities, a considerable number of Arabs earn a livelihood by digging liquorice root for exportation to America; some of these belong to the Fallahln or cultivating tribes, and certain of the semi-settled and Bedouin tribes also allow their women to earn money by this occupation. The more nomadic tribes are incorrigibly lazy and averse to every sort of manual labour. Arms. —The armament of several of the tribes to which special articles have been devoted is noticed in those articles. To speak generally, the tribes nearest to the Persian Gulf are the most heavily armed •with modern rifles ; this is due to the facilities which existed for secret importation into the Shatt-al-'Arab. Up to the time of the outbreak of the great war there wore three main sources of supply. Large quantities of arms and ammunition, often manifested as materials for the Baghdad railway, were smuggled into Basrah by the Germans. There was also a considerable leakage from the rifles and cartridges pur chased by certain Shaikhs with the permission of the Government of India. Almost the whole of the above passed into the hands of the tribesmen. The tribes in the Basrah Wilayat have now as many rifles as they can afford to purchase ; but the Bani Rabi'ah about Kut-al- Amarah have fewer, and the Zubaid and Shammar T5qah, who lie above them, are still comparatively u .provided with arms of precision. The favourite pattern of breech-loader in 'Iraq is the Martini, but there are also a great many Mausers. Where breech-loaders are deficient the favourite substitute is a double-barrelled muzzle-loading gun, and this is the weapon most in evidence at the present day between Baghdad and Karbala and in the neighbourhood of Karbala and Hillah. Swords arc still worn by some tribes ; and the Bedouin lance, 12 feet in length with a broad and formidable blade, is still common in the desert and may be seen even upon the banks of the rivers. Curved daggers about a foot in length, double-edged and very sharp at the point, are frequently carried, particularly by Persians. The weapon of the herd-boy and of the very poor is a kind of knobkerry, consisting of a stick about 2 feet long on one end of which is fixed a hard and heavy lump of bitumen. The ordinary tribes measure their strength in rifles and men, distinguishing the latter as mounted or unmounted ; their more aquatic brethren keep account chiefly of rifles and of boats or canoes. Religion. —The country population is almost universally Shi'ah except in the out lying north-western districts of the Sanjaq of Baghdad, and Shi 'ism may accordingly be styled the religion of 'Iraq. The principal exceptions to the rule in our list of tribes are the 'Anizah, Dhafir, and Shammar who can hardly be said to belong to the tract; the Sa'idun or ruling section of the Muntafik ; two sections (in part only) of the Zubaid, and a majority of the.Janabiyin : these and a few other petty clans are Sunnis. The case of town populations is somewhat different, but not sufficiently so to reverse the broad statement that 'Iraq is a Shi'ah country. In the Baghdad Wilayat only about J of the total population appears to be Sunni, and the Sunnis are confined almost entirely to the Sanjaq of Baghdad, a large number of them belonging to Baghdad City itself. In the Basrah Wilayat the proportion of Sunnis is only about T \ , and only a very few are found outside the towns of Basrah and Zubair. The Muhammadans of ? Iraq generally are ignorant and uninformed in their own religion, but not fanatical; neither statement, however, applies to the inhabitants of the religious centres of Karbala, Najaf, and Kadhimain. Superstitions are universal especially regarding the evil eye, charms against which are worn even by adulta and are placed upon children and young or pet animals, besides being affixed to houses, sailing-boats and even Quffahs or coracles. The principal religions of 'Iraq, other than the Muhammadan, are the Jewish and the Christian. Jews are numerous, but Christianity numbers only a few thousand adherents distributed among the following sects, whom we mention in their probable order of numerical importance,— Gregorian Armenian Church, Chaldsean Catholic Church, Syrian Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Church, Catholic Armenian Church, various Protestant Churches, Greek Church, % N'lElQ Language. —The prevailing language of 'Iraq is Arabic of a not very pure type. The official classes however speak and write Turkish, and the superior officers sent from European Turkey often do not understand Arabic. Persian is largely spoken in the towns, especially at Karbala, Najaf and Kadhimain, where it is generally understood, Kurdish is spoken by the Kurds, Hebrew by the Jews, and a language of their own—• perhaps Syriac—by the Sabians. The most diffused European language at Baghdad is French, and after it English ; the use of English, however, is, on the increase &lt;at Baghdad, and at Basrah English has already distanced all European competitors. AgricuUurK —Cultivation, as already remarked, is restricted to a comparatively small fraction of the total area of 'Iraq: with a proper system of canal irrigation it might be immensely extended. The backward 'Condition of agriculture is attributable chiefly to want of irrigation in some parts and to want of drainage in others, but also in a •certain degree to scarcity of labour, and on the verge of the desert to tho insecurity pro duced by Bedouin raids. It has been estimated that at present not more than one- tenth of the Baghdad Wilayat is cutivated, and even that not continuously nor the Whole of it in the same year; and some authorities would even place the proportion of productive lands throughout 'Iraq as low as 3 per cent, of the whole. There are two harvests in 'Iraq, the spring or Shitwi and the autumn or Saifi. The principal spring crops are wheat, barley, beans, and Hurtuman. Wheat and barley are sown on plains that have a moderate supply of water, either before or after Jawairid, the name given by the Arab cultivator to the first cold days of winter, when the trees lose their last leaves,the earlier sowings, called Hirfi, are made in September and October, the latter, called Athli, between November and the end of January, The wheat and barley harvest begins in April, the grain after being dried in stacks in the sun is threshed by being trodden with buffaloes or cows, except near the towns where a threshing-machine Jar jar of native (Musal) manufacture is sometimes used. In an average year the return for seed sown is &lt;about 8 or 10-fold ; and the ^Alwas or grain-stores which are a feature of many country towns along with the satistics of the export trade attest a frequent surplus of cereals in some districts. The best wheat and barley lands probably are (or till recently were| those about Hillahon both sides of the Euphrates, the surplus produce of which is sent down the Euphrates in native boats to Basrah for local consumption or shipment. The neighbourhood of ''Amarah Town also is becoming known for its wheat and bariey. Beans are planted at the end of September and are harvested in the beginning ol April, but green beans appear in the market about the middle of February. Beans are of various kinds, including the broad, French and haricot varieties and large quantities of them, when dried, are exported to Indian ports and to Jiddah on the Red Sea. Hurtuman, described as a sort of oats, is sown in January and reaped about the end of May. The autumn crops are rice, called Timn or Shilib, maize or Idhrah, sesame, a millet known as Dukhn, Mash {a lentil), Lubiyah (a kidney pea), and, of course, dates : some ootton also is grown, but chiefly outside the limits with which we have to deal. Rice is the chief item of the autumn harvest and in the Baghdad market is of 4 principal kinds: the best are Nakkazah and 'Ambarbu the second of these being a peculiarly scented variety esteemed by Indians and Persians ; the third is Shimbah, which is the common est kind and the fourth is Huwaizawi, a cheap, reddish'rice consumed by the poorer classes. Bice straw, called Buh, is utilised as fodder for cattle. The principal rice grounds are on the Shatt-al-Hindiyah between Tawairij and Kufah, especially about Hor-ad-Dukhn on the Dagharah canal; in the Qadhas of Shamiyah and Samawah; and in the part of the country adjoining ''Amarah Town. Idhrah is sown in March and reaped in August or September. Sesame is grown on plains which are inundated by the rivers in their rise and dry up again in the course of the summer, and it is seen also along the banks of creeks from the Shatt-al-'Arab in the Basrah Qadha; most of it is pressed for oil, which is used in cooking and for lighting purposes, but some is roasted and eaten, with bread, and some is used in the manufacture of sweetmeats orHalawah. Dukhn, sown at the end of March and reaped in August or September, is cultivated on a large scale upon the Tigris and even more upon the Euphrates: some is used locally as food for cattle and poultry or is mixed with wheat to make bread : the remainder is exported by way of Basrah. Mash is of two kinds, green and black, both of which are sown in the end of June ; the green ripens at the middle or end of September, the black in the beginning i)f November. Mash is cultivated on damp, sandy plains and does not C62(w)GSB890 require watering ; the native mix it with rice to make soup, and a large quantity is ex* ported to India. Lubiyah is sown in June and harvested in October ; it grows on river banks and on plains inundated by the rise of the rivers ; it begins to be sold green as a vegetable in June or July ; when dry it is assorted into red and white, the red kind being the cheaper. Lubiyah is locally consumed, but some is exported to India. The lentil proper or 'Adas of 'Iraq is inferior. Dates are of many sorts, and the immense plantations which fringe the banks of the Shatt-al'Arab below and above Basrah Town are probably the finest in the world. There is also a noble stretch of date groves some 30 miles in length upon both sides of the (old) bed of the Euphrates above and below Hillah Town, but these are declining in conse quence of the diversion of the Euphrates into the Shatt-al'Hindiyah. Another large date-growing tract is at Shifathah to the west of Karbala, Good date plantations exist also around Baghdad City, Karbala Town and Kufah and at other places. The subject of date culture and the date trade is more fully dealt with elsewhere in a special Appendix of the Gazetteer. Common fruits are water-melons, marsh-melons pomegra nates, oranges (in the Baghdad Wilayat), sweet and sour limes, apricots, quinces and grapes ; almonds, figs, olives, citrons, apples, nectarines and peaches grow—the citrons at Hillah and the peaches at Bghailah among other places—but the last three are of poor quality ; there are also mulberries at Karbala and upon the course of the Diyalah. Among the vegetables of 'Iraq are onions, radishes, beetroot, garlic, cucumbers, cabbage, cauliflower, turnips, carrots, tomatoes, artichokes, ladies' fingers, brinjals, lettuce, cress, pumpkins of three kinds and potatoes ; but garlic, though used in great quantities, is imported to a larger extent than it is grown, mostly from Persia, while potatoes are of recent introduction and have not yet come into general use except among the well-to-do. Tobacco, known as Dukhan or Tutun, which is a state monopoly, is grown in certain localities only, principally about Karbala and Najaf, but also to the north-east of Baghdad City in the Diyalah valley. In the Baghdad Wilayat cultivated lands are classified according to the means of irrigation : thus we have,'though rarely, lands watered only by rainfall and called Daim ; lands watered by lifts with ' pulleys ' and therefore called Bakrah or, if the means of irrigation is a bucket, Saqi; finally we have lands irrigated from canals and known as Saih. Marshes and drying pools, when cultivated, are styled Kibis (pronounced Chibis); and land moistened by little runnels, such as are used in rice fields, is known as Chaltlq. Canals are numerous but they are seldom in good working order. A number of them are specified by name in the articles on the rivers Euphrates, Tigris, and Shatt-al- Hindiyah ; the most important, to which separate articles are devoted, are the Dagharah, Husaimyah, and Jahalah. Water-lifts are generally used for date gardens, and some arable land also along the banks of the two great rivers is irrigated by their means, lifts are of two kinds, the Karad (pronounced Charad) and the Na'ur. In the Karad the water is hoisted in a camel-skin bucket, termed Dalu, by means of a rope which passes over a pulley ; while in the Na'ur it is raised by a series of buckets slung from a revolving wheel; the Na'ur is of comparatively recent introduction and is cheaper in working than the Karad but not so effectual: both kinds of apparatus are actuated by animal power, and both have their counterparts in India. In the neighbourhood of Baghdad •City centrifugal pumps worked by oil engines have been introduced and promise to become popular. The easiest and most natural irrigation of all is in the Shatt-al-'Arab region where the sea-tides raise the fresh water of the river, twice in the 24 hours, almost to the level of the cultivated land. Livestock. —Domestic animals are cattle everywhere; buffaloes in the marshy tracts, which are of an excellent class but are said to suffer from the cold in winter and from the attacks of insects in summer; fat-tailed sheep yielding mutton almost equal to that of Europe; donkeys of average, and mules of good quality; camels, a proportion of which are very light in colour; and horses, which have a high reputation but are not equal to those of Najd or Syria. Some good horses, however, are reared in the Hillah and DI wanly ah Qadhas : the best cattle are those of the tract about 'Amarah Town. The Bani Lam tribe are celebrated for their horses, camels and sheep, and the A1 Bu Muham mad for their buffaloes. Tame birds are pigeons., fowls, turkeys^ ducks, and geese; the turkeys and fowls are exceptionally fine,'IRAQ 891 green as Trade generally. —During the last 20 years a substantial, and on the whole steady, increase has been observable in the volume of trade in 'Iraq and it still, apparently, continues. It is attributed to the spread of what has been styled ' comparative civil isation ' in the country itself ; and to a larger demand in Persia for the ' comparative luxuries' which that country obtains through'Iraq, Bombay is felt, throughout 'Iraq, to be the nearest great centre of commerce and civilisation ; and since the recent institution of a rapid steamer service to India it is a common though not strictly accurate remark among natives, that Bombay and Bagh dad are equally distant from Basrah, Two facts in regard to the trade of 'Iraq should be clearly realised at the outset: first that it consists to a large extent merely of a transit trade between the Persian Gulf and Western Persia, secondly that it has only one real centre, namely, Baghdad. The position of unique importance occupied by Baghdad as a point of divergence and convergence in transit, in foreign, and even to some extent in internal, trade is indeed remarkable ; no less so is its mercantile predominance over Basrah, which, but for a local trade in dates and grain, would be little more than the seaport of Baghdad, The hides of 'Amarah often ascend the Tigris to be pressed at Baghdad for shipment to Europe, and the retail traders of Basrah itself obtain quantities of European goods, especially piece-goods, from the wholesale merchants of Baghdad. On the Tigris from 'Amarah town upwards, and in the Euphrates valley above Kufah and its neighbourhood, most commercial dealings are with Baghdad. Even the remaind er of 'Iraq, though nearer to Basrah, is partially served from Baghdad through Basrah and other places. The commercial influence of Baghdad balances at Musal with that of Aleppo ; and the whole of Kurdistan and the parts of Western Persia about Kirmanshah and Hamadan are dependent on Baghdad for their supply of foreign goods. As Basrah is the limit of ocean-borne traffic, so Baghdad marks the point where carriage by river, against the stream, ceases to be profitable ; and, except for rafts which descend the Tigris from Musal to Baghdad, all commerce to the east, north, and west of the capital is carried on by mule or camal caravan. From a political point of view imports by sea and, in a lesser degree, exports by sea are the most important features of the trade of 'Iraq ; but, in order to understand the basis on which ocean-borne imports and exports rest, we must first examine the questions of internal trade, local manufactures and imports by land. Internal traiif.—Tha functions of Baghdad are, in relation to internal trade, compara tively restricted ; but it is the principal centre for the distribution of cotton piece-goods in the whole country. Moreover, it sends to Musal sugar, colfee, spices, twists, window- glass and metals,—but not piece-goods, which the people of Musal procure mostly through Syria,—and receives in return the best of the 'Awwasi or 'Awaisi wool* and the whole of the mohair and gall-nuts which constitute important items of the general export trade, besides oak and walnut wood, partly for exportation, and beams and rafters of poplar for local use. Ba'qubah is dependent on Baghdad for manufactured articles, and sends much fruit and firewood to Baghdad by way of the Diyalah river. The chief centres of internal trade in the west are Karbala, which imports piece-goods, sugar, kerosine, Indian spices, tea, Persian medicines and Persian fruit, and exports dates, consecrated objects, skins, wool and inferior tobacco ; Musaiyib, which takes piece-goods and sends away wheat and barley; Tawairij, which buys piece-goods and sells wheat, barley and dates ; Hillah, which imports piece-goods, sugar and coffee or; a large scale and exports wheat, barley, ghi, dates, sheep-skins and goat-skins on a still larger; finally Najaf, which receives large quantities of piece-goods, sugar, tea and Indian spices and disposes of lambskins and 'Abas. All of these receive their pieco-goods from Baghdad, and the general trade of Musaiyib and Karbala seems to be mostly with Baghdad ; but Hillah and probably Najaf receive most of th^ir goods (other than piece-goods) by way of the Euphrates via Kufah, and Hillah exports its dates direct to Basrah. It is from these western districts that the capital draws a large part of its supplies of wheat and rice. On the Tigris below Baghdad, the towns of Kut-al-Amarah and 'Ali-al-Gharbi are the principal seats of the trade with Southern Kurdistan ; hereabouts many Kurds are settled, and Kurds from the Persian frontier come in to satisfy their wants, bringing *'Awwasi wool is obtained from a crossbreed between the Arab or plain-reared sheep and the Kurdish or his reared sheep, Arab wool is fine and curly, Kurdish is coarse and straight; while 'Awwasi, which is considered to form a class by itself, is intermediate between the two. 5 y 2m nniQ with them ghi, skins, wool, galls, gum, aniseed, pistachios, walnuts and other nUf^ iri all of which there is a considerable trade. Kut-al-Amarah deals chiefly with the Kurdish towns of Badrah and Jassan, which lie within the Turkish frontier but at a distance from the Tigris; at • Ali-al-Gharbi wheat and barley from the surrounding plains are accumulated. 'Amarah Town is to some extent a centre of the Kurdish trade, but it is also a market for the produce of the surrounding Bani Lam and A1 Bu Muhammad tribes ; consequently we find it to be a considerable emporium of ghi, hides, wool, rice and, to some extent, of barley and wheat. Qal'at Salih, further down the Tigris, is a centre of the rice trade; and dates, wheat, barley, rice. Straw, date-mats and reed- mats can all be procured at Qurnah, though the trade of that place is not so large as might from its position have been expected. Camels for export are mostly collected at Samawah, Dlwamyab and Najaf, sheep; cattle and buffaloes in the neighbourhood of 'Amarah. The Shi'ah pilgrimages to Karbala, Najaf, Kadhimain and Samarrab are an impor tant factor in the internal trade of 'Iraq ; they are the cause, for example, of an immense- demand for forage at Kadhimain, where most of the pilgrims leave their riding-animals for several days during their absence at Karbala and Najaf, and of the existence at the same town of a good supply of carpets brought by the pilgrims from Persia. The trade in sacred objects and souvenirs, such as Turbands (praying-tablets made of the earth of the holy places) and Winding sheets stamped with verses from the Quran, which is of some value at Karbala and Najaf, likewise depends upon the custom of pilgrims. There are no wholesale carriers or forwarding; agents in the country, and transport must be specially engaged whenever merchandise is to be moved. Additional light will be cast upon internal trade by the remarks on local manufactures which follow- Manufactures. —Baghdad City is the chief seat of industries^ but these are not me chanical ; in fact, apart from a private ice-factory, and two out of several wool-presses, the town cannot boast of much machinery driven by steam. At or near Basrah Town there are two British wool-presses and one American liquorice-press, also a soda-water factory owned by an Indian and a flour mill and an ice-machine belonging to a Jew. An important element in some of the most characteristic manufactures of Baghdad is a kind of silken thread, called Sha'ri ; the true Sha'ri is said to be a vegetable product, but Assam or ' Moga ' silk, imported from Calcutta, is also used and is described as Sha'ri. At Baghdad silk thread is woven into a stuff called Aghabani, from which light summer clothing, especially 'Abas, is manufactured. Silk is also used to embroider turbans, girdles, tablecloths, curtains and counterpanes in a special style; the art is almost entirely confined to Jewesses and a few female Christians. Long pieces em broidered with silk are called Kashldah and are used as headdresses, square pieces are known as Charqand : many of the embroidered turbans are exported to Northern Africa. Striped cotton piece-goods are manufactured at Baghdad, in imitation of those of Damascus, and are made into Zabuns or Antaris, that is, into the long body-garments worn by men, and into long waistcoats or jackets called Duglahs: other materials locally woven and applied to the same use are Alajah* a cotton fabric, and Qutni, a mixture of silk and wool. ^ Women's veils, called Yashmaq, women's shawls or sheets, called Charshafs and Izars are made at Baghdad; also ladies' ornamental belts and kerchiefs of various kinds in silk, cotton and wool; the handkerchiefs for ladies are embroidered with silk, and the kerchiefs for Arabs, called Kafiyahs and generally fringed or tasselled, are dearer but more durable than those of Manchester make. Coarse cotton cloth for the Wear of the poorer classes is made at Baghdad, also canvas for tents; but tents of Indian or Persian materials are preferred by the well-to-do, who use them for camping out in spring and autumn. There is some silk-weaving at ICadhimain, and the silk-embroidered handkerchiefs of that town have a sale in Algeria and Tunis. Haramat or woollen rugs and Zull or coarse carpets are manufactured at Kut-al-Amarah, and rough Kurdish carpets, both cheap and durable, at 'Amarah Town; these close the list of textiles. 'Abas or Arab cloaks are manufactured at Baghdad City, at the towns of Kadhimain; Karbala, Najaf, 'Amarah, Saq-ash-Shuyiikh and at the village of Qurnah ; those Of Baghdad are sometimes of silk, but generally of wool, with gold or silk embroidery ; those of Najaf are frequently of silk embroidered with gold; those of 1 Amarah are in'IKlQ 893 • great demand at Baghdad and in the neighbourhood ; those of Qurnah, called kaclii- yah or Batiyah, are famous for their lightness and can, it is said, be passed through a finger-ring. Jewellers are found in all the principal towns, and the Sabian gold and silver-smiths of Suq-ash-Shuyukh, Shatrat-al-Muntafik and 'Amarah Towns are among the best; the jewellers of 'Amarah have an art, possibly peculiar to themselves, of inalying silver with antimony. Combs and small objects of ivory, wood and tortoise-shell are made at Kadhimain, chiefly by Persians; and filigree work in the precious metals and elaborate engraving on mother-of-pearl are executed at Karbala. More solid industries are those of tanning and working leather, which have their principal seat in Baghdad City and its suburbs. The tanneries are chiefly at Mu'adhdham, where a large number of hands are employed in 40 establishments and 5,000 sheepskins and goatskins are turned out every week. At Kadhimain are similar tanneries on a smaller scale. The leather, though only rough-tanned, finds a ready sale in Europe. From local leather are made, at Baghdad and in Mu'adhdham, the Yamanls or red and yellow shoes worn by Arabs and old fashioned Baghdadis of other classes; also the slippers called Papush or Babuj and a kind of boot known as Masht, the latter being a kind of yellow top-boot which is worn by old Muhammadan females. The Baghdad coppersmiths are experts in their craft and make boilers, kettles, coffee pots and large copper dishes. House-building is understood in many places and the Juss or gypsum-mortar commonly used is prepared in quantities at Mahmudlyah between Baghdad and Musaiyib and at Zubair near Basrah. Encaustic or Kashi tiles are made by Persians, mostly at Karbala, but also at Kadhimain and Baghdad. At Kadhimain are numerous good Persian painters and decorators. The clay earthernware of Baghdad, very light-coloured and porous, is exported to Basrah and other nearer places; the commonest articles are water-coolers and filters called Hubbs often of large size, and Jarrahs or goblets. Boats and canoes are built at Qal'at Salih, Shatrat-al-Muntafik, Suq-ash-Shuyukh and other places. Much of the' Araq or native spirit consumed in the Bahgdad and Basrah districts is distilled at Qarah on the Tigris three miles from Baghdad; the basis of the spirit is derived from Zahdi dates; aniseed, orange-peel, mastic and cardamoms are other ingredients • there is also some distillation at Hillah, but the produce is said to be inferior. Import trade hy land. —The import trade by land is chiefly on the Persian side, whence gums, opium and carpets are brought in some quantity, also fruit including apples and pears. Wheat also is obtained from Persia for local consumption in years of scarcity, but not generally, except at Basrah, for exportation abroad. The most valuable of the imported gums is gum tragacanth, which is handled in flake, not in powder, and is used for the best varnishes; there is no gum Arabic, but a considerable trade is done in anoher gum which exudes from the bitter-almond tree and was believed, until a few years ago, to be insoluble. Samagh is the generic name in Arabic of all tree-gums. A number of the articles, already enumerated in a previous paragraph, which reach Baghdad from Musal are actually of Persian origin. Some imports which are received partly by land and partly by sea are mentioned in the paragraph below on imports by sea. External trade generally. —With the agricultural resources, local manufactures and overland imports of the country before us, we are now in a position to approach the subject of sea-borne imports and of all kinds of exports ; and, in view of the smallness of the cultivated area and of the trivial character of the manufactured articles, we shall not be surprised to find that the foreign trade of 'Iraq is of moderate dimensions and that the land-borne traffic upon the Persian side is one of its most important items in other words, that the trade of the country is largely a transit trade. Imports and exports at the port of Basrah are the measure of the foreign trade, goods for the interior being all included in the shipping returns of that place ; consular statistics, however, in 'Iraq have to be compiled without access to reliable returns, and it is some times impossible to reconcile the figures for Basrah with those for Baghdad which they are supposed to include. Import trade hy sea. —The trade in cottons is chiefly in the hands of the Jews, some of whom have agents, generally near relations, in London or Manchester: at Baghdad cottons probably amount to as much a-? three-fourths of the total imports in value. The trade in white and grey shirtings is practically a Jewish monopoly, but about894 one-fourth of the prints are imported by British firms. Next in order of value after cotton goods is sugar, both loaf and crushed; some is from Belgium, Austria and Egypt, but the great bulk of it is from France which also supplies (but in small quantities) leather for the manufacture of European boots and shoes, silk goods, satins, gold brocade, broadcloth, brandy and Bordeaux wine. The Oriental Christian merchants of Baghdad mostly trade with France, as the Jews do with England; but there is not in this any basis of political sentiment. Wood and timber, coffee, gunnies, metals, yarn and twist, spices, kerosene and tobacco are the principal remaining imports. The import ed wood is mostly for date-boxes and comes from Austria; but bastard teak, locally called Jawi is imported by an Indian firm at Basrah from Calicut and Singapore : nearly all building timber, planks and charcoal are from Indian 'ports, the charcoal being from Karachi, but part of the building timber is from Russia, Sweden and Norway. Coffee is principally Brazilian ; but India supplies the gunnies, the cotton yarn and twist and the spices. Indigo also is brought in considerable, and tea in increasing, quantities from British India : about | of the tea is now from India. Iron, the metal most imported, is of British origin. Kerosene is from Russia, but only part of it is received through a Russian medium; the Indian firm already mentioned imports some kerosene direct from Batoum. America, whose trade with 'Iraq is every year greater, sends cheap blankets, bed-sheets and watches, and nearly all the stockings now sold in the Baghdad bazaar are of American manufacture, but the quantity of these last is small. Germany and Austria supply cheap fancy articles, fezes, crockery, low-priced clothes, sometimes second-hand, penknive, articles of German silver, sewing machines and all sorts of haberdashery: the best candles are from Holland, and the best window glass is from Belgium. There are, in addition to the sea-imports just enumerated and to the land-imports from Persia already specified, some imports, partly by sea and partly by land, from other provinces of the Ottoman empire; goods from Constantinople, however, are now received chiefly by sea, and those from Aleppo largely so via Alexandretta. Such imports are blankets, flannels, fezes, bath-towels, ladies shoes, slippers, knives and fancy articles from Constantinople, and native soap, rope, pistachios, silk and gold-thread from Aleppo and Damascus ; Alleppo to a greater extent than Baghdad supplies the cotton piece-goods of Musal. Silk for embroidery is from Syria and Northern Persia, except the ' Moga ' silk from the East which is so largely used in Baghdad embroideries. It is estimated by experts that no less than three-fourths of the foreign goods import ed into Baghdad are re-exported to Persia. Export trade by sea.—Dates are the most valuable export by sea, and in 1905 those despatched by sea from Basrah were estimated to be worth £345,184; most are grown in the Basrah neighbourhood and sent to England and America, but some Zahdi and Kursi dates from the plantations about Baghdad are consignei, packed in skins, to Egypt, the Levant and the Black Sea ports. Wheat and barley taken together generally hold the second place, barley, much of which is from the Shatt-al-Gharaf and Amarah districts, greatly predominating over wheat in spite of the fact that wheat is the only grain which leaves Baghdad for abroad. Wool and mohair, Persian opium, seeds (including Idhrah, Dukhn, Mash, sesame, linseed and hemp), Kurdistan gall-nuts, skins and hides, succeed grain and follow one other in order of importance ; next are horses, and Persian carpets, the last mostly through Baghdad; then gum, then liquorice-root. Other exports are intestines, to be utilised as sausage-skins, and dogs dung which goes to Austria for use in the tanning of fine leather. There is a small trade with Bombay in Persian raisins, and Baghdad oranges and pomegranates have been exported ex perimentally to the same place. Ghi from 'Ahmarah and other places reaches Bombay, the Red Sea and even the ports of the Levant. Maize, colocynth and almond-kernels, the last for the manufacture of prussic acid, are also exported to a limited extent. The destination of the wool is London, Marseilles, America, Germany or Austria; of the gall-nuts London, Bombay or Persia ; of the gums London, Marseilles and some times New York and Austria ; of the wheat the Red Sea coast and London ; of the opium Hongkong, except a little which goes to Singapore and Europe; of the skins and hides Constantinople, France and the United Kingdom. Some walnut wood is sent to Marseilles, and 85 per cent, of the liquorice-root is taken by America, where the liquorice-paste with which American tobacco is sweetened is manufactured from it. The liquorice business in 'Iraq is now managed by an agency of the American Tobacco Trust.'IRAQ 895 The root is collected in the winter months when it contains most juice and, after being weighed and cured at the receiving stations, is forwarded to Basrah where it is baled by hydraulic power. The value at Basrah at the time of export is about £6 a ton and the average quantity of the root exported is at present about 4,000 tons per annum. The trade in horses to India is important though not very large ; the number shipped from Basrah in 1905 was 2,262. Persian carpets and hides and dates find a market at Constantinople; and Persian carpets, ' Moga ' silk articles, ladies' Izars, dates and spices in Syria; the spices are largely Indian. Most of the Persian carpets, however, go to America and London, and high prices are realised in those markets for old ones ; new carpets are not appreciated as they frequently owe their colours to aniline dyes. The total value of the exports by sea is about £1,300,000 annually, or the same as the value of the sea-borne imports. Export trade hy land. —The wares for places on the Mediterranean are sent partly by sea and partly by caravan, but one of the principal exports,—that of camels, buffaloes, cattle and sheep,—takes place entirely overland; the camels are collected at Samawah and Najaf, and the other animals are assembled mostly in the neighbourhood of 'Amarah Town whence they are marched in huge 'droves up the Tigris to Musal and from there across country to Aleppo and Alexandria, the agents of the purchasers accompanying them to settle the difficulties of the road. The ultimate destination of the camels and part of the cattle is Egypt; the remainder of the cattle and the sheep are disposed of in Syria. The trade of ? Iraq with Najd is not what it once was, owing to the competition of the Kuwait and Hasa routes, by which Central Arabia now receives a large proportion of the manufactured goods that it consumes; but of late years the disturbances in Najd and Jabal Shammar and the insecurity of the more southern roads have brought about a certain revival by which Samawah and other towns on the lower Euphrates have benefit ed ; and occasional visits of the Hadrah, also called Risalah, a commercial and purchas ing mission from Jabal Shammar to Najaf, have not ceased. At some places on the western frontier, such as Shifathah, there is a periodical Bedouin fair or market known as Musabalah. Formerly there was a much frequented route from Basrah to Najd on which the first stage was Zubair Town. The exports to Najd are few and simple, consist ing chiefly of cotton-prints for clothing, cotton and silk handkerchiefs for head-cover ings, sugar, coffee, enamelled ironware, and in some years grain, the last from Karbala and Najaf. The outward trade to Persia is, as already pointed out, simply a later phase—and an important one—of the inward trade to Baghdad. Shipping and river traffic. —Cotton' and sugar upwards, and wool, carpets, skins, mohair, gum, opium and gall-nuts downwards are chiefly conveyed by steamer; but other commodities, such as grain and .liquorice, which are either more bulky or have to be picked up at many points, travel by native boat. Trade customs, credit, and commercial system. —A short statement of mercantile customs and of the manner in which trade generally is conducted will not be out of place here ; information regarding import, transit and export duties will be found under the head of taxation below. At Baghdad, the trade of which is typical of the trade of the country, all weighments, except of consignments between principal and agent or vice versa, are made by public weighmen. These individuals, called Qabanchis, visit the premises where their services are required and receive fees from the merchants who employ them ; their testimonv is supposed to prevent subsequent disputes. Another universal institution is Dallalah or agency ; and without the presence of a Dallal, at least on one of the sides, no bargain is ever struck. The principals may be in accord before they meet, but the agreement is only concluded by a Dallal's declaration of the fact, which he generally accompanies by an emphatic gesture; the commission of the Dallal runs from J to 1 per cent. Even European merchants at Baghdad find it advisable to defer to these two local customs: at Basrah, however, there are no Qabanchis. Cash transactions are uncommon in the course of internal trade, a reduction being expected if cash is paid, and the usual method of settlement is by Kambiyalah,* a species .. * 1 ' he T or(i Kambiyalah is used in Egyptian Arabic also. It is derived no doubt from the Italian camhiale, a bill of exchange.'IRAQ of bill or promissory note issued between parties residing in the same place, maturing irl from three months to two years and perfectly negotiable when backed by a good name j or, when the parties belong to different places, by an ordinary inland bill or by sending specie insured through the Post Office, for there is no system of money orders in ^Iraq ; but the last mentioned method is not much in vogue. In foreign trade, orders for goods are sent direct to Europe by the larger firms only, and small merchants generally avail themselves of the credit of the larger to obtain European goods. This is arranged by each of the smaller merchants paying a percentage against his order to the patron ; the patron then obtains and pays for the whole consignment, and on its arrival distri butes the goods to the clients who ordered them,—at Baghdad sometimes on credit, but at Basrah only on receiving cash payment or a Kambiyalah. Some merchants who are without credit in Europe obtain goods thence direct by causing the bill of lading to bo sent to a bank or well-known firm from whose custody they release it by paying the value of the goods according to the invoice. Payment for goods exported to Europe is obtained by the larger merchants through their own agencies there, but they generally draw against the bills of lading to the extent of three-fourths, the balance of the trans action being settled afterwards. Among the smaller merchants a custom prevails of con signing goods to commission agents in Europe and drawing against the bill of lading as soon as the goods are sliipped; but this is a risky method and users of it have frequently been ruined by the failure 6f their consignments, owing to a fall in values, to realise prices equal to the amounts drawn against them. Small merchants also sometimes obtain three-fourths of the value of their bills of lading from the shippers, to whom they make them over, and a complete settlement takes place later between the parties. A European, firm at Baghdad is generally engaged in both import and export trade and conducts its business through native correspondents, each of whom serves it in all the lines in which it may happen to deal. A European house in general business at Baghdad has probably correspondents at Hillah, Masai, Kirkuk, Sulaimaniyah, Kirmanshah and Hamadan through whom, in case of the local rates being favourable, it will order its requirements ; otherwise the arrival of the commodities at Baghdad in the ordinary course of trade will be awaited. European houses seldom, it is said, have cause to complain of dishonesty in their native agents. At Basrah none of the British firms are interested in the import trade to any large extent. Weights.—No account of the commerce of 'Iraq would be complete without a reference to the system of weights and measures, and to the currency, all of which are extremely complicated and confusing. The standards of weight vary from place to place, and we shall therefore deal chiefly with those of Baghdad, the commercial capital. At Baghdad two systems of weighment exist side by side which may be called the local and 0 the non-local The first is applied, with certain exceptions, to local produce and is founded upon the Baghdad or large Huqqah or—in English generally called «' oke ' of 8 lb 12 oz. 8 dr. English: the other has for its basis the Constantinople Huqqah of 21b. 12 oz. 12 dr. English and is used for all imported, and even for certain other articles. The Baghdad local weights remain the same whatever the substance weighed and are as follows :— 1 Ruba' 4 Ruba' == 1 Waqlyah 4 Waqlyah == I Huqqah IJ Huqqahs = 1 Charak .. 4 Charaks = 1 Mann . • 4 Manns = 1 Waznah 20 Waznahs = 1 Taghar The non-local weights are variable: gall-nuts are weighed by the Qantar of 2285 Constantinople Huqqahs or 624 lb. 4 oz. 3^dr. English ; wool by the Mann of 121 Constantinople Huqqahs or 33 lb. 15 oz. 6 dr. English ; wood and charcoal by a Waznah of 50 Constantinople Huqqahs or 139 lb. 3 oz. 8 dr. English; wheat and barley by a different Waznah of 78 Constantinople Huqqahs or 218 lb. 2 oz. 8 dr. English. In the case of wool the Constantinople Huqqah is also called an Astanah ; in the case of gall- nuts it is sub-divided into 4 Waqiyahs of 11 oz. 3 dr. English each; in the case of wood, 20 Waznahs or 1,000 Constantinople Huqqahs make a Taghar of 3,784 lb. 6 oz. 0 dr. lbs. oz. dr.

The French kilogramme, equal to 2*20485 lb. English, is in use to a limited extent as an official measure under the name of Huqqah 'Ashari or decimal Huqqah, and 100 kilogrammes are treated in the case of grain as equivalent to 1 Waznah. Apothecaries employ the French kilogramme with its sub-divisions and multiples. Thus there are at least two kinds of Waqiyah, three of Huqqah, two of Mann, three of Waznah, and two of Taghar in simultaneous use at Baghdad. The foregoing weights correspond to our Avoirdupois; those that follow, used at Baghdad, correspond to our Troy 1 Qirat* or Habbah 16 Qtrat ==. 1 Dirham 1^ Dirham f = 1 Mithqal Baghdad 100 MithqalJ Baghdad = 1 Chaki .. These are used for weighing precious metals and stones: there 'Ajami of 221 Qirats or 69.V grains used only for weighing pearls. At Basrah the unit of local weight is a Huqqah of 2 lb. 12 oz. English and the local Waqiyah is 2| Huqqahs. A Mann of ghi at Basrah is 50 local Huqqahs and a Mann of grain 60; and the Basrah Taghar, containing 1,200 Huqqahs, is treated as roughly equivalent to 1| tons English. Measures.—At Baghdad there are three measures of length, each founded upon a different Dhara' or 'yard.' The Dhara' Baghdad or Baghdad yard is the most gen erally used and i&amp;equal to 29| English inches ; it is subdivided into 4 Charaks of 7/^ inches apiece, and each of these again into 4 'Aqads of Iff inches apiece. The Dhara' Halab or Aleppo yard is employed in measuring silks and woollens and is equal to 26f .inches ; it is sub-divided in a similar manner to the Baghdad yard, giving a Charak consequently of 6| and an 'Aqad of l|i inches. In measuring carpets and in other transactions with Persians the standard is the Dhara' Shah of about 41 inches ;; its Charak, also called a Ruba', equals 10|, and its 'Aqad 21 inches. British goods are estimated in British yards, and other European goods in French metres. Thus we have three different Charaks of length, as well as the Charak of weight, and a Ruba' of length besides- th&amp; Ruba' of weight. There are no standard measures for liquids, and these are sold by the pot or the bottle, the pots being of all sizes and the bottles generally reputed pints or quarts. Distances, except in official measurements which are made by kilometres, are esti mated in hours and days; the unit is the space covered by a walking horse in sixty minutes and so* fluctuates from about 3 to 4| miles. The commonest unit of land measurement is the Faddan, which varies in size from one place to another and at Baghdad is variously defined as ' the- area that two men ean cultivate' or 'a surface that can be completely sown with 500 Huqqahs of wheat and 700 Huqqahs of barley,'* in all 1,200 (Constantinople) Huqqahs. The Baghdad Faddan is also described as containing 200 Donums, each o# 919 square metres, and as being equal to 18 Jarlbs, each of 10,000 square metres- or rather more ; this would give the Faddan an area of about 441 acres. The Donum, it should be mentioned, is sub divided into 1,600 Dhira' Ma'mari. There is also a Juft, the* area that a yoke of bullocks can plough, which is from 70 to 100 Doinums. At Basrah the Faddan is unknown and the unit of land measurement is a Jarib, which is about equal to 1J English acres and is supposed to contain 100 date- palms. Land communications, —Tho subject of land communications is of less importance in Iraq than in most other countries. From the Persian Gulf to Baghdad and Musaiyib^ admirable means of longitudinal communication are supplied by the great rivers, while the need for cross routes is partially met by the Shatt-al'-Gharaf, which links together except in the low season the best navigable portions of the Tigris and Euph rates ; by the meeting-of the two rivers themselves at Qurnah ; and by various canals- such as the Jahalah and Husaimyah, not to mention innumerable marshes and lagoons connected with the rivers, on which boats can ply; In 'Iraq, to speak generally, land routes of any length neither exist nor are required; in the populous districts they would generally be obstructed as well as out-rivalled by water-ways, natural and ♦From this word is derived the name of our carat of 4 grains, t Probably from the Greek drachma, whence also our drachm audi dram. J Doubtless from m&amp;taUiq jeA C52(w}GSB 53898 'IRlQ artificial; while at a distance from the rivers the population ia sparse and shifting, and there is consequently no need for fixed lines of communication. A few very important exceptions must be signalised in the north; namely the routes from Baghdad to the Persian frontier, the routes from Baghdad to the north and nort-west, the routes from Baghdad to Hillah and Karbala, and the route from Karbala to Najaf. In the south, land routes as a rule lie only between adjacent places and are of no consequence ; but the route from Basrah to Safwan forms an exception to the rule, and there is a road between Basrah and Fao behind the date plantations of the Shatt-al-'Arab which is frequented to a considerable extent. Transport and supply. —The general question of transport and supply in 'Iraq is a large one, and it is impossible here to enter on details such as are given in special works on the subject.* Trade is carried on between Baghdad and Karbala chiefly by camels and donkeys, between Baghdad and Khanaqin entirely by mules; and mules predominate in the caravans going from Baghdad to Badrah and Mandali. A fair supply of camels, horses and mules is forthcoming in most of the drier parts of the country. At Baghdad passable riding-horses and excellent mules can be hired for a tour at the rate of one rupee per diem each; if however the journey is of an unusual kind, or less than 10 animals are engaged, the rate may be as much as one and-a-half rupees. A Baghdad mule caravan can, on flat ground, cover from 3 to 3| miles in the hour and'as much as 40 miles in the day. It is advisable to take a written agreement when transport is engaged, even for a private journey. Tibn or chopped wheat and barley straw is the usual fodder and can be had at all seasons ; gfeen food, called Hashish, is at many places obtainable only in the early spring. In cultivated districts there is generally a certain surplus of these two articles and of grain; but the supply is liable to fail in seasons when irrigation or rainfall is deficient. None of the roads of 'Iraq are made roads, but those from Baghdad to Karbala, Hillah and Najaf respectively, to the south and south-west of Baghdad, are fit in ordinary weather for vehicular traffic. Most of the coming and going between Baghdad and Hillah, Baghdad and Karbala, and Karbala and Najaf is by stage-coach. In 1905 there were 26 coaches plying between Baghdad and Musaiyib, 12 between Musaiyib and Karbala; 9 between Karbala and Najaf, and 6 between Baghdad and Hillah: those on the Musaiyib and Karbala line go and return the same day, while the rest go one day and return the next. The coaches resemble covered waggonettes, have four wheels, and are drawn by four horses or mules : they run together in convoys and are generally spoken of as belonging to a Qumbanlyah or company, but in reality they are owned in twos and threes by private individuals. The usual fare between Baghdad and Karbala is one Majidi. A similar service exists between Baghdad and Samarrah. In all 'Iraq there is only one horse tramway, connecting the western suburb of Baghdad with Kadhimain ; it is 3 miles in length and was constructed about 1870 by Midhat Pasha; at that time Wali of Baghdad. At present there is only one railway in 'Iraq, namely the Baghdad railway, which is open for traffic as far as Samarrah. Accommodation for travellers, —At halting-places on the main-routes, as well as in most towns and large villages. Khans or hostelries for travellers are generally found; on the main route to Karbala there are several at each stage. They consist of quadrangu lar enclosures surrounded on the inside by small rooms and stables; in the better sort there are a few superior rooms forming a second storey ; but the sanitary condition of all alike is indescribably bad. Some Khans are public, and at these the accommodation is free ; but the majority are privately owned, and the Khanchi lives by the payments he receives for supplies and by the tips which satisfied travellers usually give him. Boat bridges. —Where bridges over the large rivers exist in 'Iraq they are invariably bridges of boats. The pontoons are lightly constructed of wood and smeared with bitu men ; they are secured to one another by lashings, and the whole bridge is held in position ♦See in particular pages 17 to 25 and 91 to 97 of the Gazetteer of Baghdad, 1889. Since the statistics thero given were compiled the price of horses has risen, and that of mules has fallen, about 20 per cent. Neither the pack-horse nor the mule of the country can carry more than 300 lbs. satisfactorily. The price of donkeys is now from £7 to £10, and they cannot ordinarily carry more than 200 lbs. The local farriers mentioned as available should be discounted, for they are so ignorant as to be more dangerous than useful. A quantity of new informa tion on the subject of transport and supplies has recently become available in Captain H. Smyth's Reconnaissance Report, 1914, which contains some useful estimates : and a few fresh facts will be found in this Gazetteer ja the articles oa llillah Town, Tawairij and Nasirlyah Town.'ie I q 899 'rupee fiimala mule by cables made fast to the bank and by moorings in the stream; a section of several boats is generally made so as to open and fall away, when required, for the passage of steamers and large native craft. The bridge at Baghdad is passable for all vehicles ; but on others the gangways connecting the boats are sometimes so narrow and badly adjusted as to be difficult for animals, and considerable preparation would be required to fit some of them for wheeled traffic. Boat-bridges exist at Samarrah, Kadhimain, Baghdad, Qararah, Kut-al-Amarah and 'Amarah oil the Tigris ; at Fallujah, Musaiyib, Hillah, Nasirlyah and Suq-ash-Shuyukh on the Euphrates ; at Tawairij and Kufah On the Shatt-al-Hindiyah ; and on the Diyalah just above its confluence with the Tigris; Water communicatiomsi —The navigation of the Tigrisj Ejiiphrates, Hindiyah; Gharaf and Diyalah rivers and of the Husainiyah and Jahalah Canals is dealt with in the articles under those names; As already observed, the principal communications of the country are by water. The Tigris is navigable to Musal, but up-stream traffic practically ceases at Baghdad in consequence of rapids and the increased force of the Current above that pointy 'especially at Qanatir; down-stream traffic, however, from Musal to Baghdad is carried on by raft, almost to the exclusion of Other means of transport and some of the rafts descend as far as 'Amarah Town. Regular boat carriage on the Euphrates does not now extend abOve Hillah Town and with difficulty reaches that point: between July and October some of the reaches between Samawahand Hillah cannot be negotiated by boats of size, which must unload at Samawah or Shinafiyah. By entering the Hindlyah through the Bahr-an-Najaf boats from the lower Euphrates can reach the river again at the Hindlyah barrage or Saddah ; as, however, the barrage has no lock, they must here transfer their cargoes to other boats which come to meet them from above. The Shatt-al-Gharaf is not passable in the low season. About Kifl and Kufah, where the roads are unstaged and unsafe, and in the marshy districts generally, the people for the most part move about in boats or canoes. The question of steamers is treated of elsewhere ; biit we may here remark that native sailing boats have the advantage of steamers in the carriage of articles, such as grain and liquorice, which are bulky and have to be collected from point to point, also in down stream work generally, and in most cases where the desideratum is cheapness rather than speed. That the native carrier is willing to dispense with bagging of grain is another point in his favour. The present steamer freight from Baghdad to 'Amarah Town, for instance, is 14«. Sd. a ton, while boat freight is only 9 .9. Passengers by steamer from Bombay sometimes accomplish the journey to Baghdad in 14 days, and goods from Bombay arrive in from 14 days to 6 weeks, or more, with only one transhipment from ocean to river-steamer at Basrah ; goods from England are deliver ed at the Baghdad custom house in periods varying from 40 days to four months and over. Native river boats* —The chief kinds of native boat in use on the rivers and marshes of 'Iraq are the Mahailah, Ballam, Danak, Mushhuf or canoe, Quffah or coracle, and Kalak or raft.f The Mahailah, in some up-country places called a Taradah or Saf nah,{ is found every where from Fao to Baghdad. It is the largest boat seen on the Mesopotamian rivers and varies in length from 30 to 80 feet with a beam slightly less than J of the total length ; it is built with great sheer, giving the midship portion a freeboard of only about one foot when fully loaded, while the gunwale at bow and stern is from 10 to 12 feet above the water. The Mahailah is an open boat and is strengthened with three or four stout cross-beams ; but the larger sizes have a poop, and all have a steering platform aft, as well as a forecastle deck for working the ground tackle and for poling. The stern is pointed and the lines of the vessel are extremely fine. The Mahailah is steered with an ordinary tiller and rudder and has only one mast carrying a lateen sail; there is also a staysail which is hoisted when the wind is too heavy for the larger sail. The Mahailah floats so lightly that a mere rag of canvas will enable it, when unloaded, to advance at a fair speed even against strong current. When wind or river are adverse the Mahailah is poled along in the shallow water close to the bank, or a long coir rope is led from the masthead to the shore by which the crew tow, one man remaining on board to steer. *Authoniy. —Chiefly a special report by Commander A. Rowand, R.LM. tSee illustrations in Vol. Ill of thjs Gazetteer. i Plurals Tararid and Sufun. 5z2900 J IEAQ The crew varies from 3 to 8 men according to the size of the vessel, and from 10 to 100 tons of cargo can be carried. A large Mahailah will contain 60 passengers. The cost of construction of a Mahailah is from £100 to £250 English; The Ballam is the boat par excellence of the Shatt-al-'Arab and its ordinary range is from Qurnah to Fao, but it is found on the Euphrates as far up as Nasiriyah Town. The typical Ballam is a small boat about 20 feet long by 3 feet across at the greatest beam ; in shape it is long and narrow and pointed at both extremities.* It has a platform for poling at either end and is strengthened by cross-beams. The Ballam draws very little water and is generally poled along the bank, but it can also be rowed or sailed : a rudder is shipped when sailing. Three or four men constitute the crew of a Ballam, and it costs from £10 to £15 English to build one. The small passenger Ballams of Basrah are gaily painted and have a scroll ornament at each end. A larger cargo-carrying vessel of the Ballam type is called an 'Araglyah : it may be as much as 60 feet in length and carry a load of 50 tons. The home of the 'Araglyah is on the Euphrates and Hindlyah from Samawah to Hillah ; and it is said to take its name from the river ports of this neighbourhood which are called collectively 'Arag, a word which has possibly some connection with the name 'Iraq ; on the Tigris, however, the term 'Araglyah is used somewhat loosely to describe any boat from the Euphrates. The Danak has much the same distribution as the Mahailah but it is not nearly so common unless perhaps on the Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Hillah and Dlwani- yah. It is an open boat 30 to 40 feet in length and pointed at bow and stern, with a platform at each end and cross-beams in , the waist. The stem and stern-post rise 3 to feet above the gunwale in order that they may stand clear when the vessel is loaded up with datestalks or such produce. There is one mast carrying a lateen sail, the steering- gear consists of a rudder and tiller and the hull, which is of wood, is coated with bitumen. Poling is resorted to in shallow water. The crew consists of about 5 or more men, and both cargo and passengers are carried, but the capacity of the Danak does not commonly exceed 12 tons. A Danak costs £ 15 to £ 20 English to build. The mast in all the vessels described above is called Shaiyal; the sails are Shira'; and the poles for propelling are Maradi. The Mashhuf is a light plank or reed-canoe, covered with bitumen, which is used in the marshy tracts upon the Tigris and Euphrates above the if confluence at Qumah. Mashhufs are built in considerable numbers at Qal'at Salih and Suq-ash-Shuyukh, and the positions of these two places sufficiently indicate the country to which the Mashhuf belongs. The length of the Mashhuf is from 15 to 18 feet,t and it can be very rapidly propelled by one man, who sits as far aft and as low as possible, and strikes the water with a paddle upon either side alternately. The Mashhuf, if managed with care, Will carry altogether 4 or 5 men, and occasionally a second oarsman sits in the bow. There is a species of large Mashhuf called a Qaiyarlyah, also bitumen-covered but built of thin planking ; it has a mast, sail, rudder and tiller, but is reckoned an inferior boat. The name is derived from Qlr^ meaning bitumen. 1 Baghdad is the headquarters of the Quffah, and 500 are said to belong to that place ; but it is seen as far south as Basrah and as far west as the Husainlyah canal. It is a j circular coracle, shaped like an Indian water-jar, or in more precise terms a hollo# oblate i spheroid with the central portion of the top removed. Quffahs are ordinarily 4 to 5 feet in diameter, but some are as small as 3 feet 8 inches and others as large as 10 feet; &lt; the former may be as little as 2 feet 6 inches in depth and the latter as much as 3 feet ' 6 inches. In construction the Quffah is nothing else than a strong wickerwork basket thickly coated with bitumen and costing £ 5 or less. The ordinary Quffah is propelled by two men with paddles and will carry 4 or 5 passengers, but a very large one can convey 20 persons, or one camel and several passengers. The Quffah does not advance well against the current; but it is very safe, being little liable to accident in case of a collison. • By fishermen descending the stream a bundle of hurdles, marking the end of the net, is * sometimes sent in advance of the Quffah, while the vessel itself is retarded by a heavy ■'This is the Ballam 'Ashari; it is used for passenger traffic and as a lighter; it is sometimes as much as 50 feet Ion? ; a large one will carry 20 passengers. There is also a pattern called Ballam &gt; T assari, 40 or 50 feet long, in which cargo is carried between Basrah and Kuwait. Both types are built at Kuwait, but Ballams are not owned at that port. t A Mashhuf seen at Basrah» however* measured 32 feet In length, 3i feet In beam, and 1 foot and 7 inches Cepth.'w 'IRAQ 901 i are gaily Stone attached to a rope and dragging along the bottom of the river. The larger Mahailahs sometimes have a Quffah as dinghy. There is also a class of small boat On the Euphrates about Musaiyib which is called 8ajah. Tbe last and most primitive kind of river craft in 'Iraq are the Kalaks or rafts which come down from Musal to Baghdad and sometimes to 'Amarah Town. They consist of a square or oblong platform, either of timber or built up with iayers of crossed branches to a thickness of 1| or 2 feet and then covered with rough planks: the usual size is 14 by 15 feet to 16 by 18 feet, but some are even 30 feet long. The buoyancy of the materials is increased by 30 to 50 inflated skins which are attached to the submerged portion of the platfom ; the Kalak can Only move with the current and is kept in mid stream by means of two roughly fashioned sweeps. These rafts bring with them pottery,' wood, fruit, empty oil-tins, etc., which they sell on the way to villagers and Bedouins ; on arrival at their destination they are broken up, the wood being sold as scantlings to house-builders and the skins conveyed up the river again to the original point of departure. The load of a Kalak varies from 5 to 30 tons. It is impossible. Owing to defective registration, to obtain a clear idea of the number of boats which exist on the rivers.* At Basrah Town, in 1903-04, there were 635 mastless and 475 masted vessels upon the Government books } but the Naqib of Basrah alone then owned 200 boats, other notables among them perhaps 50, and a large number of private individuals 3 or 4 each, none of which were registered. Mashhufs, too, ar© never registered. The chief seats of boat-building are Basrah Town and Sangar on the Shatt-al-'Arab below Basrah. The times taken by native boats to ascend and descend the large rivers are extremely uncertain, varying with wind and current: thus the upward journey from Basrah to Bahgdad varies between 15 and 45 days, and the downward journey from Baghdad to Basrah between 10 and 30 days, but river and wind both being favourable Basrah may even be reached from Baghdad in 5 days. In the tables which follow below of the administrative divisions of 'Ir'aq as they existed under Turkish rule, opportunity has been taken to insert some details elucidative of facts given in the paragraphon population above. The Baghdad Wilayat consists of 3 Sanjaqs, viz,, those of Baghdad and Diwamyah, which are both of the first class, and that of Karbala which belongs to the second class.

Department of Land Records. —-In order to understand the work of the Land Records Department, it is necessary first to explain the classification of land according to ownership which prevails in 'Iraq as in the Turkish Empire. There are 5 principal kinds of landed property. The first kind is Mulk or freehold property, over which the owner has full power in life and in death. It may be trans mitted by inheritance or by legacy, and only in event of failure of heirs does it escheat to the Bait-al-Mal or Treasury. Mulk is of 4 sorts,but on this minute, classification it is unnecessary to enter. Mulk, in 'Iraq, consists chiefly of land in the neighbourhood of villages which has been purchased by the villagers from Government. The second sort of land is Miri or that which belongs to the state ; it comprises arable lands, pasture, and forests, and the ownership thereof is vested in the Bait-al-Mal. Lands of the third kind are Waqf: those, namely, of which the profits are assigned for religious purposes. Waqf lands that are under the management of the Department of Religious Endowments, to which we shall refer in another paragraph, are ipso facto free of taxation ; while those in the hands of private individuals are taxed to the same extent as similar lands which are not Waqf. The large landed properties owned by or vested in the Nabiq of Baghdad, however, have been specially exempted from taxation by an Imperial edict and may therefore be regarded as Waqf in the public sense. Matrukah lands, or such as are not individual property and are left unoccupied for the public benefit, compose the fourth class. The fifth category consists of Mawat, or Dead Lands, which have remained uninhabited and uncultivated from time immemorial. The lands owned by the Sultan of Turkey as an individual and managed on his behalf by the Dairat-as-Saniyah or Civil List Department, of which we shall have something to say further on, may now almost be taken as constituting a sixth variety of land. These lands are known as Aradhi Saniyah; they are private domains, and they must not be confounded with Aradhi Miriyah, or lands of the second kind, which are public or state domains.

IZKI or ZIKI—• An importanttown of'Oman Proper in the Sultanate of 'Oman; it is situated on both sides of Wadi Halfain about 12 miles below its head and at an elevation of 2,150 feet above the sea. The quarter situated on the right bank is walled and contains a compact and massive fort with walls 5 feet thick, standing upon a cliff 200 feet high above the Wddi bed ; this quarter is called Yaman, has about 350 houses and is inhabited by the Bani Ruwahah, Daramikah and Manadharah tribes. The quarter on the left bank stands on low ground and is occupied by Bani Riyam : it is called Nizar and has about 450 houses. These opposite quarters are constantly at feud, the one being Hinawi and the other Ghafiri in politics. The entire population of Izki proper may be about 4,000 souls : the people are cultivators and carriers. The bed of Wadi Halfain at Izki is broad and contains extensive palm-groves and other cultivation, especially on the left bank which is low and fertile; the general aspect of the town is highly picturesque. Crops910 1ZB-IZZ 909 are wheat, barley, millet, lucerne, beans, sesame and sugarcane, the date palms are es timated at 10,000. Irrigation is from springs which are among the most copious in 'Oman. Outside Izki are several small hamlets and watch-towers of the Yal 'Umair and other tribes, among them Zikait, a small quadrangular walled village containing 15 houses of the Bani Riyam, which is situated further down Wadi Halfain and about 1 mile south-east of Izki. The possession of the Izki fort, commanding as it does the main or Wadi Samail route between the coast and the interior, is of vital importance to the Sultan of 'Oman. At the present time the fort is held in his name by a garrison of 20 'Askaris and his authority is represented by a resident Wali. The Zakat collected by the Wali amounts annually to about $1,600, but the whole of this sum goes in local administrative expenses.

J A'ALAN— A district in the 'Oman Sultanate lying to the south-east of Sharqiyah, of which some authorities consider it to be a division. Its greatest length is about 50 miles from the coast at Lashkharah north-eastwards to the confines of Badiyah in Sharqiyah ; its limits on the north-east and south-west are undetermined, so also is its extent upon the sea where, however, it certainly includes the strip from Ras-ar-Ruwais to Lashkharah; but its breadth appears to be somewhat less than its length. On the north it is shut in and overlapped by the easternmost hills of Hajar; on the south it is enclosed by sandy desert. Physical characteristics. —There is a hill called Jabal Qahwan belonging to this district which is situated 20 miles inland from the coast a little north of Lashkharah : its height is 2,600 feet and it is probably a southern spur of the Jabal Khamls range of Hajar. Hills called Jabal Mashaikh are said to occur near the west end of the district. Around Humaidha, Kamil and Wafi, streams afford abundant irrigation and the country is well cultivated. Between these villages and Balad Bani Bu Hasan is an extensive plain, covered with acacia and consisting alternately of very loose drift-sand and of whitish, indurated clay. From Balad Bani Bu 'Ali to Lashkharah the ground is at first level and firm with a few acacias, then broken and sandy. For 25 or 30 miles south-south west of Balad Bani Bu 'Ali there is an open waste without trees or water, then a narrow ridge of low calcareous hills, then mounds thickly interspersed with gum Arabic trees ; these sandy mounds continue for several hours' journey. To the west of the last men tioned tract are arid plains without trees or bushes, displaying alternately a pebbly surface and saline incrustations. Topography. —The chief permanently inhabited places which Ja'alan contains are given in the following table : with the exception of Ras-ar-Ruwais, Suwaih, Jumailah and Lashkharah, which are on the coast, they are situated close together on a plain in the heart of the district. About Jabal Qahwan are some small and unimportant settle ments of the Mashaikh-al-Jabal and Bani Sarhan who are connected with the Bani Bu912 JA'ALlN Hasan tribe.

Lashkharah is also a port for all the Ghafiri tribes subject to the TamTmah of the Bani Bu 'Ali. There are date plan tations irrigated by springs. The palms number about 1,000, and there are 50 camels but few other animals. See article South- Eastern Coast of 'Oman. See article South- Eastern Coast of 'Oman.

JABALIYAH— The Jabaliyah are a loose confederation of independent tribes acknowledging no common Shaikh, but united by common interests and conditions. They are known either as the Jabaliyah or by the older name of Zubaid. They inhabit the volcanic districts to east and south of the Jabal Hauran and the Lejah between the Hauran hills and Damascus. They own a little cultivated land, mainly in the Kuhbah, and flocks of sheep, but few camels. They are as a whole, poor and of bad reputation ; like all tribes on the frontier of the desert they rob and pillage their neighbours, the settled inhabitants, but they usually escape unpunished ; for the Sltan's writ fails a few miles out of Damascus and the stony camping grounds of the Jabaliyah are difficult of approach. The Ghiyadh used to plunder the desert post when it travelled fortnightly across the desert to Baghdad. Since its cessation, in 1912, they have occupied the outlying Turkish station, the qishlah east of Dhumair, which was abandoned by the gendarmerie. The Jabaliyah are close allies of the Druze, of whom they stand in awe. They pasture the Druze flocks in the low-lying Safa during the winter, and in summer come up into the foothills of the Jabal Hauran. They are usually on bad terms with the Anazeh, and steal the sheep and camels of the Wald 'Ali and Haseneh whenever an opportunity offers ; and they are always at feud with the Bani Sakhr, who are the foes of the Druze. The Masa'id are said to be the most numerous of the Jabaliyah tribes ; the Ghiyadh are next in importanca. It is doubtful whether the term Zubaid includes the Ghiyadh, though the latter are certainly reckoned among the Jabaliyah. Jabaliyah. Masa'id. 600—600 tents. Ghiyadh Adhamat. Sherafat. Hadiyeh.

The Bani Jabir boast their descent from the tribe of Dhubyan, famous in Arab poetry, and are at bitter enmity with the Bani Ruwahah who are derived from the rival tribe of Abs. Hilam and Tau are equally regarded as capitals of the tribe ; but the Bani Jabir, though dispersed, keep up communication with one another and act as a body. Saiyid Turki, during his troublous reign, from 1871 to 1888, frequently employed the Bani Jabir to close the passes leading to Masqat against his enemies in Sharqiyah.

JABIR (W adi B ant ) (II)— In the Hajar district of the 'Oman Sultanate, the only important tributary from the west of Wadi Samail, which it joins at Miltiqa ; its head is below ' Aqbat-al-Qatt, on the east side. The course of Wadi Bani Jabir is approximately parallel to that of Wadi Samail above Milfciqa: Saijah, near its beginning, is divided from Darwazeh in Wadi Samail only by about 4 miles of open country and is visible from it. The villages in Wadi Bani Jabir in order from its head downwards are given below; almost the entire population are Bani Jabir :— Number Village. Position. On which of bank. houses.

JABKIN— Sometimes pronounced Yabrln. A remarkable oasis, said to lie five caravan days to the east of Aflaj and eight to the south-west of D5hah in Qatar: one of the nearest well known points to it upon the coast is Khor-al-'Odaid. Jabrin is 150 to 160 miles south-south-west of Hofuf and about 180 miles south-west by west from the foot of Khor-al-'Odaid. On the western side of Jabrin the country consists of barren clay plains traversed by the route from Aflaj ; on the other three the oasis is surrounded by sandy desert. The districts or tracts surrounding Jabrln are Dahanah on the north and west, Ahqaf on the south and Jafurah on the east. Jabrin is about 10 miles in length from north to south and 7 or 8 in breadth from east to west. It is a plain, lower in level 1 than the surrounding country and watered by springs and streams; the drainage goes to the eastern desert in which it is swallowed up. There is good grass, and over the whole surface of the plain wild date palms are scattered in patches. Jabrin is frequented by the A1 Morrah Bedouins who collect the dates in the season; it is said that it was once permanently inhabited and that coins and other relics of civilisation are still found there: its abandonment is attributed to a change of climate by which it became mala • rious. The nearest village in Aflaj is Saih, and there is an intermediate halting-place at Mishash, two days from Saih and three from Jabrin, where Dawasir Bedouins encamp in the midst of clay plains. The wells on routes leading to it from Hofuf and the Persian Gulf atre specified in the article on Jafurah. No European has as yet visited Jabrin. Leachman says that the whole of Jabrin is under the sway of Ibn Sa'ud and that at opposite ends of the valley there are the ruins of two large towns.

JABUR (AL)— A tribe of 'Iraq, generally considered to be constituents of the Zubaid (q.v.). They have two main divisions, namely, Jabur Al Bu Khattab and Jabur-al-Wawi; the former live on the Tigris south of Baghdad round the mouth of the Diyalah, and the latter on the Euphrates below Hillah. The organisation of the Jabur Al Bu Khattab has not yet been satisfactorily ascartain- ed, the Shamamtah Jabur, of the Kadhimain Qadha, are probably a section. The Al Bu Khattab are sheep-breeders and are everywhere half-settled. They inhabit villages, but their flocks wander over the country between the two rivers.

The latter live on the Khabur river, a district which does not come within the scope of this gazetteer. For the sake of clearness, however, and to avoid confusion between these two tribes, it may be here noted that the northern Jabur, who aggregate perhaps two or three thousand tents, are divided into the following sections :— Al Fadhil, Al Lahaib, Al Milhim, and Al-Hasan-al-Mushaikh. The tribe pay tribute to the Shammar and winter at Ras-al-'Ain. Their chief Shaikh is at present (1916) Muslut Pasha as-Salih-ibn-Milhim, whose qasr\s near Taban, on the Khabur river.

The village lies amidst date groves surrounded by mud walls. There are two khans, one near the southern entrance to the village, about 80 yards square, with stabling for about 200 horses and a well in the centre with fairly good water standing at about 20 feet from the surface. This khan has on the roof a low parapet of mud about two feet high and 15 inches thick ; on the roof are two staircases in the north-west and south-east corners. The other khan is some 300 yards north of the first and 150 yards from the river bank, with nothing between it and the river. The khan is perhaps 6c2924 JAD—JAF 60 yards square, with stabling for 100 horses. In the centre of each Ichdn is a circular hole 15 yards in diameter and 4 feet deep in the centre.

JlFURAH—* A great desert in Eastern Arabia ; it extends the whole way from the Hasa Oasis to the confines of Trucial 5 Oman, and its eastern edge is nowhere very far inland from the coast of the Persian Gulf. By some Arabs Jafurah is regarded as a projection in the direction of Qatar of the Ruba'-al-Khali or Great Desert of Southern Arabia ; and those who view the matter in this light say that Jafurah ends, and that the Ruba'-al-Khali proper begins, in the region known as Ahqaf or the Sand Dunes. Limits. —'Whether or not it be a part of the Ruba'-al-Khali, Jafurah is in itself a remarkable and very extensive desert. In shape it is roughly triangular, with its apex on the north almost touching a line drawn between Hofuf and 'Oqair Port, and its other corners (to the south-west and south-east) adjoining the oasis of Jabrm and the southern extremity of Sabakhat Matti respectively. Along its western side Jafurah is met in succession from north to south by the tracts of Biyadh, Kharmah, Ghuwar, Na'alah, Summan and Dahanah; on the east it is separated from the sea, in the same order, by Barr-al-Qarah, Qatar, 'Aqal and Mijan ; on the south it is bounded by the Ruba'-al- Khali. It may be added here that Jafurah encloses Jabrin upon the north and east, and that, in the opinion of some, Barr-al-Qarah is a portion of Jafurah and not a separate tract. Physical characteristics and inhabitants. —Jafurah differs from the waterless Ruba'-al- Khali only in possessing a few wells of very bitter water and a little scanty grazing ; its surface consists of red and burning sand. The 'Ajman venture into the northern extremity of Jafurah ; but the only tribe who frequent it to any considerable extent are the hardy Al Morrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from more powerful enemies. The Al Morrah are said to wear when in Jafurah a specially thick foot-gear made of camels' hair; and, if popular rumour may be trusted, those of the tribe who spend most time there are of an unusually swarthy complexion, while their camels are nearly jet black. •Nearly the whole of the information contained in this article was supplied by Captain P. B. Prideaux Political Agent in Bahrain, in whose Map of Jafurah, etc., the region in question is included.926 jaf C rah While sojourning in Jafurah the Al Morrah as a rule drink nothing but the milk of their camels and even cook their rice in the same ; if compelled to swallow water from the wells they first mix it with dried dates to make it more palatable. The Wahhabis have frequently waged war upon the Al Morrah; but Faisal alone, if local tradition is to be believed, succeeded in penetrating with his troops as far as Banaiyan, and his force was so reduced by the hardships of the desert march that he was compelled, on his arrival there, to grant the tribe exceedingly easy terms.

JAHAINAH— A village on the right bank of the Tigris, 36 minutes by raft below Hammam 'Ali and just over four hours below Mosul. It consists of 100 houses of Jabur-al-Wawi Arabs. In the low season the Tigris is fordable at Jahainah. It is said that the rapids at Jahai- nah, like those at Sanadlq, are due to artificial obstacles in the river, and at both places cut stones and building work are visible when the river is low. Jahainah is the more complete of these two constructions, each of which has a passage for rafts through the middle of it. The inhabitants say that they were sills made by Nimrud to raise the level of the river near his town, and it would seem natural to suppose that they were dams of some sort rather than bridges.— {Lorimer, May 1910.)

JAHAISH AH— One of the quarters of the town of Raudhah {q.v.), JAHAL— Some wells in Sudah {q.v.), in the Kuwait Principality. JAHALAH— The name is generally pronounced Chahalah. This large canal, by Europeans often called ' the Hadd, ' waters part of the 'Amarah and Zubair Qadhas in 'Iraq : it takes out of the Tigris on its left bank at the northern end of 'Amarah Town, and, circling round the east side of the place, is spanned at the back of it by a short pontoon bridge. The Jahalah was made less than a century ago ; but, forming a straight continuation of the Tigris at a point where there is a bend in its natural course, it has been enlarged by the action of the river and is now about 80 yards wide at its mouth and abstracts, along with the Bitairah canal on the opposite bank a few miles further up, nearly half of the whole water of the river. The Jahalah runs inland to the Hawlzeh marshes in which it eventually loses itself; but it is understood to pursue a well-defined course, more or less parallel to the Tigris, as far south as Qal'at Salih. For some two-thirds of this distance, to a village called Masa'idah in the Zubair Qadha, it has a depth of about five feet at low water and the channel though narrow is clear ; to this point it might be navigated by a small river steamer, but the passage beyond, if there is one, is obstructed by reeds. Much of the land ia the ueighbourhood of the Jahalah was formerly owned by the Dairat- as - Samy ah. C52(w)GSB 6i&gt;930 J AH—J AH The various branches into which the Chahalah breaks up below Masa'idah have different names in their different parts. The tail ends of the various branches are locally called bazayiz, (corresponding to the dhandib of the date canals). If the canals are taken in order from the east they run as follows : The Hasechi with its tail end known as the Jarrayah. The Umm-ut-Tus, also feeding the Jarrayah to some extent. The Michariyah.

JAHRAH— Sometimes pronounced Jaharah. A considerable village in the Kuwait Principality, situated near the foot of Kuwait Bay, about 2 miles inland, 40 feet above sea level, and distant 20 miles by road from Kuwait Town : it is the chief and almost the only seat of agriculture in Kuwait territory. Situation. —Jahrah stands in an open plain of sand sprinkled with camel grazing, 31 miles to the south-east of the gap in the Zor hills through which caravans from Kuwait to Basrah pass ; the desert rises gradually from the village towards the west and south west. One mile to the north of the village is a plain called Maraitabah, on which Be douins camp in the hot weather : it is riddled with wells containing water at a depth of 12 feet. The few trees about Jahrah, except the dates belonging to the village, are either tamarisks or bers. The air of the place is dry and the climate healthy. Defences. —Jahrah is commanded at artillery ranges by the Zor hills, and, owing to the shoal water at the foot of Kuwait Bay, the place could not be effectively supported by naval fire. The only defensive work is a fortified residence of the Shaikh of Kuwait on the south-east side of the village outside the limits of cultivation. In form it is ap proximately a square, having the angles to the cardinal points and sides of about 200 feet in length, the height of the walls is 15 feet, and there is a tower 20 feet high at each corner enfilading the wall; the only entrance, commanded from within by an old muzzle- loading gun, is in the north-west face. The enclosure contains stabling for about 100 horses. The fort is in bad repair, and its chiefs uses appear to be as the residence of a Mutair wife of the Shaikh and as a place for keeping his brood mares and young stock. A new date plantation and garden, the property of the Shaikh, stand in front of the en trance at a few yards' distance ; they are about 12 acres in extent and are enclosed by walls. There is no well in the fort. Population. —The permanent inhabitants of Jahrah are mostly cultivators of Najd 1 extraction, who till the lands possessed here by the Shaikh and various merchants of Kuwait and by relations of the Naqib of Basrah. The houses, 86 in number, are built of clay and accommodate about 100 families or 500 souls. In the hot weather the population is increased by about 700 households, mostly of the Mutair tribe, who pitch their tents near the village ; and even in winter there are generally one or two Bedouin encampments within sight. Agriculture. —As the importance of Jahrah is chiefly agricultural, and as most of the cultivation in the Shaikh's dominions is concentrated here, we proceed to give a full account of the place in this aspect. There is no fixed scale for the division of produce between landowner and tenant. The staple crops are wheat, barley, and lucerne, the amount of barely being about double that of wheat ;.the total yield of wheat in a good year is about 120 maundsonly. The wheat, called hintah or hubb, is sown at the beginning of September and is reaped along with the barley or sha'ir at the beginning of March. A part of the cereal crops is cut green for fodder as in India, and is called qasll ; the barley is twice cut for this purpose before it is allowed to mature ; but the young wheat is seldom so treated except in unusually good years. The lucerne, called qatt, is of excellent quality and is cultivated on the same ground for four years, after which the plot is left hdilah or fallow for one year. Other crops are the musk melon or hatiJch and the water melon or raqi which are sown once a year, ripen about the beginning of November, and continue in season for three weeks ; the quantity grown is too small to admit of export to Kuwait Town. The pumpkin or qara 1 comes in at the beginning of December, lasts for three months, and is exported to Kuwait Town. Beans or bdjila {i.e., baqilla) ripen in February, but the crop is small and only sufficient for village requirements. The onion or basal is ready at the end of December and continues till spring; the radish, called arwaid, 6D2932 JAHEAH begins early in the year and outlasts the onion. The leek or baqal is sown afresh every year ; it is cropped like lucerne and yields 16 crops in the season. Clover or halhah and cress or rashdd are small and short-lived crops ; these herbs are only used for seasoning. The brinjal or bahdiydn, bindi or bdmiyah, and the tomato—which has no Arabic name—come early in the year and do not last long, but are exported to Kuwait Town. There are about 2,000 date trees at Jahrah producing about 500 maunds of dates per annum; practically the whole of the fruit is eaten as ratab, that is, in the yellow or semi-ripe state. Date plantations, now number eleven, of which the best belongs to Saiyid Khalaf, a relation of the Naqib of Basrah ; three new date groves are being laid out this year (1904). At present only about 30 tons of grain are exported yearly to Kuwait Town, but the agriculture of Jahrah might be greatly extended if more capital were sunk in it. Irrigation.—The crops enumerated above are mostly irrigated and are grown in en closures formed by clay walls about 9 feet high ; most of these gardens are on the south side of the village. Some of the wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone, but the area of such cultivation is small compared with the rest. The water for irrigation is brackish ; it is raised in skins by donkeys which pull by walking down an inclined plane that slopes away from the well. There are 19 large wells with an average depth of about 20 feet. A water lift is called an arjlyah, and the channels which carry the water from the well head to the crops are sdqiyah. Sometimes the water raised is collected in a reservoir or birkah to give it a good flow; natural or artificial hollows where water collects are known as khabrahs. A sharb is a small embanked terrace on which irrigation water is allowed to spread before being let go to a lower level. Agricultural ^ms.—Late-sown crops are described as musaiyaf. The chief varieties of soil are harrah, or good arable land ; daim, which is land either situated on the edge of a hhabrah or watered only by rain ; hazam, or stony ground ; and sabdkhah, which is swampy, saline and non-productive. The commonest instruments of agriculture are a rudimentary plough, called ifqdu ; an iron spade, called fakJiin, used in making, repair ing, opening and closing water channels ; and a wooden rake or hoe, called masdh, for levelling the ground. The makhyvl is a bogey made of an 'aba hung on a stafi to prevent sheep and goats from straying, or to scare birds from growing crops. An economical substitute for a wall to protect crops against animals is a khadad or ditch, 2 feet deep and 2 feet broad, with sand walls on either side about 1 foot high. Livestork, water-supply, etc.—The supply of fowls, eggs and milk at Jahrah is limited and wood is very scarce, but there are plenty of sheep and goats and a few cattle. Lucerne and some vegetables are procurable. The local transport available consists of some 30 or 40 donkeys, but camels can be hired from the Bedouins. Drinking water of fair quality is yielded by certain wells about half a mile south-west of the village. Administration and political importance.—The Shaikh of Kuwait is represented at Jahrah by one Amir 'Abdul Karim, a native of the village but of Najdi parentage, who exercises considerable undefined powers in the place. This man is also the Shaikh's agent for the cultivation of his garden, already mentioned, and takes half the profits of the same while the Shaikh bears all the expenses. No revenue is collected on behalf of the Shaikh. In former times the disorderly conduct of the Bedouins frequently caused annoyance at Jahrah; but under the strong rule of Mubarak this drawback has been The Shaikh of Kuwait regards Jahrah as one of the most important spots in his terri tory, not only on account of its agricultural resources, but also because of the prestige which its possessor enjoys among the Bedouins frequenting its vicinity and of the hold which it gives him over them. removed.

JANIN— A section of the Daru* tribe {q. v.) of the 'Oman Sultanate. JANNABAH— Singular Jannaibi. A large tribe of the 'Oman Sultanate, Yamani by extraction, but now belonging to the Ghafiri political faction and Sunnis in religion. They are partly settled and partly nomad. Their metropolis is Sur; but they also possess Masirah island and interspersed with Hikman and A1 Wahibah, occupy in a desultory fashion the south-east coast of'Oman from Ras Jibsh, where they have a village, to the commence ment of the Dhufar District; some of them visit Murbat in Dhufar, and the cave dwellings on Ras Sajar and the small hamlet of Safqot at the west end of Dhufar are said to be occupied by members of this tribe. A few reside among the Hikman of Mah5t. Detached colonies of Jannabah are found at Bahlah, Khadhra-bin-Daffa' and 'Izz in 'Oman Proper and at Wadi Manumah in Batinah. It is necessary to distinguish the settled portion of the tribe, chiefly at Sur, from the migratory pastoral and fishing sections further to the south.. The former, known in com mon with some of the Bani Bu 'Ali as ' Suris,' own and navigate a large number of sea going vessels which run to Bombay, Zanzibar and the Red Sea ; they are also merchants having large commercial depots at Sur, and the Hajriyin of the interior carry on all their foreign trade through them. The pastoral portion of the tribe are dark-skinned, thin and undersized but not ill-looking ; they wear their hair long and confine it round the head with a leathern thong. They are disliked by their neighbours and appear to have little or no religion. In the cool season they come down to the coast with their herds of camels and goats, which are said to be very large, retreating again to caves in the hills on the approach of the southwest monsoon. It has been noticed that those who fish are of a lighter complexion than their purely pastoral brethren and that their cranial and facial type is more or less peculiar to themselves. As a tribe the Jannabah bear an evil reputation. Those of Sur indulged in slave- dealing and even piracy as long as these courses were open to them, and the Jannabah of the south-eastern coast are wreckers and robbers to a man. # The Jannabah are divided into the following sections;—• Section. Fighting strength.* R emarks. 'Aramah ., ,. 400 At Sur. Fawaria 600 At Sur, in Ja'alan, and on Masirah island. Ghaiyalln 450 At Sur and on MasTrah island. Maja'alah ., ,, 300 Nil Makhanah .. 500 At Sur and on Masirah island. These sections are generally found intermingled at the places occupied by the tribe. Some of each section are Bedouins. The total number of the Jannabah may be about 12,000 souls, of whom over 9,000 are settled ; but the strength of the nomad portion who ♦Evidently uoder-estimated.940 JAN-JAR inhabit the southern desert is necessarily difficult to estimate.

JAR AMAH (Khor-AL)— An inlet of the sea which breaks the coast-line of the 'Oman Sultanate at a point 12^ miles east of the Sur creek and 4 miles west of Ras-al-Hadd. The entrance, which runs from north to south, is a mile long and winds between cliffs 60 feet high ; it breadth is about 150 yards, but the channel at one point contracts to 60 yards and at the inner end it is divided into two by an island. Inland the Khor expands into a large, shallow basin with a length of 2J miles from north-west to south-east, surrounded for the most part by cliffs, 100 to 200 feet high but having, at its south end, a low and shelving beach with a few scattered trees. The interior of the inlet forms a perfectly sheltered harbour which is easily accessible to steam-vessels drawing less than 15 feet of water. Fish abound, and there are wells on the southern beach yielding brackish but drinkable water sufficient for a caravan of 200 camels and an equal number of men. The owners of the place are the Muwalikh tribe of Hadd, and the only actual occupants at the present time are a few fishermen who have some miserable huts near the wells already mentioned; but the ruins of a considerable village, said to have been called Labid, are traceable close to the same spot. Disputes regarding the free use of Khor-al-Jaramah by mariners occurred between 1877 and 1880, and the British authorities were obliged to intervene.

Jassan is a halting-place on the route from Kut-al-Amarah to Badrah and Zorbatiyah and can generally provide a fair amount of livestock and fodder. It was formerly a second class Nahiyah of the Badrah Qadha which latter was estimated to contain some 15,000 souls.

JAUF— A tract m the Hasa Sanjaq, beginning about 8 miles north of the oasis of that name it is divided from the latter by a small strip of the Biyadh tract which intervenes. On the west side of Jauf a line connecting Jabal Gharaimil with Jabal Dam divides it from the tract of Badd-al-Asis ; and, at its north-western corner, only the interposition of Jabal Dam prevents its meeting the Habl tract. On the remaining sides it is enclosed by Biyadh. The length of Jauf from north-west to south-east is rather over 30 miles • and its average breadth, taken at right angles to its length, is about half as much. Jauf is a sandy depression and its surface is composed of mounds and hollows all of sand. The general colour of the track is darker than that of Biyadh. The hollows contain trees of Markh and bushes of Ghadha, and in the grazing are included the shrubs called 'Arfaj, and Rimth and the grasses known as Nasi, Subat, and Thamam. In most respects Jauf resembles Habl, which it adjoins, but it is better provided with water. Wells are numerous in Jauf and the average depth is about 12 feet. The following are among the better known :— B Name. Position. Asaifirat Bar (' Ain) .. In the centre of the northern part of Jauf, 8 milaa east of Jabal Dam and 8 miles north of Jabal Gharaimil.

Of these welk Asaifirat, 'Ain Dar, Ruwaqi and Shara' are said to be the best while Nasab and Sawud are among the worst. Jauf belongs to the 'Aj man tribe of Bedouins and the Bani Haji also visit it under their auspices. JAUF— The central portion of 'Oman Proper {q. v.), JAUF— A fertile district in Yemen, the centre of which is in Lat. 16° 20' N., Long. 44° 50' or perhaps 80 miles north-east from Sana'a. It is watered by Wadi Hirran which, uniting with Wadi Kharid at Al-'Aish, runs through Jauf for some 30 miles to the desert. The principal inhabitants are the Dhu Husain and the Bani Nauf divisions of the Bakii918 JAU—JAU tribe. Halevy, who visited Jauf in 1869-70, gives Al-Ghail and Al-Hazm among the chief villages in the valley, and further north in the adjacent oases of Al-Marashi and Al-Khab, Husn Marikh and Al-Mikar. Jauf was in ancient days the seat of the Minaean kingdom and many ascriptions of interest were found by Halevy at the ruined city of Ma in and the neighbourhood of Al-Hazm. He desecribes Al-Khab as every where well cultivated, the fields circling round the hills in artificial terraces and watered by numberless wells sunk in the rock. Long rows of trees are planted ; fruit and viticulture are not very successful owing to the extreme dryness of the climate. The villages are near together, generally on the slope of a hill in steps. Some are on the banks of the torrents which meander over the plains in the rainy season. The houses are chiefly of sun-dried brick, but many of those of the well- to-do are of stone. There is a large colony of Jews in Jauf and they appear to be very well treated.— (Waubope.) J AUF-AD-DARWISH— A station on the Hejaz rilaway 397-5 kilometres from Damascus and 61 *64 north of Ma'an. There is an old stone qaVah on the Hajj route here. The railway station consists of one building and a loop siding 250 yards in length. There is no water. JAUF-AL- 'UMR— The largest town in the dominions of the Amir of Jabal Shammar in Central Arabia ; it lies, entirely surrounded by deserts, about 365 miles south-west of Baghdad, 225 miles north-west of Hail and 310 miles south-east of Damascus. Site. —Jauf-al-'Umr is about 1,850 feet above sea-level. It is situated on a dead flat plain forming the bottom of an extraordinary depression of oval form which has a maximum diameter, from north-west to south-east, of rtoarly 3 miles. The walls of the depression are sandstone hills supporting a desert plain some 500 feet higher-than Jauf. These hills are called on the north side Jal-al-Jauf, and on the south side Tabaiq ; behind Tabaiq, between it and the Nafud which begins two hours from Jauf, is a clayey and pebbly tract called Safihah where Bedouins cut brushwood and dry grass for sale at Jauf. The Syrian road leaves Jauf by a defile in the Jal on the north-west-side of the valley. At the opposite end is the descent into the Jauf basin from the Hail side which occupies about half an hour. The symmetrical form of the Jauf depression is broken, on the west only, by a limestone spur which projects from the encircling heights and subsides by degrees into the centre of the plain. The soil of the valley is a sterile, crusty sand with clayey hollows here and there in which water collects, leaving salt behind when it dries ; rain however is rare-* Town. —The town forms a curve with the concavity to the south-west; for two- fifths of its length it runs from west-north-west to east-south-east and the remainder lies north-west and soutk-east. Its length is over 2 miles and its breadth less than half a mile, the latter being greatest near the point where the change occurs in the direction of its axis. The orchards and palm groves form a continuous line parallel to the town on its west side and mostly stand clear of it towards the western side of the valley, Jauf-al- 'Umr is divided into a number of quarters, each of which is separately walled, and con tains houses irregularly placed and interspersed with small orchards and with deep pits from which earth has been dug for building material. The houses are of sun-dried brick and many of them possess a detached coffee-room. The quarters,, in order from north-west to south-east are apparently Husaini, Gharbi, Dharai Qa'aiyid, Dirat Marid, Dlrat Hattab, Salman Habab, Sa'aidan, Kahaibiyln, T Alaq, Zuqmah, Khadhmah and Dalhamiyah. Dirat Marid is the most ancient quarter and to it belongs Marid castle, an erection originally all of hewn, stone but coarse in construction, which stands upon a precipice of the limestone spur already mentioned, is connected with the quarter by a wall, and looks north over the town. Dirat Hattab is the broadest part of the town and at Salman occurs the more southward bend previously described. Habab possesses a strong tower and was in former days at feud with the quarter of Dirat Marid. Dalhamiyah was destroyed in 1838 and has not been rebuilt. To these quarters may be added the village of Ghuti, a small walled * A sketch of the .] aiif oasis aiid bfisin is gme in Lfidy Anne Blunt's Pilgrimage (1.120). A good one was also made by Butler and Aylnaer, in 1908, ^JAUF-AL-'tBm 949 i city of hamlet of a dozen houses with a tower at each corner, which lies a few hundred yards to the east-south-east of Khadhmah. About half a mile south of Khadhmah, on rising ground, stands a large fort built by Ibn Rashid about 1867. It is about 90 yards long by 50 yards broad with walls 40 feet high and there is a tower considerably higher at each of the angles; it is furnished with loopholes and machicoulis. About 100 yards to the north-west of this fort is a copious spring which waters some date gardens. Inhabitants.—rYhQ population of Jauf-al-'Umr is estimated at about 3,000 souls. The inhabitants are Sahrarat, Hawazim (who are possibly Harb) and 'Aniz ah of the Ruwalah section ; also, it is said, some Bani Tamim, besides negroes and Mutawalladin. About a quarter of the fighting men of the town are armed with breech-loadin g rifles. The Jaufis are not naturally travellers, and those among them who are better off seldom leave the oasis unless to visit Hail or to make the pilgrimage to Mecca ; some of the poorer sort however go every year to the Syrian Hauran to labour for hire among the Druses. Cultivation and supplies. —-The resources of Jauf-al-'Umr are chiefly agricultural. The place is famous for its dates, which are unusually large and good, and particularly for a luscious and juicy sort called Hilwah ; in all some 15 varieties are grown. Wheat, barley, maize, millet and lucerne are cultivated in the date plantations, but the cereals are not raised in quantities equal to the local consumption. Fruits include figs, apricots, peaches, oranges and grapes ; a few vegetables also are grown. All the crops are irri gated from wells worked by bullocks travellers disagree as to the distance of the water from the surface, but it appears to be ordinarily 3 or 4 fathoms. The best wells for drinking purposes belong to the Khadhmah quarter. Besides wells, of which there are a large number, Jauf possesses half a dozen springs ; on the whole the water is good. The only cattle kept are those employed on the wells. There are practically no horses or camels, and transport, when required, is obtained from the surrounding Bedouins. Trade. —Jauf-al-'Umr is a market town for the Arab tribes of the country round, who bring in wool, hides, ghi, milk and occasionally ostrich feathers, and provide themselveif here, generally by way of barter, with dates and other provisions, gunpowder, calico of various sorts, 'abas, leather, and camel furniture. The Bedouins, as already remarked, are the carriers of Jauf, and the balance of food grain which the town requires is imported through them from abroad. A strange product of the desert which the Bedouins bring to Jauf for sale in large quantities is a wild grain called Samh; it resembles canary seed, has the colour of wheat, and can be made into bread. Travelling Syrians and occasionally Persians from Najaf visit Jauf and do business there. The artificers of Jauf have a great reputation throughout North-western Arabia for their work in metal and marble ; from the latter coffee-mortars and pestles are made. Light 'abas, spears, copper-ware, leather, camel-furniture and sandals are the other manufactures of the place. Administration. —About the year 1910, Jauf was retaken by Nuri Ibn Sha'alan, the principal shaikh of the Ruwala, in whose possession it still remains. Dependencies. —The following places, one of which is important, may most con veniently, as they lie in the vicinity of Jauf-al-'Umr and do not belong to any region which has a recognised name, be described here :— Name.

'' JAZIRAH— The Qadha of Jazirah is situated on the right bank of the Tigris to the south-west of Baghdad. It is bounded on the north by Saiyafiyah and Manari, opposite Taq Kisra ; on the east by the Tigris ; on the south by the tract of Ghubaishi, which divides it from the Bghailah Qadha, and on the west by the tract of Arqab Tahaiyar which separates it from the Qadha of Hillah. The headquarters of the Qadha is at Juwaimisah, which ^ also known as Suwairah. It is situated on the Tigris twelve hours' journey from x&gt;agliaad by road, and the same by river under favourable circumstances.951 JAZIEAH Tract.

The village of Hamidiyah, which is situated between the Tawil and Rajaibiyah tracts and was built by Shaikh Ajil as-Sumarmad with the permission of the Turkish Govern ment, was the seat of the Mudir, the Headquarters of the Nahiyah having been trans ferred from there to A'a'wij. All the tribes mentioned above come under the heading of Zubaid. They are cultiva tors and live by their crops and cattle. Owing to the injustice of the Government tax collectors, some have left the district and their lands have been left uncultivated. They are treacherous and unreliable and are past-masters in the use of fawning expres sions, especially the Bani 'Ajil. They are Shi'ahs by religion. They are armed with swords and lances, but not in large numbers, also with a few Martinis and other rifles of old pattern. Before the war they had about 850 Martini rifles, as shown in the following table, but little ammunition. The Turks in 1915-16 gave them more. Number Number Tribe. of of houses. rifles.

Position and boundaries. —The Qadha of Jazirah lies entirely on the right bank of the Tigris at a short distance belo v Baghdad City ; it is bounded on the north-east by the Tigris, which divides it on that side from the Qadha of 'AzizTyah. On the south east Jazirah meets the Qadha of Kut-al-Amarah; on the south-west that of Hillah in the Sanjaq of Dlwanlyah; and on the north-west that of Kadhimain. Topography and tribes. —The only places worthy of mention in the Qadha ara Suwairah, the administrative headquarters, and Bghailah ; both of these are der cribed in articles under their own names. It should be noted that the ordinary civil officials have little or no power in Bghailah and the Sanlyah properties attached to it, whioh may therefore be regarded as virtually excluded from the Qadha. 6o2r,o JAZ-JID 957 Tribe.

It possesses quays along the sea-front and is the port of Mecca (55 miles by road, and slightly under 50 crowfly) and Taif, and the main avenue of pilgrim access to Hejaz from the sea. The houses here, as at Yambo', are largely built of coralline. There are forts at the seaward angle of the walls, and three main gates and three postern (sea-face); elsewhere the wall is strengthened by smaller towers at intervals. The population is about 30,000 (not all inside the walls), and includes a moiety of negroes and Somalis, as well as some Indians, Greeks, and Jews ; about 300 British-Indian subjects are registered, but exact numbers of all families are not recorded. Sa'ad.JID—JIF 959 Kon-Moslems are not allowed to go outside the walls. The normal garrison is a battalion with two field guns. The Wali of Hejaz is here represented by a Qaimmakam. The wells in the town are brackish ; but good water is brought from rain-cisterns or from wells and springs 7 miles away. There is a water-condenser in the town which works irregularly, and its condensed water, being taken from a foul part of the harbour, often has a bad smell and taste ; it can turn out about 30 tons a day. The price at the condenser works out at about 85. §d. a ton, but as much aga n has to be paid for transport in the town in small quantities. On the quarantire island there is a smaller condenser, said to turn out about 15 tons a day, supplying certain-individuals and not the general public ; the price of its water works out at £1 I65. 8c?. per ton, including transport to shore. The price of good drinking-water from wells and springs varies down to about 10s. per ton, including transport; in 1912 it stood at the extraordinarily high rate of | about £1 a ton. At that time and for two years previously, there had been practically no rain-water from cisterns ; when there is any its price is geneally about I85. per ton, including transport. The bazaar (southern quarter) is well supplied. A petroleum engine for a flour mill, turning out about 18 cwt. of flour daily, was reported to have been set up and to be working in 1912 ; it is of British manufacture. A portable hospital, made of compressed paper and well equipped, was set up by the Turkish Government in 1911 outside the town for the accommodation of 100 pilgrims. The climate of Jiddah, though hot, is not un healthy, the sea-breeze counteracting to some extent the insanitary condition of streets and houses ; but mortality is high, and bubonic plague to some extent probably endemic.

JINNAH— Also called Jazirat-al-'Amair but this second name is ambiguous being borne by both Jinnah and Mussallamiyah islands. Jinnah is an island a mile off the coast of the San- jaq of Hasa near Musallamiyah bay ; it lies about 9 miles north-west of Abu 'Ali island and 3 miles south of Ras Bidya.' Jinnah is leve on the top of a light colour, and has cliffs 35 feet high on the north-east side; the western part of the island is low. The length, east and west, is about 1| miles ; and on its north-east side it is adjoined by a pearl bank known as Waih-al-Jazirah. On the north side is a mud house, occupied since 1902 by Turkish Dhabitiyah, at first 8 and now 3 in number, over which the Turkish flag is flown ; also a_village of about 100 families of the Bani Khalid tribe, belonging to the A1 Shahin, the A1 Hasan and perhaps to other 'Amair sections, who with the inhabitants of Musallamiyah island own about a dozen pearl boats. Access to the village for native boats is afforded by a channel coming from the direction of Ras Bidya' and there is a small basin with 3 fathoms of water close to the north-east of the island ; but the entrance of this basin, open to the eastwards, is nearly dry at low water. Jinnah island is under the Qaim-maqam of Qatif ; and the local Shaikh, who belongs to the A1 Shahin section of the Bani Khalid, has the title of Mudir and is paid an allwance of 30 Riyals a month by the Turks. JINNI (A l)— The first stage on the old dromedary post route that was used by the Hajj letter carriers between Madain Salih and Damascus before the Hejaz railway was opened.

JIRI— A small but somewhat singular plain in the Rasal Khaimah District of the Sharjah Principality in Trucial' Oman. Position and extent. —Jiri is shut in between a sandy desert on the west and the high hills of the 'Oman Promontory on the east, and it forms a connecting link between the plain of Sir and Dhaid which enclose it on the north and south respectively ; with these boundaries it is about 15 miles in length, from north to south, and 7 to 8 miles in breadth. At both ends it is contracted by an inclination of the western desert and the eastern hills towards each other, but in either case a passage into the next tract remains open. Physical characteristics. —The soil of Jiri is of a dark colour, forming a sharp contrast with the light red of the sandhills which border it upon the west; of this characteristic the detritus brought down from the hills on the east appears to be the explanation. The surface is generally sandy though firm ; but in places it is more clayey, retains water after rain, and cracks when it dries. Jiri is thickly sprinkled with acacias and other wild vegetation, and in the neighbourhood of the Hadaithah wells Samr and Ghaf trees are particularly abundant; hereabouts, too, the soil is more loamy than in some other parts and produces, after rain, a good deal of rank grass and weeds. Among the plants which grow towards the western edge of the plain are Rimth, Halam, Thamam and Qasad, all of which are useful as grazing, also dwarf tamarisk. The slope of the Jiri plain is towards the coast of the Persian Gulf, but the whole of the drainage is intercepted and utilized by the inhabitants. Inhabitants. —The only fixed villages are those of Khatt, Habhab and Adhan described in the table below, and the settled population, consisting of 'Awanat, Mazari, Naqbiyln, Sharqiyln and some Za'ab, hardly amounts to 1,000 souls. The predominant Bedouins of the district are Ghafalah and Na'im, the latter of the Khawatir section. Communications and water -supply. —Routes which cross Jiri are dealt with in the para graph on communications in the general article on Trucial Oman. The wells, some of which are mentioned in the paragraph on topography below, are generally about 60 feet deep and are worked with a bucket and rope arrangement, which limits their daily yield to about 1,200 gallons each ; but this amount they are capable of supplying, at least in the cold weather, and the water as a rule is of good quality. Administration. —Jiri is included in the dominions of the Shaikh of Sharjah and its government is in the hands of his Deputy Governor at Ras-al-Khaimah Town. Topography. —The following are the villages and other principal points of interest in Jiri:— Name. Adhan .. Position. At the head of Wadi Ham, of which it is often reckoned the highest up set tlement ; it is 10 miles south of Khatt and 14 miles north-east by north of Dhaid village.

A village of 35 houses of Sharqiyln. Two wells each about 10 fathoms deep and lined near their mouths with stone from the hills of the 'Oman Promontory. A couple of wells situated in a small green oasis. A village of 100 houses of 'Awanat, Naqbiyln and Sharqiyin. Some Za'ab from Jazirat al-Hamra sojourn here in the hot weather months for the date harvest. R emarks Habhab stands at the eastern foot of the hills of the 'Oman Promontory. It has a Falaj of its own, distinct from the source which waters Khatt. Animals are stated to be 30 donkeys, a few camels, 20 cattle and 250 sheep and goats, and date palms in number about 3,500. The wells are in the open plain, but they are surrounded by Ashkar shrubs and some fine Ghaf trees. They are used by nomads of the Gha- f alah tribe and of the Khawatir section of the Na'im. Good shade is afford ed by 4 or 5 sub stantial acacias near by. The tribes frequenting these wells are the same as at Hadai- thah. The date plantations form a large oasis and are said to con tain about 20,000 trees, of which ~ are owned by the Za'ab of JazTrat-al-Hamra. Livestock are esti mated at 20 camels, 30 donkeys, 25 cattle and 300 sheep and goats. Water for all purposes including irrigation is supplied by a hot spring, over looking which is a 6h2964 jm—jm Position. At the western edge of the Jiri plain, 5 miles south of Hadaithah.

JISRA (A bu)— A caravansarai, mid-way between Baghdad and Khanaqtn on the main route between Mesopotamia and Persia. The sarai at Abu Jisra will accommodate 200 men and horses, and there is plenty of camping space close by. The water-supply is from canals and is good but muddy. There are quantities of sheep and goats; grazing is good but luel is scarce. Supplies could be collected from neighbouring villages. Abu Jirsa is not a usual halting place for caravans which generally go right through from Ba qubah to Shahraban. JISSAH (Bandar)— An anchorage on the coast of the 'Oman Sultanate five miles south-east of Masqat iaw i n: ^ 18 for med by a precipitous light-coloured island, 600 yards long and 140 feet high WMich lies east and west across the entrance of a bay one mile in length and the same* m depth. The entrance round the east end of the island is 280 yards broad with a depth of 7 fathoms : the passage at the west end is nearly blocked by a flat rock which has only 1 2 fathoms on each side of it. The outline of the bay is indented, and there is an islet towards the western side behind which, on the mainland, is a village of 60 houses of Qawasim with a date grove: this village stands on a sandy beach at the mouth of a valley and consists of a few stone houses and many mat huts. Hills rise all round the harbour and at the back of the village to a height of some hundred feet. The harbour is sheltered except from the north-east and would afford anchorage in 6 to 7 fathoms for all classes of vessels except the largest: if proper moorings were laid down a fair number of ships could be accommodated at the same time. The bottom appears to be of sand throughout; there are a few detached rocks which could easily be removed. The site is naturally adapted for fortification. Fresh water is somewhat scarce. JISSAS— See 'Oman Sultanate; Ghafiri Tribes. JIZAH— See Hejaz Railway. JlZAH— A small village in Syria lying roughly mid-way between Dera'a, on the Hejaz Rail- way, and Bosra Eski Sham. Jizah is built on both sides of the valley, some 600 or 700 yards to the north of the road. JIZAL (Wadi)— A valley having its source in the southern highlands of the Hisma mountains It trends roughly south-east and joins Wadi Hamdh south of Madain Salih. In its upper reaches Wadi Jizal appears to be known as Wadi-al-Fara'. Doughty describes it as a plain bottom, with some growth of cane reeds, receiving the drainage of Jabal Jowla and Jabal Wuttid on the west and of the valleys and many breaches of Jabal 'Awairidh on the east. This upper valley bottom just below Wadi-al-Fara' ia called Wadi Najl (which receives the seyl waters from the Jau) and afterwards Wadi Najid. Wadi Najid descends from a two-headed sandstone mountain, Shorafat-an- Najid, and is crossed by the caravan route between Al-Wajj and Al-'Ali; it is two days966 JIZ-JIZ from the latter and in it they journey one day. Another valley descends from the west &lt;dde of the Shorafat to the seaward and is named also Wadi ^ajid. This passes Beda'and goes out atove Al-Wajj. After Wadi Najid there s,yl into the valley which descends from the Fara' (now Wadi Jizil) the deep watercourses of that harrah side Aurush, Dokhan, Tha, Gaila, in which are tent hamlets of Moahib husbandmen. The valley receives upon the other hand the scyl waters commg down from the wadis of the Harairi; of which certain, as Wadi Jaidah, are palm valleys and husbanded by Billi Bedouins.— [Doughty.) JIZAN— A small seaport town on the 'Asir coast of the Red Sea, about 200 miles south of Qunfi- dah and opposite the Farasan Islands. It is the Idrisi's chief outlet on the sea, the other beino Mcdi (Maidi, Midi). There is a small bazaar and fresh meat and vegetables are obtainable at a day's notice. Water is scarce ; the supply comes from Hafa ir, a village one hour to the eastward, at the junction of Wadi Dhamad and Wadi Jizan. There is a so-called fort here. , , ^ .. . „ The Farasan Islands, opposite to Jizan, once coveted by Germany as a coaling station, are now occupied by a British garrison. JIZI (W adi-al)— A valley in the Western Hajar district of the Sultanate of 'Oman which, rising in a locality 30 miles east by south of the Baraimi Oasis, reaches the sea immediately to the north of Sallan in Batinah: its length is thus between 35 and 40 miles in a straight line, and its general direction is from west-south-west to oast-north-east. Wadi-al-Jizi is apprently formed by the confluence of two other valleys, viz., Wadi Abailah from the north-west and Wadi Kitnah from the south-west; between these two iust before their junction, is a level expance several square miles in area known as the Abailah plain. Wadi Abailah has its head in a larger plain named Hawaithah and a well-marked ridge of hills runs parallel to it at a short distance from its left bank. The valley contains the villages of Subaithah and Kabaidah on its left bank, at 4 and 7 miles respectively above its junction with Wadi Kitnah; and 5 miles north-west of Kabaidah is another village, Zahar, on the westren border of the Hawaithah plain. These are villages of the Bani Ka'ab tribe, mostly of the Nawaijiyln section.

Nil Here are the graves of many 'Omanis slain in resisting an advance of the Wah- habis upon Sohar Town early in the 19 th century. Just below Khan is a tower called Burj- ash-Shikairi on a peak 200 feet high on the right bank of the wddi; it is joined by a stone wall to a tower lower down and is said to have been construct ed as a defence against the Wahha- bis. It is occupied by a garrison of 10 men on behalf of the Sultan of 'Oman, Nil Just below Milaiyi nah is an ancient arched aqueduct of masonry which conveys water to Gharraq. Nil Picturesquely situated on the top of a hill. This place really lies some distance to the north of WMi-al- Jizi.968 JOA-JOZ At each village there are a few hundred date palms and everywhere wheat, barley millet and lucerne are grown. Animals are not very numerous; there are few camels and some donkeys, besides goats and sheep. The above are the principal villages in the main valley, and the chief tributary valleys with their villages are; Wadi Hail 'Adha, from the north between Wasit and Khan, with a village Hail 'Adha composed of 40 houses of Maqabil and Shabul; Wadi Hansi from the south-west about midway between Khan and Sahailah, having a village Hansi with 40 houses of Shabul and Maqabil, and another Furfar with 15 houses of Shabul on its left bank at 3 and 7 miles respectively from its mouth ; Wadi Thiqbah, from the north, coming in exactly opposite Wadi Hansi and containing the village of Hail-ash- Shiya, 10 houses of Kunud, Hail-ar-Rafsah, 60 houses of Kunud, and Thiqbah, 20 houses of Kunud ; the village of Thiqbah is on the left bank of the Wadi of the same name at a little more than a mile from Wadi-al-Jizi. The settled population of the entire valley with its tributaries seems to be about 4,000 souls. Wadi-al-Jizi runs in the hills until a short distance below Milaiyinah, when it leaves them and enters the Batinah plain. On its way across Batinah to the coast Wadi-al- Jizi is said to pass on both sides of the Hurah Barghah hill. From Hail down to Sihlat the valley contains flowing water; above Khawairij the stream is copious though never more than a few inches deep ; below Khawairij it dis appears and reappears at intervals. The fields are irrigated both by wells and by conduits from the stream. The route from Sohar Town to the Baraimi Oasis lies up Wadi-al-Jizi and over the 'Abailah plain ; it is reported to be easy and not to present any obstacle which need j delay field artillery more than an hour. Travellers leave Sohar by Sallan, whence they pass by 'Auhi and Falaj-al-Qabail to Falaj-as-Suq ; 2 or 3 miles beyond Falaj-as-Suq they strike Wadi-al-Jizi, which they follow for 4 miles and then again leave, diverging to the right for 9 miles ; rejoining the wddi at Sahailah they follow it with little deviation to its head ; the further way lies across the 'Abailah and Hawaithah plains, and then by Kharus and between Khatmat Shiklah and Khatmat Suwwad, which are described in the article on the Jau district.

The Gazetteer is alphabetically-arranged and this volume contains entries A through to J.The Gazetteer is an alphabetically-arranged compendium of the tribes, clans and geographical features (including towns, villages, lakes, mountains and wells) of Arabia that is contained within three seperate bound volumes. The entries range from short descriptions of one or two sentences to longer entries of several pages for places such as Iraq and Yemen.A brief introduction states that the gazetteer was originally intended to deal with the whole of Arabia, "south of a line drawn from the head of the Gulf of 'Aqabah, through Ma'an, to Abu Kamal on the Euphrates, and to include Baghdad and Basrah Wilayats" and notes that before the gazetteer could be completed its publication was postponed and that therefore the three volumes that now form this file simply contain "as much of the MSS. [manuscript] as was ready at the time". It further notes that the contents have not been checked.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023486087.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
