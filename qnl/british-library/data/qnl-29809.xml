Trevor, C.I.E., Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the correspondence ending nrith telegram No. 1084-S., dated the 26th October 1915, from Foreign to Sir Percy Cox, and No. 207, dated 9th November 1915, from this Office to Foreign, on the subject of tho Imam’s rising, I have the honour to inform you that I was about to address you regarding the situation in Oman when His Highness the Sultan himself approached me on the subject. He pointed out that the Imam, whose strength Inis increased steadily, has now, for four years, held Oman and was at the present minute attacking llustaq. If this were taken it would again greatly strengthen the Imam’s prestige and the Sultan evidently fears for the future. He admitted to me that, if it were not for the vulnerable position of the tribes on the coast, many of them would join the Imam and be bad few tribes left upon whom lie could rely, a number which decreases as the Imam’s strength increases and defections have taken place in the past year. He was anxious then to make a move on the Wadi Samail after the hbt w'eather when be was of the opinion he could raise from 2,000 to 3,000 men from the Sobar District, and he wished to know if we would assist him. I asked him if he could not do this alone with the tribes he was mentioning as still loyal. He replied that he thought he could do so, but if we would help him the cost woulfl be one twentieth of the amount it would take if he were to do it alone. This is an euphemism : in actual fact I do not think he could do anything alone. His present movement to the assistance of liustaq will be a test of this. The reports received regarding Government of the Imam show that justice is obtainable and the only complaints heard are due to the fact that it is strict and that debtiOrs are made to pay their debts, which is not always popular, and I have no doubt that the strong fanatical tendency must he a strain upon many who miss the tobacco and other luxuries of which they are not allowed to make use but, I no longer hear any suggestion of the break up of the solidity of the revolutionary party. The leading Hindu merchants have told me that all their debts referred to the Imam w r ere paid immediately, that they had no outstandings due to their firms at Barkab, &amp;e., who dealt direct with the interior, and that it was only where the Sultan held sway that chaos reigned and claims were unsettled. The Hindu community inform me that the Government of the Imam is good and that, if the rule of the Walis in the districts was not good, it was at any rate very much better than the condition of affairs at Maskat and Mattrah under the ^Ultan himself. On the other hahd I have never heard a good word from any one regard ing the Government jof the Sultan or his Walis. His courts are venal, justice is not given or to be bbtained, cases are not attended to and everything is chaos2 from a financial point of view. If lie bad no extra t liquidate.

TliP revolution for such it is, is no spasmodic movement which has suddenly sprung up. It is the definite polled of 50 ^ars with continuous historical sequence. . It would be imiiossible within the pages of this report to give the whole historv of this movement since to do so would fill a smal. pamp lie , u nno e sufri ienCy to show that the policy has never wavered and that it is founded upon the customs of the country and the tenets of its religion.. I will however, preface my remarks by saying that, notwithstanding this, owing to the fact that its tendency is retrograde and fanatica , and that its system would not give equal justice to all creeds, it would be impossible to suonmt the rebels as rivals to the Sultan while the very demands made by them show how hopeless it would be to consider their claims. I would desire merelv to show that force, applied without conciliation, would only res 1 in a continuance of past history and that outbreaks would continue regularly as in ^I'he noliev of the revolutionary leaders is one that must command some sympathy sinJe its aim is patriotic, even if mistaken, and their desire is to be ruled accordin'’ to the laws of their religion and to avoid foreign influence ; k is the irony of fate that the action which they take to prevent tins last tends to make it the only solution of the difficulty. The sect to which they belong is the Ibadhi, and one of the chief dogmas of their faith is that an Imamate is not a necessity Imt that, when circum stances arise which demand its existence, the dignity is elective and not 1,6 For most of its existence Oman has been ruled by Imams but, during the last centuryj few of the rulers have had the necessary religious qualifications to fill the post. / It may be noted in passing that the name of Sultan is of British manu- f^tnre and is practically unknown among Oman subjects, who invariably know and refer to tbeir ruler as “ the Saiyid ”, the members of his family and Us branches being known as “Saiyid”. We have always admitted the fact that the Sultanate is not a hereditary v„t an elective dignity, and indeed, until the accession of the present Sultan, ^ ivid T- imur we have assured ourselves of the fact that the ruler Was accept able to his people before according him recoguitxon. On the accession of the present ruler our hands were forced for we had a 1 ready committed ourselves beforehand to the assistance of Saiyid Faisal, his father against whom the tribes had risen and thus we could not do otherwise than continue that support to his representative who took over the reins of 1 have referred to the historical sequence of this revolution, and I trust that the following account will show the correctness of this statement. In 1868, Azzan bin Qais, a member of the Rustaq branch of the ruling i Yiilv the Al bu Said, to which all Sultans since 1741 have belonged, seized the throne from the parricide Sultan Salim. Azzan’s two chief supporters were Salih bin Ali el Harithi and Said bin K half an el Khalili. The chief leader and instigator oi the present rising k th &gt; son of the former, Isa, and an important member i.| the son of the latter.Azzan was declared Imam and, for bis short reign, ruled well, if too firmly, for the taste of the inhabitants of Maskat and Mattrah. The Gazetteer states &lt;{ such leadership and many resolutions as his had not been witnessed at Maskat since the days of Sultan bin Ahmednoor had he been approached by either of his immediate predecessors in energy or deter mination to rule. lie had many disadvantages to contend against, not the least being the character of the associates by whom he was carried into power and the dissensions that prevailed among them, but as his authority became consolidated the influence of religious fanaticism in his councils declined But for the refusal of British recognition the consequent loss of the Zanzibar subsidy and the release, by the British Government, of his most dangerous rival, Turki, it is possible that Azzan might nevertheless have surmounted all his difficulties and reduced Oman, for a time at least, to the cmblance of a well ordered monarchy.” Turki, however, succeeded in wresting the power from Azzan who was killed in the struggle. The two great factions of Oman are the Hinawi and the Ghafiri and it was to the latter section that Turki owed his success. It may be noted that to one or the other of these two factions belong all the tribes of Oman. The Binawi have been responsible for all risings in the past and it is the fact that the present insurrection represents the whole of the interior of Oman and not only the Hinawi section which marks it as being different from those which have previously occurred. To resume: Mislead by a report of the death of Turki, in 1874, Salih bin Ali made a bid to place the son of Azzan on the throne; arrangements were made by the British Government to support Turki bm the latter bought off his enemies. Among those who joined the rebellion was the Chief of Kustaq who, the following year, seized the port of Masnaah but was shelled out of it bv H. M. S. “Philomel”. In 1875 Turki found himself unable to cope with the situation with which he was faced and fled to G wadar leaving his capable brother, Abdul Aziz, as his Viceroy to put matters right for him, with the assistance of Salih. At the end of the year, when things were going better, Turki returned without giving notice to his brother and seized some of the forts, treating as an enemy the brother who had done so much for him, with the result that, hence forward, we find Abdul Aziz in the ranks of his opponents. Various rebellions took place during the next few years which are not worthy of remark, but, in 1883, we find Salih bin Ali once more preparing for a supreme effort to depose 1 urki. Though he put forward prominently the name of Abdul Aziz, the brother of the fcultan, it appears to have been his intention to place liamud bin Baisal, a religious recluse, in the seat of authority. The Political Agent was given due warning and was requested to move British subjects to a place of safety. As the Sultan was doubtful of his ability to defend Maskat once more, British help was given to him and 11. M. S. “ Philomel ” assisted the defence with artillery fire with the result that the rebel movement was broken up. In 1886 an explicit announcement was made to the Chiefs of Oman that we would not permit attacks upon the towns of Maskat and Mattrah, and that we would, if necessary, expel the rebels if they occupied them and would replace feaivid Turki. -O' This was a personal guarantee to Saiyid Turki and not applicable to his successors. I would point out in passing that such a restriction, though it sounds well on paper, is, in practice or indeed on analysis, of no value. Taking into consi deration the circumstances in Oman, a guarantee of this nature once given must be continued to a successor, if he is to maintain bis place, for the withdrawal of the support is practically an encouragement to attack.4 H,. \ His adherents seized the gates o£ the J d g i5 , id F a i sa l himself confederates.

The lootin' 1 which subsequently took place was started by the leviesflf the Sultan and not’by those of the rebels though, when the latter found at y Mere to withdraw, they did much wanton damage.

In the same vear Isa bin Salih wrote a threatening letter to the Sultan relating to the manumission of slaves. . , T n 1908 he continued the policy of his father his intention being, accord- in. to the Gazetteer, “ (o revive the obsolete &gt; dignity of the Imamate to confer it upon Said and then to govern m his name • P The movement did not assume great proport,ons ^ Said did not receive general support, but U. Ai. b. . bpmnx someumo Ip j / L) ^45 * carrying tlie Political Agent visited from time to time the ports of the Batineh coast and courteous letters were received from Isa bin Salih promising protec tion to British subjects. In 1905 Isa made overtures for reconciliation to the Sultan, which were well received, but finally fell through owing to mutual distrust, which was probably well founded. Isa, however, despatched one of his retainers, a well known Mutawwa priest, by name Abdullah bin Humaid es Salami, to visit the Sultan. Kote may be made of this name as it has a bearing on current events. In 1906 there was trouble with the Bani Biyam, an influential tribe of the Gbafiri faction, which was not settled till 1908 and this would also appear to have been an important factor. In the same year private reports were received that Isa proposed once more to attempt to establish an Imamate but, though nothing came of it, the rumour was probably correct. In 1912, after the establishment of the Arms Warehouse, rumours were constantly arriving of a pending universal rising of the Bedouins on account of the restriction in arms traffic, and the Sultan received a strong and threaten ing letter from Sheikh Isa on the subject, but the files reveal no further reference to the matter until the rising actually broke out in May 1913. Sheikh Abdullah bin Humaid es Salami, Isa’s enemy of 1906, the chief Mulla of the Ibadhi sect and who was also the religious tutor to the sons of Isa, appeared as the leader of the new rising and he appointed as Imam his deciple and son-in-law Salim bin Rashid el Kbarusi, Isa did not openly join the rebellion immediately. It was joined by Hamyar bin Nash* el JSebhani, Tamimeh of Tanuf and chief Sheikh of the Riyami tribe of Ghafiris. Es Salami went about raising the tribes and Ghafiris and Hinawis alike declared their allegiance but the main body of the latter faction only came in 'when Isa bin Salih openly attached himself to the movement. From previous history and the subsequent direction of the rebellion there is little doubt that Isa was, and lias been, the bidden power behind the scenes from the commencement and the Sultan confirms this as being correct. He was however clever enough to sec where previous revolutions had failed and to perceive the wisdom of bringing in the Ghafiris first in order to make the movement a uuiversal one in Oman. From the above it will be seen that, though the arms traffic was the tool which w T as finally used to weld together tumultuous and turbulent tribes, the policy of the deposing of the line of Turki and the reversion to an Imam bad been a consistent and continuous one with the leaders of the Sharkiyeh dis trict, a policy of which they had lost sight, and which has now reached a successful issue. My object in giving the above history is to show that it will not be possible to suppress an ideal which has existed for so many years by a simple effort of force any more than it has proved possible in Ireland. We must, if colled upon to use force, accompany it with conciliation and allow such portion of their demands as are reasonable, notably the demand for justice, which, as has been shown, has every foundation. To assist by force in imposing upon them a worse government than that which they now have constituted would be a policy with which we could not associate ourselves. Conciliation is the more necessary since, from the point of view of their history and their religion, right is on their side: while it would be difficult to-day to deny the right of a people to depose its ruler if he rules badly. It will then be well to see what grounds for complaint the tribes have against the dynasty which they have so disliked. I will quote from the Gazetteer. In the period up to 1875 when he fled to Gwadar “ the ill success of Turki as a ruler was a severe disappointment to many, including the British authorities by whom bis accession bad been regarded with complacency.” “ The Sultan, though feeble in character and sometimes treacherous in conduct, was of a mild and liberal disposition and bis^death was felt to be a misfortune for Oman“ The Sultan’s authority at a distance from his capital was everywhere, ‘ even at the close of his reign, either nominal or precarious in short he was a weak but not an evil ruler.” These are the indulgent criticisms passed by British officers on one whom they liked personally and who, during the concluding years of his reign, enjoyed a reputation with them for sound judgment in tribal affairs and for skill in the management of his Arab subjects; but they would hardly be borne out by the tribes under him to whom a weak ruler is an evil ruler and whose country away from the capital was in one constant state of strife and turmoil with no one krong enough to give justice or hear complaints. His loyalty in slave trade'matters “tended to make him unpopular with certain classes of hjs subjects ” and “ may thus have been one cause of his extreme dependence on British support”. This would also tend to explain his friendly relations with ourselves. Of Saiyid Faisal the first reports, 1888 to 1894, are “ in fact his policy from carelessness rather than from incapacity was apathetic, and it estranged from him even the best disposed tribes.” “ Bis efforts during the next few years to extend his direct authority or to recover it where lost, were all equally unfortunate.” “ The valuable support of Salih bin Ali was retained by the Sultan only till 1891, when he alienated it by showing favour to Said bin Ali, a rival Sheikh of the Hirth, and the catastrophe thereafter was not long delayed.” “ The Sultan between 1888 and 1894 ployed, on the whole, a less conspicuous and successful part in reconciling tribal differences than hia subject Salih bin Ali, or the quasi-rebel Ibrahim bin Qaais, chief of Rustaq. « At length, in the beginning of May 1911, at the invitation of Salih bin Ali, the Sultan, who bad shown a reprehensible apathy in the matter, intervened.” In 1895, after the rebellion, the British Government extended to Saiyrd Faisal the guarantee given to his father that they would not allow attacks to be made upon Maskat or Mattrah whatever differences the Sultan might have with his tribes, and a Notification to that eilect was given to the chiefs of the tribes in Oman. It may be noted that, although we have on each occasion made reference to the ports of Maskat and Mattrah alone, we have in actual fact extended the principle throughout to all the ports of the Batineh coast and also to Kuryat, at which are resident British subjects, thus maintaining for the Sultan his control of the entire coast line from Kuryat northwards. Faisal’s administration later made some improvement and he obtained possession of various places notably Nizwah in the interior. On his death, in 1913, Major Knox, the Political Agent of the time, wrote of him “He was undoubtedly a weak ruler but lus pleasant genial manners and accessibility won him some popularity ** “ the natural result in a place like Maskat was chaos in the administration.” The natural order of things in the history of uncivilised or semi-civilised countries whether European or Oriental is for weak dynasties of this nature to be overcome by some more virile line which arises. In Maskat this tendency would be even stronger for rulers living perma nently in the enervating climate of the coast where the inhabitants decline in physique and in energy must, in the course of time, be overcome by the tribes of a more temperate climate while, being practically absentee landlords, they are bound, unless they take steps to combat it, to lose touch with the tribes men who should support them. This natural course of events then has been stopped by our intervention owing to our political necessities. It is not surprising that those whom we have° thwarted should have some feeling against us and fear our ultimate motives in keeping upon the throne a line of rulers whom they despise the more so since they have now shown that they can rule themselves very much better than the weak and pleasant sovereigns whom we have supported.The situation then is this : 'We hnve, in Oman opposed to each other a nominal ruler whose existence depends almost entirely upon our good-will, and a vii’ile but uncivilised and fanatical Government which we cannot support. Our problem is to make these warring elements coalesce. It had been determined to leave the solution of the difficulty till the end of the war but that looked for period appears still far off and, in the meantime, the situation is going from bad to worse. The Imam has been in possession now for four years and, as time pro gresses, his position gets stronger and defections from the Sultan’s cause con tinue till the latter does not know upon whom he can depend. His financial position gets worse and worse, his debts increase and he has not the money with which to purchase the support which he requires. The subteriuges to which he has to descend to obtain money for his ordinary household expenses are humiliating and the little respect in which he is held is weakened by the sight of the Sultan’s cheques being hawked about the bazaar in the hope of some one producing some money for him. We cannot leave Maskat to find its own salvation in its own wav owing to its position athwart the main route to Baghdad, Basrah and the Persian Gulf. Our policy has been hound up with the place for more than a century and it cannot be allowed to tall into the hands of any one who might be even unfriendly. We are accordingly tied here by our interests, and there is no course open to us but to continue to support the Sultan in the present juncture. It only remains to consider what should be the nature and form of that support, in giving which we assume a great moral responsibility. It will be our duty to remove all legitimate cause for complaint which may exist and to see that the country has a government which is just, equitable and firm. I lie Sultan is already aware that, without our assistance, his permanent rule is impossible. It remains for us to impress upon Hie tribes that, without our approval, their very existance is a matter of difficulty, but it is evident that, whatever decision may be arrived at as to our future action, whether that action be of a peaceful or forcible nature, we shall of necessity ultimately be responsible that peace conditions are maintained. Such being the case and whatever the amount of interference we may be compelled to make, our freedom of action will be fettered by the French Agreement of 1862 and it would appear that now is the moment ‘to get that Agreement rescinded. French interest in Maskat in recent years is due to the French and Russian combination of some 30 years ago, which was made with the object of diminishing British influence in the Fersian Gulf. To-day France has one subject in Maska* and but little interest in Oman beyond the 12 dhows which still fly the French flag. With our position at Basrah and Baghdad and the events of the war the * French must have changed their ideas in this reference. It is true that, in September 1913, we confirmed to the French Government our intention to conform to the treaty but that was before the war since when circumstances have altered: Tve could now well point out that, for the security of our posi tion at Basrah, we must have control of the situation at Maskat. I have already suggested that local requirements demand immediate action. The two ruling factors in this are firstly, the indebtedness of the Sultan and his family and the inaptitude and the administration. Ihe financial condition of the Sultan has already been mentioned and his brothers, uncles and the female members of his family are in no better state Many of their debts become a burden on the Customs upon which their various allowances are already a tax, while I have a long list of claims against them, and even against His Highness pending in my court, claims which are put oil from day to day aud remain unsettled. Indeed they cannot be settled.8 The Customs is drawn against in advance and has to borrow monev to carry on Most of the merchants have large debts standing against it which are worked on the system of deposits. Instead of paying full customs dues for floods imijorted they pay half dues, the other half being credited agams the debt. I have iust had in my court a long case connected with the accounts of a Hindu firm in its dealings with the Customs Department. The case which I have purposely investigated in great detail shews a most woeful system of fraud and of wasteful methods. Though the new Superintendent of Customs has I believe, improved matters much, His Highness receives only a tithe of what would be obtained if the customs at all the ports were under proper supervision. Before going into the question of his administration it may he well here to consider the character of His Highness Saiyid Taimur. I find a note on this subject, left by my predecessor which reads as follows “ weak, amiable and ineffective, has some of the instincts of a gentleman and very good manners when he acts unjustly or unreason ably be is probably moved by (1) pique, (2) desire to flaunt an unreal independence, (3) a tendency towards ultra-religion, or most commonly indebtedness. His financial position is desperate . lo this I should add that His Highness has many good qualities. He has sound common-sense and is liberal minded and has a desire to improve matters. He is undoubtedly in favour of progress and would prefer justice to injustice if he could achieve it; he has not however the means at his disposal, nor has he the necessary knowledge to acquire the required organisation. He has even a tendency towards science but has not the education to follow it. To sum up as the ruler of the tribes of Oman he is hopeless, as the ruler of a State under European tutelage, I am of opinion, that he would acquire merit. As matters stand his administration is as hopeless as his finance. No courts exist worthy of the name and his Kazis are corrupt, his courtiers are venal and useless and his brothers may be summed up in the same terms. It is the advice of those around him which causes him to do unwise things and it is they I think, who tear, more than he does, the corrective of our influence. He has accordingly no one to whom he can turn to improve matters. Eor many years his father fought the desire of the Government of India to manage the Customs for him, fearing the disappearance of the last vestage of his independence. This feeling Saiyid Taimur has to a certain degree inherited. The conditions, however, are such that, if not amended, the Sultan s financial conditions must soon land him in bankruptcy and his administration, or the want of it makes him more and more disliked as a ruler. In order to terminate the present state of affairs, it is necessary to make the one side see that reform of Government is necessary and the other side realise that submission to the ruler is the only course possible and that it is inevitable. I have said that the Sultan knows that without our assistance bis position is impossible. Not only does he know it but all the world of Maskat and Oman as well, it should not then be difficult to get him to agree to reason able terms. There remain the tribes to he dealt with and it is evident that argument will need to be backed by force before they will give up their present advantageous position. We have however to our hand a weapon which will not require the use of a single soldier. The life of Oman depends upon the external world. The rice and the grain it imports, the clothes it wears and the wood from which it makes its boats are imported from India, while the dates, pomegranates and limes it pxports uic sold to British subjects and despatched to Butish poits.It would only be necessary to declare a blockade, a blockade which would Hot need a ship to enforce it, beyond the Sultan's own vessel, to bring the tribes to their senses. I now come to the main point of my letter. To hope to keep the tribes to any agreement they might make and to make the Sultan improve his government, British influence would be necessary, and this can only be obtained by some form of Protectorate or permanent trea ty. It is doubtful whether any oriental country can rule itself. The state ment which we recently made to the United States of America with reference to Turkey in Europe is equally true of all oriental states in Asia. They are tuifit and unable to govern themselves in contact with European Powers. The present status of Maskat is not that of an independent kingdom and, in 1S90, the Government of India, in raising the question of the possibility of a protectorate, pointed out to the India Office the existence of a virtual protec torate over Oman at the time. On the other hand, if it is not desired to establish a protectorate over an Arab kingdom at the present juncture, a permanent treaty or perhaps one for a fixed term of years could be made under which the Sultan should agree to employ certain British officials to supervise his judiciary, his customs and his army, such being made the condition of our further support of him. The blockade which I have suggested would be an easy matter to arrange and, even though some leakage might occur, would have the desired effect. By consenting to the Sultan publishing a “trading with the enemy' notice and by supporting it with our Customs services in India hardly a grain of rice could be imported by the Oman ports or a date exported. It would no doubt be possible to enforce this on the Trucial coast also bv means of our influence there, by checking exports by means of our Customs in India and by demanding a certificate of interest for all dates imported into Bombay, Karachi, Kutch, &amp;c. The Sultan would be able to seize all dates brought into his ports if they were not protected by purchase by British subjects. Before, however, proceeding to these measures, I would suggest that I should be allowed to ask for an interview with the rebel leader Isa bin Salih el Hadthi. The last meeting with Lieutenant-Colonel Benn, in 1915, did not yield much result, but it took place too soon after the fight, in January, with which Colonel Benn’s name was associated and was conducted without any idea of our intervention. To-day I am hopeful that such a meeting with the sympathetic and con ciliatory hearing to the other side, while holding over them the weapon of a blockade if they were unreasonable, would produce good results and wouid certainly be worth a trial to put an end to the present intolerable position. Our practical intervention is not only necessary from our own point of view but also from that of the Sultan himself, though he may not realise it. I have always observed, and it is a point to which I do not think we give* sufficient weight in our policy and dealings with Arab Shaikhs, &amp;c., that tfife- more the ruler comes under our influence, and rules according to our ideas the further he gets from his own uneducated tribes and the less they desire him. Once a Sheikh comes under our influence there is no alternative to our ultimate protection of him if he is to keep his position. The nearer he grows to us the further he grows from his own people until they realise the benefits of good government. It may sound a contradiction to say that British intervention would put an end to the fear of foreign influence but, in the East, many contradictions are true and from what I gather British intervention would not be unpopular10 ■I except, perhaps, with the extreme puritanical party. The feeling against -he British is due to their support of the Sultan and they hate the Sultan rather than the British. The meeting held by Lieutenant-Colonel Benn and Shaikh Isa in 1915 forms a useful basis to examine on what lines peace could be made, and I would invite a reference to his letter No. 189, dated 28th September 1915. In appendices C and D attached thereto will be found a comparative state ment of the demands of the Sultan and the rebels and the answers thereto. The answers of both sides are bombastic and unbending and would continue to be so unless British influence were brought to bear. The main stumbling block is the Wadi Semail and, notw ithstanding the fact that Shaikh Isa stated that it was the Imam who would not give way on this point, there is little doubt that it was Shaikh Isa himself who is the cause of the difficulty. You will be aware of the importance of the Wadi Semail to . Oman politics, it cuts Oman in two and is the key to the country and thus must remain in the immediate possession of the Sultan. The history of the country which I have given shows that, for the last fifty years, the'Sultans of Oman have had little control over the interior except at times over Nizwah and Izki, and unless Saiyid Taimur were very much strengthened he could not hope to rule over Oman proper except by himself living there among the tribes. (It is the fact that the Sultans of Oman have left their proper place in the interior which has caused them to lose touch with their tribes and so produced the feeling of hostility to them.) The Sultan could not, however, for the moment, return to the interior and it would, therefore, be necessary for him to nominate a Governor in his name. There is no reason why Isa, w ho is an able man, should not be bribed by making him that Governor. It w'ould at any rate be worth trying. The chief stumbling block to peace is the existence of the Imam, but Isa is the man behind the throne and should be able to evolve a system by which the Imam could be given reljgious sway while he himself ruled in temporal matters. The suggestion of the Imam as the Sultan’s deputy was made and negatived immediately, as w r as to he expected. The Sultans own opinion is that as long as the Imam is alive he will be recognised by the tribes but a discredited Imam with Isa detached would be a very different thing. Former movements have all collapsed directly the el Harithi chief of the moment was not in touch with them. With reference to the details of appendices C and 1) of the letter above referred to I think 1 have written enough to show that the claims of the rebels to justice and better government are not without foundation and so 1 will not deal with such items which contain these demands; the replies of the Sultan may, for a similar reason, be neglected. The first demand in appendix C to be noted is No. 5. If Shaikh Isa or some other person represented the Sultan this demand Would disappear. Demand No. 6 for allowances might most distinctly be accommodated in return for good behaviour. Demand No. 7 refers to a trained corps. This would be explained to them as being under British officers and a guarantee lor the good behaviour of ail parties. • Demand No, 9 refers to the slave trade and I am dealing with this in a letter which I propose should be issued to the chiefs as mentioned later. No. 10 release of prisoners would follow if meeting were not abortive. No. 11 disputes to be settled by Muhammadan law is already agreed to. No. 12 prohibition of sale of wine on tap should I think be agreed to. No. 13 is already agreed to. iSo. 14. would come under the new proposed ^arrangement of Customs. 1 now come to the demands of the bultan himself.11 / ; , I ■' (1) Subordination to Sultan of Imam. This mi'ht be arranged on the lines of the Pope and the Catholic sovereigns of the middle ages. And this point could be settled in communication with Isa bin Salih whose previous answer was obviously bluff. (2) Surrender of Semail. This has already been dealt with. Must ho surrendered to the Sultan. Isa is the objector. I have I trust given enough to show that, given the show of British intervention behind to make peace permanent, we have enough to go to a meeting. I now come to the question of the necessity for a trained corps and I propose to deal with this in a separate letter. At the present moment it would be difficult to spare odicers to train a levy corps, but one officer would be sufficient. I am, however, despatching this letter since the necessity for a decision regarding the question of a meeting with the rebel leaders and, if necessary, a blockade is rendered urgent by the ’fact that the date season will be in full sway in two months before which time the meeting should take place. If a meeting were agreed to I would suggest the despatch beforehand of a letter to all the Chiefs of Oman on the lines of the attached draft which has been written to appeal to the Oriental rather than to the European. A copy of this letter has been sent direct to the Hon’ble the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Dapart- ment. Sub-Enclosure of Enclosure to Serial No. 5. Text of proposed letter to Imam and leaders of revolution and all Chiefs of tribes. I have read with interest the correspondence regarding the meeting of the Political Agent, Lieutenant-Colonel Benn, with Sheikh Isa bin Salin iu 1915'and the letters which you addressed to that officer. In one of the letters which was written by Abdullah bin Hashid bin Salih al Hasmi Kazi and Sheikh Hamed bin Said al Faleti you make many complaints and I Mould wish to discuss some of these with you. You raise the question of the manumission of slaves and complain that we have no right to do this, but by your own Shara a man who is born a Muhammadan cannot beheld as a slave and every man can free a slave so found. As to slaves brought from other countries that is against our law and the law of the countries from which such men were being brought and you surely would not think we should follow your law out of your country in opposition to the law of those countries. AU civilised countries of the world, including the Muhammadan countries of Turkey and Persia, have forbidden slavery. Would you enforce an unlaw ful rule upon others. This is impossible. With regard to the rifles and ammunition. This also is the system of all civilised countries of the world that only the Nizam or those having a license from the Government of the country snould possess rifles and do you want Muhammadans to slay each other in defiance of the law. If not then you should order that rifles be taken away from ail men so that disputes may be finished by law and not by the recourse to arms, for this is against the Muham madan law as well as all laws. And the British Government is a friend of the Muhammadans and especially the Arabs and is assisting the Arab Muhammadans in all parts of the world, a fact which must be known to you. How then should we wish evil to a Muhammadan nation. Our friend Taimur is a good Muhammadan and is willing to govern accord- in' to Shara in all things possible. You complain that we have interfered with the appointing and deposing of your sovereigns but Taimur is onr friend and why should we not assist him. II 1 »&gt; 12 Is there no such thing as friendship and alliance in this world. But you talk as though you were a kingdom apart from the world. In this world in all transactions there must be give and take. You say that you will do this and you will do that and these are your conditions. This is no time for such talk. The world is grown up and we are not children. You say that these are your customs and these are your conditions. If you wish to trade with a man you must think of his conditions also. From whom do you get your rice and your clothing and the flour you eat, from where does the wood come from which you make your boats and, where do you sell your dates and your pomegranates and limes. And if you speak like this to us why should we allow our subjects to deal with you. Why should we not forbid them to sell you rice and clothes and to buy your dates, pomegranates and limes. So let us discuss this question not like enemies or children but like men and friends. You talk of innovations but rifles and ammunition are innovations and, if we do not supply you, you can make them yourselves ; but this would be an innovation and the machinery for making cloth is an innovation ; but vou say what you wish and leave out what you wish and make lawful what suits you an unlawful what suits you and leave out which does not suit you. You say you desire reforms. Well Taimur our friend has always said he will rule according to the Shara, but it is no use writing and talking like children of what you will take and what you will do. Let us see what both sides can do to make a permanent friendship for talk cannot go on for always and why should enmity continue but if it must continue on your heads be the consequences not on ours. And I am ready to meet Sheikh Isa bin Salih or any one you may name at any time and to talk with him as man to man but not as children. 4 And you know that our force is great but why should we wish to use it indeed we do not if it can be avoided but that rests with you.r i ' No C . of IWiw, V British Consulate and Political iV^ehcy Muscat 26th January I^IP. From i'ajor L# Haworth Political A^ent. Muscat* The Deputy Political Reellent in the Perolan Gulf. Bu; lire. Sir Vifith reference to the informers report No 1 forwarded under this office No dated^7^.^ and paragraph No In my diary for the I have the honour to state that owin^i to the reports I have been receiving of the intended attack on Sur I sent to His Highness the Sultan for his information on the subject* He replied that he had received n.thing to confirm the rumours that were current but that he understood that the movements of notables in the interior and their meeting at Nizweh were for the election of a new Kazi at that place, th ; JP Capital of their theocracy, but that on my enquiry he had/sent special raessangers to obtain correct information on subject* My own information had been so iefinl found it difficultto believe there was nothing the l ‘ * statement although I agreed with the Sultan tb^, it seemed .r&gt;8t unlikely that an attempt should be male Jn a port* I also found it equally difficult to imagine that/1 should receive information of facts of which the Sultan was ignorant. Tbe :lurtarTB~Tirtr^Mtei^er8 have-how returned ad [ x _ : ■f they state that the story of the election of olind to gather togeather the Chiefs. a Kazi is a It appears that the people of Sur,or r ther the important tribe of the Jennebeh at Sur, have written to one of riuravirat# of the interior Shaikh Hanyar bln Naelr el Nabhani a«kin S him to take Sur ani saying that,though they will have to pretend to assist the Sultan owln^ to their exposed position on the sea coaet,they win^in actual fact, do nothing. Shaikh Hamyar -has been pressing this attack and has now converted the Imam, Salim bln Rashid,^its inception. They v nave written to Shaikh Isa bin Saleh asking him to come to Seuei (the nearest ?ert to Nlzweh '&lt;£a the Sharkljreh, Shaikh Isa's Country) and that they will collect there and proceed to the attack on Sure it now remains to be seen what action Shaikh lea will take . ' i0 :s the onl y one of party who has any Idea of the outside world and who Is capable of understanding the pro# and cons of the situation. Sur is a port.about the size of Muscat,with an Inland khor or lake connected with the sea and deep enough to admit of the eatfieteree entrance of the numerous dhows which ar« built at that port, and which, trading with Bombay,Karachi, Zanzibar Calicut and Basra etc,are the source of the wealth of the inhabitants. Two or three miles Inland lies the town of Bilad -es-Sur the seat of the Wall of Sur and situated in date ani fruit cariena. The Sultan tells me that he is infortnei that theJuc opinion of those Omani leaders In favour of the attack is that a snips guns cannot be got to bear on Bilad-es-Sur and that consequently they can take the country down to that point with impunity. This point of view is incorrect. There is nothin.; to pr0V0nt thQ t,own of Bilal-es-Sur bein£ shellei^but up to that point there Is nothing to prevent the country being© occupied by the Omania should they desire it'. .y latest information received while writing tills l&amp;tt -i.et.ter 1 b that Shaikh lea bin Saleh 1 b unwilling to a^ee to any attack , that he has ^Iven no answer at present but that If he refuses nothing win be done. It has been stated to ne that Shaikh Isa bln Saleh was unwilling to agues to the attack on Belt-el-Faltj In 1916 but was overruled. In this case however the attacking troops would have to pass tnrough Shaikh Isa's country and I doubt any action being taken against his wishes. uls highness has asked me to allow one of H.H.

His Highness has after considerable discussion of detail, now agreed to all that has been asked of him for the giving of the loan of 5’ lakhs and in forwarding the correspondence between us I will deal more fully with the Political situation and state the reason why I find difficulty in suggesting any immediate change in our policy in the support of this vain if pleasant puppet Saiyyed Taimur. I am at the same time endeavouring to obtain a meeting with Shaikh Isa though it is difficult to do this without showing him how his -party is, going to benefit in any way by having such a meet ing . It is apparent that any change in their state if it entails the permanence of Saiyyid Taimur is to their ioss and it is only by showing them that the ultimate power is in the # hands of whoever holds the sea ports that such a meeting is likely to be brought about.

As regards reform proposals (Hawarth's 27C March 5th ) I agree with all the financial proposals which would be necessary in any event. The first essential is to ascertain true amount of Sultan f 8 debt and proposed Committee should get to work as soon as possible without waiting for appointment of Customs Superintendent if this seems likely'to present difficulty. Composition might be representatives first of Sultan, second Political Agent and thirdly Principal Creditors. Bemaining proposals are I think (liquidation) sound in principle provided Omaris as a whole realise that their object is neither to main- tain Sultan at all cost nor to extend direct British control but only to improve conditions for Omaris. For this reason I would recommend postponement of levy question until attitude of Imam and his Chiefs has been clearly defined. The difficulties in the way are inherent in any reform scheme and turn on personal aquation. It is necessary to find a Customs Superintendent, a Wazir, a Schoolmaster and an Indian Military Officer all/ of first class calibre all Mohammedans and all Arab speaking. Even if these can all be found such an influx of foreign officials at the same time would I think undoubtedly give impression of establishment of a British Protectorate and I should deprecate so much being taken in hand at once. The Customs Superintendent is an absolute necessity and if rightman can be found and financial position established the rest can be taken up by degrees. Particularly the proposal for appointment of a foreign Wazir sems to me to present great difficulties. I understand his principal functions to be supervision of firstly justice and secondly localiza tion of administration by Walis. The latter task seems tootoo difficult for any foreign Arab or Indian, He would be the mark for every kind of abetruction and intrigue. But failing diacovry of a good Omani the Sultan must behis own Wazir and must be kept up to the mark* As regards Customs personnel (Foreigns telegram 122 S of January 31st) if you have no alternative to Williamson would it not be well to apply at once India and Egypt 1 Finally I consider that there is no explicit promise by Sultan not to borrow money from private persons in future, I think that this should be obtained before loan is paid. Secondly, As regards proposed meeting nothing but good can result. My main reason for / regarding reform scheme with doubt was that if proceeded with without direct communica tion with rebel party it could only arouse their suspicion and hostility. On general attitude of Imam and his followers as disclosed at meeting a definite line of policy can be zS. based sol^y on all matters except finance reform which must take its course in any case.

To t The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Simla. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my telegram No.3696 dated the 1st of April 1919, regarding Muscat affairs, and connected correspondence. 2. Under cover of this letter are forwarded copies of Confidential iwremos Nos. 27C,28C and 29C dated the 5th of Marbh, 1919 from the P.A.Muscat to this Office, of my telegram No.3146 dated the 19th Marhc to the address of the D.P.B.in the Persian Gulf and of his reply No.516 dated the 2nd April 1919. 3, I am in general agreement with Mr. Bill and beg to endorse the caution which he enters against any attempt to move too fast. It is the financial situation which de mands action most urgently and here we are likely to encounter the first difficulties. It is no use ascertain ing the Sultan’s present assets and liabilities unless we obtain from him an undertaking which so far as I know * he has not yet given, that he will contract no fresh debts without the knowledge of the P.A. Further the question as to the agency by which the Sultan’s finances are to be ov rhauled, will, I think, inevitably give rise to dis cussion. For the present, however, we may accept the Cs(n suggestion of a Commission, to be as Mr. Bill says. It would be best if the British Government’s re presentative on the Commission were the Customs Superin tendent, but K.H. may demure to this, on the ground that he would not wish anyone so deeply versed in the mysteries of his exchequer to remain permanently in his service or indeed in Muscat. In that event we shall fexxxx have toVi K- * v V'-N V ***' u &lt;) ®i y look out for a representative on the Commission, as / well as for Customs Officers. In this connection attention is invited to my telegram No.3522 dated 27th Maych,1919, in which the Government of India were informed thct there were no suitable candidates here for the Muscat Appointment and oiiat otner arrangements woul d. consequently be necessary. It that may well be/the Sultan would prefer the P.A. himselfto examine his affairs rather than to submit them to a Com mission. If so, the P.A. should I think, be authorized to accept the task, but not until the Sultan had explicitly asked Mm to do so. If the request came from him the French could scarcely object. 4, I endorse Major Haworth’s proposals as to the an nouncement to be made to the Sultan himself with regard to his personal responsibilities. He should clearly understand, before he gets his loan, and the keen edge of his present straits :s taken off, that hereafter he is, on probation and must keep the promises which he is so ready to make now,if he wishes to retain his present position. 5. This seems to be enough^ to begin with and the rest of the programme, as suggested by Mr. Bill, may be left for gradual introduction as opportunity offers, 5. What has been said above leaves out of accountthe faction in Oman which follows the Imam and is opposed to t/ie oultan. It is in my opinion quite worth while to ascertain their views at as early a date as possible, and clear up as many chances of misunderstanding as possible. There can be but little doubt but that their definition of 'reforms' or 'good Government' would differ v«ry / widely from ours. But at least there may be some common ground and an YX attempt to find it can do no harm. It is therefore oppor tune that, as reported in my telegram under reference Major Haworth has been able to get into communication with them at this early stage in the negotiations. 7. There is one more point, Major Haworth has been at Muscat since October 1916 and is*understood to be likely soon to apply for leave on medical grounds. Whoever suc ceeds him there should be an officer, preferablyVzt Vy the business through. This prospective change of officers is an additional reason for going slow at present. 8.

From Political Muscat To Political Baghdad repeated Buahire No. 78-C Dated 3rd September 1919 Subject - Muscat Affairs. 14th September has been fixed for meeting with ohaiKh Isa. I am correct, I assume, in my presumption tnat no likelihood exists of our ever giving any nature of force to enable the Sultan to regain the control which he has lost over Oman nor would I now reco. .mend such a tuing personally. It is definitely certain’,' I feel, that the Abazi section of his subjects will never be induced by tne Sultan to fight against the Imam should he desire such a thing; this only Wahabis and Sunnis of the Sur -district local Baluchis oiJ Foreign levies are left to him and it is impossible for him to pay these in sufficient numbers. In any case he could not htold Oman with them without the assistance of the British. These being the circumstances I would suggest that agreement be made with the tribes on the oasis of status quo during the tenure of the present Sultan, and ixwaatiixfcJxRnxsoi&amp;gKsfexfcxatfc on the question ol the next to Sultan arriving xaxxxHMix revert to our instituted policy of consulting the wishes of the tribes making the proviso that any ruler who might be appointed would accept all such agreements as might have been made by us with past incumbents.The present Sultan would thus be left to the 1m of tne countryKhi which he now administers and indeed I think that this is a s much as he is able to control effectually. This could with our assistance be brou^it into a condition of elementary organisation sufficient fr for contact with civilised powers. This would be going beyond what we have engaged ourselves kI&amp;x to with the Sultan of Muscat for we have really only engaged ourselves to maintain him in Muscat and ^uttra. It wound leave him with the exception of Nakhl and the valuable valley of Semail with practically all the country over which his ancestors have maintained permanent control. I would also make condition that the Omanis should return to their proper owners all private properties as opposed to state lands. I would further recommend that I may be allowed to give sympathetic consideration to any demand which may be made for the prohibition of the public sale of wine, which would not affect importation by foreigners for their personal use. It is understood of course that I would make no agreement with Shaikh Isa or bind him Government in any way. My object is to know if I should have the general approval of Government behind me in discussing matters on the above lines which would put an end to the Muscat question and should we so desire it would enable us to remove our own troops when the ^ultans levy was formed. I have not stated the above in full detail 9c±fcA to the Sultan but he says =' if we give him poison and say it his drink he will drink it^’ and leaves himself entirely in our hands.Telegram P From Political Muscat To Political Baghdad and Bushlre No.?9-C Dated 6th September 1919 171 th reference to your telegram No. 10410 dated the 4th September to Foreign I can still carry through meeting without taking any risks even if a Navy ship is not obtainable.

Muscat Affairs. Question of negotiations with Shaikh Isa, Telegram from the Foreign Department on the above subject N0.1318-S dated 9th September 1919:* Meeting with Slialkh Isa took place on the 15th and 16th September, He was accompanied by 14 Shaikhs of Oman for the most part men of his own following. They left for Oman on the 17th. Cause ofthe rising was stated by Isa to have been the continued bad ft government by the two previous Sultans and Saiyld Taimur nad shown no signs of improvement. The Walls had been bad while the Kazis were dishonest and took bribes. There was no redress for wrongs and tne Sultans while were apathetic kaJc also dissatisfaction against Sultans existed for religious reasons, Shikh Isa claimed that according to its stand# ard of development Oman was now well governed, Kazis and Walls were selected with care and if oppressive or dishonest were dismldeed,the couhtry was now safe except with regard to inter-tribal fights which were unavoidable among Bedouins, but,he stated merchants and Hindus could travel in Oman and tax trade with perfect safety if tliay were allowed to come. He added that in Oman they were most anxious for the removal of the restrictions of trade and travel. I had explained to hist the general situation and he said that he realised the fact that we were bound to Saiyid Taimur by treaty obligations and that when this fact was admitted they understood that Taimur could not be inter fered with in the country now occupied by him but,he stated, they were bound by religious bonds to the Imam and were not able to accept Saiyid Taimur in the country rules by thelamam and it was only by force that they edtHfr yield up this country which was administered by them according to their religion and which was, so they consiiered, ruled better than it had ever been ruled before. They now had, he said,absolute confidence in the British Government and in its justice and goodwill and in matters not affecting their religion and with the reservatft ions above mentioned they were willing to leave matters to the Justice of the British Government• They wished that the ^itish Government should be their friend and on their part there should be no further hostilities. Bahikh Isa informed me that he would cone immediately in future and at any time that I might require him and he told my dragoman that if the Political Agent or anyone else should so desire it would be perfectly safe for them to * travel in Oran to see the conditions of the government and of the country but that in order to make doubly sure he would himself give then safe-conduct, I explained to Shaikh Isa the reasons for the stoppage of the arms traffic and he spontaneously made the statement that they had no desire that arms should be given to the Shaikhs and tribes as they would only give trouble and fight among themselves. He said that they would like to be in a position to purchase such amount of arms as would enable order to be maintained by the government. The Sultan is willing to accept the situation and is aware of what took place at the meeting. He lid not like the idea of having to send back to Oman refugees from Justice saying that this would be acknowledging that there was a separate Government but when I pointed out to him th4t this already existed he said that he left it entirely to ua. This was tne only point which he raised. It has been explained to Shaikh Isa that I will report to my Government for orders and that he shall be informed of the result. mm* —^ It win be seen tnat the recognotlon of the status quo folnas the simplest modus vlvendl and that both parties are pr*;- ared to accept this solution. The removal of all i-eetrlctlon, to trade a d travel would follow this and we could then, If desired, remove our regiment. There will be no fur .er hostilities# The signature of both parties to the terms oi agreement will be necessary.

The meeting was arranged for 4 p.n. on the 15th and as Shaikh Isa arrived before fche ii♦!! • S»Braiablo tuere was no tiling but to go through with it. In actual fact I was gl&gt;3 of this for I was able to have my first interview without any apparent show of force and thus to get on friendly terms bef re the arrival of the war ship,which at the same time would have been in time had there been any unpleasantness. I was,however, personally in no fear of anything of the kind and had only asked for a ship of war in order to satisfy the natural feeling of Government on the subject.fro hie own followin6 ; th# Hlnawi, and MO follower®. n ey arrived riding upon oamele arid # before advancing to the tents which had been prepared for them,according to their custom they raced their oanels In pair® for ®one short time. Though light In frame tneir animal® appeared to be particularly •aa® fine ones and more graceful In form and movement than 1® u®aa! In camels. It was easy to understand why the Omani camel has so high a repututAion. After entertaining the &amp; rty on hulwa and coffee I met Shaikh lea in the house belonging to the Wall of i uttra which had been placed at my disposal. There were present only Shaikh Isa, Shaikh Said bln Naair el Kindi, my dragoiaan and myself, evryone elae being rigorously kept away, a precaution which might have been neglected since Sliaikh Isa consulted with his Shaikhs who informed everyone of what had been said and Sib knew as much as I Hi og the course of the negotiations.Fortunately there was nothing particularly which I had any desire to keep confidential. I was astonished at the influence which the priest Shaikh Said bln Nasir el Kindi had with Shaikh Isa, an Influence which while It was on the whole for good in explaining situations which I had discussed with Shaikh Sdid was, I aaxlxsltoiadm think inclined to make Isa stronger in his religious determination. They both confessed to me that not all their Shaikhs were as tied to religion as might be desired and it is no doubt to this section that the Sultan refers when he says that had he control of Oman there would be many who would support him. On the other hand as far as practical policy is concerned it is the religious party which comprises all the powerful men and which has away while the name of is one to which ©very Abaxi responds and must respond whether his action is from t e heart or from mere ©xpedienc^. .mmm STS'-' With regM*! to the nesting the m»ln facte of the mentioned In ay telegram No. 8S-C and I need not repeat them. In the beginning Shaikh lea had some difficulty i . «comlng articulate and frankly told me he 414 not know wnat to eay. on this I explained the wnole situation and sly attempted to work out a modu s rlvendl for him on llnee which I have pMmxtmxiX, suggested In an earlier letter, those of the medieval sovereigns and t,,e Popes of Rome ( though In a ' ■ a ::1j theory of Mohammedanism, at any rate of puritanical 'ohamnedanlsm and especially of the Abasl rums on all fours with the temporal claims of the Pope and cannot tolerate the idea of a temporal xea* sovereign controlling the spiritual head,) I suggested tiiat the Sultan should be the al XRKi 40:1 th ® In &gt;s® the spiritual heU, that the Sultan should appoint Shaikh Isa as his representative In the country In whlCi, the Imam resided and that for Semal 1,B1 dbid,Nakhal a 1 ‘ ,e 0048 tal '11 ay at s the Imam should appoint Shaikh Said 1 h'lie - r el Kindi to be his representative; tiiat the Imam or Is representative should ajvxkx* approve of all Kazla before appointment and that there should be a council of Omani not- aoies to assist ths Sultan and that this council should agres LO a11 Wall# a poVtment and should also assist in the control of finance* Isa and Shaikh Said bin Nasir discussed these po - at length with the Shaikhs and on coming back said that they fully saw the friendliness with which^ wltn which the compromise was suggest*! anl tiianked us for It bui^taScQf said, they could not, on religious grounds admit Taiuiurs nominal sway In Or an( It may be that they feared It+s gradual extension fro® nom inal to real) where tliey could only acknowledge the Imam elected oi the people. On the other nand they ap 4 eared quite ready to undertake ■v share of though they would allow him no a control of the Hultan* government eway in Semail,Bldbll or Nakhal. To Unis I replied that tliere was no reason that Taimur v f should give up power where he received nothing in exchange. Finally lea sail that if Taimur had control over all that he now possessed surely that was enough for him* he anl hla forbears, he continued, never had had any control In Behleh and the interior and even in ftemall etc they had never been able to collect the revenue*He agreed that the Sultan should take the coastal Zakat(what we should consider octroi duty on dates etc entering the coastal ports) and that he should charge customs duty which they themselves considered against the law. He said that if all this was left to Taimur the latter would.still have o times as much country as the Omanie had and he agreed t;*at on these terms there should be peace between them, and that the Omanis would undertake no further hostilities of any kind. He said that they now had absolute confidence in our v Justice and that outside of religious matters or of natters in which tney wore bound religiously tuey would leave worldly matter* in our hands. He was particularly anxious for the release of prisoners as the Sultan has 4 of his immediate relations in prison. These men will of course be released on peace being made but there is &amp; counter question of boms garlens belonging to the Sultans cousin the Wall of lluttra and others $he property of his Kasi Shaikh lA&lt;Hi Rashid ** Uiaals. These valuable gardens wore seized by the Imam for the Omani govemnent and he Is loath to give them up saying that what the Ulema have ledare! to be forfeit unier the religious law cannot be given up. Isa admitted his difficulty on tills point as the decision waa not ills but tnat of the priesthood; Indeed I understand he had been against the forfeiture from the beginning.Shaikh Sail bin Naslr •l^Kinli however »a^« tiiat h&lt;i will hiia* ••If go to tho Inara if nocowary and obtain the reload* of tu« garden# which are the only queation at issue and I have no doubt that the question will be settled as desired* * I have reported ti*at the Sultan agrees to the tertus and that the only point he raised «wa* the idea of having to return to Orcan fugitives from Justice. It is however obvious that unless this obligation was reciprocal peace could not result and taore would be constant friction. On 4?gr pointing out tnat a separate Ctovernraent in fact existed and there would be no special recognition of any thing more than what was already actually in practice ne agreed and said he left it to us. Shaikh Isa’s final requests then were but fewi X. Removal of all restrictions to trade and travel. 2. Fixing of the Zakat at not more than 5 p.c*( This is a point on which we have ourselves insisted. In the matter of por egranates the Sultan has been ciiarglng 35 p.c. as tax directed against Siialkh liauiyar bin Naslr el Nabhani, Isa's partner in the direction of matters. The Sultan has agretd to give this up as soon as the gardens at issue are returned.) J fa- 3. Release of prisoners. In Oman, he states,all prisoners have been released.) Shaikh Isatw throughout was cordial, and on his departure he sent a message of thanks for h*e reception.I have reported tiiat at the sane tine he offered a safe conduct for anyone who des ired to travel in Oman. During the two lays stay I entertains! the whole party bit as wll , * seen this docs not entail a very big bill and I kept a long way within the amount sanctioned. It is the oustim for Shaikhs in Oman to receive money for their expenses and for that of their entourage and I gave Shaikh Isa Ra.X60Q for himself and for the Simikhs who were with with and their following.

It is unnecessary, the Government of j.ndia is of the opinion, that the policy to be followed on the death of the Sultan should be laid down at this period of events.

To The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. Sir Reference telegram 1462.S* dated 22/10/19 from Foreign Simla I have the honour to forward the drafts requested. It will be seen from previous correspondence that these drafts are based on the assumption that Sheikh Sayid bin Nasir is succesful in his negotiation for the return of the gardens. If he is not it is probable that further and possibly protracted negotiations will have to take place. In any case the terms will have to be discussed at a personal meeting with the Omanis. It is therefore impossible to say that these will be the final terms. The people with whom we are dealing are barbarous and ignorant to a degree and as everything at present is naturally in a very fluid state it would be foolish to predict the result. The drafts submitted however reppesent the main and essential points for a settlement and are substantlaly on the lines which Sheikh Isa himself indicated at the last meeting. I would ask therefore that discretion be given me to add minor points provided they in no way A, commit Government x and their settlement would smooth the path and promote harmony.

Onan^Novambar 1919• svx^eifCn^ sk&amp;'iWy The mom ant is a suitable one for survaing shorty the events ideas and. personalities which have created, the present situation in south Eastern Arabia, The Sultan of Muscat, Sayit Teimur, in return for a loan granted by Government to pay off his debts, has practically given us a free hand in the reform of his administration • Shlkh Isa bln Salih, the spokesman of the Iman’s party, has met the Political Agent and expressed his willingness to come to an agreement as long as such an agreement does not Involve the suzerainty of the Sultan* The Sultan again, realising the inevitable, has granted us a free hand to make the best we can out of it. Sheikh Sayid bin Nasir al Kindi, next to the Ilian the most prominent divine in Oman, is at the 0 present moment in Nizwa charged with a negotiation to obtafc the restoration of certain gardens in return for the re lease of four prisoners of the rebel party held by the Sultan in Muscat. ON the success or otherwise of Sheikh Sayid depends the possibility of future negotiations and or final settlement. The historical events leading up to the practical severance in a political sense of interior Oman from the coastal regions controlled by the Sultan, nave been ex plained by Major Haworth in his copious notes. They are the result of two maem underlying causes. The first, the fact both historical and geographical, that in Arabia aP.2. ruler of anything more than a tribe or a email confederation of tribes is an anomaly unless his rule is based on moral # force, that is religion, or on material force brought from outsit)e. In the latter case his rule can be but temporary, is bound to be unpopular, and must fall vtfien his source of power from outside fails. The power of the Emirf of Najd is due only to the fanatism of the Wahabi UuxdjL'V sect of which he is the tempaMU^r The chief of the Shammar is an actual potentate becausen of the size, power and homogeneity of his tribe; which the king of the HeAJaz % is supported entirely by us, his administratemn run by Baghdadis or Syrians, and his religeous influence nil* In the case of Muscat and Oman unity was achieved by the great Sultan Sayid Said through his sea power # before the introduction of steamMuscat was a necessary port of call for all ships trading with the Gulf, and its ruler in con sequence controlled the Gulf trade. With the introduction of steam the power of the SultanSof Muscatwaned and their suzerainty over the interior merged from fact to tolerated theory, till final lyxmkslmx misrule and a religious re vival caused even the theory* to be thrown off altogether. The Jfcond main cause is, that looking as we did at Arabia through Indian spectacles , we did not rea- llae this/ and even if we had realised it,it is difficult to see what should have been our right course owing to the many interests Involved. The final nail in the coffin of the Sultans of Muscat was the international difficulties at the beginning of this century which made any regulation by us of Muscat affairs or any recognition by us of the practical existance of another sovereinty in Oman a matter * of difficulty if not an impossibility*e accession of the present Sultan saw therefore an tm- L'Ut possible and almost bankrupt state consistins only of Muscat and the coast towns,chaotic and corrupt admlnlsK- ~tration , and a royal family consisting of an incredible number of syphilitic drones,all of which conditions we were perpetuating by a practically unconditional support* While the interior, Oman proper, under the leadership of a trium- n* vlate composed of the heads of the two great tribal factions united with the Imam whom they had set up, no longer con tent with Home Rule only, was aspiring to the domination of the coast as well and the abolition of a system of mis rule for which we must have been held largel* responsible* The geographical conditions of Oman are peculiar. The mountains which come down to the sea except along the Batinah make agriculture an impossibility on the coast. The coast therefore is unproductive and its Inhabitants live by trade or fishing* Skxs The interior of Oman on the other hand produce^the finest dates in the world and for Arabia it is thickly populated. Against the dates which it exports it imports rice which is the staple diet of the population,and piece goods* Nearly all the trade which passes through the coast towns is of goods for the interior or coming from the interior. It is clear therefore that any rupture of friendly relations betweenthe two will result in hardships for the interior owing to the temporary stop page of trade, while open hostility means a practical blockade. The coast also will suffer a decline in prosperi- ty^ though not a shortage of actual necessaries* The war with the obvious disabilities on trade entailed, aggravated the situation. At the same time it was necessary for us to ensure the safety of Muscatwhich lay on the dirfect route to Mesopotamia. Affairs culminated in*an attack on Mattrah in force by the Imam’s party in 1915 in which the tribes were heavily defeated by our troops guarding Mattrah* Since then till a few months ago matters had drifted from bad to worse. It was impossible for Govern- -ment amidst its many other pressing oacupations to give any attention to the affairs of Muscat, and this was frankly stated. The Sultan’s finances warns in such confusion and such heavy debt that administration became more faroical every day. Jealous of his independence he proved exceedingly difficult when the question of any reform^ which would inevitably mean foreign control, was broached to him. Insistent on his hereditary rights he would have no truck with the rebel party. At the same time our armed support of him made it possible for him tfr impose many irritating restrictions on both trade and persons coming from the interior. In the interior on the other hand, the triuim -virate had consolidated their power and organised their government. But religious bigotry, the stifling of their trade, and the restriction on their personal movements — all the leaders possess property and relations in Zanzibar- exacerbated their feelings even more towards thg reigning house, and it was not surprising that when the Political Agent at last got in touch wi$h them, they would not listen to any terms which implied recognition by them of even the nominal authority of the Sultan; Fortunately the Sultan himself, hopelessly involved financially and unable to renew his bills, after the almost ludicrous failure of a few attempts to make a show of force against the rebelswith his own men, atP.5. last realised the situation-^that without our armed help he would be driven into the sea, without our financial help he would be bankrupt. He therefore consented to un dertake reforms in his administraion, the chief of which was the appointment of a customstldrector by us^and hie control of the finances, in return for a loan to pay his debts. In September of this year the Political Agent in a meeting with Sheikh lea who had been deputed by the Iman, succeeded in putting our case clearly before the Omani p qr t.y That we had no desire to interferewlththem, but that we could not permit *jc attacks on Muscat and Matrah and the coast, and we desired a settlement of the present intolerfcfcfte situation* Uhe result of this meeting was a realisation that reconciliation between the Sultan and tne Imaugwas impossible, that the Omanistheraselves were anxious ftautaxx for a mo dies vivendi, as they were tired out by what was virtually a bleckai*. Minor point, w.re raised a. to the return of property and prl.oners and the removal of the heavy mzakat imposed by the Sultan as a punitive measure. At present It is hoped to conclude an agreement in which we shall be the intermediariesin the form of an exchange of letters between ourselves and the two parties which will recognise the status quo*'this is nothing more or less than the recognition of interior Oman as a separate state, with the provisos of noninterference by Oman wita the Sultan’s jurisdiction and vime versa, and free trade and freedom of intercourse. In other words this is the formal recognition of what has been a fact for nearly fifty years, the sol&amp;difference now being that the interior which does not acknowledge the Sultan is united while before it was not.The factors that make for the possibility or otherwlseof settlement are four * the personal, the religious, the material and the Arab himself* The personal factors are, (1) The Sultan Sayid Telmur, There is no doubt that he recognises the inevitable* He is now so heavily involved with us that it is impossible for him to withdraw even if he wished to* The loan, the introduction of foreign offcials, and the reform of his administration on lines that must differ considerably from the theocratic government of the Imam will make him even more unacceptable to the bigoted party in Oman, who though they may appreciate the benefits of our influence in the improved rule of the Sultan when they visit the coast, would on no account assent to such rule being applied to them* Sayld Teimur is genuinely timed with the whole affair and the undoubtedly trying time through which he has passed* He is a weak though not am unintelligeh$ or unreasonable man* In addition he is so anxious to visit India-'in fact this is almost theonly thing that occupies his thoughts at present— that little p opposition on any point may be expected from him* # (3), The Imam, Sheikh Salim bln Rashid al TChsmslkh n He is the titular head of the opposition movement and the acknowledged religious head of the Abadhl sect even by the most loyal of the Sultan^ subjects* As described the other day he is an ,, ldol ,, set up by the two powerful sheikhs, Isa and Hamyar, and who like an idol may be re moved by them. He is not even,so report says particularly learned from the religious point of view.StiJl his influence ’or. hie position if not from his personality is great, and is of the most bigoted type as is to be expecbited* He would never oppose the two sheikhd. It is quite possible-s that he may oppose an agreement dtn religious gro\inds 9 but if the two sheikhs are in favour of it he will come into V \ line. His brother Sheikh Hasir is an able man* (3) S heikh Isa bln Salih al Harlthl The head of the Hlnawl section of the Omanis and an extremely able and Intelligent man, who has made the revolution and its success* He has given his word that he wishes a settlement and that we should help in it. He is peculiarly hard hit by the imprisonment of his near relatives by the Sultan and by tha fact that he and his tribe (the Krafcfc Hurth) are cut off from access to Zanzibar where they have many relatives and much property* He tempers his religion with knowledge of the world, but he is unlikely fver to break with the Imam or to go back on his word.

In the first place he was willing to go. In the second his son hmldga position of trust with the Imam^and owing to the rebellion he has not seen him for years. In the third as an emissary # he is the most l%kely person to secure our objectowlng to tfte respect he commands. (I have Just heard he has been feted at every village on his way up).Finally the who}e world knows that he has gone with thia object and should he fail the effect on his prestige would be serious. The religious factor can never be left out of @) account. The Sultan is regarded almost as an unbeliever and at any rate heretical^while we are definitely Christian* It would be the relhglous Influence if any that may prove a stumbling block. But to set against this will be the certain opposition of Sheikh Isa and the arguments of Siielkh Sayid bin Naslr whose dicta on points of rellgflon are considered final. The material factor may be summed up in the phrase general war weariness. All are tired, particularly the Omanis, of a situation which is Irksome and in which their profits are heavily curtailed and their movements restrlcted. Finally there is the Arab himself. He is liable to do anything and there is possibly no person upon whom one can rely less. An intrigue or a wave of fanaticism may upset everything at the last moment. Xktmx The Omanis are of a particularly ignorant &amp; barbarous type. However the conditions are on the whole favourable ntstr Shouli Sheikh Sayid bin Nasir succeed the should follow A automatically. lIBLth the government of the interior, beyond ineieting on on safety of travel and freedom to trade, we shall it ie to be hoped^never concern ourselves. In the administration of the coast we are however deeply involved. We control the customs owing to the fti**M*« indebtedness of the Sultan to us. This Is the only source of state revenue. We therefoe entirely controlrco^rta. To secure the necessary yearly valance for the repayment of the loan we must control expenditure to a certain degree. The necessary coroljoraju^ of this is a measure of control over the administration. Several other considerations also make control of adminis- dlueutf CUtm inevltablej^the fact that government was previously so scandoaoue as to reflect seriously upon us as the para mount power. Reform of the administration was therefore one of the conditions of the loan. Such reform cannot come from the inside^* we only can suj&gt;j&gt;ly it. Finally the British interests involved are large as nearly all the trade is in the hands of resident british subjects. i — 1^- A eomencement towardi reform hae been made. The administration of Justice Is better than It was owing to the institution of a regular court. There trained Egyptians have taken over the eustauns and already a vast improvement in the method of working and in receipts has been shown. There will be however two potent factors which willm&amp;ke reform difficult. The first is the people and the second the climate. There are not more than ten Arabs among H.H*s.subjects who can read and write and they are naturally engaged in trade. Among his entourage and his walls there is not one whom he can trust.

We sent him a message with a letter from me and another from the Imam to ask him to come. The mesBsenfcer returned with a letter from Sheikh Isa stating that he was unwell and at present unable to leave his place on account of the severity of the cold and owing to the distance from Nizwa.

Whatever you nave broufth from the Political Officer and in the conditions wnich were made betwween us at Sib, we see the betterment of the Omanis. Mow take the completeness of the talk (probably means “take the final order) from one Imam for he is responsible for his subjects and their wellbeing. We saw the Sheikh Khaliki and his answer was that you are a learned father and know wiiat is fcood and what is harmful. All see that the Imam will follow your words.

I.C.B, Political Agent and H.B.M'b Conflul, Muecat. The Civil Comniasioner, Baghdad. Reference my telegram Number 7.S. dated 2nd January. It will be remembered that as regards the negotiations now pending between the Sultan of Muscat and A the Oman party in which we are acting as the mediators one of the qiestions raised on the part of the Sultan was the return of two very valuable gardens belonging to Sheikh ' Raslild bin Jzzai^. and the Wall of Mattrah which had been forcibly ceased by the Omanis. At the meeting Sheikh Isa on behalf of the Omanis, and Sheikh Said bin Nasir promised tiiat they would arrange this matter. Sheikh Sail bin Nasir was sent by me to Nizwa for tills purpose. That the fulfilment of this condition is essential needs little emphasis. The gardens are private property held under the recognised Mohammedan law, and are not even acquired oroporty but inherited. It would be impossible for the Sultan to acquioce in this being given up, nor could we as mediators lend ourselves to a peace which meant the violation of elementary laws of property. In addition it must not be forgotten that the Sultan, acting under advice from us, has gone a considerable way toward meeting the wishes of the Omanis in the matter of lessening the zakat and the restrictions on enterin^ Muscat and Mattrah. The Omanis must realise that they cannotdemanl evrytliin&amp; and ^ive notliin^;, even when dealing the Sultan of Muscat. At Nl 7 »wa Itself the matter has been delayed. News is difficult to ^et as Niswa is four or five days Journey. The facts as far as I have been able to &amp;ltf[ ascertain then are these-- and they are interesting as throwing a strong ll^ht on politics under the rule of the Imam. Sheikh Isa, and Sheikh Hamyar have both agreed to return the gardens, if the Imam will agree. The Iraani lias told Sheikh Said bin Nasir that he is willing they should be returned if Sheikh Isa will agree. But h£ere are at Nizwa itself a few ^utawwa* or holy men who are doing well as holy men always do, out o£ the confiscated gardens, and they are exercising the strongest possible pressure to prevent the return. The Imam whose word once given is law is terrified of acting against then© men who rule him from $he religious side. Equally Sheikh Isa is raoraen- -tafcily nervous of coming to Nizwa where this religious influence may be brought to bear. Both the Imam and Sheikh Isa are therefore hesitating from giving the final word, and the Imam with Sheikh Said bin Nasir is proposing to go to Qakil, where Sheikh Isa is, there to decide the metter finally. The mutawwa cannotaccompany him. Once his word is given it must be accepted, at the same time he will be abfe able to say that Sheikh Isa persuaded him, while Sheikh Isa will be able to say that the Imam ordered him. Absurd as thie may seem , I yet think that tills Is a fairly accurate p appreciation of the situation. Sheikh Said bin Nasir is certainly doing ills best and his influence is powerful. By sending a letter to Sheikh Isa on the lines suggested in my telegram of 3nd January I hope to bring home to the Omanis the practical side of the question arthe need for decision. Paced with the necessity of saying yes or no, I have every hope they will Bay yes. The leading men desire pease, but it is typical of a theocracy that they fear to act against a few fanaticaj' whom they themselves have put in power. It 1 b strong action only that will bring them to their sences. In the event of an unfavourable reply from Sheikh Isa, I venture to suggest the following course of action which will be fully in accordance with our treaty with the Sultan while it will coramit us in no way, cause us no extra expence and involve us in no aggressive action. It is only necessary for us to cease to restrain the Sultan from acts of retaliation against the Omanis. He will inevitably reimpose the full restrictions on entering Muscat and Mattr?.h, forbid trading with the Omanis and impose a prohibitive zakat. This will certainly cause dislocation of trade and possibly loss to British merchants. . » On the other hand it will only be temporary,and 1$ theoretical -ly fully within the Sultan’s power to take this action. If tiiia is combined with revised custom arrangements and a system of guarantees which I have propoesed elsewhere in cases of export from India, tills will very rapidly bring the Omanis to their reason. It would be necessary to retain the regiment at Mattrah for possibly six more months, and a gun boat should be s stationed permanently at Muscat or the vicinity. I have suggested that the Sultan’s visit to India be officially fixed for the beginning of February whether an arrangement is arrived at with the Omanis or not. This will not be without its effect. I would urge again that in dealing with these people, who are fanatical, ignorant and barbarous, we must not permit shillyshallyinga • Should they not agree to theterms htey have broken their word to ua # and vfe cannot continue to champion their cause against the Sultan for this Is really what we are doing. For however much it may be argued that without our help the Sultan would be driven into the sea, the fact remains that we support the Sultan as the legitimate ruler and that the Omanis are the aggres- -sord. They cannot have their cake and next eat It. I have the honour to be , Sir Your most obedient servant I.C.S. Political Agent, Muscat.From Political Muscat To Political Baghdad No. U/S dated 7/1/30.

Dated 27/3/20. I have had a long interview with Sheikh Said liin Nasir who arrived last night and he also brought a latter from oheikh Isa. Sheikh Isa states in his letter that he collected his sheikhs, brought them before the Imam and asked from the latter agreement under the mediation of the British Government and the return of the gardens. Owing to religious objections the Imam refused this request. Sheikh Isa adds that he hppes that the prlsiners will be returned and that Government will continue to be friendly. My interview with Sheikh Said brought out the fact that first the powerful influence of the Mullahs and secondly overconfidence and bad management on the part of Sheikh Ita were the two causes which brought about the present deadlock. That the greater part of the country and shaikhs were anxious for agreement he was sure but they were helpless against the Influence of the mullahs owing to ignorance. He himself could do nothing and he did not see how anything could ever be done My reply was that Isa had assured government that he was the accredited representative of the Imam. By what he had done he had broken all his promises. Government could not possibly treat with such an untrustworthy man any longer. I should not therefore answer the letter. Then I added that government had exercised their good offices throughout on behalf of the Omanis but as they had now refused to accept our mediation which they themselves had originally asked I ^ould not but suppose that Government would not accept responsibility in the case of any subsequent consequences on the Omanis and would be indifferent in the future as to their well-fare. The effect of this was considerable and he asked me to grant him time as he said he would at once write toShaikh Isa and would report my interview in fill* He \ ^i9ife$onollect the shaikhs to Influence the Imam to reverse the decision as he was convinced serirous consequences must otherwise ensue. I told him he could do as he liked and he asked the date of my return from India. There is just a possibility that this x may have some effect. It is obv&amp;ous that there is intense diflicujjfcy in dealing with this loose confederacy and that the most intelli' gent and powerful chief with the great religious leader and supported by the British Government sho ild confess himself powerless to achieve the the object aimed at is a most significant fact. In my despatch of the 9nd January the course of action to be adopted has been out lined in the event of this having no effect. In India I shall be able to discuss at length the whole question* The visit of the Sultan and Political Agent to India is the strongest card we can now play. It Is bound to affect the Omanis considerably as they can only interpret it as an additional guarantee of our suoport to the Sultan following as it does immediately on the receipt of their answer. The more we uphold hid prestige now the greater will be the possibility of settling the whole question and because the other side refuses temporarily to come to terms does not justify us In punishing th^ Sultan. A good effect at the same time will be produced by MacCollum visiting Masna and Sur in the Britomart as HazLr. The Sultan has been informed of the situation and that as regards his depart ;re I have asked for orders. As the Lawrence 1 l here please telegraph immediately as regards the visit of the Sultan to India.£ti\ 4 : British Ccnsulste end Politicel Agency, Muscet« x) SITUATION IN OMAN AS REGARDS ''HE NEGOTIATIONS AND MEASURES PROPOSED* The negotiations with Omen have so far consisted in two phases, the first^at f empts at last successful to obtain a meeting with a representative of the Iman^s party, the second, attempts to secure ratification of the modus vivendi discussed at that meeting. It is with the latter half of the negotiations that I have been concerned. It was clear from the beginning that opposition must be expected from the bigoted party, who on the plea of religion, had possessed themselves of a large amount of very valuable private property belonging to tvjo of the 3ultan f s most prominent subjects. To overcome this opposition who would naturally have the ear of the Imam, I sent Sheikh Said bin Nasir, a renowned religious jurist who for private as well as public reasons anxiously desired a settlement, to Nizwa, in the hope that his influence would turn the scale and at the same time endeavoured to get Sheikh Isa, who had been the Iman^s representative at the meeting and. who is the most powerful chief in Oman, personally to urge his proposals before the Imam* The opposition at once showed their hand when Sheikh Said reached Nizwa. He however did a great deal of good work and Undoubtedly got a considerable number of sheikhs on our side* Sheikh Isa on the other hand showed a disinclination to prefer his request in person before the Imam. It was at this moment that I proposed an ultimatum. Before this was sent however I received news at last that our long and delicate negotiations to bring Isa up to the scratch were likely to prove successful. Under the circumstances it was undoubtedly best to await the result of the combined efforts of Sheikh Isa and Sheikh Said. ItIt v/es confidently hoped that once Sheikh Iss showed his hand openly accompanied by such a great religious leader as Sheikh Said, the Imam who owed his position to Isa would have to agree. Sheikh Isa finally collected his Sheikhs and on the 18th February all presented themselves before the Imam and asked for an agreement on the lines proposed at Sib, only to be met by a direct refusal from the Imam on the ground of religion. In other words the Mullah party had for the moment triumphed and further negotiation was useless. Every influence except threats and force had been brought to bear. In my interview with Sheikh Said I told him in language which could not possibly admit of two interpretations that the negotiations were broken off and that no responsibility of any kind now rested on Government if anything unfortunate befell the Omanis. He was exceedingly and genuinely agitated at this reply and prayed for more time to point out to the Sheikhs the folly of their present line of action. I assumed the obvious line of complete indifference to anything he or the Omanis should do. le had done our best for the Omanis who had asked us to mediate, this mediation had now been refused and we were not further interested in the matter, but we were at the same time in alliance with the Sultan. That he will try his best I do not doubt, but I am not optimistic as to the result. I entirely believe him v/hen he says that the majority of the people went agreement, but he and i« Sheikh Isa failed when they pressed their case personally end it is not likely that they vdll now succeed by letter. On the other hand the Sultan’s visit to India immediately following the receipt of the reply and the presence this week of one of H*M*s ships at Lasnaah end Sur may give added point to his remarks. As I have reported the refusal of the Imam is due to two main causes (l) Intense igDoranee and the paramount influence for the timetime being of the Mullahs# (2) Over confidence &amp;nd bed menegement on the pert of Isa. To this I would add e third. (3) Belief on the part of the more powerful end intelligent Omanis thet we are only supporting the Sultan in a half hearted manner as we have continually stopped him from imposing restrictions on them and have openly admitted his bad government. There they can do as they like confident that we will not only not interfere ourselves but will stop the Sultan from doing so. The open refusal by the Imam of Sheikh Isa and of the opinion of the majority of the country brings another and important point, that the rule of pure religion is short. It is personal and selfish and based on no consideration of public policy, and in Moslem countries at least the more powerful the religious leaders become the more intolerant does their rule become, and the more do they alienate the people who see themselves suffering because of their unyielding attitude. The brief rule of bin QAIS in Muscat is a remarkable example of this in Omen itself# Sheikh Isa. himself is playing a double game. Should we take no action, well he has obeyed the Imam. Should we take action, well he did his best for us and he hopes to get something out of us. Again in the inevitable reaction against the Imeip if the Omanis find themselves getting an unfortunate time, he will stand out as the wise councillor# The situation from the point of view of the Omanis is 'What is the British Government going to do ?' Should we show a strong hand at once they will speedily come to reason. So far they have rather too much of the fair field and plenty of favour# They must see at once that we are prepared to support the Sultan and that we cannot he trifled with# InLAT”— In my despatch of the End January I indicated that it was quite possible that v/e should have to take strong action, and I now submit in detail what action is necessary. It will be ■O S.- ,, |M _ seen I think that the action contemplated involves Government in no extra expense and only requires a little co-operation, while it must prove very effective* It would not pay us to support the Sultan by military force, nor! would this be effective. Directly the force was want withdrawn the situation would be the same as before. Nor do we/ to impose undue restrictions on trade as this would be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. We must increase the income of the State. We can however assist the Sultan in imposing a number of galling ( and from his point of view perfectly just) restrictions which the Omanis will be powerless to resist. These restrictions will imprest on the Omanis more than anything else the fact that we are supporting the Sultan, as it is these very restrictions which we formerly exerted ourselves to prevent him imposing. I propose to get the Sultan. (1) To increase the ZAK1T on dates from 5 % to 25 % as b temporary and punitive measure openly directed, against the Omanis. (2) To increase the ZAKAT on pomegranates from 35 % to 50% directed especially against Sheikh Hemyer bin Nasir al Nabhani the Chief of the Ghafiri section. (3) To forbid the export of coffee to the Omanis. This is the most essential Arab luxury. At the same time the prohibition will not have much effect on the revenues as the export of such an article is not very large. It will be within the recollection of Government that an increase of the Zakat before was opposed by us and that the whole question formed the subject of somewhat lengthy correspondence. Eventually it seems to have been shelved. I venture to suggest however that the matter has been imperfectly understoodunderstood and that the objections to the imposition will be found to be negligible in the light of the following remarks* The Zaket is in Muscat in no sense an export duty but it is the right of a Moslem ruler to e portion of the produce of the soil. This portion varies but is usually one tenth* It is however fully within the power of the ruler to vary this proportion for special reasons, and that this has often been done is apparent from history. In Muscat the Sultan has taken this zakat on the coast because he was unable to collect in the interior, and usually from the buyers of the produce, that is from British merchants. What has not been understood however is that the incidence of this tax falls on the interior, that is on those who bring their produce down to the coast for sale, because the price paid by the British merchant for the produce is fixed on the express condition that the British merchant the pays/aakat. It is a matter of convenience only. For instance the price at which an exporter can sell a certain kind of date in Indie is say Bs. 30/- per bag. If he promises to pay the zakat he will only pay the Omani at a rate less his profit, the cost of transport and the zakat. The zakat never falls on the British merchant unless it is suddenly altered in the middle of a date season when transactions are in full swing and payment has been made in advance. This was what heppened when formerly the Sultan attempted to impose this measure. No proper notice was given, the whole market was upset and the British merchant rightly compalined. At the same time the events of the last five years have caused the British merchants to stop all running accounts with the producers in the interior. The dates are not paid for till they arrive on the coast, end the method of payment is partly in cash, pertly in rice and piece goods. If full notice is given the merchants may be relied upon to look after themselves# They fix the price which is regulated by outside competition in the Indian market, and they will simply pay a far smaller price© price to the Omanis than formerly or v/hat is the same thing they will raise the price of the goods they sell in return* This is what we 7/ant* The Omanis on the other hand must sell their dates, end through the Muscat end Muttreh firms as they control the merket* ^e expense of transport to the Trucial ::x coast ports is prohibitive* The Sultan will therefore if Government approve at once publish a notice raising the zaket as proposed, stating that this /tax is to be borne by the Omanis, is temporary as a puni tive measure and that the buyers of produce from the interior should regulate their transactions accordingly* This will be endorsed by the P*A. to the British subjects with the remark that as ample notice has been given they are in a position fully to safeguard their own interests. At the same time the Sultan will notify that the export of dates is subject to the condition that his wezir is satisfied that the zakat has been payed in each particular case* He is quite entitled to do this end he will formally ask Government to co-operate with him* It is then only necessary for Government to instruct the customs officials in India to confiscate any cargo that arrives without the necessary pass from thw wazir. This proposed action will also be notified* If the attached note on the date trade is studied it will be seen that under these circumstances the Omanis ere perfectly helpless, and if this does not bring them to reason nothing will. Ho attempt will be made to stop trade which v/ill be encouraged by the granting of generous allotments of rice* In this connection I would strongly press that the remaining rice allotments he made at once as on these depends the whole trade of Oman* In view of the long coast line and the great difficulty * of controlling smuggling I have repeatedly urged, co-operation between the Indian and Oman customs. Dhows should not he permitted to clear from Indian to Oman ports except under guarantee which will not he released until a certificate has \ v been0 been received from the Omen customs thet the duty hes been paid* This will have an astonishing* effect on the Omanis and the more recalcritant ports, in addition to increasing the state revenue. Immediate orders are solicited on this proposal* 'he export of coffee from Indie will only be permitted under pass from the Sultan or his wezir countersifxed. by the P*A. This will also be notified* I should not be in the least surprised if the mere , ^ announcement of these proposed measures brought the Omanis to reason. For this propose I propose to have one thousand of the notices printed in Arabic in India end to he signed by the Sultan. These can be sent to the wazir who will arranre to have them distributed all over the coast and the interior* It must he borne in mind that nov/ the Omanis have no offensive power for the very simple reason that they have no cartridges for their rifles. In addition they got a severe lesson once and are not likely to trj 7, again. This touches on the important question of the retention of the regiment. In my opinion there is no need for the regiment to remain at Futtrah beyond December of this year, and I only advocate their staying the hot weather as while we are enforcing our punitive measures (which do not require a regiment for offensive or defensive) it would help us to frighten the Omanis as much as possible* But definite arrangements should he made for it to go then* As long as there is one of H.M's ships within close cell of Muscat we can support the authority of the Sultan quite adequately* With a British Officer as adviser a moderately efficient force can be organized, at any rete sufficient to keep the Omanis from attacking Muttrah if they do not come to heel. I am submitting a separate note on the measures to be taken to give the Sultan some effective authority. Now the Omanis have virtually turned down our proposals our position is very strong. We have given them every chance. Our line now is to back the Sultan and increese his prestifre. toto show the Omanis that R.Hofssisted by us has the po?/er to make matters extremely unpleasant for them* And we can do this without any extra expense or commitments and with comparatively little exertion. There is only one way to deal with the Arab* Note* On arriving* at Karachi I received a telegram announcing the death of Sheikh Hemyar bin Rasir al Kabheni paramount chief of the Beni Riyem and head of the Ghafiri section of the Omanis* I had for some time heard that he was ill but had not expected such good fortune* This makes the Oman situation very curious* The Imam was the figure heed Isa the brains and Hemyar the strength of the Omani party* In the Beni Riyem there is no one to succeed Hamyer, or rather his successor cannot hope to command the united support of the Beni Riyam and will probably not obtain any support ?/orthy of the name without tribal fighting Whet effect this will have upon Sheikh Isa it is impossible at present to say* It may strengthen his hand or it may for the moment make the Mullah party momentarily more powerful. In any case it will create disunion* Now is the time to strike. One of the three great personal factors on the Omani side is eliminated, and it is not necessary to enlarge on the effect of such an event on an Arab confederation*Trensleted purport of e letter to the Politioel Afrent, Muscat from Sheikh Ise hin Salih and brought by Sheikh Said bin Kasir al Kindi.

Today we saw the Imai for the return of the gardens and in order to have an agreeme: v/ith the Great Government. But there is a party of the Sheiki of Omen who were opposed to us end who were one and we could not get agreement from the Imam though we tried our utmost. ;Y' had informed Major Haworth who was then Political Agent at Sib that he should not ask anything from us which concerns oui religion. We hope that the Government will treat the Omanis kindly, We hope that you will try and get the Prisoners released and that the Sultan will hear you. Other things will be made known to you verbally by Sheikh Said bin Be sir who is sufficient for us on our behalf.Additions! note of Zskst question. Two confidentiel demi-officisl letters one dfted 3Cth September 1914 and the other 2Cth of July 1915 go at some length into the question raised by the imposition of an extra Zekabss a punitive measure. It will be seen from these that whatever the rights or the wrongs of the matter there is general agreement that provided due warning is given British merchant anticipates loss whatever increase is imposed. This is a candid admission of their power to fix the price they like and of the powerlessness of the Omanis to stand out against the price. Dry dates must be exported as the Omani does not consume them, and the less he gets for them the more anxious he will be that an agreement should be arrived at which increases his purchasing power. Equally the best v/et dates must be exported to America and the Omanis must sell at whatever price the dealers ask. It is just possible that the trade in inferior wet dates may diminish but this is not important and in any case it is temporary, as a natural condition of an agreement will be the reduction of the Zekat to the original 5%. In my opinion it is not likely that the general import trade will suffer. Through the restriction of import of essential commodities from India prices have risen enormously, rice as I am well aware being sold at a profit in many cases of 100$ • This is stifficient proof that the Omanis are prepared to pay almost anything for commodities which they regard as essential, and are not in the least likely to be deterred by the balance of trade going against them owing to rising prices of the commodities they import. They will try and reduce this adverse balance ( and the only way they can do this is by an agreement) but they will still continue to purchase. The Omanis like all Arabs have very great purchasing power. In fact the purchasing pov/er of the smell communities in face of rising prices is a remarkable phenomenon of the war. In addition the rise in the value of the dollar must be remembered% remembered# The Omanis have consequently felt the rise in prices very little compared to others* If necessary a notice might be issued that His Highness is prepared to set aside a proportion say 20 % of the proceeds of the enhancei tax for indemnifying* those merchants who suffered by the unannounced imposition of the tax in 1914 end whose claims against the Sultan are still outstanding* Otherwise I would again most emphatically urge that the British Indian traders ere perfectly capable of looking after their own interest v/hetever happens.Note on the purchase end export of detes from the interior of Omen. Detes ere imported into Muttra by selling vessels from Rustaq, Nizwsh, Nskhel, Wadi Maawelvie the Batineh coast ports of Barkaft, Maanaa, ^uwaiq and Sib« They are also imported into Muttra from Wataiya, Hajar, Head, Panjah, Nabha, Bidbid, vSurur Kele, Bir, Kobe, Khebar, Sameil, Wadi bin Ruweh, Tau, Nizwah and from the interior of Sharkiyeh on camels. They are imported into Muscat by sailing vessels from the same ports stated above. A duty of 5 per cent is levied and is paid by the purchaser either at one of these ports when shipped or at Muscat or Muttra. Before the disturbed state of the interior of Oman British Indian merchants living on the Batinah Coast ports used to go in the interior to purchase dates but since then they have stopped doing so. They have also stopped giving large amounts on loan. Purchases are now made by them through the camel owners of the ports who act as brokers for them. These brokers buy dates from the people in the interior at a certain rate agreed to by the British merchants end deliver them at these ports. The British merchants in turn send them either direct to India or to Muscat and Muttra for shipments to India. The direct export from these ports is insignificant. The cost is generally paid in goods, such as rice. Sugar, Piece Goods, coffee and Twist and Yarn. It is sometimes paid in cash also. During the period of 7/ar the dates were shipped to India in sailing vessels only owing to the absence of steamers and higher rates of freight charges prevailing at the time. This year the B.I.S.N.Coy. having lowered the rates slightly some shipments have been made by steamers but chiefly they are sent by sailing vessels.SITUATION IN OMAN AS REGARDS THE NEGOTIATIONS AND MEASURES PROPOSED• Tii« ne^otitionfi with Oman have so far consisted in two phases, the first attempts at last successful to obtain a meeting with a representative of the Imamta party, the second attempts to secure ratification of the Xa modus vivendi discussed at that meeting. It is with the latter half ef the negotitions that I have been concerned. It was clear from tne beginning that opposition must be expected fr m the bigoted party # who on the plea of religion had possessed themselves of a lar^e ameunt of very valuable private property belonging to two of the Sultan's most prominent subjects. Te overcome this opposition who would naturally have the ear of the Imam I sent Sheikh Said bin Naslr, a renowned religious Jurist whe for private as well as public reasons anxiously desired a settlement to Nizwa in the hope that his influence would turn the scale and at the same time endeavoured to 0 et Sheikh Isa who had been the Iinam 1 representative at the meeting and who is the most powerful chief in Oman personally to ur te e his proposals before the Imam The opposition at once showed their hand when Sheikh Said reached Nizwa. He however did a great deal ef good work and indoubtedly got a considerable number of sheikhs on our side. Sheikn Isa on the other hand showed a dlsincli- -nation to prefer his request in person before the Imam. It was at this moment that I proposed an ultimatum. Before this was sent hewever I received news at last that our long and delicate negotiations to bring Isa up to the scratch were likely to prove successful. Under the circumstances it was undoubtsdly best to await the rssult of the combined efforts of Sheikh Isa and Sheikh Said.hand opanly aocompanlad by such a &amp;reat rali^oua laaier as Shaikh Said Iktia Ifiam who owed hie position to lea would have to a^aa. Shaikn lea finally collacted hi a Shaikh* and on the 18th February all presents l themselves before the Iiiiam aniarid asked for an a^eement on tu* lines proposed at Sib # only to be met by a direct refusal from tne Iicam an the ground of religion. In ether words the Mullah party had for the moment triumphed and further negotiation was useless. Every Influence except tiireats and force had been brought to bear. In my interview with Sheika Said I told him in language whioxi could net possibly admit of two inter- -pretations that the negotiations were broken off and that no responsibility of any kind now rested on Government if any- •thing unfortunate befell tne Omanis. He was exceedingly and genuinely agitated at tnls reply and prayed for more time to point out to the Sheikhs tus folly of txieir px'esent line of action. I assumed the obvious line of complete indifference to anything he or tne Omanis should do. We had done our best for the Or.anis who had asked us to mediate, tills mediation had new been refused and we were not further interested in tn# matter, but weWere at the same time in alliance wita the Sattca Sultan. That he will try his best I do not doubt, but I am net optimistic as to the result. I entirely believe him when he says that the majority of the people want agreement, but he and Sheikh Isa failed when they pressed their case personally and it is net likely that they will now succeed by letter. On the ether hend the Sultan** visit to India immediately following the receipt of the reply and the presence tills week of one of H.M’s ships at Masnaaa and Sur may give added point to his remarks. As I have reported the refusal of the Imam is8 iu« to two main oausoa (i) Intense l^noranoo anl the paramount Influonce for th# time bolng of tne Mullahs, (d) Overconfllonoo and bad mana^emauit on tne part ef Isa* To this I would add a third (3) Belief on the part of the more powerful and inteilige^ Omanis that we are only supporting the Sultan in a halfhearted manner as we have continually stop, ed him from imposing restrictions on them arid nave openly admitted his bad government. Therefore they can do as they like confident that we will not only not inter- -fere ourselves but will stop tne Sultan from doing a so. The open refusal of Sheikh Isa and of JfcH tne opinion ef the majority of tne country brings another and important point, that the rule of pure religion ie short* It i- is personal and selfish and based en no consideration ef public policy, and in Moslem countries at least the more powerful the religious leaders become the more intolerant does their rule become and t.e more do they alienate the people who see them selves suffering because of their unyielding attitude. The brief rule of AZZAN bin QXIS in Muscat is a remarkable example of this in Onan itself. Sheikh Isa himself is playing a double game. Should we take no action, well he has obeyed the Imam. Should we take action, well he did Ms best for us and he hope# te get somet/iing out of us. Again in the inevitable reaction against the Imam if the Omanis find themselves getting an unfortunate time he will stand eut as the wise councillor. The situation from the point of view ef the Omanis is 'What is the British Oevernment going to de 1* Should we show a strong hand at ence they will speedily come to reason Se far they have had rather too much of the fair field and (Tplenty of favour. Thoy at •nee that wa ara prepared k to aurport the Sultan and that we cannot be trifled with. In my despatch of the 2 nd January I indicated that It was quite possible that we ehould have to take strong action, and I now submit in detail what action is necessary. i It will be seen I think that the action contemplated involves Government in no extra expense and only requires a little cooperation, while it must prove very effective. It would not pay us to support t e Sultan by military force, nor would tide be effective. Directly the force was withdrawn the situation would be the same as before. Nor do we wnfcxfc«want to impose undue restrictions on trade as this would be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. We must Increase the income of the state. We can however assist the Sultan in imposing a number of galling ( and from his point of view perfectly Just ) restrictions which the Omanis will be powerless to resist. These restrictions will impress 0*. the Omanis more than anything else the fact that we are i supporting the Sultan as it is these very restlctlons which w# formerly exerted ourselves to prevent him imposing. I propose to get the Sultan (1) To increase the ZAKAT on dates frsm to 35^ as a temporary and punitive measure openly directed against the Omanis To increase the ZAKAT on pomegranates from 35 ^ to 5C# directed especially against Sheikh Hamyar bin Nasir al Nabhanl the chief of the Gnafiri section (3) To foroi i the export of coffee to the Omanis. Tills is the most essential Arab luxury. At the same time the prohibition will not have much effect on the revenues as the export of such an article is not v^ry large. It* will be within the recollection of Government that an increase of the zakat before was opposedby us anl that the whole aabjsefcxiiaaquestlon formed tn# subject of somewhat lengthy corresmpondence. Eventually it seems to have been shelved. I venture to suggest however that the matter has been imperfectly understood and that the ebjectiens to the imposition will be found' to be ne 5 ligible in tne li^ht of the follewing remarks. The zakat is in Muscat in no sense an export duty but it is the right of a Moslem ruler to a portion of the produce of the s il. This portion varies but is usually one tenth. It is however fully within the power of the ruler te vary this proportion for special reasons, and that this has often been done le apparent from history. In Muscat the Sultan has taken this zakat on the coast because he was unable te collect in the interior, and usually from the buyers of the produce that is from British merchants. What has not been understood however is that the incidence of this tax falls on tho interior, that is on those who bring their produce down to the coast for sale because the price payad by the Britieh merchant for the produce is fixed on the express condition that the merchant pays the zakat. It is a matter of conven- -ience only a&amp;&amp;xJrXic&amp;. For instance the price at which an exporter can sell a certain kind of date in India is say Rs. 30/~ per bag. If he promises to pay the zakat he will only pay the Omani at a rate less his profit, the cost of transport and the zakat. The zakat never falls on the British merchant unless it is suddenly altered in the middle of a date eeason when transactions are in full swing and payment has been made in advance. Thie was what happened when formerly the Sultan attempted to impose this measure. No proper notice was given, the whole market was upset and the British merchant rightly complained. At the same time the events of the last five years have caused the British merchants to stop all runningaccounts with tho proiucers In tne Inferior. Tne dates are not payedl for till they arrive on the coast, and the method of payment Is partly In cash, partly In rice and piece If full notice is given the merchants may be relied upon to look after themselves. Tney fix the price which is regulated by outside loicoiapetition in tae Indian market and tney will simply pay a far smaller price to the Oraanis than formerly or what is the same thing they will raise bhe price of the goods they sell in return. This is what we want. The Omanis on the other hand must sell their dates, and through the Muscat and Muttrah firms as they control the market. The expense of transport to the Trucial coast ports is prohibitive. The Sultan will therefore if Government approve at once publish a notice raising the zakat as proposed, statin that tills tax is to be borne by the Omanis, is temporary as a punitive measure and that the buyers of produce from tiui interior should regulate their transactions accordingly, TrJIs will be endorsed by the P.A. to tne British subjects with the remark that as ample notice has been given they are in a position fully to safeguard tneir own interests* At the same time the Sultan will notify that the export of dates is subject to the condition that his wazir is satisfied that the zakat has been payed in each particular case. He is quite entitled to do tnls and ne will formally ask Government te cooperate with him. It is tnen only necessary for Government to instruct the customs officials in India to confiscate any cargo that arrives without the necessax’y pass from tne wazir. This propesed action will also be notified • If the attached note on the date trade is studied it will be seen tnat under these circumstances the Omanis are perfectly helpless, and if tills does not br’ng them to reason nothing will. No attempt will be made te stop trade which will be encouraged by the granting of generous allotments ofPlot. In tnlt connection I would strongly prett tnat tUt remaining rice allotmente be made at one# aa on theae depend a the whole trade of Oman. In view of the len&amp; coast line and the £reat difficulty of controT.lln&amp; amu^lina I have repeatedly urged cooperation between the Indian and Oman customs. Should ftaanc dhawe not be permitted to clear from Indian to Oman ptrta except under guarantee which will not be released until a certificate has been received from the Oman customs that tne duty has been payed. ThA* will have an astonishing effect en the Omanis and the mere recalcrltant ports, in addition te increasing the state revenue. Immediate orders are solicited en this proposal. The export of coffee from India will only be permitted under pass from the Sultan or his wazir counter signed by the P.A. This will also be not fled. I should not be in the least surprised if the mere announcement of these proposed measures brought the Omanis to reasen. For tills purpose I propose to have one thousand of the notiioes printed in Arabic inlndla and to be signed by the Sultan. These can be sent to the w&amp;zlr who will arrange to have them distributed all over the coast and the interior. It must be borne in mind tnat now the Omanis have ne offensive power for the very simple reason that they nave no cartridges for their rifles. In addition they get a severe lesson once and are not likely to try again. This touch es on the important question of the retention of the regiment. In my opinion there is no need for the regiment to remain at Muttrah beyond December of this year, and I only advocate their staying the hot weather as while we are enforcing our punitive measures ( which do not require a regiment for offensive or defensive purposes ) it would help us to frightenthe Ounlt as much as possible. But definite arrange ^ s should be made for it to &amp;o then. As lon&amp; as ther is one of H.Ms ships within close call ®f Muscat fe can support the authority of the Sultan quite adequately. With A British officer as adviser a meierately afficient foree can be organised, at any rate sufficient to keep the Omanis froi* attacking Muttrah if they do not come to heel.

Now the Omanis have virtually turned down our proposals our position is very strong. 7» r e have given them every chance. Our line now is to back the Sultan and Increase his prestige, to show the Omanis that H.H. assisted by us nas the power to make matters extremely unpleasant for them.

To The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. MEMORANDUM Situation in Muscat and Oman. The breakdown in the negotiations at the end of February owing to the definite refusal of the Imam toretum the gardens in dispute was followed by the immediate departure of the Sultan to India accompanied by me. At the same time arrangements had been made by which the Brit^omart was to visit Masnaah and after that Sur at both of w&amp;lch places the authority of the Sultan had been openly defied, and at the former of which the lives and property of British subjects had been in considerable danger, in order to show that we were prepared in accordance with our engagements to support the authority of the Sultan on the coast. At Masnaah the refusal of Sheikh Masaud bin Zamit, the person responsible for the trouble to come to the •hip and apologise^resulted*in his village being fired on after due warning. There is no doubt that he never expected that we would carry out our threat, and also that as his village was 7500yards from the coast he was perfectly safe. The effect of this action was electric as I had ventured to predict that it would be some time ago. A week later Masaud came in to Muscat and paid a fine of 5000 dollars and ggvo guarantees to behave in the future, to support the Sultan^ government in every way and to be responsible that his tribe paid the recognised customs dues. When the wazir went to Sur on the Britomart the people of their own accord paid all arrears of customs dues and promised to pay five per cent for the future. Later on the Sultan’s government ordering the Sheikhs of the Hawasnah and the Beni Amir who had beenfi&amp;intin£ for over three years, ani who had previously declined to answer any communication from the Sulfcfrn, to make f peace, the sheikhs in question came into Muscat and signed a bond of perpetual peace in the presence of the Qazi on the Koran, The Sheikhs of the Yal Saad at much the same time wrote to Nasir bin Rasliid the brother of the Imam and his Wali in Rostak that they would in the 'future not permit attacks on the territory of the Sultan by the Omanis and would unite in resisting them should the oaaasion arise. At the bejiinnin^ of ]&lt;Iarch news was received of the death of Sheikh Hamyar bin Nasir al Nabhani of the Beni Rljt&amp;in and paramount of the G-hafiri section of the Omanis. This man with Sheikh Isa bin Salih the Hinawi chief made the Omani rebellion, and he was unquetionably the most powerful man in ©man. Later Information is that his son Suleiman, a boy of about sixteen years of a^e has been elected paramount chief in his place. It seems from the general opinion that Suleiman for the moment at least will not command the unconditional support of all sections of the Beni Riyam, What his attitude towards the Imam will be remains to be seen and has already formed the subject of rumour and conjecture. It is a fact that Suleiman obviously actingpunder the advice of the elders of the tribe excused himself from mmkin£ the 'bay 1 at” or religious bond with the Imam, on the ground that as he was a boy he was unable to perform the duties adequately. He only declared himself ,, zimmi ,, or in alliance with the Imam. It is supposed that he is frightened of having to give up some of his lar ,e inher- -itance to the beit-al-mal of the Imam should he ttbke the religious oath of obedience, or that he may have to commit his tribe to some action engineered by Nasir bin Rashid the brother of the Imam,who is becoming increasingly unpopular. ‘ It is fairly certain that there is something behind this’ flimsy excuse, A somewhat unfortunate and unexpected situation had meabwhile arisen at Hazm, a town about fifteen milesinla a ■“■'’ora Maenaah. This town is ruled by Aiimed oin Ibrahim formerly wall of Rostaq under the Sultan, or less Independently of Sultan or Imam between wnose borders the place lies• Ahmed has had an adventurous history and is a strong man amon^ the Arabs* Nasir bin Rashid the brother of the Imam is the Imam’s wali of Rostaq. Ahmed lately had been very useful to the Sultan’s government over a slave case and had also been instumental in bringing Masaud bin Zamit to reason. Seeing a chance of getting back his lost power over Rostaq, aware that many of the tribesmen of the Wadi Muawal were discontented with t he rule of Nasir bin las^iid and kuk counting on the su port o* the Yal Saad, he approachei iasir bin Rashid on the subject of the slave dealers who had taken 9 refuge with him in a way that could scarecely fall to produce a breach,and at the same time deliberately twisted two letters which the wazir had written to him and the Yal 8aad into an order to rise against fcfcNasir bin Rashid. AJtHe also wrote to the wazir stating that the Omanis were rising against him and asked his immediate help. At present there seems to be a stab of open hostility between the two but no fighting, ^ach side is waiting taxto see what the other side will do. I have advised the wazir to take no action which could be interpreted as an attack by the Sultan on the Omanis, though to punish/ severely any attack by them on territory which acknowledges the Sultan. Ahmed may be left to work out his own salvation. He is far too skilled in Arab intrigue not to have taken his present action without ^calculating that he has a good chance of success. Should he be able to give Nasir bln Rashid a bad time no harm is done. Should the latter be successful the tribes will probably be able to resist him if hh extends his attack to the Sultan’s territory as they will certainly get help in the form of ammunition and money which is all they want from the Sulfcfcn. Our support of the Sultan is confined entirely to upholding authority on the coast and I haveon tne wazir the necessity in his very delicate position of taking no action which could possibly be inter- -preted as support by the British &amp;overanent of an attack by the Sultan against the Onanis. In the middle of April Abbas and Mahomed the sons of Mahomed bin Turki who was the elder brother of Sayid Faisal and who always considered himself as having been wrongfully deprived of the throne, fled to Oman. The reason for this seems to have been the decrease in their allowances ordered by Sayid Teimur. Both these boys are mad and in the deepefet debt, 'he Sultan anturally hates them and had not exerted himself to save thmu—Xmm from the consequences of their own folly. Certain rather strong action which the wazir too^ against them under the Sultan’s orders may have jim hastened their flight, but they had for some time previously been pulling down their houses and selling their property which points to a long thought out plan. They have been well treated in Oman on the 'madhlum' theory, and the somewhat illadvlsed action of the wazir in offering a reward for their return has possibly improved their position. B)t is not however likely that they will in any way prove a rallying point for the Omanis, though they will be useful* material wi ou whiCii to fan the Omanis into more than usual hatred of the Sultan. # Since my ettrn I have had interviews with Shekh Said bin Nasir and with Hamud bin Azzan bin Qais a former hakim of Rostaq and now resident in Seraail in the territory of the Imam. Both report a akstate of consideisble xaajt&amp;xkkiE apprehension among the OmaSits as to what is going to happen next. The departure of the Sultan to India ani the action taken at ITasnaah have aroused gloomy forebodings. I continued on my former lines tJiat as the Omanis had refused the terms we were not further interested in the matter. Sheikh Said had receive! a long letter from Isa bin Salih in reply to the one whica he had written on ray departure. This letter which I saw' 4T / ' irt was one long excuse ani harping on the point that it was not his fault th tthe Imam had refused and thfct he had tried his best. The latter is of course not true. Sheikh Said was far more optimistic than formerly and further letters are passing urging an amicable settlement of the whole x&amp;xkxx matter• My dragoman has also received visits from unofficial emissarie from influential men in the interior which seem to indicate that a change of decision is possible. * It is quite impossible to say at present which way the cat will jump. There are rumours of another tribal xfc majlis at Rostaq under the Imam but as to what this is for nobody as yet knows. It may be to reconsider the decision or it may be to call the tribes to rise and attack the dominions of the Sultan. This latter is always a jaaxKkkki possibility and would be by no means a bad thing if it happened. Such an attack would not in all probability take place till the dated had been harvested and would form an excellent chance for heavy punishment. It is becoming increasingly evident that the Omanis only understand force majeur and till they are convinc d that it is there, the chance of their behaving themselves or of returning the property they have looted is small. In Muscat itself on my return the situation was somewhat curious and not very satisfactory• Reform had been too rapid and H.H’s government had acted on several occasions without fully considering the possible consequences of their acts. Actions had been strong without being very tactful. Order has certainly been introduced into the administration and the state for the first time for many years is paying its way. n Gro slow' is a maxim which it is of considerable importance to remember in the east, and H.H’s are now I think fully convinced of this. The more glaring ? j’PVdTi.o* Formerly it was somewhat naturally supposed that any 'Dhulm' was due to the British goveramsent-, but it is now ascribed tothe Sultan acin&amp; without the alvice of the British, The (W latter opinion ir view of our position with regard to the interior ani the rest of Arabia is clearly the more desirable The attitude of the present Sultan as has been reported elsewhere is deserving of earnest consideration. 1 e i s out to abdicate and he will twist and turn in India to delay his return. That he should return if only temporarily is necessary to avoid a false impression being produced. But even if he does return the fact must be faced that he does not wish to stay, and consequently that it would be foily,to try and make him. We shall enormously increase our own difficulties by such actiob. A definite and open statment of policy with regard to Muscat and Oman is called for at an early date. Minority rule with a council of regency and a few advisers is the only solution of the problem of the future administration that I can see, and if at the same time we shoula declare our determination to preserve the independence of Muscat and our eaitkxsL purpose not to interfere in any way with the freedom or government of the interior under the nominal rule of the Imam, we shall I venture to suggest have gone a long way to solve this very difficult problem. It is ' iie unc e^tainty aa to what our real objects are inxkh and tais uncertainty is not confine! to the problem of Muscat, that makes settlement difficult.

I attach for your guidance a copy of my note, which you will observe supports in general terms the policy proposed in your note dated March 1920. I request you will take action accordingly. 0. I presume that you do not think that the action proposed will provoke reprisals on the cart of the Omanis and that the regcent reduction of the garrison at Muttra from one regiment to half a regiment (reduced to companies by finding the detachments at Jask and Charbar) has not been premature? When I agreed to the above reduction I did not think that any action against the Omanis was contemplated, and in writing my note of the 19th April the fact of the approaching reducti^ of the garrison had escaped my memory. I presume however that you do not expect any recrudescence of hostility among the Omanis. I have the honour to be, s 3f, Your mosjtyobedient servant, iieut-Col. noTYnt.v Pni i ti cs,l Resident!

The first stage of the negotiations with the Omanis had finished and the second starre had commenced when I returned to the Persian Gulf from leave. Further for some months before my return all matters connected wfcth these negotiations end other political matte-s in Oman were dealt with by the Acting Civil Commissioner and the Political Agent Kuscat in direct correspond- enc e • Cohsequently I had no locus standi in the matter, and could only wait and see what resulted from the negotiations. As however I am of opinion that the reason, which more than any other united the various rebellious factions in the inter : or against the Sultanate, was the late Sultan T s supposed co-opera tion with us in suppressing the Arms Traffic, I need hardly say that my sympathies have always been with the Sultan. The Omanis always seemed to think that the late Syed Faisul voluntarily gave away his and their right to import and sell arms etc, never apparently realizing that His Highness usually acted under force raaj eure• I have always been in favour of doing what we can to supnort the Sultan against the rebels, while at the same time assisting him to reform his administration. The failure of the negotiation due entirely to the unreasonable attitude of the Omanis has put them completely on the wrong, and strengthened my opinion that we should act as suggested above. The Political Agent suggests that the Sultan should now bring pressure to bear 6n his rebellious subjects by increasing zakat on da^es and pomegran: tes and prohibiting the exmort of coffee to the Omanis. II think that it is certainly advisable to bring pressure t bear on the rebels, and that the measures suggested by Itr. Wingate can be easily enforced and may possibly bring the Omanis to reason, and should be given trial. It is true that the second measure proposed, viz zakat on pomegranates was directed against fhaikh Hamyar bin Nasir, and that this in dividual is dead, but presumably some relatives and tribesmen of his will be hit by the tax, and I think it snould be enforced I have, to the best of my recollection, on former occasions opposed the levy of excessive zakat by the Sultan, but this has been on occasions when tax has been erfo'ced suddenly, and its incidence has, to a considerbale extent at all events, fallen on British Indian exporters or purchasers of date crops. If consicderbale notice is ‘given, and now that British Indian mer chants have apparently ceased to buy up in advance, or give heavy advances, date crops up country, there seems, as hr. Wingate says, no danger of any portion of the zakat falling on British traders - nor even, as the Muscat date crop does not, I imagine, affect the world market to any appreciable extort, on the consumer. As regards the question of the Indian Customs Department co-operating with the Oman Customs, which is again raised by Mr. Wingate, I have already expressed my views; I am doubtful if the scheme will commend itsblf to Government as it will certainly ±fe be^to some extent^ restraint on trade, an^ in any case I doubt if it would be effective for long as dhows simply would not cloar for Oman ports but for Persian or Arab ports in tne neighbourhood, from.which extensive smuggling operations would take place. My idea is that the present is a favourable opportunity to assist the Sultan to recover his general Suzerainty over Oman.; I 3m ret think he can ever expect to have the tribes under his direct control but merely recognition as paramount authority in the neighbourhood. Occasionally when particularly powerful thethe Sultan might get a little revenue or tribute from the interior. This would however be of minor importance; if he got his revenue from the coastal area and from customs and zahat, this should be auite sufficient to run his state in a fairly sa tisfactory manner and give him a reasonable income. It would be a misfortune if the Sultanate disappeared as the country would almost certainly lapse into a conglomeration of petty Shailrhdoms - with a few two fairly large tribal Shaikhs - with whom it would be very inconvenient to deal. Sd/- A.P.Trevor, Lieut-Col. Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf® Eushire 19th April 1920.CONFIDENTIAL / * British Consulate and Political Agency Mascat 36th May 1930* From R#E.L*Wingate K&lt;st^* X*C«S» Political Agent and H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. To The Deputy Political Resident, Bushire, Sir With reference to your letter No.l5«5/ s ^ated 14th May and enclosure, there is a paragraph In the latter on the subject of cooperation between the Indian Customs Department and the Onan Customs in which you again deprecate this proposal. I venture again to address you on this subject as the proposal as regards the date trade and the penal zakat stands on an entirely different footing form the former proposal of general cooperation. It is possible that tills has be n Imperfectly understood. I have made for the purpose of tne proposal as regards the penal zakat a very careful study of the date trade. You state that dhows would not clear for Oman ports but for Arab or Persian ports in the neighbourhood. But tne iatee are being exported from Oman ports. The only dated exported to India are dry dates, which form about sixty per cent of the date export from Oman. The remaining forty per cent are wet dates and are exported all over tne world, mostly to America. These dates (dry) are unique and are known averywhere as Omani dates in the trade. Of these dates some 80 to 90^ go to Bombay and th^ rest to Karachi. None go to otner small Iniian ports wnere they are unsaleable. , All tant is necessary is for tne Indian Customs to see that cargoes of Omani dajces arriving at Bombay or* Karachi are accompanied by a pass from the Oman Customs. Thai will entail no extra work upon them and is &amp; very simplematter. It ia matter of complete inilf erence where the dates come from If they are Omani dates. In addition they will only come from Oman ports. I have made the most careful inquifriee on these points and opinion is unanimous that any attempt tuat will be made at smu^elin^ dry dates will be made direct to iac* India « There Is no chance of the complicated method of shipment to another Arab state or Persian port beiR&amp; resorted tc first. If one dhow arrives at Bombay without the necessary certificate and its carso is confiscated there will be m end tc all smuggling. As regards such action being a restraint on trade that is admitted, but thi* is a common situation all over the world at present, and in this case it is temporary and for a very clear and Justifiable purpose. I would also point out that as regards restraints on trade with regard to the Gulf ports the boot is very much on the other leg. It is by such states as Muscat who suffer most aeverly xxxxigxx&amp;t the restraints on trade imposed by the Indian Government, The Muscat has also lately been asked to cooperate in the restrictive system imposed with regard to the export of rice from India. The Muscat state has every right to demand tha like assistance from the India Government. For the export of wet dates we rely on the monopolistic character of the trale, and In consequence te5.ng able to establish a fairly effective local control at the ie* important points. The Khole of the present plan for solving the Oman problem is based on this very small amount of cooperation In checking the smuggling of dry dates to India. Should this cooperation not be forthcoming, and should the scheme fail, it will at least be quite clear why it failed. It is for this reason that I respectfully urge your reconsideration of this question. I wou^i add that I have been approached by all the British merchants connected with the late trade urging that the Indian customs be asked to cooperate in the prevent!onnofsnuggling* If tnls 13 lone they state they fear no damage of any kind to their interests, anl they are emphatic that the very announcement of cooperation or exemplary action in one case will be auite sufficient* The paragraph in the proclamation anent confiscation h s been taken in many quarters to mean that confiscation wi^l be made in India, ani this is useful* A definite notification from me on the subject would however havo an astonishing effect I nave Uie uonour to be Sir your nosy obedient servant Political Agent, Muscat I.C.S.CONFIDENTIAL British Consulate ani Political Agency Muscat 4th June 1920 To The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad* MEMORANDUM ( 1 ) The Hazm Incident Please refer to my memorandums No.840 date! the 17th April ani No.896 dated the 26th April. The following is a full report of the Hazm incident. It is given in cohsiderable detail as its importance can scarcely he overestimated as marking the extraordinary change i the Oman sit .atlon which has occurred in the last few months, and as confirming^ the opinion expressed as to the extent the Imam is losing ground and aa to the powerlessness of his party and of the tribes in general. D ring the month of March Sheikh Nasir bln Rashid al Ghafiri, paramount chief of the Beni Ghafir living in the Wadi Beni Ghafir, gave protection to certain robbers. Nasir bin Rashid al Kharusi, the brother f the Imam and his wall in Rostaq, demanded the surrender of these robbers from the Ghafiri sheikh. The latter refused on the usual Arab plea of asylum. The result was an open quarrel between the two. The Imam himself intervened on the side of his brother and at least two tribal meetings were called by him to settle the question, but the Ghafiri sheikh proved obdurate. Meanwhile Anmed bin Ibrahim of Hazm had been making himself very objectionable to the Imam and his brother Nasir B n Rashid al Kharusi, as has been already peported over the questions of the Yal Saad and the slave dealers who had taken refuge with the Kharusi. The Ghafiri seized tills opportunity to ent^r into an alliance with Ahmed bin Ibrahim, ani on the occasion of the visit of the wazir to Masnaah sent his son and another of his shetkhs to Masnaah and concludedan agreement with the Sultan’s governnent. This ieliberate provocation on the part of ,% ahmei bin Ibranim and the Ghafiri sheikh could only have one result, and Nasir bin Rashid al Kharusi at once attacked Hazm, while his brother the Imam sent out letters to rouse the tribes to punish the Ghafiri sheikh. The fort of Hazm is almost impregnable In Arab warfare. It however suffers from a very deficient water supply, while the town or Hazm depends for its water sup ly on a falaj which can be easily cut by an opposing force. The Kharusi had at once done tills. Ahmed bin Ibrahim the efore seeing that he had little chance of opposing the Kharusi without help, and that the Ghafiri would likewise not assist him in spite of their promises unless they were certain to win succeded in making his way to Muscat and asked help from the Sultanas government. As the situation had now developed into an actual attack on the Sultan's territory and an almost certain attack on the coast if the attack on Hazm should prove successful, the wazir at once prepared a small expedition la Masnaah to relieve Hazm. At the same time I took the opportuni -ty of visiting Masnaah in H.M.S.Clio wiiich was in Muscat. The wall of Matrah was put in command of the expedition and to aid to his prestige and In accordance with our undertaking to support the Sultan on the coast, I took the wall with me on the Clio. The actual force originally assembled at Iviasnaah by the wall only consisted of about 100 men with a couple of machine guns,, both men and guns being quite unreliable. The opposing force was said to number about 400, comprising the Beni Harras, the Beni Hina, the Abriyin and some others. The wall at once entered into negotiations with the Beni Harras and the latter possibly convinced that we were behind the Sultan deserted the Kharusi in a body and returned to their homes. I returned with the Clio to Muscat after 36 hours at HasnaahTiie « T all T s next move was to cllect more men through the walls of the coast towns anl to sen! a letter to Naslr bln Hash!l al Ghafiri asking for his help# The messenger however at once took the letter to JtxaNaslr bln Rashll al Kharusl. Thsl though quite unforseen turned out to be exceedingly fortunate, ^he Kharusl with exaggerated reports of the force at Masnaah, and realising that If the Beni Ghafir Joined In against him he at od a good chance of losing Kostaq, at one wrote to the Ghaflrl sheikh offering to make peace with him on any terms. He was certainly confirmed in his decision by the fact that the Imam had been trying to rouse the tribes against hafcfe both Ahmed bin Ibrahim and the Sultan on the plea of a Jehad, only to be met with excuse or direct refusal in every case. The terms demanded by the Beni Ghafir were complete immunity from all taxation by the Imam, and the return of a garden seized by the brother of the Imam, while in return they promised not to attack the Inam. These terms were accepted by the Imam. In tne meantime the defenders of Hazm, among whom was Hamud bin Suleiman one of the Ghafiri sheikhs, had been e suffring severely from lack of water, and had entered into negotiatlons*with All bin Hllal bin Dhahir, chief of the Beni Hina section of the beseigers. The latter allowed the defendee to get water under a semi undertaking that the Masnaah force would not attack them. The besfelgers still however continued to invest Hazm. On the 22nd May sufficient men were collected in Masnaah, and Ahmed bin Ibrahim taking with him some 300 men and ammunition anl stores advanced to Hazm. He entered the fort without encountering opposition, and from there advanced to Shebeika, the nearest water supply which was held by the Beni Hina. These fled at his approach to Hosheil held by Nasir bin Rashid al Kharusi and the head of the falaj supplying Hazm, where they inv Ived this section of the beselg rs also in their panic, and the whole fled to Rostaqwhere they iisporsed. Alined bin Ibrahim was anxious to push home the attack to Rostaq, but the attitude of his men appeared doubtful* He is however in undisputed possession of ohebeika and Hosheil and his men are buoy repairing the water courses. On tills successful relief of Hazm the wall of Matrah dismissed the tribes and returned to Muscat witn his men. The effects of this affair may be summed up as follow^ (1) The Imam openly proclaimed Ills intention to take Hazm and to punish Ahmed bin Ibrahim. He was compelled to withdraw with every appearance of ignominy, as on the approach of a very small force of the Sultan’s everybody deserted him. (3) The Imam openly proclaimed his intention of punishing the Beni Ghaflr. Instead he was compelled to ask peace from them and to accept the most humiliating terms, the Beni Ghafir in no way guaranteeing to help him, but only not to attawk him (3) The Imam openly proclaimed a holy war, only to be met by direct refusal and excuse. (4) For the first time for many years the Sultan*sgovernment has achiev d an open success against the Imam. The reasons for this somewhat remarkable resufc are fairly clear. The Omanis have no long r any offensive power ( as an instance of this cartridges are now ten to the dollar in Oman )• They ar^ thoroughly weary of a state of affairs in which they suffer without gaining any advantage whatever. They are aware through a fairly extensive propaganda that their sufferings are entirely due to the unreasonable attitude of the Imam and his brother over the affair of the gardens. They are becoming more convinc d every day that we are determined to back the Sultan. They are terrified of the possibilities of the penal zakat. Only one other point arises from this affair and that is the absolute necessity of supplying the Sultan with soi; reliable troops as soon as possible. With 300 good men nis autnority will be unquestioned throughout Oman.The Residency, Bushire, 9 th June 1920. Your demi-official letter dated 22nd Kay (received 6th June) regarding possibility of reprisals by Omanis. I think you are right that it is extremely improbable that the Omanis will attempt any attack on Kuttra or Muscat again. They have no stomach for anything of tho sort since their effort in 1911, or 1912 was it? It will be a good thing if you can get your Levy Corps ready made en bloc from Seistan: I rather doubt these up country Baluchis or Brahuis (if the Seistan Ooros i^s up country Baluchis) staying at Muscat long - but perhaps thoy might come for a year or so while other men from the 'G-armsir' as they call the coast district (and rightly) in Persia. Niedemayor or one of the German swaslx/bucklers in Persia during the war said he could go all through the country with 200 men and a couple of mountain guns, and he or some of his confreres was as good as his word. I suggested that the -J- Regiment at Muscat should find Jask and Oharbar garrisons because if the Regin nt here found them it would have reduced our strength here too much while the rebel Khans are 'in'being 11 . However a proposal has been made on other grounds to raise the overseas strength of the Regiment temporarily (there is no difficulty about it as there are about 400 men eating their heads off at the depot), and so I have wired to Foreign sugg sting that if any increase is made an additional 100 men may be thrown in so as to provide men for these two detachments. If this is done, it will get rid of the difficulty of the long picquet line. To My R*E.L.Wingate, Esqr. I.G.S., . Political Agent, Muscati My own idea coincides with yours that our plan is to do what we can to make the Sultan strong and respected, and although he never could and does not expect to exercise direct rule over the interior, I see no reason why the tribes should not recognize him as the paramount Ruler in Oman: and if he once gets his finances in order and has a mobile little striking force I think they v ry soon will do so. \NO. 177-S of 1920 British Residency and Consulate-General, Eushire, 8th June 1920. To The Political Agent, Muscat. Sir, I have the honour to reply to your letter no.1140 dated 26th May 1920 on the subject of co-operation between the Indian Customs Department and the Muscat Customs Department. Thecomment anent this made in my note dated 19th April, which formed the enclosure to my letter no.155-S dated 14th May, was intended to refer to the general question and was not intended to refer to any specific arrangements regarding penal zakat. It was in fact a comment on the paragraph of your note at the bottom of the 6th page in the typewritten copy made at in the Foreign and Political Department, which runs:- w In view of the lay coast line and the great difficulty in 'controlling smuggling I have repeatedly urged co-oneration 'between the Indian and Oman Customs. Dhows should not be 'permitted to clear from Indian to Oman ports except under 'guarantee which will not be released until a certificate has 'been received from the Oman Customs that the duty has been 'paid. This will have an astonishing effect on the Omanis 'and the more recalcitrant ports ; in addition to increasing the 'revenue, immediate orders are solicited on this pronosal'. This obviously referred to your previous proposal of general co-operation between the departments with which I could not agree, and I therefore again deprecated it. I did not realize that there was any separate proposal in regard to the zakat question and the exrort of dates.I do not see any objection to the proposal for the co operation of the Indian Customs Department to assist His High ness’s Government in enforcing the penal zakat. In fact I considered it a good proposal and will address the Government of India on the subject. All that is necessary is that the Customs atiithorities at Bombay and Karachi should be asked to detain and not allow to be cleared all cargoes of dates brought from Oman unless the nakhuda can produce a certificate that the zakat duty has been paid, and if such certificate is not produced within a specified time to confiscate the cargo; and in the case of dates imported by steamer not to permit the consignee to clear them till he has produced a similar certificate. Possibly Omanis may try and export via Debai or other ports on the Trucial Coast, but in the majority of cases I fancy the cost of carriage would be prohibitive, and in any case if the Customs authorities in India understand that the order refers to all dates known as Omani dates, this would be guarded against as would also the possibility of Omanis shipping to ports on the Persian Coast like Jask Charbar Gwadur etc and re-exporting from there. It is possible that merchants at these places may see a chance of profit and buy Omani dates for re-exoort to India, so I am asking the Assistant Superintendents of Telegraphs at these places to inform traders that Omani dates should not be purchased unless the Owner or nakhuda of the boat can produce a certificate from the ''uscat Customs that zakat has been paid, and that in the event of the dates being re-exported to India such certificate must accompany them otherwise the consignment may be confiscated.

Please refer to ay telegrams Nos.1396 and 1400 date d the 36th and the 3dth June respeotlyely on the situation In Interior Oman. News and rumours are at present so confliet- -ing that it is Impossible to give an accurate summary of the situation. Two undoubted facts however emerge clearly, (1) The Omanis at last realise that the penal xakat is a real thing and that they will be these who suffer, and that unless they take some steps they will be powerless to avoid it. (3) They are in the greatest state of confuslcar in consequence and are endeavouring to find a way out. A definite meeting was summoned at Semail, but the Imam possibly realising that the weight of YvN** opinion would be so strongly against that he would be compelled to come to terms, ditf not encourage it. At the sahie time Isa bin Salih aiiB Suleiman bin Hamyar refused to come. People attribute their refusal to their knowledge of the attitude of the Imam and their fear of a refusal. This is typical of the present state Of Oman politics. Ths sheikhs of the Beni Bu All have written to Sheikh Isa urging a ee$$lement, considerable pressure is being brought to bear on Suleiman bln Hamyar the titular chief of the Ghafirls by various sections to settle the matter. The latter is sail to have written to the Imam asking • ■'*' give back the gardens and come to an agreement and so free him from the zakat, or if he wishes io fight on the question then to arrange for all the expenses of histribe«ra«n and they will help him(the Imam). Failing either of these alternatives the Ghafiris will seek a solution them- •selves. The question of fighting is said to have been propounded beacuse it is well known that the Imam has nothing in his treasury, and that therefore it is an impossibility. It is reported that several sections are refusing to pay zakat to the Imam on the grounds that they cannot pay him and also pay the 25^. There is no apprehension of an attack by the Omanis on Muscat and Matrah. It must not be forgotten however that an attack is a possibility, purely as prelude to an agreement, if they wurthink that there is no other way and have not the moral courage to act against the Imam* Little danger is anticipated from the strongest attack the Omanis could execute. The O.C. at Beit-al-FalaJ is being kept fully informed of all movements by me from such information as I am able to collect. I.C.S Political Agent, Muscat. Cop$ to The Civil Commissioner, BaghdadTelegram P. From Political Muscat To Political Bushire No.1401 iated 8/7/20. Sheikh Isa has sent me a letter which arrived today in which he asks whether the British G-overnmant have published the recent proclamation. I have reliable information which goes to show that Isa was addressed by the Sharkiyah tribes who pointed out to him that the acts of those who had seized the property had caused these steps to be taken agains# them, that this property did not benefit them atall and that therefore Isa should take steps to solve the difficulty. Isa temporised and promised to address the ?,A. in the first Instance. It is a significant fact that after the events of last February Isa should have been compelled to address me. An immediate reply seating clearly ourposition is I think essential. It would be necessary to show in this letter quite conclusively that we are backing the Sultan absolutely. Care would be taken in the wording so thht Government would not in any way be committed beyond their engagements. The Omanis do not yet entirely believe that we will support the Sultan, and Isa had previously written to Sheikh Said bin Nasir that did he know that Govt, desired the return of the property it might be done. It is therefore possible that such action may bring about a decision A summary of the proposed letter is being telegraphed later.Telegram P. From Political Muscat To Political Bushire No.1493 late! 9/7/20. 1. The proclamation which orders punishment on the Omanis for the lotting of private property has been issued by the Sultan'3 government. 2. The British Government will support the Sultan fully in accordance with the terms of their engagements with him as they are in alliance with him. 3. The British Government had at last mediated at the request of the Omanis, and before that had used their good offices to see that hardships were not Imposed on the tribes. The tribes had however refused to ratify the terms first agreed to, and Governusnt could not interfere again on their behalf as they had prov d themselves untrustworthy to deal with, but would of course support #he Sultan in accordance with the terms of their engagements. 4. Government has notified their subjects as regardd the Muscat proclamation which they have agreed to. 5. If the Sheikhs so wish tne P.A. will however meet them at Sib before the 15th August as Government is still ready to exercise its good offices for settlement, but should the property in question not be first returned the P.A. will no meet them. A strong letter is necessary, and it will frighten the Omanis and strengthen the Sultan’s hand even if it does not have an immediate effect. I should be therefore glad of your views by telagraph as the letter should be sent before the 15th July.From, 't&lt; The Officer Coimand + Troops -.uscat. A' C/S/T-J „ I ? /j 7' ' #ro,.

But we do not know its source, whether It is from you and with your order or whether It Is Issued of their own accord. For the British Government Is praiseworthy for Justice 5 - 18 not In their nature to act without any reason. But if the reason, as is mentioned In the proclamation in the matter of the gardens, they were only taken with the Fatwa of ths Shara by the religious alims and not as tne writer &gt;'-. *» l n his proclamation. According to your laws you do not enter Into religious matters. But If It is neither from you nor with your order, then Inform us so that the Omanis may '.. a. over ths matter. ?ue proclamation Is sent herewith and salTrtnolation of a letter late! the 3?th Snawwal (14th July) from the political Agent and H.B.M’s Conaul,Muscat to Siiellch laa bln Salih al Harlthi• I recalvel yoim lat»b0X , laid th© 12t.h r»ha*&lt;^al anl I unierr&gt;t#IAl what it contalnel namely that you aa 3 ? ’°' 1 v 'hom haa corae the proclamation wliich you enoloBe.

It Is known to you that with the Government of H*H* the Sultan, the great and glorious aovenuaant is on terns of sincere friendship and ic bound with him with many writ on agreements* J4y Government will render all the support and assistance necessary and possible to H• H 1 S Oovemment in accordance with their agreements with that Government* The substance of these agreements has raoro than once b en written anl explained to you* It is known t you also that for many years past my Government lias exercised their good offices on your behalf and has more than once advised the Government of the Sultan not to take severe measures against you. Finally at your request my Government agreed to mediate between the Government of H.H. the Sultan ani the Oman tribes, which mediation took place at Sib in the month of Haj last year. The Oman tx*ibee however who had expressed through you agreement refused to ratify the tenas. In this case therefore they proved themselves Insincere ani unfit to be dealt with by a Just and truo government. Ify Government therefore can no longer exorclso their good offices on bohalf of the Oman tribes, nor will they take any action to mitigate the evils whloh must befall them from the Sul f &lt;an v s govemmnt because of their misdeeds* On the contrary they are supporting fcfemH*H* the Sultan in accordanceare well known to you. My Goverrunent ha» asreei to the action of th# Government of H.H. the Sultan In the case of the penal zakat ani has published a notification to their own subjects to thla effect, which fact shouli be well known to you. As you yourself know my Government never interfere in religious matters. The Great ani Glorious Goverruaent has always been anxious for the peace ani prosperity of Oman ani that the present unsatisfactory state of affairs shoull cease. Therefore in spite of the inslacre action of the tribes over the Sib negotiations, if fully authorised representatives of the tribes of Oman meet the Political Agent at Sib before the 16th August ani return the property which they have psssessid, ani should they listen to the advice of the Political Agent, the Politioaj Agert on behalf of the Great ani Glorious Government will sxerolss his good offices to procure a lasting agreement. The Political Agent will however not interfere in any way and will hold no discussion unless this property is first returned, as after what has occured it is impossible for the British Govemmnt to trust the sincerity ani the good will of the Omani tribes unless they should show clearly their good and peaceful intentions.British Residency and Consul at o-0 eneral, Bushire, 1st July 1920.

His return would not affect the attitude of the tribes and the . . t local government which is conducting the negotiations with ability is not anxious for his return at tnis stage. When I last saw the Sultan he had place . the whole matter in my hands There is a possibility of a settlement of the whole Oman problem within the next fortnight. Should this come off my position in dealing with the Sultan will be far stronger. I cannot leave Muscat during this period as if the tribes want a settlement it will be necessary for me to act as a witness finally, pending the result of the negotiations I shall have i to postpone my visit to India for a short time.From Britlftfi Rdsl&amp;onoy and oonsjalato^Oer.oral, Bushlro, Blst July 19B0« I&lt;I^ut-.Ool , A^P.’rrovor, C#I.E*, Dop-ity Political Resident| poralan Gulf* Vo *hn Hon # Mo Hr.

Britiah influence h*r throughout hi been entirely selflntereeted, it has paid no regard to the peculiar political and social conditions of the country and its rulers, and by bribing quite inadequately effete Sultana to Impose unpalatable measures which benefitted noone but ourselves, and premittlng them to misrule without protest, has done more to alienate the interior, and to make the local government incapable of improving the situation, thiin alii t rest put together. The result was that when I came here the gev mment was getting into debt at the rate of two lakhs a year, they had not a single soldier and not a man upon whoathey couli rely, anlwere eimply Havel by the presence of our Tory expensive troop* at Muscat* Weil the result of a iifferent policy is rather surprising. Take first of all the actual administrative affai* of the Sultanate. I consider the financial reorganisation to have started from the 1st October 1919* On the 31st July 1930 that is with two of the nost profitable months of the finanoia year atill to run, the treasury shows a balance of Just over Hs*180000/* t an! there Is still Ws.30000/* from the Nuralbahr to come in. That is assuming the usual monthly recurring expenditure at the end of the financial year there should be a balance of over two lakhs* If we take off from this 1S.5000U for a motor cruiser and Re.50C00/* for the initial expense** cf the leJky you see that the state will still have a balance of a lakh, that is over one year’s instalment of the debt to the 0 of I* It is not a bad record if you consider the conditions of tills place and remember that w# started from absolutely nothing, and the state has proved itsself enable of meeting its debt charges and also of heavy initial exx&gt;enditure as well As regards other matters my quaint system of Justice has proved an astounding success. Cases are disposed quite rapidly and fairly Justly, and many people cone fron Jtfie inter , capable -ior to get their canes settled* The only approximately men in the state are now at the head of affairs* Once the levy arrives and the government has this visible and reliable power of its own, the state can be almost left to work out its own salvation provided there is a perman ent regency council to govern during the Cultan’s what I imagine to be almost continuance in India* Now what about the int rlor. They at least were perfectly aware of our stupidity, and proceeded to enjoy life ant bluff ua tothmlrhearts content, and apparently to ours aswell. How if it wa« poaeibl* to roor&amp;mito tlie state ani to make it capable of standing on its own logs without continual propping fron us, it obviously did not in the least what they did and what happened there as tine was on tne side of t* Sultan 1 s govenunent. Point was added to this by ay knowledge of the practical powsrlessnoss of the Omani* and of their growing discontent. Though the Sultan could not at the noaent establish by force of anas his authority over the interiofrp and indeed even if he could do this in tue future it Is v ry doubtful if it la worth his while, he could at least show that he would stand no nonsence wnsre In cases of flagrant injus- -tice and could v ry effectively retaliate, I therefore proposed the penal ft&amp;kat, and was very careful to get the' proclamation so worded as to saake it absolutely clear even to the wild Omanis why it was imi*sed« Then things began to hap en. First of all the Ctaanis thought that we would nev r allow it, having in alnd our futile attitude when the Sultan last imposed the measure, and they approached the bunnlas on the subject, only to bo told that thore was nothing doing. Then the storm began to brew. Influential Omanis ap roach -X the Xnam to act sensibly but the evil influence of his brother Nasir bin Rashid in whose hands the garden* were, stultified all their efforts, Nasir bin Rashid already unpopular became detested, and some of the odium began naturaly to fall, on the Iwaa himself. Finally Sheikh Isa who had been treated very brusquely by me was compelled by popular opinion to address me I seised upon this opportunity to oxplaln our position clearly in my rc*ly. At the saiae time I took car# that the terms of this reply should be perfectly well known even before it ws actually sent. On the night of the Slat July the Imam was murdered. The exact details of his aurd not known, bututterly alok of hia rulo &amp;n$ that of hla brothora', which wa* a coatoination of utter roll&amp;loua bigotry combined with ehame- leae aelfiahneaa ani oppreaaion and a comploto ^lare^ard of politica or government, all of which in aidltion to their own inherent diaadvantagea were resulting in the injoeition of all aorta of trying restrictions from the Sultan’s goverruaent, culminating in the penal zakat. Now was the chance for tlie Sultan’s government , It waa peouliarly fortunate at this moment that Macoollum was on leave* Had he been here it would have been impossible for the lowal government to have acted without it being regarded as certain that we behind any effort that they would make, a thing that we are certainly not, for the simple reason that It does not matter in the least aa by the strengthening of the Saltan’s government matters will automatically adjust themselves, arid ve cann afford to wait, and beoause it is not our policy to mix ourselves up in the affairs of the interior* At the same ti^e an attitude of complete aloofness left it still open for the Omanis to approach us if they wanted to* The tribos undoubtedly expected the local w ove vinent to aot, and quite a number sent tentative offers of allegiance* The local government then acted, but they did not act quite fast enough* With the years of imbecility of Faisal Taiaur, and of treachery and vacillation behind thea they did not realise Napoleon's famous dictum on the moral and the material, that they had only to send a representative with a very few men to Seuail and the tiling was done, it did not need force ot even a show of force, it only needed a bold front, taoy delayed two days while they thought that t ey were making ire* Tiie result was taat Isa, as I had told them was probable Jumped in with ills move, and the Qazl of Muscat within a few miles of 8email was met by the Sheikhs who had ask-’ - 00130 w lth the statement that he .iad arrived toofour hours Sheikh Ism’s move is an affort to retain power/ the naiie on an Imam for himself* He knows well enough th the Sultan’s authority reestablished, with the collapse rebellion he would sink to the status of a petty sheikh if worse did not befall him* He was enabled to secure the nominal election of an Imam because of the small delay and because the local s©vemi.ent could not show any power* He ha actually I believe only fifty men with him, but the loesl government have not one upon whom they can rely* Still even now Isa’s difficulties are far from ov The Imam whom he hnn nominated is .iuham. el bin Abdullah al Khali 11, chief of the Ban! Ruwaha, a Hinawi tribe, and father in law os Isa himself* Whether the Ohaflri fact! acknowledge him la quite a different matter, especially is so intimately connected with Isa* Even if they shew .. * will be a very different Imamship fron the last* The Kharusl was elected as the result of an elaborate by every sheikh in Oman personally canvassed by the famous blind Skelkh al Salim with every factor, religious enthusiasm ani the oppression and mlsgovemnent of Faisal behind him* Everybody knows that this is a dynastic offort on Isa’s part, and is purely a patchwork where the other was a well woven garment* It regard* with complete indifference, and most of Oman will desert him with the Increase of the Sultan’s power* It was for toils reason that when I realised Uw the local government’s game would not succeed for tue moment that I suggested tiiat I sh uld go to India for a f**w days to settle up the long overdue question of the v attitude towards tho events of the last fortnif v x complete indifference, as this case of heads I win tails yov have their flinghave bean a great coup for thaa # if the/ failed it would be only temporarily and would not matter a damn as long &amp;&amp; nothing to do with it,* and our Indifference would still leave the way open for the Omanis to approach ue if they wanted to. Incidentally if only the a of I had only replied to ay almost tearful intreatles to fix up something about the Sultan, either by a Council of Regency with him residing often in India, or with his abdicating. It does not matter which, in my own mind I have nod doubt that Oman would have corae in. The new socalled Inam is for the Arabs both learned and intelligent. He had backed up Sai* bin Naslr al Kindi in his mission at the end of last year. It seeras clear that he already realises that his position if it is to exist atall depends on his ability to remove tho penal aakat. He has therefore already addressed al Kindi apparently in the hope of opening up negotiations through me on the basis of the return of the gardens. If he does do so again our position is perfect- -ly clear, the letter to Isa has been acknowledged but not yet properly answered. They may take it oh leave it. Should they wish to see me they may do so but they must return the gardens first, and I will then square up something with them.
