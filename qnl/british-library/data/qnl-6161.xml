As the scheme to send the trawler to Arabian waters apjjears to have been abandoned for the time being, no immediate action is required, but we think that it would be as well to consider at this stage what steps are required to protect Arab interests if the need should arise in the future. In this connection we have been looking at the suggestions and comment? contained in Seal's letter No,M.04446/37 of the 13th November, and in particular the question of the legal powers which His Majesty's ships would require. The question to be decided first is whether His Majesty's Government would approve the use of force by His Majesty's ships to prevent encroachment by foreigners on the Arab pearl fisheries. As regards the recognition by international law of the rights to be protected difficulty arises only in connexion with the pearling banks outside territorial waters. The Law Officers, when the matter was referred to them in 1905, considered that as a matter of international law the pearl banks are capable of being the property of the Arab tribes to the exclusion of all nations, but they reached the general conclusion that it is not expedient to raise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalities from fishing on the banks. r Ie note from Baggallay's letter to Clauson No.E.7681/12/34 of the 8 th January 1937, (on the subject of the prospective v’isit of a Danish fishing expert to the T. V. Brenan, Esq., O.B.S., Foreign Office, S.W.l. Persian/2 . Persian Gulf) that in Beckett's view prescriptive rights may be obtained to exploit the bed of the open sea for the purposes of pearl fisheries, etc. Is it the present view of the Foreign Office that the existence of Arab rights on the pearling banks outside territorial waters could be successfully upheld, e.g. before an international tribunal, if forcible action by one of His Majesty's ships for the protection oi those rights were challenged by a foreign power? No doubt we should, and would, use first all other means short of actual force to keep intruders out, but unless we are prepared to use force in the last resort we need not pursue the question of securing the necessary legal powers for His Majesty's ships, so far as relates to action outside territorial waters? whether forcible action by the Navy should in this connexion be limited to territorial waters or should extend to the pearling banks lying outside those limits we are inclined to think that the necessary powers might be provided by inducing all the Arab Rulers concerned to issue a proclamation, or carry out an exchange of letters with the political authorities, to the effect that pearl fishing by other than Arab vessels is forbidden by them, and that His Majesty's Government are authorised to take any necessary measures on their behalf to compel the removal of foreign vessels engaged in pearl fishing within their territorial waters (and on the pearling banks outside those limits). Owing to the difficulties raised by the common ownership of all the Arab Shaikhs in the pearling banks and the absence of suitable courts, or of the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction by His Majesty, in all the Sheikhdoms it hardly seems profitable to consider at present the possibility of further measures such as the arrest and trial of offenders? But the matter might be further considered if and when jurisdiction/jurisdiction is exorcised by His Majesty on the Trucial Coast under an Order-in-Council. Before considering the matter further and consulting the Political .Resident vie should be grateful if you would let us have your views. I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal. Yours sincerely 5 (Sgd.) J. P. Gibson.P. Z. 1008/38 E. 48/4 8/91 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 11th February, 1938. Dear Gibson, I write in reply to your letter No. P.Z.8426/37 of the 1st January to Brenan, who is away on leave, about the measures to be taken with regard to possible future encroachment by foreigners on the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf. 'O. ihis question has now been carefully examined in consultation with Beckett, and our general view of the position is as follows. 3. There appear to be two questions involved. The first is whether Piis Majesty’s ships can be authorised to use force if necessary to prevent encroachment by foreigners on certain pearling banks which lie in the eastern waters of the Persian Gulf at more than three miles from the shore, ou 6 to which we consider that the Arab rulers under our protection on the western shore of the Persian Gulf have acquired an exclusive right for their respective nationals. As the use of the Navy to force foreign ships to leave the banks may cause representations to be made by the Powers concerned, tne answer to this question depends in part upon whether we consider that we have sufficiently good legal grounds for claiming that the Arab rulers have acquired these rights for their subjects under international law. This point in turn depends upon two propositions:- (a) The proposition that it is possible to acquire an exclusive right to sedentary fisheries on defined banks beneath the high seas (a question of pure law) (b) the proposition that in fact the Arab rulers have acquired this right. 4. As regards (a), Beckett has observed that the bulk of English writers on international law (vide Westlake and Oppenheim)/ . P. Gibson, Esq.6 ./ 2 . yd Oppenlieim) appear to accept this .proposition; the Law Officers of 1905 also did so. If it is considered worth while a more extensive search could be made into all the available books on the subject, including those by foreign writers as well as English writers (particularly the French writer Gidel) and anything that may be available in the proceedings of the League of Nations codification work would have to be taken into account. Beckett considers that the result would probably show the balance of authority to be in favour of the proposition, but that it is impossible to say that the question is free from doubt. 5. As regards (b), the question depends upon our ability to show that, in fact, an exclusive enjoyment of the fisheries by the subjects of the Arab rulers has existed over a long period, and that the rulers have maintained their right, with or without British assistance, v/henever it has been challenged. In other words, it would be necessary to show that, although an occasional trespasser may have been let through, trespassers have as a general rule been effectually warned off. The Law Officers in 1905 appeared to feel that they had not been quite sufficiently informed on this aspect of the matter, although on the whole they considered their case to have been adequately proved. We have no further information, but imagine that it could be shown that between 1905 and the present day the position has not -worsened in this respect. At the same time, -we think that it would be very desirable to obtain more detailed information on this aspect of the matter, and we should be grateful if the India Office could furnish us with the necessary material. Meanwhile, for the sake of the argument which follows, I ill proceed on the assumption that we could show a good cas j on this aspect of the question also.3. 6 . Assuming that the answers to the two propositions defined in paragraph 3 would be found to be as I have described them above, the result of action by His Majesty’s ships might be that, v/hile we should have a reasonably good legal case, such action might lead to international representations. It may not however be possible to keep trespassers off by other means, and if trespassers are not effectually kept off the legal right claimed would be weakened. Consequently, we are inclined to think that the right policy would be to allow” His Majesty's ships to act forthwith in any case where circumstances demand it, and to leave it to those who object to try to prove their case, if % they can, as plaintiffs before an international tribunal. 7. The second of the questions mentioned in paragraph 3 concerns the provision of the necessary legal powers for such action as may be considered desirable. If His Majesty’s ships are to act as proposed above, it will be necessary to invest them with specific authority to do so under some form of municipal law. Beckett considers that this authority must be derived from the rulers of the Arab States, but that, as these rulers do not cossess jurisdiction over foreigners, or over all classes of foreigners, their proclamations or legislation should be supplemented by Kingte Regulations made under the various Orders in Council under which His Majesty's Government exercises ex-territorial jurisidction in the Persian Gulf. The procedure required would seem to be that proclamations or laws should be issued by the Arab rulers, reciting that the fisheries have long been reserved to their nationals, and that other persons have always been forbidden to fish there by law: and then going on to state that in order that there should be no doubt on the point, the prohibition of other persons from exploiting the fisheries is now/*) 4. now declared over a^ain and that poachers or trespassers T will he liable to certain penalties, and may be arrested by the authorities of the Arab ruler in question or by the authorities of the protecting Power acting upon the ruler's request. 8 . King's Regulations would then be made to which the Arab proclamations would be annexed, making enforceable the Arab rulers’ proclamations on British subjects and foreigners, and authorising His Majesty’s ships to take action against poachers and trespassers. In the case, however, of a ruler like the Sheikh of Bahrein, who has no jurisdiction over any except his own nationals, it may be questioned whether there is any necessity for any legislation at all, and whether a King’s Regulation is not all that is required, since the only people aflected by the proposed legislation would be persons who are not subject to the Sheikh’s jurisdiction. In this case, a simple request from the Sheikh to His Majesty’s Government to legislate and to take action against the trespassers may perhaps be all that is required. 9. As regards the precise form of action to be taken by His Majesty's ships, Beckett observes that, while poachers and trespassers who enter the territories or territorial waters of the Arab states after their poaching activities could properly be arrested and prosecuted, it is rather doubtful whether His Majesty’s ships could legally bring them into territorial waters by force. In the case of poachers and trespassers who are not British subjects or British protected persons, therefore, it appears that action by His Majesty’s ships should be confined to driving them away, since, even admitting the soundness of the case for the appropriation of the fisheries on the bed of the sea, there would still be a technical legal difficulty as regards arresting such persons, m' 5. since they would presumably be caught at the surface of the sea, which cannot be appropriated and which must be admitted to be outside the jurisdiction of any State. 10. While I do not think we should see any objection to the enactment of the necessary municipal legislation and the issue of the appropriate instructions to His Majesty's ships, on the assumption that these measures are necessary to protect the pearl fisheries (and assuming that the answers to propositions (a) and (b) can be confirmed), I think the point ought to be considered whether the threat to the fisheries from Japanese or other quarters is really serious, for clearly these measures will draw a lot of publicity to a question upon which little light beats at present. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Lacy Baggallay.Confidential. Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. D.O.No.C/266 Bahrain, the 23rd April, 1^38 Will you please refer to the correspondence forwarded with India Office Printed Letter No.P.2.1008/38 of 24th February 1938 regarding Japanese Trawlers and Arab Pearling Banks. of 11th February 1938 to you one of the main technical difficulties concerns the provision of legal pov/ers for action by Kis Majesty's ships. As he himself remarks, the measures which he suggests might well draw a lot of publicity to a question which at present is fairly obscure. I am afraid I cannot claim any knowledge whatsoever of international law, and the suggestion below may, I fear, be quite useless, but at any rate it seems worth while mentioning it. 3. It is accepted, I think, that the pearl fisheries are the exclusive common property of all the Shaikhs, and this means that the subjects of any one Shaikh have the right at any time to fish at any place on any of the pearling banks. This being so their joint right to exclude outsiders is also a right enjoyed by each of them independently, and it seems to me that it might be possible to hold that a request from, a single Shaikh to His Majesty's Government to take action against poachers and trespassers would provide sufficient legal cover. The only apparent bar to this would 2 Judging from Baggallay's letter No. £.48/48/91 be/ J.P.Gibson, Require, The India Office London,0 L be a concession by one of the other Arab Shaikhs to a foreigner, but in view of the 1911 assurance, which they all gave, and in view of their obvious interests, it is unnecessary to apprehend any difficulty on this score. If this view can be accepted then it is unnecessary to look further than Bahrain for the necessary authority, and the whole thing can be kept quiet and tidy, with an authority in existence ready for use at any moment. 4. I am not touching at present on the other points raised in this correspondence but I merely put this suggestion forward as one possible labour-saving device. ♦ I am sending copies of this letter to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe and to the Political Agent, Bahrain.
