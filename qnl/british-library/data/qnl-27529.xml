His Highness has recovered from his last attack of bronchitis. He presided over three meetings of the Municipal Committee during the period under review and went for a Hawking trip from the 22nd to the 26th. 58. Reference paragraph 39 of the Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.3 of 1948. Shaikh Abdullah al Mubarak returned from Basrah on the 17th. 59. Recently Shaikh D’uaij As Salman has been competing with Shaikh Subah an Nasip in his dealings with Iraqi smugglers much to the latter’s distaste, and enmity between them has been growing. A few days ago a lorry from Zubair manned by three Zubairis, one of whom was a S’aduni, loaded with sugar belonging to D’uaij in Jahra and left for Iraq. It never arrived and no^trace of the crew, the lorry, or the sugar has been found. D’uaij has laid the offence publicily at the door of Subah and has promised to kill the latter if the men are not returned. Mean while, as Subah’s corpse would be of little value, he has helped himself to and sold - a lorry-load of Subah’s sugar. Both Shaikhs are festooned with weapons and followed by armed body guards. Subah has nev^r been really popular since he murdered his brother, and it is generally hoped that D’uaij shoots first and shoots straight. Subah is capable of anything, but it is not thought likely that he would have killed the Zubairis in cold blood, nor that he could have buried the lorry. Developments are awaited. Paragraph 60/---- (page2)^ LOCAL ^ f S . \ 60, The Kuwait Government have issued Commemorative labels bearing the likeness of the shaikh for the 27th anniversary of his accession as was done during last year. These labels have been distributed free for the public to stick to their letters. 61. The 27th anniversary of the accession of His Highness on the 23rd February, 1921 was observed as a nublic holiday. Ho receptions were held as His Highness was away from the town and had issued orders before his departure for the desert that the occasion should not be officially celebrated in view of the present conditions in Palestine. As a result the Kuwait Education Department had to cancel all the entertainments they had arranged for the occasion. 62. The British Broa^dl,Casting Corporation hex* announced in their morning Arabic Programme the news of the 27th anniversary of His Hirhness accession. The announcer after having offered the usual congratulations to His Highness and the Kuwaitis summed up the period of His Highness’ reign and praised His friendship with Great Britain. In the evening a special programme lasting for 20 minutes was broadcast from Cairo. The programme was prepared by the students of the Kuwait Hostel there and was introduced by one of the Egyptian announcers, who after congratulating His Highness and the Kuwaitis on this hapuy occasion handed over the microphone to Hamad Ru.ieib, acting warden of the Kuwait Hostel in Cairo. Hamad Rujeib read out a summary of Kuwait history from 1896 to 1948. This was followed by three songs by the Kuwaiti students in cairo. 63. , Mr. L. T. Jordan, the new General Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company arrived by air on the 21st accompanied by Mrs. Jordan and will take over from Nr.

Three lorries and a station wagon belonging to the Kuwait oil Company have recently been stolen by Iraqi drivers and are believed to have been taken into Iraq to be sold. 65. Mr. ^mile Bonstani a well known Lebanese Merchant arrived in his private plane on the 26th and left for Dhahran on the 28th* 66. The Customs Department has issued a new' order regarding demurrage charges. The time allowed for goods to remain in the Customs without charge is 14 days, after which the customs will charge demurrage of four annas a day per package whether large or small. This charge has been levied in order to compel the merdhants to ta^e delivery of their goods without delay as the existing godowns are not sufficient for storing the large quantities of goods now arriving. 67. The new road under construction from the sea-front to the town square has now progressed sufficiently for cars to pass through although it ha^ not yet been expanded to full-width throughout its length. 68* A handsome two-storied biiilding is under construction at the east end of the town to serve as offices of the Education Department and a new building to house the Kuwait Passport Office is under construction near the Office of Public Security.Pape 3 . 69, T h e nrices of essential .commodities have increased considerably. There is a ^rave shortage of wheat and the nrice went 110 at one time to Rs.80/- per bap of 140 Lbs. but subsequently dronned. to have their M Sky-hoo v ' in operation in a fortnipht. They have now 500 Americans at Has Misha^b, and the area they occupy is surrounded by an unscaleable fence 4 miles Ion( 7 . This, combined with occasional amputations, secures comparative freedom from pilferinp. 71. The clash between the Mutair (S.Arabia) and the Badur (Iraq) last year reference rarapraph 86 of the Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.7 of 1947 has piven rise to more theiving and peneral apprehension in the desert than is usual. A Harbi was recently robbed of all his possessions by the Dhafir (Iraq) in Saudi Arabia near Rirai, and two Badris are reported to have been seized and imprisoned in Kuwait as a reprisal for a theft of camels and sheep from the Awazein (Kuwait). The Mutrafiq generally have not dared to come further South than the latitude of Jahra although the be^t prazinp is on and beyond the Southern borders of Kuwait. rr To /-n O Vi o 4 T r- V'l 1 T 4 - ri d- In /~\ r'.

The Shaikh of Kuwait is the only Persian Gulf Ruler who has visited Ibn Saud recently and while it is quite probable that the activities of Jews in Palestine and counter-measures were freely discussed (vide correspondence connected with Residency Printed Lette r No. 1356-S, dated t he 18th July 1947) , you may wish to draw the attention of the B.B.C. to the fact that the statement broadcast was far from accurate. The B.B.C. has a high reputation for the reliability of their broadcasts, and for them to broadcast news which in the area to which it relates is so obviously known to be inaccurate is damaging to this reputation. s E.P.

Three Persian Army Bren guns were found washed up on the shores of Bubiyan and Failecha islands and the main land. The guns were boxed with spares and tools and were badly rusted. It is doubtful if the guns can be made serviceable. The Shaikh gave the finders Rs.100/- each. 158. Fire broke out in a dhow which was beached on the morning of the 4th.

RULING FAMILY . 141. Reference paragraph 132 of the Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1947. His Highness and party arrived in Kuwait by air on the 21 st and was met at the airfield by a large concourse of his relatives and subjects as also by the Political Agent and senior members of the European and American community. Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak had pitched and furnished large tents at the airfield several days before and, although the Shaikh was not due to leave Riyadh until the morning* he showed keenness by arriving the night before and sleeping on the spot. Shaikh Abdullah Salim was present but remained concealed in his car for two hours awaiting the plane and could not be persuaded to mingle with the throng. The Shaikh went in profession to the public Security Office where he was greeted by those of his subjects who had been unable to get to the airfield. An r Ardha ! was held the same day. Presents given by Ibn Saud to His Highness and his z&amp;t retinue also included a Ford.Station wagon and a ^ifle embossed with gold. His Highness gave the former to Shaikh Fahad as Salim and the latter to Shaikh Abdulla Mubarak. The shot-guns presented to His Highness by the Kuwait Oil Company in 1945 vide paragraph 375 of the Intelligence Summary for November 1945 were, it is believed given by him to Ibn Saud. Apart from the other presents the Shaikh was given a Slave-girl by one of the wives of Ibn Saud in grateful aupreciation of the Improvement in the Lord of Arabia f s __ temper during the Shaikhts sojourn in Riyadh. Izzat jaafar, the Shaikh*s Social Secretary also did some business on the side by buying a Chevrolet Saloon in Riyadh and selling it at a profit of Rs.2,500 in Kuwait. 142. The Shaikh suffered from high blood-pressure in Riyadh for which he was treated by Dr, Storm of the American Mission. He was some what inconvenienced by the fact that Ibn Saud does not aupear in public until 9.30 a.m. and, naturally, he had to conform, although it his normal practice to rise at 3.30 a.m. and deal with most of his affairs before 9.30. On the whole, whowever, the Shaikh appears to have benefitted by the change and to have acquired from the King*s society a new confidence and authority in dealing with his own relatives and subjects. 143. Shaikh Subah al Ahmad was married to the daughter of Shaikh Salman al Hamood as Subah on the 29th. SAFAR . 144. Nearly all the Kuwait Merchants fleet have returned. 139 craft left Kuwait at the openng of the season for India and Africa with a cargo of dates from Iraq and Gulf ports. Some dhows succeeded in making two trips. Four dhows are reported sunk owing to heavy/owing to heavy weather, one with a loss of all her crew and passengers numbering 55. The cargo brought from India consisted mostly of timber, charcoal, tamarind, cement,coir mats, and ropes. Fish oil and mangrove poles were brought in from Yemen and African ports. The highest income of a Sailor was Rs.400/- and the lov/est Rs.250/- which shows a decline as compared with last year. This is largely due to lower freight rates. Freight rates for 1945-1946 and 1946 - 1947 were as follows:- 1945- 1946 1946 - 1947 Basra - Karachi ” Bombay ” Aden Karachi-Kuwait Bombay-Kuwait Rs.5/8 per maund of 168 Lbs. Rs # 6/8 ' ' R s, 8 /- ' ' Rs. 6 /- per bag of Sugar. Rs.100/- per ton. Rs.5/- per maund of 168 Lbs. Rs. 6 /- » ' Rs,7/- ' ' Rs.5/- per bag of suga Rs.100/- per ton. The decline has probably been caused by the improved steamer service. ///. LOCAL NEWS . 145. 30th June marked the first anniversary of the export of oil from Kuwait and was observed as a holiday by the Kuwait Oil Company. In the afternoon an fArdha* was held and in the evening the Acting General Superintendent gave a dinner which was attended by His Highness and the political Agent. During the 12 months 1,750,000 tons of oil have been shipped in 136 tankers. 146. During the fortnight it was reported to the Security Department that some people were gambling in a cemetary. The place v/as raided and 14 people were caught while some managed to escape. The captives were flogged and released after two days detention in the prison, and after having been paraded round the town in chains. 147. On the 30th June Messrs Bray and Chattey of the Iraq Petroleum Company arrived with the news that a company lorry stolen from Margil was reported to be in the possession of Shaikh Subah an$ Nasir as Subah at jahra. After receiving the authorisation of the Shaikh (given unhesitatingly) Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak, the Political Agent and the Iraq petroleum company representatives raided the smuggler*s den at Jahra and broke open his garages. The lorry was not found there but it was discovered that a similar one had left the same day for Riyadh. Shaikh Abdullah left in pursuit and returned at dawn on the 1st July with the lorry which was identified and returned to the Iraq Petroleum Company on the spot. It is hoped that this incident will convince Kuwait’s neighbours that her authorities are not slow in taking decisive action even against members of the ruling family when they engage in activities discreditable to the State. It is also to be hoped that it will dispell the reputation as a bogey man which Subah an Nasir has enjoyed since he murdered his brother Abdullah, Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak’s promptitude and determination were admirable.

The Zionists have endeavoured to feel the pulse of these Principalities, and have tried to make a breach into which they can disseminate their poison and make a base for the direction of their organised movement* As soon as His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait knew this he ordered them to be deprived of their passports and banished so as to avoid an evil which might become dangerous and difficult of solution* These steps prove that this principality, which is a neighbour of Iraq, is well awake to and aware of the danger, and they will help in preventing these evil tentacles from spreading to other Arab Principalities such as Bahrain, Muscat etc* of Kuwaiti We should follow his lead in cleaning his country from the filth of Zionism. But how can we do this when some of our leaders are captives of the Zionists who shower on them wealth in divers ways. to important points. If the Government intends to uproot the seeds which have been sown, they must do what the Shaikh of Kuwait has done* Expecially since the evidence of their evil intentions is more apparent here than in Kuwait, but the difference between the two is great.

The locust party have been busy baiting the hoppers and saved Jahra village from invasion from a very large band estimated at 10-15 miles in length which was caught 2 miles from the village. The resulting slaughter has impressed the Kuwaitis so much that co-operation from bedou and hadhari has become excellent and the party’s services are continually in demand. Such crtiicism as wtrw remains is now concentrated on the slowness with which the bait reacts but the new supplies of gammexane that have arrived should help to dispel the feeling that there must be a more efficient and up to date method of slaughtering Xftsm hoppers.
