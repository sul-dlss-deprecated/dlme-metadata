Dear Brenan^, I enclose herewith two copies of the revised Saudi JCoweit Anti-Smuggling Regulations as they emerged after our meeting with de Gaury last Saturday. We agree that the next step might be to show the revised version tentatively to Sheikh Yusuf Yasm, making it clear that His Majesty's Government are in no way committed to it as it has not yet been communicated to the Sheikh of icoweit so that we do not yet knov/ whether he will accept ic though we think that there is a greater chance of his doing so in the modified form, if sheikh Yusuf Yasin raises no objection to the modifications the way will then be clear (subject to any observations which Powle may have to offer) for an approach to the Sheikh of Koweit. The method of approach to the latter will of course require careful consideration^ particularly in view of the Saudi insistence that there should bo also a Treaty of Extradition and a Treaty of Friendship and Bon voisinage^ but this can be left ior consideration until we know whether the revised version is acceptable to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. We presume that in the draft Article 1 'caravan 1 ' 7 includes motor car, as transport by motor car is contemplated in Article 3. Perhaps this should be mentioned to Yusuf Yasin. Yours sincerely (Sd.) A.C .B.Symon. •Brenan, Esq,, O.B.E. Foreign Office&gt; S o W . 1 QOPY SENT TO.i r 7 Article 1 . All goods which leave Kuwait territory for Saudi Arabia by land or sea must be accompanied by a person carrying a manifest. In the case of goods sent by land: (a) they must be sent by caravan ? and any person carrying goods from Kuwait territory who is not with a caravan shall be regarded as a smugglerj even if he has a manifest; (b) the caravan must call at that one of the points in Saudi Arabia mentioned in Article 7 below which is specified in the manifest; (c) the person carrying the manifest must also have with him a list showing the names of the persons in the caravan and the number of camels; (d) the person carrying the manifest shall report to the officials appointed for that purpose first at the Kuwait point and then at the Saudi Arabian point specified in the manifest. Persons entering Kuwait Territory from Saudi Arabia and cx i't taking out goods bought for their personal consumption, whether they are nomad or settled, must travel in parties and conform to the conditions laid down for commercial caravans. Goods which leave Kuwait Territory for Saudi Arabia by- sea must be taken to the Saudi Arab port specified in the manifesty and the person holding the manifest must report to the x)roper authorities at that port. The provisions about smuggling contained in the present regulations shall be applicable to goods transported by sea said to the persons transporting them. Article 2 . The person responsible for a caravan or party such as-is mentioned in Article 1 shall, before his departure with the caravan (or party) and the goods from Kuwait Territory for Saudi Arabia, obtain a manifest from the Kuwait Customs Department (Manifest Office) for all the goods destined for Saudi Arabia. This manifest must accompany the goods, and a copy of it shall be given to the Saudi Arab Trade/Trade Agent in Kuwait by the Kuwait Customs Office before the caravan (or party) leaves Kuwait Territory and a third copy of the manifest shall be kept in the Manifest Office. It is forbidden to take a quantity greater or less than that shown in the manifest or to go to any destination other than that mentioned in the manifest or by any route other than the ordinary one. Article 5 . Should the merchant or owner of the goods choose to send part of the goods by motor car and part by camel, or by two caravans, or part by sea and part by land, a separate manifest must accompany each part. Article 4» Any person who is found within the Territory of Kuwait in possession of goods intended for export to Saudi Arabia and without a manifest shall be punished by confiscation of the goods, and any (such) person who has a manifest but is in possession of goods in excess of those shown in the manifest shall be punished by confiscation of the excess not shown in the manifest. In both cases he shall be liable to a fine. Article 5 . Heads of caravans and holders of manifests must report to the nearest post any evasion or infraction of these regulations which cane to their knowledge, otherwise they themselves shall be held responsible if the evasion comes to ligh'G. Article p . The Customs officials of Kuwait and of Saudi Arabia at the specified posts may communicate with one another in order to ensure mutual understanding and the common good as regards the application of the rules of this regulation. Article 7 . The posts at which holders of manifests must report with their goods are as follows:- By// ^ ' / f o« By land either: (a) Kuwait Saudi Arabia or (b) Kuwait Sauai Araoici ••••»••••• -i.ib» G CiL 1 (c) Kuwait oaudi Araoiti •••••••«»* and they must go to these centres direct .and by the usual route. Article 8 . If any goods destined for Saudi Arabia are found to have left Kuwait Territory, whether by land or sea, without the foregoing Regulations having been complied with, such goods shall be considered contraband and, together with the means of transport, shall be liable to confiscation; moreover, any person whatsoever who infringes or who attempts to evade or circumvent these Regulations shall be liable to punishment by imprisonment, or fine, or both. Article 9 . These Regulations shall remain in force for a period of three years as from o « »mfY SENT TO P.Z. 3781/37. F 0K3IGK Oi 1 ? ICE, S . W . 1. 9th June, 1937. (E.3033/113/35). Important. Dear Symon Many thanks for your letter P.Z. 3438/37 of the 2nd June with which you were so good as to send rne copies of the revised baudi-Koweit anti-smuggling regulations as they emerged after our meeting with de Gaury on the 29th May. 2. We concur in this revised text but, after due consideration, Rendel feels that it would be useless to attempt to secure Sheikh Yusuf Yasin's concurrence in these changes here and now. 3. We are far from sure whether he would have authority to agree on his own responsibility to any alterations. Moreover, there may in any case be other changes to suggest as the result of de Gaury 1 s discussions with the Sheikh and we might merely be taking two bites at the same cherry by putting to him now the Siiiall textual alterations which we have made. 4. We would, therefore, suggest that (subject of course to Fowle's views) the next step should be for de Gaury to approach the Sheikh and show him the revised version of the proposed agreement explaining that, though it differs slightly in form - but not in substance - from the last version put forward by the Saudi-Arabian Government, we see no rea.son why they should raise any objections to it. 5. With regard to the other two agreements which the Saudi-Arabian Government wish to conclude concurrently with the anti-smuggling regulations, we are prepared to leave it to the authorities in the Gulf to decide on the method of approach/ C.B. Symon, Esq.approach to the Sheikh, but we understand in regard to all three agreements that the India Cffice are quite prepared for Captain de Gaury to take a fairly firm line with the Sheikh in inducing him to accept such Saudi proposals as His Majesty's Government think reasonable. 6. Would you let me know if you agree generally so that we can let Bullard know what has been and is being done? Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) T.Y.

The revised draft regulations proposed by Saudi Arabian Government have been examined in collaboration with Political Agent, Kuwait# nis Majesty^ Governments provisional view is that Saudi draft goes a long way towards meeting Shaikh of Kuwaiti point of view and may well prove acceptable to him particularly if pre- - sen ted in the form suggested in draft v/hich forms an enclosure to J-ndia Office letter to Jtoreign Office Xto .P.Z,3458/37, dated 2nd J une 1937. it will be understood that no attempt has been made to make regulations word perfect. Subject thcre^ -fore to any observations which you and Political Resident may have to offer it is suggested that we should now take action the following lines. J xhe Political Agent, Kuwait, should be instructed to takeE. take an early opportunity of showing revised version to ahaikh explaining that though it differed; Slightly iii form - but not ixi substarxie — ♦ from version put forv/ard by Saudi Arabian Govern- -ment Mis Majesty^ Government see no reason to anticipate that they will raise any objection to it. Ifj as is hoped, Shaikh is willing to accept revised version next step will be to ascertain his reactions to proposal of Saudi-Arabian Government that in add- -1tlon to irade Agreement there should also be agree- -mente relating to extradition and jbon voisina^e . ihe Saudi Arabian Government have made it perfectly ^Ictin that they regard it as indispensable that the three agreements should come into force simultaneously and his Majesty^ UovernmeQt see no means of ending present system of blockade unless this is accepted. Prima facie their attitude is not unreasonable and in view of importance of securing an early resumption of normal relations between miwait ard Saudi Arabia his Majesty's Government consider that every effort should be made to induce the Shaikh to accept Saudi Government's proposal. -i-t i s under stood .1 that ^audi Arabian gov- -ernment contemplate in addition that agreements should be on the lines of those in force betv/een ^audi Arabia and Iraq see enclosures to Baghdad -c^eQidency despatch r —' to Colonial Office of May 6th 1931, copy forwarded to Government of mdia with india office weekly letter jcfz, $o#23 of June 4th 1931 ^copy was sent direct to -^oli- -tical Resident and a copy is now being sent by air mail to Political Agent, -Kuwait. • n is ■ i ^ajest3''s Gover- -ment see no reason to object to adoption of extradition agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq as a basis for di scussions &gt; T ' - . ^ 3 • ■ -r discussion of a similar agreement betv ^een ^audi Arabian and Kuwait. the other hand treaty y of Bon Voisina ^e between ciaudi Arabia and luiwait appears to contain much that would be objectionable to His Majesty s Government from point of view of its inclusion in an agreement between iiaudi Arabia and Jiuwai^. J-n particular i would invite atten- -tion to Article 11 which deals with diplomatic and consular relations. while therefore it is possible that Shaikh of Kuwait is already aware of teims of treaties in force between his two powerful neighbours his Majesty s Government do not consider that he should be shown treaties in question or be given any hint that Saudi Arabian Government have put forward suggestion be that these treaties should/adopted as a basis for dis- -cussion. iror the present purposes it will perhaps be sufficient if object of treaties are explained to Shaikh in general teims and if h^ agreesin principle- (he actual terms thereof can be taken up with baudi Arabian Government• If you and Political Kesident agree with this view Political Agent Kuwait might be instructed to approach Shaikh accordingly. c , U I 4.

It is of course impossible to predict what reactions of Shaikh are likely to be to this suggestion but Mis Majesty»s uovernnent are inclined to think that he should now be told that the contemplated agreements will be embodied in an Anglo «SaUdi exchange of notes.

If we * give him the Regulations ana the suggestion for the other two at the same time ana he rejects the first on some excuse, we shall never be quite certain whether it was not aue to fear of the other two. Also taken as a whole too it would be rather much with which to face the Shaikh all at once. If however he has accepted The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.S.,C.B,E. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIR5.acceptea the Regulations, which were all that was until recently contemplateci, we shall be in a slightly stronger position to put forward, as a concession to Saudi Arabia, a moairied edition of tne Iraq-Saudi Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements, A close copy of these agreements, particularly the Bon Yoisinage would be unacceptable to us: take for example the paragrapn about exchange or diploraatic representatives# I do not myself see any reason why the ShaiKh should object on principle to a modified edition - possibly one agreement combining both the Bon Yoisinage and ISxtradlition elements, being signed by us on his behalf. To give the Shaikh an idea of what he would be asked to accept, the best thing would perhaps be to show him a copy of the Saudi-Iraq agreements with the paragraphs impracticable from our point of view deleted. Incidentally no copies of either agreement are in this Office. So I cannot comment in detail or draft a modified edition, wnich might be acceptable to both sides and His Majesty's Government. w- 3 - sT 5. I notice that the Saudi Arabs speak of agreement between the Saudi Arab Government and the Kuwait Government (para 7 of Yusif Yassin's letter to Mr.Calvert of 17th August, received under Jedda No, 1545/507/61 of 25th August 1^6), but I presume \j t T)J7that they are not going to challenge our position in the matter of Kuwait's foreign relations or signature on behalf of Kuwait.&amp;3/54 if Telegram 3. j'roiti political Resicientj B^siiire# rp (j-ovsrnment of Indisij Sx'terncLl Aiia.irs ^Jepartudent, oimla.

In the case of the Trade Agreement he has a proviso to make, because he i s somewhat doubtfu^. as to the definition of caravan, (see India Office letter No. P.2.3438/37 of the 2nd June, 1927 in which Mr.Symon expresses doubt also). His Highness in discussing this with me said that all traders would be despatched together, in caravan. It might, however, and almost certainly would, occur, that when there has been no large caravan to Central Arabia for some little time with certain commodities, and the demand and price was increasingincreasing in consequence, small traders would want to take the opportunity to hurry off with what was available^ They might muster only a few camels or say two cars. Would this be a caravan? 5* He believed that with goodwill and in practice, once the scheme was v/orking there would be no difficulty, but he also felt bound to mention this, and make the proviso given in his letter, para 1, so that Junior officials might not, in their zeal, fasten on to what was probably an unavoidable indefiniteness and turn back a small caravan. 6.

Article 9 is the same as Article 10 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty down to 'respective governments for decision'. Thereafter the exception noted in the Iraq Saudi clause under the Bahra Agreement is naturally left out. Ilo comments. (Article 11 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty is not applicable to Kuwait.) Article 10 is the same as Article IS of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. Ho comments. Article 11. Down to 'without obtaining previous permission' this article is the same as Article 13 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. A further reference to the Bahra Agreement in Article 13 is naturally left out of article 11 whi ch/ (Copy sent ugder P # L»No.G-357 d, 2.11» , 37 to P # A,Kuwait.)! 2. which goes on 'subject to the provisions » down to 'by its permission'. In Article 11 1 think thst after •previous peraission' might be added 'from the Authorities referred to in Article 7 W . The sentence in Article 11 'subject to the provisions..by its permission' might be left out. o far as I know there are no other agreement s concluded between Kuwait r.rxd Saudi Arabia. (Article 14 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty is not applicable to Kuwait.) Article 12 is the same as Article 15 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty down to 'concluded between them'.Thereafter Ee&amp;.G. are made the arbitrators. The provisions of Article 16 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty are not provided for by Captain de Gaury. Some such final article would have to be ?&gt;dded to the Kuwait Saudi Treaty and would, I suppose, record the fnct that the treaty was being made by H.M.Q. on behalf of Kuwait. 2. In addition to the above remarks my general feeling about Captain de Gaury's draft is that we do not come at Fill into the picture. (1) Article 4. As you are aware we attach considerable importance to preventing the ^eikh from having direct correspondence with Ibn Saud but Article 4 gives the right to both parties to notify (i.e. correspond with) each other on certain matters. It is true that these matters are limited to highway robbery, raiding, etc., but correspondence has a way of extending beyond its original limits and I think we should soon find the Sheikh and Ibn Saud corresponding freely on all sorts of political questions. In fact my own opinion is that one of the objects of the Saudi Government in tagging on this treaty and that on Extradition to the Trade Agreement (the other object was to delay the Istter coming into force) was to increase Saudi influence in Kuwait by getting into direct touch with the Sheikh. There would aeem to be/6 3 3. be two rays in which we can come into the picture in regard to this article :• (a) by inserting in the clause a proviso that correspondence between the Sheikh mnd the Saudi Government should pass through the Political Agent in Kuwait; or (b) by arranging with the .Sheikh that all such correspondence should be shown to the Political Agent. (2). Article 5, 'Musabila' is one of the obstacles,from the Saudi point of view,10 the Trade Agreement. However, there is no objection to mention of Musabila for the present in the draft. Article 7. I think we ought to associate the Political Agent somehow or other with the 'competent authorities*. As a precedent for this you will remember that the lolitical Agent, Kuwait, was recently associated with an official of the Iraq Government in the investigation of certain Kuwait Iraq frontier incidents. In order to secure this association a proviso to that effect would have to be inserted in this clause. (4). Article 8. Similarly we ought to associate the Political Agent with the Frontier Commission especially in view of the wide scope of this Commission as laid down in Article 9. 3. In insisting with the Sheikh and the Saudi Government that we should be as -ociated in some form or other with the activities on which the success of the Treaty would largely depend we are, I think, on strong ground. In the first pl^ce the Treaty will be made on behalf of the Sheikh of Kuwait by H.M.G. who are responsible for the foreign relations of Kuwait. In the second place in case of serious differences over the implementing of the Treaty/4. Treaty ariaing between the Sheikh and the Saudi Government the latter will undoubtedly apply to us for sssietance, and we would be in a much better position to smooth matters over if we had been kept informed by the Political A^ent of the rights and wrongs of the matter in dispute from the beginning. Further, the Political Agent by being associated with the Frontier authorities will oft m be able to influence both sides to settle questions amicably on the spot. 4. We might discuss the whole treaty question some time,1 i in iwwwwwiwB—im iiniiiiiii ri—HB I am keeping a copy of thla for Buahlre file. - C - r Mr.Symon . In continuation of my previous note of the 11th October on the subject of the Kuwait Saudi Treaty of Friendship herewith ray comments on Captain de Gaury^ dmft of the Kuwait Saudi Extradition Treaty. Articles 1 to 3 are mut a tis mutandis the same as the corresponding articles of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. Article 3 seems to corer offences, i.e. brignndage, theft, etc., which are so far as I know not generally considered as 'political' offences (see first sentence of this article). I think the offences covered by this article might be restricted (see my comments in para. 2 below). Article 4. The demand for extradition by either Government has to be made through H.M.G.'s representatives. This is quite correct nnd short circuits direct correspondence between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh. (Since both Governments in so far as demands for extradition are concerned are covered by Article 4 there is no need for an article in the Kuwait Saudi Treaty corresponding to Article 5 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty.) Articles 5 and 6 are the same as Articles 6 and 7 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. Article 8 of the Iraq Saudi Treaty. There is no corresponding article in Captain de Gaury's draft. This article contains the important proviso that the treaty shall remain in force for a period of three years,after which it can be abrogated by either side. In the Iraq Saudi Treaty of Friendship no time limit is laid down. 2, I must confess I do not feel very happy over there being an Extradition Treaty at all between Kuwait (i and/ (Sent under P.L.Uo.G-357 d, 2.11.'Z7 to P .A .Kuwait.)and 3audi Arabia. As you are aware political refugees from the Saudi Gorernment take refuge in Kuwait not necessarily in the town but anongst the Bedouin in Kuwait territory. In order to ^et the-e individuals extradited the Saudi Government will probably trump up offences of brigandage etc. against the refugees. The Sheikh may refuse to deliver up the persons concerned and we shall inevitably be drfiwn into the squabble. I think.therefore, in order to minimise this risk that the definition of political offences in Article 3 (see my comments above) might be considerably narrowed.■■■■■Hi Nn. 1623/307/58. 67 HIS Majesty's Charge d 1 Affaires a t Jedda presents his compliments to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the and him the under-mentioned doonmente.

It will be necessary to have the Shexkh ? s approval in writing before the draft is shorn to the Saudi Governirient. I do not think that he will raise objections to fUM.G-. concluding the agreement on his behalf and it will then be necessary, as suggested by you, to et the ThelMi to authorise H.:'. z. to conclude it on his behalf* As I unlerstand it, H*:uCr. do not make themselves responsible that the terns of the agreement will be kept by Koweit* I entirely concur in this though naturally our good offices will be available for adjusting difficulties in an amicable manner. 3. ith regard to article 3, the appointment of 'i „ Special Officials and para. S of llr. Synon's note, I concur that it would be difficult to associate the Political Agent, Koweit, with the day to day work of these officials and likewise that it would be equally difficult to withhold the right of these officials to correspond with each other. This correspondence would normally/u&gt; 1 2 normally by on imiraportant local matters# 4. In regard to article 15, the Permanent Frontier Ccraiission. My original objcction^'to the poaslbility of direct correspondence between the Sheikh of Koireit and the Saudi Government are met hy the phrase in s.(3) 'shall endeavour to settle the nxotter by discussions through the British Le-Ration at Je :da'. I rega d it as important th t the Political Agent should 'be one of the Koweiti members or at any rate associated v/ith the Oormlssion in some -.'ay. I daresay that as stxr^ested by the :-\Q. It may be niore suitable to arran e for this association rs a domestic question with the he-Xld'u 5. I note thnt throughout the draft coninu icstions between the two Governments of Saudi Arabia and Kov/eit pass f, throu^ the British Legation at Jedda n » I presume there is no need to specifically mention the Political Resident, since the normal channel of corrramica11 on between the She ' ):h of Koweit and the Saudi Goverrxient is via the Resident and the British Legation. 6« Article 9 # As Mr. Synon points o^xt in his note this article is more restrictive than the original one, but I do not think that re need, or indeed can, object. All/All Governments have the right to restrict the movements of individuals across their frontiers* 7. Article 12 which refers to article 9* unless I have nisunderstood it, seems redundant, since article 9 already gives the respective Governments the ri 'ht of restriction. 8. Article 10, it seems to me, could consist merely of one section beginnin with the present b*2 T? It shall not be lawful' down to 'of this agreement' (fifth line). ^ it is not lawful for either Cover ment to per :lt nationals of the other Government to be employed in its armed forces surely it follows that neither Government can co:i?oel such nationals to enlist. tTlie rest of s»2 v;ould appe r to be unnecessary and likewise s.5. 9.

As the text stands in our revised draft it will a parently suffice for either of the two Governments concerned to send in an authentic requisition for the surrender of a fugitive offender without supporting the requisition with any legal evidence that the crime, for which extradition is sought, has in fact been committed. There is so far as we are aware, no objection to this per se since we understand it is a fact that a number of countries, unhampered by legal requirements such as Habeas Corpus , are prepared to surrender fugitives from justice on the strength of a mere requisition. It may not be practicable or desirable from the point of vie?/ of local conditions to tighten up this provision but the omission seems to invite^precisely that kind of spurious requisition which ? /v j-N X &lt;? Fowle anticipates on page 4 of his note, a copy of which was attached to your letter to me of e2nd January. If it is nevertheless t ought desirable to tighten up the article in this respect we suggest it might be sufficient to add to sub / paragraph (b) the words 'together with the original depositions or affirmations of all witnesses, or authentic co ios thereof 1 * or/ Gibson Ssq., / .ndia Office. H ^or something of a similar nature appropriate to local conditions. 3. You will also see that we have proposed an article to cover the Neutral Zone, with two alternative forms of which we prefer the second, although without a knowledge of local circumstances it is difficult to know what arrange.lents are possible or necessary.

In paragraph Z of his note I see that Fo^ie envisages the necessity of obtaining the Sheikh 1 s written authority for his Majesty's Government to concxuae agreements with the Saudi Arabian Government on his behalf, vVe have come to the conclusion that, from the international point of view, there is no need to obtain any written authority from the Sheikh, because His Majesty's Government control his foreign aflairs and are internationally responsible for his actions including his performance of this proposed agreement• But/ ■ ^ ^ibaoji, £,34 india Office.

E. The drafts forwarded by Mr, Caroe have been considered in detail in consultation with the Foreign Office and witn Sir Trenchard .Fowle during the latterperiod of deputation in London and I am now to forward, for the consideration of the Government of India, a copy of the drafts in the form in which, subject to their views and to any further vievvs v/nich the Political Resident may wish to express, His Majesty's Government consider that they should oe submitted lor the concurrence of the Sheikh of ivoweit or -tor any oDoer\^tiono which he may have to make on their detailed piovisiono. 3. Of these drafts the draft 'bon voiainage 1 ftgreement , excluding the schedule, is, with one inconsiderable. exception, in the £ orm in which Sir Trenc h a rd Fow ls concurred while in London in April. The 'general rules' forming the schedule to the draft were prepared subsequently b;&gt; uiie Foreign Office on the basis of the schedule attv _.cl.ied co th 'bon voisinage' Agreement oi 193^ between Saudi Arabia a Transjordan. They have not yet been seen b3 7 the ioli cretary to the Government of India, Resident,/ Ext e rnal Affairs Depar t me nt, Simla.a - 2 - Resident, and if the local Political Authorities consider that any important modiiications are required I am to ask that the matter may be referred to the Secretary of State 4, 2he araft extradition agreement in its present form has also not yet been seen by the Political Resident, and I am to enclose for consideration a copy of the demi-official il 738) letter v/ith which it was received from the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State is content to leave it to the Government o.l Inaia to decide j in consultation with the Political resident, whether it is desirable to amend Article y&lt;i\. T' 4 m the direction indicated by the Foreign Office, and which of the alternative forms of Article 7 should be adopted, I am to ask, however, that (as in the case of the Schedule ' the 'bon voisinage' agreement) reference may be made to him if in other respects any substantial modification of the draft is thought necessary. 5. It will be observed that the drafts of both agreements have been cast in the form of an agreement made by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, 'acting in their own name and on behalf of His Highness the Sheikh of K owe it'. Explicit expression is thus given to the acceptance by His Majesty 1 s Government of responsibility for the fulfilment of the obligations described in the agreements. This responsibility derives from the control exercised by His Majesty's Government over the foreign affairs of Koweit by virtue of which - and in evidence of which - the present agreements are being mediated by them with the Saudi Arabian Government, I am to enquire whether in the circumstances the Government of India and the Political Resident see any objection to the proposal that His Majesty's Government, by concluding agreements with the Saudi Arabian Government in this form, should explicitly undertake responsibility for the/the fulfilment by the Sheikh of the obligations which he would assume. It would of course be most desirable that in Oidei to ensure the discharge of H.iVi.G.»s responsibility for the observance of the agreements by the Sheikh/'his formal approval 01 the drait texts should be obtained before signature together with his undertaking to observe their provisions. It is also advisable that H .M .G. should have his request (as distinct from his authorisation) to negotiate, and subsequently to conclude, the agreements on his behalf. 0 • ciccoidingly to request that, when the terms of the enclosed drafts have been settled as indicated in paras, o and 4 above, the Government of India may instruct the Political Resident to communicate the drafts to the Sheikh of Kovveit, to consult him on the substance of their provisions ■ .:i and to seek his concurrence in H.M .G. 1 s proposal to negotiate with the Saudi Arabian Government on these lines. Subsequently, and before the agreements were concluded, it would be necessary, if the Government of India and the Political Resident agree to the procedure proposed in this letter, to obtain from the Sheikh a formal communication, in the form of an exchange of notes with the Sheikh which would be drafted in consultation with the Foreign Office, conveying his approval of the terms, his request to H .iVi .G. to conclude the agreements, and his promise to carry out their provisions It is considered desirable that at the same time he should be asked to undertake to nominate the Political Agent, Koweit, as one of the Koweit members of the Permanent Frontier Commission referred to in Article 13 of the ' T bon voisinage' agreement. jT 7.

D. Q^o, a/311. Dated the 20th October, 19 33, tie Could you please refer to correspondence ending with India Office 'Sxpress Letter Ho#P,Z.6585/38, dated the 27th September 1938, on the subject of the Kuwait - Saudi Arabian Treaties. 2# I thought it best in the first instance to give the Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements unofficially to the Shaikh in order to test his reactions. He consulted the Council unofficially. In this connection it must be remenabered that while the question of these treaties is one of external affairs, and therefore outside the scope of the Council, we cannot of course prevent the Shaikh consult ing his Council concerning such questions. This in fact would be the normal procedure of Rulers in the other Arab States of the Persian Gulf, where Councils already exist, though hitherto not of the official complexion which prevails at Kuw&amp;it. 3. A couple of days later the Shaikh informed me unofficially that both he ao d the Council were in favour of all the clauses of both treaties except the preamble in each, which the Council wished to alter as follows. Bon Voisinage / R.T.Peel Esquire, M.C., The India Office, London. \Bon Voisinage» The Government of Kuwait and the Government of Saudi Arabia being desirous of promoting and maintaining friendly relations and good neighbourliness between the Government of Kuwait and the Government of Saudi Arabia have agreed as follows i- and they have for this purpose appointed authorised representatives on their behalf, for His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait, H#E#f His Britannic Majesty's jlinister at Jedda, bearing the title of por His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia tetrad it ion # The Government of Kuwait and the Government of Saudi Arabia as they are desirous for completing an agreement about the extradition of offenders and fugutives etc. etc• The Shaikh did not express his own opinion as to this suggestion of the Oouncil, and at this stage I did not think it advisable to ask him for it, or to express wy opinion as to the Council's emendation, I contented myself therefore with saying tbat it was satisfactory (which of course it is) that both he aa d the Council were in favour of the terms of the trealjieis. *&gt;• With regard to the Council^ proposed amendment neither/-3- ( - ; *»■ neither de Gaury nor I think timt nq should accept it as it obviously and publicly (the treaties when made will be published) ignores the control of His Mage3ty f s Government over the foreign relations of Kuwait# If His Majesty^ Government concur I suggest that de Gaury should take up the matter again unofficially with the Shaikh and get the latter to endeavour to persuade the Council to withdraw their amendment, de Gaury could point out that this amendment ignores the special position of His Majesty's Government under which the latter control the foreign relations of KUwait, de Gaury could add that the Saudi Government themselves had recognised this position by conducting the negotiations for the Trade Agent with His Majesty's Govern ment and by asking the latter to arrange for the Bon Voisinage and i&lt;pctradition treaties. It is quite possible that the Shaikh may be able to persuade the Council without difficulty since de Gaury is of opinion that the Council's move is probably a •♦try on rt . If the Shaikh succeeds in this then the way is clear for sending him an official letter as indicated below, I do not think that in this raatter we should have any direct relations with the Council though this would not preclude a friendly talk over a cup of coffee between de Gaury and Abdulla al Balim, the President of the Council, If the Shaikh cannot persuade the Council, or professes to be unable to do so, then de Gaury should send him the drafts of the treaties under a brief official forwarding letter, making no mention of course of the unoff ic ial /53/54 Telegram Q, ^ rorQ Seoretary of State for India, London.

If no report has yet been received as to the attitude of the Sheikh towards these agreements* would it be possible for a telegraphic enquiry bo be addressed to the Political Resident? If only because of the increasingly serious situation with regard to smuggling from Koweit into Iraq (see our letter B 5 1 705/ i 75/9l of 19th October)-, it is clearly necessary that every effort should be maae to pusn on towards the consumma'cion of our efforts to laise the Saudi blockade Yours ever?

INDIA OFPICE 5 ^HITErlALLj, S. .1, 171h November ? 193 8 Dear Baggallay^ Please refer to your letter of the 4th. November (E. 6199/46 o/ v /l). You will have seen that on the 51 October (India Office letter No.P.Z.7320/38) sent you a copy of Powle's letter of the 20th October repoi ting the reception given 'by the Sheikh of Koweit and his Council 'co the draft Bon Voisinage on Extradition treaties vi'i tn Saucii Arabia which were coinmunicated to them unofficially. i s good news that the body of both draft accepted 3 and that exception was taken by the Council (not altogether unexpectedly) only to the preambles, which you know had been deliberated, drafted so as to emphasise tae responsibility of His Majesty's G-overnment for the external relations of Koweit. The Council's redraft reveals an unwillingness to acknowledge this position. It may not be a bad thing that the issue has arisen at this early stage of the Council's existence,, since if we can secure the acceptance of the formula of our drafts we Baggallay, Esq., shall/ Foreign Office, S. W. 1.2. shall have gone a long way to clarify His Majesty's Government's position in the eyes of the Council. At the same time it is important that officially we should deal only with the Sheikh 3 particularly so in order to disabuse the Council of their pretensions (as indicated in Article 3 of the 'Inaugural Law w ) to authority in the siohere of Koweit ! s external relations.^/ ^ ' V (Please see in this connexion paragraph 2 of the letter No. P. Z. 6062/38 which we sent to Fowle on the 30th September afto;r consulting you. I enclose a copy as it is not clear that a copy of the letter as issued was sent to you). 3. We do not much like some of the implications of Powle's proposal that de Gaury should get the Sheikh '' to endeavour to pe rsuade the Counci l to .wi^tji^aw—tp.eir amendment . We want 0 if poseiDiej to avoid, any impression that we recognise the Council as having any status giving them a deciding voice in a question of external affairsj though it was quite natural ana pxoper for the Sheikh to consult them on the substance of ^he draft treaties. We have therefore considered whether it would 'be 'better to proceed straight away to one sta^e ox sending the Sheikh an official communication on bhe ^ b • I lines indicated in paragraph 6 of Powle's letter, a step that/that rnus fc be taken sooner or later 3 and ask de G-aury to explain to him that the Council's amendment is unaccepbable uo rlis Majesty's Government 'because of its failure to recognise tneir special position under v^hich they control the foreign relations of Koweit, and to leave it to the Sheikh to deal with the Council as he thinks best. There is 3 of course 9 the risk, whatever course is folloved ? uiiat the Council may adhere to their views and that insistence on our formula may lead to an open conflict of opinion between the Council and the Sheikh in which we should naturally support the latter, but we must be prepared to face this situation, 4. The 'best course, however, especially in view of the urgency of getting the negotiation through, seem to be to leave it to Powle's discretion to get the Sheikh f s agreement in whatever way he considers to be most expeditious and least likely to lead to trouble in Koweit, provided always that de Gaury in his approach to the Sheikh should not give the impression of attributing any executive authority to the Council in the matter. 5. We propose therefore, if you concur, to instruct Fowle /4, yA F ovi I g in the sense of the foregoing paragraph 5 and v ;e shoulcl 'be glad to have your views as early as possible. Yours sincerely.

D.O.No.C- C ?vy I should I think inform you that duringNfffS following the recent crisis the Sheikh has 'been, so far as we are concerned, in extremely good mood, and it is now, I think, a propitious moment to tackle him about the Agreements with Saudj Arabia, 2, Apart from this it is, I consider, for other reasons, becoming increasingly urgent to press for a settlement without delay. The date trade season has this year been an extremely poor one. Owing to this, and the low ebb of the pearl market many Kuwaitis are rapidly getting in a bad way financially, and part of the political restlessness here is undoubtedly due to the contrast between ^neir own position and that of the Basrawis, who prosper/various other trades and contracts. These trades are attracting some Kuwaitis, while others have taken loans from Iraqis, It will not oe long before they think their interests lie more in tnat direction, Iraq, than in that of i^ejd. It may be this that the King, informed by Fuad Hamza, has foreseen and why he has so suddenly changed his views and pressed for a quick settlement.

Do the General Rules'* (p.98) to the draft ♦♦'bon voisinage' Agreement require any important modifications? P.A.Kuwait has 'hot suggested any. 2. is it desirable to amend Article 4 of the Extraditi Agreement as suggested in para.2 (p.81) of the P.O.letter Oi 27th April ? P.A.Kuwait is against the amendment. 3. ,Vhich of the two alternative forms of Article 7 (ii) (p.85) of the 'Extradition Agreement should be adopted ? Like the P.O. ,P # A. prefers the second alternative. 4. Is any objection seen to the proposal that H.M.G., by concluding the Agreements in the form suggested, should t explicitly undertake responsibility f&lt;Dr the fulfilment by the /iMvnnnMiiMRi&amp;H m- (i^ —• Plv 53/54 the Shaikh of the obligations he would as® me ? P.A# has not commented. In para.2 (p.75) of hia Note of 2l3t April Sir Trenchard ^owle expressed the view that H.M.G. should not assume such responsibility. The I.O. view is that such responsibility derives from the control exercised by it over the foreign affairs of Kuwait, It is unlikely that the Saudi Govt, would conclude the Agreements unless H.M .G. asaimed this responsibility. 5. Is procedure proposed in the.I.O. letter, the obtaining from the Sheikh of his formal approval of the draft texts, his undertaking to observe their provisions, and his request for the negotiation and conclusion by H.M.fr. of the Agreements on his behalf, agreed to ? haa not commented. Whether H.M.G. assumes responsibility vis a vis the Saudi Govt, or not fcr the fulfilment by the Shaikh of the Agreements, the procedure suggested by ' ■ y C/ f * : the 1.0. is necessary in order that the Shaikh may not subsequently repudiate his responsibility to H.M.G. for the fulfilment of his obligations.
