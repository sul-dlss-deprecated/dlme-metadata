These cheeseparing methods,irksome as they are in their application, are imposed hy the precarious margin 'between State Revenues and Expenditure. V I have already drawn attention in my Financial Report for 6 months ending 30th June 1926 to the inelasticity of the largest capital heads of expenditure E.G.Civil List and Military.The scale on which they were framed in 1920 - and3 / /' and within limits olDserved ever since-has come to he © considered as fixed and irreducible.That scale as I have sho\m elsewhere had relation (i) to an artificial prosperity following the raising of a loan (ii) to a dollar exchange of Rs # 200» Now while the internal trade of the country has continued to he carried on chiefly in dollar currency,80 % of State expenditure has to he met on a rupee 'basis • In a collects normal year the Treasury/44000 dollars which have to he converted into rupees to meet State obligations (in rupees). In this connection-and quite apart from the reduced purchasing power of the country which it implies-the following tahle showing the downward path of the dollar since 1920 is self explanatory. The ©ollar Exchange i.e.rupee equivalents of 100 dollars. Year .

When it is remembered that the State this year is carrying the additional 'burden of a patrol ship,the position to date^ gives,I venture to think,cause for satisfaction. The State has not once defaulted in payment of the instalment of Government of India loan at the rate of Rs.93480-10 per annum, and has now liquidated Es.654^6^/15 i.e. a sum in excess of the original loan of Es.650000. But the 'burdens enumerated ahove have precluded,and continue to preclude any ameliorative refors whatsoever. The State continuesto pay its way,'but in doing so is obliged to neglect the most rudimentary claims of one Government School for the country,a Doctor for Gwadur,Electric Light tor Muscat,or the repair ot District forts which are fast decaying: and these and any other ameliorative measures,under present circumstances^must await the final liquidation of the State deht in December 1929. This stalemate could in part he relieved 'by a slight revision of the time period of the loan repayments,and to this end I am submitting separate proposals for your consideration. Vi With regard to the summarised position for the year given 'T ivn &lt; n at the foot of the Revenue Statement I would v you that the State system of 'bringing routine expenditure to account one month in arrear makes the 'book 'balances,as shown,illusory. It is necessary in each case to deduct from the 'balance shown a round sum of Rs.55000(i.e.,normal monthly routine expenditure) in order to arrive at the true financial position. The resultant actual 'balance at the 'beginning of the year is then shown to 'be Rs.55000 : this sum will also represent approximately the anticipated 'balance at the end of the year. This surplus while in itself satisfactory,is not such as to allow a single haiza 'being expended on ameliorative measures. Reference to my graph will show that it is adequate only to ensure escape from a financial crisis at the 'bottom of the curve in the lean months of April and June. I have the honour to 'be Sir. A.M.

Tlie Hon* ole the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 66 i Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of the revised 'budget estimates of T'uscat State for the year 1931. 2* The budget is made up of (a) the actual Receipts and Expenditures for t^.e first 6 months of 1951 (January to June) and (b) the estimated Receipts and Expenditures for the second half of the year (July to December). 3. On the 1st of July a general retrenchment of all State expenditure took place, and, in s^ite of the fact that at the end of the year these retrenchments will only have operated for a period of six months still the total expenditure over the whole of the year 1931, including payment of the instalment of the Government of India loan and an allotment of Rs.4,000 on account of an increase in the Privy purse ^ on the Sultan's return in November, will not exceed the total revenue for that year# 4. .Vhile the Receipts side of the Budget gives every indica^ tion of reaching the estimated figure of Rs.7,74,400, the Expenditure side, will, if nothing untoward occurs, fall some- v/hat short of this figure. Tbe reason for this is (a) that greater expenditure has 'been allowed for under some of the major heads such as defenceand civil adniinistratxon than is actually bein^ incurred and (b) that further economies have taken place and are still taking place since the drawing of the budget. This surplus of revenue over expenditure will be demoted to paying off some of the outstanding debts due to merchants« 5# It is however to be noted that for this year f 1931,it is enough to be able to pay the usual instalment of the Government of India loan, and regular arrangements for repaying debts due from the State to private individuals can commence next year, when, on a whole yea^s working, the retrenchments will pro duce a definite surplus revenue over expenditure. 6* As regards His Highness tne Sultan, according to informa tion, he will return to Muscat- in Kovember, and, for the last two months of the year his Privy Purse has been fixed by the President of the Council at Rs.7,000 per mensem. If, as is hoped, he remains on in the State permanently, his ^urse, until such time as all debts to private merchants are paid off, will have to remain at this figure in order not to decrease the surplus revenue earmarked for the repayment of the said debts. It is quite possible, however, that the President of the Council will succeed in effecting such further economies by the new year as y /ill enable the Sultan to receive his full allowance. This is, of course, a very desirable thing as His Highness is bound to entertain in a style befitting his position as Sultan of Muscat. 7. as regards the cut of 5^' in the civil list on those drawing Hs.100 and more, this may be discounted a^. of no 'falue, it is only a gesture and does not affect the ultimate budget by more than a thousand rupees. At the special desire of His Highness the Sultan the allowance of Saiyid ITadir, Saiyid Thajab ( a remittance man in Paris, forbidden ever to return to I'uscat) and a number of others on the list are untouched, while an a^ed relative has been added to it at Hs.95/- per mensem. The civil list is a question to be left alone now its3 member s t if vressed too far could make things exceedingly unpleasant both for His Highness and his son* In any case xXaJt the State has done all that was ever required of it, the budget has been balanced, debts will be repaid and the finances with a little attention will continue to pay their way. 8. a few remarks on the figures of the Budget may be of interest. On the Receipts side the Customs revenue has been estimated at Rs.4,93,000, this was Kr. Hedgcoc^s figure, based, I imagine, on last yea^s actuals decreased proportionately to the drop in prices of commodities* How accurate this estimate v/as can be seen by taking the actual realisations for the last 6 months which amount to lis.2,34,474-11-0, adding a like amount for the next 6 months plus Zakat which has still to be realised and will approximate to Rs.40,000 to 50,000. The total will be somewhere around Rs.5,00,000. Last year, 1930, Customs actual Receipts for the first 6 months were Rs.2,52,420 and in the 2nd 6 months Rs.3,11,895 thus showing an increase of about Rs.80,000 in collections during the 2nd half of the year, thesebeing mostly Zakat collections. ZAKaT . Last year collections, excluding Shimaliyah, amounted to about Ks.16,000, the present figure, a fc ain that of Hr.Hedgcock allows for a decrease of about 50^ in the price of dates,» General opinion has it that this amouAt will be realised. As regards Shimaliyah it might be noticed that the figure of i ?s. 15,284 shown as collected to date, represents arrears due from the farmers from last year, the Rs.43,000 for which the district has been farmed is still to be realised. 9. ihile on the subject of Customs Receipts I may mention that Saiyid Said, the President of the Council has just made• a most successful visit to Sur, the new Customs house is now being built, dhows are being registered, and all the practices for ikx evasion of Customs dues such as false manifests are being stopped. While this will result in an increaoe of 20,00030,000 doilcrs to 3'ir Cusuoms, this will mostly be s^ent in improving the security of the ^laoe, ^eventing ogling etc. 3ur lias always been avoided by everyone as being too difficult to deal with and it reflects the greatest credit on the young Heir that he should have laid the foundations of a lasting settle ment there. Previously, the method of dealing with the place has =een to assemble an armada every few years, bear down upon Sur and bombarded it into submission and payment of tribute. The present visit was quite unaccompanied except by a few retainers and all requests were agreed to voluntarily by the people themselvesa 13. (a) on the Expenditure side, it has already been noted that His Highness the oultan's Purse is fixed at Rs.7,000 per mensem for ITovember and December iae, on his return (b) In 19S0 the Ruling Family were j.aid Rs. 1,87,872, in 19Si it will r aid ..oa 1,70,406, i.e. RSal7 &gt; 466 less than last year. (c) In 1^30 the Levy Corps cost Rs.1,^1,200, in 1931 it will,* cost Hs e&gt; y4 &gt; 650 i.e. a decrease of Rs.66, 550 andin 1932 it is estimated t._ t it /ill cost Rs.72,000, this without any decrease in the number of Rifles. (d) The launch in 1930 cost Rs.39,000,in 1931 it will cost Rs. 20,000. (e) General Administration in 1930 cost Rs.1,88,500, in 1931 it will cost Rs.1,50,000. (f) Customs, in 1930 it cost Rs.88,000, in 1931 it will co^t its. 75,000. i (o) bxiimalyah expenditure has come down from Rs. 43,000 in i9o0 to R3 .33,900 in 1931 (actually it will be(less owin£ to change of i^ali and other changes).

BEVEMto* It may be noted that Shumaliyah revenue for August is not yet to hand, but Rs.200Q/-(approximately) is expected which will bring total Shumaliyah collections upto Rs.20,000/- to date, thus total actuals for 8 months will reach Rs.4,63,813 or about a lac behind the proportionate figure. always show heavier receipts. In this connection I think the proportionate figures are of no assistance in estimating whether the budget will be realized or not, with your permission I will ask the Council to substitute, in future, the actuals of last years collections. It is not known yet Yi /hat will be the effect of the drop in prices of dates, to ^uard against a drop in revenue however I have a^ain impressed on the Council the need of strictest economy. ■hiXPi^iDITUIiK . Total actuals for 8 months plus Shumaliyah expenditure, not yet received, should equal about 4^- lacs, this is well behind the proportionate expenditure figure, on This is in order as the last three months of the yearIih (r2) the other hand, some fairly heavy expenses in connection with Mr# Hed4•cocJc , s passages both from and to England have still to be met. A sum of Rs.21,25a/- is due to His Highness the Sultan for undisbursed pay from January to liay, this, however may not be claimed, Rs.7 t 6y6/- on account of palace rations from January 1921 to April 1951 is due and the Royal Indian Marine will no doubt However, even if all these items had been disbursed actual expenditure would still be below the proportionate figure, while in the next 4 months, a saving of about Rs.12,000/- on the Levy Corps is anticipated. The Council have assured me that any excesses over budget allotments will be adjusted by re-appropriations and will not swell the total.

Proportionate fi^area. 2. Revenue. The collections in whole rupees to date, Rs.4,43,813, are short of the budget proportion, Rs.487,600, by Rs.43,786. This does not include the Shumaliyah District collection which has not been made for August but which is estimated at Rs.2,000. If Shumaliyah estimate is included then the total collections would be Rs.4,43,813 plus Ii»,18,605 plus Rs .2,000* Hs.4,64,418, while the proportionate figures up to date are Re. 5,16,266,i.e. a shortage of s.51,848. 3. The State .therefore, if no further deficits occur, has to make up this sum in the next four monthe e-noe he Muscat financial year closes on 31st Je«emter 1931. Tha Political'30, '7- l&gt;' /^N • 2- Politioal Agent&gt; however, points out that the last 5 months of the year alwaye ehow heaTy receipts# 4* Expenditure. The Shumaliyah expenditure has not been shown for the month under reriew but the proportionate expenditure against this head is shown as Rs«22 f 766 # e may therefore allow (say) Rs«2 # 850 for August which would bring the total actuals up to Re#4 f 28 ,330 plus Rs. 17,822 plus Ss.2,860 » Rs.4,49,062. As the proportionate allotment to date, without the SoTernment of India loan, is Rs#4|87,766 (i»e # &amp;«4, 65 ,000 plus Ss*22,766) a saving is shown in actual expenditure over the proportionate allotment, of H8»38,764 s In this saving are included, however, various outstanding debts as follows: (a) Rs.21,358 due to His Highness for undisbursed pay from January to April 1&gt;931, During these months the reduction of the Sultan 1 s allowance from Rs.XOfOOO to Rs*5,000 was under consideration. His allowance was finally reduced to the latter figure with effect from May# The Political Agent points out that this may not be claimed. (b) Ks.7,696 on account of palace rations from January to April 1931. I do not know why this has not been paid but presume the amount will have to be met* (c) Rs.8,088 due to the Royal Indian Uarine on account of coal for the State gunboat. The total of these debts comes to Rs.37,142 and if these were added to the expenditure a total of Rs.4,86,204 would be obtain* ed which is still Rs. 1,562 less than the proportionate allot ment. 5. For the Government of India loan (vide correspondence ending •. •ending with my letter No«4d7*S 9 dated tlie let August 1931) the GoTernment of India have given a moratorium thi# year* It appears likely, however, that the State will be able to pay It off. 6» The above ahowe that as far as proportionate allotmenta of revenue and expenditure are concerned the poaition of the State ia satisfactory# Actuals. ?• Taking the Actuals of revenue aa compared with Actuala of expenditure the poaition la as followat Total revenue to date including the Shumallyah expectations R8 #4 t 64 # 418.

Thia ia aatiafaotory, 8* With regard to the Political Agenda suggestion that the previoua year*a actuals should be substituted for proportional figures I am of opinion that the proportionate figures are more useful as they facilitate a watch being kept on the financial progress of the State throughout the year* I am, however, aaking the Political Agent • If It would not overburden the returna and involve too much labour - to have the previoua year'a actuala put in aa well* Later on It may be aufflcient for theae returna to be aent in quarterly, but for the present I feel that it ia as well to continue a monthly scrutiny.

Saiyid Said has ii.formed r:.e that he does not see his way to effecting such a substitution nor does he consider that the use of a motor dhow would be at all in consonance with the dignity of the State or its Huier. 4* He would also liie it to be noticed that he has effected all possible economies in the running of the Launch and does not consider the present cost to be excessive# 5. M ith regard to sub-para (2) of para 4, I think there y must be some mistake. In x92S when I was Financial and kilita^ Adviser to the State I once asked Saiyid Taimur, the Sultan, if we might buy a motor dhow for the State. Saiyid Taimur replied that the dignity of the State demanded a stealer and failing that it would be better not to have any boat at all. 6. luscat State has never in the past been without a -w steamer, the last one bein&amp; the '♦Nur al Bahr' while before that there were others, it is therefore quite natural that both the Sultan and nis people should consider that for the ^ state to possess anytnin^ - less tiian a steamer would be undignified. Saiyid Said does not care particularly what steamer he has as lon^, as it is a steamer aiid not a dhow# 6. reference para 5.

An alternative would be to dispose of the 'Al Satd* and replace It with another steamer whose maintenance would cost less« The 'Al Said* however, is unlikely, particularly at the present moment, to find ready sale and would have to be disposed of at a considerable loss« The adoption of this alternative therefore is not feasible at present* I have the honour to be.

Vyith reference to your request for a report on the subject of the finances of the State, I submit the following memorandum# THE ;£SArt 'S WORKING . The monthly financial statements which were initiaoed oy ths I uscat State at my request show clearly the financial progress of the State, and reflect credit on Salyid Said and his Accountant General, Rai Sahib Duli Ghand. The last statement submitted i.e. for the month of November (vide my memorandum No. 1413 of 3th December 1931) shows a balance up to date on the woricing of the last 11 months of receipts over expenditure of Rs.30,456. Saiyid Said informs me that at the end of the present month, which is also the end of the financial year, the State should finish up with a similar credit. .BUDGET FOR 1932 . 3. Vith regard to the Budget for 1932. This will be affected by various factors on which it is practically impossible to prophesy i.e. rise or fall in the world price of commodities, principally « as concerning Lluscat - of rice, sugar, coffee and piece goods; Imports, and dates and fish: Exports; fluctuations in the ^rice of silver whicn affect tii.e dollar; tne imposition of the new tariff rates if sanctioned by America and Prance; and so forth.z. y aEGEItTS. 4. I attach a. Budget /vhicn aaiyid Said lias Jaad made out. The most important ainfele item on the xeceiptb side is the Arms Subsidy of Rs# 100,000. As you are aware this is in danger of being stopped by the Indian Government. I have already expressed my views as to the serious effect on the State finances if this stoppage is actually made and I need not labour the point any further. The other anticipated receipts appear to be based on a conservative estimate o EXirmriTUHS . 2* 1. Civi l List . 1931 Rs.a,66,500. 11132 Rs.2,36,500, i.e. a reduction of iis .30,J00. The estinate for 1^32 includes sm U sh U ls H s # 6,000 p.m# for Saiyid Said as Sultan, but not the Hs.2,000 p.m. as allowance to hie father, xis.6,000 is Hs. 4,000 less tnan was drawn by his father, but Saiyid Said says he will endeavour to carry on . ith this until the financial condition of the State improves. For 1932 re due tion^have been made in tne allowances of the Royal Family of 2^, 3^ and according to salary. The Civil List is still very large,and the fact that Saiyid Kadir, for instance, one of Saiyid Said f s uncles, will still receive more tnan Rs.2,000 p.m. for doing notning, seems anomalous considering the financial condition of the State. The Civil List, however, always bulks large in Ori «ntal Governments: Saiyid Said has initiated reductions, and I dare say will follow them up with others in future years when he is firmly seated in,- the saddle« 2. Gener al A dminstrat ion. 1931 Rs. 150,000, 1932 Rs. 138,140, i .e. a reduction of Rs. 11,^60. This reduction has been effected by cuts in ^ay all round. This is an * omnibus 1 heading and includes a variety of items which might in future years be 3|)iit up, As -^aries for instance being made a sub-heading of Defence. I do not suggest, however, that we v/orry Saiyid Said on the point now# /s • qi^) 7» 5. Custom s and Revenue * 1^31 Rs. 75 # 00U^ 1=»3S R3»a7,D00, i*e» an increase of R3»12,500. In 1^31 Customs Contingencies rws*5,000, and Customs Weighing Fees Rs.3,000, were included under Tuisceilaneous (item 10). In 1932 these expenses have 'been shown under this head. This accounts for Rs.S^OOO of the increase. In addition Rs.12,000 Landing Charges, shown separately in iy31, are shown in 1932 under this, heading, i.e. a total of Ks.20,000. The increase being only Rs.12,500, a saving of Rs.7,500 has been effected by a cut in salary of those drawing over Rs. 50 p.m. on a sliding scale of 3^, 5^' and 10^. £• 4.Marine i.e. The Sta te Gunboat '^A1 S aidi 'i 1931 Rso 30,000, 1932 Rs*2i,000, i.e. a reduction of Rs.^,000, which has been effected by cutting dov/n of personnel and reduction in estimate of coal required. 9. 5 Defence.(Musc at Infantry) . 1931 Rs.94,600, 1932 Rs. 98,000 i.e. an increase of Rs.3,400. This includes a Commandant and a full strengtn of 150 men. The full pay of the Commandant has been shown against this heading. As he will also be Financial Adviser a moiety of this might be debited against General Administration (item 2). The question of the Muscat Infantry has been exhaustively dealt with in many XX despatches. The latest are my Bushire letters to the Government of India No.487«»S of 1st August 19^1, and 1 o.6cc«S of 2nd October 1931. The question still to be decided is whether the basic pay should be iurther reduced to i-ls.^J, and the ration increased (vide my telegram No.277 of 1st December 1931). Saiyid Said, as will be seen, is prepared in his Budget to carry on the present pay, anci pending discussion with you I have said nothing to him about the possibility ol a further cut. 10. 6. iublic Works, 19^1 Ks.^,J00, l»o2 Rs.2j ,DJ0,i .e. an increase of Rs. 20,0-^0. In 19^1 tx-^e saxc^ies o± tins department were included under General Adi-iui sti ation. Ii^4. In 1932 they have 'been brought under this heading. Honey is badly required for the up-keep of the present Muscat-Matrah road and for extension of the proposed roads to Sahar and Sur. Forts are an important item and have to be kept in repair, and a new Customs house has been built at Sur. 11. 7.Education . 1931 Rs.15,000, 1932 Rs.14,600, i.e. a reduction of Rs. 1,400. I thinjc some economies might be made under this heading. Education and books etc are free and small school fees might be levied^ The terms of the teachers too, which include 4 months ^eave every year on full pay -with travelling expenses to and from Palestine, which is their home, are rather extravagant. Their con tracts are up in lay and Saiyid Said informs me that new contracts will be made, possibly with schoolmasters from Iraq on less expensive lines. I suggested to him that while free education might be given in the lower classes, in the upper ones fees might be charged. He seemed to welcome the suggestion. 12. 8* quarantine . 1931 Rs.2,400, 1932 Rs.7,000, i.e. an increase of Ks.4,600. This is due to repairs of Quarantine Station and an increase in staff. It is proposed to put a Quarantine Doctor at Gwadur where at present there are no medical arrangements. This fund is raised by the payment of Rs.5 tai^en on every passenger disembarking at lluscat. The fund is ear-marked for Quarantine purposes, up-keep of Quarantine Station, payment of Quarantine liedical Officer etc, and cannot be used for other purposes# 13. 9. Pensions . 1931 Rs.9,00U, 1932 R6.10,000. This is a fund from which members of the Al Bu Said tribe are paid who have done service for the State. 14 # 10.Miscellaneous . In 1931 Rs.30,000, 1»32 Rs. 17,500, i.e. a reduction of Rs .12,500. In 1^31 a total of Hs.8,0u0 was shown against this heading. In 1932 this sum has been charged against Customs (see item 3). In 1^31 R s.d,ou0/w. • s - (5?) ior Ceremonies, Ides and Missions ^ere snown under this heading® In 1932 this has been put under General Adminstration (Council of Ministers)® This ^ives an actmal increase under this heading of Rs.1,000. 1 ^ i• oahar• 1931 xis»»i3,^00, 19«^2 xis*20,4:00f i• c• decrease of Hs*13 &gt; 500. This district has only been recently brought under effective control, as previously Saiyid aaid^ uncle, whom he deposed last spring from the l¥aliship, exercised quasi independent rule theret main tained an extravagant administration,and remitted very little to the Muscat Treasury. An appreciable reduction has been made in the esti .ii .ated expenditure. 12 Debts . A list of debts which the S4ate will owe on the 31st of the month is attached® Items 5 and 7 are due to Government. If conditions are favourable Saiyid Said informs me that the former will be ^aid off in the fir*t half of i952 and the latter during the course of the year. Items 1-4 are due to merchants* About Rs.5,000 of this will be paid off during 1932, and the balance - if conditions are favourable - in 1933-o4. It .vill be noted that item 2 is creditable to K.E.Nassib &amp; Son, as Saiyid Said informs me that this amount has probably been paid by Nassib &amp; Son to the Sultan for whom they acted as a sort of private bankers* In any case this is a matter for adjustment between the State and Nassib &amp; Son, or the Sultan. Item 6* The State will endeavour to pay this off during the course of 1932. To sum up . The balance on the yea^s working will be about Rs.30,000 (para 2). Outstanding debts will come to about 2 laichs (para 16). Those due to Government will be paid off in the course of 1932, and those due/tl (life) to mcrcii&amp;nta in 1^53-54, If conditions are reasonaoly favourable the State should be completely solvent by tJae 'beginning of 1^35 (para 16). The Budget for 1^32 will be affected by various factors on wmch it is Impossible to prophesy (para 3). On the Receipts side the most important individual item is the Arms Subsidy. The receipts generally, as far as I can judge, seem to be based on a conservative estimate (para 4). The total expendi ture for 1931 will be about Rs.705,660. This includes various cuts which were made in the course of the year. The expend!** ture for 1932 is estimated to be Hs.676,300 ( deducting the debts) i.eo reduction of Rs.29,360, wnich has been effected by various further cuts in pay all round. The most important item from our point of view is No.5,Defence (Muscat Infantry), and the point has to be settled whether the basic pay should be further reduced to Hs.20 p.m. (para a'). Some ox the items, ( for instance No. 13 pensions which as far as I can majce out is restricted, to members of the Al Bu Said tribe, i.e. the one may to which the Royal family belongs),.appear abnormal from a western point of view. But we are not dealing with a ^art of British India, we are not even dealing with an Indian State, our concern is with an independent Arabian Sultanate whose stability for various reasons, political and strategical, is important to us, but in whose affairs we want to interfere as little as possible, provided that this stability is assured. This being so, subject to any remarks that Captain Alban, the new Financial Adviser, has to maiwc, I thin.ii we may give the Budget, which seems to be the best possible under present Q;[,i»Qu.m.gtances, and which reilects credit on Saiyic. Saiu and his Accountant General, our approval. r c ' Laj or, iolitical Agent &amp; H.B.I*6 Consul, lluscat.u(l&gt;/ ^2 To No.17/17/ 67 of 1932.

Actuals. 4. Actual Revenue for the 3 months is Rs. 168,973 Actual expenditure do ' 190,795 Excess of expenditure orer Revenue ' 21,8222. With reference to Captain Alb&amp;n^ letter. Briefly the situation is as follows# Two expenditure items, Rs.10,688 and Rs• 21,198, must be deducted from the exx^enditure for the quarter in order to arrire at the working expenditure of the State for this period: the first because it is an adTance of pay and the second because it is payment of a loan. If this deduction, Rs«32,866/-, is made we find that the working expenditure from January to March comes to Rs.157,909, while the receipts come to Rs.168,973 which leares a credit balance of nearly Rs.10,000/-. Debts The R.I.M.Coal Bill about which the Government of India were pressing has, as you will see, been paid up in full, and Rs.lS.OOO has been paid towards the Govern ment of India loan. The large debit balance of Rs.177,506 still remains but it is distinctly encouraging that the State, in spite of the financial stringency prevailing, has been able to pay off during the quarter the not inconsiderable sum of over Rs.21,000/-o At the same time it must be noted that while the State made an allowance of Hs.50,015 for proportionate repayment of debts and loans during the quarter, a sum of Rs.21,198 only has actually been paid* Treasury Balance. 6.

Rs.1,68,973-7 with the expenditure (Col.5j fur the same period i.e. Hs.1,90,795-9, it would appear as if a sum of Rs.21,822-2 has been over- expended. 3. This sum of Hs.21,822-2 is made up as follows;- (1) Advances of Privy Purse and salaries to n .H. the ^ultan and party on proceeding to ^hufar (recoverable) Rs. 9,853 (2) Repayment of instalments on loans and debts ' 21,198-4 Total of (i) &amp; (2) H 31,051 -4 In order therefore to obtain a true comparison between actual revenue and actual expenditure, the above amount should be deducted from the total expenditure which thus amounts to Ks.l,90,795-9 less ' 31,051 -4 i.e. actual expenditure 1,59,744-5 while revenue (col.5) amounted to H 1,68,973-7 thus the excess of Kevenue over expenditure is 9,229-2. If this excess is now sub^tracted from the sum of items (l) and (2} above, the result will be Rs. 31,051 -4 less excess of Revenue over Expenditure 9,229-2 Result equals 21,822-2 which is the same as tne figure of apparent excess expendi ture obtained in para 2 above. 4. The position therefore is that the Btate expenditure for the first quarter of the year has exceeded the Revenue for the same period by a sum of Rs.21,822-2 which consist^ of (a) advances of pay to .11.H. the Sultan and party-o vr 2. .

In 1921, however, in consiaering the question of the reduction of the Arms traffic Sub^i^y ( 5 1 - &lt;Sc?.L. letter No. 496-E.A., dateu 14/V21 ) tne Political Agen ' Muscat, expressea the view that the Zanzibar subsiay w? was, subject to certain conditions / ( not clearly defin- -ed) / the right of any Sultan recognizea by the British Government (ifrascat letter No. 697, aateo 29/b/^l). This view was concurred in by tne Politicax Resiuent (his despatch No. 136-S, aatea 13/6/21) and, it may be assumeo, by the (jovernment of India, who ins true tea the Resiaent ( F. &amp; ?.!&gt;. memo. No. Ib43-E.A., aatea 29/12/21} in reply to the 'Resiaent's letter, to ex- -plain to the Sultan the terms oi botn tne Zanzibar ana the Arms Traffic Subsiaies. But, presumaoly by oversight, for there is nothing to explain the omission, neither the Political Agent*? communication to the Sultan ( No. 5-C, dated 24/2/23) nor the Resiaent's similar communication later ( No. 137, aateci 21/4/23) explainea the nature of the Zanzioar suosiay; both letters were confined to explanation of tne per- -sonal nature of the Arms Traf f ic Subtiay. THE ARMS TRAFFIC SUBSIDY . This subsidy was originally granted to Saiyid Faisal bin Turki in 1911 as compensation for loss of revenue arising from his cooperation in the suppressionof the Arams traffic in the Persian Gulf. It was apparently not clearly explained at the time to Saiyia Faisal that the subsidy was personal to him vide Political Agent, Muscat's, letter No. 32-C, aated 22/9/22. On the death of Saiyid Faisal it was decided to continue the subsidy to Saiyid ^aimur on certain conditions.
