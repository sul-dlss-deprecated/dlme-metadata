Dated 2£&gt;th reoeived 26th October 1935* , V Buehire telegram 874 October 23rd* f Juridical iaoue aa regards Kuwait* Bahrain and TrucUl Coast shaikhs is subject to some ambiguity though we doubt, in view of control of external relations of these States by His ttajesty*s Government, whether position as stated by Fowle in paragraph 4 of his tslsgram under refer ence needs to bs accspted. As, however, His Majesty's Government will presumably consider it desirable that in all matters relating to external relatlor e, including application of a^ net ions, Arab State a should fall into line with policy of HU Majesty'a Government as Member of League, and aa moreover adherence to sanctions coincides with undoubted local ^ sentiment (see Dickson's intelUgencs No* 16 of 1933) we consider that Rulers should be advised to apply sanctions simultaneously with Members of eountrlss of Ltagus of $ tic ns. It should not bs difficult for Resident to eecure the tilers' adherence to general League policy as proeesding from thsir own initiative. ; a are confirmed In thie opinion by consideration that local dislocation of trade should be negligible and that strength of Arab opinion against Italy might, if trade with Italy were permitted to continue in the face of sanctions, lead to poesible disturbance at time of visits2 of Xt&amp;li*D ▼osools to Gulf ports* Position of Muscat os independent •oTorsign Stats *n Treaty relations with His Majesty^ QoTerriment is of course different but we think it aiaost certain that Sultan, for reasons of sentiment giTtn obove if for no other cause, would be prepared to fall into line in application of sanctions just as he did In the ease of Arms Convention* 4* In applying sanction* Rulers would presumably follow procedure, so far as it is appropriate, detailed in your telegram of the 82nd October 5585 which we are repeating to Resident* foreignI III ; = - 0 &gt;r ?«l«gr*w *n «lrir.

J 6951/5499/1. S.tf.l. 1st November, 1955. Immediat e . • • * - - Confident ial. Sir, The I am directed by Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare to invite reference to your letters P.Z.7656 and 7701/1935 of October 24th and 26th regarding the application of sanctions against Italy by the rulers of Arab States on the Persian Gulf, and to inform you that he considers it inadvisable on political grounds that any action should be taKen at the present time to secure the co-operation of the States in question. 2. In arriving at this decision Sir Sameel Hoare has been •t; ^ influenced by the consideration that in the present inflamed state of public opinion in Italy it is preferable to avoid any step likely to be misinterpreted as a further and gratuit ous attempt on the part of His Majesty’s Government to inspire hostility to Italy on the part of foreign countries. This is more particularly the case when the countries in question are not in a position to contribute in any appreciable measure to the successful operation of the sanctions already in force or in contemplation. In this connection, I am to refer to the remarks of Signor Mussolini as quoted in Rome telegram No.670 of October 30th concern .ng the pressure alleged to have been exerted by His Majesty’s Government upon such countries as Venezuela. These remarks illustrate Italian sensitiveness in regard to the influencing of League members, and afford an indication of the resentment likely to be caused by any attempt to persuade States not members of that body to apply sanctions. 3. 1 am to request that the Government of India may be advised accordingly.
