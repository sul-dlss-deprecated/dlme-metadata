Sphere of Jurisdiction. 1. For the purposes of this Report, the territories over which this Residency exercises political supervision, or with which it has relations, may be classified in the following order :— 1. —The Muscat State, or Principality of Oman. 2. —The Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf and adjacent islands, exclusive of Muscat and Turkish territory. Indepen dent Chiefdoms. 3. —El-Bahrein. Independent. 4 . —Nejd and El-Katr. More or less under Turkish rule. 5. —Province of Pars and coasts and islands of the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, subject to Persia. 6. —Bassidore. British Station. 1.— Oman. 2. A report on the territories under the rule of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee has been prepared, as usual, by the Political Agent of Muscat, and forms Parts III and IV of this compilation. 3. It will be observed that in the month of May a serious, and to the Sultan dangerous, crisis occurred, which w r as only weathered by the active intervention of the British representative and Naval officers. The manner in which the crisis was met by Mr. Robertson, then Acting Political Agent, with the able co-operation of Captain Wodehouse, Commanding Her Majesty’s Ship Teazer, was highly creditable to those officers, and received the approval of the Government. Mr. Robertson had the advantage of the presence and advice of Lieutenant-Colonel Miles on the occasion. Certain recommendations were submitted to Government by the Acting Political officers regarding the levy of indemnity from the rebellious Arabs, which proposals are still under reference. 4. The political condition of this country and Government is not as yet one of security, and a vessel of war has been kept almost con stantly on the watch over Muscat. The Political Agent notices that emigration has set in from Oman, the mother country, to the Zanzibar territories. 5. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee is desirous of the establishment of telegraphic communication between Muscat and the more civilized world, and the measure w r ould carry certain political and other advan tages. 2 .—Arab Coast. 6. The Oman Coast of the Persian Gulf, now referred to, is divided into little independent communities of Arabs, each governed by its Chief, or Shaikh. Six of these petty Chiefdoms are bound by engage-AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1877-78. 3 mcnts to tli6 British Government to submit to r certain control as 'regards their maritime proceedings; otherwise they own allegiance to noiie. The rulers of these little States are commonly described as the “ Trucial Chiefs ” and are— * 1. —Hameyd-bin-Abdallah, Jowasimee, Chief of Ras-el-Khei- mah. 2. —Ahmed-bin-Abdallah, Al-bu-Ali, of Umm-el-Kawain. 3. —Rashid-bin-Hameyd, Al-bu-Ali, of Ejman. 4. —Salim-bin-Sultan, Jowasimee, of Shargah. 5. —Hashar-bin-Maktoom, Al-bu-Falasah, of Dabai. 6. —Zaeed-bin-Khaleefah, Beni-Yas, of Abu-Zhabi. 7. These Chiefs continue to evince their sincere desire and readi ness to adhere to their engagements, aud no disturbances have occurred on the seas. 8. Inland, however, where British influence cannot be authorita tively exerted to restrain their warlike propensities, these are freely indulged, as the following record of the past year’s petty warfare will show. May 1877.—One hundred camel-riders and fifty horsemen of the El-Monasir and Beni-Majir raid on a village named Zaeed, plunder it and kill three men. The Monasir plunder another village. July, Beni-Amir tribe attack Dabai, are repulsed with loss of forty killed and eight captured, Dabai losing two killed and ten wounded. August .—The Beni-Katab, seventy strong, attack the Beni-\as, kill four men and capture twenty beasts. September .— Beni-Katab attack a village near Abu-Zhabi, and kill four men. Beni-Yas of Dabai attack and plunder a Beni-Katab village. October .—Four hundred of the Awamir and Daroowa, and Bmii' Katab attack and plunder a Dabai village. Beni-Yas 6f Abu-Zhabi attack and loot a Beni-Katab village, carrying off 100 camels and 3,000 head of cattle. Beni-Katab attack Dibba (under Shargah) kill seven men, and seize twenty camels. November .—Dabai people plunder a Beni-Katab village. December. —Beni-Yas of Dabai attack the people of Ghufla and seize camels of the Beni-Katab. Beni-Katab retaliate and lose two men killed. February 1878.—Eighty men of the Beni-Katab raiding towards Dabai, kill seven Beloochees of eight met. 9. In February all parties having become weary of strife, a general peace was arranged, which still continues. 10. In the Report for the preceding year reference was made to the trouble caused by the detached settlement of a body of the Beni-Yas tribe at the inlet of Odeyd. The seceders from Abu-Zhabi renounced allegiance to the head of their tribe, and defied his authority. The4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCE result was that Odeyd became a resort of piratically inclined Bedouins, such as the Beni-Hajir, and the Beni-Yas settlers became implicated in irregular proceedings on the sea. To check this growing evil, as well as in justice to the Trucial Chief of Afcu-Zhabi, it was decided by the Government of India that he should be permitted to assert his rightful authority at Odeyd and be supported in doing so. Efforts to promote a friendly reconciliation between the Chief and the refrac tory elan proved of no avail, and permission was accorded to Shaikh Zaeed to take measures to assert his rights at Odeyd. The British Agent was instructed to accompany the Chief of Abu-Zhabi to Odeyd, and the Resident also proceeded to the spot in Her Majesty’s Ship Teazer to exercise control over the proceedings, and, if necessary, to intervene; but especially with the resolve to prevent any undue severities or cruelties being resorted to. 11. The Odeyd tribe, however, removed from the place before the arrival of the Abu-Zhabi Chief and the Teazer, after dismantling their huts. As the Chief of Abu-Zhabi objects to any renewed settlement at Odeyd, the place will remain uninhabited; and the wells having been filled up, there will be no further attraction for predatory Arabs of the neighbourhood to resort there. The Abu-Zhabi Chief, on his side, acknowledges that he has now no plea for exemption from respon sibility for the good order of that part of his territory. 12. The next port to the north on the Katr Coast is Wakrah, the Chief of which has no treaty relations with the British Government, and is supposed to claim the Turkish connection. Between Odeyd and Wakrah intervenes a desert unpeopled waste. 3 .— Bahrein. 13. The Chief of these islands having during the year enjoyed immunity from the apprehensions he has so often laboured under, from the intrigues of external enemies, might be supposed to have leisure to apply hirpself to the improvement of his internal administration. But in point of fact this seems to have been more slack and careless than usual, and petty robberies have so frequently occurred and passed unpunished, that I considered it necessary, for the comfort and safety of the Indian subjects residing in the islands, as well as in the interests of the Chief himself, to urge on him the necessity of more vigour and strictness in his government. Sheikh Fahad-bin-Ahmed, cousin of the father of the present Chief, Eesa-bin Ali, having been accused, or suspected, of intriguing against the Government, was put to death by Sheikh Ahmed-bin Ali, the Chief’s brother, and his personal effects confiscated. Two other murders have occurred during the year. Haji Abdallah Ghallaf, once Wazeer, was found murdered in his house, and some suspicion is said to rest on the present Wazeer, but no steps have been taken to bring home the guilt. The other victim was a villager, who was killed by a party of robbers, who have not been traced or discovered. 14. The pearl banks were as productive as usual, but bad weather interfered with the diving operations, and half the season was lost.AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1877-78. 5 4.— Nejd. 15. No change has occurred in the political position of Nejd. The Turkish Government are in occupation of El-Alisa and the sea-ports, whilst Abdallah-bin-Feysal is at Riadh. The project at present in favour is to promote a reconciliation between Abdallah and the Turkish authorities, in view to his being made Governor of El-Ahsa on the part of the Porte. Some negotiations are going on in this sense. 5 .—Province of Furs and the Persian Coast and Islands. 16. His Royal Highness Prince Ferhad Mirza, titled “ Mo'Temid- ed-Dowleh/ , remains Governor-General of Ears, and has succeeded in maintaining the security of the routes in a perfectly unprecedented manner. The Prince has a very efficient assistant in his son Prince Awais Mirza, the “ Ihtisham-ed-Dowlah,” Governor of Behbehan, who usually makes a tour yearly through the southern districts of Fars. The restoration and maintenance of good order has not been accomplished without recourse to severities, a record of which would not be agreeable reading. 17. The British Agent at Shiraz, Mirza Hassan Ali Khan, pro ceeded in March, under the orders of the Government, to Tehran on special duty, and has been succeeded temporarily by his brother Hyder Ali Khan. 18. The weekly Persian post, wdiich has been established between Bushire and the north, has been worked excellently. Further particulars will be stated under the postal heading. A census was ordered to be taken throughout Fars this year. Bushire .—Ilaji Ismail Khan, the Deputy Governor of Bushire, has been relieved by Agha Mohammed Bakir Khan, the present Governor. The “ Ihtisham-ed-Dowlah,” who has a general supervision of all the southern districts of this vicinity, visited Bushire in February, and proceeded to Shiraz by way of Dashti and Ear. 19. The relations with the local Government have been of a satisfactory nature, and cases arising have been disposed of readily. 20. An event in. the annals of Bushire is the death of the prin cipal Persian merchant, Agha Mohammed Ali, styled the “ Melik-et- Toojar,” who was reputed to be the richest private person in Persia. He died childless, and his property has devolved on his elder brother, Haji Baba, a naturalized British Indian subject now residing at Bushire. 21. A grain riot occurred, said to have been at the instigation of certain Mujtahids, or priests, and some wheat belonging to a British Indian subject was plundered. The Acting Resident took prompt and judicious measures, and the ringleaders were arrested, punished, and forced to pay the full value of the grain stolen. Here, as at other ports of the Persian Coast, there is a prohibition on the export of grain, which is very largely evaded. Mohammed Hassan Khan, Chief of Borazjan, has been kept prisoner at Shiraz, and one of his sons was put to death there by order of the Governor-General.6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY 22. Hyder Khan, Chief of Dashtee, who has frequently been a source of annoyance to the authorities, declined to come in to the camp of the Ihtisham-ed-Dowlah at Bushire, but decided to proceed to Shiraz under assurances of pardon for past shortcoming’s. His brother, Mohammed Khan, presented himself before the Ihtisham-ed-Dowlah, and proposed to supersede Hyder Khan. The latter has since died at Shiraz, an event which has given rise to what may be considered unfounded, though not unusual supicions.* 23. Coast from Bushire to Lingah .—The Shaikh of Congoon, Mazkoor Khan, was taken to Shiraz as prisoner, and his districts made over to one Mohammed Hassan Khan; but the latter was detected in treasonable practises, and after administration of the usual course of sticks, or bastinado, was sent to Shiraz a piisoner, “ encourager les autres.” 24. Shaikh Mazkoor has now been reinstated as Governor of Congoon, on payment of 100,000 Krans. He has since paid up a long standing claim for indemnity due to some Indian subjects who were wrecked on his coast. 25. Lingah .—The youthful Shaikh of Lingah, an Arab by descent, has no bed of roses, as the central authorities interfere more directly than of yore, and financial pressure is likely to check the prosperity the port acquired under the more liberal ancient system, when the Shaikhs were more independent of control. The revenues were let to the Wazcer, Mohammed Hassan Khan, at an enhanced rate, but that in dividual found the people prepared to fly the place, and was glad to sub-let to the Chief, Shaikh Ali-bin-Khaleefah, at a loss. Even the reduced rate proved impracticable, and the Shaikh's YVazeer became the scape-goat, and was exiled with the loss of his private means. 2G. Bunder Abbass .—The Government of this port and its attached districts, including the islands of Kishm, Ormuz, Larek, and Henjam, and the coast as far as Jashk, has been farmed by the “ Nasseer-ul-Moolk,' who administers through a Deputy Governor. This Government, as well as that of' Lingah, is subordinate to the central Government of Ears. The Foreign Office Agent, Mirza Abdallah, has lately returned to his post from Shiraz. The Shaikh of Kishm, Shaikh Sakar, has not given further trouble, as regards British interests, but the inhabitants of Kishm charged him with habitual oppression, and an investigation was ordered by the Prince Governor- General of Ears, which resulted in a decision favourable to the Shaikh, which is said, however, to have been an expensive purchase. Shaikh Sakar is not likely to rule long over Kishm, as he is in an advanced stage of consumption, and recently went to Muscat for treatment. 27. A few years ago a Hindoo trader of Bunder Abbass absconded to Kerman, where he embraced the Mohammedan religion. Hie man having defrauded his partners and other Indian traders of a * Xote. —A common Persian euphemism implies popular ascription to the ruling dynasty, at some time of addiction to practical applicatiou of toxicological science. The draught prepared for the philosopher of Athens would, in the bazaars of Shiraz, be delicately termed ' Shorba-i-Hajari” “Kajar, broth.”AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1877 - 78 . 7 large sura, his surrender to British authority became necessary, but for long the Kerman authorities evaded compliance, and the case caused much trouble to the British Legation. Eventually the firm insistance of Her Majesty’s Minister prevailed, and the convert was made over to the Acting Resident, tried, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 28. Persian-Baloochistan Coast. —The eastern boundary of Persia having &gt; at a recent time, been formally defined, under special agree ment between the British and Persian Governments, there is now no reserve requisite in indicating the actual Persian territories in that direction. From Cape Jashk eastwards to Gwetter Bay the whole coast is now under Persian subjection, but the districts are not directly administered by Persian officials, but left in the hands of the petty Balooch Chiefs. The jurisdiction of the Government of Fars extends to Jashk, and there terminates. Persian-Baloochistan forms part of the Government of Kerman, and is more immediately under the Governor of Bampoor, now, once more, in the hands of the irrepressible Ibrahim Khan. 29.

This station has remained under the superintendence of Assist ant Surgeon Abder Rahim hakim. The health has been generally good, and no matters have occurred requiring notice. , t Establishments. 31. Political. —Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux, the Officiating Poli tical Resident, having proceeded on furlough in August, Major Grant, 1st Assistant, was appointed to act, and was relieved in November by Lieutenant-Colpnel Ross. Mr. J. C. Edwards proceeded on six months’ private leave in April and rejoined in November. Captain E. A. Fraser officiated from May to August as 2nd Assistant. Major Grant was transferred to India in March, and has been succeeded by Captain E. L. Durand. Mr. G. Lucas officiated as 2nd Assistant from May to November. Medical. —Surgeon D. R. Ross succeeded Surgeon Lucas as Civil Surgeon of Bushire. 32. Naval. — Her Majesty’s Ships Rifleman, Teazer, Arab, and Daphne have served on the station during the past year, chiefly at Muscat and Busrah. 33. The ordinary Residency steamer having been withdrawn, at the request of the Officiating Resident, the I. G. Steamer Balhousie was stationed in the Gulf from May to August, when that vessel was with-8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY drawn, and no political vessel has since been in the Gulf. It is hoped that the removal of the political service vessel is temporary, as the duties are of such a nature as to require the services of a special vessel. Represent ations have accordingly been made on this subject. 34. Judicial. —By Notification No. 2161P., dated 7th of September 1877 His Excellency the Governor-General in Council was pleased to delegate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf the powers and jurisdiction of a Magistrate of the 1st class, to be exercised over Native Indian subjects of Her Majesty, within the undermentioned territories in which he is accredited as the representative of the British Govein- ment: the coast line from Gwadur westward to the Persian Cult, all the shores of the Persian Gulf, and Gulf of Oman with the islands situated in these Gulfs, and the territories of the Sultan of Muscat in Arabia; and further to delegate to the Resident the powers and jurisdiction of a Sessions Judge within the same tenitones. 35. Other measures are in course of consideration by Ilei Majesty’s Government, in view to supplying the defects still existing, as regards the powers and functions of this Residency. Steps have been taken to commence the registration of British subjects, European and Indian. 36 Postal. —Some official and other letters were found to have miscarried between Bushire and India, and the inquiries which were instituted failed to elicit the cause of this miscarriage as yet. 37 The new Persian postal service being worked in a thoroughly efficient manner, and the rates being moderate, has proved a great con venience to the community. From Bushire, letters weighing somewhat over a tola can be sent to Shiraz for a penny; and letters of half an ounce o-o to all parts of Europe for two pence half penny. Here, at least, is one tangible and useful result of the new ideas caught up during the Shah’s tour in Europe. I have thought Appendix C. rna y k e use ful to give the Tabular Statement of the Persian postal rates which will be found in the Appendix. 38. Observatory at Bushire.—In the spring of 1876, with the sanction of the Government of India, an Observatory was established at the Bushire Residency, in connection with the Meteorological Depart ment of India. Some remarks and * Appendix A. Tables will be found annexed* bearing on the climate of Bushire as observed during the past year. Slave-trade. 39. Reports have been submitted to the Government of all matters connected with slave importation which have come to light, and m some instances orders are still awaited. 40. The present convention with Persia for the suppression of this traffic is somewhat defective. But if a more suitable engagemen cannot be obtained, it may be desirable that the existing orders of His Majesty the Shah be republished. (Sd.) E. C. Ross, Lieut.-Col., Resident, Persian Gulf.and muscat political agency for the year 1877-78. 9 Appendix A to Part 1. Remarks on the climate of Busline t and Tables. From the 1st of the following tables it may be seen, by any curious for information, that the north-westerly winds greatly predominate at Bushire, and that there is a free movement of the air throughout the year. By this merciful dispensation are the sufferings of summer residents tempered, and existence rendered possible. In June and July, when the heat has become unendurable, it is interrupted by the advent of what is termed the il Barih ” or “ Shemal, ” vulgarly corrupted into “ Burra Shemal.” This wind is apparently, and according to Arab works, the Simoom of the Arabian continent, which blowing here over the upper part of the Gulf loses its scorching heat, dhe Baiih lasts usually from some time in June till well on in July, with an interval of lull. This wind is apparently influenced by the Indian monsoon. The observations of the barometer are not given, as th« record could not be relied on. It must be noted that the rainfall of the past year is estimated from a new instrument, the relative capacity of the receiver of which to the measure is different from that of the gauge used in previous years.

Recent contributions to our Geographical and General information about Persia and adjacent countries. Travels and researches. There has been a vast deal written about the Persian Kingdom, touching almost every conceivable subject of interest, from weighty histories down to the lightest gossip and tales of travel. The supply still increases day by day, and the future writer of a really accurate and comprehensive history of Persia, with some pretension to scientilie method, will have to cull from a wide field of literature. Much very useful, sound, and interesting information has, during the last few years, been collected, and made accessible, through the exertions, active and literary, of British officers, and private travellers. The former, in some instances travelling on official missions, and in others for their own satisfaction. Several travellers of other countries, official and private, have added valuable contributions, and are still doing so. From the well-known mission under Sir Frederic Goldsmid, resulted a work on Eastern Persia enriched with scientific information, contributed by Mr. Blanford, and several new maps of previously unexplored tracts, by Majors St. John and Lovett. The best map we possess of Persia was recently published, under authority of Government, by Major St. John, the result of many years travel and research. A map of part of Persia has been compiled by a German explorer, Dr. Haussknecht, and a small new map of Persia was published last year in Germany by Petermann. Still, however, a great extent of the south of Persia is, as far as we are concerned, terra incognita, and all fresh information, of a trustworthy nature, is welcome. I have been, therefore, agreeably surprised to discover the existence of a very detailed M.S. map of the southern districts of Persia, in leisian, executed by Haji Mirza Seyyid Hassan, the Hakim-Bashi, or Physician, to H. R. H. the Ihtisham-ed-Dowlah, Governor ol Behbehan. The author of this map, which, by the way, is not quite finished, has been travelling in Fars, in the suite of the Ihtisham-ed-Dowlah. for more than twelve years, during which time he has been labouring at the compilation of it. As he has some knowledge of surveying, and has entered much of his map from actual observation, it cannot fail to have considerable value. I was shown this drawing, but, as the Governor was on the eve of departure, could only obtain a rough tracing of the course of the chief rivers of the south, as laid down by the Haji. I see no reason to doubt that, on the whole, these are tolerably correctly shown, and in fact all other trustworthy information, and the previous conjectures of Major St. John and‘'myself tend to confirm this. The river which chiefly interests us, from the absence hitherto of all accurate information about its real course and termi nation, is what, for want of any general modern name, I may call the ancient “ Silakus*,” and which in * Or Sitakos, m&lt;2e addl. note, p. 13. g^. John's map is at its upper part f Vide note, p. 13. na med the Kara-Aghatchf River [signi fying “Blackwood']. The identity of this with the river which12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OE THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY flows, undoc the name of the Mand or Mund, or Kakee River, into the Khor Ziaret, in Uashti, may now be confidently asserted. It has, as laid down, on the Haji’s map, a course of at least 300 miles, and no doubt, if followed up from mouth to source, the distance would be found much greater. The source of this considerable river is near Kodiyan, north-west of Shiraz. My personal acquaintance with it consists in having, in common with all travellers of the Bushire-Sluraz road, crossed it at Khan-i-Zinyan; and again I crossed it at Kewar, where it is known as the Kewar River. 1 also explored the creek ot Khor Ziaret, where it debouches for twelve miles. Of other European travellers, the same river was crossed by M. Rivadeneyra in 1S75 at Taduan, and previously by Keith Abbott, still further south, in the Kir District. Thence its career has been matter of conjecture, and it is only by the Haji’s map that the gap is filled. The accompanying sketch of the river and its affluents is from that source. In 1874-75 Senor Rivadeneyra, a Spanish officer, with the rank of Consul in Persia, made an extensive tour in Persia. Starting from Teheran, he traversed Western Persia, through Luristan and Khuzistan to Mohammerah; he then proceeded through Rushire to Shiraz, and thence to Firozabad, Darab, Kerman, and Yezd. This gentleman is now preparing an account of his observations for publication in Spanish at Madrid. Lieutenant-Colonel Macgrcgor, about the same time, made a private tour in the east of Persia and collected further information for his valuable Gazetteer. The same year Mr. Mackenzie of the firm of Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co., explored the Ispahan-Shuster route, and wrote an useful account of it. Another enterprising English officer, Mr. Ernest Floyer, of the Persian Gulf Telegraph Department, started from Jask, and penetrated through the unexplored region of Bashakird to Kerman, whence he proceeded to Ispahan and Baghdad. I his gentleman is also preparing an account of his travels and surveys. Some four years ago a gentleman of German nationality, Dr. F. C. Andreas, under the patronage of the Prussian Government and the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin, undertook to conduct an Arshmologic-Epigraphic exploration in Persia, and has been since at work in the province of Fars. The main original object of this expe dition is understood to have been the search for, and copying of, inscriptions in the ancient Pahlavi characters, but the researches of Dr. Andreas and his associate Dr. Stolze have extended to a wide range of subjects, and they are understood to have amassed a great deal of interesting information connected with the archaeology, geography, philology, zoology, ethnography, history, and statistics of Fars. The discoveries of these savants will be illustrated by a series of typical photographic portraits of specimens of each tribe, which it is thought will prove a valuable contribution to scientific ethnography. A vast number of ancient bricks with cuneiform inscriptions were excavated by Dr. Andreas from a mound near Bushire, but the Persian (Govern ment have refused permission for the removal ol the collection from Persia. I may mention that I recently presented a few bricks, foundAND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1877-78. 13 at the same mound, to the British Museum, and they were pro nounced to be in the Elamite character, amongst them— (1.) Of Urtaki, King of Elam, B. C. U64. (2.) Silkhak, King of Jura, B. C. 700. (3.) Babylonian bricks of later periods. In Oman Lieutenant-Colonel Miles has given an account of the route between Sohar and Bereymi, and has collected materials for a more complete map of that country than we now possess. Major Mockler, the Political Agent for the Mekran Coast, has made many very interesting archaeological discoveries in that quarter, and has succeeded in identifying beyond dispute many of the places mentioned in arrian's account of Nearchus* voyage. This officer has compiled and published a grammar of the Balooch language, “ facile princeps” of the few others yet existing, and a work displaying much ability and originality of thought. The intimate knowledge Major Mockler has acquired of the people of Mekran and their language has enabled him to obtain much rare and interesting information bearing on their history and ethnography, and he is not without hope of clearing by decisive evidence the question of the original home ol the Balooch. However baffling such inquiries may prove, still N ote&lt; —River Kara-Aghach. —No district of precisely this name having been known by European geographers hitherto, the derivation of the name, as applied to the river, has been in doubt. The Persian communication from Ur. Andreas that tbe lorm “ Karah-Aghaj” is correct, and further that besides the primary meaning of “ Black wood” the term also applies to the “ elm tree.” “ Sahra-i-Karah-Aghaj” may therefore be rendered as “ Elm tree plain.” Additional Note. —Since writing the preceding observations I have been favoured with a very interesting communication from Dr. Andrass, which I give in his own words, being responsible only for the English rendering of the quotations from the Arabic authors. Notes on the Kara-Aghach* River by Dr. F. C. Andreas. The name of the Kara-Aghaeh River is explained by the people, even without asking them, by “ Chob-i-Siyah, i.e } black wood, which is * Note .— As the name of a locality Kara-Aghach is found in the sarhad of the Kashgai near Dana.—F.

V. map of Haji* Mirza Seyyid Hassan, however, has a locality south-east of ^ghaj” s-I.pi 3,5 . I gather from a14 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY a literal translation of the Turkish name; but besides this literal meaning, “ Karah-Aghaj” is the Turkish name for the elm tree [Ulmus]. As far as 1 know, there is near the river no district or place which is called Kara-Aghach, and from which its name could have been derived. But I think that the name must have originated from the fact that at some place near the river, most probably near its source, a greater number of elms is to be found, or was so in former times. An example of a locality named after trees of which now not a single one is any more to be found, is the “ Desht-i-Safiddar ”—“ the plain of poplars”—in the country of the Rustam Mammassani. With the excep tion of two or three solitary willow trees, not a single tree is to be seen in this place. The sources of the Kara-Aghach River are to be found in a locality, as far as I have been able to ascertain, without fixed habitations, called Bun-Ru, id est, Bun-Rud, a name sufficiently significant, and visited by members of the small group of Iliyat tribes known by the name of Chehar-Bonicheh.* The most important fact which I have ascertained through the information I have collected in different parts of the country is the identity of the Kara-Aghach River and of the Khor-i-Ziareh, or, as it is called in the Dashti, the Mund River, and I hope to have the opportunity of proving by actual survey the justness of my conjecture. Abbott formerly suggested that it falls into the Persian Gulf between Kenghan and Assalu, and St. John points out “ Bardistan” as the most probable locality; but the right thing was already suggested by Kiepert, in his Map of Western Persia, published in 1851. Since I wrote down these remarks, Captain Durand has shown me the map'which accompanies your report of your'trip to Shiraz. I see thereby that you too consider the “ Kara-Aghach” and the “ Khor Ziareh” or “ Mund” to be the same river. With regard to the names by which the Kara-Aghach River was designated in ancient and medieval times, I have collected, as far as it is possible without a library, all the passages and combined them together. The earliest mention of it occurs in reference to the voyage under taken by the fleet of Alexander the Great from the Indus to the Euphrates, of which two accounts existed in ancient times, one by the Admiral of the fleet Nearchos, the other by the Pilot of the fleet, Onesieritus. In the first, an extract of which is preserved in Arrian’s Indica, the Kara-Aghach River is called (Chap. 38) “ Sitakus.f” In the second, from which Pliny (Nat. His. VI, 26) has borrowed some details, not directly, but second-hand, from a book of King Tuba, the name assumes a slightly different form “ SitiogauusJ.” The difference of the * Note.— They comprise the Korani (Korooni), i.e., Bunrui, the Zanganah, the Ardashiri and Vanda. The former two belong to the Lak tribes, the latter two are Lurs. The Chehar-Bonichah generally join the Kashgai.—F. C. A. t Note.— This and not Silakus is the true reading, T and L. being often confounded in Greek MSS.—F. C. A. JNote. —This is the reading of the best MSS. Some write Sitiogadus and Sitiogagus which is wrong but generally met with in older books.—F. C. A.AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1877-78. 15 names “ Sitakos” and “ Sitioganus” is easily accounted for. It frequently happens that Greek writers, when they come across a foreign name which in its form bears some resemblance to the oblique case of a Greek noun, transform it into a corresponding Greek nominative. In this case Nearchus, no doubt, heard the name pronounced “ Sitakon” or “ Sitakdn,” and this would be in Persian, “ Sitakan,” and he himself, or per haps Arrian, accordingly formed a nominative “Sitakos” In “ Sitio- ganus” the “ us” is a Latin ending. The “ g” instead of “ k” is due to a phonetic change very common in Persian, and can only be looked upon as a difference in pronunciation. The only real difference consists in the “ i” following the “ t,” but here a very simple and easy emendation gives the right form, viz., instead of “ Sitioganos” read “ Sittoganos.” This form with double “ t” will be supported by another combination to be mentioned further on; so that Onesicritus has been a trifle more accurate than Nearchus or Arrian. Pliny, that is, Onesicritus, says that on this river one navigates up to Pasargadae in seven days. This of course is not true. But such a statement is not to be wondered at, when w r e consider how frequent fabulous accounts of the origin and course of rivers are to be found in the history of geography. It only shows that people at the mouth of the river knew that its course was very long, and that it came from somewhere up-country, perhaps not far from the royal cities of Pars. They may also have combined it with the Pulvar. Next comes Ptolemy [2nd cent. P. Chr.], whose knowledge of the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf are evidently based on log-books from the time of the Ptolemean dynasty in Egypt and of the first Roman Emperors. He mentions [Geog. VI, 4] at the place where we would expect the Khor-i-Ziareh, the mouth of the river Brisoana [Brisoana Potamon Enbolai]. Brisoana must be in old Persian “ Berezvan” or “ Berezvana” [Epzend, Berezvant], and signifies “the mighty” [river] j the name being only an apellative, Marcian Heracleensis copies faith fully Ptolemy. I am not a’vVare that any other mention is made of the Kara-Aghach River in Greek writers. But the Arabic geographers know the river quite well, and described its course with great accuracy. It wdll only be necessary to quote IstakhrPs “ Kitab ul Memalik val Mesalik.”* “As to the river ‘ Sakkan/ it issues from the landsf of El- t •• Rustak,” a cultivated place, also RaweyhanJ from a village called “ Shax- border district—E. C. R. ran, the fields or which it waters. Then it flows down to the district§ of § Rustak. Siah, and waters it; thence to Kewar, and waters it; thence to Khabr, and waters it; thence to El-Simakan, * Note. —Ibn-Haukal’s “ Kitab-ul-Mesalik val Meraalik” (Ar. text, edited by De Goeje, Leyden, 1873) is only to be considered as a new edition of Istakbri, with additions and corrections. The passage on the rivers of Ears is almost identical in both—F. C. A. f Note. —I have simply copied the text of De Goeje, without making any corrections. Instead of “ El-Ruweyhan,” 1 read with Edrisi, “ Ruijan,” which is certainly connected with rud, ru in Bunru—Siah now 8iakh—Khabr now Khafr.—F. C. A.1G ADMINISTHATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY and waters it; then to Karzin, and waters it; then to n village named f “Wadi” in original, which also Sakk. And £the name ol this ri voi h means “valley”—E. C. It. is referred to Sakk. Then it falls into the sea. Now there is no river of Fars more fertilizing than this river/’ [ Edit. Be Goeje, Leyden, 1870, jo. 120.] Comp. ibn-Ilaukal, p. 191. “And the road from Shiraz to Jennabch ; from Shiraz to Khan- El-Asad,]; which is on the River El-Sakkan, six farsakhs, and from the Khan to Dasht-i-Arzan Khan, four farsakhs.” [Ibidyp. 130.] These passages leave no doubt as to the identity of the “ Kara-Aghach” and “ Sakk an,” and I have therefore only to add a remark on the name “ Sakkan.” Every one who has read old Arabic MSS. knows that when “ s” is preceded and followed by “ d” “ t” &amp; “ c,” the latter stroke very easily is left out, the copyist not being over anxious to make a stroke more or less, especially as the diacritical points are generally omitted in proper names. Being acquainted with the old name of the river, “ Sitakan” or “ Sittakan,” 1 think it would be one of the easiest emendations to read instead of “ Sakkan” “ Sitakkan” or, as the Teshdid on the “ k ” is quite anomalous, “ Sittakan.” This I believe to be the true form of the name corresponding exactly to the “ Sitto- gan” of Onesicritus, in the MSS. of Istakhri. The “ t” inadvertently was dropped by the copyist, but the Teshdid belonging to it was preserved and transferred to the “k.” For completeness , sake I may mention that Hammer, and following him Ritter (Geography of Asia, VIII, p. 763), identities the Sitto- ganus, for which he reads Sitiogagus with the “ Sitarejan” of the Arabic geographers. But the “ Sitarejau” (Istakhri has “ Shazkan, ’ Ibn-Haukai “ Shadkan,” evidently a better reading) is, as can easily be ascertained by the text of these authors, one of the rivers belonging to the northern parts of Dashtistan.§ * Note— Compare with course of river on sketch map accompanying the Adminis tration Report for 1875-76.

Report on trade of the Persian Gulf for the year 1877. 1. Effects of late war on the trade. —The closing- of the northern trade routes, consequent on the late war, had a noticeable effect on the trade of South Persia and adjoining countries. Imme diately resulted a large increase to the regular trade of the Gulf ports, apart from consignments sent direct from England, by the Suez Canal, to Tabriz and Khorassan. The time occupied in transit between England and Tabriz is about equal by the two routes, and goods were so promptly introduced by the south, that little hardship appears to have been felt, and prices did not attain the high figures expected. Between Bunder-Abbass and Khorassan, and North Persia generally, a large increase of trade took place, chintzes to the value of 1,000,000 Krans having passed by that way to Tabriz. Camel caravans arrived through Seistan, also at Bunder Abbass. 2. Steam communication. —The increased number of steamers ply ing up the Gulf has caused a fall in freights with the result of stimulat ing the export trade. 3. Grain harvest. —The crops in South Persia were plentiful, and the shipments of grain unusually large. The agriculturists are said to be sensibly improved in circumstances, and have this season been able to dis pense with the customary advances for grain deliverable at the harvest time. The yield for the year 1878 is known to be also good, but a prohi bition against exportation is kept on, though largely evaded by those who know how to obtain the favor of the local authorities. 4. Scarcity of coin. —Scarcity of coin of the realm, whether gold, silver, or copper, is becoming a serious impediment to trade transac tions, and threatens to cause a dead-lock if not counteracted. The gold has disappeared, the silver is fast following, and copper is hard to obtain. It is thought that the best remedy would be the opening of a mint at Bushire. 5. Opium. The Persian opium trade continues to grow in importance, and in the year 1877 nearly 5,000 cases were prepared for shipment. The crop of 1878 is said to be still greater, and the limit of development is by no means reached. Some information about the Persian opium and trade may be found in the Report for 1874-75. 6. Pearl fisheries. —The real value of the pearl fisheries has been subject of speculation and inquiry, and from various causes is not easy to determine. Those engaged in the trade have an interest in concealing the extent of their dealings and profits, and this with an article of so little bulk is easy of accomplishment. Returns of the export of pearls from the Persian Gulf and Muscat are collected, but owing to the system of concealment, these require to be checked by comparison with other sources of information. Comparing the returns of exports from the Gulf to India with the imports recorded at the Custom Houses of Calcutta, Bombay, and Kurrachee, it appears that Vide Table No. 31. if for exports and imports of “ trea- Appemlix C. sure” be read “ pearls,” the totals correspond very nearly. As it is known that no specie has been available D26 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY in recent years for export, hence to India this conjecture may not be far amiss. It is to be noted that no other descriptions of precious stones or gems are largely exported from the Gulf. The annual value of the outturn may be put at at least £600,('00 approximately. Captain Durand, 1st Assistant Resident, has drawn up an interesting memorandum on the subject of the pearl fisheries, Appendix A. which will be found in the Appendix. 7. Bate culture. —The introduction of the date palm into India from the Persian Gulf, which was first attempted in 1868, seems to have been attended with success, and may eventually prove important. The measure was originated under the auspices of the Chief Commis sioner in Oude, and subsequently the Conservator of Forests in Mysore and Coorg was supplied with plants. Some shoots have recently been forwarded from Busrah for experiment in Rajpootana, which seems to be a climate well adapted for the growth of the palm. A memorandum on the subject of the ‘culture of the date palm drawn up by Mr. J. C. Edwards, 2nd Assistant Resident, Appendix B. is appended as likely to be of general use and interest. 8. Impediments to development of trade in Persia. —The diffi culties in the way of the foreign merchants trading in South Persia are subject of frequent comment, and their complaints are of both a general and special nature. The absence of system in the adminis tration, the want of sympathy between the governing and subject classes, and other circumstances combine to restrict the development of the resources of the country. Industries are abandoned in despair, lands lie untilled, perhaps because the headmen fear to attract attention to the capabilities of their districts. The pastoral nomads or iliats of the south create insecurity and openly plunder the settled peasantry with impunity. A gentleman happening recently to witness a horde of Arab Ils coolly reaping the grain sown by the villagers of a district, on asking the nomads, was informed that it was God’s will the poor should till the land for the braver class, and that so far from this being robbery they were simply supplying their necessities. “ Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes.” (Sd.) E. C. Ross, Lieut.-Col., Resident, Persian Gulf.AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1877*78. 27 Appendix A to Part II. Notes on the Pearl Fisheries of the Persian Gulf, prepared by Captain E. L. Duband, 1st Assistant Political Resident, Persian Gulf. The origin of the fisheries in the Gulf of Oman is lost in the mists of a pre-historic period when no doubt the beauties of Niniveh and Babylon were wont to deck their hair with gems drawn from the same pregnant shoals that to this day largely supply the markets of the old world. 2. We see from the accounts of travellers and historians that as time went on a high value was set upon the pearls of Oman on account of their peculiar beauty and lustre. Pliny says distinctly “Those are most highly valued which are found in the vicinity of Arabia in the Persian Gulf, ” but here Ids geography is at fault as he goes on “ which forms a part of the lied Sea”. 3. If we are to judge by the number of times that the Islands of Bahrain have been taken and retaken, their importance as the heart of the fisheries has never been undervalued. Even from the time when Tylos* and Arathos were Phoenician colonies. These islands have changed hands more often than the Koh-i-Noor and are now in equally safe-keeping. 4. It is a matter of great difficulty to arrive at anything approach ing to a correct estimate of the amount and value of the pearls that are now yearly harvested, as they are carried to many different markets to suit the varying tastes of the nations. * Some go to the Courts of Europe, whilst others, failing in this “purpose of their high creation,” are reduced into aphrodisiacs that may stimulate the energies of the worn out Sybarites of Hindustan. These latter are however usually small, or at any rate are of no intrinsic value, as it would fall to few to be able to concoct as rare a love potion as the one in which the Egyptian Queen pledged her Imperial Lover. This heirloomf from the Kings of the East was so large that its fellow was deemed worthy to deck the Venus of the Roman Pantheon. Between these best and worst there are many varieties which will be separately noticed hereafter. * The ancient names Tylos is still preserved in the name of a village (against the statement of Rawlinson). Vincent had thrown doubt upon the very derivation of the names which Rawlinson upholds. These islands have been claimed as the birth place itself of the Phoenician race; that they had colonies there is certain. Itrabo, who wrote before A.D. 20, quotes Eratos thenes, (one of Alexander’s Historians) who says that Tyrus and Aradus are occupied by Phoenicians. Uosselin says they first moved from Sidm, or Sidodona, a city visited by March us to people Bahrein, and from thence established themselves on the shores of the Mediterranean. Hureu in 1854 states positively that traces of Phoenician workmanship and buildings have been found, and is himself convinced of Phoenician occupancy, and Rawlinson, in his most critical 2nd essay on Phoenician emigration, in the 7th chapter of Herodotus, gives all the arguments for and against the supposition. A comparison of most of the authors quoted, and the belief of Political Officers now serving in the Gulf, would lead one to the conclusion that there had most certainly been a Phoenician occupa tion though there is only a possibility of these islands having been the cradle of the founders of Tyre and Sidon. Herodotus himself however records his belief and the grounds of it. f It was supposed to be worth 10 million Sesterces.28 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OE THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY 5. The peace of the Gulf is now assured under British protectorate, and the fisheries are regularly worked by the maritime tribes of Fars and Oman. They are emphatically “ free to all” and afford sustenance throughout the year to at least 35,000 heads of families, who are thus kept healthily employed, and reclaimed from the old courses of plunder and piracy, occupations towards which the untutored Arab mind has most deter mined proclivities. But the term “ free to all ” is used in the sense of free to all the inhabitants of the coast, and the policy of Government is to discourage interference from outside. There have been indeed two endeavours made of late years by European British subjects to woo fortune by organizing an expedition in a more thorough and wholesale manuer than it would be in the power of the Arab divers to attempt. The wishes of Government, however, once made clear, no persistence was offered, and no doubt it would be unsafe for any foreign boats to carry on diving operations without the protection of our vessels. The Turks atone may be looked to as a possible but not probable cause of unpleasantness in the future. 6. In consequence then of this valid protectorate, the fisheries are carried on most peaceably by the various tribes, under the acknowledged authority of Government, and in cases of difficulty or the clash of interests, those concerned would always (failing an understanding between their Chiefs) refer the matter in dispute to the friendly arbitration of the British Resident, whose decision is final. There are many advantages derived from the state of affairs above sketched. The Persian Gulf is now free from the pirates that used to f infest it, and trade is carried on by our own subjects in all safety. The Chiefs of the coast are enriched by the trade that is brought to their capitals and advantaged by the state of general security and immunity from dread of attack and plunder. The general population is as I think has been shown above largely benefited. Besides these indirect advantages (if the term is applicable), the Sheikhs retain a few in the matter of the fisheries themselves, par taking of the nature of taxes, the yearly income derived from which, being a gain of a more obvious character, would necessarily be far more appreciated. 7. I allude to the impositions of 'Nob” and “ Traz ” levied on the boats engaged in the fisheries. The 'Nob” was a tax originally imposed by the Chief of Bahrein about the Mahomedan year 1216 (say eighty years ago) to enable him to equip war vessels for the protection of his own fishing smacks, and the banks generally. For this purpose four decently armed vessels were on perpetual duty, and they levied one share on the result of the fishing of every boat that cast anchor on the banks. If the boats preferred to compound, a money payment of three rupees was taken, which sum was afterwards raised to four rupees, at which amount it stood when the British Government became responsible for the security of the Gulf. iAND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1877-78. 29 It is almost unnecessary to add that the ' r tax was continued under the altered circumstances, and that it is a source of considerable profit to the rulers, being now levied however when the boats fit out and leave for the fisheries. If the “Nakhoda” or master of the smack has not the money to * Or, a? written in Arabic, “Musa- pay before starting, he gives an order kam, ” a word of unknown derivation. oil his Buillieah or “ MusaygUm*/ , who pays the amount and recovers afterwards from the proceeds of the fishing, but I shall have occasion to recur again to this gentleman’s manner of doing business. 8. This custom of levying “Nob” commended itself at once to the unanimous appreciation of the Sheikhs of the Arab littoral, and it is in full force from Has Mussendom to Koweit. The proceeds derived from the tax at Bahrein and Guttur in 1872, were supposed to amount to Rupees 3 0,000. Whilst on the Arab Coast from Abu-Zhabi to Khassah the yield was put down at Rupees 20,000. In explanation of this difference I should mention that the heads of the different tribes at Bahrein (as well as those on the Coast of Oman) have the right to send out from 10 to 15 boats, duty free, according to their rank and the number of their followers. 9. The “ Traz ” is a further tax, levied exclusively on the Arab littoral, and is one “ Sebs’f” share, which being deducted from the pearls brought in by each boat, is made over to the Chief. The amount would thus of course vary according to the amount of the take of each boat’s crew, it would be somewhere between four and one hundred Rupees; as a rule, not more than the latter sum, but this uncertainty makes any estimate of the yearly revenue derived by the maritime Sheikhs under this head an impossibility. We may, however, fairly assume that the item is considerable. Classes of men engaged in the Pearl Trade of the Gulf. 10. It has been noticed above that these fisheries are open to all the inhabitants of the coasts of the Gulf and Oman, but it must not be supposed for a moment that the trade is really in their hands. It is the old story sic vos non vobis. They merely stand in the relation of “ hewers of wood and drawers of water” to the “ Musaygum,” the supplier. This is no other than our ubiquitous friend the Indian Bunneah, whom we find equally at home here as in the wilds of the northern ranges beyond the Indus, and carrying on a thriving trade with far less risk to himself of personal annoyance. This immunity is here due to the protection he receives as a British subject, whilst there, an unnecessarily importunate creditors’ account is wiped out in a manner characteristic of, and no doubt suiting to, the requirements of the country. f For value of shares and division sec below.30 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Here' truly he is in good circumstances, regaled on the famed Arab sweetmeats of Muscat, he makes hay “whilst the sun shines,” and^robs his dependents most amicably. Thisjie’does, firstly, in the matter of the advances, and afterwards in the manner of valuing and paying for the outcome of the labour of the crews, and if he does indeed sometimes fall upon an evil day, when the village he may chance to inhabit is sacked by the Bedouin, he claims damages and invariably, ultimately, receives them though his soul may be harrowed by the dilatory action of the Arab whose objections to disgorge his prey are strongly rooted. The “ Musaygum” is however nevertheless a necessity at present, for the reckless Arabs spend what they can get, and then look to him to keep them supplied with food and raiment for the rest of the year. They keep no accounts, neither give nor take bonds or agreements; and the entries in the Bunneahs’ books (if any dispute arises) are taken as evidence of the correctness of each item of supply, or other transaction. When I say “ taken as evidence, I mean it to the fullest extent; as in disputed cases the Chief orders a Marine Court to assemble to try the case. This Court may consist of one or more old men, well versed in the trade, who go by the name of “ Salifeh-ul-ghous”. This is not a permanent appointment, the Court being convened when required and the Salifeh nominated by the Chief. To resume—the Bunneah supplies the Nakhoda or headmen of the boat with every necessary of clothes, food, tobacco, &amp;c., required for his trip, a list of which of course goes down in his ledger at his own valuation. On return from the fisheries the Nakhoda makes over his whole packet of pearls to be valued in the gross, and on this being completed, the Bunneah takes over the lot at 20 per cent, below the appraisement. Every merchant knows the market value of pearls for the year, so that this transaction is easily effected. Now however the “ Musaygum” has to pay the 80 per cent, of the value of the pearls, but he is constitutionally averse to parting with more cash than can be decently avoided. He therefore totals up the account of the advances and deducts this amount; further he supplies as much of the balance as he can, in goods and stores, which the Nakhoda has to take. On this the computed gain is from 20 to 35 per cent. What the crew will not take off his hands, is sold by the Nakhoda for what it will fetch in the bazaar; and this is added to the small sum of ready money which has been paid by the Musaygum. The whole is then divided according to the recognized share of each member of the crew. A further protection enjoyed by the Musaygum against the chance of losing by a run of bad luck in the fishery should be noticed. He is free to dissolve his connection with the Nakhoda he employs, and supplies, whenever he finds it convenient. By this system, if the Nakhoda is unable to settle his account, they go before the “ Salifeh-ul-ghous,” and a decree is given by which the Nakhoda hasAND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOlt THE YEAH 1877-78. 31 to pay off his debts by yearly instalments. A paper of release (from obligations) is supplied by the Musaygum, and the Nakhoda seeks another employer. This new master sees the amount of yearly instalment due, and is liable himself for it for the year that he receives the Nakhoda into his service. In turn he also is similarly protected, but the whole instalments due to the first master must be paid up before the second master can claim those which have been assessed as his due. Of course, the whole boat's crew is more or less in debt to the Nakhoda as he himself is to the Bunneah, so that when it suits the latter to sell up a Nakhooda rather than await payment of the debt by instalments, he does so to the extent of the boat and the crew. Here however his claims are ended, and from that moment the Nakhoda is a free man, his house and other property on shore cannot be touched, and he is able to enter into new contracts elsewhere. This he generally does, getting together a fresh crew, and hiring a boat at the recognised rate of 20 per cent, on the value of the season's harvest. One further prohibitory custom that obtains iu the Guff should be mentioned, it is this, that should a stranger buy pearls privately from a Nakhoda, without the permission of his Musaygum, he becomes responsible for all the Nakhoda's debts even if these are far in excess of the value of the pearls which have changed hands. Altogether, looking at the position of the Bunneah in the Persian Gulf, it would seem to be rather an enviable one according to their ideas. They are well protected, and have every opportunity of amassing considerable wealth. 11. It* will be noticed below that the crew of the boats engaged in these fisheries have all a recognized * See para. 12. definite share in the results of their enterprise. The Nakhoda is the master, the responsible man, and often owns the boat himself. The Seb or saib, the hauler, comes next, and lastly the “ ghoas' or diver; besides these working hands there are usually a boy or two employed to catch fish for the daily food, (which is done by putting down traps at night, shaped like an English Eel trap) to cook, and for other purposes. The Nakhoda is either “ khali” (i.e., free from debt), the actual owner of the boat, and rich enough to conduct operations and provision his boat and crew without having recourse to a “ Musaygum,' or he owns the boat, but has not money enough to do this, or, lastly, he has merely hired the boat at the usual rate of 20 per cent, on the value of the season's gains. In either of these latter cases he is emphatically no longer free as he falls into the hands of the Musaygum. Once in that gentleman's books it is not easy to make hauls large enough to get out of them again, or do more than gain a bare subsistence.32 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN OULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The crew of course is as entirely in the Nakhoda's books as lie himself is in those of the Bunneah. 12. The shares of each of the above are as follows :— If the boat is hired and does not belong to the Nakhoda, this one- fifth goes to the owner, and the Nakhoda has to be content with one “ ghoas” share. 13. We see therefore that there are the two taxes of Nob and Traz, which have to be met from the proceeds of the fishing; that the “Musaygum” or “Nakhodas” account has to be settled; that the value of the take is reduced 20 per cent, in favor of the Musaygum ; that one-fifth of the remainder goes to the owner of the boat, whoever he may be, and finally that what remains after all these charges have been met is divided into five shares, of which three-fifths go to the divers for division amongst themselves and two-fifths to the haulers. As the haulers and divers are always in equal numbers, the share of the diver is somewhat the larger, and this is fair as his work is infinitely the harder. 14. The “ Seb,” are usually Bedouins, sometimes Persians ; it is their duty to work the ship, handle oars and sail, and pull up the divers. 15. The “ Ghoas” is generally a Sedee, or Arab of the poorer classes, or a sedee domestic slave. He will go on diving all day if the weather is fair, merely taking short rests in the water, to recover breath and strength. As a rule he does not remain below longer than 50 to 70 seconds. The latter is over the average; these men are very abstemious, eating about a £ lb of dates in the morning, and drinking three or four cups of coffee after morning prayers; and they then begin fishing when the sun gets up. At about 2 o’clock they all come out of the water for coffee, prayers, and a rest which lasts for about an hour, when they go to work again till sundown. At night they eat a hearty meal of roast fish and dates, and do no further work. A good diver will go down twelve, fourteen, and even sixteen fathoms occasionally, but this last depth is so great a strain that very few are capable of enduring it. From eight to twelve fathom is the usual depth at which work is carried on. 16. There are many different weights in the boat to suit the necessity of each diver who chooses a sinking stone that will neither be too light nor too heavy for his comfort. These weights are attached to his feet, slipped, and hauled up again when he reaches the bottom. A pair of horn pincers on his nostrils, a rope round his waist, and leather tips to his fingers, to save his hands from abrasions, usually complete his costume. 17. In the case of a large number of devil fish being about his toilette is more finished, it then consists of a long white shirt to protect 'Nakhoda” ... one-fifth.

They have no fear of sharks or dog fish; accidents of this sort are said to be unknown. On reaching the bottom the diver holds on wdth one hand and one foot, propelling himself with the other, and making use of his disengaged hand to gather the shells and put them in the small sacking bag that hangs round his neck. Sometimes he is floated away by a current, and on these occasions the exertion is severely felt, and he comes up exhausted. As a rule, however numerous the shells may be, a man cannot gather more than fifteen or sixteen per dive. 18. That this incessant plunging entails a severe physical strain will be obvious, and indeed the divers are liable to sundry ailments, of which the worst are madness, cramps, and paralysis, the latter being sometimes a merely temporary form of the disease. A lesser ailment, but one that is constantly suffered from, is a softening and rotting of the skin; to guard against this the divers constantly rub in “ japt” or tanning, when turning in for the night. A few common drugs are always kept in the boat, the favourite being senna, which is mixed up with raisins and tamarind, but burning with hot iron is the mode of cure most frequently attempted when the illness looks serious. 19. Altogether it would appear that the diver has rather a hard time of it, but he is buoyed up by hopes of reward for extra exertions and windfalls (if such a term is applicable under the circumstances). Of the nature of this latter is the “ Tabreh,” which is the best piece of luck that can befall him. This ec para. 3 . entitles him to a new suit of clothes from the Nakhoda and a present for the crew. Another form of good fortune is that in which a pearl is found outside the shell, or attached to it; in either case, as also in the event of a shell containing an unformed pearl, it is the property of the diver and crew, and no deduction of 20 per cent, is allowed to the Musaygum on the market value of the find. It is customary also to make him a small present if he finds a good pearl during the opening of the shells, which operation takes place every morning regularly, after prayers are over, and before the diving begins. The crew sit round the heap gathered during the previous day and set to work on them with crooked knives. When all have been opened, and the pearls extracted have been examined, they are given into the Nakhoda's keeping, who weighs and records all particulars every fifth day. 20. It follows from the dependent position of all the minor agents engaged in this business, that, from the impecunious Nakhoda down to the boat boys, all are more or less tied and bound by local usage and customs from which they cannot shake free. The Nakhoda is bound to the Musaygum, and the crew to the Nakhoda in like manner, on account of the advances of food, &amp;c.,—u 34- ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY which all have received, so that in the case of one of them levanting and throwing in his lot with another master, should he be recognized, he is immediately recaptured, “ Arte vel. marte,” and failing this, redress is sought by an appeal to the Chiefs. As a rule, however, there is very little quarrelling, and boats even of tribes at enmity with each other will often pursue their business within a few cables length of each other without disturbance. 21. There is usually one chief boat in a fleet to which the others from the same port or district look for guidance, and when this one hoists the flag of departure, the lesser fry generally follow suit. 22. There is a certain amount of entertaining among the Nakhodas, who visit each other's ships of an evening to discuss coffee, # pi)cs wafer cakes, and “kullians,*” as well as to compare notes on their mutual successes or failure. Seasons. 23. There are three different seasons in which fishing is carried on. r lhe first is the “Ghusul Bard,' which opens in the spring when deep sea fishing is not attempted, and lasts for about 40 days, beginning about the 15th April. The divers have to relieve each other every half hour or so, on account ol the cold, and the share of the proceeds of this fishery is equally* divided between the divers and the “ haulers,' as these are sup posed to have to work more than during the summer fishing. 24. The second is the fishing season the Ghusul-i- Kabir, which begins when the blustering “shimals'of June are over, and lasts all through the great heats till the end of September. 25. The third is the cold weather fishing “ Mojennah,' which is conducted principally by wading the shallows along the coast. The boats are armed to repel the attacks of the Bedouins, which are not infrequent, but altogther this season's fishing produces small profits, the pearls being for the most part small and discoloured, but not as a rule malformed. Such then are the seasons for the regular Gulf fisheries, but large boats often go from the Arab Coast and fish at Socotra, returning home sometimes only after a lapse of two years, and having visited Aden, Moculla, &amp;c. These boats insure themselves against losses from bad luck in pearl fishing, by taking the shell of the Zinni Mussel, on which they make considerable profit. Hair or Pearl Banks. 26. Phe pearl oyster is found in all the waters from Has Mus- sendom to the head of the Gulf, but there are now no famed banks on the Persian side, although mention is still made of some minor ones. Old writers allude to several which were well known on those shores, and I # In contradistinction to the shares of 3 to 2.AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1877-78. 35 have seen some samples of small and yellow, but very brilliant, pearls which were gathered at the island of K arrack close to Bushire. The banks which are mostly fished are those that lie between the 24th and 27th degrees of North Latitude and the 50th and 55th degrees of East Longitude in the shoal waters of the Arab Coast. It is almost unnecessary to specify any particular localities, as the whole of the shallows are more or less fertile, and the fishing ground seem to be liable to continual change, but the banks of Dehee, Shiltaye, Gumreh and Arfaj are famous. 27. With regard to this characteristic of a constant shifting of the fish, instance may be made of the harvest of 1876, when nearly every boat in the Gulf was riding in the vicinity of the Shah* Alum shoal, which is situated almost in the middle of the Gulf, boasts a very small circumference, and is surrounded by deeps of 30 and 40 fathom where no diver could ply his trade. Here the haul was very large, it was in fact a “bumper” year, but when the boats came down on it next year in full anticipation of another rich harvest, there was comparatively nothing forthcoming. 28. Broadly however it is safef to say that the boats collect prin cipally between Sir-beui Yas island and Shiltaye, where lie the best known and most fished banks, and where a smaller or greater yield is a certainty. This enormous extent of ocean is almost all of it shallow enough to be at the mercy of the Arab diver. The hanks vary in distance from the shore from one to ninety miles, but the deep sea banks are not so much fished till the “ Skemal” or Nor- westers of June have spent their force. 29. These gales, very sudden, severe, and of certain yearly recur rence, are much dreaded by the Arab sailors, whose boats indeed seem scarcely fitted to weather a hurricane peculiarly buoyant as they are, the slightest gust at an unexpected moment will send the gunwale down a Jhur del’eau. Eair weather is the more an essential to their system of navigation, as they use no charts, compasses, &amp;c.; they are guided by bearings from the land, by the sun, and the colour of the water by day, the stars and the moon by night, but their local know ledge of the sea bed is said to be very thorough. Fertility. 30. With regard to the fertility of the banks the weight of evidence would seem to be in favour of the supposition that the yield has decreased of late years. # Longitude 52° 30'.

That is krailS.f We must however not lose As to this asserted diminution of the yield becoming more marked I should be very sceptical. There would be nothing to account for anything of the sort (other than a natural temporary deficit) in the manner that the fisheries have been carried on of late years. I have failed to obtain mention or even tradition of any failure in this marine harvest, and indeed the fish has here everything in its favour. In the first place, there is the climate, the usually quiet weather, and sea, the hundreds of miles of shoal water, warmed through and through by that dead heat, which, as the Arabs themselves say, makes the fish jump out of “the water to get cool.” Then the cooler deeps as a perpetual preserve; for the boldest “ Sedee” diver will not fish J as a rule beyond twelve fathom, and there is not one man in twenty who can go down sixteen, and lastly the temper, or continence, of the divers themselves. They are too wise to kill the goose with golden eggs, and say “ that will do for another year” when they come upon a small lot of shells.

With regard to the greater or less fertility of banks, this is supposed to depend on the depth of the water, but the Arabs do not seem to attach much more importance to one locality than to another. They say that they find considerably more shells in shallow than in deep water, though these are generally smaller, also that the oysters are not as a rule larger on new banks than on the old ones. * Lately the value of pearls has fallen in the Indian market. The fall has been going on for three years, and it is actually cheaper to buy in India than at Bahrein. The trade however is in fact a monopoly which may account for this.

Pearl-bearing oysters are here divided into three classes, called “Zinni,” Sudait'ee, and Mabar, respectively; of these the Mahar contains the best pearls, and is found in deeper water than the others. The Sudaifee comes next, which is a longer shell than the Mahar, does not produce such a white or heavy pearl, but one that is said to improve by keeping. The neighbourhood of Ras-el-Jubal is famed for these. The Zinni are the least esteemed, the pearl is said to be lighter and liable to spoil by a change of colour, an accident from which the Mahar is said to be free, but the Zinni shell has come into great demand during the last three years, in consequence of a rage for pearl ornaments in Europe, and large fortunes have been lately made; three years ago you could buy 100 maunds of 91b. the maund for 10 dollars at most. Now 100 maunds cost 60 dollars. This mussel must however not be confounded with the large raother-o’-pearl shell which is really more valuable from its greater size. 33. The manner in which the oyster (or mollusk more properly) anchors himself, slips his cable, &amp;c.,* is so well known that a descrip tion would be superfluous. The divers assert that these cables are some times of fabulous length, goingthrough the banks and re-appearing again in a manner that would preclude all chance of following one up. 34. They say also that the oysters are invariably found open- mouthed, but on the “scent” of the hand approaching them they close up. 35. Occasionally the diver comes upon a packed mass of oysters which is called a “ Tabreh;” these clinging round and growing out from each other may occupy a small space, but are invariably pearl-bearing, and such a find will often make up for months of disappointments. Such a lucky accident is not of very common occurrence. This form of swarming was evidently known to Pliny, who quotes other writers, setting forth a statement that the oysters lived in com munities like bees under a chief of large size and venerable old age or beauty, who took precautions against danger.

In vain Sir R.

They contend moreover that there are four distinct kinds of pearls, viz :— (i.) Pearls from the Gulf # The mnuher cannot be vouched for, but the facts of the pearl being built in layers is well substantiated, and a pearl with one or two damaged layers can be cleaned down to the lower and more perfect stratum. t Fishing grounds still visited by the Arab. t This would seem to be a prejudiced statement. of Oman recognisable by their peculiar gloss and purity and possessing seven* coats which are very thin and lustrous. (ii.) Pearls from Socotra and the Red Sea.f These are not considered to be of so good a colour, shape, or brilliance, and have only five coats. (iii.) Pearls from Ceylonj: not so pure as the last, and are only allowed three coats! (iv.) Pearls from Kurrachee ; these are the worst, have only one skin, and are formed round a nucleus of sand. They are very lightly esteemed. However this may be with regard to the pearl in general, it is very certain that the pearls of Oman themselves vary in weight, colour, shape, and lustre, so much so indeed that the merchants recognize six different names for different sorts of pearls, besides the three distinct colouis, white, red, and blue. Black pearls are also sometimes found; they are considered to be of no value, and are called “ dead” pearls, though found in living shell fish. 38. These well-recognized distinctions are tabulated in the margin. The first being the Yekah {i.e.y unique) or Suffeid-i- shirin, which, like all pearls large enough to be valued singly or in small packets, takes rank according to its size, purity, and beauty of form. They are all sold after a certain size, at so much per chao, but this will be more fully gone into presently. If such a pearl were found weighing one miscal or six grains English, being good and pure and shapely, its value in the present state of the market would be chao. White Pear It. 1.

Besides those tabulated, there are two other denominations constantlv used. These are the Toulief, ranking between the Maghz and Kambayiti, and the Bookeh, a white but soft pearl, of no great value, which finds its way to the Baghdad and Syrian markets. A considerable trade is done in these smaller and less individually valuable pearls. A merchant gave out yesterday (as an instance) that be had been commissioned to buy small pearls to the amount of ten thousand krans by a Persian Noble, who wanted them to sew on to his horse trappings. 39. The merchants in the Gulf know at once to what “ family” the sample pearls put before them belong, and this indeed so accurately that a good merchant will assert his ability to tell you, not only from what depth of water any particular specimen has come, but also the very name of the bank in the Gulf which has been its birth-place. The possession by any one of so very nice a discriminating power must be pioblematical, but it is an undoubted fact that the pearls drawn from shallow water are, as a rule, of lower specific gravity, of less purity, and more uncertain form than those gathered in the deeps. This was very well known to be the case in old times. Pliny notices the effect of the sun in his account of pearl formation, and the Arabs hold precisely the same opinions as those put forward by him to this day. They say that all the purest, largest, and best pearls come from the deeps, whilst the shallows, though far more pregnant, yield a lio*hter pearl, and invariably with a stain of colour which depreciates its value. Where the sun can reach, colour is invariably found in a greater or less degree. There is further a strongly-rooted idea that pearls found between the mainland and adjacent island are distorted, whilst in the quiet deep seas the pearls become round and heavy. 40. The different classes of pearls have been mentioned above, and the marginal tables will give some idea of the ordinary market price at present obtaining for the best picked pearls. The price of pearls is said to have doubled in the last 25 years. Most of the purchases are made by weighment, having regard to the shape and brilliancy of the particular specimen, the price of a really large perfect pearl may be almost anything, but these are very rare and are dealt with separately. 41. For the more ordinary trade, the merchants have 24 sieves These I have most carefully measured carefully bored to a certain size and three or four times over, and have drawn the average value of ffood samples to actual scale by 100 parts of an inch. ^ . ampies See table A attached to paragraph 40. I 1 ft through each Sieve IS fairly ascertainable.40 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY Four of these in most ordinary use have special names, the “ Has” or head, the “ Batan” or stomach, the “ Dzel ” or tail, and the “Tir-i-Dzel” or under the tail. These are shown in the table. They are bought at so much per“chao” down to a certain size from the divers, when they are then sold en masse at so much per “miscal.” There are 330 chao in a miscal,* and the Arab chao is equal to four Hindustani chaos. The best weights are shaped in agate, which is not so liable to alter as are those made of metal. The usual form of sale is by packets, and pearls of a particular size being chosen out, the value of the rest of the packet will be depreciated. A merchant would therefore insist upon a higher price of pearls so chosen; in fact for picked and single pearls the purchaser must be content to pay a fancy price. There are such a number of con siderations that influence the sale of pearls that anything more than an approximation to the market value cannot be given, and this changes yearly. 42. In the last 25 years the price of pearls, as has been above said, The increased value of a “chao” by has increased 50 per cent.

In fact the conclusion I arrive at is that pearl-dealing cannot be reduced to an exact science. 43. The last point that must be touched upon is that of the yearly export and its value, and here we are terribly at fault—partly from the impossibility of obtaining correct returns from the various rulers and the Custom Houses, and partly from the fact that a Native merchant's con science is not very tender in such a small matter as the declaration of the value of his merchandize when taking out a bill of lading for present ation in India. In point of fact, it is well known that pearls are under valued as a matter of course. Colonel Pelly put down the total export in 1865 at £400,000, or say 40 lakhs, and this has been since accepted as an approximately correct figure. In 1856 a report was published on the navigation of the Gulf by . Captain Brucks in which the export of Bombay Records, XXIV of 1856. pearls from Bahrein alone, in 1S24, as stated by the Company's broker and the Shaikh’s Vizier, was put down at 1,600,000 German Crowns or Rupees 32,00,000, or £320,000, of course the values Irave changed since then, but for comparison these fimires will do.

Appendix B to Part II. Memorandum on the system of cultivating the date palm in the vicinity of Bushire, with some information connected with its growth, produce, price, fyc., fyc., hy Mr. J. C. Edwards, %nd Assistant Resident. Offshoots which sprout around the foot of the female tree are procured from Busreh, Kateef or Bahrein, and transplanted to wherever the cultivator may desire to have a date grove. These offshoots may be procured of all sizes, hut the smaller ones—say one foot high—are preferred, as the chances of injury from transplanting are less than to those of a larger size. After being transplanted they require to be watered daily for two or three years. The soil in which they are planted should be soft, and the base of the plant surrounded with manure. The manure used in these parts 'for this purpose is horse-dung mixed with earth, and allow’ed to decompose for a year before being used. Where water is very plentiful these offshoots are known to have sprung up rapidly and borne fruit within four or five years. But where water is scarce, and the soil hard, ten or twelve years elapse before any^ signs of fruit are visible. Opinions differ in regard to the rearing of date trees from seed. Some aver that the trees thus reared never come to perfection; others that theytdo and bear fruit, but are generally weak and never satisfactory. It has also been suggested that if the date seed be planted with the fruit it would germinate sooner and thrive better than if the seed were sown alone. But all agree that offshoots are the best, inasmuch as they take less time to grow, and are by far more strong and productive than the trees reared from seed. These offshoots “ are extremely hardy, and may remain for eight or ten weeks exposed without injury. Their average weight is about six pounds.” The date tree first shows its blossom in February; these sprout around the heart of the tree in strong covers very much resembling sword scabbards in shape. They split about March and show a bunch of blossoms milky white in colour. The cultivator has now to decide what number of bunches he should leave on the tree, and withdraws the superabundance. The number of bunch blossoms on each tree varies from 12 to 24, but it is seldom that more than 12 are allowed to remain for fruit. At this period also the cultivator has to impregnate the blossoms of the female tree hy joining thereto some portion of the blossom of the male tree. This is done by simply depositing a sprig or two from the male into a bunch of the female blossom and lightly binding it up with a sprio-. The male tree is distinguishable by its blossom, which is of a reddish tinge, while that of the female is milky white. The blossom of the male tree is only used for impregnating, and does not turn into fruit. It is averred that in places where the date palm grows thick together, the wind scatters the pollen of the male blossom, and that the female trees thus become impregnated with it, saving the cultivator further trouble on this head.41 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY When through neglect or oversight the female tree fails to be impregnated, it is asserted that the fruit it bears does not come to perfec tion, is seedless and insipid. The blossom of the date tree is known in Persian by the name of Taralt ( ), the process of impregnating Budadan ( ), the male tree Nar ( ), the female Madah ( ). About May the fruit begins to form, and from this time to Septem ber, when the fruit is perfectly ripe, the tree sheds the superabundance, which is used as food by the proprietor or those he employs to watch his property. At this period the fruit is known as Khumal ( JUA ), and is green in color. In June and July the fruit is known as Kharek ( and is either red or yellow in color. It is now fit to be eaten, and where marts are close, such quantities as are saleable are cut down for the purpose. In August the date becomes soft and juicy; it is known as Ratab ( k-*.!) ), and sold in the bazaars as food, but is not yet in a fit state for preservation, as if kept for two or three da)s it would turn sour. In September the date is known as Khurma(L r A). It is now in a fit state for preservation. After being taken off the tree it is gathered into a tank or trough and exposed to the air and sun, where it throws oif its extra juice and sufficiently hardens to allow of its being packed up in baskets and prepared for exportation. The juice is gathered and stowed in skins or jars; it is called Dushab ( ), and is used by the poorer classes in lieu of sugar. This juice is also used in preserving dates in jars, this is done by mixing these with sesame seed, ginger powder, and the kernels of walnuts. This preserve is called Khurma-Shirah ( ), and is much prized both for use in the Persian Gulf and for exportation. There is a species of date called Kharak Bereymi ( ) which does not ripen beyond the Kharak stage. The mode of preserving this has been to boil it well in water, and then to expose it to the sun and air till hardened. If well packed and preserved from damp, this will keep for sometime, but if kept in air-tight tins, might keep for an indefinite period in a dry climate, this is called Kharek-i-pukhtah ( ). Another species, the Zahidi ( ), does notripen beyond the Ratab stage. In fact, it ceases to progress between the Kharak and Ratab, and is left to remain on the tree till hardened by the sun and atmosphere. It is then cut down and packed in baskets. This species is not much used for food, as it finds a more profitable mart in India, where it is much sought after by distillers of arrack. There are more than a hundred varieties of date known by different names which it would not be easy to enumerate or describe, nor would there be much utility in doing so, for they would only he understood by the natives of these parts, to whom it is a matter of great consequence,AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1877-78. 45 to know the name of the date they purchase, as prices are invariably regulated thereby. As an example, I marginally enu merate the species of dates received as samples from the Chief of Dashtee, which may be said to comprise about all the varieties found in this plain,but in Bahrein, Kuteef, El Hassa, and Busreh there are a great many more kinds, all distinguishable by sepa rate appellations. Prices of dates vary in the ratio of 1 to 4. The best description comes from El Hassa known as Khelas ( These are packed in skins of 70 to 120 lbs., and this year may be priced at the average rate of 15 krans per 124 lbs. The next in quality is the ) Kharek-pukhtah from Busreh, valued at about 12 krans per 124 lbs. -The Hallow from Busreh claims attention next, and is seldom sufficient for from 6 to 7 krans per Imskct of about HO Ibt V “ lu ® The Zahidi j s a i„ mt t | )e same ice as t]le j la ]| ow and is procurable at Busreh. ^ * The Samerun , from Busreh, is very common, and commands between 4 and 5 kraus per basket of 140 lbs.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, POR THE YEAR 1877-78. Political .—The official year 1877-78 commenced with disquieting rumours of a projected rising of the Sharkiyeh tribes against His Highness Seyyid Toorkee's authority, but as both Seyyid Abdul Azeez and Ibrahim were disinclined to take the responsibility of joining the movement unless with good prospects of success, the scheme fell through; the disaffection, however, continued as it was, unremittingly fostered by the Metowwas, and it had soon gathered sufficient strength and consistency for Saleh to be able to throw off the mask of friendship and allegiance to His Highness and announce his hostility by requesting His Highness to discontinue the allowance made him. Being impressed with the necessity of conciliating Sheikh Saleh and of separating him, if possible, from the rest of the faction, His Highness sent him privately a considerable present of money by a confidential servant with the view of regaining his adherence and inducing him to use his endeavouis to dissolve the coalition. The present was accepted by Sheikh Saleh, who dissimulated with His Highness for the time and soon announced that he had succeeded in frustrating the movement. He also made this the basis of a claim for his allowance to be increased by one-half, which was acceded to. The result of Seyyid Toorkee's diplomatic arrangements was that the month of May passed quietly, the only occurrence being a collision in the Semail valley between the Ghaflirees and Hinawis, which was prevented from spreading further by a truce for six months being mediated by the Vizier Seyyid Said who had been despatched thither by His Highness for the purpose. On the 9th June His Highness Seyyid Toorkee and the Acting Political Agent, Mr. Robertson, received letters from Sheikh Saleh bin Ali giving notice of his intention to march on Muscat, and on the 14th Saleh and his followers, whose number was estimated at 1,500, arrived and occupied Muttrah without opposition. Up to the receipt of Saleh’s communication on the 9th no rumours had reached Muscat of the pro jected rising, and the announcement had therefore found Ilis Highness quite unprepared. The only part of the garrison on which reliance could be placed at this time w r as a party of 150 \\ ahabees and a few Belooch soldiers. H. M.’s S. Teazer had on the 8th instant proceeded on a cruize, but fortunately returned to Muscat on the 15th, the day after the occupation of Muttrah. It soon appeared that Seyyid Abdool Azeez was not at the head of the rebellion as had been reported. He had met Saleh bin Ali at Mansah, but having been unaole to agree to Ids terms, had returned to Semed. Saleh then made overtures to Seyyid Ibrahim bin Kais wdio arrived at Muttrah on the 17th. All practicable precautionshaving been taken for the lives and property of British subjects, the Acting Political Agent determined to accord to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee the armed assistance he had formally applied for, and after due warning had been sent to the leader of the rebels, Seyyid Ibrahim, a few shots128 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY were fired by H. M/s S. Teazer at Muscat and Muttrah with a view to dislodge the enemy from their positions and discourage their attack on the town. These measures had the desired effect, and dissen sions having broken out the coalition soon showed signs of collapse. Sheikh Saleh endeavoured to conceal his discomfiture by an insolent demand for $20,000 and the restoration of his own and Seyyid Ibrahim’s allowance, but by the advice of the Acting Political Agent these were promptly rejected, and by the 21st the rebels had entirely dispersed and disappeared from before the town, not, however, before they had plundered and burnt everything within their reach and wantonly murdered several women and helpless Seedees. The loss to llritish subjects at their hands was estimated at $15,173. After the retirement from Muscat Sheikh Hamood of the A1 Wahibeh who had furnished a large part of the rebel force seized upon the date groves at Bosher and threatened to destroy them unless the sum of $2,500 was paid to him by TIis Highness. This demand it was deemed advisable to comply with. Sheikh Saleh on his return to El Sharkiyeh was indefatigable in his exertions to organize a second coalition, but his efforts met with no success. In July the Acting Political Agent proceeded to Soor in H. M/s S. Teazer and succeeded without difficulty in obtaining reparation to the extent of $3,600 from the Jenebeh tribe for the plunder of a banian at that town two years before. In August Sheikh Hamed bin Abdulla of the Beni Ruweyheh tribe, a virulent enemy of Seyyid Toprkee, was murdered at Semed by Salim bin Hilal A1 Bu Saidi in pursuance of a blood-feud. In September Seyyid Abdool Azeez left Semed where he had resided since the rupture with his brother, and proceeded to dwell with the Beni Bu Hassan tribe at Jallaan. Disquieting rumours prevailed of his intentions against Muscat, but nothing resulted, as his efforts to obtain support from the tribes failed, and fears of further disturbances gradually subsided. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Colonel Ross, arrived at Muscat in November on his way to Bushire. In November the Governor of Sohar, Seyyid Bedr bin Seif, His Highness’ stanch friend and supporter, having been induced to visit Muscat, was imprisoned in Fort Marani on a charge of oppressing the inhabitants, and His Highness’ eldest son Mahomed was sent to replace him with Seyyid Ahmed bin Hamad as AVali. Seyyid Bedr was subsequently sent to Zanzibar. Seyyid Abdool Azeez has continued to reside in Jalaan ; further negotiations carried on with a view to his retiring to India on a pension have resulted in failure, as Abdool Azeez has declined to quit Oman on any terms. He has since resumed his intrigues with Sheikh Saleh and the Sharkiyeh tribes to organize a fresh expedition against Muscat, but the tribes have shown no alacrity as yet in responding to his views, and the country generally continues to enjoy tranquillity. Official changes .—In June the Political Agent, Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, proceeded to Europe on six months’ furlough, and was succeeded by Mr. P. J. Robertson, Her Majesty’s Consul at Busra, who officiated until January 1878 when he gave over charge.3 AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1S77-78. 129 Slave traffic. —No slaves are known to have been landed in Oman during the year. Two Abyssinian boys imported by residents of Muscat were seized on board the British Steamer liokeby and released. Their owners were punished by the Sultan. Part IV. Trade .—The accompanying Returns show an increase in the trade of the port for the past year. The date harvest was not so good as the year before, and a considerable fall in the exportation of this item appears. An improvement is observable in the quantity of rice imported this year, but it is not up to the average. This was owing no doubt to the effects of the famine in Madras. The square-rigged vessels trading between Muscat and India are being replaced by country craft. It is found that buggalows can perform the voyage to Calcutta and back as easily and quickly as ships and several successful voyages were made last year. A steady emigration is taking place from Oman to the young and thriving kingdom of Zanzibar, and about 1,000 Arabs are known to have left the mother-country during the year to permanently settle there. The superior security and prosperity of the African Kingdom is quite sufficient to account for this state of affairs. The country has been visited during the year with heavy floods, and the rainfall has been about four times the usual quantity. The general effect has been beneficial. The customs farm was sold during the year for $106,000. (Sd.) S. B. Miles, Llent.-Col., H. B. M.’s Poltl.
