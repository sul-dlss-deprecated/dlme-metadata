According to the I. &amp; 3. Department Progress Heport dated 1st October,1945, a Publicity Officer was being despatched immediately to Teheran. The name of the individual is not mentioned, but it is quite likely that this officer is the Mohammed Anwar referred to above. One of the duties of the Publicity Officer was to supervise the distribution, by a commercial firm, of United Publications. This distribution had previously been handled through the G.O.I. However, according to the last Progress Report received (dated 1st July, 1946) distribution had broken down, the Publicity Officer had his hands full of other work, and the Government/Government of India had had to fall back on the help of the Information Department of the British Embassy, I cannot trace papers showing that we were officially notified of the appointment Of Anwar to Teheran. 28,11.19^6,Jj (f) (l-~- There appear to he no previous papers on record concerning the appointment to the Scabassy at Tehran of Mr. /inwar, Publicity Officer on the staff of the Indian Trade Commissioner.

His appointment as Attache for Indian Affairs to His Majesty^ Embassy has been notified to the Persian Government, and they have been asked to issue to him a Diplomatic Identity Booklet. Vis-a—via the Persian Government, Major Naqvi cannot have consular status, since our Consul at Tehran and any members of his staff count as diplomatists and do not hold exequaturs. Furthermore, since the member of the Mission in charge of consular affairs as a -whole only enjoys the rank of Consul-First Secretary, it would hardly be appropriate that his assistant concerned only with Indian affairs should enjoy the same rank. I would add that there is not anything derogatory in the rank of Attache, which seems appropriate to the present case of an officer temporarily appointed to a diplomatic post. Whether/ T.

Macann* Like Squire, Macann has devoted much of his time to the question of wheat supplies* This is not a specifically Indiaaquestion, though India is interested,and if we have entrusted it to the Additional Counsellor, it is because Indian Politicals have administrative experience which is of great value in this matter* We are, however, handing over immediate responsibility for watching and encouraging \tieat collection to the Middle Bast Supply Centre, and the Legation will confine itself to watching the general situation* This will reduce considerably the amount of work to be done by Colonel Macann, and he will be able, if he thinks it necessary, to devote more time to specifically Indian affairs, and in particular to visit the Consular Posts in the East and South which are staffed by the Government of India* He will also be able to give help and guidance to the Indian Trade Commissioner of whose appointment we now have very considerable hopes, fudging by telegram No*11322 of December 22nd from the Government of India to the India office^ The course of events since your letter was written has confirmed my belief that an Indian First Secretary could not have fbund work to do to justify his appointment* There is work to be done among the Indian community in Tehran, but it is not such work as could be done by a First Secretary* I have recently had correspondence with India on this question and I report it for your information* 2* When I arrived here four years ago I found that the British Indians were trying to form a club, and both I myself and the then Consul spent much time and trouble helping them to secure permission from the police, who under Reza Shah were very suspicious of such activities* I also took trouble to give an Indian party each of the first two years, and at all general parties since my arrival, e*g* the receptions for Mr* Lyttelton, Mr* Willkie etc*, a few of the leading Indians have always been invited* The Indian community, however, have not been easy to deal with* Most of them are Sikhs, who are notoriously difficult people* Hardly a single man in the community is of such status that he would be invited to the house of a high official in India* Most of them are of the petty trader or chauffeur type, and a few have become rapidly rich by the sale of motor spares* Some of the Sikhs were believed to be ill disposed towards His Majesty’s Government, and the course of the war for the first two years encouraged this disposition* The club became little more than a gambling-saloon enlivened, it was believed, by the broadcasting of the German bulletins* Eventually it collapsed through internal dissension* Squire did what he could with the Indian community when he first came but, as you can see, it was a difficult job* Sir Maurice Peterson, K* C* M* G*, The Foreign Office* 3./3* Last year Major Naqyi, a police official, was sent here by the Government of India and attached to the consulate for the purpose of examining the Indian community w ^ h ? + n T*fimovinc’ from this country any Indians who, in the event of a German break-through in the Caucasus and a subsequent move aLinst India, would be likely to work for them as guides, slies and so forth. In March 1943, Major Naavi returned to India and rendered a report commenting most unfavourably on the loyalty of the Indian cornraunity in this country. He stated that, except for one or two, they had all had close connections with German firms which had spread a wide net of 5 th-column activities among them. He maintained that the British authorities, in Persia had no means of m f ki “S an y - close contact with the Indians or of finding out what mischief thev were up to: there was no list of them and no record about them. Major Naavi considered it essential Government of India, the Legation and the Ar«y tc&gt; have an organisation which should remain in close c °' tac * Indians.* keep a record about them, and see that the wrong people were not encouraged either in trade, or t journeying to and from India. As Persia was an independent country, this organisation would require cover. Major Naavi then proposed that there should be a staff of two (pSus clerical staff) who should work openly and make contact with Indians and Persians, and secret staff to tour up an down the country and to be employed in business. Major Naavi concluded by proposing various measures of control on the Indian side of the frontier and a cultural propaganda drive among the Indians in this country. lu When commenting to the Government of India on Major Naovl’s memorandum, we expressed general agreement that .acre should be done to look after and keep track of the . community, though we also thought that Major Naqvi had rather overpainted the picture. However, the oase deportees is proceeding in India, and weavait the resul . 5. The Government of India decided that some of the Indians whom they considered most dan e e ?°^® removed to India, and at their reauest I asked the Persian Government to withdraw the residence permits of eight Indian^ whose names I gave and to send them to the Indian frontier. Persian Government carried out this readest and h eight min wereev^tually taken over by the security authorities on their arrival in India. 6. In reply to the communication of ours which I ^ ave summarized in paragraph 4, the government of india then informed me that they considered it desirable to send Major Naavi fcaek Tehran and asked that he mififht he placed (&gt; the Legation as ♦‘Attache for the Affairs of Indians in Persia , in their view it was evident that it had not been possi to give the Indian community in Persia adequate attention, with the result that insufficient control had been exercised over disaffected Indians and little or no encouragement Siven to loyal Indians. The Government of India suggested thau Maj Naqvi .should be entrusted by us with most of the work in connexion with Indians here so as to enable himto S®* understand the Indian community thoroughly and to secure a pSsmon of influence in it. Specifically, he might deal with passport work in relation to Indians a P d wishing to visit India; he might advise on Pndd *'7?!?£ution of trade and the traders handling it, and on ddstrib ^ ^ , contracts to deserving Indians here.

Department^ Please see Foreign Office letter of 12th November below about the appointment of an Indian Trade Commissioner at Tehran, Since Itr. Baggailfay's letter of 26th February 1940 to Sir William. Croft (flagged on attached E,&amp;#0, file) a number of developments have occurred, Mr, Caroe^ letter of 10th September 194C gave the Gkrvemment of India's views on Sir R, Bullard's suggestion for the appointment of a Trade Commissioner, to the effect that though the suggestion had much to commend it, the Govern ment of India would much prefer the posting of an Indian Political Service officer to one of the regular^ appointments on the Legation staff, e.g, to tb&amp;ir First Secretary. Consideration of the proposal was held up for various reasons and in their telegram No. 5302 of 8th July 1943*&gt; the Governmen|; of India again stated their preference for an Indiar^Secretary to the Legation adding that in present circumstances commercial exchanges are so hedged around by import and export controls at both ends that the usual Indian method of representation by a Trade Commissioner is inappropriate. 4$ The Foreign Office in April 1943 definitely turned down / the proposal for the appointment of an Indian First Secretary and there the matter has since rested. The Government of India's arguments in their telegram of 8th July, 1942 had perhaps an air of special pleading and it may now be found that they will welcome the appointment of an Indian Trade Commissioner, who would presumably have an office separate from the Legation - it any rate the clear course now seems to be to telegraph asking for the Government of India's views on the matter. 7503 'R’rw* owtr /■kViorimr o-4--i cul ( t ^ HV'' *1 ?.C- (‘s f •(' '4 ^ UExternal Secretary^ As w111 seen from the following figures, India 1 s trade with Pars increased enormously in recent years:- 1938-39 * 1939-40 1940- 41 1941- 42 1942- 43 Imports from Iran.

During earlier part of the v/ar chief role of our propaganda was to palliate military set-backs and keep up confidence in final victory. • 2. Now that tide of war is turning in our favour this purely military propaganda must to a large and growing extent be super seded by propaganda designed to prove to Persians that association with us is bringing and will bring them tangible benefits in--the political and economic fields. , • * . .» • , 3. To be effective, such propaganda must be backed by some degree of concrete economic and other assistance as earnest or His Majesty s Government’s declared intention to see Persia strong and •• independent after the war. / i . . 4. Active measures are being taken to ensure full publicity for “assistance at present received by Persia. Latter howeVer remains inadequate as a basis for propaganda on lines of (2) above'and must be supplemented if such propaganda is to yield results. This is a K matter of urgency since Allied occupation of Persia offers except- a/ ionally favourable conditions, which may not persist after the war, v • for exlending and advertising such economic and other benefits as our resources may permit. 5. Following suggestions for immediate assistance to Persia have accordingly been elaborated and I would recommend that they be J carefully considered with a view to determining hbw far His Majesty's Government are in fact able and willing to assist Persia and how far our propaganda can consequently go in promising and advertising such assistance. Details of Ihese suggestions are being communicated to their headquarters by the various departments V concerned. . 6. (a) Increased import quotas . ' :s Import.-.quotas fixed by the Middle East Supply Centre have hitherto been based on 'essential minimum requirements. 1 ' A general increase of all these quotas and the raising of the ban on certain imports (e.g. hats, footwear, certain toilet goods) con sidered not essential would help Persian economy. /(b)- 2 - (t&gt;) A special effort should he made to supply more ^ m achinery (especially Diesel engines) and spare parts (mainly for jerman engines). *(c) Develo-pment of trade vdth India . This would of course he of mutual benefit to Persia and India and would also indirectly benefit British interests and influence. An essential step is the appointment of an Indian Trade Commissioner in Tehran. (d) Air Transport . Persia has poor ground communications and is there fore a promising field for the development of air transport. Persian State Airlines have urgently requested one or at most two small (DH 89) aircraft from us and nrovision of these would greatly ease present transport difficulties and increase the Central Government’s authority in the provinces. If we do not prpvide them Americans will doubtless do so sooner or later. / (e) Public Works and Industrial Develo-pment . There is enormous scope for irrigation and hydro electric development in which British firms might participate, i'he first would help Persia’s basic industry, agriculture^ and at: the same time provide water power for industrial development. The Tehran area has good possibilities of this kind which are being investigated by American irrigation adviser to the Persian Government, Furthermore, the capital has not yet a piped water supply. Similar development can be carried out in and near other \large cities. With cheap power available industry (especially chemical), mining and transport could-be developed with profit. (f) Technical Hein . ' (i) The ex-Shah’s programme of industrialisation required the help of European technicians to build and run factories. Many of these were Germans. It will be some years before the Persians are good enough engineers and administrators to be independent of foreign helpj and we now have an excellent opportunity of getting rid of German influence, which is still very strong in the commercial community, by placing British technicians, and machinery in the industries and factories. The Middle East Supply Centre has a nucleus of British specialists who are working to keep Persian industry operating and would be an excellent channel through whom permanent appointments of this kind could be made. (ii) Experts are needed for the textile industry (especially the cotton section) to improve methods of production and to advise on the maintenance of existing equipment and the ordering of more machinery. They v/ould also select young Persians for training In the United Kingdom. The railway needs* trained men to take /over- 5 - ^6 over fron the Americans after the war. &lt; These should receive their training in the United Kingdom. Further more, these young technicians would be able to replace British technicians if the latter should go. Their training in England could be effected by means of British Council scholarships. Candidates should be sent for theoretical training in the Universities and for practical training in the factories. British professors should be anoointed to the Technical Colleges under the control of the Ministry of Indus try ? Commerce and Mines. . The British Council is now teaching &gt; English to the students in these colleges and within a year or less it will be possible to give instruction on xechnical subjects in the English language. The Germans staffed these colleges with their own people and used the German language for instructional purposes, German being compulsory until as recently as the end of the last school term. Five professors are needed for the Tehran College and three for the Isfahan College. (g) Cultural Actititjes . The British Council could extend their activities by opening Institutes in Shiraz. Hamadan, Meshed. Tabriz and Abadan. Each would require a staff of three people,, i.e. fifteen in aiL. The Tehran Institute could usefully employ another five. It would be Invaluable having professors appointed by them to iehran University, where six could be placed. One professor for the Kerej Agricultural College, twelve teachers of English^m other institutions, ten in seconaary schools, physical &gt; training instructors, games coaches and scoutmasters appointed and iinancea by the British Council enormously increase the scope of British . cultural propaganda. After the war, given^a stable Government in Persia, the financial liability of the British Council in this respect could probably be reduced to about two-thirds of the cost, the Persian Government bearing the rest.; (h) Medical assistance . This is clearly one of the most effective forms of propaganda amongst a backward and disease-ridden country population, and valuable work has already been achieved by the enterprise oi a local British subject (Miss Palmer-Smith) in establishing, with the help of vdlling and influential Persians, clinics and health centres in Tehran and the provinces: and by the recent provision of a mobile dispensary by G.H.Q. Paic. Latter work should if possible be repeated and extended and approach has been made in this connexion to the Minister of State, Cairo, and to the Government of India. (j) Armed Forces . It would greatly assist our credit, more especially with this section of the nation (ill-disposed towards us since the occupation, except for the Air Force), if we could (i) facili tate arrival of supplies and material recommended hy United States Army adviser; (ii) definitely promise to rehabilitate the Persian Navy as soon as possible - perhaps when Germany is /defeated(4) ■ v defeated and more small vessels are set free than can he ^ employed in the Far East; (iii) help the Air Force to reconstruct itself on British model* 7* All the above are ways in which it is suggested Persia could receive assistance which would justify our propaganda, remove to some extent the odium created by Allied occupation and its economic consequences and lay the foundations of lasting British prestige and influence in this country. Persians will, however, judge the advantages of association with Great Britain chiefly from what is offered for the post-war period. Hence British propaganda, if it is to convince the Persians on this point, must even at present be based to some extent on the advantages. Great Britain^is prepared to offer them commercially when the'war is over. It is difficult at this stage to recommend the exact lines on which Great Britain’s post-war trade policy towards Persia should run, as it v/ill clearly depend on the political status of the country after the war and on Britain’s policy in general towards her major allies. • The question will, however, be M how and by whom will Persia's economic wants be satisfied”? Assuming that Great ,,ritain wished to be one of the chief agencies in fulfilling this, the action she must take would be a continuation and widening of that suggested in the precdding paragraph.. Details of Persian import requirements and development possibilities were sent in September 1942 by 1 the Commercial Secretary to His Majesty’s Legation.to the Department of Overseas Trade, for the information of the Post-War Export Tro.de Committee presided over by Mr. Harcourt Johnston, P.C., M.P. The information in this report will be brought up to date and a further report furnished as scon as possible as a first step in the campaign to prepare for the resumption of British trade in Persia, 8. The previous paragraphs•are concerned with what Great Britain might contribute to Persia. It.will, however, also be necessary, if a strong position is to be built up in Persia, to uake from her a share of her products bearing some relation to the value of those she buys from Great Britain; or at least to ensure that she is able to dispose of her own exportable surpluses in other markets under some system of international clearing (such as tho Keynes Plan) that will prevent her bcconing tied tc a particu lar country in the way she was to Germany before, the war. It is, however, useful to bear in mind that Germany's considerable popular- ity in Persia was due tc the fact that trade between the.two countries was a more or less mutually satisfactory exchange of goods. Only some system that satisfies the above.condition will give lasting satisfaction to both parties and provide a secure boj-ps for building up British influence in Persia. '[Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong.]id , 'lit DRAFT LETTER Sir Maurice Peterson, K.C.M.G-., Foreign Office. ai» APR 1943 CONFIDENTIAL. Thank you for your letter of the 5th April, No.S.1213/1213/34&gt; on the subject of the ^\I\_ G-ovemment of India* s proposal to appoint an Indian First Secretary to the Tehran Legation. We have put your views in the matter to the ^7 A'-v t tsCji . Government of India officially ; excej/t for the objection on security grounds referred to in the last paragraph of your letter. This objection has been explained to the Viceroy privately, but Mr. Amery would like me to make it plain that he could not accept such an objection as either valid or justified. There may be some justification for this attitude as applied to the handling of secret cyphers by Indian cypher clerks, though even here our view would be that properly selected Indian clerks would prove no less trustworthy than anyone else, but for the Foreign Office to seek to apply a similar embargo on the2 - handling of cyphers or other secret matter by gazetted officers of the Government of India or/other diotenguiohed Indian public in fact to say that no Indian is to be trusted, seems to Mr* Amery to be an entirely indefensible position and one that takes no account of the high responsibilities discharged by Indians such as Sir G.S* Bajpai in Washington, ■ Sir Zafrullah Khan in Chungking and Major Himat Singh in Tokyo, to -say nothing of the Indian Representatives at the Y/ar Cabinet*MINUTE It will 'be remembered that the Government oi India*s telegram No. 5302 of July 8th 1942 put forward a proposal for the appointment of an Indian as (additional) First Secretary at H.k. Legation Tehran; that the Foreign Office (see their letter of August 31st last) could not see their way to consent to this proposal so long as the Government of India already had one of their officials at the Legation as Additional Counsellor, but instead offered to examine the desirability of appointing to the Legation an Indian Commercial Secretary; and that this alternative did not satisfy the Government of India who pressed their origin .1 proposal, which the Foreign Office were accordingly asked to re-consider in Sir L. Wakely*s letter to Sir Maurice Peterson of December 5th at Ext. 6128/42. 2. Ye have now received the Foreign Office reply, delay to:- They attribute the the necessity for consulting Sir R. Bullard, and to the fact that, after Sir R. Bullard*s views had been received ( the whole question was complicated by the proposal to appoint Mr, Squire, the Additional Counsellor at Tehran, as H.M. Minister at Kabul. (As to this, please see the submission at Ext. 1776/43, submitted concurrently, regarding a request from the F.O. that the Government of India should find another senior I.P.S. officer to succeed Mr. Squire at T ehran If the Government of India should be unable or unwilling to comply with this request they may argue that the original F«objection to the appointment of an Indian First Secretary no longer holds good - though the Foreign Office say that they do not consider that an Indian would be able adequately to perform Mr. Squire *s v/ork in connection with the wheat problem, and that their objection about access to cyphers (see below) in itself appears to preclude the appointment of an Indian. 3.7&lt;si Foreign Office proceed once more to tum down the Government of India.‘s proposal on two grounds :~ (a) that there would not be enough work for the Indian First Secretary to do. (b) that their Security authorities regard it as most undesirable that Indians should have access to Foreign Office cyphers. 4. The first of these objections apparently assumes that the Government of India will continue to provide an Additional Counsellor. It is based on the strongly expressed opinion of Sir R. Bullard, who feels that a First Secretary with nothing to do would be an encumbrance to the Legation in view of the very lirnited accommodation at their disposal. Yfe mu &gt;t presumably pass on this objection to the Government of India, though it is unlikely to satisfy them. Their own idea of the functions of the proposed official is given in paragraph 1 of their telegram No. 5302, fran which it appears that his work would be mainly, if not wholly, in the interests of India, and would lie to some extent outside the normal sphere of the Legation*s activities. They evidently feel that he would in some degree have to create his own work. Moreover the remainder of thait# telegram shows that their proposal was actuated largely by considerations of principle; they stated that the emergence of India towards Dominion status would inevitably be reflected in a demand for her fuller representation abroad, particularly in the Middle Eastern countries where she has special interests. That the Government of ^ _ India attach great importance to this aspect of the matter is shown ttu ^ a recent telegram No. 1581 of February 26th, which asked for an early reply about their proposal, ^they said that they wished 'to re—afiiim the views stated in paragraph 2 'of their telegram No.5302. 5. As regards the second objection raised by the Foreign Office, certain of their more secret cyphers are not held by the Government of India or by this Office. The Foreign Office also control the distribution of the Interdepartmental Cypher. In 1941, when the Government of India asked that the Central Cypher Bureau might be issued with a copy of the specially secret.Interdepartmental Y Recyphering Tables, they offered to ensure that it should be kept in the personal custody of the Assistant Secretary or the Superintendent of the Bureau, both of whom were, and were likely to be for— ~~m '' j. 'TN. cs^ many years, Europeans. In granting this request the Foreign Office stipulated u that the Tables should never leave the custody of these two officials'. This suggests that the Government of India will have to accept the Foreign Office’s view that this objection completely rules out the proposal* Sven if they were to contend that it would be unnecessary for the Indian First Secret ry to see the cyphers in question, the Foreign Office might cany their argument to its logical conclusion, viz. that if an official cannot be trusted with secret cyphers, he should also be denied access to unparaphrased decyphers of telegrams trans mitted in those cyphers. This would make the Government of India’s proposal quite unworkable, and it would be difficult for them to find a reply - though it is doubtful whether their own practice recognises this implication. 6. A draft telegram passing on the Foreign Office objections to the Government of India is submitted. It is suggested that the Secretary of State need neither associate himself with these objections nor anticipate the Government of India’s dissatisfaction* 7* It will be noted that the Foreign Office letter makes no reference to their earlier counter-proposal that an Indian Commercial Secretary should be appointed to the Legation. a • y ' iv.. ^ L lc_ I'e &amp;.&lt;&lt;~C^yL fc, ^ ath C*.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 5th April, 1943. / I am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter of the 5th December last, in v/hich you told me that the Government of India had reverted to their previous suggestion that an Indian should be appointed as First Secretary at the Tehran Legation. The delay has been due partly to the necessity for consulting Bullard, and partly to the fact that, after Bullard’s views had been received, the whole question was complicated by the proposal to remove Squire from Tehran. The point on which we were anxious to consult Bullard was whether there was sufficient Indian work at the Legation to justify the appointment to his staff of two officials, a Counsellor and a First Secretary, representing Indian interests. Bullard replied that 'there is certainly not enough 'work, or indeed any work, for an Indian First 'Secretary at present, and I should take it hard 'if, with accommodation so extremely short, we 'had to find room for a First Secretary who had 'nothing to do.' Bullard added that Squire advised on all matters relating to India, but that this was by no means a full time job, and /his Sir Leonard Wakely, K.G.I.E., C.B., India Office.his main work at present was the food question. We were about to write to you to this effect, when we learnt of the proposal to transfer Squire to Kabul. You will remember that Mr. Eden’s original decision, which was conveyed to you in my letter of the 31st August, was that so long as the Government of India had one of their officials in the Tehran Legation with the local rank of Counsellor, he would not feel able to consent to the appointment of an Indian First Secretary. Thus the position clearly had to be re-examined in the light of Squire’s forthcoming departure. We feel strongly that what we now need at the Tehran -Legation is an English officer of the Indian Political Service with the necessary revenue experience to succeed Squire in his work on Persian wheat production problems. I am writing separately on this point to Monteath. V/e believe that an Indian would not be able to perform this task adequately in Persia, and that a well qualified Englishman is essential. As regards the idea of appointing an Indian First Secretary in addition to Squire’s successor, v/e maintain our previous view; and you will notice Bullard’s opinion, referred to above, that there is practically no work at the Tehran Legation for an Indian First Secretary to do. There is also a further and most serious objection /toU..'- , -f—&gt;-C., -t \ ^ ^v_ he, * to the proposal to appoint an Indian Pirst Secretary to the Tehran Legation ^ec^-ity authorities have now told us that , ble point of view they regard it as gj™ office cvohers^especially d the V more C confidential ones tfruL^urthe proposal co.pletely, since Bullard could hardly be expected to ' 1 ? ke ^JS n g ho ® 1(i be whereby a senior member of his staff ahould denied access to secret matter.

The Government of India’s telegram No.5302 of July 8 th last put forward a proposal for the appointment of an Indian as (additional) First Secretary at H.M. Legation, Tehran. V/hile they apparently contemplated that the functions of the new post would, at any rate ostensibly, be mainly of a commercial nature, the first paragraph of their telegram indicated a number of other directions in which they considered it might be useful. They made it clear, however, that their proposal was actuated largely by considerations of principle; since they felt that the emergence of India towards dominion status would inevitably be reflected in a demand for her fuller representation abroad, particularly in the countries of the Middle East where she has special interests. They added that they had provisionally selected Major A.S.3. Shah for the post. 2. The Government of India had consul^tted H.M. Minister at Tehran, who had apparently discouraged the proposal on the grounds that (a) arftj^ Indian First Secretary would probably be unable to achieve much result, and (b) objections were to be anticipated from the Persian Government. Exactly what objections are to be expected has never been explained to us, but it was surmised here that they would be directed either against the appointment of an Indian as such, or against the appointment of a representative of a country which is not fully self-governing. It Should be possible to overcame the second objection by explaining to the Persians that the r official status of the post would be in no sense that of a representative of India, but simply that of a member of the Legation under the orders of H.M. Minister. 3. The Government of India’s telegram was forwarded to the Foreign Office under cover of a letter No. Ext.3620/42 of July 30th, which strongly supported their proposal. The Foreign Office reply, dated August 31st, said that the ^ Government of India’s proposal had been submitted to Mr. Eden, who did not feel able to consent to the appointment of an Indian First Secretary ;at the Tehran Legation so long as the Government of India already had one of their officials there with the local rank of Counsellor (viz., Mr. Squire of the Indian Political Service). They observed that the appointment in addition of an Indian First Secretary ’’would mean that two of the highest posts oft Bullard’s staff would be held by the Government of India’s nominees”, and they did ’’not feel able either to accept such a position or to regard it as likely in any way to satisfy the future India”. Their letter, in fact, gave the impression that they suspected the Government of India of a disingenuous attempt to flood the Legation with their officials in order to Qbfc&amp;kti the control over our policy towards Persia which they had unsuccessfully endeavoured to secure last year. On the other hand, they offered to examine further, in consultation with Sir R. Bullard, the desirability of appointing to the Legation an Indian Coramercial Secretary ’’with the functions /O^Uckthe title implies”. 4-. It ■'was considered here that although the Foreign Office counter proposal was unlikely to satisfy the Government of India, they might possibly accept it as the thin end of the wedge - hoping that they would be able gradually to enlarge the scope of the Commercial Secretary* s functions in the direction of a more general representation of India. The Foreign Office views and counter proposal were therefore put briefly to the Government of India in the Secretary of State’s telegram No.lolob of September 14-th. 5 . The Government of India's express letter below makes it /clear■■■ wmmm * 2 . clear that they would be far from satisfied with the proposed Commercial Secretary, and they ask that the foreign Office should reconsider their refusal to accept the original proposal. They emphasise that both the existing Additional Counsellor and the proposed Indian First Secretary would be additional to the Foreign Office officials of those grades on the Legation staff; and they adduce the fact that half the cost of the Tehran Legation is met from Indian revenues as a reason why due weight should be given to their wishes. The G-overmnent of India’s letter does not provide us with much material with which to go back to the Foreign Office, but the draft below endeavours to make the best of what there is. One ground on which we can press for a fair reconsideration is that we obligingly went back to the G-overnment of India with the proposal for a Commercial Secretary, though we ourselves were very doubtful whether they would accept it.J Ext.6128/42 DRAFT LETTER. Sir Maurice Peterson, K.O.M.G., Foreign Office. My dear Pewrson, On receiving your letter of August 31st last, # No. E. 46 20/33/34, v/e sent a telegram to the G-overament of India explaining Mr. Eden* s objections to their proposal for the appointment of an Indian as First Secretary at H.M. Legation at Tehran. We also passed on to them your offer to consult Bullard v/ith regard to the appointment of an Indian Commercial Secretary at the Legation, although we ourselves considered it unlikely that this would meet their wishes. 2. We have now received a reply from the Government of India/which MnmTT ibrrl it i “ J ‘ ‘ they make it clear that they would not regard the appointment of an Indian Commercial Secretary with functions limited to the implications of that title as being of any real advantage to India in present circumstances^ when trade is so hedged around by official controls /(compare(compare paragraph 1 of 'their 'telegram No*5302 of July 8 th). They do not altogether comprehend your objection to 'tv/ocf the highest posts on Bullard’s staff” being 'held by the Government of India’s nominees', since they have never suggested that officers from India should displace Foreign Office officials»Squire holds the post of Additional Counsellor by which he does not qualify to act as Charge' d’Affaires in the Minister's absence. Similarly, if an Indian were appointed with the rank of First Secretary he would be an additional officer of that rank. The Government of India understand that there are several Embassies and Legations -where there are now two or more First Secretaries. Cfen ft 3 . In the light of these ^ii'uui.u h-me rs the Government of India trust that the Foreign Oxfice •will be preoared to reconsider the matter^ and they suggest that India's financial contribution towards the cost of the Tehran Legation justifies the expectation that due weight will be given to their proposal. Mr. Amery desires me to say that he xUally* /supports 4.(id) 3. supports the Government of India’s views r I n mil fi-r,., nra bnpofi that the Foreign Office will disabuse their minds ef any suspicion that the Government of India's desire for the appointment to the Tehran Legation of a further officer from India in any way betokens an attempt to increase their influence at Tehran at- the expense of H.M.G., or to secure the control over our Persian policy which they were denied last year in the circumstances described in your letter. Mr. Amery therefore hopes that Mr. Eden will be prepared to reconsider the G-overnment of India's proposal on its merits with a view to pursuing the t matter in consuljfation with Sir R. Bullard. 1 Tours sincerely, ia K C ? S T G0VEHNT T 3'IT OF INDIA. External Affairs Department. To - Zenodotia, London, io. 4230-NP/42.

Similarly if an Ihdian were appointed in the rank of First aecreoary he would be an additional officer in that rank. l Ve understand that there are several Embassies and Legations where there are now two or more First Secretaries. 3. In light of the above we trust that Foreign office will be prepared to re-consioer the matter.

Bullard with regard to the appointment of an Indian commercial secretary. They may feel that such an appointment would be the thin end of the wedge, and that they would be able gradually to enlarge the scope of the post in the direction of more specific representation of India. (There would presumably be no objection to the Indian commercial secretary handling from the outset the Indian community in Tehran, since,in regard to earlier proposals. Sir R. Bullard himself referred to the importance of this task). 7/e do not know why the Foreign Office have replied to our official letter in this somewhat unusual form; but we feel that the manner of their reply may make it more appropriate to consult the Government of India through the pyivatg and personal channel rather than officially. If you agree, we will submit aUU &lt;4 U \V() &lt; 2 Tl &lt;x&lt;&lt;CQi (E 4620/33/34 ) l FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 31st August, 1942. ]{&amp; ^ *** h* Mr. Eden has now seen India Office official letter No* Ext 3620/42, of the 30th July, regarding the Government of India’s desire to appoint an Indian as First Secretary in the British Legation at Tehran, and I am writing to let you know his views. You may remember that last summer the Government of India urged strongly their view that our Persian policy should thenceforward be co-ordinated and controlled from India (see their telegram No. 3662 of the 19th July, and the Governor-General’s telegram No. 1987 G, of the ' s .&lt;nM* V - 2 l St August, 1941). OnHBeing informed that tai 1 was not acceptable to His Majesty's Government, they put forward the further proposal (see the 1 .Governor-General’s telegram No. 2403 3, of the a ^3rd September, 1941) that Squire, then Consul- General at Meshed, should be ajjpointed to the Tehran Legation* as a Counsellor* After some discussion here as regards the conditions of this appointment, it was agreed that Squire should . become a Counsellor at the Legation, and he eventually took up that post and has since been doing very good work. The main argument in favour of the proposal for an Indian First Secretary, as we understand Sir Leonard Wakely, K.C.I.E., India Office^ C.B. ,understand it, is that the future India, when she obtains her new status, is likely to went more representation abroad. But the appointment of an Indian First Secretary to the. Legation would mean that two of the highest posts on Bullard’s staff would be held by the Government of India’s nominees, and we do not feel able either to accept such a position or to regard it as likely in any way to 5 ; satisfy the ’future India. So long therefore as the Government of India have one of their officials in the Tehran Legation with the local rank of Counsellor, ivi r« Eden would not feel able to consent to the appointment of an Indian First Secretary. On the other hand, he would, if hr. Amery wishes, be prepared to examine further, in consultation with Bullard the desirability of appointing an Indian Commercial Secretary to the Legation. We do not ourselves see any special reason against the appointment of an Indian Commercip.1 Secretary, with the functions which the title implies, but we would naturally wish to ascertain Bullard’s views on this subject before the suggestion is. pursued further*Minute. During the last few years the question of Indian representation in Tehran has emerged in various forms. These may he summarised under two headings (a) Appointment of an Indian Political Service Officer to the staff of the Tehran Legation. Apparently this proposal was first discussed in 1935. In September 1940 (P.Z.5264/40) it was revived by the Government of India, who thought that such an officer should he able to help H.M. Minister to appreciate Indian interests in Persia, to act as a sort of liaison officer between him and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to help the Commercial Secretary in dealing with Indian trade matters, to handle the Indian community in Tehran, and, more generally, to ”focus attention on the importance of Persia, and events there, to India in almost all fields.” This proposal, however, was not pursued ov/ing to the objections raised by Sir R. Bullard, who made it clear that he regarded it as based on an exaggerated idea of the amount of work handled by the Legation which directly concerned the Government of India (P.Z.6524/40); in his opinion, therefore, the officer would not have enough to do. In the altered situation created by the Anglo-Russian occupation of August last, the Viceroy again revived the project: this time he proposed that - as a war measure - an I.P.S. officer should be appointed to the Legation staff as Additional Counsellor so that he might (a) keep the Minister and the Government of India t respectively, promptly and fully informed of each other’s viewpoint in all matters of common interest, and (b) help the Minister in semi-political, semi-administrative v/ork relating to such matters as communications, famine relief, security, etc. This proposal was approved by the War Cabinet (see Minutes dated 30th September 1941 and the papers below them); and we have every reason to believe that Mr, Squire, the officer appointed to the new post, is successfully discharging the functions just described. (b) \ v Appointment of a Trade Representative. Up to last year, the official guardians of Indian trade interests in Persia were the Commercial Secretary to the Legation and the Indian Trade Commissioner at Alexandria. Early in 1940, however, Sir R. Bullard suggested in a letter to Mr. Caroe dated 15th May 1940 (flagged) that an Indian Trade Commissioner should be appointed to Tehran. The Government of India, however, countered with their proposal for the posting of an I.P.S, officer to the Legation (see (a) above). The question was further held up by.the development of the activities of U.K.C.C. in Persia, and^ the consequent proposal that an Indian business man should , be sent to Persia to help them in their investigations. ' It was not until the summer of 1941 that the Government of India sent Mr. M.H. Ismail, formerly Indian Trade Commissioner in East Africa, to Tehran as Indian Trade Representative for two months in the first instance (Ext.3366/41). It appears that this term was extended, and that Mr. Ismail is still in Tehran. Presumably he has an office apart from the Legation, but v/orks in close co-operation therewith. 2. The proposal in the Government of India’s telegram that an Indian First Secretary should be appointed to the Tehran Legation differs in important respects from the suggestions which have been discussed hitherto. The holder of the new post, unlike Mr. Squire, would be first and foremost a representative of India, and would be occupied exclusively in work of Indian interest; and, unlike Mr. Ismail (whom he would presumably supersede) his,functions would not be purely economic. As regards- 2 - the other spheres of activity enumerated in paragraph 1 of the Government of India’s telegram, it will he observed that in his letters of May 15th and October 19th 1940 (latter flagged at P.Z. 6524/40) Sir R. Bullard referred to the handling of the Indian community of about 200-300 - mostly traders - in Tehran, as a task of some importance. In the field of propaganda, the presence at Tehran of an Indian representative v/ith experience of the Government of India’s foreign propaganda organization may well be valuable in ensuring the necessary co-operation between the Government of India and the Public Relations Bureau at the Legation. In the past we have had various indications that these bodies were out of touch and that misunderstandings had consequently arisen. r) Jb sc ^ ^ tu; U *■ r******^ 3. Although the Government of India consider that the holder of the new post would be able to do valuable work, they treat his appointment largely as a question of principle; and as such it appears to be a sound, and indeed inevitable, development. Now that India has Agents-General in Washington and Chungking, it seems logical that she should also have a representative in Persia, v/ith v/hich India is, of course, far more closely associated by tradition than she is v/ith either the United States or China. The fact that these two officers*have already been appointed should serve to overcome Persian objections, v/hich are presumably based upon the fact that India has not yet the standing of an independent nation. In the reverse direction, Peraa already has, by virtue of her most-favoured-nation rights, a Consul-General at the Headquarters of the Government of India. If she were to ask that this official should become a Commissioner, like the representatives of the United States and / China, there would presumably be no objection.* 4. Major Shah, whom the Government of India have provisionally selected for the new post, is about 40,' and is at present serving as Deputy Secretary in the External Affairs Department. The Government of India do not go into the question of the terms to be given him at Tehran; nor do they say whether they are prepared to bear the whole cost of the appointment, or whether they expect H.M.G. to bear half binder the usual arrangements for the division of the diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia. 5. A draft letter to the Foreign Office is submitted supporting the Government of India's proposal, subject to any further consultation with H.M. Minister (who is apparently doubtful of its value) which may be considered necessary. 6 . The Secretary of State has recorded a note on the copy of the telegram below the file copy. I E. &amp; O. t945. Secretary, E &amp; 0 Department For concurrence or any observations. • • (S.MI-VKyr-v This Department v/eloomed the idea in l^A-0 of an Indian Trade Commissioner in Telman and in principle the saj.ie approach applies to the present proposal for an Indian commercial representative there. It is not quite clear from the Government of India’s telegram but I assume^ the intention to be that the proposed Indian Jirst Secretary v/ould absorb the functions of the present Indian Trade Commissioner. The tendency in recent times must have been for the work of the latter to shrink, for far from fostering trade, it has become necessary to pin dov/n the x j eoples of middle Eastern areas including Persia to fixed tonnages of essential commodities calculated to meet their needs and no more and to discourage luxury trading all together, fe^thereby shipping space can be saved. ,/hile I mention these restrictive tendencies, I should also add that the proximity of India as a convenient supply area has tended to bring the two countries more into each other’s trading orbit and there has recently been a noticeable effort to expand land traffic between them. These trends may well have their effect on post-war trade. /(, f . (*y- cLj^ c% Jj^ la •i* lCJU In k Iv^vv^ few ^ cU w. &amp;~t ttL C, fu*jt A ■£ ^ 1 bbo «W-f ^ ^ LjjU.

Mr.Amery attaches great importance to the establishment of good relations between India and her neighbours in the Middle East, and he Ihuii.fsupports the Government of India’s proposal. He agrees with their view that, with the emergence of India towards Dominion /status2 . 31 - 0 . 11 . 118 , il will b© inevitable that a demand will gj~j _30 ioi* her representation abroad, noie paiticalarly in a neighbouring- country like Persia with whom India has long been closely associated Doth by culture aid tradition, and he feels that it is very desirable, in anticipation of such a demand, to utilise the opportunity presented by our^present special relationship with the Persian Government to im r rocnu*!* an Indian ro r -r- : • th- Legation as a first step A. ee-e***** fix j towards some fuller arrangement/for iwdian representation /such as is nov; m existence in Washington and Chungking. ^ -hi &amp; Jim. d &lt;1 A+j-iet*** He would hope thatTany objections which the Persian Goveinment might see to the proposed appointment might be overcome without any great difficulty by an explanation on the above lines of the common interests, bpth commercial and cultural, which unite the two countries, ard of the special position of India in the British Commonwealth of Nations. 3 . Mr.Amery hopes, therefore, that Mr .Eden, after any further consultation with H.M.Minister, Tehran, /which3 /^f which he may deem necessary, will feel able to agree, and will cause the necessary steps to be taten to inform the Persian Government of the intention to put the Government of India*s proposal into effect.

The main point is that an Indian should he appointed to the Legation as a first Secretary, and the anticipated Persian objections would no doubt be partly to having an Indian at all, but also partly to the ^ inclusion in the British Legation of a representative of a country which is not self-governing. Para.2 of the Government of India’s telegram is no doubt intended to deal with the second objection. Possibly the draft letter to the Foreign Office makes too much of this point and I have therefore re-drafted para. 2 . We certainly did not intend to suggest that at this stage at any rate the appointment should be a parallel one to those in Washington and Chungking. It is more a question of inserting the thin end of the v/edge with the Persians. As regards the functions of the Indian Secretary I read the Government of India as meaning that these will be ostensibly in the commercial sphere, and that India’s Commercial connection with Persia will be the main reason given to the Persians for the appointment; in fact however under the disguise of a Commercial Secretary he will devote most of his attention to points (a) to (d) of para.l of the Government of India’s telegram. uI am not at present at all clear as to the official status and functions proposed to he attached to this post (paragraph 3 of the Government of India's telegram speaks of the functions referred to in paragraph 1 as non-official), or as to the guise in which the proposed aupointment is to he put before the Persian Government* £ The mere title 'Indian Secretary’ is open to all sorts of interpretations* We should he wiser if we had seen the correspondence between India ^ Tehran referred to in paragraph 2 'of the telegram; hut I assume this is not available? The Departmental noting and the draft proceed on the assumption that the post is to he one of a new description, directly representing India and comparable more or less to the appointments at Washington and Chungking. I am quite prepared to think that this is ♦ ^ ■i- * right;- hut is it altogether clear that the Government of India mean to go so far at this stage? The essential feature of the present proposal, as I understand it, and2 . feature in which it differs from the previous proposals, is that the officer appointed should be an Indian] and I had myself in fact supposed, on first reading the Government of India’s telegram, that it was to this that it was anticipated that the Persians would object, and that the Government of India’s idea at present was no more than to ’break the ice* by appointing an Indian officer to a post of First Secretary, without representing the post to the Persians as being of a new description or as carrying any functions essentially different from those of other posts on the legation staff, though no doubt it would be indicated that it would be specially concerned with matters affecting India, (The nominal functions on this theory wiii be, I suppose, whatever part of the work of the legation the Minister thought fit to assign to the post). The proposed officer is, I observe, to work ’under cover of the Legation*, whatever that may imply# Probably the Government of India have made clearer to the Minister twhat they propose, and he would be in a position therefore to make it sufficiently clear to the Persians// 3. But it would be unsatisfactory that we should be in any doubt here. Would it not be desirable to get something clearer from India before proceeding further? (Unless of course you, or the Foreign Off ice, can in the light of fuller knowledge clear up the points raised above).The Under Secretary of State Foreign Offic S.W. 1.

Application has already been made to Iranian Consul^ General for visa and we propose that he should travel overland via Z.ahidan and Meshed. Air passage would be difficult to arrange and we think that there is advantage in Indian representative travelling via Eastern Persia. Ismail speaks perfect English but has only literary knowledge of Persian. 3* Ismail will engage whoXe«time clerk locally, but we would bo grateful for your assistance, if possible, in provision of, at any rate part-tim*, confidential typist and servant who could do duty also as orderly.

His views, with which I agree entirely, are as follows. 2. Your paragraph 3. Iranian Government is not a seller of wool, as proposed export monopoly hy syndicate has not materialised. Iranian Government cannot therefore guarantee quality or price. Normally purchases for export must he approved hy syndicate hut my agreement eliminates this condition, leaving me free to huy from syndicate members or elsewhere. This enables me to secure qualities required provided I am not too late hut there is ample wool available to absorb kran funds. There is no Government control of price, which will depend on qualities purchased and extent of competition. Germany is in the same position as ourselves. There are local experts available whom I propose to employ. I am satisfied that proposed arrangement gives maximum security. 3. Your paragraph 4. Position of United Kingdom Commercial Corporation will become untenable if 30,000 tons of wheat provided for in preliminary agreement are now refused. It was the offer of this wheat which secured the agreement and if it is refused [? it is] unlikely that we shall be allowed to buy any wool.

The position seems to be as follows. There is a Commercial Secretary at Tehran who is very busy, oartly with Indie's trade interests. His s^lr^y, unlike the salaries of the other members of the Legation staff, which are paid half by His Majesty's Government and half by the Government of India, is at present paid^ entirely by His Majesty's Government. We are investigating this and shall probably write to you shortly for India s contribution. Bullard at one time advocated the appointment of an Indian Trade Commissioner, but he seems now to have withdrawn his suggestion, on the ground that it would not be worth the extra expense involved to His Majesty s Government. Such an appointment would mean either that His Majesty's Government would have to renounce any claim that India should pay half the salary of the Commercial Secretary, or would have to share the cost oi the newcomer. India would prefer the appointment of a Political Officer. But'Bullard thinks that a Political Officer would not find enough to do. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation now have a representative in Iran who is trying to develop^ trade between that country, the United Kingdom and India. R. T* Peel, 3sq., M.C*How this will affect the commercial work of the Legation it is at present impossible to say, hut I should think that any increase of* trade would he dealt with almost entirely by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation representative himself# On the other hand, the commercial work at the Legation may he increased by the contraband and enemy export control organised by the Ministry of Sconomic Warfare# The situation, in brief, is by no means clear at the moment, and though Bullard seemed decidedly of the opinion last October that no increase in his staff was justified, there may be a change soon in the volume of work which would cause him to revise his opinion# But this seems unlikely at present, as a Secretary was^ withdrawn from Tehran last year, with Bullard s approval, and the post of Counsellor has now been temporarily suspended, probably for the duration, at Bullard’s own suggestion*^ ! We will however ask him to let us know of any change in his views#Ii.DXA Ol’i I J-.. C'o') iGonomic &amp; Cverceas T.

Further consideration has been given to the question of trade rith Iran and also with Iraq in the light of the increasing influence which Germany is obtaining in both countries. It is important from the strategic point of view that neither Iran nor Iraq, particularly the latter at this juncture, should throw themselves politically into the &gt;• rms of the Axis. e are not in a position at present to counter tMs Incasing Germ 3 .il iitfluence by military measures and it is therefore necessary to examine t e possibility ^ of a political demonstration in the economic field. To this end it has been decided that.the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation should extend their activities to Iran and Iraq with a view to organising on the one hand increased iritieh purchases of the products of these countries, and thus reduce the danger of their believing that they are dependent on the Axis and Russia for their markets, and on the other hand increased supplies of British roods,^ jnd thus take advantage of the difficulty which Ge.rman exporters experience in delivering goods to the Middle Last. 3. The obstacles in the path of this policy are consider le, particularly in Iran. Germany has been able to obtain a great hold over the Iranian export trade and has already built up substantial agencies for the sale of their own exports. Moreover, the inability of the United Kingdom to supply Iran /.ith military equipment, locomotives and steel rails, to which the Iranian Government attach importance, has prejudiced the atmosphere. The fact that India also cannot now after all supply steel rails, may have a further unfortunate effect if the Iranians have to* any extent] been counting on them. Consequently, it would be necessary for the United Kin. dom Commercial Corporation to move cautiously to begin with. As the Iranian Government are unlikely to i elcome the sale of Iranian produce for sterling unless there is a likelihood of their being able to use the sterling thus acquired for the purchase of their import reouirsments, the success of the Corporation in buying Iranian goods is likely to be proportion ite to their ability to deliver f rom Lmpire sources ^ods/MeiL.Iran ;ants. ihis is also true, although possibly to a less serious extent, in Iraq. Consequently, if they are to succeed, the Corportation Till require the fullest possible backing .vhich the supply position allov. from His M jesty’s Governnent and other Impire Governments, particularly t e Government of India. 4. A copy is enclosed of the minutes of a meeting of a Committee which has been formed to consider this question. This document sets out the position in a summary and provisional 7 ay as regards the principal articles exported by Iran and Iraq and as regards the articles which Iran and Iraq wish to import. Copies are also enclosed of telegrams which have been sent to His Majesty’s Representatives in Tehran and Baghdad. I would be glad if the Government/Government of India would consider the position and inform me by telegram as soon as possible of any suggestions which they wisn to make for the furtherance of the policy indicated in paragraph 2 above* In particular (a) what are the possibilities of the increased consumption in India of any Iranian or Iraqi products, such as raw cotton, leather and gum tragacanth? In this connection, I have already consulted you regarding. Iraqi unpaciied dates in my telegram do. 7173 of 14th November to the Commerce Department. (b) what can be done to increase the export to Iran and Iraq of Indian goods such as cement, rail, ay waggons and cotton piecegoods? 5 . It will be essential for the United Kingdom Commercial Cor oration to maintain close contact with the Indian market for Iranian and Iraqi products and with Indian suppliers. At present, as an interim measure, this contact will be maintained at my request through the India Office and the Government of India, but some more direct channel seems desirable, particularly for the disposal of small Questions. In the circumstances the Corporation are considering’ the advisability of appointing a representative in India and I assume that you would welcome such an appointment which would seem likely to facilitate the Corporation’s activities not only in respect of Iran and Iraq but in respect of other territories also in which they operate* 6 * It is'possible that the appointment of an Int iar_ trade agent at Tehran would assist the Corporation’s endeavours while fostering Indian trade, but the Corporation wish to nave a few month!’ experience of the handling of the responsibility entrusted to them before forming an opinion of che desirability of such an appointment from their point of view, and until they have had this experience I would prefer to reserve my o.vn judgment on the suggestion. An alternative suggestion for the appointment of a political officer to the Staff of the Legation, which was made demi-official by your foreign Secretary in September, is still under consideration here, but even if it should be agreed and acted u on, I am not sure th t it would not be advisable to consider the appointment of an official who could devote himself solely to the duties of a Trade Agent. I should welcome your viewrs. If the Government of India should in principle be willing to appoint a trade agent I would cohsult other Departments of Die Majesty’s Government and the United kingdom Commercial Corporation on the proxjosal • (Sgd.)

F.493-N/39 dated the 10th September, about my suggestion that an Indian r Jrade Commissioner should be appointed to Tehran. I did not know that the Government of India paid half the salary of the Commercial Secretary at Tehran. In that case the appointment of a Trade Commissioner would mean that His Majesty’s Government would have to pay more for their Commercial Secretary, and I could not be responsible for that in these expensive days. My proposal then falls to the ground, for the present at The financial aspect apart it had great advantages, in view of the growing possibilities of trade between Iran and India, at least in war time. Nor was the suggestion that an Indian Trade Commissioner should keep an eye on the Indian community as far-fetched as it might seem at first sight. Nearly all the Indians here are in business and most of them trade with India, so that the Trade Commissioner would meet most of the community in the course of his work and would naturally use his influence, based on a closer knowledge than we possess, with them. The alternative suggestion, that a member of the Indian Political should be appointed to the staff of the Legation in Tehran, is I think open to more than one objection. If he were additional to the present staff he would have little to do, while the substitution of such an officer for a First Secretary trained in Foreign Office ways would not be satisfactory. Caroe perhaps made his suggestion in the belief that a very large proportion of the work of the Legation directly concerns the Government of India. I have not made an analysis, but speaking off-hand I must say that that belief is far from the ftucts, and while it is true that an Indian Political might find ways in which the interests of the H.L. BAGGALLAY, ESq. /GovernmentGovernment of India could receive additional attention, I still do not think that he would find enough to do, as an additional member of the staff, to give him or the Government of India any satisfaction. I am sending a copy of this letter to Garoe. Yours ever, (Signed) R.W. Bullard. « .IH f fairs CONFIDENTIAL. 2w,^ g.

We have carefully considered Bullard r s suggestion for the appointment of a Trade Commissioner from India to Tehran which has much to commend it, but would much prefer the posting of an Indian Political Service officer to one of the regular appointments on the Legation Staff e.g. to that of First Secretary. 3. There is already a Commercial Secretary on the Legation Staff . whose pay is met half by His Majesty r s Government and half by the Government of India and who is presumably supposed to look after the Government of India's trade interests equally with those of His Majesty's Government. Further the general handling of the Indian community in Tehran could hardly be considered one of the functions of a Trade Commissioner or Commercial Attache. 4. The question of the appointment of an Indian Political Service officer to the staff of His Majesty's Legation at Tehran was discussed when Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Kugessen visited Delhi in 1935 and is referred to under (d) in paragraph 1 of Metcalfe's X * unnumbered confidential letter of the 8th December 1935 to Walton, but the proposal does not appear to have since been considered. Such an officer should be able to help His Majesty's Minister to appreciate I n dian interests in Iran, could act as a sort of ItECo. POL DE** I r• 2 - liaison officer between him and the Political Resident Persian Gulf and should also be able to give the Commercial Secretary considerable assistance in dealing with Indian trade matters. H# would also of course be useful in handling the Indian community in Tehran. Such an appointment moreover would focus attention on the importance of Iran, and events in Iran, to India in almost all fields, and would be in accord with the large contribution which India mahes towards diplomatic and consular expenditure in that country* 5. I should be grateful if you could kindly let me know after consulting the Foreign Office whether the proposal is likely to prove acceptable to His Majesty’s Government. If so, I will take it up officially. I would note that, as it is proposed that the Indian Political Service officer should hold one of the ordinary appointments on His Majesty’s Legation staff, it is presumed that so long as the present dispensation lasts, his pay would be met half by His Majesty’s Government and half by the Government of India in the ordinary manner. If our proposals for the division of expenditure in Iran and the Persian Gulf are accepted, we should I think have to agree that the whole of his pay should be met from Indian revenues* 6.

Addressed by Secretary of State for India to Government of India repeated to Tehran Do. 146. Your telegram No. 1622 of 21st Iday. Your suggestion for War Trade Agreement with Iranian Government under which in return for supply of railway material and other goods they would undertake to limit their exports to Germany, has been carefully considered, but H.M.G. agree with view expressed in Tehran telegram No. 147 of 23 th Nay that there is no hope of its acceptance by Iran. Insofar as Iranian produce can reach Germany via Black Sea or Russian railways we can deny it to Germany only by providing alternative markets. 2. Negotiations for purchase of wool have now broken down. The other Iranian commodity mainly in question is cotton. U.h. is at present over-stocked with cotton and there would be shipping difficulties in getting Iranian cotton here• Arguments for its pre-emption on economic warfare grounds are less strong than in the case of wool since cotton would be less useful to Germany. E.L.G. are therefore not prepared to purchase it. 3* Proposed barter arrangement under which French contemplated taking Iranian cotton has come to nothing, but it appears from secret information that Japanese are in negotiation for 3*300 tons of next year’s crop. Italy has purchased 8,0GC tons of Iranian cotton valued at £600,GOO, payment to be ma.de by £130,000 in cash, 23,000 tons of cement valued at £73,000 and piecegoods valued at £373,000. Italy’s entry into the war will make it difficult to implement this agreement and you may care to consider possibility of barter of Indian cement and piecegoods against Iranian cotton. 4. I suggest you explore further the possibility of the absorption in Indian market of Iranian and also Afghan cotton in partial replacement of India's normal cotton imports especially American. Natural market would seem to be India and I suggest you consider drawing at any rate Afghan there as a permanent policy. You may also care to consider possibility of stimulating the trade at the outset by stipulating that such cotton should be used in some Government contracts for piecegoods. I imagine that for political reasons you will wish to give Afghan cotton preference and weight would also have to be given to interests of some other sources from which India imports cotton, viz. African Colonies and Egypt. 3» Other Iranian products of interest from economic warfare point of view are cottonseed, leather and gum tragacanth. Is there any possibility of market being found in India for these commodities?Copy. (E 2069/145/34). No 44/3/40. With the compliments of His Majesty’s Representative.

Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office.ilo. 244/3/40. 15th May 1940 Dear Mr.Caroe, Tnere has been much correspondence with Inuia concerning the proposal that a trade mission should come from India to J-ran to discuss trade between the two countries. I mentioned it more than once to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Commercial Secretary has spoken of it at the Ministry of Commerce, but although the advantages are obvious the Iranian Government nave not given their approval and I fear that they are not likely to do so. Meanwhile it is clear that there are opportunities for trade both ways, and that if they could be studied on the spot by an Indian expert it would be a gooa thing. It has occurred to us that it would be worth while for India to send a Trade Commissioner to Tehran. This would be particularly appropriate as nearly all the trade with India is in the hands of Indians. I imagine that if the project was approved an Indian would be appointed: m that case he should be a Moslem of good status - such a man, if you have any more of them, as Saiyid Lai Shah, the excellent official you sent to Jedda as Indian Vice-Consul. To be of full value the Trade Commissioner should be able to handle the Indian community of two or three hundred, most of them Sikhs - a job which I suppose could best be done by an Englishman, but we hardly hope for that. I hope that the Department of External Affairs will consider this proposal sympathetically, if only because our Commercial Secretary, who deals with Indian as well as other British trade, has too much to do. The Foreign Office nave said that they have no objection to my putting this suggestion to you privately. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr.Baggallay. Yours sincerely, O.K.Caroe, C.I.S.

I think it is an excellent thing that Prior and Bullard should have got to know each other at the present juncture and it certainly does seem the greatest pity that the Tehran Legation cannot be given more of a Middle East background. Bo you think it would be worth while reviving an old suggestion - last made in Hugessen f s time - that the Legation should comprise one Officer of the Indian Political Service?^ We are spend ing a certain amount of money on secret service on Afghanistan used for payment of judicious subsidies in the right quarters. Could not something of the kind be done in Persia also? The money could be used if nothing else for keeping the Poles going.

Normally he looks gloomy but when he smiles he has a ver^ charming expression. In appearance he 1^-oks ratner like a block Deputy Comais ioner, and he is short and not very impres sjv&lt;L I am told that he can take a strong line on occasion and that he once lumped into his car and took a letter back to the Ministry o Foreign Affairs that he disapproved of. I shu say he had courage and guts but he is an incurable pessimist, which is a disaster. He is handicapped by not being a diplomat, and has two perfectly useless assistants, Roberts and Crowtwho look on him rather as we shd regard a provincial service officer. Neither know a word of Persian, neitherknow anything about Persia, neither have any idea except to get away at the first opportunity, neither have the re motest idea of what we shd be doing. Both, particularly tha l&amp;t- er are hostile to India, and neither are the slightest use to Bul lard. He did not send for either or consult them in any way when he was dealing with me. Underwo d tho military attache- is first class and we art; fortunate to have him there.

Eve ry broadcast supplies him with some fresh piece Oi. gloom, and il he can find, some gloomy patch he positively has a roll in it. ~ach time I pointed out the bright side and got his tail up a bit but flop it went again, .hen I arriveo he was still very gloomy about th situation, but cd gibe me nothing definite. 1 told him that we had seen many worse situations in Persia, and had always Cume up smiling, and that the I.B.P. to take one case alone, had b an through enough adventures to fill several books. I pointed out that he had a fine high brick wall, and three Persian division at hand, ana so far no sign whatever of definite merman moves, and in the end he chxeered up a bit. As I was going 1 thanked him for his hospitality and said that 1 must have been a great nuisance coming at this time, but he said that it was a very good thing that I had come, and that he felt &amp;11 the better for it . . I talked with al- kinds oi people ana sent otewara round the back door while fas X went to the front, and we covered the ground as thoroughly as cd be done. There is no news wh&amp;tevev of any definite German plans, and no signs of any, but there is o 'obviously a case for taking all possible precautions and this is being done.

As I was leaving the Minister informed me that I there were signs that the Iranians were alive to the danger and beginning to take steps to meet it* They have shown no hesitation in dealing with either Germans or Italians in the provinces* 4* You will see that I have suggested closer attention be paid to Isfahan. There are forty Gemans here in influential positions and now that our consulate is closed there is no one to keep an eye on them. It is in the Shiraz consular district, but Isfahan is by far the more important of the two, and the consulate ought to be there and not in Shiraz* You are, of course, aware why the change was raadeJ 5* I am enclosing two copies of the note in case you wish to send one to Peel. Now that the airmail is stopped we have no means of communication with the India Office exceptpound the Cape, and that is so slow as to be scareely worth while* 6. The Legation have no information regarding the protection of the oil areas and were consequently unable to show me anything* Yours sincerely, Sd/- C*G. Prior* O.K.Caroe, Esquire, CIE*, ICS*, Secretary to the Govt, of India in the External Affairs Department, Simla* To His Majesty’s Minister* 1. In 1938 my predecessor initiated certain proposals for the defence of the Gulf in War-time, of which a copy has been sent to the Legation, and these proposals suggested that in the event of a major war Bushire should not be defended, but should be evacuated. The Service Departments at home, and the General Staff in India, the External Affairs Department tentatively accepted this view, but the latter two added that the defence of the Gulf was primarily the concern of His Majesty’s Government. 2. I do not agree with my predecessor’s view, which omitted, inter-alia, to take into account the fact that this evacuation would mean the severance of the cable link with India for both Iran and Iraq* % view is that Bushire should be held as a base from which we can help other ports and British subjects inland, and as the attitude of the lical inhabitants is friendlier than elsewhere there should be little difficulty in achieving this* In addition to the security measures initiated by the Legation it is proposed to secure two Indian ex-service men for watch and ward and to hold arms for them. I understand that Minister agrees with me that Bushire should not be evacuated* 3. » • om - 2 - T&gt; r &gt; Jt a » I would 3. The reinforcement of Bushire requires conside informed the Government of India demi-officially that ~ ' — iha4drt&gt;e h^ld -v time permitted* This is, however, really a consideration for Mideast and Genstaff, but the reinforcement would have to be timed to take place in conjunction with any action in Khuzistan which is now under consideration by His Majesty*s Government* 4. * I fully appreciate the danger of any premature action at Bushire* 5. I understand that the Legation is preparing reserve means of warning us of coups* We should of course be in a very difficult position if communication with the Legation was £ut, and the obligation of prior consulation still existed* 6. Unless the war comes very close to us I hope to get up to Shiraz sooner or later, and even if I do not one officer at a time will probably get up for a change* If it is desired that Mr* Wiltshire should pay closer attention to Isfahan, which is a potential danger, this officer could help out the Indian pro- Consul at Shiraz* 7* I have informed Mr* Caroe and Mr,. Peel (India Office) demi- official ly that I am opposed to my predecessor^ proposals for the evacuation of Bushire, and have sent the gist of n^y letter to them, and to Mlddi Mideast by wire* I have also warned the Ambassador, Bagdad, that evacuation would mean the severance of his cable communication with England and India* 8. If Bushire is used for evacuating British subjects, it must be borne in mind that the slow mails may be taken for troop carrying, and an immediate departure cannot be guaranteed in fact a fast mail has Just been taken off the run* Flying-boats from Bahrain could however land in the Estury at all states of the tide and make the Journey in about one hour, but the difficulties with the Iranian Government would have to be taken into account* We have a secret method of telegraphic communication with Bahrain* 9. If the Imperial Bank of Iran suddenly suspended operations there may be difficulties in obtaining currency* I will, if instructed to do so, increase the cash balance in the Bushire Treasury * 10* Bandar Abbas is outside my Jurisdiction but it would be helpful if their plans could be correlated with ours* 11. I would be glad if the Minister could very kindly say whether he approves generally of my proposals, and in particular whether he agrees to ray initiating proposals for the defence of Bushire in any emergency with the Government of India and Mideast* I would of course keep them fully informed of all that transpires* 12* I need hardly say that all at Bushire will be only too pleased to do everything that lies within their power to assist the British evacuees from other parts of Persia* I 11th June 1940. (Sd) C.G. Prior* I agree entirely with all Colonel Prior’s proposals and much appreciate his offer of help. It might be invaluable to have Bushire as a safe point for evacuation* It is understood that no British force would be sent to Bushire unless we were at the same time occupying the oil areas - a point in which the decision of His Majesty’s Government is still awaited* . 11th June 1940* (Sd) R*tw Bullard*V' COPY OF TEIjSGRAM.

Khorraaishahr, Meshed, Shiraz and Tabriz. ifyr Circular telegram No. 15 Saving. There is no sign of deterioration in the situa tion. Among many uncertain faccors are whether Russia has any designs on Iran, attitude of Russia to the Germans and whether some particular stage of the war might be the signal for action. There are signs iMu that the Iranian Government are increasingly aware of German activities and have taken some steps to counteract them though these steps have not gone very far. 2. No steps are contemplated at present for the evacuation of women and children from Tehran. It would however be a wise precaution, in case a situation should arise where British subjects in some parts of the country might wish to leave, to keep handy identity card, passport and reserve of petrol, money and food. But requisitioning of transport by the authorities might complicate departure. 3. During the last war some British subjects who had to leave affixed to the door notice with consular seal saying property on premises British and this was often effective. Consul here is having suitable notices prepared for use if required. Consulates in the provinces might take similar precaution.
