It is agreed that, so long as the main line between IConia and Bagdad is not entirely completed, the concessionnaires may not open to traffic the parts ot the line from Bagdad to Busra which they may have constructed. During the period in which the sections between Bagdad and Busra are not open to traffic the concessionnaires shall refund to the Imperial Government, at the dates when the annual instalments fall due, the annuity of 11,000 fr. per kilometre for interest on and redemption of the bonds which the Imperial Government shall have issued to them for the said sections, and they shall not, of course, receive anything on account of working expenses; but these clauses do not in any way prejudice the other rights ot the concessionnaires on the line from Bagdad to Busra. The forfeiture of the concession for one or several sections of the railway shall not prejudice the rights of the concessionnaires as regards the remaining sections of the new lines, nor as regards the whole of the old lines. Article 30. The concessionnaires shall construct free of charge at the points selected^ by the Government the necessary premises for the offices of the Imperial Railway Commissioners and of the customs, postal, and police officials. The concessionnaires shall construct at important stations, after arrangement with the Ministry of Commerce and Public Works, two rooms with water-closet for the postal service. Article 31. The concessionnaires may instal at their own expense on the whole extent of the line telegraph poles and wires ; this line shall not be used for private correspondence which has no connection with the working of the railway. The Imperial Government reserve to themselves the right of control at all times by inspectors appointed by the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs of all telegraphic correspondence carried over the wires of the company. The Government shall be entitled to make use of the poles belonging to the railwayfor the erection of one or, if necessary, two telegraph wires, and the poles on the railway shall be erected so that they are capable of supporting these two additional wires, as well as those of the company. In case of need the Government shall have the right of erecting, at their own expense, other poles throughout the extent of the line or, in case of breakage or interruption of their lines, placing telegraphists in the stations for the transmission of important and urgent official telegrams on the telegraph lines of the railway, provided always that the railway service is not obstructed. Article 32. The concessionnaires shall be entitled to convey by their own means of transport and without paying any tax to the postal administration of the Empire correspondence and bags concerning exclusively the railway service; hut on condition that they shall submit them, according to rule, to the control of the officials of the postal administration.

Article 33. The Imperial Government undertake that the service of the line connecting Haidar-Pasha with Sirkedji and the bridge of Karakeui shall he carried on by the Mahsousse Administration, by means of three new boats, of an average service speed of at least 14 miles (of 1,855 metres) per hour. If within one year from the date of exchange of the present convention the Mahsousse Administration should not organise the service under the above-mentioned conditions, the concessionnaires shall have the right to carry passengers and goods between the two points, provided that they select the crews of these boats from retired officers and men of the Imperial fleet, or from cadets of the Imperial Naval School who are eligible for commissions. The boats of the concessionnaires shall carry on their service in the place and instead of those of the Mahsousse Company while being exclusively appropriated to the said transport service, and the concessionnaires shall pay yearly to that administration a sum equal to 5 per cent, of the gross receipts derived from the transport of passengers and goods carried on by them between the above-mentioned points. From the balance of the gross receipts there shall be deducted :— 1. Working expenses ; 2. An annuity of 8'30 per cent, of the initial capital appropriated to the acquisi tion of boats; after deduction of the said sums, the remainder shall be carried to the account of the gross receipts of the new guaranteed lines. The amount of initial capital shall he determined after the boats have been purchased. It is understood that if the gross receipts of one year do not allow of the above- mentioned expenses being met the company shall have no claim upon the Imperial Government. It may, however, make good the deficit from the receipts of the following years. The boats of the concessionnaires, being considered as a section of the Mahsousse, shall enjoy the same rights as the latter. Article 34. The concessionary company and the company about to he formed by it being Ottoman joint-stock companies, all disputes and diflerences which may arise, either between the Imperial Government and the concessionnaires or the company, or between the concessionnaires or the company and private persons, as a result of the execution or interpretation of the present convention and the specification attached thereto, shall he carried before the competent Ottoman courts. The new company, being Ottoman, must correspond with the State departments in the Turkish language, which is the official language of the Imperial Ottoman Government.45 Article 35. The Imperial Government guarantee to the concessionnaires an annuity of 11,000 fr. per kilometre constructed and worked, and also a contract sum of 4,500 fr. per annum for working expenses in respect of each kilometre worked. This annuity of 11,000 fr. shall be met by an Ottoman State loan hearing interest at 4 per cent., with a sinking fund of 0 , 087538 per cent., redeemable during the period of the concession. Consequently the concessionnaires will be entitled to a nominal sum of 269,110 fr. 65 c. of this State loan for each kilometre constructed and opened to traffic, and the concessionnaires shall be debarred from demanding other amounts on this head from the Imperial Ottoman Government. ^ The total nominal amount of Government bonds accruing to the concessionnaires by the terms of the foregoing arrangement shall be issued to them by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the signature of each special convention for each section; hut the con cessionnaires shall make good to the Imperial Ottoman Government the sums which the latter have paid during the period of construction for the service of the bonds issued to the concessionnaires, viz., till the date on which each section of^ the railway is provisionally accepted. These sums shall be placed by the concessionnaires in the hands of the Public Debt for the account of the Imperial Ottoman Government. The Imperial Government reserve the right of modifying at any moment the system of payment of the kilometric annuity of 11,000 fr. fixed in the first paragraph of the present article, after redemption of the bonds issued in respect of the said annuity. As soon as the growth of the traffic and receipts and the financial situation permit the issue by the concessionnaires themselves of bonds of their own to replace the Government bonds which have been issued to them by the Imperial Government, the concessionnaires shall come to an agreement with the Imperial Government for the purpose of carrying out this arrangement. For the first section of 200 kilom. beyond Konia the face value of the bonds to be issued by the Imperial Ottoman Government to the concessionnaires is fixed at 54,000,000 fr. But as soon as this section is finally accepted and the length of the completed line is fixed, the exact nominal value of the bonds accruing to the concession naires for that section shall be calculated at the rate of 269,110 fr. 65 c. per kilometre. Any surplus over this nominal amount shall be calculated at the issue price, plus interest at 4 per cent, accrued up to the date of payment, and the sum thus ascertained shall be paid in cash by the concessionnaires into the Imperial Treasury. The calculation shall be made at a minimum of 81J per cent. The Ottoman Anatolian Bailway Company guarantees to the Imperial Ottoman Government the construction of the aforesaid first section of 200 kilom. until the work on this section is completed. In the event of the Imperial Ottoman Government deeming it necessary, they may also require the Ottoman Anatolian Bailway Company to guarantee other sections, and the Ottoman Anatolian Bailway Company shall have the right so to do. The contract sum of 4,500 fr. per annum for working expenses in respect of each kilometre opened to traffic will be guaranteed to the concessionnaires by a special convention for each section simultaneously with the convention regulating the annuity of 11,000 fr. As regards the first section of 200 kilom. beyond Konia, the above-mentioned contract sum of 4,500 fr. per kilometre per annum is secured to the concessionnaires on the surplus of the guarantees already assigned to the lines of the Ottoman Anatolian Bailway Company. The service of the Government bonds which are to be issued for the aforesaid kilometric annuity of 11,000 fr. shall be secured on the special appropriations agreed on with the Imperial Government before work is begun on each section. The Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Bail way Company, on its park further pledges, irrevocably and inalienably, to the holders of the said bonds the line from Konia to the Persian Gulf and its branches with their rolling stock. Similarly, and for the same purpose, it assigns its share in the receipts from this line after payment of the working expenses, but the bondholders shall not be entitled to intervene in the administration of the company. The aforesaid share of the receipts, after deducting working expenses both the said share and the amount of expenses to be determined by the company s hooks shall be paid annually, if need be, by the company to the Administration of the Ottomaii Public Debt for the service of the bends. The Imperial Ottoman Government shall refund to the company any sums that the latter may have supplied under this head for the service46 of the bonds issued. The Imperial Ottoman Government further assign, irrevocably and inalienably, to the holders of the aforementioned Government bonds their share of the gross receipts of the said line. If the gross kilometric receipts of the line exceed 4,500 fr. hut do not exceed 10,000 fr., the surplus above 4,500 fr. shall belong entirely to the Government. If the gross kilometric receipts exceed 10,000 fr., the portion up to 10,000 fr. being always divided as stated above, 60 per cent, of the surplus over and above the 10,000 fr. shall pass to the Imperial Government, and 40 per cent, to the Company. It is agreed that if the gross kilometric receipts do not reach 4,500 fr. the sum required to make good the deficiency in this amount shall be paid to the concessionnaires by the Government at the same time as the annuity of 11,000 fr. from the special assignments to be agreed on between the Imperial Government and the concessionnaires before the fulfilment by the concessionnaires of the clauses of the present convention relative to each section. The above assignments shall be collected and paid through the agency of the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt. As regards the Government bonds to be issued for the construction of the different sections of the railway, the receipts accruing to the Imperial Government shall be pooled in such a manner that the amount available shall he assigned to the whole of the said bonds in proportion to the original nominal value of each issue. Immediately after the payment of the coupons and the sinking fund of the Government bonds issued, the surplus of the receipts accruing to the Imperial Ottoman Government shall be paid to the latter annually after the completion of the formalities provided for by article 40 of the present convention. Article 36. For the purpose of determining the average of the kilometric receipts of the new Bagdad lines, all the receipts from every portion of the new lines, together with the net receipts referred to in articles 23 and 33 of the present convention, shall be pooled as and when the new lines are opened to traffic. The average of the gross kilometric receipts thus obtained shall serve as the basis for ascertaining the total of the sums to be paid in accordance with article 35. Article 37. The concessionnaires undertake to carry out at their own expense all the improve ments on the old lines from Haidar-Pasha to Angora and Eskishehr to Konia required for the introduction of an express train service, but the expenditure involved shall not exceed a sum of 8,000,000 fr. In return for this expenditure and for the new extraordinary charges for working expenses involved in the introduction of the express train service, the Imperial Government assign to the concessionnaires— 1. An annuity of 350,000 fr. for thirty years for interest and sinking fund in respect of the capital sum of 8,000,000 fr. mentioned above. This annuity shall be paid from the commencement of the works of improvement. 2. An annuity of 350,000 fr. for the establishment of the express trains. This latter annuity shall not become payable till the main line reaches Aleppo. The annuities provided for in the present article shall be paid to the Ottoman Anatolian Railway Company out of the existing assignments for the guarantees of the old railway system and in the same manner as the latter.

ARTICLE 1 . The concessionnaires undertake to carry out, at their own expense, risk, and peril, and to complete, within the period fixed by the convention, all the work connected with the railway so that it shall be ready for use and open to traffic in all parts. Ait. 2 . The concessionnaires must, in conformity with article 3 of the convention submit to the Ministry of Public Works, indicated on a general plan to a scale of g-i-Tr’ the location of the railway, the sites of the stations, the passing-places, and sidings for loading and unloading. °[426] E 3 Attached to this plan shall be : a longitudinal profile following the central line of the railway, a certain number of type cross sections of the bed of the railway, a table of the rising and falling gradients, and drawings of the most important engineering w r orks. The longitudinal profile shall be drawn to a scale of 5 - ( fo(T horizontal and - 5^0 vertical, the levels of which shall be referred to the mean sea level as a datum-line ; below the profile thei'e shall be indicated, by means of three horizontal lines drawn for this purpose :— (a.) Distances of 1,000 metres each along the railway from its starting point; ( 6 .) The length and the rate of the gradients; (c.) The length of the tangents and the graduation of the curves of the line, showing the radius of each of these latter. The concessionnaires shall further submit a general plan to a scale of Tdoooo? an d a longitudinal profile drawn to a horizontal scale of toWoo anc ^ a vertical scale of yoVo* Art. 3. The works shall be carried out for a single line. Art. 4 . The width of the gauge inside to inside of the rails shall be from D435 metres to 1’455 metres. The sidewidths, i.e., the portions of the permanent way comprised on either side between the outer edge of the rail and the edge of the ballast at the top, shall be not less than 1 metre for a single line ; if there is a double line the intervening space shall be 2 metres wide. Art. 5 . The concessionnaires shall construct along the railway such ditches, gutters, and small banks as shall be deemed necessary for the drainage of the track and bor'row- pits, and the maintenance of the w r orks. The ballast shall have a thickness of 0-40 metre, and the sleepers shall be of metal. The formation width beneath the ballast shall be 5‘50 metres. This width may be reduced to 5 TO metres in the difficult portions of the line. It may even be reduced to 4'50 metres when the ballast walls rest on masonry or solid rock. Art. 6 . The tangents shall be connected by curves, the radius of which may not be less than 500 metres. A tangent of 100 metres must be inserted between two reverse curves. The curves must further be joined to the tangents by means of a parabolic curve, ■which must encroach on the straight portion for half its length. The length of tangent remaining between the commencement of the parabolic curves may then be reduced to 10 metres on condition that the radius of curvature is increased as much as possible. Art. 7. The normal maximum rate of the rise and fall of the gradients is fixed at 18 millim. per metre. The junctions of the gradients shall be effected by means of vertical curves of a radius of 1,000 metres. The gradients corresponding to curves of small radius must be reduced as much as possible. The concessionnaires shall have the right to propose such modifications as may appear to them useful to the provisions of this article and those of the article preceding it, i.e., a reduction of the radii of curvature to 300 metres, and an increase in the gradient to 25*8 per mil in those parts which present special difficulties. But such modifications can only take effect after they have been approved by the Imperial Government, and in so far as they do not prevent, in case of need, an average speed of 75 kilom. an hour, including stops, over the whole line. Art. 8 . There must be a sufficient number of passing-places and sidings for standing, loading, and unloading, and they shall be determined by the Government on the proposal of the concessionnaires. It is hereby provided that the average distance between the stations shall be about 20 kilom. The length of the passing-places shall not be less than 300 metres measured between the fouling-points. In grading the longitudinal profile care shall be taken to provide level stretches of sufficient length in places where new stations are likely to be subsequently built. Art. 9 . When the railway has to cross roads or tracks, the preservation of which is necessary for the communications of the country, subways, bridges, or level crossings shall be constructed according to the configuration of the ground. When the railway has to be carried over a road, the span of the viaduct shall be fixed by the Government, with due regard to local circumstances, on the proposal of the concessionnaires, and may vary from 3 to 10 metres. In the arched viaducts the headway below the keystone of the arch from the road54 level shall be at least 5 metres; in those that are constructed with horizontal girders or beams the headway to the girder or beam shall be at least 4'30 metres. The width between the parapets of the viaducts shall he at least 4'50 metres for a single line and 8 metres for a double line. When the railway has to pass under a road, the width between the parapets of the bridge which supports the road shall be fixed by the Government, with due regard to local circumstances, and shall vary from 3 to 10 metres, according to the importance of the road. The span of the bridge between the abutments shall be at least 4'50 metres for a single line, and at least 8 metres for a double line; the headway allowed between the outer rails and the keystone of the arch for the passage of trains shall be not less than 4'80 metres. In the case of roads being crossed on the level by the railway the rails must be laid without any projection or depression above or below the surface of these roads, so as not to interfere in any way with the passage of vehicles. Level crossings shall be provided with barriers only at those points where the necessity of protection as shown by the amount of traffic on the road is recognised by the Government. Should it become necessary during the construction of the railway to divert or alter the position or the profiles of already existing roads, the gradients on the modified parts must not in any case exceed the maximum grade on the old roads. The level crossings must, in the direction of the drainage, be joined to the roads by slopes the gradient of which must not exceed 0'2 per metre on a length of at least 10 metres. Art. 10 . The concessionnaires shall be bound, at their own expense, to restore and secure the drainage of all waters of which the courses have been blocked, obstructed, or modified by the works. The width of the waterways in accordance with standard practice in the case of the bridges that are to be constructed where the railway crosses rivers, canals, and watercourses of any description shall be fixed by the Ministry of Public Works on the proposal of the concessionnaires. Art. 11 . The concessionnaires shall employ in the execution of the work only materials of good quality acquired in the surrounding country, and shall follow standard practice in every respect, so as to ensure that both work and material are of perfectly solid construction. The bridges and culverts to be constructed over the watercourses or over the public and private roads, as well as the aqueducts, shall be built of stone and iron or steel; wood shall be used only in the foundations, the floors, and for the stringers to be placed under the rails. Metal bridges with a width of 10 metres and above shall, before they are passed, be tested in accordance with the programme which shall be submitted for the approval of the Ministry of Public Works at the same time as the designs of these works. Metal bridges shall be calculated in accordance with the last circular of the Ministry of Public Works, either of Prussia or France. Whatever the gradients the length of the steel rails shall be 12 metres and their weight shall be 37'240 kilog. per metre. The rails shall be laid on fifteen steel sleepers of 58*300 kilog. The rails shall be laid on plates on each sleeper. The rails, sleepers, &amp;c., shall be of the type adopted by the Prussian State railways. With regard to the arrangement and construction of the buildings, stations, and shelters, it is agreed that these shall not be more than are strictly necessary having regard to the convenience and ordinary customs of the country. The stations shall be built of stone or brick; they may have flat roofs, and stone, brick, or concrete flooring. I he slopes of the embankments, cuttings, and borrow-pits shall have a varying inclination determined by the nature of the ground. Such inclinations shall, at the instance of the concessionnaires, be determined during the progress of the work by the Ministry of Public Works or its delegates. Art. 12 . 1 lie concessionnaires shall attach to the general plan which is to be submitted a sketch indicating the nomenclature in detail, and the principal arrangements of passing-places and standing sidings, the level crossings, the bridges and aqueducts, the viaducts above and below the railway, and all the works which they propose to construct. r l he plans of the stations and the engineering works shall be drawn to a scale of jujj. Art. 13. In passing through towns and villages, and at the stations, the line shall, a[426] E 4 on Z*' if it is thought necessary, he separated by fencing from the contiguous properties and buildings. Art. 14. The plans that are to be submitted for the expropriation of the lands shall be drawn to a scale of -ginnj. Art. 15. As the work on the various sections proceeds, the concessionnaires shall have made at their own expense a joint delimitation and a cadastral survey of all the parts of the railway and everything appertaining thereto. They shall at the same time cause to be drawn up, at their own expense and in conjunction with representatives of the Government, a descriptive statement showing the bridges, aqueducts, and other engineering works that have been carried out; a certified copy, of the report of the delimitation, the cadastral survey, and the descriptive statement shall he deposited in the archives of the Ministry of Public Works. All the land expropriated after this general delimitation for supplementary work must be formally delimited as the expropriation proceeds, and this will be mentioned in the descriptive statement referred to above. Likewise all engineering works constructed after the submission of the descriptive statement to the Ministry of Public Works shall be noted thereon on their completion. Chapter II.— Maintenance and Working. Art. 16. The concessionnaires shall always maintain in good order the line and everything appertaining thereto, and the equipment and rolling sto°k, so that the movement of traffic throughout the whole is always easy and safe ; they will take constant care to avert any cause that might give rise to accidents. Should the concessionnaires give proof of negligence or cause delays in carrying out the present engagement, they shall receive a summons, and if within a period of one month from the date of the summons they have not complied therewith, the Imperial Government shall themselves take the necessary steps, at the cost of the concessionnaires, and shall proceed to carry out the necessary repairs ; the cost of this work shall be charged on the working expenses and on certain receipts accruing to the concessionnaires, and in case these are insufficient, the concessionnaires shall be bound to make good the deficiency. Art. 17. The concessionnaires shall draw up every month and submit to the Ministry of Public Works a statement showing the receipts of every kind from the railway and everything appertaining thereto. The statement showing the gross receipts shall indicate the gross receipts derived from the conveyance of passengers and goods as well as all other proceeds and receipts from the actual railway. The rates levied on military transports, which may be effected on credit, shall be embodied in a separate monthly account. The amount of them shall be carried to the gross receipts when collected. Chapter III.— Repurchase and Forfeiture of the Concession, and Formalities to he fulfilled on the Expiration of the Concession. Art. 18. In the event of the concession being declared to have been forfeited, under the terms of article 29 of the convention, provision shall be made^ for the fulfilment of the engagements entered into by the concessionnaires by means of tenders after a valuation of the works already constructed, the plant, fixtures, and rolling stock belonging to them, and in fine of all the materials and land purchased by them; the highest tenderer shall thereupon undertake the fulfilment of all the engagements incumbent on the dispossessed concessionnaires. The dispossessed concessionnaires shall receive from the new concessionnaires the value fixed by the assessment of the aforesaid plant, after, however, deduction of the costs. Any surplus shall be paid over, for the account of the Imperial Government, to the Administration of the Public Debt, to be appropriated for the sinking fund and interest on the Government bonds issued for the forfeited section. If the above- mentioned tender lead to no result, tenders shall again be invited after a lapse of six months, and with a suitable reduction in the price ; and if this second attempt equally leads to no result, the concessionnaires shall definitely forfeit their rights under the present convention, and the objects put up to auction shall become, without any payment, the property of the State. Any security deposited and not yet restored shall revert to the Government. Art. 19. In the event of the withdrawal of the concession for the railway by the Imperial Government under article 19 of the convention, the equipment and rolling stock, such as locomotives, carriages, and waggons, used in the working of the line shall be■■M 5G surrendered free of charge to the Imperial Government. All stores and fuel and all furniture used in the working of the line and existing at the time of the withdrawal of the concession shall be purchased, on expert valuation, by the Imperial Government. Art. 20 . On the expiration of the period of the concession for each section the concessionnaires shall deliver, free of charge, and in good condition and free of all debt and liability to the Imperial Government, the stations and sidings for loading and unloading, as well as the buildings used in the working of the line, such as sheds and houses for the officials engaged in controlling, inspecting, and collecting, the fixed machinery, and in general all stationary stock not used in transport. The equipment and rolling stock, such as engines, carriages, and waggons, used for the working of the line, shall be surrendered free of charge to the Imperial Government. The materials used in construction and for repairs, fuel, stores, and all the movable appliances used in the working of the line and in existence at the moment of the termination of the concession shall he purchased, on expert valuation, by the Imperial Government. Notwithstanding, the Imperial Government shall be hound to take only such stores as are required for the working of the line during six months. In the event of the Imperial Government ascertaining five years before the expira tion of the concession that the railway is not being maintained in good repair, a summons shall be issued to the concessionnaires, and a certain time shall be allowed to them to put the line in good repair. If this summons leads to no result, the Government shall undertake the working of the line and everything appertaining thereto and shall them selves carry out, at the expense of the concessionnaires, the repairs necessary to put the line in a good condition. The costs of repair shall he charged on the working expenses and certain receipts accruing to the concessionnaires; should the receipts prove insufficient, the concessionnaires shall be hound to make good the deficiency.

A ♦69 The aforesaid share of the receipts, after deduction of working expenses—both the said share and the amount of working expenses to be determined by the company’s books—shall be remitted, if need be, by the latter annually to the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt for the service of the loan, after the balance-sheet of each financial year has been approved by a general meeting. If the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt has failed to notify to the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company at the latest by the day each year preceding the ordinary general meeting of the said company, the necessity of applying this appropriation to the service of the loan, the company is authorised to dispose freely of the share of the receipts in question. The Imperial Ottoman Government shall be bound to refund to the company any sums which the latter may have supplied on this head for the service of the State loan. Art. 11 . The Deutsche Bank shall be entrusted with the service of the interest and sinking fund of the second or third series of the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway 4 per Cent. Loan irrevocably and throughout its duration. The Imperial Ottoman Government allocate to the Deutsche Bank ^ per cent, on the sums paid either through it or through the banking houses which it shall name for the service of the interest and sinking fund of both series of the present loan. For the service of the loan in Paris, the Imperial Ottoman Bank is already hereby designated, the designation of other financial houses besides the latter being reserved. Art. 12 . The Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt shall deduct from the Government’s share in the surplus specified in article 9 of the present contract:—• 1 . The sums required for the service of the interest and sinking fund of the second and third series of the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway 4 per Cent. Loan, including the differences of exchange which may arise from the payment of coupons and redeemed bonds effected abroad in francs, marks, pounds sterling, and Dutch florins, which shall be transmitted by the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt to the Deutsche Bank on a simple notification from the latter. 2 . The charges for advertisement (article 2 ), commission (article 11 ), together with the lesser expenses connected with the forwarding of coupons, drawn bonds, &amp;c. On the other hand, it is expressly agreed that the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt shall not be entitled to any commission on the sums which it shall receive for the service of the loan from the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company in accordance with the terms of articles 9 and 10 of the present contract. Art. 13. The funds required for the service of the interest and sinking fund in respect of the bonds of the present loan shall be deposited by the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt at the Deutsche Bank, in such a way that the whole amount of the aforesaid sums shall be in the hands of the Deutsche Bank not later than four weeks at least before the payment of the coupons and the repayment of the redeemed bonds fall due respectively. The Deutsche Bank shall convert each remittance into marks within three days to the best interests of the Imperial Ottoman Exchequer, and shall place the amount in a special account to the credit of the Imperial Ottoman Government with interest at 1 per cent, below the official rate of discount of the Imperial German Bank. This interest shall accrue to the profit of the Imperial Ottoman Government from the date of each payment made to the Deutsche Bank till two weeks before the half- yearly maturity to which these payments are to be applied. The account mentioned above shall be settled between the Deutsche Bank and the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt on the 2 nd January and the 1 st July of each year. Art. 14. Both series of the present loan and all the deeds relating to the present contract and its execution, together with the bonds and coupons of both series of this loan, are exempt from all stamp duties, rates, or dues in Turkey both now and in the future. The Imperial Ottoman Government pledge themselves not to make any deduction or reduction in the payment of the coupons and the redemption of the bonds. The charges for stamps abroad on the bonds of the present loan shall be borne by the Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company. Art. 15. The Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Company shall be responsible for the quotation of the shares of both series of the present loan on the European exchanges which the Deutsche Bank shall indicate, and shall defray the incidental expenses, and the Imperial Ottoman Government shall lend its good offices for this purpose through its embassies. [426] F 370 The Minister of Finance and the President of the Council of Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt shall sign the prospectuses and declarations required in the issue of both series of the present loan. Art. 16. The Imperial Ottoman Government reserve the right of withdrawing at any time from circulation the bonds of the loan which form the subject of the present convention by redeeming them at par after a previous public notice of at least two months. The Imperial Ottoman Government similarly reserve the right of proceeding at any time and for the benefit of the Imperial Ottoman Government to a conversion of both series of the said loan by means of repayment in cash at par of the bonds of this loan still in circulation and the substitution for them of other bonds bearing a lower rate of interest. Art. 17. Any controversy that may arise out of the interpretation or execution of the present contract shall be settled by arbitration. Each of the parties concerned in the controversy shall appoint an arbitrator within one month. In the event of disagreement between the arbitrators, the latter shall appoint an umpire, whose decision shall be final and binding on all the contracting parties.

Additional Convention in continuation of the Bagdad Dailway Convention of February 20, 1318 (March 5, 1903) for the Construction of the Bagdad Line, from the Station of Bulgurlu to the place called El Helif, near Mar dm, and of a branch line from Tei-IIabesh to Aleppo. THE Imperial Government have decided to extend the Bagdad line from Bulgurlu as far as the place called El Helif, in the neighbourhood of Mardin, and to build a branch line from Tel-Habesh to Aleppo. The length of this line and of the branch line is about 840 kilom. The surplus of the revenues ceded to the Public Debt having been assigned to the extension of the Bagdad line, the guarantee for these 840 kilom. of line shall be paid out of the surplus of the revenues ceded to the Public Debt, at the rate of 11,000 fr. per kilometre, in accordance with article 35 of the Bagdad Convention. It being understood that if the surplus in question is not sufficient for the guarantee of these 840 kilom. any deficiency that may be found to exist at the end of the year shall be made good by the first receipts from the aghnams of the vilayets of Konia and Adana belonging to the following year, as well as from the first receipts from the aghnams of the vilayets of Aleppo, after deduction of the portion appropriated to the payment of the war indemnity. As regards the working expenses, they shall be secured in the first place by the gross receipts from these 840 kilom., it being understood that should the gross receipts from this line be less than 4,500 fr. per kilometre, the figure specified in article 35 of the Bagdad Convention, any difference that may be found to exist at the end of the year shall he also made up out of the surplus revenues ceded to the Public Debt which have been appropriated to the guarantee of the line, should this surplus he sufficient; and in the contrary event the difference shall, in the same way as a deficiency in the security, &gt;be made good out of the first receipts from the aghnams of the three vilayets in question of the following year. Although, according to the provisions of article 3 of the convention of the 20 th February, 1318 (5th March, 1903), the plans and designs of the sections to be built must be submitted to the Ministry, of Commerce and Public Works within eight months from the date at which the period of the concession for each section commences, after the provisions of article 35 relating to the said section have been fulfilled, and although the plans and designs in question must be examined and approved by the aforesaid Ministry within three months from the date of their submission, since it would not be possible to pomplete the survey within the eight months provided for by article 3, it has been decided that the plans and designs of the part of the line between Bulgurlu- Tel Habesh and Aleppo shall be submitted to the Ministry of Commerce and Public Works within one year from the date of the exchange of the present additional convention; that the plans and designs of the portion of the line between Tel-Habesh and El Helif shall be submitted within three years from the same date; that the time within which the approval of the plans and designs by the aforesaid Ministry must be given shall be four months ; and that the construction of these 840 kilom. of line shall be completed within eight years from the date of the exchange of the present additional convention. The service of the bonds to be issued in accordance with article 35 of the Bagdad Railway Convention for the construction of the 840 kilom. of line mentioned above shall be settled by a special convention simultaneously with the present additional convention.

The Anatolian and Baghdad Railways have published their financial reports for 1911, The receipts of the formal amounted to 15,100,271 francs (as against 11,497,99 9 francs in 1910), representing 17,103 francs per kilometre on the main Haidar-Pasha-Konia line and 11,360 francs and 17,353 francs on the branch lines Eski-Sbehir-Konia and Arifieh-Ada-Bazar respectively. The number of passengers was L',709,276 on the main and 212,535 and 124,144 on the two branch lines respectively. The goods carried amounted to 425,027 tons on the main and 216,509 tons and 41,611 tons on the •two branch lines respectively. The working expenses were 6,202,444 francs, leavinga net revenue of 8,621 francs per kilometre, The receipts on the main line exceeded for the first time the amount of the kilometric guarantee, sothat the Governmeat had no prepayment to make and even received as its share the sum of 352,467 francs. As against this the Gov ernment had to pay 1,045,235 francs on the Eski-Shehir-Konia branch line. The report points out that the section Bulgurlu-Ulukishla has been working since the 1st June, 1911, and that from Dorak to the foot of Amanus Mountains was opened on the 27th April last. On the 4th January of the present year the company obtained a concession for a railway, GO kilometres long, from Ada-Bazar in the direction of Bolu for a period of 90 years. The company contemplates the raising of a loan of 60 million francs at 4| per cent, foradditioni? -work on the existing main and branch lines. The total available surplus amounted to 3,630,004 francs, of which 2 940,160 francs were distributed in dividends of 5 per cent. The total paid-up capital amounts to 58,803.200 francs. The Baghdad Rail way has now a length of 237 , 6 kilometres. The net receipts amounted to 3,370 francs per kilometre—a total of 740,603 francs (as against 514,235 francs the previous year); 95 884 passengers and 30,016 tons of goods were carried during the year. The Ottoman Gcrernrnent had to pay iu kilometric guarantee 238,166 francs (as again U 331,115 francs in 1910). It is expected that during the present year 100 to 150 kilometre will be opened, from Aleppo towards the Amanus on the one hah’ and towards the Euph - rates on the other. It is also intended shortly to begin work from Baghdad north vards, and on a branch line to Aiexandretta, to be com pleted in 1913. To cover the cost of construc tion of the line to Alexand retta the remaining 50 per cent cn the shares, amounting to 15 million francs, will de called up. The year’s operation showa net profit of 798,324 francs, and 53i;240 was distributed in dividend at 5 per cent. According to Reuter’s Berlin correspondent a telegram from Constantinople states that as the Ministry of Tu 1 lie Works has finally approved the plans for the Mediterranean port of the Baghdad Railway ^t Alexandretta and the branch line from Toprak Kale to Alexand retta work was begun at Alexandretta on the 10th June.MEN AND WOMEN OF TO-DAY 483 £h, j'Vw^ it pel flir' nr&gt;nr tf s' llAry /TvL^. ^ /W 7 I^UtATtL (fl3 For Mrs. Bedford Fenwick to-day seems still far from being anything near the age she must be ; her young-looking face, her pleasant speech, her constant activity, her unceasing regard and con sideration for every person showing a deep interest in nursing, her willingness to undertake labours from which a young and strong nurse of thirty might well Nursing, and there is hardly a magazine or journal in the land dealing with this topic, so interesting to women and the medical fraternity, which has not pub lished valuable articles on some part of nursing work from the pen of Mrs. Fenwick.

SHEPSTONE Illustrated ivith photographs specially taken by the American Colony, -Jerusalem T HE Bagdad Railway line, now successfully laid from Aleppo eastwards to the Euphrates Valley, will link not [only Meso potamia with Europe by an iron road, but Syria and Palestine and the sacred cities of their hills and plains. If, and when, peace comes to the troubled Turk we are apt again to hear a great deal about this most political railway line in existence. For in its making are built the century distant hopes and plans of great peoples. So far the progress of the Balkan War and the decline of the Ottoman Empire have not interfered with the actual work of construction. But in the near future there will have to be a complete recasting of the agreements by which the building of the road is to be financed. It has gone so far now that some way must be found to carry on the work. Aleppo, in Northern Syria, has been converted into a great railway centre. It is now the main base of operations, where huge quantities of railway material have been collected. Locomotive works and repair shops have been built as well as large temporary barracks for the workers. On what is known as the Aleppo section there are now five hospitals with ten doctors and many nurses who tend, free of charge, all cases of accident and sickness among the workers. This activity is extraordinary when it is remembered that from October 1904 until the latter part of 1909 not a yard of metals was laid, or a spade put into the ground. The reasons for this long delay were many, and to grasp them fully, as well as to understand the political significance of the enterprise, it is necessary to review briefly the history of this notable venture. The idea of a railway to Bagdad is very old. Sir William Andrew, an Indian railway official of renown, is said to have been the first seriously to suggest such a scheme, and as far back as 1857 Sir John Macneill and General Chesney re ported favourably upon it, while in 1872 a Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to examine the question. Then the idea was to run a railway from some port on the Syrian coast, Alexandretta b -ing the point suggested, to Bagdad, and thence to Persia towards India. The late Sultan, Abdul Hamid, who at that time showed more than an ordinary friendship toward Great Britain, was disposed to sanction the scheme, but the matter was shelved, presumably be cause no financiers could be found to back it. Our occupation of Egypt, to gether with the Government purchase of the Khedive shares giving us a practical interest in the management of the Suez Canal and other matters, somewhat upset our position at the Porte. Germany saw her opportunity and grasped it, so that for some years the Kaiser became virtually the guardian of the Sick Man of Europe. Germany showed her hand promptly by building the Anatolian Railway, which runs from Scutari, the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople, to Konia. But in 1902 she literally dropped a bombshell into the political world by announcing the concession she had obtained from the Turkish Government to build a railway from Konia to the Persian Gulf, a distance of 1460 miles, or 1870 miles from Con-D RAILWAY ,EY REACHED — SAFE- [DERTAKING—LINKING EUROPE BY RAIL —A E—RAILWAY TRIPS TO ED GARDEN OF EDEN TONE \erican Colony, Jerusalem of the enterprise, it is necessary briefly the history of this iture. . of a railway to Bagdad is Sir William Andrew, an Indian cial of renown, is said to have urst seriously to suggest such and as far back as 1857 Sir Leill and General Chesney re- mrably upon it, while in 1872 Committee of the House of vas appointed to examine the i idea was to run a railway port on the Syrian coast, ta bAug the point suggested, and thence to Persia towards e late Sultan, Abdul Hamid, t time showed more than an endship toward Great Britain, :d to sanction the scheme, but was shelved, presumably be- inanciers could be found to )ur occupation of Egypt, to- the Government purchase of e shares giving us a practical the management of the Suez )ther matters, somewhat upset 1 at the Porte.

Eight years were set aside for the work which, it was estimated, would involve an expenditure of about £20,000,000. Great Britain did not regard the enter prise at all favourably, more particularly as the ultimate object of the line was to tap the Persian Gulf. This attitude was natural seeing that 88 per cent, of the trade in this region is in British hands. Our argument was that we had spent blood and treasure freely in opening the Gulf to trade, and that the mainten ance of British supremacy here was an integral part of our Asiatic policy. Again, the British Government recognised that the Germans had bested the Turk; who was to supply the money while the Germans were to build the railway with German material under German en gineers. This certainly was very different to the British proposal to construct a railway with British capital from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf with out guarantees from the Turkish Govern ment. The Start A practical start was made in i 9 0 3 - The Turkish Government handed a loan of £1,868,000 to the syndicate for the completion of the first section of the road. Of this sum only £600,000 went into the railway ; the balance—£1,268,000 was clear profit. This section runs over a dead level plain and crosses only one small river. So construction was as low as it possibly could have been. Section two, however, traverses the Taurus Mountains and it was discovered, after reconnaissance, that £3,000,000 would be needed to carry the rails over this barrier. Germany not only asked for this sum, but sufficient to enable her to build more than one section at a time. Turkey retorted that the agreement was to finish one section at a time. She was willing to finance number two, but thought the heavy balance over on the first section should go towards it. This huge profit, however, appears to have been distri buted among the shareholders of the syn dicate and various other officials who did not fail in true Teutonic manner to claim baksheesh.” Then came dissensions in the Ottoman XXI BAGDAD RAILWAY 489 Empire—a rebellion in the Yamen,^ re volution, the rise of the Young lurk Party, and the overthrow of Abdul Hamid—with the result that work upon the undertaking was dropped. But after some six years’ delay, Germany got her way, receiving loans or guarantees amount ing to no less than £7&gt;5 00 &gt;. 000 bespread over several sections, while England was satisfied provisionally by an arrangement whereby the line from Bagdad to the Gulf was to be built by an English company, and to be purely international in character. So much for history ; now for work done. The enterprise may be divided into four sections: (1) extending from Konia to Adana ; (2) from Adana to Aleppo ; (3) from Aleppo to Mosul on the Tigris, and (4) from Mosul to Bagdad. As already explained, an English company will carry the rails from this last point to the Gulf. The line has been opened to traffic from Konia to Ulukishlar at the foot of the Taurus Mountains. Lift ing the track over this barrier and dropping it again into the Cicilian Plains is proving an exacting task. But it should be overcome within the next eighteen months or two years. No less than thirty-five costly bridges and via ducts of varying sizes have been found requisite to consummate this mountain section. Meanwhile, the rails are being laid rapidly from Adana westwards toward the Cicilian Plains as well as east wards in the direction of Aleppo. For some months past railway material for this section of the undertaking has been sent up over the short line from Mersina, a small port on the Mediterranean, to Adana. This railway was built some years ago by the French; but was pur chased subsequently by the Germans. The Sea Terminus From Aleppo, the base of operations, the builders have pushed eastwards toward the Euphrates, and thence north to Osmaniyeh, on the way to Adana. The activity at Aleppo is remarkable. A few years ago it was a sleepy old-world Syrian city ; to-day all is bustle and activity. Building material is being brought over the French railway from Tripoli, a train of twenty to twenty-five cars of railway material arriving at 2P2Aleppo daily. This station is not on the main line ; Moselmieh, a little to the north, will be the junction of this great system of Asiatic railways. All trains will go to Aleppo, however, over the short branch line connecting it with the junc tion. A temporary wooded bridge has been thrown across the Euphrates, which is nearly a mile wide in the flood season, for construction purposes, to be replaced by a permanent handsome structure of steel. because Great Britain has interfered, which is the more probable. No doubt we object to the Germans establishing themselves on the Mediterranean ; in any case the harbour work bids fair to hang fire until a satisfactory understanding with Great Britain is effected. Alexandretta is in a marshy locality ; suffers from fever; and extensive sanitation is re quired to render the place healthy. Just south of Osmaniyeh run the Amanus ‘Stnyrn* SYRIAN DLSERT WHERE THE BAGDAD RAILWAY WILL RUN It] is intended that Alexandretta shall be the Syrian port of the Bagdad railway, and a pier has already been constructed. It is proposed to run the rails from this port to Osmaniyeh on the main line. The merchants at Aleppo, however, are endeavouring to induce the Germans to run the line from Alexandretta to Aleppo direct. The Germans were to build a harbour at Alexandretta, and a large quantity of material was assembled here for this purpose. All work now has ceased so far as the harbour is concerned. Why ? Local rumour advances vary ing reasons. Some declare it is for the want of funds, which seems scarcely creditable as money is being spent freely on the main lines. Others say it is Mountains, and here an army of men has commenced the boring of a six-mile tunnel, to carry the track through this ridge. The greater part of the material— rails, sleepers, ties, stone and ironwork for the bridges, locomotives and rolling stock, are being supplied by German manufacturers. None but Germans need apply for orders. The passenger-cars are to be of the American type and include sleeping and dining coaches. Naturally, the principal engineers are Germans, but thousands of Greeks and Armenians are to be found among the navvies and also Turks before most of them were drafted for the war.

Naturally, engineers are Germans, but Greeks and Armenians are to ig the navvies and also Turks f them were drafted for the 2 road from Scutari to doubtful whether through BUILDING THE BAGDAD RAILWAY communication will be possible within the next two years. Everything depends upon the success of the engineers in the Taurus Mountains. When the connection is made, the Bagdad Railway will at once jump into prominence as affording railway communication between Europe and the sacred cities of Palestine and the old Bible cities of Mesopotamia. Because the Turkish Government has advanced the lines from Damascus to Aleppo. Then from Damascus railway connection will be made with Nazareth and Haifa, and as it is intended to connect Jerusalem with this system, the Holy City will be in railway touch with Damascus and Aleppo in the far north. This means that one will be able to journey by rail from the great centres of Europe to Con stantinople and thence on to the sacred cities of the Holy Land. Treading Historic Ground No railway traverses such historical and interesting ground. Leaving Scutari (Constantinople) the line skirts the shores of the Sea of Marmora for some distance and then strikes inland, across a thickly populated and well cultivated plain, to Konia. For hundreds of miles through Asia Minor the railway track traverses one of the most ancient highways in the world—the grand route between the Orient and Europe. Xenophon travelled it with Cyrus ; as also did Alexander and St. Paul. Hittites, Assyrians, and Greeks have followed it ; Romans, Byzantines, Persians, Mongols, Crusaders, Ertoogrul, the founder of the Turkish Empire, and a long train of conquerors, down to Ebraham Pasha of half a century ago, have passed and repassed with their mighty armies, their captives, and their spoils. On the eastern side of the Taurus Mountains is Tarsus, the birthplace of St. Paul, and even to-day no mean city. Though washed once by the sea it is now several miles inland. It is the centre of a busy cotton-growing country, and only modern methods and machinery are needed to turn this vast district into wealth untold. On the outskirts of the plains exist vast deposits of coal, iron, copper, lead, chrome, &amp;c., all undeveloped as yet. Applications for concessions to work them have been made but so far 49 1 have been refused. Indeed, the back wardness of the Turk in developing his territory is noticeable everywhere. There are few districts where the soil is so fertile as in some parts of Asia Minor, but it is merely scratched, vast stretches of rolling plains being given over to the feeding of a few scattered flocks. The Turkish Government has endeavoured to populate the districts by emigration, but have sadly failed. Promises to emigrants are never carried out ; when a settler demands the official fulfilment of the contract he is buffeted from pillar to post. No redress whatever is possible under the present lax government. Some of the cities tapped by the railway are of immense size with large populations, and it is notable that German representatives are establishing them selves here in order to catch the trade when the railway is opened, and the country develops. It is evident that machinery of all descriptions will be needed for agricultural and other pur poses. The British manufacturer should find a good opening for his wares, par ticularly threshing machines, steam- ploughs, reaping machines, pumps large and small, steam- and gas-engines, not to mention ginning machines for cotton, spindles and weaving-looms. Generally speaking, British machinery is preferred ; the British manufacturer should hasten to nurse the market which otherwise he will miss probably in this part of the world. In the great cities of Aleppo; Hama, and Horns the Germans are carry ing the trade for the simple reason that they are already on the spot. Between Aleppo and Mosul the country is wild, barren, and thinly populated; The latter point is built on ground that once was a suburb of Nineveh. From the city one can see the huge mounds— the remnants of the glories of the capital of ancient Assyria. The remains of the city are still to be seen, and it is stated that an enterprising German is building a hotel close, in the anticipation that many people will travel by the Bagdad Railway to see them. Here, too, is a. tomb, said to mark the burial-place of Jonah. Until now Mosul has been one of the most inaccessible places in the Ottoman Empire.492 Thence the railway follows the left bank of the Tigris to Bagdad, a distance of some four hundred miles; the fabled site of the Garden of Eden—now a rolling desert. his and sea of sand is to be reclaimed and made fertile once again. That the soil is exceedingly rich there is no deny- ing. Sir William Willcocks surveyed this region on behalf of the Turkish Govern ment, and declares that it is possible to reclaim no less than 2,800,000 acres of land at a cost of £21,000,000, which would be worth £60,000,000. Archaeological Treasures Not far from Bagdad lie the ruins of ancient Babylon, where, for some time past, a band of enthusiastic archaeologists under the German Oriental Society, have' been excavating. A large area of the city has been laid bare already. Wide paved streets have been cleared, private houses uncovered and explored, while an expert architect has traced the walls of the city a long distance and has prepared drawings to show just how Babylon once looked. But the greatest of all has been the complete excavation of the vast palace of King Nebuchadnezzar. This enormous building has a frontage of 1200 ft. and is 1500 ft. deep. Here was discovered a stone lion of enormous size Too heavy to remove, it has been mounted on a pedestal built of bricks taken from the palace walls. Beneath the lion’s body is a prostrate human figure, which ttie lion seems about to devour. In a chamber was found a splendid bas-relief m dolente of Nebuchadnezzar himself His robe, sandals, and quaint kinky beard* worn in tight curls, which we always associate with pictures of old Assyrian and Babyion kings, are all carved with much skill and great attention to detail Among the “ finds ' is a stone goo^e, hewn from some hard black rock and polished like onyx. From the inscription it is clear that this goose was a measure of standard weight. Many tablets also have been found which tell of the wonder ful civilisation which flourished in Chaldea thousands of years ago. They tell of ie habits of daily life, marriage and social customs, conditions of trade and forms of industries which prevailed long before the dawn of the Christian era At present scarcely a dozen Europeans visit the ruins in the course of a year But when the railway comes along a this may be altered ; the archaeologist, m near future may have to mounl guard over their stone lion and lock up theii goose and tablets from the souvenir hunter When the Gulf itself will be reached it is impossible to say ; and certainly not wise to prophesy. The Germans, accord ing to the latest arrangements, cannot go farther than Bagdad, and it is generally understood that Great Britain will not push the railway further south until the country here is settled. Will the Railway Pay? Will the Bagdad railway pay ? Those who tramped over the proposed route during the building of the first section some few years ago now, emphatically declared it could not; at least not for many years to come. But things are rapidly changing, not only in Asia Minor, but in Syria and Mesopotamia. Modern methods are being introduced, and there is no greater developing agency to-day than a railway to bring to the front the nidden natural resources of the country. Palestine is one of the richest touring grounds in the world to-day. Hitherto it has been accessible only by steamer, ihere is an ever flowing stream of pilgrims to and from its sacred cities ! Hordes of pilgrims visit it yearly from Kussia. They come down to Constanti- nople and travel thence by steamer to Jana. They would much prefer the railway journey from Scutari. It would e quicker and safer. The better-class tourists visiting Syria and the Holy ■Land irom the eastern countries of Europe would also prefer the overland route. 11 ^ ^ mus ^ ^e remembered above all thmgs that the Bagdad railway is a political railway; a vehicle to carry German influence into the East. Only the buoyant enthusiasts ever think that tins railway will earn sufficient revenue from the country traversed to pay for the axle-grease, so long as the Turk nesitates to turn his sleeves up and follow honest Governments. The Bagdad line offers a short cut to India and beyond; where Germany aspires to do business, and to become recognised as a Great ower. It is but another manifestation ot Germany s commercial ambitions.D RAILWAY e ruins in the course of a year ten the railway comes alone all Y be altered; the archeologists near future may have to mount /er their stone lion and lock up their ld tablets from the souvenir hunter the Culf itself will be reached tossible to say ; and certainly not prophesy.

THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY AND PERSIAN GULF AGREEMENT. The accompanying map covers tlie chief portion of the region immediately affected by the impending agreement between Great Britain and Turkey. In regard to the Persian Gulf, it is now considered certain that the agreement will provide: (1) for the recognition by Great Britain of the suzerainty of the Porte over Koweit, which is to be an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire; (2) for an undertaking on the part of the Porte not to interfere in the internal affairs of Koweit or in the question of succession and for the recognition of the conventions concluded between the Sheikh of Koweit and the British Government; (3) for the abandonment by the Porte of all its pretensions to suzerainty over the peninsula of El Katr, the Bahrein j Arab difficulty will be found in the establishment of an Ottoman Commission, with strong British participation, to exercise independently all the functions of a naviga tion and port authority. The heads of both the inspec tion and engineer branches would in this case have to be British. In this connection we would again direct attention to the condition of the Tigris river, which calls for con servancy measures in the interests of the Turkish and British steamers using its waters. As Sir William Willcocks has pointed out, by an expenditure of a rela tively small amount upon the construction of three regu lators the wastage of water that now takes place could be checked, and a channel of sufficient depth for naviga tion by the shallow-draught boats now employed should be made available at all seasons of the year. An agreement regarding the contemplated extension of the Baghdad Railway towards the Persian Gulf does THE BAGHDAD-PERSIAN GULF REGION. Islands, Muscat, and the territory of the trucial chiefs ; (4) for the recognition by the Porte of the right of Great Britain to undertake the duty of lighting, buoy ing, and policing the Gulf. . . Other outstanding matters between Great Britain and Turkey in these regions concern the navigation of the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the Shatt-el-Arab, and the frontier between Turkey and Persia. On the Tigris and Euphrates Great Britain enjoys certain rights and privileges, which in any permanent understanding with the Porte require to be defined and acknowledged. On the Shatt-el-Arab the question of navigation involves additional duties, including dredging, buoying, light ing, and policing, which, in the absence of any attempt on 3 Turkey’s part to carry them out, have had to be per formed by Great Britain in the interests of British trade, which is paramount in these waters. According to the forecast given by the Times of the agreements with Turkey, it is probable that a solution of the Shatt-el- not imply that the scheme will necessarily be carried out in the near future. The British Government, however, rightly insists on a clear understanding regard ing the project, with a view to safeguarding British interests in the Middle East. The preponderance of British trade requires that the control of such a rail way should not pass into hostile hands. Of the various schemes proposed in order to make provision for the “ open door ” in the letter and in the spirit on this line the one that appears to have been finally selected is that Great Britain should be represented on the Board of the Baghdad Railway. The terminus will naturally be at Busreh. The proposal that the line should be continued to Koweit (as indicated on the map) coula never be entertained by Great Britain. If in the fulness of time Koweit requires to be connected by railway with Busreh the question is one for Great Britain and Turkey to decide, and not the Baghdad Railway Administra tion.72 FKE NEAR EAST.

Indeed, for the first time the railway as a whole has not been required to call upon the Turkish Government to provide kilo- metric guarantees, and has instead handed over to Turkey 25 per cent, of the excess of the returns above the guarantee. Despite the fact that during the whole of October the line was used exclusively for military 1 purposes, the gross receipts rose to i 8 , 840 ,ooof (i 5 ,ioo,ooof a year ago). After the subtraction of working and extraordinary expenses, and the share of I the Turkish Government ( 992 , 166 ^, the net receipts re mained at io,i 62 , 648 f, as compared with 8 , 196 , 595 f a year ago, allowing a rise of \ per cent, in interest to 5 ^ per cent., and an increase in carry-forward from 38 i,ooof to 6 n,ooof. The Bagdad Railway paid an interest of 5 per cent., the same as last year. 1 he length of the Bagdad Railway now being worked is given at 609 kilometres, as compared with 238 a year ago; that of the Anatolian Company remains un changed at 1,032 kilometres. Over the prospects of Turkey’s economic progress in Asia Minor the report is very optimistic. The development, it suggests, will be now even more rapid, since the whole interest of the Government will be concentrated on the Asiatic provinces. The harvest prospects, it sa\s, are quite favourable, despite the lack of labour.— ■ &amp; COPY (original in File XXIl/lO ).

The Baghdad Railway Company would prefer to build and manage the section from Baghdad to Basrah themselves rather than abandon that section to another com} any. The company did not, under the arrangement of 1911, definitely aahandon their rights to do this; they at that time merely made a declaration of their readiness to do so subject to two conditioi* , viz:- that the Baghdad ^ail^ay Company’s ±n- - terest in the new company should be equal to that of any nation other than Tur ey , and that the Baghdad Railway Com- -pany should receive compensation fo r the renunciation of righ s secured to them under hhe original concession. 2.

If, however, for some technical reasons , such as arrangement cannot be made as regards building material etc, then the German Government would undertake that German subjects shall no participate in any navigation company on ^he two rivers after, say,five years from 1913. 4.

A Draft Convention with Turkey has teen initialled | ad referendum according to which we waive our claim to partial- | -pate in construction of the railway line up to tasrah, on condi- j -tion that without our consent the line does not proceed teyond i Dasrah, and also on condition that two British Directors are on Board of the Baghdad Railway Company from Urmia to the terminus. The latter condition has teen added in order to insure against estat1ishment of differential rates. Germany has asked that her , delegates at the Financial Commission at ^aris nay te supported | ty us in their effort to find securities for the baghdad-Basrah section and also to secure revenues to replace those she will j lose in the territories in Europe that have teen ceded to the Balkan allies and which were affected to the Baghdad Railway, and^ she has intimated that on these conditions she would te willing | to consent to our arrangement with Turkey. We have made no reply to this suggestion as yet. The Tur- ' -kish Government have not yet formed a new company to rep-ace the German Company, and therefore the right of the Baghdad Rail- -way Company to construct the line from Baghdad to the Persian Gu-f still holds good. If the German Government raise the ques- -tion of the Baghdad-Khanikin line, I shall reply that it is a natter which concerns the Russian Government, tut so far ^er- -many has not troaohed the matter to us.

G-osohen to Sir E. Grey. No. 185. Sir, berlin, 15th May 1913. The German press has teen somewhat exercised iti its mind as to the negotiatiohs teing carried on in London tetween His Majesty's Government and the Porte on the subject of* Kuwait and the Baghdad Railway, especially as to the manner in which German interests will te affected. According to some press re -poros Germany has given her consent to the arrangement, whuj-e other papers maintain that the arrangement tears an$ Anglo-Russianj character and was concluded over Germany's head. Conspicuous among these latter papers is the 'Vissische Zeitung”, which put -lishes a telegram from its Paris correspondent to the effect that, a new treaty has teen concluded tetween His Majesty s Government and Turkey, giving to the former paramount influence over the Basrah-Kuwait section of the Baghdad Railway. 'In return for this', the telegram continues, 'England undertakes to tuild up the hartour of Basrah, which is of great importance to the Bagh dad Railway, On the T’Jirko-Persian frontier Turkey cedes the territory of Urmia, a concession obtained ty England in the in terests of Russia, in return for Russian support'. The telegram concludes ty outlining the other provisions of the agreement,in- -cluding the reforms in Anatolia and Syria promised ty Turkey. In commenting on its correspondent's telegram, the 'Fiss- -ische Zeitung', after expressing the hope that England's role of honest broker during the Balkan crisis was not prompted ty self-interest, and after admitting that the above-mentioned terms contain in themselves nothing otjectuonatie to Germany, says that it will te impossitle to judge whether England has teen playing fair in the Kuwait question till the tadly-needed German official statement on the subject appears. This official statement has now appeared in the form of the following telegram to the 'Kolmsche Zeitung .- 'The press has teen tusy discussing the negotiations now in progress twtween England and Turkey atout the Baghdad Railway. The two Governments have hitherto made nothing known as to the trend of these negotiations, though it may even now te stated tliat the view is incorrect that the Anglo-Turkish negotiations will prejudicially affect German interests, ut can te conf.dent iyin confidently^/ asserted that there is/no quarter any intention of ignoring the rights of the Baghdad Railway'. (Received on the 15th June 1913 with Political Secretary's letter No. 22, dated the 00th May 1913). he had ascertained that there was no intention, as we had heard, to deflect the main line of the Baghdad Railway at Mosul, he pro- —ceeded to mention what he descrited as 'one or two points of de— -tail' regarding our original conversation of the ^th ay. to As Sir E. G-rey had warned me tefore that I was not/discuss any fresh proposals, I told Herr Kuhlmann that I would merely listen to what he had to say and report it. Since some of his'points of detail/ are to the advantage of Germany, I think it is very desiratle that Sir. E. Grey should have the minute, and my ordiginal record of Herr Kuhlmann's ^roposais It will te recollected that Herr Kuhlmann has accepted that record as an accurate version of his proposals, and a copy of it is annexed. The important point., to tear in mind is that paragraph with Germany: I was particularly careful to keep it out ty the wording of my minute. The suggested conditions of the targain with Germany are to te found in_y in paragraphs 1 to 4 of my record. When he came on the 20th M a y, Herr Kuhlmann said he understood^ (This is intelligltt&amp;e from the German standpoint, uuu we eiiuu.^u. « prefer to participate owing to our special interest0 in the river and for other reasons.) I have etc., d/- W. E. Goschen. ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA (21st May). CONFIDENTIAL Section 2. 23501 No. 1. Minute ty Mr. Parker. Sir A. Nicolson, Herr Kuhlmann came to see me yesterday and, after saying that tefore him when he sees Herr Kuhlmann to-morrow. 6 does not enter as a condition of the proposed written agreement the German Company wou^d prefer to tuild the port The Germans, he said, wotAd like the conditions for control- I \ -lingcontrolling the port ay -^asrah to te the sane as those which ex- -ist at H a idar Pasha (opposite Constantinople). He wou^d explain those conditions later. If we did exercise any share of control, he said he would prefer that it should te done through the pro- -posed Shatt-el-Arab. Comasssion. (Prina facie, there seems no otjection to this, tut it must te fully looked into). The G-eraan Government could not atsolutely prohit it any Ger- -nahS sutject from tuying shares in the new navigation company, or even from engaging in navigation, tut they would undertake not j to 'encourage or support' any ^erman sutject in taking part in the navigation. The German Government hoped, however, for the | j sake of putlie opinion, that the word'monopoly' might te avoided in the agreement with Turkey. I said I would report his remarks, tut that the monopoly was the essence of the whole thing, just as in effect the Germans had a monopoly dn the railway, and I said it seemed to me impossitle to secure our otject if the word were omitted. He said the German Government hoped we would agree to give an undertaking that there should te no discrimination tetween the different nations in regard to river traffic rates. (®his is quite reasonatle). Then he said, if the Compnay agreed to the 'indefinite post- -ponement' of the line from Basrah to the Gulf, it would require financial compensation from the Turkish Government for that aec- -tion (100 miles or so). (The Germans seem to intend to squeeze the poor Turks, tut this is not our tusiness.) Lastly, he said that the company wished not merely to secure the allocation of specific revenues for the main line up to ^as- -rah , tut also for the branches (which include the Khanikin tranch). He said this was detail which need not te specially trought to Sir E. Grey's attention, tut it is, owing to the intro- , -duction of the Khanikin tssnch, a very impuruant detail, and however important the construction of the Khanikin xa. tranch may k* te as an artery of British trade, there seems little doutt that - j Russia will oppose any attempt on Germany s part to secure the ^ i&gt;i immediate allocation of revenues for this tsanch, as the date of completion of that tranch has an important effect on Russia's otligations under the Potsdam agreement. The Baghdad Railway C ompanyCompany is of course already entitled, under the original oon- -cession of 1903, to secure the allocation of revenues for that tranch eventually, tut I think we should stipu_ate with Herr Kuhl— -inann that, having regard to the exhausted financial condition of Turkey at the inornent, the company should te content if they secure the allocation of revenues for the main line up to Basrah, leaving [ the tranches till a later date. Otherwise there will te a sharp divergence of opinion in the Financial Commission at ''aris. Meanwhile, it seems important to maintain the position that the question of securing the allocation of revenues for the railway does not enter as a condition expressis vert is into our targain with Germany. All that Herr Khulmann asked on the 7th May was a sort of collateral assurance that we wou^d help then to get SKaurliq. security for the main line to Basrah. It seems very desiratle to tie the G-ermans down as soon as possitle to their undertaking at out the river navigation, lest they should whittle it away, and I venture to suggest that a Draft Agreement should te prepared at referendum. 21st May 1913.

We had made up 0 J.r minds that nothing could prevent the railway from going to ^asrah, and we had decided that the point for us to safeguard was that the status quo in the Persian Gulf should not te disturted. An agree- -ment,ad referendum, had therefore teen drawn up with a represen- -tative of the Turkish Government, under which there were provi- -sions at out Kuwait, Bahrain, El Katr, and so lorth, for securing the status &lt;£uo in the Persian Gulf, provisions at out the navi- -gation of the Shatt-el-Arat, and a stipulation that the Baghdad Railway®) &amp; , Railway should not go teyond basrah v/ithout our consent. We had ] not clainied participation in the Baghdad Railway, tut were to have |j two directors on the toard of the railway from Konieh to basrah. These directors would, of course, not te atle to exercise control, tut they would te atle to see that, in practice as well ao ^n j theory, there was no differentiation did take place, in which case we should make diplomatic representations. , Since we had made this arrangement with Hakki Pasha, the G-erman Government had tegun to Sj^eak to us on the sutject. Appa» -rently, they were entitled to claim from Turkey that the baghdad Railway should, in one way or another, te continued to the Persian ^ Gulf; and they said that, therefore, Turkey cou±d not foroge with- -out their consent the right to make the railway from basrah to the Gulf, but this consent they were willing to give if there was no opposition to the railway teing made to basrah, and if they could te assured that the financial gurantees for making the line up to baghdad, which would te lost ty the cession of Turkish ter- -ritory in Europe to the allies, would te replaced, and ii further guarantees were secured to carry the line on to basrah. This was a matter that would come tefore the Financial Commission in Pans, and if I could not commit myself to the German Government without first discussing the Latter with the French and Russian Governments We were now satisfied that, if the railway did go teyond basrah, we need not regard it as teing prejudicial to british interests, and we need not oppose it. The French Ambassador was under the impression that we had s cured the right to tuild the section from feasBah to the Gulf, and had teen offered the baghadd-Khanikin branch. I assured him that this was not so. We had not acquired any right to tuild any sect-ion, and we had no participation. It was tiaue that something had teen said ty an unauthorised German to Mr. Lynch, who was also an unauthorised person, as far as these tegetotiations were concerned, about, giving us the branch from baghdad to Khanikin. but I had discourgged any idea 01 such a propo sal teing troughh into the discussion, as it seemed to me to affect the arrangement that Russia had made at Potsdam - an arrangement that was connected with the Khanikin branch.

I believe, yos* The story of the Baghdad Railway points the way out* Had the l, internationalization ,, of the project been carried out at the start before an ambitious Kmperor, arousing Pan-Germanic dreams, suceeded in attaching to the undertaking political aims which soon overshadowed the commercial and industrial aspects, there would have been no clash among European nations over the historic highway. That highway would have been opened up to the entire West, and the process begun by Napoleon completed to the benefit of the world - to the benefit of the East as well as of the West, and all nations would have had their share* 'Inter nationalization' means co-operation among European and American nations, and such co-operation spells also partner ship with the East, instead of domination. 'Internationaliza tion' in enterprises that are of importance to the world as a whole is a guarantee of mutual good faith, for where all share in the results, there is also a sharing of the feeling of responsibility* Internationalization brings home the convic tion that the interest of one nation is bound up with the interest of all the others involved* Ever since the decline of the Turkish Empire, Turkey has needed the support of European nations, and this support should have been given, not for the sake of Turkey, but for the sake of the East, of which Turley was merely the chief symbol* Instead, Turkey has been exploited now by one ^roup now by another. The European nations have been standing around the bedside of the 'sick man of Europe' (as Turkey has been called) for half a century, quarreling over the division of the prospective corpse* It is not an edifying spectacle. But even if Turkey should die, the East would still be there, the various peoples of the East, the Turks, the Armenians, the Arabs, the Egyptians would still remain.The weakness of the Turkish Empire should be interpreted as the call of the East to the West to come its support - to bring new life to it# The great opportunity will cone at the close of the war# It rests with the West to direct the momen tous changes which the East is forced to face into a channel that will lead to its resuscitation. The policy of 'inter nationalization', so plainly suggested by existing conditions in the East, should at least be given a trial. Let a beginning be made with the reorganization of the Bagdad Railway on a basis which will divide the investment among the capitalists of various nations interested, with equal representation in the Board of Control. That will be the first important step towards opening up the great highway to all. Asia Minor is the 7;orld , 8 highway. It should be secured for the benefit of the world. The fate of the East, dependent upon the control of the route stretching from Constantinople to the Persian Gulf, should not be at the mercy of any one nation. The proposed policy would further involve the 'inter nationalization' of Constantinople under the protectorate of an international commission, with a circuit around it, the neutrality of which should be guaranteed not by a few Powers but by the concert of nations. Internationalization has been tried in the instance of the Danube commission and has worked satisfactorily. Why should it not apply to Constantinople as the starting-point of the great highway ? Sir Edwin Pears, whose life-long residence in Constantinople makes him a valuable witness to the needs of the East, has been advocating its 'internationalization' since the beginning of the war, and the plan is meeting, one is given to understand, with favor in France. The overthrow of autocracy in Russia strengthens the claims for such 'internationalization' of the historic city on the Bosphorus. Constantinople in the hands of Russia would never have led to a solution of the Eastern Question. On the contrary. It would have complicated it by another aggravating factor. The Russian Revolution has repudia ted the policy of conquest, which was a part of the old regime. Russia, the republic, has no interest in boiling Constantinople, ifif under an w inte’national w protectorate the passage through the straits will be open to all nations* Kesopotairia, Palestine and Arabia should likewise be placed under an- ,, intemational ,, protectorate, and its populations be piven the opportunity of developing their capability for autonomy, which at present they do not possess* Let England after the war resume the protectorate over Egypt which she has held for so many years, and encourage the education of the population so as to fit them for Home ilule; and France should do the same for Algiers and Tunis* The 'internationalization' of Morocco, begun some years ago in a tentative fashion, should be made more definite, as a guarantee against a partitioning which would be an injustice. Finally, Turkey should again become what she originally was - an Asiatic empire* Her fatal error, as we have seen, was the attempt to become also a European power* That ambition led to her decline* The natural capital of Turkey is Konia (the ancient Iconium), which the Seljuk Sultans had chosen as their residence* The policy of 'internationalization' should be extended to Armenia, which should be organized as a separate state under the protection of the ooncert of nations, and Persia should 10 be freed from all semblance of foreign domination and her neutrality similarly guaranteed by all the powers# 10 . The flagrant wrong done to Persia in 1911 by &amp;ussia and England must not be glossed over. It needs to be undone thoroughly and unflinchingly. Brandes comes close to the truth when he calls Persia 'the Asiatic Belgium'.
