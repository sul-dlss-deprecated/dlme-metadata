&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;"&gt;In this episode, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;" href="https://complit.illinois.edu/people/eric-calderwood"&gt;Dr. Eric Calderwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;"&gt;, Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;" href="https://complit.illinois.edu/"&gt;Department of Comparative and World Literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;" href="http://illinois.edu/"&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;"&gt; speaks about his recent book, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674980327"&gt;Colonial al-Andalus: Spain and the Making of Modern Morocco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;"&gt; (Harvard University Press, 2018). Dr. Calderwood offers an overview of his book, and reflects on how the time he has spent in Morocco (especially Tetouan) has shaped his research topic and his understanding of Moroccan history and literature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:'times new roman', times;font-size:10pt;"&gt;Grounded in nearly a decade of research in Spain and North Africa, &lt;em&gt;Colonial al-Andalus&lt;/em&gt; explores the culture, politics, and legacies of Spanish colonialism in Morocco (1859-1956). It traces the genealogy of a widespread idea about Morocco: namely, the idea that modern Moroccan culture descends directly from al-Andalus. This idea is pervasive in contemporary Moroccan historiography, literature, and political discourse. &lt;em&gt;Colonial al-Andalus&lt;/em&gt; argues that Morocco's Andalusi identity is not a medieval legacy, but is, instead, a modern invention that emerged from the colonial encounter between Spain and Morocco in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In pursuit of this argument, the book examines a diverse array of Arabic, Spanish, French, and Catalan sources, including literature, historiography, journalism, political speeches, tourist brochures, and visual culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <itunes:summary>In this episode, Dr. Eric Calderwood, Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at the Department of Comparative and World Literature, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign speaks about his recent book, Colonial al-Andalus: Spain and the Making of Modern Morocco (Harvard University Press, 2018). Dr. Calderwood offers an overview of his book, and reflects on how the time he has spent in Morocco (especially Tetouan) has shaped his research topic and his understanding of Moroccan history and literature.

Grounded in nearly a decade of research in Spain and North Africa, Colonial al-Andalus explores the culture, politics, and legacies of Spanish colonialism in Morocco (1859-1956). It traces the genealogy of a widespread idea about Morocco: namely, the idea that modern Moroccan culture descends directly from al-Andalus. This idea is pervasive in contemporary Moroccan historiography, literature, and political discourse. Colonial al-Andalus argues that Morocco's Andalusi identity is not a medieval legacy, but is, instead, a modern invention that emerged from the colonial encounter between Spain and Morocco in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In pursuit of this argument, the book examines a diverse array of Arabic, Spanish, French, and Catalan sources, including literature, historiography, journalism, political speeches, tourist brochures, and visual culture.

Dr. Eric Calderwood is an Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he also holds faculty appointments in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, the Center for South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, the Program in Medieval Studies, the Unit for Criticism and Interpretive Theory, and the Program in Jewish Culture and Society.
