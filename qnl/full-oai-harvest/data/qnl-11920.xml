The report contains an extensive description of the Colonel's journey, including the geographic and botanical features of the region between Muscat and Buraimi as well as any military fortifications that exist. The report also describes the various tribal and clan leaders and their relationships to the Wahhabis in Nejd and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Most of the report is a personal account of Colonel Miles' impressions of the ruins and hamlets of the region, their ancient origins in legend and contemporary situation.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Samuel Barrett Miles</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Buraimi</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geographical exploration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00007c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
