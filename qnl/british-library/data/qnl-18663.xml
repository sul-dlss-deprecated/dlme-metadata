The Governor General in Council has the gratification of announcing the capture of Bassein, and of publishing, for general information, the Despatches which report the com bined operations of the Naval and Military Force by which this service has been executed. In ascending for sixty miles a River still very imperfectly known, in effecting the landing of tiie Troops, and capturing the City, the Fort, and the Stockaded Defences on both sides of the River, fully garrisoned and armed, and in accomplishing all this with very unequal num bers, and within the limits of a single day, the combined forces at Bassein performed a gallant and spirited-service, which well deserves the approbation and applause of the Government of India. To Major General Godwin, C. B., and to Commodore Lambert, the Governor General in Council has again the satisfaction of offering his cordial acknowledgments ol the ability and good-will with which they have united their exertions for ensuring success to the operations in which they were engaged. The Governor General in Council begs to repeat his thanks to Major Boulderson, Deputy Judge Advocate General, to Captain Latter, to Captain Chads, A. D. C ., an d to Lieutenant Ford, of the Madras Sappers, for their conduct in the field on this — His Lordship in Council desires especially to mark his sense of the services rendered by Major Errington, II. M. 51st Light Infantry, commanding the detachment of Troops at Bassein, and to Commander Campbell, of the Indian Navy, by whom the Stockade upon the right bank of the River was stormed and taken. To Captain Rice, Captain Darroch, and Lieutenant Carter, of H. M.'s 51st Light Infantry, to Lieutenant Ansley, 9th M.

GODWIN, c. b., Commandin 0- the Forces in Ava, Arracan, and Tenasserim Provinces. To CHARLES ALLEN, Esquirk, Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Fort William. Dated Head Quarters, Rangoon, 24M May 1852. Sir, The Governor General having expressed some anxiety about the South part of Arracan, as being in the neighbourhood of Bassein, I resolved, as soon as I could conveniently leave Rangoon, to take a Detach ment, and personally visit the place. On expressing this intention to Commodore Lambert, he, to my very great pleasure, said he would accompany me. I fixed on Monday, the 17th May, and had a Detach ment warned to be ready to embark on that morning, consisting of 400 of the 51st K. O. L. I., 300 of the 9th Madras N. I., 07 Madras Sappers, and a Serjeant and 6 Gunners of the Bengal Artillery. The whole party was placed under the Command of Major hrrington, of the 51st L. I. The Commodore appointed three fine vessels to carry the troops—the H. C. S. F. ' Sesostris and ' Moozuffer,' and the ' Tenasserira,' with a smaller Steamer, the ' Pluto,' carrying the Naval Brigade and Marines of H. M.'s Frigate ' Fox.' We cleared the Rangoon River on the afternoon of Monday, the 17th, and on the next evening anchored oft Negrais Island, leading into the Bassein River. At daybreak the next morning the Flotilla weighed, and we ascended that most beautiful stream for 60 miles, which at 4 o'clock brought us in view of the defences, of about a mile long, of the City of Bassein. We had passed some new Stockades, one at, and the other South of Naputa, a few miles below the town, which were not armed, but these consisted of one extensive Stockade, with several hundred men in it, fully armed, and with cannon. The enemy looked at us, but did not show any disposition to molest. Ihe Hotilla arrived at the left of their position, a strong well-built Mud Fort, armed with cannon and men. I his we passed within two hundred yards, and so in succession all their defences, for nearly a mile, till the ' 1 enasserirn,' with the Commodore and myself on board, anchored opposite a golden Pagoda, centrally situated within the defences. The Steamers anchored in succession without bringing down the fire of a singltTmusket. The admirable position taken up by the Steamers induced me to order the immediate landing of the Troops. The enemy appeared so completely surprised and paralyzed by our approach, that I gave orders not to fire unless fired on, and to take possession of the Pagoda. Nearly all the men of H. M.'s 51st Foot got on shore under the Pagoda before a shot was fired. Captain Latter, my Interpreter, accom panied Captain Darroch with a Company of the 51st on shore, and landed on the extreme right of the works, opposite a traverse, covering a gateway, and there a parley was held between Captain Latter and some Burmese on the Walls, which brought on the first discharge of Musketry, killing a Serjeant and wounding two men. This fire was taken up and ran down the works, but soon ceased. At this time Major Errington made his advance on the Pagoda, and carried it in most gallant style, the 51st L. I. maintaining nobly the character they had ever commanded by their courage and distinguished conduct in the field. The contest that stamped the operations of this remarkable day with a brilliant conclusion was the attack on the Mud Fort, most scientifically built, and of great extent, which could only have been con structed under a ikftfpotitfllt that commanded the labour of its subjects, in the short time they had been about it. It was not entirely completed in its details within. The storming party, under Major Errington, proceeding to the left of the Burmese works, accompanied by Lieutenant Rice, of H. M.'s Frigate ' Fox,' and Lieutenant Ford, of the Madras Sappers, came upon this Mjid Fort fully garrisoned and well armed. The attack was most determined, as was the defence obstinate. It was bravely stormed, but with the consequence of Major Errington and several Officers and men being severely wounded. Lieutenant Ansley, with a small Detachment of the 9th Madras N. I., shared in this contest; he was severely wounded, and the Corps proved itself to be as good as it looks, and it is one of the nicest Corps I have ever seen, its gallantry and devotion on this occasion claiming the admiration of all who witnessed it. Ihe whole affair w as over a little after six o'clock. While these operations had been going on, the Commodore had claimed the services of Captain Camp bell, of the ' Sesostris,' and his men, in destroying a large Stockade on the opposite bank of the River. They drove off the Burmese, fired the Stockade, and took six guns. I am informed from several sources that the Enemy suffered very severely in the contest in the Mud I-ort. In having the honor, as well as the gratification, of reporting to the Governor General in Council the possession of this important- Station, I will observe that, from every indication of preparation going on, the Government of this Country intended to make it a most powerful place, and to repair the loss of Rangoon by establishing Bassein as their mart of communication with this Country, as well as a powerful position to keep in subjection the Pegu population, so decidedly and ever our friends, and also to maintain a threaten ing attitude towards the South of Arracan.[ 1405 ] By leaving Bussein to itself, I should have been giving it back to the soldiery just driven out, as the defences had been built and put into tire improved state 1 have described by five thousand men from the Upper Country, commanded by a man of reputation. To secure it 1 h ive left a Garrison of two Companies (160 men) of tire 51st L. I., and three hundred men of the 9th Madras Native Infantry. These will be icinfoiced by an ()lHcei of Aitillery, and half a Company with two 9-pouuder Guus, the Garrison now possessing two 12-inch Howitzers. These, with two months' rations, will leave this on or about the 2t)th instant. Major Roberts, of the 9th M. N. I., will proceed in the same Vessel to take Command of Bas- sein • he is an experienced and excellent Officer. I consider that in a few weeks the Burmese Soldiery of the Upper Country will have returned to their homes, meeting with no sympathy from the Pegu population, and the Pegu Soldiers themselves arc already with their families, so that the Garrison I have left could, in a Military point of view, be withdrawn in six weeks : and it will then remain with the Government of India to decide whether it hold during the War this very important place ; if so, further arrangements will be very necessary. Major Fraser' the Commanding Engineer, should visit it. A very little expense will make' it a secure position. The Bar rack houses the Soldiery are now in are excellent, and well built of wood. Fresh meat can be had, as the population of the place are coming under our protection in great numbers. ( ^ may here lemaik, that that most admirable Officer, and clear-seeing man, my most respected late Commander, Sir A. Campbell, attached great importance to the holding of Bassein.' After passino two clear days in arranging for the stability of the Detachment to be left here, on the morning of the 2:2nd the Flotilla, with the exception of the ' Sesostris,' which remains, weiuhed at day break, and reached Rangoon on the 2.3rd May, after an absence of only seven days. lo Comniodoie l.anibeit, and to this combined Kxpedition, the Governor General m Council owes ail that professional ability and unremitting exertion could accomplish towards success to which they so lartrely contributed. 1 he H. C. Steamer ' Proserpine,' Commander Brooking, arrived 24 hours after the place was taken, but even so his activity was not lost, for he and his Vessel went off the mornin;-- before we weighed, and destroyed the Stockade that I mentioned to have passed on the way up to the River. Major Kr ring ton, ofll. M.'s 51st L. 1., who commanded the Detachment of Troops embarked for Bassein, \\ ho piincipall\ directed this Detachment, and who fought this Detachment, deserves the particu lar thanks of the Most Noble the Governor General in Council. I have great pleasure in forwarding' his Report of the operations, for the perusal of His Lordship in Council. ! ,)e g' 1,16 tre* 1 consideration of Government for Captain RicCj and Lieutenant Carter, of. the 51st LMit infanti\, and foi laeutenant Ansley, ot the 9tii Madras Native Infantry, all three severely wounded at tlu; assault of the Fort, and also for Lieutenant Ford, of the Sappers and Miners, on the same occasion; for Lieutcnaiit luco, 1,-a oi ilei Majesty s I'rigate ' hox, who commanded the Naval Brig'ade, and who was severely wounded w hilst particularly distinguishing himself in the attack of the Fort. It has been brought to my notice that Mr. Duncan, the 2nd Officer of the II. C. Steamer ' Tenasserim,' at the head of a party of men of his Ship, behaved most gallantly upon the same occasion. lo Captain Darroch, of the 51st L. L, and to Captain Latter, mv Interpreter, thanks are due for their gallantry in forcing the traverse, and entering at the gate on the right of the enemy's position. Lieut. Craster, of the Bengal Engineers, also merits thanks, and the Plan of Bassein, which I enclose for the Governor General's inspection, will prove his professional competency. To Lieutenants Elliot and Niwht- ingale, with the Marines of 11. M.'s Frigate ' Fox,' and to Captain Campbell, of the H. C. Steam Frigate ' Sesostris,' 1 beg your Lordship in Council's kind consideration. To Doctor McCosh, and the Officers of the Medical Department, thanks are particularly due. I he Naval part of the Expedition, both Sailors and Marines, supported the character that has ever been theirs of undaunted courage. ^ -G c i I ^ ^ antm 0 roniotiiiK . ^ in not more particularly naming Corps or individuals, but in. this peculiar warfare of constant assaults on well-armed and strong positions, often well defended, it has been the noble emulation of all to be first into the enemy's works. It was in such an effort of ambition that that fine and gallant young Officer, Lieutenant Doran, of the 18th R. I., felt pierced with four balk, far in advance of his proper post. Indeed, I might fill my report with names, were all to ba individualized! 1 now beg particularly to bring to the notice of the Governor General in Council, Major Boulderson, of the Madras Array, the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Force, who on this occasion accom panied me, and filled the two posts of Assistant Adjutant and Assistant Quarter Master General to the Expedition, as I could not move, from their important duties at Rangoon, Adjutant General Mayhew iror Quarter Master General Allan. The Major has been of much essential service to me in various ways; and the judicious manner in which he posted the Pickets after the capture of Bassein, in that wilderness of houses and jungle, tended to the perfect security of the Force. Captain Chads, my A.D.C., never leaves me, and alwavs^makes him self particularly useful. Since my last report nothing worthy of note has occurred at Rangoon. The Town is increasing in importance by the crowds of Natives, who daily come in with their families and goods, as is the 'case throughout the neighbourhood, but especially at Kemmendine, which is as large a place as Rangoon. I he conduct ot the Troops is excellent, and their health is improving daily since the rain has set in. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., (Signed) H. GODWIN, Lieut.

Dated Her Majesty s Ship ' Fox's' Boat, at Bassein, 20th May 1852. I request you may be pleased to inform the Most Noble the Governor General of India in Council, that the Lieutenant General Commanding the Forces, having communicated his wish to make an attack on the City ot Bassem, I placed a Squadron of four Steamers at his disposal for this service. 2. On the morning of the 17th instant. Lieutenant General Godwin, C. B., the Commander of the + i 0r n!u ® mb . arked * n t lle Squadron with four hundred of Her Majesty's 51st Regiment, three hundred of the 9th Regiment Madras Native Infantry, sixty Sappers and Miners, the Royal Marines, and a Detach ment of Seamen, with a Field Gun from Her Majesty's Ship ' Fox.' 3 I left the Naval Forces at Rangoon, in charge of Commander Tarleton, with the ' Fox,' and went with my boat to the ' Tenassenm,' in which Steamer I hoisted my Broad Pendant, and put to Sea at two o clock in the afternoon, with the Steamers named in the enclosure marked A. Ihe Lieutenant General accompanied me in the ' Tenasserim.' 4. ()n the evening of the 18th, we anchored off the Island of Negrais, at the entrance of the Bassein r, where the ' Pluto' joined us. I had sent her on from Rangoon a day previously, as her small power could not have enabled her to keep up with the Steam Frigates. 5. At daylight on the 19th, Squadron weighed and proceeded up the River. The ' Pluto,' from her b ?, lng . ahead ' showin g the soundings. The ' Tenasserim' led, followed by the ' Sesostris' and Moozuffer, at half a cable's length distant. yf 6. At a few minutes after four o clock in the afternoon, the Fortifications of Bassein appeared in si&lt;'ht consisting of a very extensive Mud Fort, and a long line of Stockade on the left bank, on which the City .stands, and a strong Stockade round the Pagoda, with a brick parapet fronting the River. Then in an adnnrable position on the right bank, stood a very large Stockade, mounting several cannons. J he Enemy permitted the Squadron to approach unmolested. 7. At half-past four, when abreast the Stockades, I made the signal to anchor: immediately afterwards Lieutenant General Godwin expressed his wish to land the Troops, which was effected in perfect order in a very short period. I hey had scarcely formed under the Lieutenant General's direction, when a heavy fire was opened, both with Cannon and Musketry, from the various Stockades, which was instantly answered by a cheer from the party landed, who stormed and carried the Pagoda. As soon as the Enemy commenced firing, the Ships opened their fire on the different Batteries. Ubseryin^ the Stockade opposite the Town had been silenced, I directed Commander Campbell, of the Sesostris, to land with the Boats of his own Ship and the ' Moozuffer s,' and to storm it, which he[ 1408 ] effected in gallant style, driving the Burmese from their Guns with considerable loss to them in killed and wounded. Commander Campbell has called my special attention to the zeal and activity displayed on this occasion by Lieutenants Robinson and Lewis, of the Indian Navy. At half-past five I had the satisfaction of hearing that the last and most formidable of the Stockades had been carried, but not without considerable loss on our part, from the great resistance shown by the linemy. Amongst those I have to enumerate as sufferers on this occasion, 1 have to name Lieutenant George W, Rice, of Her Majesty's Ship ' Fox,' who received a severe and painful wound through the right hand, whilst gallantly leading his party of Seamen into the Stockade. 1 fieel it my duty also to mention the steady conduct of the lloyal Marines, under the Command of First Lieuterfant John Elliott; and I cannot conclude without expressing my best thanks to Commanders Camp bell and Jlewett, of the Indian Navy, for the skill and ability with which they brought their Ships up a River, which has hitherto been but imperfectly surveyed, for a distance of more than sixty miles ; nor can t refrain from expressing how much I am indebted to Commanders Dicey and Burbank, of the Bengal Marine, for the assistance I received from them; and I attribute our being able to perform this service, without accident, to the careful and judicious manner with which the Commander of the ' Pluto' went in advance and communicated the soundings. I cannot forbear bringing to His Lordship s notice Mr. Francis Duncan, Second Officer of the ' Tenasserim,'—he was by the side of Lieutenant Rice when he was wounded, and in storming the Stockade his conduct was most gallant. My thanks are general to the Officers and men who served under my orders on this occasion, for the steady, gallant, and cheerful conduct with which they performed the duty ; neither can I omit remarking that the most perfect unanimity prevailed between the two services. 8. Since my last visit to Negrais, the old Governor of Bassein has been removed, and the Government entrusted to another Officer, who arrived here from Ava with four thousand regular Troops, which increased the strength of the Garrison to six thousand men, 9. I have the honor to forward herewith a List of Killed and Wounded in the Squadron; the Casualties Enclosures amongst the Troops, I understand, amounted to about twenty-five more, and I also enclose a B and c. Return of the number of Cannon captured from the Enemy. I have the honor to be, &amp;c., &gt; (Signed) GEORGE R. LAMBERT, Commodore. //. M.'s Ship ' Fox's' Boat, at Bassein, 2Qlh May 1852.

In having the honor, as well as the gratification, of reporting to the Governor General in Council the possession of this important Station, I will observe that, from every indication of preparation going on, the Government of this Country intended to make it a most powerful place, and to repair the loss of Rangoon by establishing Bassein as their mart of communication with this Country, as well as a powerful position to keep in subjection the Pegu population, so decidedly and ever our friends, and also to maintain a threaten ing attitude towards the South of Arracan.K j [ 1405 ] By leaving Basseln to itself, I should have been giving it back to the soldiery just driven out, as the defences had been built and put into the improved state 1 have described by five thousand men from the Upper Country, commanded by a man of reputation. To secure it I have left a Garrison of two Companies (I6p men'i of the 51st L. I., and three hundred men of the 9th Madras Native Infantry. These will be reinforced by an Officer of Artillery, and half a Company with two 9-pounder Guns, the Garrison now possessing two 12-inch Howitzers. These, with two months' rations, will leave this on or about the 26th instant. Major Roberts, of the 9th M. N. I., will proceed in the same Vessel to take Command of 13as- sein; he is an experienced and excellent Officer. I consider that in a few weeks the Burmese Soldiery of the Upper Country will have returned to their homes, meeting with no sympathy from the Pegu population, and the Pegu Soldiers themselves are already with their families, so that the Garrison I have left could, in a Military point of view, be withdrawn in six weeks ; and it will then remain with the Government of India to decide whether it hold durino- the War this very important place ; if so, further arrangements will be very necessary. Major Frase', the Commanding Engineer, should visit it. A very little expense will make it a secure position. The Bar rack houses the Soldiery are now in are excellent, and well built of wood. Fresh meat can be had, as the population of the place are coming under our protection in great numbers. I may here remark, that that most admirable Officer, and clear-seeing man, my most respected late Commander, Sir A. Campbell, attached great importance to the holding of Bassein. After passing two clear days in arranging for the stability of the Detachment to be left here, on the morning of the 22nd the Flotilla, with the exception of the Sesostris,' which remains, weighed at day break, and reached Rangoon on the 23rd May, after an absence of only seven days. lo Commodore Lambert, and to this combined Expedition, the Governor General in Council owes all that professional ability and unremitting exertion could accomplish towards success to which thev so largely contributed. The H. C. Steamer ' Proserpine,' Commander Brooking, arrived 24 hours after^the place was taken, but even so his activity was n6t lost, for he and his Vessel went off the morning before we weighed, and destroyed the Stockade that I mentioned to have passed on the way up to the River. Major Fn ington, of II. M.s 51st L. I., who commanded the Detachment of Troops embarked for Bassein, who principally directed this Detachment, and who fought this Detachment, deserves the particu lar thanks of the Most Noble the Governor General in Council. I have great pleasure in forwarding his Report of the operations, for the perusal of His Lordship in Council. I beg the best consideration of Government for Captain Rice, and Lieutenant Caiter, of the 51st Light I n fan try, and for Lieutenant Ansley, of the 9th Madras Native Infantry, all three severely wounded at the assault of the Fort, and also for 1 . n i /• .i ^ Lieutenant Rice, 1st of Her severely wounded whilst particularly It has been brought to my notice that Mr. Duncan, the 2nd Officer of the II. C. Steamer ' Tenasserim,' at the head of a party of men of his Ship, behaved most gallantly upon the same occasion. To Captain Darroch, of the 51st L. I., and to Captain Latter, my Interpreter, thanks are due for their gallantry in forcing the traverse, and entering at the gate on the right of the enemy's position. Lieut. Craster, of the Bengal Engineers, also merits thanks, and the Plan of Bassein, which 1 enclose for the Lieutenants Elliot and Night- Campbell, of the H. C. St^am . To Doctor McCosh, and the Officers of the Medical Department, thanks are particularly due. The Naval part of the Expedition, both Sailors and Marines, supported the character that has ever been theirs of undaunted courage. O i c (-.en c n. uili (1 vn aiitin 0 . oiik tunc.-^ in not more particularly naming Corps or individuals, but in this peculiar warfare of constant assaults on well-armed and strong positions, often well defended, it has been the noble emulation of all to be first into the enemy's works.' It was in guch an effort of ambition that that fine and gallant young Officer, Lieutenant Doran, of the 18th R. I., fell pierced with four balls, far in advance of his proper post. Indeed, I might fill my report with names, were all to be individualized! I now beg particularly to bring to the notice of the Governor General in Council, Major Boulderson, of the Madras Army, the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Force, who on this occasion accom panied me, and filled the two posts of Assistant Adjutant and Assistant Quarter Master General to the Expedition, as I could not move, from their important duties at Rangoon, Adjutant General Mayhew, nor Quarter Master General Allan. The Major has been of much essential service to me in various ways; and the judicious manner in which he posted the Pickets after the capture of Bassein, in that wilderness of houses and jungle, tended to the perfect security of the Force. Captain Chads, my A.D.C., never leaves me, and always makes him self particularly useful. Since my last report nothing worthy of note has occurred at Rangoon. The Town is increasing in importance by the crowds of Natives, who daily come in with their families and goods, as is the case throughout the neighbourhood, but especially at Kemmendine, which is as large a place as Rangoon. 1 he conduct ot the Troops is excellent, and their health is improving daily since the rain has set in.

Dated Her Majesty's Ship ' Fox's',' Boat, at Bassein, 20th May 1852. r I request you may be pleased to inform the Most Noble the Governor General of India in Council, that the Lieutenant General Commanding the Forces, having communicated his wish to make an attack on the City of Bassein, I placed a Squadron of four Steamers at his disposal for this service. 2. On the morning of the 17th instant. Lieutenant General Godwin, C. B., the Commander of the Forces, embarked in the Squadron with four hundred of Her Majesty's 51st Regiment, three hundred of the 9th Regiment Madras Native Infantry, sixty Sappers and Miners, the Royal Marines, and a Detach ment of Seamen, with a Field Gun from Her Majesty's Ship ' Fox.' 3. I left the Naval Forces at Rangoon, in charge of Commander Tarleton, with the 'Fox,'' and went with my boat to the ' Tenasserim,' in which Steamer I hoisted my Broad Pendant, and put to Sea at two o'clock in the afternoon, with the Steamers named in the enclosure marked A. The Lieutenant General accompanied me in the ' Tenasserim.' 4. On the evening of the 18th, we anchored off the Island of Negrais, at the entrance of the Bassein River, where the ' Pluto' joined us. I had sent her on from Rangoon a day previously, as her small power could not have enabled her to keep up with the Steam Frigates. 5. At daylight on the 19th, Squadron weighed and proceeded up the River. The ' Pluto,' from her light draught, being ahead, showing the soundings. The ' Tenasserim' led, followed by the ' Sesostris' and ' Moozuffer,' at half a cable's length distant. 6. At a few minutes after four o'clock in the afternoon, the Fortifications of Bassein appeared in sight, consisting of a very extensive Mud Fort, and a long line of Stockade on the left bank, on which the City stands, and a strong Stockade round the Pagoda, with a brick parapet fronting the River. Then, in an admirable position on the right bank, stood a very large Stockade, mounting several cannons. The Enemy permitted the Squadron to approach unmolested. 7. At half-past four, when abreast the Stockades, I made the signal to anchor: immediately afterwards Lieutenant General Godwin expressed his wish to land the Troops, which was effected in perfect order in a very short period. They had scarcely formed under the Lieutenant General's.direction, when a heavy fire was opened, both with Cannon and Musketry, from the various Stockades, which was instantly answered by a cheer from the party landed, who stormed and carried the Pagoda. As soon as the Enemy commenced firing, the Ships opened their fire on the different Batteries. Observing the Stockade opposite the Town had been silenced, I directed Commander Campbell, of the ' Sesostris,'' to land with the Boats of his own Ship and the ' MoozufFer's,' and to storm it, which heeffected in gallant style, driving the Burmese from their Guns with considerable loss to them in killed and wounded. Commander Campbell has called my special attention to the zeal and activity displayed on this occasion by Lieutenants Robinson and Lewis, of the Indian Navy. At half-past five I had the satisfaction of hearing that the last and most formidable of the Stockades had been carried, but not without considerable loss on our part, from the great resistance shown by the Enemy. Amongst those I have to enumerate as sufferers on this occasion, I have to name Lieutenant George VV. Rice, of Her Majesty's Ship ' Fox,' who received a severe and painful wound through the right hand, whilst gallantly leading his party of Seamen into the Stockade. I feel it my duty also to mention the steady conduct of the Royal Marines, under the Command of First Lieutenant John Elliott; and I cannot conclude without expressing my best thanks to Commanders Camp bell and Hewett, of the Indian Navy, for the skill and ability with which they brought their Ships up a River, which has hitherto been but imperfectly surveyed, for a distance of more than sixty miles ; nor can I refrain from expressing how much I am indebted to Commanders Dicey and Burbank, of the Bengal Marine, for the assistance I received from them ; and I attribute our being able to perform this service, without accident, to the careful and judicious manner with which the Commander of the ' Pluto' went in advance and communicated the soundings. I cannot forbear bringing to His Lordship's notice Mr. Francis Duncan, Second Officer of the u Tenasserim,'—he was by the side of Lieutenant Rice when he was wounded, and in storming the Stockade his conduct was most gallant. My thanks are general to the Officers and men who served under my orders on this occasion, for the steady, gallant, and cheerful conduct with which they performed the duty ; neither can I omit remarking that the most perfect unanimity prevailed between the two services. 8. Since my last visit to Negrais, the old Governor of Bassein has been removed, and the Government entrusted to another Officer, who arrived here from Ava with four thousand regular Troops, which increased the strength of the Garrison to six thousand men. 9. I have the honor to forward herewith a List of Killed and \Vounded in the Squadron; the Casualties Enclosures amongst the Troops, I understand, amounted to about twenty-five more, and I also enclose a B and c. Return of the number of Cannon captured from the Enemy. I have the honor to be, &amp;:c., ^ (Signed) GEORGE R. LAMBERT, Commodore. //. M.'s Ship ' Fox 's' Boat, at Bassein, 20th May 1852.
