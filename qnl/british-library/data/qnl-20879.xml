The parties are two native Christians, 'both of them converts from Islam, and both residing in Bahrein, 'but not sub jects of the island. They belong to our Christian community, and have lived unmolested here for some years. Is it not sufficient, in your opinion, if I furnish the parties with a wedding certificate, signed by witnesses, and have the same filed at the British Consulate the same as any other legal document? I shall be glad to have your judg ment in the matter by return messanger, if possible. Yours very sincerely, Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, The Consulate.- Bahrein, May 2, 1911 - o Dear Captain Lorimer;- I acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 1st with reference to the marriage which was consummated on the after noon of that day. Enclosed please find original of the mar riage certificate to he registered at your Consulate, in ac cordance with your letter. Kindly let me know the required fee, etc. The latter part of your letter raises the question in what sense Christian marriage is legal on the islands of Bahrein, and the question is of such importance that I would like to raise it with you for information and investigation, and, if possible, that we may secure through you the same rights for native Christians here that obtain in British India or the native states of British India. Our mission has an increasing number of converts from Islam. They enjoy com parative liberty and are free from persecution, but we are anxious to secure for them every legal right as regards re- sidence, marriage, and the holding of property, that would be theirs under the British flag in India. Will you kindly let me know what you can do in the matter; in other words, what steps would we need to take to legalize a marriage of two Arabs converted to Christianity, both subjects of the ruling chief of these islands and neither-2- of them Moslem any longer? Any information or investigation on this question with whioh you can favor us will be greatly appre ciated* The two parties who were married yesterday are neither of them Bahrein subjects. The bridegroom is a Persian and the bride is from Turkey. Thanking you for yoiir kind reply, and for your ser vices in this matter. Yours very sincerely,ib 1911.

Sir, In continuation of the correspondence ending ^vith Resi dency endorsement Wo.1561, dated 13th June, I have the honour to forward, for your information, a copy of the marginally No.1385-G•, dated 20th July 1911ft quoted letter from the Government of India, communicating their views on the queries preferred by the Reverend S. M. Zwemer. I would be inclined to delay any reply to the latter unless he moves or has moved again; and it would be incon venient to discuss with him the change of conditions which will ensue from the introduction of the ^rder in Council*. If you have to give him a reply, you could give him that contained in paragraph 4 of the Government of India letter, and tell him that the views of the Government of India on the other points referred to will be communicated later. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. Lieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.—■ 7 H 4 ; Copy of a letter No.l385-G., dated the 20th July 1911, from the AesiBtant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to refer to your letter Wo.1533, dated the 11th June 1911, forwarding correspondence in which the Reverend S.M.Zwemer raises certain points regarding Christian Marriage in Bahrein. Ho enquires:- (i) To what extent Christian Marriage is legal in Bahrein (ii) How far can Christian converts from Islam (a) Foreign (b) Bahrein subjects be considered to possess the same rights in respect of residence, marriage and property as they would enjoy as Christians under the British Flag in Native States in India. 2. I am in reply to say that so far as Bahrein subjects are concerned the question as to whether marriage between Christans is legal or illegal must depend on the municipal Law of Bahrein. The Sheikh has the exclusive right of regulating the proceedings in his own Courts of Justice and it is apparently within his power to prohibit Christian Marriage among his subjects. So far as the Government of India are av/are no such prohibition has ever been promulgated. The only practical test, therefore, for deter mining whether or no Christian Marriage is legal would be to ascertain whether the rights and obligations of such a marriage contract are enforceable in Bahrein Courts. Could, for instance, a Christian husband or wife obtain in the Bahrein Courts a resti tution of connubial rights ? In existing conditions the position is the same as regards British subjects and foreigners and will so remain until, in virtue of the 'Order in Council for Bahrein' which it is proposed to pass and by the authority of jurisdic tion derived by us from the Sheikh, British Indian Laws, or such of them as it is considered desirable to apply, commence to oper ate in Bahrein Territory.3. in regard to the second question raised by Mr.Zwemer I am to say that the Government of India ooncur in your views. They have no information as to whether Christian Converts suffer from disabilities under the existing Muniscipal law of Bahrein. But in any case Bahrein subjects would be subject to the laws of Bahrein and would not be entitled to more than our ^.ood offices. A change in religion cannot affect in any way their obligations to obey the laws of the State to which they ar6 subject. 4, You are authorised to inform Mr.Zweraer that arrangements are under consideration, and will, it is hoped, shortly be given effect to for placing the Notarial functions of the Political Agent on a more definite and effective footing.■OP.

Lorimer replied that the marriage certificate may be registered at the Agency, citing a previous marriage in 1909 as a precedent. He did, however, state that the Agency would take no responsibility for the consequences of the legality of the marriage being challenged (folio 3).Lorimer wrote to the Political Resident (Colonel Percy Cox), asking for further guidance on the legal status of the couple, and whether their status as Christians afforded them protection from the British Government (folios 7-8). Cox replied that the Political Agent’s notarial functions were being considered by Government, and that the couple’s conversion to Christianity should not relieve them of their obligation as subjects of Bahrain (folios 10-11). Cox referred the matter to the Government of India for further clarification (folios 13-14).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
