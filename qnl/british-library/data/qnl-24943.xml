This list, as it now stands, is satisfactory, particularly as one or two of the persons named therein are said to be only awaiting the publication of the necessary permission to resign their authorisation. 4i. The proclamation submitted herewith in English and Arabic is sufficiently brief and contains all the information necessary to define the conditions of authorisation to fly the French flag. It has been drawn up to the satisfaction of His Highness the Sultan and the French Consul, and I trust will have the approval of the Government of India and yourself, in which case I respectfully request the favour of being supplied with 100 printed copies of the Arabic version for circulation in Oman. Monsieur Laronce and I do not consider it necessary that the proclamation should be countersigned by us. 5.

These final negoeiations and the preparation of the necessary documents have been somewhat delayed by my having been indisposed. 7.

HIS Majesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the Memo randum communicated by the French Ambassador on the 8th November last respecting certain outstanding questions in connection with the Award of The Hague Tribunal in the Muscat Arbitration Case. His Majesty’s Government, desirous of arriving at an early settlement of the points still under discussion, are prepared to accept the French reservations as to— 1. The finality of M. Laronce’s opinion after a fresh examination of the list of dhows and flagholders; 2. The jurisdiction of the French Consul over crimes committed by an Omani on the high seas while sailing in a dhow flying the French flag; and 3. The status of the six Zanzibari dhow-owners. They are also willing to agree to the clause in the Memorandum of the 8th November last respecting the grant of the right to fly the French flag to Mascatis in the service of French citizens resident in Oman, provided that the interpretation of this clause given in M. Gambon’s Memorandum of the 26th April last is formally accepted by the French Government, and also on the understanding that natives navigating dhows entitled to fly the French flag under this special agreement will not have other privileges than those conceded to masters and crews of dhows entitled under the Award to fly the French flag, unless they come under the category of persons “ actually in the service of the French,” referred to in Article IY of the French Treaty with Muscat of 1844. Finally, His Majesty’s Government would be glad if the French Government would agree to instruct the French Consul at Muscat to furnish annually to his British colleague a separate list of dhows owned by French citizens as well as a list of persons entitled to fly the French flag, in return for similar lists which would be furnished to him by His Majesty’s Consul.

When the two officers had come to an agreement in the mattei, the list would be forwarded to His Majesty’s Grovernment throuo - h their Consul. M. Laronce had also been directed to concert with Major Grey as to the best means of bringing the results of the arbitration to the knowledge of the subjects of the Sultan of Muscat. M. Geoffray was instructed to add that it would no doubt have been more in conformity with the status of Muscat as an independent State, if the decision of The Hague Tribunal had been carried into effect by means of a direct agreement between! Seyid Feysal and the F rench Government. In accepting my proposals M. Rouvier had desired to give a fresh proof of the loyal and conciliatory spirit in which he intended to bring the question of the Muscat dhows to a definite settlement. I am, &amp;c.

His Majesty’s Government would therefore propose, for the consideration of the French Government, that the British and French Consuls at Muscat should be instructed to concert together (1) as to the best method of making known the results of the arbitra tion to the subjects of the Sultan, and (2) as to the drawing up of a list of the subjects of the Sultan who are still entitled to fly the French flag. The result of this conference should be referred by the two Consuls to their respective Governments for approval.

I have the honour to remark upon the local position of affairs in connec tion with the settlement of the French flag question in Oman, which is still under discussion. 2. Flag-holder No. 7 in the Laronce list of 4th March 1906, Rachid ben Khamis, died two months ago. It is evident from the record that the French Government admit that on the death of any owner named in that list his dhows cease to possess authorisation to fly French flags. M. Laronce, however, who must have heard of Rachid’s decease, has taken no steps to recover the flags and papers connected with the two dhows entered as being his property, and they are still flying the flag as during his lifetime, being now the property of his two brothers as one was before. Presumably my colleague considers that while the whole matter is still under consideration, and until the proclamation to be issued by the Sultan has been promulgated, it is not incumbent upon him to effect the recovery of flags and papers in circumstances such as those now reported; and it would, I suppose, be considered advisable by His Majesty’s Governmi nt that I should not call his attention to the death of Rachid until the time comes for framing the proclamation; I have therefore merely made a note of the occurrence for the present. 3. The following changes have taken place in regard to the list since its presentation to me by M. Laronce :— (1) Mohammed ben Abdullah ben Sultan’s cousins have sold their dhow, the Mouth Sahel, and the litre de navigation and flag have been returned to M. Laronce, who will presumably retain them until another dhow is produced by Mohammed as its successor. (2) The dhow “ Fath el Kheir”, for which Abdulla ben Khamis ben Ali had taken a litre, really belonged to one Ali ben Said of the Bani Ruwahah tribe. The latter has now sold it and the litre and flag have been returned to M. Laronce. (3) Abdullah ben Khamis ben M’sellem has sold his boat the “ Othmani”, and has returned its litre and flag to M. Laronce. (5) Djouma ben Said oued Belal. This man’s boat the “ Fath el Kheir ” has been wrecked and he has returned its litre and flag to M. Laronce. (14) Hoded ben Nasib has no boat and has no intention of providing him self with any. (16) “ Fath el Kheir ” the boat of Abdulla hen Mohammed ben Rachid Temmami has been wrecked. He has no boat at present and has no intention of taking another litre from the French. (19) Mohammed ben Rachid El Malky sold Ids boat two years ago; he has returned his litre and flag to M. Laronce and has no intention of taking them again. i t:l. ■(20) Mohammed hen Rachid El Rotly has returned his titre and flag to Laronce and has taken an Arab flag from the Sultan under which his boat the “ Sahala” is now flying. The above numbers are those of the holders concerned in the Laronce list. 4. During my recent visit to Sur in connection with the wound received by the Eania Jairam, I was glad to notice a slightly better spirit prevailing among the Jennebeh Sheikhs. Some of them cannot yet be described as entirely r submissive to His Highness the Sultan, but affairs are improving at Sur, and I attribute this mainly to the provisions of clause 6 of the Hague Arbitration judgment, which were made known to the Sur community shortly after the fact of their having been put in force had been communicated to the Sultan by M.

March last, of v/hich a copy was sent to your Department in the letter from this Office of the 16th. of February last (No. 3539). It will be seen that in Monsieur Gambon’s opinion the meaning of the sentence in question is that the French Government hold that a French citizen residing at Muscat and owning dhows, will have the right to sail them under the French flag, even if they are manned solely by natives in his employ; but they do not claim to be able to authorize in the future, native Omanis, even The Under Secretary of State, India Office.(*) even if in the service of a Frenchman, to fly the French flag on dhows which they may own as private pro perty.

Major Grey’s views are as follows :— Begins. French flag. Foreign Department letter No. 4880-E.B., dated the 22nd December 1906, and enclosure. Point 1. I do not see why opinion of French Consul should be final on a matter of fact in which I have made far more thorough investigation and have been careful to include reliable information only in my statement. 2. Unimportant, provided that concession is really limited to crime committed at sea. 3. At least four of the Zanzibar men are undoubtedly Oman subjects who were included in the 1904 agreement by a mistake or a trick. Would it not be possible for the present to decline to consider the question of flying flag by subjects of the Sultan of Mask at in the service of the French in connection with the present case to which it seems to be separate, as it would be a pity to have any clause of that kind in the Sultan’s notification. No such privilege has ever been granted by us. Ends. My views are as follows :— Begins. Point 1. Further investigation may prove waste of time with M. Laronce as sole judge. I suggest that both Consuls be instructed to consider available evidence together, divide number of cases over which they cannot agree and allow final odd man benefit of doubt. 2. I agree with Major Grey. 3. The creation in the case of six new men, who are clearly not entitled to it, of the right to full French protection when in Oman, which will include title to fly French flag over their houses, is much more prejudicial to the Sultan’s local interests and our own than His Majesty’s Government perhaps realise. Apart from this, the true status of the men must have been familiar to Mons. Ottavi from the first, and their insertion as proteges at Zanzibar was effected one year after agree ment of French and British Governments of May 1903 to refer flag question to Hague Tribunal. Perhaps His Majesty’s Government could be moved to reconsider their decision upon this point or at all events to obtain suitable quid pro quo, such as mutual recognition of Sur creek as inland lagoon where protection of French flag will not penetrate. 4. The French presumably rely on Article 4 of Treaty,, but it has never been thus taken advantage of by them or us in the past and motive of introduction now is patent. I endorse Major Grey’s views. The introduction of suggested 1 practice in the Gulf would be most inconvenient, and I trust can be altogether resisted. If this is not possible, I suggest that in any case extension of privilege be limited to boatmen belonging to recognised salaried servants of Consulates i drawing pay of at least £6 sterling per mensem, and to occasions when owners themselves are on board, lists of these being exchanged annually with us and furnished to Sultan.

Grey has been particularly drawn to the paragraph in Monsieur Gambon's com munication relative to the grant of thereconnu par le Trait,e de 1844, d^ccordcr notre pavilion aux Mascataie au service de Prancale resident dans l , Qnan droit dont l f exercice pourrait, dans certaines even- tualites, porter le nombre des Poutres navlguantsous pavilion Prancais au-dessus du chlffre de la liste de Monsieur Laronce 1 Sir Edward would be greatly obliged if Monsieur Gambon would explain, more pre cisely, the nature and scope of the reser vation which the French Government desire to make on this point as it is difficult to see in what manner Omani subjects who are the owners or Masters of dhows could in that capacity, be in the French serv ice and entitled to the privileges ac corded by Article IV of the Treaty of 1844 and the passages in the a.vard dealing with Omanis in the service of Frenchmen would seem to show t^at the same view was taken by then From Viceroy, 20th January 1907. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 18th December. Muscat dhows award. We note that His Majesty’s Government have decided not to resist French reservations as to, (1) finality of M. Laronce’s opinion, (2) jurisdic tion over crimes on high seas. With regard to status of the six Zanzibari dhow owners, we would refer to Cox’s letter,!® B., 26th June 1906, and would only add that grant of right to full French protection to these men when in Oman would he very prejudicial to the Sultan’s local interests as well as to our own. They were only entered as protest a year after agree ment to refer to Hague tribunal. In our opinion point should, i£ possible, not he yielded without suitable quid pro quo, such as mutual recognition of Sur creek as inlet of lagoon where protection of French flag will not penetrate. With regard to Omanis in French service, we would suggest that, in order to avoid raising question of precise nature of rights conferred by Article IY. of Franco-Muscat Treaty, 1841, French Government should be given assurance that those rights, whatever they may be, are not affected by the proposed arrangements. It might be pointed out that British Government possess precisely similar powers, under Article 14, Muscat Treaty of 1891, and that present arrangement will certainly not affect those powers. We regard it as very doubtful whether the Article in either treaty can legally be interpreted as conferring on Omanis in service of British, or French, right to fly national flag of their employers, but point will doubtless be decided by Law Officers of the Crown. If it is decided in affirmative, and if French insist on reservation, we can only suggest that His Majesty’s Government should make counter-reservation to the effect that they regard the privilege as limited to recognised salaried servants of the French, and for such period as they were actually in French service. Lists of such persons should, if possible, be exchanged annually with us and be furnished to Sultan. Cox observes that Article IV. of French treaty has never been thus taken advantage of in the past, and that introduction of suggested practice in the Gulf would be most inconvenient.Xo n Department! are requested, if they suspect that there Jany mistake in this telegram, to communicate immediately mth the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of Slate.

Sir I am directed fcy Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknow- containing observations on the French Memorandum of November 5th in regard to the questions which have still to be settled in connexion with the Arbitral Award of the Hague Tribunal respecting dhows flying the French flag in Muscat. Sir E. Grey understands that Mr. Secretary Morley does not consider it of essential importance to resist the French reservations as to: (1) The finality of Monsieur Laronce's opinion after a fresh examination of the list of dhows and flagholders. (2) The Jurisdiction of the French Consul over crimes committed by an Omani on the high seas while sailing in a dhow flying the French flag - and ledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo (3) The Under Secretary of State India Office.(3) The status of the six Zanzibari dhow-owners In this view Sir E. Grey entirely concurs. The French claim that Omanis in the service of French residents in Muscat are entitled under the Treaty of 1844 to the grant of the French flag is now put forward for the first time, and it would be impos sible to deny that the acceptance of this contention without reserve might result in the perpetuation of a list of French flagholders which would deprive the Ar bitral Award of its finality. The possibility of successfully contesting the French claim is, however, open to doubt. The question seems really to turn upon the exact meaning to be assigned to the words •personnes qui sont bona fide au service des Francais, which occur in the penultimate recital in the Award to the answers to the second question submitted to the Tribunal. Sir E. Grey does not consider, as suggested in your letter, that these words could be held to include persons who can only be colourably represented as be ing in the service of a French resident, but it wouldbe difficult to contend that they are not sufficiently wide to justify the grant of a French flag to persons who are admittedly in the bona fide service of French In these circumstances Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn whether Mr. Morley considers that the point should be pressed, and, if so, whether he can suggest the wording of a reservation which might be attached to the acceptance of the French claim by His Majesty's Government. Sir E. Grey considers that it would certainly be desirable, if possible, to avoid the delay which would be involved in referring the point to Monsieur Lammasch for his decision. men I am Sir Your most obedient humble ServantIn any further oommunic*&gt; lion on this subject, please quot* No. •3771,7 and address— The Under-Secretary of Stato, Foreign Office, London.

The discussions which have taken place between the French Consul at Muscat and his British colleague have, however, unfortunately shown that considerable divergence of opinion exists between these two officers, and His Majesty’s Government have been obliged to carefully examine the question in consultation with the Government of India and to give full consideration to their views. In these circumstances it was inevitable that some time should elapse before His Majesty s Government were in a position to pronounce a definite decision. I have now the honour to inclose a Memorandum dealing with the points of difference which have arisen, and proposing a settlement which I trust the French Government will accept as a friendly and conciliatory solution of the question. (Signed) 13 ™’ &amp; EDWARD GREY. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. WITH reference to the communication made by the French Ambassador on the 22nd June last, His Majesty’s Government have had under their consideration the reports from His Majesty’s Consul at Muscat of his negotiations with his French colleague in regard to the application of the Muscat dhows Arbitration Award of August last. It would appear that Major Grey and M. Laronce have agreed that the result of the Arbitration should be notified by the Sultan to his subjects by means of a Proclamation to be issued by His Highness, but that they are unable to come to an agreement as to the list of persons who are to be entitled to fly the French flag according to the terms of the Award. The following ct projet de Reglement ” for the settlement of these questions was communicated by M. Laronce to Major Grey on the 20th April last:— “ Article l er . Les sujets du Sultan qui sont autorises a 1’avenir a arborer le pavilion Francais sur leurs navires jouissent dans I’Oman du meme traitement et des memes droits que tous les autres sujets de Sa Hautesse. “ Art. 2. En principe, les personnes autorisees a arborer le pavilion Franyais sur leurs navires sont celles dont la liste a ete dressee par le Consulat de France a Mascate, et remise au Oonsulat d’Angleterre le 4 Mars, 1906, k moins de modifications pouvant resulter du deces de ces personnes on du retrait par la France de I’autorisation. “Art. 3. Les proprietaires de boutres battant pavilion Frangais pourront en toute liberte vendre leurs navires, ou en acheter d’autres sans que leur droit au pavilion Frangais puisse etre conteste. [2133 y-Y]2 .i?/ ^ Art 4 Les boutriers qui ont le droit d’arborer le pavilion Fra^ais ne pourront transmettre ce droit a leurs h^ritiers, descendants, on collateraux ; les boutres dont ceux-ci obtiendraient ainsi la possession arboreront \e pavilion du Sultan. Art. 5. La juridiction du Sultan sera applicable dans 1 Oman a tons les pio- pridtaires de boutres battant pavilion Francais, ainsi qu aux capitaines et aux membres, de 1’equipa^e ; toutefois, pour les crimes et les debts on contestations, ayant eu lieu bord en haute mer ou dans les eaux territoriales de 1 Oman, et en general part out on le droit d’inviolabilitd est reserve, la competence restera au Consul de b ranee, ou a ddfaut a son representant, ou aux officiers de la Marine Nationale. Si le crime ou debt est etabli, le coupable sera remis au Sultan. . “ Art. 6. Les dispositions du present Keglement, apres approbation des Gouverne- ments Francais et Anglais, seront communiquees, ainsi que le texte de la sentence, par voie d’affiches, aux sujets du Sultan.” , 4 )&gt; 1 1 His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction the friendly and conciliatory manner in which the two Consuls have carried on their negotiations, they are, however, unable to admit that M. Laronce’s attitude and proposals are in accordance with either the spirit, or the letter of the recent Award. M. Laron ce apparently claims that authorization to fly the French flag was given to each and every owner once for all-—that is to say, if once it is admitted that a particular Muscat! falls within one of the categories authorized under Part I of the Award, then, under Part II— ' • ■ ' (a.) He is entitled to fly the French flag over any and,every dhow which he now possesses, or may ever possess, and is not limited to the dhow or dhow’s specifically mentioned by name in the revised French list of the 4th March, 1906 ; and (b) That he is entitled to replace any dhow at present in his possession of which he may subsequently become dispossessed by sale or loss. As regards (a), His Majesty’s Government hold that if the authorization granted to the flagholder was originally a general one for all his- dhows, then he will retain that right under the terms of the Award; but that if, on the other hand, the Ofiginal authorization was granted for a dhow or dhows specifically mentioned by name, then authorization for the same dhow or dhows only can be claimed under the Award. It appears that M. Laronce, on being requested to produce a copy of the original authorization for each dhow claimed or to quote the date of first issue, has expressed his inability to comply. Nevertheless, he cannot dispute the evidence available in the recorded specimens of a titres de navigation,” which warrants the presumption that the authorizations issued in the past have in &gt;all cases been made out for single dhows by name and not in a general form. If M. Laronce’s claim, that the first authorization, even though only issued for a single dhow, carries with it the right to fly the Frendh flag over all dhows which the owner may ever possess, were to be admitted, the number of such dhows might be indefinitely increased, and it would be impossible for the 'Sultan to check the process, or to know at any given time how many and what dhows are sailing under the French flag. That it was the intention of the arbitrators to limit strictly not only the number of flagholders, but also the number of dhows* entitled to fly the French flag, is evident from the terms of the Award, in which reference is made, Part I, sections 1 and 3, to “ le droit d’autoriser les navires .... a arborer le pavilion Fran^ais,” and Part II, section 1, “les boutres . . . autorises, &amp;c. ...” Section 2, “ Tautorisation ne pent etre transmise, &amp;c. . . . ou a quelque autre boutre,” and section 3, “Boutres autorises a arborer,” &amp;c. . . . In order to carry out the terms of the Award it is important that the notifica tion which will be ultimately promulgated among the subjects of the Sultan shall contain the names not only of the French flagholders, but also of the dhows which are entitled to carry the French flag, and His Majesty’s Government would not feel justified in accepting any settlement which did not provide accordingly. As regards (6), His Majesty’s Government consider that the claim to replace dhows which have been lost or sold is in entire contradiction with section 2 of Part II of the Award, which lays down that “ Tautorisation d’arborer le pavilion Francais ne pent etre transmise ou transferee a quelque autre personne ou a quelque autre boutre (“ dhow ”), rneme si celui-ci appartenait au meme proprietaire.” The list of French flagholders communicated by M. Laronce on the 4th March, 1906, contains the names of twenty dhow-owners and of forty-five dhows. His Majesty s Consul reports that, as the result of careful inquiry, he has evidence to prove that certain of the dhow-owners are not entitled to the authorization, and that many of the dhows are not the property of the persons against whose names they have been.,8 doiit “s pro. eml)t es i lieu I) deiuiit slit est Gertie. iliatorj )ffe?er, either of the lie now entcied. He considers that the Sultan would be legitimately aggrieved if he wem called upon to recognize claims of the very doubtfhl character of which he is fully aware, and that the list should properly be reduced to fourteen owners and eighteen ow ®‘ 18 seil(; ms divergence of opinion with Ins French colleague would appear 0 ca | 01 a seaic hmg investigation into the evidence for and against the* claims . advanced. • Nevertheless, His Majesty s Government, animated by feelings of sincere good-will toy ai as the French Government, desire to settle this question rather in a spirit of nendly concession than in accordance with a strict interpretation of the terms of the Awaid. ^ Accordingly they are prepared to accept the list of flagholders and dhows communicated by M. Laronce on the 4th March last, subject to the following con ditions :— 1. That the drench Government are satisfied as to bond fide nature of the claims advanced m legaid to which M. Faronce might be invited to consult the evidence collected by his British colleague with a view to further revision. 2. That it is clearly understood that the dhow-owners mentioned in the list have no power of transferring their right, which is personal to themselves, to fly the French flag on dhows owned either wholly or in part by themselves to any one else whether by devolution or otherwise, and that the death of any owner on the list will extinguish the rights which his partners, if any, may have derived from him during his lifetime under his authority to fly the French flag. 3. That the list of dhow-owners and dhows, when finally settled should, under no circumstances, be modified. i shall which )t fed dhows of the peat joutre larch) His prove But as a further concession His Majesty’s Government are ready to admit that, in spite of the terms of the Award, the papers of any dhow named in the list which may pass out of its present owner’s possession while he remains entitled to fly the French flag may be transferred to another dhow belonging to the same owner, provided that the total number of dhows named in the list can in no case be increased. They consider that when the transfer of a flag from one dhow to another is authorized, the French Consul at Muscat should be required to notify the fact immediately to the Sultan, and similarly to furnish to His Highness an annual list of flagholders and their dhows. They would further suggest, for the favourable consideration of the French Government, that M. Laronce should be instructed to inform his British colleague, as a matter of courtesy, of the notifications made to the Sultan on the subject. r There remains a further question in regard to the six dhow-owners in Zanzibar whom M. Laronce claims as French proteges under the Agreement of the 13th May, 1904. It appears, according to the information in possession of His Majesty’s Government, that four of these men are in reality subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and therefore not entitled to French protection under the terms of the Award. His Majesty’s Government are, however, not disposed to press for any further investigation in regard to the validity of this claim, and they are willing to admit that the Arabs in question may be placed in the same position as the other dhow-owners on he French Consul’s list. It is hoped that the French Government will appreciate the liberal nature of the concessions now proposed. ' ” As regards the point raised in Article 4 of M. Laronce’s &lt;c projet de Beglement,’ 1 relative to the French claim to jurisdiction in Muscat over an Omani accused of having committed a crime on the high seas while sailing in a dhow flying the French flag, His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that if the Omani in question leaves the ship and \ proceeds on shore he comes at once under the jurisdiction of the Sultan and is not justiciable by the French Consul. On the other hand, the Sultan has no valid ground of complaint if, without being landed, the man is transhipped for trial at Obokh, or some other place within French territory; nor would it be reasonable for His Highness to object if the man were merely landed so as to enable the French Consul to make arrangements for his being sent for trial before a Court in French territory. It is suggested that clauses should be added to the proposed Notification to the effect that any infringement by any of the subjects of the Sultan of the arrangement now arrived at would be severely punished, and further, that any flag-holders who may desire to surrender their French papers will be permitted to do so. Wktc rHis Majesty’s Government sincerely hope that, in view of the considerable con cessions to which they are prepared to consent, an arrangement on the above lines will prove acceptable to the French Government. Should it, however, he found impossible to arrive at an understanding in the matter, they must reserve their full right to continue the discussion in the light of a strict interpretation of the Arbitration Award.

My Lord, The Hague, August 8, 1905. I HAVE the honour to report that the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal met at 3 o’clock this afternoon and the Award, copy of which is herewith annexed, was read aloud by the Secretary-General in French and English. As regards (a), the scope of the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, in relation to the issue by France to certain subjects of the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, the Award decides that:— “1. Before the 2nd January, 1892, France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only hound by her own legislation and administrative rules.” The date in question is that of the ratification of the Brussels Act, the Court holding that France is, in relation to Great Britain, bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by Article 32 of that Act. “ 2. Owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag, retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee. “ 3. After the 2nd January, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by France as her ‘proteges’ before the year 1863.” The year 1863 is taken as the date at which, in virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Porte, and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new “ proteges ” was regulated and limited. As regards (6), the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who are owners or masters of dhows and possess French papers, or are members of the crew of such dhows, and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and. immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness over his said subjects, the Award decides that:— “1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled, in the territorial waters of Muscat, to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844. “ 2. The authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. “3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy, in consequence of that fact, any right of exterritoriality, which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.” The results of the Award may be summarized as follows :— France may renew the licences to fly the French flag granted to owners of dhows before the 2nd January, 1892. But no licences given since that date are valid, unless the grantee was a bond fide French protege before 1863. Moreover, under Article 2 of (6), the licences in question cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. Thus it would appear that if one of the licensed dhows were to be lost or disabled, the owner, in order to obtain a new licence, mast [1008] B 2 \ iHi (Official Translation.) Meeting of Tuesday, August 8, 1905. on the Secretary-General of the Tribunal to read the Award of the Tribunal, which is as follows : -'=r ' S' Hi. B.iMni. M.«ly *»'l Republic have thought it right by the Declaration of the “tl ^h 1862 to engage reciprocally to respect the independence of His Highness the feuitan ot MUS Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen in relation to the issue, by the French Republic, to certain subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat ’of 7 papers authorizing them to fly the French flag and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of H.s Highness who are owners or master' of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over Whereas the two Governments have agreed by the “ Compromis of the 13th October, 1904, that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of Article I of the Convention concluded between the two Powers on the 14th October, 1903 ; Whereas in virtue of that “ Compromis ’’were named as Arbitrators By the Government of His Britannic Majesty, Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of America; * v a • And by the Government of the Prench Republic, Jonkheer A. P. de Savornm Lehman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the Pree University at Amsterdam, Mbmber of the Second Chamber of the States-General; Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in virtue of Article I of the “ Compromis ” to the King of Italy, His Majesty has named Umpire: Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the University at Vienna, Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament; Whereas the Cases, Counter-Cases, and Arguments have been duly communicated to the Tribunal and to the Parties ; Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supple mentary observations which were delivered to it by tbe two Parties ; As to the first question: Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such grants, and whereas therefore the granting of the Prench flag to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Sultan; Whereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by Treaties in tbe exercise of this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of Article XLVIII of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of the 29th July, 1899, and of Article V of the “Compromis” of the 13th October, 1904, “ to declare its competence in interpreting the ‘ Compromis ’ as well as the other Treaties which may be invoked in the Case, and in applying the principles of international law,” and whereas therefore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act of the Brussels Conference of the 2nd July, 1890, relative to the African slave trade, especially to Article XXXII of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags; Whereas by Article XXXII of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers tom, ^ n &lt; gmnt their flag to native vessels has been limited for the purpose of suppressing slave lading and m the general interests of humanity, irrespective of whether the applicant for the flag may belong to a State signatory of this Act or not, and whereas at any rate l iance is in relation to Great Britain bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act; o o j c -c Wh ereas ^ n orc ^ r attain the above-mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers of the Brussels Act have agreed in its Article XXXII that the authority to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only be granted to such native vessels which shall satisfy all the three following conditions ; 1. Their fitters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons protected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly ; ^ 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district or the authority to whom their application is addressed, or supply a solvent securitv as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable; 3 Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof tnat they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of Slave Trade; Whereas, in default of a definition of the term u protege” in the General Act of the Brussels Confeience this term must be understood in the sense which corresponds best as well to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Pinal Act as to the principles of the law ol nations as they have been expressed in Treaties existing at that time in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice; Whereas the aim of the said Article XXXII is to admit to navigation in the seas infested by Slave Trade only those native vessels which are under the strictest surveillance of the Signatory Powers, a condition which can only be secured if the owners, fitters-out, and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State under whose flag they are sailing; Whereas since the restriction which the term &lt;c protege” underwent in virtue of the legislation of the Ottoman Porte of 1863, 1865, and 1869, especially of the Ottoman Law of 23 Sefer, 1280 (August 1863), implicitly accepted by the Powers who enjoy the rights of capitulations, and since the Treaty concluded between Prance and Morocco in 1863, to which a great number of other Powers have acceded, and which received the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of the 30th July, 1880, the term &lt;c protege” embraces in relation to States of capitulations only the following classes : (1) persons being subjects of a country which is under the protectorate of the Power whose protection they claim ; (2) individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated in the Treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the Ottoman Law of 1863; (3) persons who, under a special Treaty, have been recognized as “ proteges ” like those enumerated by Article IV of the Prench-Muscat Convention of 1841; and (4) those individuals who can establish that they had been considered and treated as &lt;£ proteges ” by the Power iu question before the year in which the creation of new “ proteges ” was regulated and limited, that is to' say, before the year 1863, these individuals not having lost the status they had once legitimately acquired; Whereas that, although the Powers have expressis verbis resigned the exercise of the pretended right to create “proteges” in unlimited number only in relation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States, analogy having always been recognized as a means to complete the very deficient written regulations of the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous; Whereas, on the other hand, the concession de facto made by Turkey that the status of ‘‘proteges” be transmitted to the descendants of persons who in 1863 had enjoyed the protection of a Christian Power, cannot be extended by analogy to Muscat, where the circumstances are entirely dissimilar, the “proteges” of the Christian Powers in Turkey being of race, nationality, and religion different from their Ottoman Eulers, whilst the inhabitants of Sur and other Muscat people who might apply for Prench flags are in all these respects entirely in the same condition as the other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat; Whereas the dispositions of Article IV of the Prench-Muscat Treaty of 1844 apply only to persons who are bond fide in the service of Prench subjects, but not to persons who ask for ships’ papers for the purpose of doing any commercial business; Whereas the fact of having granted before the ratification of the Brussels Act on the 2nd January, 1892, authorizations to fly the Prench flag to native vessels not 11008] Cy-M 'if T^- ' vmr~ ■ V«U| Hi? ■' 8 satisfying the conditions prescribed by Article XXXII of this Act was not in contradiction with any international obligation of France; For these reasons, decides and pronounces as follows :— 1. Before the 2nd January, 1892, France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only hound by her own legislation and administrative rules ; 2. Owners of dhows who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee; 3. After the 2nd January, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to lly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by France as her “ proteges ” before the year 1863. As to the second question :— Whereas the legal situation of vessels hying foreign hags and of the owners of such vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is determined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other Treaties, and by the practice resulting therefrom; Whereas the terms of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between France and the Iman of Muscat of the 17th November, 1844, are, particularly in view of the language of Article III, “ Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins et autres proprietes, possedes ou oecupes par des Franyais ou par des personnes au service des Frangais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de Toccupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec Tintervention du Consul de France,” comprehensive enough to embrace vessels as well as other property ; Whereas, although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right of France to grant under certain circumstances her hag to native vessels, and to have these vessels exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abuse the French hag for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibility of this abuse, which can be entirely suppressed by the accession of all Powers to Article XLII of the Brussels Convention, cannot affect the decision oi this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds; Whereas according to the Articles XXXI—XLI of the Brussels Act, the grant of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel and its owner, and therefore not transmissible or transferable to any other person or to any other vessel, even if belonging to the same owner; Whereas Article IY of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 grants to those subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat “ qui seront au service des Frangais ” the same protection as to the French themselves, but whereas the owners, masters, and crews of dhows authorized to fly the French flag do not belong to that class of persons, and still less do the members of their families; TV hereas the withdrawal of these persons from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, would he in contradiction with the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, by which France and Great Britain engaged themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this Prince; lor these reasons, decides and pronounces as follows :— !• phows Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled in the territorial -waters of Muscat to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844; 2. The authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner; 3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag, or wdio are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact any right of externtonality which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, Done at Ihe Hague, in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, August 8, 1905.

I have the honour to refer to enclosure 8 to the Political Agent, Maskat’s letter No. 167 , dated 21 st April 1906 , in connection with the French Flagnegocia- tions, that enciosure being Major Grey’s criticism of Monsieur Laronce’s list of Flagholders. 2 . As I was in doubt as to the sufficiency of the evidence obtained in regard to Nos. 6 , 13 , 14 and 15 , on the list, and as Major Grey had left Maskat when 1 called there on my return from India, 1 left a memorandum for Lieutenant Shakespear asking him to endeavour to obtain such further evidence as he unobtrusively could with regard to the 4 men in question. 3 . That officer first sent me two memoranda of news obtained from different sources of which 1 attach a copy of the one which I believe to be the most authentic ; and has now furnished me with a final report No. 389 , dated 10 th September 1906 . It will be seen that the collective result of these two reports is as follows :— , (i) In regard to No. 6 , the evidence is not conclusive. There are other men of the name of Salim bin Bakhit and until the man’s nickname or the name of his grandfather and tribe are furnished by the French Consul, his identity cannot be considered established. (ii) No. 13 was concerned in a collision* in Maskat harbour in 1897 and as a subject of the Sultan - External B , November 1897, Nos 48-49 lodged a Suit in the British Consular Court in which he was actively supported by His Highness. (iii) No. 14 is certainly not entitled to fly the Flag, and if he ever was entitled to fly it, which I do not admit, he has clearly forfeited the right. (iv) No. 15 has apparently only had a flag for 8 or 9 years and has no boat at the present time. 4. Since my instructions were given to Lieutenant Shakespear His Majesty’s Government have decided to accept Monsieur Laronce s list and to terminate the negociations in the manner set forth in the Secretary of States telegram of 29 th August. But even if the information now furnished is super- fluous, it may nevertheless be advisable to have it on record. r In conclusion I venture to draw attention to the facts reported in para- o-raoh 6 of Lieutenant Shakespear’s letter; and have the honour to enquire what action the Government of India consider called for by the fact that two of t e Flagholders have intimated in writing to the Sultan that they had returned their papers and Flags to the French Consulate.

About 7 or 8 years ago * External b., November 1897 , Nos. 48 49 - was run * down by a mail steamer in Maskat harbour, and the boat smashed. The steamer was not found to have been in fault, and as the Sultan was therefore unable to press the claim for compensation to the Arab against the Company, the Arab seceded, and having purchased a new boat again took out new French papers and Flag.

Further enquiries, however, in the case of No. 13, Abdullah bin Saeed (wad) Sabir have led me to the belief that this man certainly did not regard himself in 1897 as other than an ordinary subject of His Highness the Sultan, nor did the French Vice-Consul of that date appear to interest himself in him. jE.te,„aiB„N.».mbe, .897, No,. 48.4s.

This case was reported by Surgeon-Lieutenant- Colonel Jayaker to the Residency in his letter No. 240, dated the 2nd September i&amp;97-4 The history of No. 13 , Abdallah bin Saeed (wad) Sabir (or his relative, foi^ the first two names seem to be interchangeable) is given in a separate me morandum, as far as possible chronologically, from this Agency'S records. 5 . Under the circumstances it would appear that this man certainly at one period held French papers but how far legally and to what extent his right to continue holding them after 1897 still exists, when the French Vice-Consul apparently saw no reason to regard him as a ‘ protegd,’ remains for decision. 6 . I may add here that I have received information that two of the proprie tors named in M. Laronce’s list of the 4 th March 1906 , wV.:— No. 2 . Abdullah bin Khamis bin Ali, No. 3 . Abdullah bin Khamis bin Musallam, now desire to return their French papers and flags, and that with tjiat view they handed them over, during M. Laronce’s absence at Sib, to the French Coal Agent at this port. This information has subsequently been confirmed to me in a conversation which I had with His Highness the Sultan a few days ago, when he showed me a letter from these two owners addressed to himself informing him that they had returned, their French papers and flags. Needless to say the French Consulate has not yet communicated the fact to His Highness officially, and it remains to be seen whether such return of papers ever will be communicated. &lt; I l * * 4 * * * i; ; • i •&gt;. • ■ Memorandum of the connection of Abdullah bin Saeed (mad) ' Sabir ” with the Ftench Consulate, Masked, which claims him as a “ Protege”. /c9p/.— In a list of 13 owners of boats covered by French Flags furnished * Pro.No. 191 in Secret E., June 1891 , Nos. by Colonel Mockler With his *letter No. 63, » 8 5-20i. dated the 14 th March 1891 , to the Political Resident, this man’s name does not occur. 1893 . —l n a ^ st furnished with Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel Jayaker’s letter No. 295 , dated the 15 th October 1893 , to the Political Resident, this man (or a relative) appears as “No. 11 .

Sir, Foreign Office, August 22, 1906. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the note which M. Gambon was good enough to address to me on the 31st ultimo on the subject of the Arbitral Award pronounced last year at The Hague in regard to the dhows flying the French flag at Muscat. I regret that the French Government should consider that undue delay has taken place in arriving at an agreement as to the steps to be taken for carrying out the decision of the Tribunal. His Majesty’s Government entirely share the view of the French Government that this matter should be arranged as speedily as possible, and it has been their desire throughout to treat the subject in the most friendly spirit. The discussions which have taken place between the French Consul at Muscat and his British colleague have, however, unfortunately shown that considerable divergence of opinion exists between these two officers, and His Majesty’s Government have been obliged to carefully examine the question in consultation with the Government of India and to give full consideration to their views. In these circumstances it was inevitable that some time should elapse before His Majesty’s Government were in a position to pronounce a definite decision. I have now the honour to inclose a Memorandum dealing with the points of difference which have arisen, and proposing a settlement which I trust the French Government will accept as a friendly and conciliatory solution of the question. WITH reference to the communication made by the French Ambassador on the 22nd June last, His Majesty’s Government have had under their consideration the reports from His Majesty’s Consul at Muscat of his negotiations with his Irench colleague in regard to the application of the Muscat dhows Arbitration Award of August last. It would appear that Major Grey and M. Laronce have agreed that the result of the Arbitration should be notified by the Sultan to his subjects by means of a Proclamation to be issued by His Highness, but that they are unable to come to an agreement as to the list of persons who are to be entitled to fly the French flag according to the terms of the Award. The following “ projet de Reglement ” for the settlement of these questions was communicated by M. Laronce to Major Grey on the 20th April last:— “ Article l er . Les sujets du Sultan qui sont autorises a 1’avenir a arborer le pavilion Francais sur leurs navires jouissent dans I’Oman du meme traitement et des memes droits que tous les autres sujets de Sa Hautesse. “ Art, 2. En principe, les personnes autorisees a arborer le pavilion Fran§ais sur leurs navires sont celles dont la liste a ete dressee par le Consulat de France a Mascate, et remise au Consulat d’Angleterre le 4 Mars, 1906, a moins de modifications pouvant resulter du deces de ces personnes ou du retrait par la I ranee de 1 autorisation. Art. 3. Les proprietaires de boutres battant pavilion Franyais pourront en toute liberte vendre leurs navires, ou en acheter d’autres sans que leur droit au pavilion Frangais puisse etre contests. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) EDWARD GREY. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. [2133 y —1]i'j ,i 2 “Art. 4. Les boutriers qui ont le droit d’arborer le pavilion Fran?ais ne pourront transmettre ce droit a lours heritiers, descendants, ou collateraux; les boutreg dont | ceux-ci obtiendraient ainsi la possession arboreront le pavilion du bultan. ee Art. 5. La juridiction du Sultan sera applicable dans 1 Oman a tous les- prietaires de boutres battant pavilion Francais, ainsi qu’aux capitaines et aux membres de I’equipaa-e ; toutefois, pour les crimes et les debts ou contestations, ayant eu lieu a Lord en haute mer ou dans les eaux territoriales de 1’Oman, et en general partout ou ler^ droit d’inviolability est rdseryd, la competence restera au Consul de Prance, ou. a deiaut ^ son repr&amp;entant, ou aux officiers de la Marine Nationale. Si le crime ou debt est etabli, le coupable sera remis au Sultan. _ c&lt; Art. 6. Les dispositions du present Leglement, apres approbation des Oouverne- ments Frangais et Anglais, seront communiquees, ainsi que le texte de la sentence,' par voie d’affiches, aux sujets du Sultan.” His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction the friendly and conciliatory manner in which the two Consuls have carried on their negotiations, they are, however, unable to admit that M. Laronce’s attitude and proposals are in accoi dance with either the spirit or the letter of the recent Award. M. Laron ce apparently claims that authorization to fly the French flag was given to each and every owner once for all—that is to say, if once it is admitted that a particular Muscat! falls within one of the categories authorized under Part I of the Award, then, under Part II— (a.) He is entitled to fly the French flag over any and every dhow which he now possesses, or may ever possess, and is not limited to the dhow or dhows specifically mentioned by name in the revised French list of the 4th March, 1906 ; and (b) That he is entitled to replace any dhow at present in his possession of which he may subsequently become dispossessed by sale or loss. As regards (a), His Majesty’s Government hold that if the authorization granted to the flagholder w r as originally a general one for all his dhows, then he will retain that right under the terms of the Award; but that if, on the other hand, the original authorization was granted for a dhow or dhows specifically mentioned by name, then authorization for the same dhow or dhows only can be claimed under the Awatd. It appears that M. Laronce, on being requested to produce a copy of the original authorization for each dhow claimed or to quote the date of first issue, has expressed his inability to comply. Nevertheless, he cannot dispute the evidence available in the recorded specimens of “ titres de navigation,” which warrants the presumption that the authorizations issued in the past have in all cases been made out for single dhows by name and not in a general form. If M. Laronce’s claim, that the first authorization, even though only issued for a single dhow, carries with it the right to fly the Frendh flag over all dhows which the owner may ever possess, were to be admitted, the number of such dhows might be indefinitely increased, and it would be impossible for the Sultan to check the process, or to know at any given time how many and what dhows are sailing under the French flag. That it was the intention^ of the arbitrators to limit strictly not only the number of flagholders, but also the number of dhows entitled to fly the French flag, is evident from the terms of the Award, in which reference is made, Part I, sections 1 and 3, to “ le droit d’autoriser les navires .... a arborer le pavilion Fran^ais,” and Part II, section 1, “les boutres . . . autorises, &amp;c. ...” Section 2, “ rautorisation ne pent etre transmise, &amp;c. . . . ou a quelque autre boutre,” and section 3, “Boutres autorisds a arborer,” &amp;c. ... In order to carry out the terms of the Award it is important that the notifica tion which will be ultimately promulgated among the subjects of the Sultan shall contain the names not only of the French flagholders, but also of the dhows which are entitled to carry the French flag, and His Majesty’s Government would not feel justified in accepting any settlement which did not provide accordingly. As regards (6), His Majesty’s Government consider that the claim to replace dhows which have been lost or sold is in entire contradiction with section 2 of Part II of the Award, which lays down that “ 1’autorisation d’arborer le pavilion Francais ne pent etre transmise ou transferee h quelque autre personne ou a quelque autre boutre (“ dhow ”), rneme si celui-ci appartenait au meme proprietaire.” The list of French flagholders communicated by M. Laronce on the 4th March, 1906, contains the names of twenty dhow-owners and of forty-five dhows. His Majesty’s Consul reports that, as the result of careful inquiry, he has evidence to prove that certain of the dhow-owners are not entitled to the authorization, and that many of the dhows are not the property of the persons against whose names they have been.entered. He considers that the Sultan would be legitimately' aggrieved if he were* called upon to recognize claims of the very doubtful character of which he is fully aware, and ^ that the list should properly be reduced to fourteen owners and eighteen •dhows. Tnis serious divergence of opinion with his French colleague would appear .to call for a searching investigation into the evidence for and against the claims advanced. Nevertheless, His Majesty s Government, animated by feelings of sincere good-will towards the French Government, desire to settle this question rather in a spirit of friendly concession than in accordance with a strict interpretation of the terms of the Award. Accordingly they are prepared to accept the list of flagholders and dhows communicated by M. Laronce on the 4th March last, subject to the following con ditions :— 1. That the French Government are satisfied as to bona fide nature of the claims advanced in regard to Avhich M. Laronce might be invited to consult the evidence collected by his British colleague with a view to further revision. 2. That it is clearly understood that the dhow-owners mentioned in the list have no power of transferring their right, which is personal to themselves, to fly the French flag on dhows owned either wholly or in part by themselves to any one else whether by devolution or otherwise, and that the death of any owner on the list will extinguish the rights which his partners, if any, may have derived from him during his lifetime under his authority to fly the French flag. 3. That the list of dhow-owners and dhows, when finally settled should, under no circumstances, be modified. But as a further concession His Majesty’s Government are ready to admit that, in spite of the terms of the Award, the papers of any dhow named in the list which may pass out of its present owner’s possession while he remains entitled to fly the French flag may be transferred to another dhow belonging to the same owner, provided that the total number of dhows named in the list can in no case be increased. They consider that when the transfer of a flag from one dhow to another is authorized, the French Consul at Muscat should be required to notify the fact immediately to the Sultan, and similarly to furnish to His Highness an annual list of flagholders and their* dhows. They would further suggest, for the favourable consideration of the French Government, that M. Laronce should be instructed to inform his British colleague, as a matter of courtesy, of the notifications made to the Sultan on the subject. There remains a further question in regard to the six dhow-owners in Zanzibar whom M. Laronce claims as French proteges under the Agreement of the 13th May, 1 9°4. It appears, according to the information in possession of His Majesty’s Government, that four of these men are in reality subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and therefore not entitled to French protection under the terms of the Award. His Majesty’s Government are, however, not disposed to press for any further investigation in regard to the validity of this claim, and they are willing to admit that the Arabs in question may be placed in the same position as the other dhow-owners on the French Consul’s list. It is hoped that the French Government will appreciate the liberal nature of the concessions now proposed. As regards the point raised in Article 4 of M. Laronce’s “ projet de Beglement,” relative to the French claim to jurisdiction in Muscat over an Omani accused of having committed a crime on the high seas while sailing in a dhow flying the French flag, His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that if the Omani in question leaves the ship and proceeds on shore he comes at once under the jurisdiction of the Sultan and is not justiciable by the French Consul. On the other hand, the Sultan has no valid ground of complaint if, without being landed, the man is transhipped for trial at Obokh, or some other place within French territory; nor would it be reasonable for His Highness to object if the man were merely landed so as to enable the French Consul to make arrangements for his being sent for trial before a Court in Irench territory. It is suggested that clauses should be added to the proposed Notification to the effect that any infringement by any of the subjects of the Sultan of the arrangement now arrived at would be severely punished, and further, that any flag-holders wlm may desire to surrender their French papers will be permitted to do so.His Majesty’s Governaient sincerely hope that, in view of the consideiable con cessions to which they are prepared to consent, an arrangement on the above lines will prove acceptable to the French Government. Should it, however, he found impossible to arrive at an understanding in the matter, they must reserve their fu l right to continue the discussion in the light of a strict interpretation of the Arbitration Award.

The discussions which have taken place between the French Consul at fSuecat and his British Colleague 'onsiour Geoff ray, ac., &lt;*c., &amp;e., Ihave, however, unfortunately shown that considerable divergence of opinion exists between these two of ficers and His Majesty’s Government have been obliged to carefully examine the question In consultation with the Government of India and to give full consid eration to their views.

' Vf ' - ■ u \ * 14 AUG 1906 .j-; Poreign Office August Id .1906 Sir I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state for the information of the Secretary of State for India that he has carefully considered your letter of the 2nd. instant together with the papers previously corn- (j2%\ ^ municated by you on the 13th., 24th. and 26th. ultimo in regard to the Muscat Arbitration Award. Sir E. Grey fully concurs in Mr. Morley's view that in principle there is much force in the observa tions of the Government of India and Major Cox as to the doubtful nature of the French claims and the diffi culty of pressing the Sultan to accept the list of dhow-owners supplied by Monsieur Laronce. He consi ders, however, that when Major Cox contends, as appears from his letter of June 26th. that unless the French list is reduced His Majesty's Governnent wall practical ly sacrifice the results of the arbitration, he loses sight of the two principal advantages which have been Under Secretary of State, India Office.\ secured by the Award. These advantages are firstly thau with the death, of the present flagholders no more dhows privileged to fly the French flag mil remain when the controversy will automatically cease, and secondly that the flagholders directly they land in Oman will come under the Sultan’s jurisdiction. Sir E. Grey is therefore glad to note that Mr. Morley concurs in the suggestions put forward in the letter from this Office No. 20052 of June 27th. with view of settling this long pending controversy with the French Government. The decisions which have been agreed upon are em bodied in the Memorandum of v/hich a draft is inclosed and Sir E. Grey proposes, if Mr. Morley concurs, to communicate this document to the French Ambassador. It will be seen from the accompanying copy of a Note which has recently been received from Monsieur Cambon that the French Government are manifesting some impatience at the delay in the settlement of this ques tion. Sir E. Grey does not consider that this complaint is in any way justified and he will point out to Mon-Monsieur Gambon in reply that before arriving at a de cision it was necessary for His Majesty's Government to consult the Government of India and to give full con sideration to their views. In communicating to the French Embassy the Memor andum above referred to Sir E. Grey proposes to inti mate verbally that if the French Government are unable to accept the liberal concessions now offered to them His Majesty's Government will be compelled to obtain further evidence regarding the dhows for which French papers are claimed with a view of subjecting the list to a searching enquiry, and he will suggest that the other points in dispute should be referred for final decision to Monsieur Lammasch the Umpire in the recent arbitration. * m \ I am.DRAFT, Monsieur Cambon F. C. August, 19C6. With reference to the communication nude by the French Ambassador on the 22nd of June last, IIML Government have had under their consideration the reports from ILM* Consul at Muscat of his negotiations with his French colleague in regard to the application of the Muscat dhows Arbitration Award of August last. It would apjear that Major Grey and Mans. Laronce have agreed that the result of the Arbitmttion should be notified by the Sultan to his subjects by means of a Proclamation to be issued by His Highness, but that they are unable to come to an agreement as tc the list of persons who are to be entitled to fly the French flag according to the terms of the Award. The following J^roje^t de Rkglement for the settlement of these questions was ccmiunicubed by Mens. Laronce to Major Grey on the 20th of April lust:- A,rticle 1. Les sujets du Sultan qui sent autorises &amp; l 9 avenir b arborerflag was given to each and every owner once for all, that is to say if once it is o.driiitted that a particular Masknti falls within one of the categories authorised under Part 1 of JL the Award, then, unde?' Part 1% (a) he is entitled to fly the French flag over any and every dhow which he now possesses or may ever possess and is not limited to the dhow or dhows specifically mentioned by name in the revised French list of March 4th, 1906, and (b) that he is entitled to replace any dhow at present in his possession of which he may subsequently become dispassessed by sale or loss. As regards (a) H.M. Government hold that if the authorisation gwanted to the flagholder was originally a gar oral one for all his dhows, then he will retain that right under the terms of the Award; but that if, on the other hand, the origFial authorisation fferf ^ specif i oat i on—dhow or dhows specifically mentioned by name, then authorisation for the same dhow or dhows only can be claimed under the Award. It appears that Mens. Larcnce, on being requested to produce a copy of the original au'horisation for each dhow claimedfr to quote the datedate of first is sane, has expressed his inability to coviply; nevertheless he cannot dispute the evidence available in the recorded specimens of 'Titres de Navigation*, which warrants the presumption that the authorisations issued in the past have in all cases been made out for single dhows by name and not in a general form. If Mans. Laronce 9 s claim that the first authorisation, ebon though only i ssued for a single dhow, carries with it the right to fly the French flag over all dhows which the owner may ever possess, were to be admitted, the number of such dhows might be indefinitely increased and it would be impossihie for the Sultan to check the process pr to know at any given time hew many and what dhows are sailing under the French flag. That it was the intention of the arbitrators to limit strictly not only the number of flagholders but also the number of dhows entitled to fly the French flag is evident from the terras of the Award, in which reference is made (Part 1) §§ 1 and 3 to n le droit d 9 autcriser les navires b arberer le pavilion francais' and (Part 11) § 1 H les bout res .autorises etc ...”$2 II n l 9 autorisation ne pent 8tre transmise etc ou h quelque autre boutre* and $3 'Boutres autorises harborer etc' • • • • In order to car'ry cut the terms of the Award it is important that the notification which will be ultimately promulgated among the subjects of the Sultan shall contain the names not only of the French flagholders but also of the dhows which are entitled to carry the French flag and ILF. Government would not feel Justified in accepting any settlement which did not provide accordingly . As regards (b) ILF. Government consider that the claim to replace dhows which have been lost or scl$ is in entire contradiction with h of Part 11 of the Award which lays down that : 'L' autorisat ion d f arborer le pavilion Francais ne pent frbre transmit ou transferee h quelque autre personne ou &amp; quelque autre bout re (dhow) m&amp;ir&amp; si celui-ci appartenait an m&amp;nie proprletaire. ' The iffit of Franh flagholders communicated by Mans. Laronce on March 4th 1906 coni ins the names of twenty dhow owners and of forty five dhows. ILM.Consul reports that, as the result of c . refill enquiry, he has evidence to prove that certain of the dhow-owners are not entitled to the authorisation and that many of the dhows are not the property ofthe persons against whose names they hove been entered* He considers that the Sultan would he legitimately aggrieved if he were called upon to recognise claims of the very doubtful character of which he is fully aware, and that the list should properly be reduced to fourteen owners and eighteen ■lows* This serious divergence of cpi nion with his French colleague would appear to call for a searching investigation into the evidence for and against the claims advanced* Nevertheless, II*H*Government, animated by feelings of sincere goodwill towards the French Government, desire to settle this question rather in a spirit of friendly concession (X than in accordance with tfue strict interpretation of the toms of the Award* Accordingly they are prepared to accept the list of flaghclders and ilhows communicated by Hons. Laronce on March 4th last subject to the following conditions:* 1* That the French Govt, are satisfied as to bona fide nature of the claims advanced in regard to which Mens. Laronce might be invited to consult the evidence collected by his British colleague with a view to further revision* 2 *their right, which is person al to themselves , to fly the French flag on dhows owned eit her wholly or in part by themselves to 2.

The Sultan has, it is true, confided his interests to us, but it is clear from correspondence that all parties are agreed that it is indispensable that an authentic list of owners and dhows should form part of the notification to be finally issued by the Sultan, and seeing that His Highness has been consulted all through by us as to details and accuracy of French list of 4th March, and knowing, as well as we do, that moiety of the dhows and several owners have been improperly included, I fail to see how we can fairly ask him to accept and publish it. If we do so he will certainly be extremely aggrieved. He has, in fact, pointed out to me incidentally, that the acceptation of Laronce’s list of fifty dhows would legalise French flag on as great, or a greater, number of dhows than those which have claimed to fly it hitherto, and that during His Highness’ lifetime the practical evil would be as bad in future as in the past.” He adds :—“ Sultan has produced evidence which satisfies me that number eight on the French list, though born in Comoro Islands, has been domiciled all his life at Soor with his family, and is so still. He is not, therefore, entitled to be a protege in Oman.” I trust that these views, which I fully endorse, will be given every consideration. Major Grey telegraphs that he has reason to believe that French Consul would be satisfied with 30 dhows, or perhaps less. If His Majesty’s Government agree, I will instruct him to try and arrange this and I trust that announcement to French Government may be deferred until I can report result of these further negotiations.7 * Political Agent at Masicat,' To - The Foreign Secretary, Simla, Reed, the loth Award negotiations.

Sir, i hava tho homour to r«f«r to my socrtt t«l«gram of tho 14th Instant in connection with^the award negociations in the French flag difficulty; and to give a brief account of thn circumstances which led to its despatch. Monsieur Laronce received a telegram from Paris on the 13th Instant, informing him that his project for settlement has not yet been received in London, and he called upon me on the 14th to enquire how this was. I informed him that I had forwarded a copy to the Government of India by the earliest opportunity, but he seemed to think that I had broken faith withjhim in not sending another to the Foreign Office direct. I pointed out that r was not authorised to do this, and he then enquired as to the views the Govomment of India In regard to his project. I was not ablemad# aut lor simgl® cJiows by mam* amd m©t im a g***ral ferm. But actimg mo doubt om imctructiome from his Govormmemt, Momsiour omly Laromco claims that tho first authorisation, orom though/issuod for a simglo dhow, carriod with it th* right to fly tho Fromch flag / over all dhows which tho owner might over possess. ^ The local officers have dome their best mo doubt to come t© am understanding generally, but seeing that the views of their respective Government amd the imstructions which they have received on this point are so divergent it was mot possible that they should be able to settlo it themselves. It does mot seem to mo that tho Fromch viow cam hold wator for a momont, but tho reason for their anxiety to hurry us into accepting it is not far to seek. If our interpretation is accepted them the number of dhows entitled to sail under French colours will bo limited to such of those mention ed by name in the French list, as the inquiries of our representa tives on the spot prove to be the sole property of persons reeognis ed by the Award, and to have received their authorisations before the committal of the issues to the Hague Tribunal. Those will bo very few,- not more than the 14 provisionally admitted by Major Grey,- and it will bo a simple matter to keep a chock on them in the future, even if we agree to allow them to be replaced within the life-times of their owners so long as the original name is adhered to* On the other hand if the French carry their point and it is he ldheld that the fact of haviag received aa authorisation for one dhow Mtitl.8 M ow»«r to fly th« flag ov.r all dhows of which he may ever become possessed, the* after the aegociatioas are once concluded, we shall have no check whatever nor any practical means of knowing at any given time how many aad what dhows are sailing ^ under the French flag. French Consuls will pursue their hobby just as unscrupulously in the future as they have in the pavSt; on the pretext of part--ownership, the dhows of all a flagholder* kinsmen V’il-t be registered in his name, and in the result the Award which we have been at^infinite p&lt;*ins to Y/in, will be shorn of half its effect. It is of the utmost importance to us that the notification which will be ultimately promulgated among the subjects of the •C ” —— — Sultan of Maskat shall contain the names not only of the persons which have qualified but also of the dhows which are entitled to carry the flag. There can, I submit, be no doubt that the interpretation v/hich we xii! wish to impose is the one intended by the framers of the Award and. I earnestly hope^will,deter us from the endeavour to secure its acceptance. Possibly His Majesty* s Secretary of State for Foreign Affair Affairs will succeed in convincing the French Government that our reading of the terms of the Av/ard is the correct and legitimate one. If hov/ever his efforts in the direction are not successful, then I can only venture to suggest that a statement of the points at issue should be drawn up by our respective Government in con sultationo ff ® p n cojisuitatio!! aact ref.rr.a U ar, Arbitrator, it b, that ther. is fsom. previsiea far such coatxag.aci.a i» the Articles of worki.g rules of the Hague Coaveatio* aad iadeed it would seem a aatural corollary to a settlemoat by the Iribuaal that aay (juestioa of doubtful iat.rpr.tatioa of the t.ims of aa Award should be referred to for decision to the Umpire who sat oa the origiaal Court which d#liv«r*d it. Peimt (b) might b« d«a.lt v»ith i» the atune m«.jw«r t but if th«/ A accept our views as to (a) or if it is eventually decided by an Arbitrator ift our favour, then we might concede (b). It would not under those circumstances be a very important consideration to us. The Status of the 6 individuals whom the French claim as meat* proteges under the Anglo-French Agreement dateq 13th May 1904 in connection with &amp;anzibar. In regard to this question the Secretary of State cabled his wishes on 6 th March. I gather that his view was that supposing that Monsieur larence agreed to accept Major Grey*s suggestion that the cases of the first 4 men named should be decided according to the condition* of the Hague Award, then Major Grey might reciprocate by waiving discussion with regard to the last two, and that the solu tion of the question might subsequently be imposed upon the Sultan of Muscat. As however Monsieur Xaronce did not accept Major Grey f sThat th« Agr««m«at of th« 13th May 1904 was oaly intended to he opex-ative in Zanzibar, and not vis a vis the Sultan of Muscat; xhat His Highness was not consulted and had no notice oi the said Agreement; 2hat the Agreement was maae after the submission of the French Flag question to the Hague Tribunal, that is, at a time when the title ®f every Omani claiming to fly a French Flag was under challenge and sub judice. It is difficult to see how this argument can be got ever, and as it is, in fact, the position already taken up by His Majesty's Government in regard to 4 of the men, I trust it can now be maintained in regard to all six.- In connection with this question Major Grey has suggested apart from the possible cession of Hos. 21 and 22 of the 6 above discussed- that we should offer to resign Hos. b and lb also, if the French acquiesce in the cases of Hos .17 to go being governed by the Award. In view of the observations above recorded I can hardly endorse this recommendation at present, but in any case there is no hurry for a decision ©n this point. On the one hand Monsieur Larence asserts that they were born in the Comoro, and Major Grey may have recorded corroborative evidence on this point; but on the other hand it appears that either these persons or their fathers are included in previous lists furnished by his predecessors, 01 subjects of His Highness flying Frojich Flags nxid 'residing at Sur”. (Vid^ ffas.9 and 11 of Major Hayos Sadl«r f s list of 1894 and Sos. 14 1ft of Major Fagan's list of 1896). Kvon if thoy v/oro b® shewn to bo uoudcilo^d or to koop thoir families ^nd tlioir dhov&lt;s at ^ur, tnty should siirely bo rogardod as coining within tho scope of the Award, and there seems no obligation on our part to consider them French proteges in Oman although their title to fly the flag may be made good. AH I suggest in this case is that tho two men should not b conceded until a little more information is available with regard to them, ^will ask the Political Agent to supply it. (Ill) The final verification of the revised list of proteges and dhows prosenteu by the French Consul on 4th March 19Q6(wrth a view to its inclusion in the Notification subsequently to be issued to the subjects of the Sultan of Muscat.) I do not see that anything final can be done under this head until issue (l) has been decided in Europe. When that fundamental point has been set at rest our local officers will be able to pro coed with the verification of the list, and if in the end one or two individuals remain about whom they cannot agree it might be arranged to split the difference, one being elimated and another conceded. In the working out of this list eur interests and those of the Sultan can only be safely guarded by the submission of born in the Comoro Islos as suggostod, nevortheloss if they can \ 5 everyMohammed ben Each id El Rotily appeared before me Phis day. and shaped as follows I belong po Phe Beni Boo Ali Pribe of Oman and am sub jeep of phe SulPan of MuscaP as were my faPher and grandfarher before me* I was born ap Alga adjoining Sur in Oman, and am spill residing Phere* I have one boap, which sails under a French flag, ip is named in Phe paper given po me by Phe French Phe 'Sahala 11 .

As His Majesty’s Consul had decided not to submit any counter-propo sals and had forwarded to His Majesty’s Government the draft received from his French colleague, the latter was justified in thinking that his proposals had received Major Grey’s approval. Monsieur Paronce had up to the' present received no reply and he had ascertained that Major Grey had given His Excellency, The Right Honourable, Sir F. Bertie, G.C.M.G. ,G.C.V.O.,K.C.B. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;e.,givcm up his intontion of forwarding the draft to London and had sent it to the Government of India. This no doubt accounted for the delay. Monsieur Gambon in calling my attention to his previous representations on this question reques ted me to take all possible steps to arrive at an early solution of a matter which was of no very great importance ana which in view of the good rela tions existing between our two countries and of the conciliatory attitude of the French Government, could be settled without difficulty by simply ac cepting the proposals formulated by the French Con sul at Muscat and accepted by His Majesty’s Consul. I informed Monsieur Gambon that he is under a misapprehension in thinking that His Majesty’s Con sul at ‘Unseat was in agreement with the proposals advanced by his French colleague, Major Grey on the contrary disagreed so completely with Monsieur Laronce that he considered it useless to formulate counter-proposals and had referred the matter to His Majesty's Government. Monsieur AMonsieur Laronce’s proposals were, I added, now under consideration of His Majesty’s Government and a communication would shortly be addressed to His Excellency on the subject.

Sir: - I have laid before Secretary Sir E. Grey your letters ol* the 28th ultimo and 11th instant relative to the Muscat Arbitration Award. Sir E. Grey notes that the negotiations between the British and French Consuls at Muscat have result ed^ in an agreement as regards (l) the best method of notifying the Award to the subjects of the Sultan, but / tnat tney nave been unable to agree as to (2) the list; of such persons who are still authorized to fly the French flag. I am directed by Sir E. Grey to state that he has carefully considered the French proposals for a settlement as set forth in Monsieur Laronce's letter of the 20th oi April and that he is disposed to con cur in principle with the criticisms advanced by l 11 i! II Major The Under Secretary of State India Office.Major Grey in regard to them. He considers however that it is manifestly to the advantage of His Majes ty’s Government to obtain an early settlement of this question, whereas the interest of the French Govern ment cannot with equal force be said to lie in the same direction, and that it would oe worth some sacri fices, if not of a vital nature, in order to secure this object. * Moreover it will be remembered that as no French papers can in the future be issued to iresn dhow owners, the death of the present flaghold- ers must automatically bring the whole question to an end within a limited space of time and this fact renders it all the more desirable to dispose, by reasonable concessions, of what might well prove a source of present irritation and friction if the ne gotiations are unduly prolonged. I am therefore to suggest, for Mr. Morley's con- oideraoion, that His Majesty's Government should ac cept the '.hole list of flagholders submitted by the French Government, without raising any further ques tion as to the validity of the titles they enjoy; andand further that in spite of §2 of the second portion of the Award which deoars the transmission of the French flag from one dhow to another, it should be permitted that the papers of one dhow which has been lost, sola, destroyed or otherwise disposed of should be transferred to one other dhow belonging to the same owner. It should however, be made clear that these concessions only apply in regard to vessels duly authorized to fly the French flag under the terms of the Award ana that the number of dhows thus authorized can in no case be increased. The views already expressed by His Majesty's Government on the point raised regarding jurisdiction on the high seas or in Muscat waters snould be maintained. In ac cordance with the suggestion made by Major Grey the punishment attending any infraction of the new ar rangement might be notified to the subjects of the Sultan and the French flagholders might be informed that they are at liberty to surrender their papers should they desire to do so.I ani to state that, in the event of the Secretary of State for India agreeing generally in the course suggested above, Sir E. Grey proposes to cause a memo randum to be prepared for presentation to the French Ambassador which will be previously submitted for Mr, Morley's concurrence. In the first instance however Sir E. Grey would be glad to be favoured with any ob servations' or suggestions which Mr. Morley may desire to make on the subject. I am to add that the French Ambassador has again called Sir E. Grey's attention to this question and has requested an early expression of the views of His Majesty's Government. I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,.

His Majesty’s Government agree with your views on points 1 and 2. As regards point 3, His Majesty s Government agree that any subject of the Sultan comes under Muscat jurisdiction as soon as he lands in Oman ; but if Omani belonging to French protected dhow is accused of crime on high seas, no objection could be taken to his transhipment, without being landed, to some French port for trial, nor would it be reasonable to object if accused were temporarily landed merely in order to enable French Consul to arrange with above object. Objection, however, would be taken to such Omani being tried by French Consul at Muscat. Grey should be authorised to inform French Consul of conclusions arrived at by His Majesty’s Government on above points, and should endeavour to effect settlement on lines laid down. As regards final confidential paragraph of your message, His Majesty’s Government consider that it would be useless to approach French Govern ment in the matter at present.

I am directed therein to submit a brief report of the net result of my negotiations with Monsieur Laronce in connection with the arbitration award in the French flag difficulty, 2, M. laronce and I were directed, (1) to consult as to the best method of making Jon own to the subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Oman the result of the arbitration, and (£) to make out a list of such persons whoj^re nenceforth to be entitled to fly Fr«nch flags in accordance with the terms of the award. With reference to (l), we agree that the result of the arbi tration snoulcl be communicated by His Highness tne sultan to nis subjects by means of a proclamation to be issued by him. In regard to (), we are unable to agree as to the list of persons who are to be entitled to fly French flags according to the terms of the award. The reasons for our lack of concord in this matter are:- (i) Monsieur Laronce holds that authorisation to fly the French flag was given to each and every owner once for all, tnat is to say for every dhow of which he might subsequently becomebecome the possessor; whereas I hold, in accordance with instructions received, thax authorisation was given m regard to individual dhows only. M, I.aronee professes to be unable to inform me as to the date on which each individual dhow obtained ner lirst titre ae navigation. (ii) II. laronce maintains that his Government will be obliged to insist not only upon their views in regard to point (i) being accepted by us, but also tnat each authorised dhow owner should be allowed to replace any dhow at present in his posses sion of which he might subsequently become dispossessed by (sai]U or by loss. ? { iii) LI. laronce wishes not only that- all the owners named in the list presented by him to me on the 4tn March last should preserve authorisation to fly French flags, but that all the anows named in his list should be registered as being the property of the persons against whose names tney nave been entered. As a result or careful enquiry I have found (1) that some of the dhow owners are not, according to our view, entitled to aut/ior isat ion a» they do no i, actually possess a dnow at tne present time; ana (S) that many of the dnows are nq^Jt the property oi the persons against whose names they nave been entered. ( iv) LI. laronce naft nut accepted tne views of His Majesty’ s Government in regard to tne four subjects of His Highness tne Sultan lor whom protection in hnnaibar naa been obtained by the French according to the Anglo-French agreement of loth May 1^04 (Hos. 17-SO in the French list above referred to). lie has referred this point to his Government. (v) Owners ITos. 8 and 13 in the French list might.in my opinion, be regarded as French proteges in Oman; but M.Laronce could not agree to my proposal that their position as such should be accepted by us in exchange for the views of His Majesty* s Government in regard to Hcs* 17-20 being accepted by the French. It is impossible to formulate the proclamation to be issued by the Sultan until the list of owners and dhows has been agreed upon, and the exact conditions in which the French flag is to be flown by them have been fixed. 3.

From recent conversations with M. Laronoe I saw that he wished to arrive at Sur some days before our enquiry from the dhow owners was to take place, and that he considered that the result of such enquiry should he taken as the final settlement of the point involved. I was unable for obvious reasons to assent to this, and addressed to him my letter No. 164, dated the 18th instant (enclosure 1). M. Laronce’s reply (enclosure 2) needs no comment, beyond that it is interesting to note his change of front regarding the dhows, and difficult to resist a smile at his courageous reference to. the matter reported .Enclosure in Pro.

Prom— Major W. G. Grbt, Officiating Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty^ Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. f l have the honour to make a further report ia connection with the nego- cations now in progress between the Freach Consul at Mask at and myself with a view to fcne sdt&amp;iemeat of tne French Flag question in accordance with the judgment of the Hague Tribunal. 2. I have carried out the instructions contained in the telegram of March 1 st from the Government of India in the Foreign Department. On March 3rd I explained to Monsieur Laronce the conclusions to which His Majesty’s Government have arrived in regard to points (2) and (3) submitted to them. My colleague accepted those conclusions, and in accordance with a request from him, I addressed to him on the 4th instant, the letter which forms enclo sure (1) to this report. He informed me later in the same day that, in sending a copy of my letter to his Government, he had testified to the spirit of conciliation exibited by me in connection with these negociations. 3. On the 4th instant I received from M. Laronce enclosures (2) and (3). The first point to be noted as regards the list is that 11 of the owners’ names which appeared in the French Counter Case list * have been eliminated by M. Laronce. This is satisfactory so far as it goes. One new name has been put in^No. 16, which my colleague says was accidentally omitted from the former lists. This is probably the explanation, as from enquiries which I have made it seems that he has a claim to authorisation, and I do not propose to object to his inclusion. The last six names on the list (17—22) are those ^ t submitted with my letter f No. 568, dated 16th December 1905, and two days in Pr&lt;C$o. ag‘&gt; I received the instructions of Government in regard to their position. It 3 j&amp;brWj! will be seen from M. Laronce’s letter dated 8th instant, enclosure (4), which J was addressed to me subsequent to a discussion on the 7th, that his view is 1 ' 181 ‘ that the status of these persons having been decided by the agreement J of 13th t Appendix May 1904, it should not now be disputed. He claims, moreover, that owners d* Tn Nos. 8 and 13 having been born in the Comoro Islands should be considered Be^reb^^, as French proteges in Oman. I hope to come to an agreement with him in Kro^ 244 ■ 32 l! , these matters during the present week and will submit the result by next mail. The next point to he considered is a serious one, it is that which is connected with my telegram to you of the 8th March. M. Laronce makes the total number of dhows to be protected 51. From enquiries made by me recently I came to the conclusion that several of the owners did not possess the number shewn against their names in his list, and in consequence suggested that His Highness the Sultan should make enquiry at Sur. However on the 9th instant owner No. 4 Salem hen Selim oued Seh516 (French spelling) arrived in Maskat and was interrogated by the Sultan and myself. This man knows all the persons named in the list, and gave us the number of dhows owned by each with further particulars, which I have shewn in column 6 added by me to M. Laroace’s list. 1 will discuss this question also with my colleague during the week and will endeavour to come to some agreement. 4. It will be observed that Monsieur Lironce regulates the claim of each owner to authorisation by the date of the issue to him of his first titre de navigation ; and his view is that a man having received one titre prior to 2nd January 1892 should be allowed to retain authorisation for all or any dhows for which he subsequently obtained titres, up to the present time. This is one of the two questions which I have already submitted with my suggestions for settlement, the other is that of the replacement of authorised dhows during the lifetime of the owner. I beg to repeat that in my opinion the concession offered by M. Laronce, that of the inviolability of French protected dhows ceasing on their entry into the Snr creek, is not equal to the two which are asked from His Majesty’s Government. Monsieur Laronce asks me to say that His Government attach very great importance to these two points.1 6. A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. No. 89, dated Maskat, the 4th March 1906. From— Major W. G. Grf.t, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To— Monsieur R. Laronce, Consul for France, Maskat. In accordance with the arrangement made verbally between ns yesterday, I have the honour to communicate to you officially the conclusions arrived at by His Majesty’s Government upon the points referred to them by me some weeks ago in connection with the negociations now proceeding between us. These conclusions are as follows :—• (1) His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that according to the judgment of the Hague Tribunal the inviolability of a dhow proiected by the French flag does not cease even when at anchor in an Oman port. (2) Should a subject of the Sultan of Oman belonging to a French protected dhow be accused of crime on the high seas, His Majesty’s Government do not consider that there would be any objection to the transhipment and transportation of such person to a French port for trial, even should it be necessary to land him temporarily in the Sultan’s dominion®, pending arrangements being made with such object in view. In the opinion of my Government however, such cases could not be tried by the French Consul in Oman without infringement of the Hague award ; and they hold that according to the decisions of the tribunal, in the case of Omanis, all difficulties and disputes which may occur between the owners, masters, and crews of the French protected dhows, ashore or afloat, should be decided by His Highness except as provided for above. 2. We agreed to postpone the discussion of the question of the replacement of dhows which had received authorisation to fly the French flag before 1892 until the list of such dhows and their owners had been made out, and you kindly promised to supply me with such list as soon as possible.

Sir, In continuation of my letter Ro. 101, dated 12th instant, I have the honour to report further upon the negotia tions in progress for the settlement of the French Flag question. 2. At an interview on the 16th instant, I communicated to Monsieur L&amp;ronce the views of His Majesty’s Government upon the status of owners Ros. 17-22 in the list forwarded with my letter referred to above. He appeared to accept those views at the time, but the following day I received from him a letter intimating that he would reserve his acceptance of the considera tion of Uos. 17 - 20 as subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, pending the receipt of further instructions from his Government (enclosure 1). 3. I then asked Monsieur Laronce whether it would be possible for him to furnish me with the date of the issue of the first titre de navigation to each and every dhow named in his list. He replied that it was impossible, as no record was kept of Pof any ‘but the first tit re given to each owner. I went on to inform him of the interview which I had had with the owner Bo. 4 on his list; and after some conversation he consented to receive the man’s statement as regards tne dhow owned hy himself, hut said that enquiry would have to he made from each of the other owners concerning their actual possessions. I suggested that we should go together and make such enquiry forthwith, hut he pointed out that as most of the owners were now absent from Sur, it could not he made before their return at the end of April. I observed that Salem hen Selim was not likely to have spoken any- | thing hut the truth, and suggested that M. Laronce nad not been supplied with correct information from which to compile his list. He replied that he could not he responsible for any mistakes which might nave been made by the Arabs, and concluded by repeat ing that the individuals, and not the dhows, were the important point in the opinion of his Government. On the 17th instant I received a private letter from M. Laronce (enclosure 2} to which I replied officially (enclosure 5) giving the information sub mitted with my letter Ho. 1C1 in column 6 of the French list. 4. I am now waiting to see whether any, and if any what, steps are'taken by my colleague to show his displeasure at His Highness the Sultan’s action in regard to Salem ben Selim, or at the action of Salem himself in affording me iniormation. It may be suggested that it would have been better had I sent Salem to M. Laronce, but had I done that a good opportunity would havehave been lost of emphasizing the new situation created by the provisions of paragraph 6 of the Hague award. The patience and good temper with which I am endeavouring to conduct these nego tiations are by no means exnausted, but I submit that certain facts have to be made clear to the French sooner or later, one of which is that, as things are now, we expect from them a loyal adherence to the provisions of the paragraph above quoted. 5. An enquiry in !,1ay, as suggested by M. laronce, will not be worth much, as the owners will, upon their arrival at ?ur, be interviewed by a French agent, and instructed as to what evidence to give* I caJinot however think of anything else in the present circumstances which will not be oifensive to the French. 6. I would ask for instructions as to what reply should be given to Monsieur laronce regarding owners Hos. 8 »nd 13 in his list. We might allow them to be considered as French proteges in Oman in consideration of our views being accepted concerning los. 17-20, that is, should it be found on enquiry that they were undoubtedly bom in the Comoro Islands* 7. A copy of this letter will be forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have, etc., (SA) W. G. Grey, Major, Offg.

As you are aware, I had been told by His Highness the Sultan and others that there were some mistakes in the list which you sent to me on the 4th instant as regards tne number of dhows shown as belonging to each owner. On tne morning of the 10th instant I received information that Salem ben Selim had arrived in Muscat from the pilgrimage, and I took tne oppor tunity of examining him in order to discover the truth or other wise of the statements that had reached me regarding tne list. With sucn object in view I requested His Highness the Sultan to send the man to me which he did at 5 P.M. on the loth. 3. A statement of the information given to me by Salem is enclosed. You will see that he owns ^ne possesalon of one boat only, and -chat according to him nearly every owner actually possesses fewer dhows than the number shown against his name. In these circumstances I beg to ask what steps you propose to take to rectify the list, as I can scarcely ask,k “hue i»«ms liiiiv iti !o I Hi lat v my Government to accept it in its present condition.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letters los. 101 and 112, dated 12th and 19th March respectively, and, in view of the aixficuit position created by tne divergence of tne French interpretation of certain points of the Hague Award from that of His Majesty 1 s Government, beg once more to suggest that a compromise might be advisable. 2. The number of His Highness the Sultan's subjects over whom protection, to » greater or less extent, is claimed by France, has now been reduced to twenty, four of whom are con nected with the Zanzibar agreement of 13th May 1*04. M. Laronca imorms me that, on account of strong public feeling in connection with the national flag and its privileges, his Government will be compelled to insist upon their views being accepted in regard to the following two points in connection with those persons :- (1) That the authorisation of an owner to fly French flagsfxags should depend upon the date of the issue to him of his first titre de navigation; and that no question should he raised regarding his right to fly the. flag upon dhows which have flown it only since a date subsequent to 2nd January 1892 up to the present time : (2) That the replacement of, and continuance of authorisa tion to, every dhow possessed by each owner should continue until his death. In exchange lor these two concessions, which are of considerable magnitude, practically nothing is obtainable. 3, The attitude of H.H. Saiyid Faisal towards His Majesty’s Government cannot be said ever to have been entirely satisfactory. My predecessor on arrival in Maskat in 1899 found it necessary to treat him with great indulgence in order to reinstate British influence at his Court, and his experience must nave been, as mine certainly has in continuing tne same treatment, that His Highness, though aiwaya ready to take, was as a rule loth to give; and he has not shewn himself any too willing to accept the advice of Government even when his own good, or the good of his country and people, was the only object in view. In this connection it is only necessary to quote tv/o instances (I) His Highness would not present tne site for a new hospital, although the fact was apparent that the(2) ~h project had been taken in hand solely with a view to the public good, and it had been clearly represented to him that the present hospital building was a disgrace to his capital. His Highness 1 reply was that it was good enough for Maskat. The customs administration. In this matter the Sultan naa consistently rexused to accept the services of an official lent by the Government of India, or even to allow anything to be done to arrange his finances satisfactorily. He remarked to me only last week that it was better for him to be in debt to xifty persons tnan to one alone. 4* Having regard then to the obstructive attitude of His Highness tne Sultan in ques-cions or reform generally, and to tne fax- fact t/iat he has already broken his promise to borrow only from His Majesty 1 s Government (as previously reported by me); and taking into consideration tne amount of time, trouble, ana money which have been expended by us in His Highness 1 s interests in this flag question, I cannot see that we are obliged to continue to support those interests except in so far as they coincide with our own. I am of opinion tnat the best arrangement now would be to allow the French to retain protection over the twenty persons A A contained in their list wherever those persons may be during tneir *6( on condition tnat the declaration ox 186H be abrogated. UL^t r TheI]'!*? position wnien X am cib siren, tio aere ciuring tne existence ox tnat cieciaraTiion is a very ciirrieult one as the Government of India are aware; and although I do not anticipate he mg unable to maintain it in tne luture as in the past, I am inline need in laying before you this rurtner suggestion for a compromise, by the prospect of perpetual worry ana annoyance as long as the declaration remains in force, and the Sultan ana his advisers are able to take advantage of the position to play off one power against the other as circumstanoes may require in connection with tneir oppowition to advancement and reform. 5.

At first they refused to give any information, referring us.to tne Frencn &amp;&amp;hsm C onsul, but alter much discussion gave evidence which proved that the details already gathered from Salem ben Selim ouea seheie were generally correct. On my return to Muscat I informed !£. Laronce of the result of my enquiries but he refused to accept the evidence I had collected saying that his Government wished that an enquiry should be neid by u» together to avoid intimida tion from either side, and that such enquiry could conveniently be made during nis sojourn at Sur in May when all the owners \ would b« present. 4. There is an error in the remarks added by me to M. Laronce 1 s list which iuzmed enclosure {6) to my letter Ho. 103/of the l&amp;th March. Monsieur Laronce is correct in hi» statement that owner Ho. 6 , Salem ben Bkhnt aoe« not come to Muscat.

The negotiations between Monsieur Laronce, French Consul at Muscat and Major Grey, His Majesty's Cons’ll, relative to the application and interpretation of the Award of August 8th, 1905, appeared to have settled the difficulties which had originally arisen. The French Government were, therefore, very anxious that HisMaj esty* s Government should accept the list of French dhow-owners drawn up by their Consul and de livered to the British Consul on the 4th ultimo. Monsieur Geoffray added that Monsieur Laronce had inserted in this document the names of certain Arabs who were included in the Agreement signed at tfis Excellency The Right Honourable Sir F.

In my opinion the Sultan should go himself and enquire personally pressing the owners for a reply if necessary, but he will not do this without the promise of our support.

I do not think we should a^ree to the consideration of any protege or any dhow not naxned in the French list presented to the Hayue Tribunal. As regards the ^rabs included in that list the French Government should be required to establish to the satisfaction of the Sultan of Maskat and ourselves the title preach individual to be included within one of the categories held by the’Tribunal to carry riyht to fly flay. n he muabers and nfiiaes of dhows claimed on behalf of each in the French list above-mentioned might be conceded in the Cfise of those whose titles are duly established , if Government do not consider it advisable to ask French Consul to produce documentary evidence or to quote the dates of the ^irst registration of dhows. Me might even concede the right to renew dhows during the life-time of the present owners. I do not,' however, consider that adequate reasonreason has been shown why we should dispense with all invest!- u &gt; f ^ Ration of the title to^proteges, especially seeing that Mr, *1 H. Graham considers that only 10 proteges out of 05 would survive the ordeal and Grey expects much fewer. It is most important that the number of persons subject to French influence should be reduced to the smallest possible limit if we wish to promote the interests of the Sultan of Meskat at Sur, and in order to further that end the contingency of the prolongation of the negotiations at Llaskat would appear, comparatiyely speaking, to be of little importance.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to telegram, ITo. SSb-F.B., Gated loth instant, from the Government of inGia in the Foreign Pepartment, and to this office letter ITo. 313, dated 18th June 1900, which was forwarded to Government by lieutenant Colonel Kemball with his letter JTo. 180, dated 30th idem. 3. . In paragraph 5 of the letter to which attention is invited my predecessor states on the authority of His Highness the Sultan, that the French fl&amp;£ holders received no protection papers beyond the titres de navigation. His Highness assures me that these titres were in fact the only authorisation papers ever issued to them. According to Monsieur Laronee, whenever an Arab presented himself at a French Consulate or colonial office and asked for a flat, and titre de navigation, he was ^.iven them on payment of the sum demanded, provided that he satisfied the conditions specified by Major Cox in the same paragraphparagraph of his letter. Should the applicant already have been in possession of a titre for one vessel, he was ^ranted one for another without question, his name having been regis tered as a French 'protege' on his first application. These titres de navigation were renewed yearly, as a rule at the office from which the original had been obtained; but, in the event of the owner or master of a dhow being unable to appear at that office on the expiry of the year, upon his presenting himself at another colony or Consulate, either fl) a note of 'prolongation' was made on the reverse of his titre to cover the period re quired for him to reach his 'port d*attache' (vide enclosure 8 to Major Cox f s letter under reference), (C) the same titre was m^de tenable for another year, or (3) a 'renouvellement' was given by the officer in charge of the colonial oi Consular office at which the applicant appeared. T enquired from Monsieur laronce as to the view taken in cases where the owner or master of a* dhow had either neglected, eux'. I su L?' gested then that in such a case should the dhow that cer tainlv he would, if he could produce his old paper. oror at least prove that he was a French 'protege' ! It is weir heie to notice briefly the issue of titre number II. Z (enclosure 8 to Major Cox’s letter). My predecessor rejiarxs that Has^nd 0121 Khariis riust iiave had French papers before and let theia lapse, thereby reverting to his original status as a subject of tlie Sultan of Oman• he rriay have let his titre lapse, out f 1 o.p. the rronch point of view the fact of his having done so would not have affected his status as a protege. ^• Cur diificulty then is that it is impossible to ascertain where and when each owner first obtained his registration as a French protege and authorisation to fly the flag except from the French colonial and Consular records themselves, as ail the titres de navigation granted before 1892 have long ceased to exist; and we are now paying the price of having allowed this abuse to remain for so lon 0 practically uncontested. 4. In regard to the replacement of existing dhows by authorised flagholders, I suggest that, now that there is a prospect of the number and names of such persons being definitely established, that all question of their possessing any right of exterritoriality which would exempt them from the jurisdiction of their lawful sovereign has been removed, and that the authori sations, at the most, are peculiar to the persons concerned during their lifetime only and are not to be inherited, it does not seem to matter very much, either from the point of view ofHis Highness the Sultan, or from that of His Majesty's Govern ment, whether the authorisation is held to he general, and a limited number of dhows allowed to be maintained and replaced during the lifetime of each owner, or whether the authorisation is held to be strictly limited to specifiddhowe* Hot onl^ does a dhow ordinarily last for a lir.rge number of years, but it must be remembered that it would be extremely difficult for His Highness to prove to the satisfaction of the French Consul that any particular vessel had ceased to exist and had been replaced. Hvery effort would be made not only by the owner himself but also by the French officials on his behalf to conceal the fc.ct, and it would not be likely that the Sultan would cz-re to proceed against the owner without substantial proof of his guilt, ^or more reasons then one. On the other hand the death of an owner is impossible to conceal for any A length of time, and His Highness would have no difficulty in punishing any subject of his in whose possession one of the deceased man's dhows was found should it be sailing under a French flag. For these as well as other reasons, I beg res pectfully to reiterate the suggestion submittso for considera tion in my telegram of January 4th. 5. Monsieur Laronce informs me that he has not yet received all the information respecting tne French list which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said was still awaited1 awaited so long a^o as TToveiiber 8th. If Kis Majesf, Government are prepared to accept the list put in hy th French with their counter ease before the Hague Tribunal practically as it stands, it will not be necessary to wait for further information and much time will be saved. it i unlikely that any names will be eliminated by the French, who aiter ^king all possible delay, will produce documentary evidence to support the claim of each owner to authorisation. Otherwise, I be^ to su 0 ^est that the French Government be pressed to expedite the collection of the required parti culars, as the proclamation to be issued by the Sultan should contain an accepted list, and the French are quite aware of the fact that they have nothing to lose by delaying the issue of the proclamation. Monsieur laronce remarked to me that there are some dhow owners possessing authorisation to fly the French flag whose names are not in the list referred to above. I trust that it win be possible to decline to allow the claims of such persons to be considered.The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. Sir I have laid before Secretary Sir E. Grey your letter of the 19th ultimo on the subject of the negotiations between the British and French Consuls at Muscat for the carrying into effect of the receir Arbitration Award. With regard to the points of difference between the two Consuls, Sir E. Grey concurs in the terms of the reply which the Government of India propose to return to Major Grey respecting points 1 and 2, As regards point 3, via: the French claim to jurisdiction in Muscat over an Omani accused of hav ing committed a crime on the high seas while sailing in a dhow flying the French flag. Sir E. Grey is ad vised as follows:- If the Omni in question leaves the ship and proceeds on shore he comes at once under the juris- -hie Under Secretary of State, India Office.( 3 3 J jurisdiction of the Sultan and is not justiciable hj the French Consul, On the other hand the Sultan., and therefore His Majesty’s Government has no valid round of complaint if, without being landed, he is transhipped for trial at Obokh or some other place within French territory, nor would it be reasonable to object if the man were merely landed so as to enable the French Consul to make arrangements for his being sent for trial before a Court in French terri tory. Objection should, however, be taken to his being tried by the French Consul at Muscat. Sir E. Grey would propose, if Mr. Secretary Morley concurs, that His Majesty's Consul should be authorised to inform his French colleague of the con* Lusions arrived at by His Majesty's Government on the three points at issue, and to endeavour to ef fect a settlement on the lines laid down. No previcareful consideration, and I am directed t&gt;y Sir E. Grey to state that he considers that it would he quite useless at present to approach the French Government in the matter, unless His Majesty's Gov ernment were prepared to offer them some consider able equivalent elsewhere. In some years time, when the gradual disappearance of the French flagholders will have reduced French interests in Muscat to a minimum, the proposal might possibly be put forward more opportunely and with greater chances of French acquiescence. i I am.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta, Dated - the 27th. Reed, - the 28th December 1905. Please refer to the Political Agent, Muscat’s letter Do,568, dated the 16th December 1905. Even if the Agreement of the 13th May 1904 exists, it is not operative against the Sultan of Muscat unless he was consulted. Moreover, out of the six men mentioned by Major Grey, four can be identified with the names in the lists of Soori flagholders obtained by our representatives at Muscat in 1891, 1894, 1899, and 1901, and the remain5.ng two can in all probability be identified on learning their grandfather’s ■ names. I venture to recommend that the Sultan of. Muscat be advised to refuse recognition of these - please see ray telegram Do. 700 - as Zanzibaris and that he should claim full investigation of their nationality before accepting the Agreement of May 1904. The place Bokin or Bokeen, mentioned in the Political Agent, Muscat’s letter referred to above, is not in Zanzibar but in Madagascar,Heed, the 28th December 1905, Please refer to your telegram K0.4625-E.S,, dated the 13th instant. Regarding the question of dhows owned by one protege, the second half of the second article of the Award read with the jlfi remark in Lr.Ronald Graham’s despatch Ho.9 of the 8th August seems to make it clear that authorisations are limited to those dhows names as v. in the French list before the Tribune, that is to say, dhows 'ell as proteges are limited by the Award. I hope this position can be maintained by us. As regards the second and third points refeneo ~o, generally speaking, the effect of the Award clearly is that French jurisdiction ceases dir ectly a pr otege puts foot__on_ 3 }K)re anu it is important that this hard and fast line which is easily grasped hy Arabs, should be rigidly preserved. If however the principle that jurisdiction for an offence comcitted at sea follows the flag flown ! by a vessel, is considered difficult to dispute, then we mightV stipulate that if Consul wants to exercise jurisdiction he must proceed on hoard and do it, Referring now to Major Grey’s demi- official telegram, we must undoubtedly give and take on points of difference in interpreting Award, hut it is incumbent on us to consult the Sultan all through and I do not think we should go outside case for material for gguid pro quo . If the slightest hint regarding the desire for a British Protectorate were dropped before the negotiations for the execution of the Award were completed, it would, in my opinion, be premature and would lay our good faith in this flag question open to suspicion, ab initio both before the Sultan of Muscat and French Government, Addressed to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta.

Grant of French Flags to , Muscat Dhows. IN 1844 a Treaty was concluded between France and Muscat, whereby French subjects en joyed, as regards their person and property, rights of exterritoriality in Muscat. These rights were extended to their servants, even if subjects of the Sultan. By a Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat concluded in 1891, similar rights and the most favoured-nation treatment were secured for British subjects in Muscat. On the 10th March, 1862, Great Britain and France signed a Declaration engaging reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultan of Muscat. France has always refused to permit the exer cise by the warships of any other Power of the droit de visite on the high seas as regards ships carrying the French flag, and, by only partially ratifying the Brussels General Act in 1892, she preserved this claim to resist the right of search. Arabs concerned in the oversea Slave Trade are fully aware of this policy, and have sought to ob tain the benefit of the French flag, and thus avoid detention and search on the high seas, either h J hoisting it without authority, or by obtaining permission to hoist it from French Consuls in the Eastern Seas, or from the authorities in French Colonies and Protectorates. The French officials in Obokh, Madagascar, and the Comoros have granted, from time to [201] B✓ :.2 time, French ships’ papers and flags to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and the same course has been taken by the French Consuls at Aden, Muscat, and Zanzibar. Most of the Omanis who thus received French papers belonged to the dis trict of Jalani and the town of Sur, within Muscat territories. These men were neither of French nationality nor naturalization; they had no authority from their Sultan fio change their alle giance, and they hail no permanent residence or settlement m French territory, but merely paid fleeting visits thereto for the purpose of renewing their licences. Many of these flagholders engaged in the Slave Trade. Moreover, on returning to the waters and territory of Muscat, they claimed that the Sultan was not entitled to board or search their vessels, or to exercise any jurisdiction over them, and that they were entitled to be treated as French proteges, and to be exempt from his laws as regards cus toms, quarantine, and other matters. The Sultan of Muscat never admitted that the grant of French flags or papers was warranted by Treaty or usage, and made repeated protests on the subject. He appealed to His Majesty’s Government, who on several occasions made representations to the French Government. In 1899 His Highness visited Sur, and persuaded the French flagholders to sign an undertaking to give up their papers. Four sets of papers were actually surrendered and were sent to the French Consul, but he declined to receive them. The question formed the subject of further discussion between the British and French Governments, and, in June ] 900, the French Ambassador in London gave an assurance that from that date no fresh papers would be issued to Muscat subjects. There matters rested until they were brought to a head by two incidents which occurred in 1903. A French flagholder named Mubarak, a subject of the Sultan, in order to avoid a fine levied on the town of Sur, persisted in taking his dhow out of the harbour in spite of orders to the contrary. The vessel was fired upon, and a shot went through its flag. The French Consul made this incident the ground for a claim on the Sultan for an indemnity of 1,500 dollars. The claim was challenged by the British Consul, and was with drawn or postponed. -a?On the 8th April, 1903, five Arabs, natives of Sur, arrived at Muscat on the British mail- steamer from Bombay. Bombay being an infected port the men were placed in quarantine. The following day, however, they broke quarantine and escaped from Muscat in a sailing boat. The Sultan at once communicated with his Health Officer and His Majesty’s Consul. The steam- launch of His Majesty’s ship “ Perseus ” was dispatched after the fugitives, overtook them and brought them back to Muscat, where they were taken back to the quarantine station. On the 11th April the French Consul claimed the release of the five Arabs as being Suris under French protection. The Sultan replied that he intended to punish them for breaking quarantine, and repeated his protest against the contention that the French flag covered any of his subjects while in his territory or territorial waters. On the 15th April the men were tried and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. An acute crisis supervened. The Sultan’s action was supported by His Majesty’s Govern ment, but was challenged by the French Consul and the Commander of the French war-ship “ Internet.” The latter, after a violent scene with the Sultan, threw his sword on the table and told His Highness to choose between that and the release of the five prisoners. Finally, it was decided that this incident and the whole question of the grant of French flags to subjects of the Sultan should be submitted to the arbitration of the International Court at The Hague. The following two points were submitted to the decision of the Tribunal, which met at The Hague on the 24th July, 1905 :— (a.) The scope of the reciprocal Declaration made by Great Britain and France in 1862 in relation to the issue by France to subjects of the Sultan of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag; and (b.) The nature of the privileges and immu nities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who were owners or masters of dhows and possessed French papers, or were members of the crew of such dhows, and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affected the jurisdiction of His Highness over his said subjects.His Majesty’s Government submitted that 1. No subject of the Sultan acquired the status oi a French protege by the iact of being the owner, captain, or member of the crew of a dhow which had obtained French papers or flag. 2. By her adhesion to Article 32 of the Brussels Act, France was bound not to give French flags or papers to any native vessel unless its owner was a bond fide French citizen or protege. 3. France was equally debarred by the Decla ration of 1862 from withdrawing any subject of the Sultan from His Highness jurisdiction by the grant of French flags and papers, and such a practice trenched on His Highness’ independence. 4. No subject of the Sultan, by accepting French papers or flags, acquired for himself, or his crew or family, immunity from the Sultan s juris diction in Muscat territories or waters. 5 and 6. The French litres de navigation were not transferable from one owner to another, or from one dhow to another. 7. France should erase from her registers all vessels owned by subjects of the Sultan, and obtain the surrender of their flags and papers. 8. In cases where France claimed any Omani owner, or captain, or sailor as a French protdge, she should furnish proofs to the Sultan in support of her claim. The French Government contended— IT That France had in no way infringed the Declaration of 1862 by the grant of French flags or papers, or by forcing the Sultan to respect the Treat 3 r of 1844, and that the status quo should be maintained. The Award of the Tribunal was delivered on the .8th August, 1905, and ran as follows :—- As regards (a)— “ 1. Before the 2nd January, 1892, France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and adminis trative Rules.” The date in question is that of the ratification of the Brussels Act, the Court holding that France was, in relation to Great Britain, bound to grant her flag only under the conditions pre scribed by Article 32 of that Act.IS/' 5 “ 2. Owners of dhows, who before 1892 had been authorized by France to fly the French flag, retained this authorization as long as France renewed it to the grantee. “ 3. After the 2nd January, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the Frencli flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by (France as her proteges before the year 1863.” The year 1863 was taken as the date at which, in virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Porte, and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new protegds was regulated and limited. As regards (/&gt;)— “ 1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled, in the territorial waters of Muscat, to the inviolability provided by the French- Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844. “2. The authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even [if belonging to the same owner. “3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy, in conse quence of that fact, any right of exterritoriality which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan ot Muscat.” The results of the Award may be summarized as follows :— France may renew the licences to fly the French flag granted to owners of dhows before the 2nd January, 1892. But no licences given since that date are valid unless the grantee was a bond fide French protege before 1863. This decision will, it is believed, reduce the number of French flagholders to ten or twelve at the utmost. Moreover, under Article 2 of (b), the licences in question cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. Thus, it would appear that if one of the licensed dhows were to be lost or disabled, the owner, in order to obtain a new licence, must prove that he comes under the category of those who were bond fide French proteges before 1863. Such proteges must now [201] C6 be scarce, and the number of French flagholders should, in the course of a few years, be reduced to vanishing point. Under Article 1 of (b) dhows hying the French flag are declared to be inviolable in Muscat waters, and thus they are exempt from search. This decision is regrettable in view of the active participation of such dhows in the Slave Trade. But under Article 3 of (b) the owners, masters, and crews of the dhows, or their families, are expressly declared not to enjoy any such inviolability, and the moment they set foot in Muscat territory they come under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Sultan. The Tribunal has definitely laid down that the withdrawal of such persons from the Sultan’s sovereignty and juris diction would be in contradiction with the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862. This important decision afforded much satisfaction to the Sultan, and determined, entirely? in His Highness’ favour, the controversy regarding the French-protected Suris who broke quarantine in April 1903, the incident which in reality gave rise to the arbitration. On the 22nd August the French Government stated that M. Laronce, the French Consul at Muscat, was returning to his post armed with the necessary instructions to carry out the terms of the Award. Pending his arrival, the status quo would be maintained, and temporary renewals of their licences had been granted to the French flagholders. We concurred, but pointed out that the maintenance of the status quo could not affect the immediate coming into operation of the final clause of the Award, and that the flagholders had now come, as a matter of course, under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Sultan. To this the French Government agreed, making, however, an exception in favour of those flagholders who should eventually establish a claim to be bond fide French citizens. In October last we proposed to the French Government that the British and French Consuls, who had already been instructed to cultivate most friendly relations and co-operate loyally to obtain a settlement, should lie autho rized to confer together as to (I) the best method of making known the results of the arbitration to the subjects [of the Sultan, and (_j) the compilation of a list of such subjects who are still entitled to fly the French flag. TheiMBMHMNHI result of this conference to be referred by the two Consuls to their respective Governments for approval. The French Government agreed, and instruc tions have been sent to Major Grey and M. Laronce accordingly. R G.
