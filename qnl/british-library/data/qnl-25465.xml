Does 'existing basis' mean, the basis of the cost since, or before Asst#Surgeon Johnstone^ departure in May? If the former, presumably there is only a negligible di fference between the actual and proposed scales and all that is required is formal sanction for continuing the post, in a skeleton style, beyond the actual date sanctioned# As regards the Motor Launch possibly it might be as well to ask the Director General of Stores to verify Messrs. Thornycroft’s estimate of cost, given in January last, and to enquire whether a similar vessel migfrt not be obtained more cheaply from the Disposals Board from among the Naval Motor Launch^ surplus &amp; requirements. (Sd.) H. MONTEATH. 2.X. 20. Political Secretary, As you observe, the last three paragraphs of the despatch are a little obscure; I think that the Government of India mean that the provision of a Motor Launch is a ♦ condition precedent for determining the Vice-Consulate; they wont abandon the one, until they have got the other. It is, however, simply the potential rigjit to fill the post that is in question; the post is vacant, I understand, end will so continue - just as, for the matter of that, it * was vacant for 15 months or so in 1915-6; vide the Government of India’s telegram of 21st August 1916.

No. 383 Finance Department dated 12th August 1920. / / Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to forward to be laid before Earl Curzon of Kedleston a copy of the marginally noted letter in which the * &lt; Government of India recommend the abolition of the post of Vice Consul at Lingah, the transference of the charge of British interests at Lingah to H.B.M. Consul at Bunder Abbas, and the provision of a sea-going motor launch for the latter officer to enable him efficiently to carry out, not only the duties which it is now proposed should be transferred to him, &lt; * * but those normally pertaining to his appointment The provision of a sea-going launch for the Consul at Bunder Abbas was recommended by the Government of India as a necessity, in June 1914, but the outbreak of war prevented consideration of the question from being pursued (vide correspondence ending with Sir A. Law’s letter No. 39371 of 26th August 1914). It will be observed that the Government of India estimate that after allowing for the reduction of expenditure at Lingah by the abolition of the post of Vice Consul, the annual recurring expenditure on the Establishments at Bunder Abbas and Lingah will be increased by Rs.11,106 in addition to the initial cost of providing the launch. Having regard however to the fact that sooner or later the provision of a launch of the type in question would prove to be a necessity for the Bunder Abbas Consulate, the Secretary of State in Council considers that the Government of The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. India’sIndia's proposals not only make for increased efficiency but are in themselves essentially economical: he therefore o commends them to the favourable consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and trusts that The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will agree to accept as a charge on Imperial Revenues a moiety of the expenditure involved, both initial and recurring. Pending the receipt of a reply, Mr. Secretary Montagu is Causing enquiries to be made whether Messrs. Thornycroft*a estimate, furnished in January, still holds good, and whether a suitable vesser could be obtained at less expense from among Naval vessels surplus to requirements. I have, etc., J.I.

To The Right Honourable EDWIN MONTAGU, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 12th August 1920. Sir We have the honour to refer to Mr. Chamberlain’s telegram, dated the 29th May 1916, in which sanction was given to the retention of the Vice- Consulate at Lingah for a period of three years with effect from the 1st April 1916, and to recommend . , ,, , , r , , (a \ tlia t the appointment of Vice-Consul at Lingah should be abolished ( ' and that British interests in Lingah should be placed in the charge of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas, and ,b) that a sea-going launch should be provided for His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas. 2 The Vice-Consulate at Linejah was established largely with a view to checking German fctrigue at Lingah and in the neighbourhood and to prevent ing the Germans from making use of Lmgah as a base for intrigue on t o Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. , m With the temporary disappearance of German and Turkish power the maintenance of a Vice-Consulate is no longer necessary, but .t is desirable ^at affairs at Lingah should be under the immediate supervision of a British fomsular 'officer, as^he old arrangement of maintaining a Persian Agent was Therefore considerable British commercial interests in Lingah; a wireless installation is maintained pending the construction of a lan^ telegraph h from Bandar Abbas to Lingah and the quarantine arrangements are under our supervision. recommen d that British interests in Lingah shall be We, thereior , r Maiestv’s Consul at Bandar Abbas and that mCS SSI Consul .1 Bandar Abbaa d.rin S b» ™.» 1» 1 .jb A »a Jon. is ...l«.d ^ Statement A. be a monthly saving of Rs. 774-8-0. 4 We further have the honour to refer to Lord Crewe’s despatch no. 104-Political, dated the 11th September 1914, that our proposal to supply a new steam launc or m. Consul at Bandar Abbas should be postponed owing to the war. Ther* arguments which we then put forward in support of our proposal to supply a launch for the use of His BritannitK Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas still hold good and have, in fact, become of greater cogency in view of our increased responsibility for assisting the Persian Government under our new agreement and, also, owing to the finding of oil on Qishm Island. Moreover, our proposal to abolish the post of Vice-Consul at Lingah is dependent on the provision of a suitable sea-going launch for His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas, which will enable him to visit Lingah at any time. 5. We wish, however, to modify our proposals to the extent of substi tuting a launch driven by internal combustion engines for the steam launch previously asked for. In doing so we are moved by two considerations, firstly, the urgent necessity for all possible economy and, secondly, the great strides which have been made of recent years in the construction of motor boats, which, if reliable, have considerable advantages over steam driven craft. 6. During a recent tour in the Persian Gulf the Director of Royal Indian Marine discussed the question of a launch with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas and they agreed that the requirements of B is llritannic Majesty’s Consul will be met by the provision of a Thornycroft 16 —'iO h. p. launch, the abridged specification of which is given in the following extract from a letter from Messrs. John I. Thornycroft &amp; Co., Ltd., 10, Grosvenor Place, London, S. W. 1, to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas, No. W. F. H./R. S./1771, dated the 19th January 1920:— “ 4. Design No. 17766 Standard 45-ft. Sea-going cabin cruiser, built of teak, copper sheathed, fitted with Z/6 type motor, speed about 12 knots, approximate price including electric starter and electric lighting, about £3,250, delivered at building yard, delivery in about five months from date of receipt of order.” We had under consideration the purchase of a faster launch, which was first recommended by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and offered by Messrs. Saunders &amp; Co., Ltd., for £6,750, but our local officers are prepared to accept a launch with a speed of 12 knots and in view of this and for reasons of economy we recommend the purchase of the Thornycroft launch, the cost of which at the works is £3,250, provided that the Company will guarantee a working speed of not less than 12 knots. There will also be the cost of freight to Bandar Ablas, the amount of w hich cannot he exactly determined. 7. We estimate that the cost of upkeep, including crew’s wages, running statement b. expenses and repairs, will amount to Rs. 1,700 a month (details of which are shown in the attached statement) or Rs. 20,400 a year. Taking into consideration the savings of Rs. 9,294 a year due to the abolition of the post of Vice-Consul at Lingah, the total extra expenditure will be— (a) initial ... £3,250 plus freight, (b) recurring ... Rs. 11,106 a year, which is divisible between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. We, therefore, request you to obtain the consent of His Majesty’s Government to bear their share of the cost of these proposals, if approved. 8. If the proposals are sanctioned, we request that you will cause the order for the launch to be placed with Messrs. Thornycroft &amp; Co., Ltd., and that the latter may be asked to provide a very wide range of spare parts in view of the difficulty and delay in replacing any broken part in the Persian Gulf. 9. The sanction for the retention of the Vice-Consulate at Lingah expired on the 31st March 1919, but owing to the unsettled state of affairs ^n Persia and the necessity for a careful survey of the position before we could recommend the final abolition of the Vice-Consulate, considerable delay occurred in formulating our present proposals. We, therefore, request your sanction to the continuance of the Vice-Consulate at Lingah on its existing basis, until the date on which w r e are able to give effect to your decision pn pur present proposals.10. Recently Second Glass Assistant Surgeon J. G. Johnstone, O.B.E.s the Assistant Surgeon in charge of the quarantine arrangements, has held charge of the Vice-Consulate, but on his proceeding on leave in May 1920, we instructed His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas to take over charge of the Ling&amp;h Vice-Consulate in anticipation of your approval of the abolition of the post of Vice-Consul and made temporary arrangements for a launch to enable him to visit Lingah, when necessary. 11. We now request your sanction (а) to the continuance of the Vice-Consulate at Lingah on its existing basis till we can give effect to your orders on the present proposals; (б) to the abolition of the post of Vice-Consul at Lingah and to the retention of a, house and reduced establishment; and (c) to the provision of a motor launch for His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas. 12.

THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDWIN MONTAGU, Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Delhi, the 4th January 1918. Sir, With reference to your telegram, dated the 29th May 1916, sanction ing the retention of the appointment of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Lingah for a further period of three years from the 1st April 1916, we have the honour to report, for the information of His Majesty’s Government, that for the reasons * _ ^ ^ J given in the letter* from the Deputy ° py a ac e • Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 2285, dated the 22nd October 1917, in which we concur, we have sanction ed an expenditure of Rs. 750 for the year 1917-18, and provision for 1918-19 of Rs. 1,500, to meet the estimated telegraphic charges of the Lingah 1 Vice- Consulate, for those years. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servants, \No. 2285, dated Bushire, the 22nd October From— Major M. E. Eae ; First Assistant Resident (in the absence of the Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf), To— Denys Bray, Esq., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Politicbl Department. The wireless installation at Lingah has now made telegraphic communica tion with His Majesty’s Vice-Consul there possible. I have therefore the honour to address you on tbe subject of an allotment for telegraph purposes for the Lingah Vice-Consulate. The Lingah Vice-Consular office allowance is of course inadequate to meet telegraphic charges. These were not contemplated when it was fixed. I have the honour to suggest that in the first instance the allotment should be fixed at Es. 1,500 and that half of this sum should be provided for use this year. This sum will not be excessive. It may very probably prove inadequate. Bahrain has expended more than Es. 1,500 in the past half year and Lingah, though a post of less status, is more in tbe current of affairs at present. Pre sent political conditions and the slowness and irregularity of the mail service, as it now exists, necessitate heavy telegraphic expenditure at all posts. S. Q. P. I., Delhi—No. 635 F. i P.

Wood, Esq., C.I.E., To—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, I have the honour to submit copy of a note recorded by me on my recent; inspection of the Lingah Vice-Consulate, and to suggest that, subject to any re marks that may be made by the Political Resident at Bushire, the proposal made in paragraph 6 of the note regarding the increase of the sumptuary allowance may be sanctioned with effect from the beginning of the next financial year. 2. I have no other proposals to make regarding the Lingah allowances, and the total budget of the Vice-Consultate will not be afiected by the proposed addi tion to the sumptuary grant. 3. It will be observed that I strongly deprecate the discontinuance of the allowance of Rs. 50 a month at present paid to Khan Bahadur Agha Bedr, the Residency Agent at Lingah. 4. A copy of this letter (with enclosure) is being sent to the Political Resident at Bushire. I visited Lingah on the 4th and 5th March 1912. As the “ Lawrence ” was in quarantine, I was unable to land till the afternoon of the 5th, when I walked through the bazaar with Mr. New, the Vice-Consul, and Captain Birdwood, the Second Assistant at Bushire, and inspected the Vice-Consulate office. 2. The town has an extensive bazaar but owes its commercial importance chiefly to its connection with the pearl trade. Being a port of call for the fast mail service it is largely used by the pearl boats from Bahrain and Debai as a starting point for the export trade to Bombay. There is a representative of the German firm Wonckhaus and Company, living in the town, and the customs are managed by a Belgian official. ; ■ 3. The following statistics give some idea of the volume of work which passed through Mr. New's office during the last Work of the Vice-Consulate. tw() years Correspondence — Letters sent 1910 (231), 1911 (459). Letters received 1910 (456), 1911 (827). Vernacular letters sent and received 1911 (250). Weekly diaries sent 1911 (51), entries (739). Weekly diaries 1910 (41), entries (566). British subjects registered 1910 (76), 1911 (43). No. of files (65). No. of sub-files (50). Consular documents registered. Tezkereh passes issued from 1st September 1911 (51). Customs passes issued from 1st September 1911 (67). ; -42 The Vice-Consul also has to submit a number of returns through Bushire to the Foreign Office, London, as well as his weekly and monthly diaiies sent to the Resident at Bushire. The Consular business is not heavy, but there is a considerable amount of in telligence work in connection with the Arms Traffic Operations. 4. Mr. New’s appointment was sanc tioned* tentatively for 3 years which will expire on 29th March 1913, at a cost of Rs. 11,250 a year, viz. Rs. ... =6,000 .. = 750 =3,000 ... =1,500 Cost of the appointment. Contract Grants, for contingencies and establishment. * See Est., September 1910, Nos. 18-37. Salary £400 per annum - House allowance per annum £50 Contract Grant for establishment per annum £200 Contract Grant for contingencies per annum £100 Total 11,250 There was also an initial expenditure grant of £150 or Rs. 2,250. In September 1911, the Government of India sanctioned f a sumptuary al- ^ o . u mn xr 177 t 70 lowance of Rs. 50 only (the Resident having t Est. B„ September 1911, *os. 177.179. Rg ^ ^^ ^ ^ J be met from the Contract Grant already sanctioned. As a result of this, Mr. New’s Contract Grant for contingencies has been reduced from Rs. 125 to Rs. 75 per mensem. From this he meets all contingent expenditure including boat hire, telegrams, purchase of stationery, etc. From his establishment grant of Rs f 250 a month he pays for an establishment costing Rs. 212 a month including a clerk on Rs. 100 plus a house rent of Rs. 15 and a munshi on Rs. 50 a month. I do not think that he could manage with less. The accounts and records of his office are neatly and carefully kept and the clerk has his hands full with the preparation of the various reports and returns. 5. There seems to have been some misunderstanding as regards the intention of Government in regard to these Contract Grants. I take it that as the scale of allowances was fixed on the analogy of the Foreign Office Consulates, it was the intention of the Government that the allowances should be entirely at the disposal of the Vice-Consul who would spend them as he pleases subject to such control as the Resident at Bushire might wish to exercise. Whether this was the intention or not, I think that, in view of the exiguity of the allowances, it was the only reasonable system and should be adopted in future. As a matter of fact, however, the Vice-Consul, although he has drawn the full amount of his Con tract Grant month by month, and accumulated a cash balance of Rs. 1,304-13-10 as the result of 2 years’ working of the system, has scrupulously abstained from availing himself of this balance either for his own purposes or for the service .oJt the Vice-Consulate. He seems to have been under the impression that the unexpend ed balance at the end of each month lapsed to Government, although the actual cash remains in his own hand. This is ,1 imagine, an entirely erroneous impres sion. The Contract Allowances having been paid to him in full and the Comptrol ler, India Treasuries, having been informed that the money has been drawn, he is at liberty to spend his cash balance at his discretion subject to any orders that the Resident may give him. It is desirable that this matter should be set right without delay, as there are many things which the Vice-Consulate requires (e.g. a decent boat and uniform for the boatmen) but which have not been purchased owing to a misapprehension of the true position. The Resident can, I think, give the neces sary orders without referring to the Government of India. 6 . As regards the sumptuary allowance, I am not aware of the grounds on 0 „ which the Government of India modified sumptuary a owance. Resident’s proposal and ordered the re duced allowance of Rs. 50 a month to be met from the existing Contract Grant. Possibly it was in order to avoid the necessity for referring to the Secretary ot State. It seems clear that considering the position which Mr. New has to keep up as His Majesty’s representative at this important port and the amount of entertainment which he has to dispense to Naval officers and others, Rs. 50 is quite an inadequate ;C\allowance for his sumptuary expenses. There are at the present moment no less than 4 naval vessels at Lmgah (besides 2 mail ships and the “ Lawrence ”1 and it is quite certain that some of the officers will find their way to Mr New’s table in the course of their visit. It may be argued that it is not the business of Govern ment to contribute to such expenses. But m a place like Lingah, where the Vice- Consul is the only British official, it is inevitable that he should keep open house for any of his countrymen who may be unfortunate enough to be detained there I strongly recommend, therefore, that the Vice-Consul’s sumptuary allowance be increased to Rs 100 per mensem. If the Government of India so desire, it might be stipulated that for the next year at any rate the whole Rs. 100 should be met from the office allowance and not be treated as salary. The balance in the hands of the Vice-Consul at present should enable him to meet any deficiency in the Mis- cellaneous Grant for the next 12 months. J After that, the question of continuing the appointment on its present footing will come up for decision, and the position can be re-examined. 7. As desired by the Government of India, I enquired into the question of Residency Agent. ^ . reta ;^g * Residency Consul. Agent at Lingah in addition to the Vice- Frimd facie it would appear that one of these appointments must be superflu ous. But the circumstances are peculiar. Khan Bahadur Agha Bedr, the Resi dency Agent, is the biggest land and house-owner in Lmgah, and the most import ant local man in the place. He is invaluable to the Vice-Consul in the way of providing him with confidential information regarding locil movements and the attitude of the neighbouring tribes and acting as his agent in settling local disputes. He is the owner of the Vice-Consulate buildings and the Customs House. With out his assistance the Vice-Consul's position would be difficult, if not impossible, and his services are very cheaply secured by the payment of Rs. 50 a month. It would, in my opinion, be a grave mistake to disturb this arrangement. 8. Whether Mr. New's services should be retained after the expiry of the Question of continuing the Vice-Consulate period for which his appointment was after March 1913 . sanctioned it is somewhat premature to discuss. So long as the arms traffic continues and the Germans retain a Commer cial Agent at Lingah, I do not think that we can do without a British Officer at the port. Should the arms traffic be totally wiped out and German competition be removed, the possibility might be considered of combining the Bunder Abbas and Lingah appointments in the same hands. But I see no prospect of this contingency at present. If, as may be expected, it is found necessary to continue the Vice-Consulate after March 1913, it will probably be necessary to offer some slight pecuniary or other inducement to Mr. New to retain the billet, for which he is admirably suited both by character and experience.

Calcutta, the 14th March 1912. My Lord Marquis, We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Lord Morley s telegram, dated the 14th January 1910, regarding the establish ment, for three years, of a Vice-Consulate at Lingah, and to submit the follow ing case for your Lordship’s orders. 2. In connection with the establishment of the new Vice-Consulate at Lmgah, Mr. R. H. New, Vice-Consul, has experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining a suitable clerk at the rate of pay which he is in a position to offer, nt he has eventually succeeded in securing the services of one Kawasji Mirza, who holds a substantive appointment in the Post Office in India. Mr.^ Mirza accepted employment at Lingah on the assumption that his I service there would be pensionable. This assumption, however, was incorrect, * since under Article 365, Civil Service Regulations, service on the Vice-Con- \ sul’s establishment, which is paid from a contract allowance, does not qualify or pension. Mr. Mirza, who is a graduate of the Bombay University and has b od knowledge of Persian, is reported to be an efficient clerk and is of § assistance to Mr. New, who is consequently most anxious to retain his services. Unless, however, the provisions of the article quoted above are re axed, Mr. Mirza will be compelled to revert to service under the Post c 0} in order to safeguard his pensionary prospects.) r;! 3. In these circumstances, we would request that, as a special case, Mr. Mirza’s service, while he is employed at Lingah, may be allowed to qualify for pension, on payment by him of a suitable pension contribution. We have the honour to be, My Lord Marquis, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servants, Ms 0 Mi I / (Signed) » v&gt; HARDINGE of PENSHURST. O’M. CREAGH. GUY FLEETWOOD WILSON, R. W. CARLYLE. S. H.

I nave the honour to make the following representation on 1 ,M 'behalf of Mr. R. H. New, H. M*s. Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Lingah. 2. He finds that, whereas his emoluments at present are practically the same as that he used to receive in his late appoint ment din the Telegraph Department, the expenses he has to incur in order to maintain in a fitting manner his position asBritish Representative at Lingah are considerably greater. Mr. New laid his circumstances before me some months ago but in view of recent orders for the maintenance of strict economy I endeavoured to avoid addressing Government. Mr. New has however again approached me on the subject and the position is t- such that I do not think it would be fair to him to delay further a reference to higher authority. 3. He urges that the entertaining he has to do presses veryvery heavily on his limited resources, and instances, inter alia, the constant calls made at Lingah by His Majesty 1 s Ships and Ships of the Royal Indian Marine* Thus, it will be seen from his Administration Report for the last year, that as many as 78 calls were made by Government vessels (including one of 23 days fl HJ duration) between April and December 1910* Mr. Hew further points out that the recent change in British India Steam Navigation |H Company* s ti^^table by which fast mail steamers now call at Lingah has led to a very considerable increase in the numbers of European passengers arriving at Lingah in order to make connection j » with the fast mail to Bombay and to all these H. M*s. Represent ative is more or less compelled to extend hospitality. 4. In the circumstances above explained, I consider that some relief in the form of sumptuary allowance is due to Mr. Hew, and therefore respectfully suggest that a sumptuary allowance ^ of Rs. 100/- per mensem may be granted to him.

The present Residency Agent is an excellent spe cimen of his class, and looks after British Subjects and protected persons with .much energy, but ho cannot be of much service in regard to trade matters. In view of his ability it 1b suggested that he should be retained us native assistant to the Consular Officer, to whom his services would be of very considerable utility. The Board of Trade have been consulted with regard to the suggested creation of the post, and have expressed themselves in favour of it, stat ing that the entrances and clearances of shipping at the port show a tendency to increase, the total ship ping dealt with In 1506 being Two hundred and seventy-* four thousand tons, of which amount Two hundred and Thirty thousand tons ware British.

Copy of a despatch the Government of India in which these estimates are set forth in detail is enclosed* The Government of India have agreed that half th# expenses of the post shall be net from Indian Revenue, and Sir E.

Langley’s letter of the 5th instant (27785/09) respecting the creation of a British Vice Consu late at Lingali in the Persian Gulf The proposal is recommended on grounds of German com mercial activity and competition.

They have no information as to the commercial import ance of Lingali beyond the statistics of shipping tonnage for 1906 furnished in the letter under reply, but these latterlatter do not. appear to show that at that date British trade in the port stood in need of immediate consular as sistance. In view of the numerous additions to the Consular establishment which have recently been made % Lords would earnestly press upon the Secretary of State the necessity of very caieful reconsideration of the exigencies of the present case. I am &amp;c., (Signed) G-.H. Murray.Thb Right Hon’ele VISCOUNT MORLEY op BLACKBURN, O.M., Eh Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 5th 1909. My Lord, With reference to our despatch No. 97, dated 3rd June 1909, on the subject of the appointment of a Yiee-Consul at Lingah, we have the honour to No. 1258 , dated the 29 th May 1909 . forward, for Your Lordship’s consideration No. 1259 , dated the 29 th May 1909 . ^ CO pi es of the correspondence cited on the* margin in which the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf recommends certain modifications in the Consular jurisdiction and status of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas. 2. The proposals which were approved in Mr. Brodrick’s despatch No. 27, dated 3rd June 1904, were that the status of the Consular Officer at Bunder Abbas should be raised to that of Consul and that he should be given jurisdic tion in the Shamilat^ Lingah and the Skib Kuh ports, Minab and the coast of Persia east as far as Gwettur, and in all the islands belonging to Persia in the eastern part of the Persian Gulf. His political charge was to include Has Musandim and the possessions and dependencies of the Jovvasmi tribe on or off the Arabian coast, as well as the British station at Bassidore. 3. Major Cox now recommends that the status of the British Consular Bepresentative at Bunder Abbas should be reduced to that of Vice-Consul, but that for the present he should retain the personal rank of Consul; that his Consular jurisdiction should be limited to Bunder Abbas up to the Khamir boundary on the west, the districts of Shamilat and Minab on the east, and the islands of Hormuz, Larak, Kishm, and Henjam in the eastern part of the Persian Gulf. The Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs, as Assistant to the Political Besident, will continue to hold political charge of the Persian-Mekran coast, the Consular jurisdiction over which will in future be exercised when necessary by the Political Besident. If this arrangement be approved, the western portion of the present Bunder Abbas charge, viz., Lingah, the Sliib Kuh ports, and the Persian islands above Lingah (viz., Parur, Kais, Hindarabi, and Sheikh Shuaib) will form and be included in the Consular jurisdiction of the Vice-Consul at Lingah, who should be directly subordinate to the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf. 4. Major Cox further suggests that the consular representative at Bunder Abbas shall no longer be entrusted ex-officio with political relations with the Oman coast and islands belonging to the Trucial Chiefs, provision for which can more advantageously be made by gazetting the Vice-Consuls at Lingah and Bunder Abbas as Assistants to the Besident in the Persian Gulf. This arrangement will enable the Political Besident to depute either officer to any portion of his charge as occasion arises.5. There is in our opinion much force in the arguments which Major Cox has advanced in support of these modifications. We desire to express our concurrence in his views and to request that, with Your Lordship’s approval, the necessary steps may he taken to give effect to them. We have the honour to he, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, ^ 0.nit iW) No. 1258 , dated Bushire, the 2 9 th May (received 7 th June) 1909 . From— Major P. Z.

I have been intending to make representations on this subject for some time past, and as the proposed appointment of a British Officer to Lffioah now under contemplation, will, if ,t eventually takes shape, affect the jurisdiction of the thefosidon P ° St ’ PreSent JUnCtUre SeemS 3 C0 ' Venient 'view o? ment 2 at T L G d 0 er e AhTf ° f perha P s remember th ^ when the appoint- ^ d .u .k . ba . s w , a3 created ln '900 as a temporary measure it was end- owed with he status of a Vice-Consulate only and that [he exequatur of [he wfn at Bund P e P r 0 M e hl' nC H U i ed YeZd ’ ^ he ‘ dea bein g that he ^ t!m winter at Bunder Abbas and the summer in the hills above Yezd. A little later on it was decided to make the appointment a permanent one and to include Lmph m Us junsdmUon ; the Consular sphere of the Resident in the Persian thn&lt;! P be h 1 g at tlme 80 as t0 embrace Laristan and Yezd, and ment b 6 ^ ReSldent m hls Consular capacity to supervise the new appoint- ho 'J ev ?, r ’ o f . fre f sh proposals submitted by my predecessor Colonel thA R V 1 A a ki deCld u d ln J une l 9°4 to eliminate Yezdand part of Laristan from the Bunder Abbas sphere but to add to it the Shamilat district in the vicinity of the port, Lingah andthe Shibkuh ports (west of Lingah); Minab, the most easi ly district of Persian Persia; the coast of Persian Baluchistan as far as Persian r ( 3 ulf aSt &amp; ^ lsIai)ds belon S in S t0 Persia in the eastern part of the 3 . In view of this greatly enhanced jurisdiction, and also, if I am not mis taken, with the idea of encouraging senior men to take the post and of giving the incumbent adequate precedence in questions of status and ceremonial, vis-a-vis the Russian representative then about to be appointed, the rank of the post was raised to that of a full Consulate, and as such no longer remained subordinate to the Consulate-General at Bushire. (I may mention that it was decided incidentally at the same time that the incumbent should in his capacity of a political officer of the Government of India nave charge of certain portions of the Arabian Coast opposite ; but this is an independent question with which I am dealing separately.) 4-' The above arrangements were proposed by my predecessor just before he relinquished charge at Bushire; the working experience of them has fallen entirely within my tenure of the appointment. During the five years which have passed it has, on the one hand, been demon strated that our representative at Bunder Abbas cannot in practice, handle the 5 ?tensive^ sphere allotted to him ; and, on the other hand, during the same period the political situation has been modified considerably both as regards the Persian and the Arab Coast in question, so that it is equally advisable from a political as well as an administrative point of view that the position should be reconsidered. 5 * I beg to refer first to the western portion of the present Bunder Abbas sphere; namely Lingah, the Shibkuh ports, and the Persian islands above Lingah. The administration of Lingah and appanages is controlled from Bushire. Thus the Deputy-Governor and Foreign Office Agent receive their appointments from the Governor and Karguzar at Bushire and work in direct communication with them and not through Bunder Abbas; similarly the Director of Customs is subordinate to Bushire. All matters regarding the claims and treatment of British subjects, or disputes wfith the Customs which cannot be settled locally, have to be discussed between the Residency and the local authorities at Bushire, In like manner, the German Firm of Wonckhaus &amp; Co., between whom and British merchants, or the British India Company, commercial disputes from time iat Bunder Abbas sends his Trade Returns direct to the Foreign Office, it would be much more convenient, now that the Consul-General at Bushire has a Vice- Consul of the Foreign Office especially attached to him for the study of the trade of Bushire and the Gulf Ports, that the commercial problems of Bunder Abbas and Lingah (and for that matter of Mohammerah) should in the first instance be focussed at Bushire. 8 . But while advocating the reversion of the status of the appointment to that of a Vice-Consulate it is not my wish that our representative should neces sarily be deprived of the local rank of Consul. There are at present at all events definite advantages in his retaining that personal rank. In the first place when calling on men-of-war it entitles him to a salute which it is advisable that he should have, and which, as Vice-Consul, he wmuld not get except by special dis pensation ; and secondly, as long as the Russian Government maintain a Consul at Bunder Abbas it is necessary that we should do likewise. In this connection, however, I may remark that it seems improbable that the Russian Government will continue to maintain a European representative there, in fact I heard informally a few months ago that they were believed to contemplate reducing the status of their Consulate-General at Bushire, placing a Consul in charge of their interests in the Gulf, assisted by native Consular Agents at Lingah and Bunder Abbas. The position then would be the same as that at Ahwaz where our represen- Vide Foreign Department telegram No. S*6£8, tatlVO Without any change of functions llUS dated 25th Decemoer 1908. recently been given local rank of Consul in order to give him precedence over Mr. Gratama, the newly created Dutch repre sentative. I may mention that the course in question is followed by the German Gov ernment here, their post being only a Vice-Consulate but their representative, Dr. Listemann, having been endowed with the local rank of Consul. Should Russia withdraw, or reduce the status of, the post at Bunder Abbas then there would be little objection to our representative being a Vice-Con sul only. 9 . I am forwarding a copy of this communication to His Majesty’s Minister, but address it primarily to the Government of India as most of the previous correspondence on this subject has been conducted with the boreign Depart ment. G. C. B P., Simla.-No. C .46 F. D.-i 4 - 6 -o 9 .-- 44 .— ^.A.D’S.No. 1259 , dated Bashire, the 29 th May (received 7 th June) 1909 . From-MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf India in In my immediately preceding letter of to-day’s date I had the honour to address you on the subject of the status and sphere of jurisdiction attaching to our Consular post at Bunder Abbas. I avail myself of the opportunity to submit some simultaneous observations in regard to the ex-offi'.io association of the incumbent of that appointment with certain portions of the Oman Coast, and islands belonging to the Trucial Chiefs. 2 . Recommendations in this direction were made by Colonel Kemball in his letter No. 218 , dated 6 th November 1903 , and were approved by His Majesty’s Government. In making them I think my predecessor was prompted by two considerations ; firstly, to enable us to emphasize the fact or make good the view, if necessary, that the Mussendom Promontory and inlets and the tract of Oman Coast between Khor Kalbeh and Dibba were not subject to Muscat ; and secondly, with a view to keeping a vigilant eye on the Islands of Abu Musa Tanb, Sirri, etc., under Shargah. As far as the first consideration is concerned the position has been some what modified by the view subsequently adopted by us in regard to the northern limits of the Sultan’s jurisdiction, in the proceedings before the Hague Tribunal in the French Flag Case. 3 . Apart from this it has always been my view that it is not expedient for our representative at Bunder Abbas to be entrusted with any ex-officio relations with the Chiefs of the opposite coast or their possessions: and in the event of the need for his employment arising it should be under specific instructions from the Resident. My reason for holding this opinion is that the Trucial Sheikhs are trouble some individuals to deal with and require very careful handling, preferably by officers whom they know, whereas as a rule it is not possible to keep officers long at Bunder Abbas, for climatic reasons, and our representative there is generally a young probationer or very junior political officer without the requisite experience or language qualification for the purpose required. This view of the question has indeed been interpreted in the practice of the last 5 years and the issue of special orders on the subject by Government appears to be hardly called for. At the same time it seems advisable, now that the jurisdiction of our representative at Bunder Abbas is under consideration, that the Government of India should be cognizant of my views. 4 . It will be understood in this connection that as long as our Consul or Vice-Cousul at Bunder Abbas, and our representative at Lingah, if his appoint ment is carried out, are gazetted, as I hope they will be, “ Assistant to the Resident in the Persian Gulf ” the latter is in a position to depute them when ever need arises in any portion of his sphere, and that power covers all require ments without giving the possessors any ex-officio functions in the direction under reference. As a matter of fact if an Indian Officer is appointed to Lingah, it is probable that he will be employed a good deal on the Trucial Coast as the commerce of Lingah is inseparable from that of Debai ; and it is hoped that the latter will repay attention and development on its own account.

My Lord, With reference to Your Lordship’s telegram dated the 3rd Eeb- l-2 c 7‘ ruary 1909, we have the honour to sub mit a copy of the correspondence noted in the margin, relative to the estimated cost of establishing a Vice-Consulate at Lingah. Your Lordship will observe that the Political Resident in the Persian Letter from the First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 446, dated the 14th February 1909, with enclosures. Telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 113, dated the 3rd March 1909. 2 . Gulf has proposed alternative estimates. The first is based on the assumption that the appointment will be an addition to the regular cadre of our Political Department, while the second, which is framed on more economical lines, contemplates the employment as Vice-Consul of a young military candidate for the Department. In both cases it has been assumed that the appointment will, for the present, be temporary. 3. A comparative statement exhibiting the cost of the alternative proposals is enclosed. The cost of an escort is not included in this statement, as, in our opinion, the Vice-Consul will not, for the present at any rate, require an escort. The first estimate, which was prepared by the First Assistant to the Political Resident, and was subsequently approved by Major Cox, involves ^an initial expenditure of Rs. 3,700 and a recurring expenditure of Rs. 19,4 85 a year, while the second estimate, which was prepared by Major Cox mmseli, involves an initial expenditure of Rs. 2,250 and a recurring expenditure ot Rs. 11,250 a year. 4.

Major Cox considers that the British officer who is appointed to Lingah can suitably be also in charge of our interests at Debai. He suggests the transfer of the head-quarters of our Native Agent from Shargah to Hebai and the con nection of that port with Henjam by a wireless installation.

In accoidance with the telegraphic instructions received under Foreign Department, Ko. 50*8., dated the 10th February 1909, I have the honour to submit proposals for the Establishment of the Vice-Consul at Lingah While observing rigid economy in the proposed estimate I have taken care to leave out nothing needful. 2. The proposals are embodied in— (I) the usual Proposition Statement showing the Establishment required. (II) Statement (A) dealing with annual recurring expenditure. (III) Statement (B) dealing with initial expenditure. 3. With reference to the Proposition Statement, the establishment has been confined to what is absolutely necessary. The pay of the English clerk and of the Munshi has been fixed lower than that of similar incumbents in other offices subordinate to this Eesidency, while the pay of the Menial Establishment has been regulated according to the rate sanctioned for similar establishment of the Bunder Abbas Consulate. No provision has been made for a Cavalry Escort as it does not appear to be essential; hut if the Vice-Consul is expected to maintain his position in a manner befitting the representative of the Government of India at Lingah, it is desirable to allows him an escort which may consist of one Duifadar and three sowars, the cost of which will he Bs. 1,7G4 per annum as follows :— Rs. One Duffadar at Rs. 45 per mensem ..... 540 Three Sowars at Rs. 34 each per mensem .... 1,224 Total . 1,764 The total cost of the permanent establishment will then be Bs. 17,817. 4. Beferring to statement (A), I find that the only items regarding which some explanation may be desirable are :— («) Travelling allowance. (6) Hire of Transport. (c) Bent of the Vice-Consulate. Provision under the first two heads aggregating Ks. 1,000 has b ee:n m a de on the assumption that the Vice-Consul will be expected to tour by Inn to Shibkoo ports and occasionally to Lar and Ghilladar in connection with the work which may arise in those places. With regard to (c) provision for the rent of the Vice-Consulate : there are no suitable houses at Lingah for the accommodation of t e ice-_onsu am his establishment permanently, and the question of _building sui ai c quaivus will have to be decided at no distant date. Meanwhile some temporary arrangements will have to be made for opening the ice ' ^° 71 su a e . * therefore, be necessary that the new Vice-Crnsul shou c ren a ° use 1 the amount provided in the estimate will, in my opinion, su ce.

But having regard to fact that project is tentative these conditions though preferable are not essential, and if expense involved thereby is considered prohibitive, I suggest following alternative as being possible and more economical. Firstly, incumbent to be military candidate for Political Department on a salary equivalent to four hundred pounds sterling per annum, with house allowance of fifty pounds sterling per annum. Secondly, in lieu of expenditure estimated in Statement B an equipment grant of one hundred and fifty pounds sterling. Thirdly, for expenses of establishment as per Proposition Statement or a modification is a contract grant of two hundred pounds sterling per annum to he expended under the supervision of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Fourthly, for recurring expenditure estimated on Statement A, contract grant of one hundred pounds sterling per annum on same conditions. Total one hundred and fifiy pounds sterling initial and seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling per annum recurring. The above proposals have been made on the supposition that until it is decided whether appointment will be permanent, the incumbent will be able to indent on the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf when necessary for such needs as camp equipage, presents, etc. ^Enclosure No. 3.

Although conditions are difficult and in many respects unsatisfactory, I have come to ultimate conclusion that time is not yet ripe for permanent residence of British Political Officer on the coast. The Sheikhs require very cautious handling, and there is some fear that permanent presence of British officer might have effect of provoking issues in connection with status of Sheikhs and pearling industry, which are quiescent at present, and which it would not be to our interest to raise now. Mv opinion is that if we appoint British officer to Lingah he will have ample time to make frequent sojourns at Debaj to study trade ramihcations there which are closely allied to those of Lingah. ^ It in addition to this sanction is accorded to the connection of Debai^ with Heniam by wireless telegraphy, and if lastly a convenient opportunity is ta^en of transferring lorn Shargah to Debai head-quarters of our Native Agent, our interests on the coast should for the present be adequately safeguarded.1909.

I am further to state that there is at present no officer of the Levant Service who is available for the appointment in question, and that Sir E.

Viscount Morley is aware that in the arrangement as to the distribution of Persian Consular appointments between the British and Indian services arrived at in the correspondence ending with your letter of the 1st July 1903 1 the principle was generally followed of allotting posts on the Gulf Littoral to Indian officers* But he cannot hold that the arrangement then arrived at constituted a nxle admitting of no exception, and there seems to him no reason in the case of Lingah why the precedent of the appointment of an officer of the Levant ^ Service to the Vice-Consulate at Bushire should not be followed. The grounds on which the Resident in the Gulf recommended the creation of a Vice- Consulate at Lingah^do not indicate that an officer of Indian experience is needed for the post, and the appointment of an officer VV See f.O. letter of 37 Jan. 1903,para .4. 4 Not of 6 June 1903, para. 10.officer of the British Service would conduce to that economy in Persian exp enditure!which the S. of S * m Council, no less than the Lords Commrs . of the Treasury, attaches the greatest importance * Lord Morley would therefore ask Sir E.Grey to consider whether it would not he practicable to appoint an officer of the Levant Service to the proposed Vice-Consulate at Lmgah.

Foreign Office, Sir, 26th August 1908. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a Despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, forwarding copy of a report addressed to the Government of India by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, reviewing the general political situation in the Persian Gulf. I am to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive any obser vations which Viscount Morley may have to offer on this report in general, and in particular with regard to the following questions treated therein:— 10. The appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Lingah. It will be observed that this measure is strongly recommended by Mr. Marling, and Sir E. Grey is anxious to learn the view taken of the proposal by Lord Morley. 11. Major Cox inquires whether His Majesty’s Government have finally decided not to embark on any scheme for the policing of the Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas-Kerman trade routes, unless compelled to do so in order to save the lives of British subjects. 14. Major Cox submits that, in view of the present political situation in Persia, the existing arrangement whereby three of His Majesty s ships are subsidised for service m the Persian Gulf, is no longer adequate as a support to himself in the defence of British interests in that region. Should Lord Morley concur in this view, it would become necessary to approach the proper Departments with a view to the rewsion of the arrangement at present in force. I am to add, with reference to Section 1 of Major Cox s report^ that the question of instructing Mr. Barclay, His Majesty’s newly-appointed Minister at Tehran, to proceed to his post by way ot the 1 ersian trult, has been considered, but that the difficulty and inconvenience attendant upon such a journey, as well as the delay which it would necessarily entail, appear to outweigh any advantage to be gained from undertaking it and that Mr. Barclay will, therefore, follow the ordinary route. Mr Barclay might be able to visit the Gulf later on or it might be advisable to adopt the alternative plan for which Mr. Marling appears to express a preference, and to instruct Major Cox to visit iehran at the earliest opportunity after Mr. Barclay s arrival there. , ‘ With regard to Section 9, I am to state that a copy of Mr. Marling s despatch will be forwarded to His Majesty s Ambassador at bt. 1 eters- urg With instructions to use his discretion in taking an opportunity if e should think it advisable, of approaching the Russian Government with regard to the withdrawal of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas, after certain changes which are to be introduced into the personnel of the Russian establishments in Persia have taken place. The Under Secretary of State ! j()l Ib MalLET ‘ for India.Annex 1. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey. No. 167. (Confidential.) Gnlahek, gj r 14tli July 1908. I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch addressed by Major Cox to the Government of India giving a most interesting review of the general political situation in the Persian Gulf. Major Cox’ despatch so exactly represents my own opinions on such questions as lie within my purview that 1 need do no more than offer a few observations on one or two special points. I am more particularly in agreement in his advocacy of a personal discussion of Gulf questions between His Majesty’s Representative in Tehran and the Resident in the Gulf. So far as I can see, however, there is but little prospect that the state of affairs in the capital will enable the former to leave his post for some time to come, and the only alternative would seem to be that the Resident in the Gulf should come to Tehran. I am not, indeed, prepared to say that the latter is not the preferable alternative ; the Legation is, indeed, kept so well informed of Gulf questions, both individual and general, by Major Cox’s admirable and exhaustive despatches that 1 doubt whether the short visit which a Minister could pay to Bushire would add very much to his effective knowledge. The Resident, on the other hand, is in the nature of things less well supplied with information on the political conditions at Tehran, or at all events obtains such information only after considerable delay, and 1 am disposed to believe that a visit of the Resident to Tehran would on the whole produce better results than would a hasty tour in the Gulf by the Minister. I express this opinion with the greater confidence after reading Major Cox’s present despatch, in which there is scarcely a single sentence on purely Persian questions, and but few on Gulf matters outside the jurisdiction of the Legation, which might not well have been written from Tehran instead of Bushire. As regards the inimical attitude towards us of some of the Russian Consular officers in the Gulf, on which Major Cox lays some stress, I must confess that I have not found it easy, in the absence of delinite charges, to approach the Russian Minister on the question. I have, however, on one or two occasions towards the end of last year mentioned to him that the Residency Agent at Lingah frequently found that Sadeed-es- Sultaneh was using his influence as Russian Consular officer to our detriment. M. de Hartwig promised to send, and I make no question did send, instructions to the Sadeed to cease from activity of the kind complained of, but, speaking from memory, I gather from his language that he had not much hope that his injunctions would produce much effect, as Sadeed-es-Sultaneh was rather inclined to be independent. I have never mentioned M. Ovseenko’s attitude to M. de Hartwig, as from the occasional references he has made to that gentleman I have been led to gather that he has a very high opinion of his capacity and services, and that in default of some definite charge I have felt that no good would result from doing so. I am also very much impressed with the desirability of appointing a British Consular officer in place of the Residency Agent at Lingah. 1 have more than once been at a loss to explain to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs what the precise status of the latter official is. He would not appear to possess rightly any Consular functions, for no exequatur has been granted to him by the Persian Government. But this is a matter of secondary importance, the real point is that, in view of the efforts which Germany is making to establish a stray interest at Lingah, it is of considerable moment that Great Britain should be so represented there that her interests should be adequately protected and advanced.

Marling, Esq., &amp;c., &amp;c. (Confidential.) Annex 3. Major Cox to Government of India. Sir, 6th June 1908. Bnshire, I have the honour to state that when Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, His Majesty s late Minister at Tehran, left his post on short leave in the autumn, I wrote to urge him to return, if possible, via the Persian Gulf. Subsequently, on learning that he would not resume his appointment in Persia, I ventured to express to His Majesty’s Secretar} 7 of State for Foreign Affairs the hope that it might be found practicable for Sir Cecil Spring-Rice’s successor to join his post by this route. It would, I feel confident, have been greatly in the public interest and to the advantage of the work between His Majesty’s Legation and this Residency had the new T Minister been able in my company to examine on the spot various aspects of the political and commercial outlook in the south, recently modified as it has been by the conclusion of the Anglo- Russian Convention, the activity of Germany and the effect of the national movement in Persia upon the economic condition of the country. In the hope that this meeting might take shape, I deferred addressing any special representations to the Government of India on the existing situation, but the travelling season has now passed, and I can no longer look forward to the privilege of discussing it in person with His Majesty’s Representative in the first instance. I am therefore constrained to lay the following independent observations before the Government of India :— 2. During the past eighteen months the situation has been very considerably affected, as far as our interests in the sphere of my appointment are concerned, by the three forces or events above quoted. I will touch upon their several effects in turn. 3. Our Reconciliation with ftnssm.—M. Passak, during the four years in which he represented Russian interests in lars and the Gulf, appealed to me to work against us in every direction in which useful openings could be gained for so doing, and he apparently evinced the same disposition when transferred tb the Russian Legation at Tehran. Of M Andre Miller, who succeeded him, I have never had any cause for complaint. During the progress of the negotiations leading up to the Convention his attitude was correct and cordial, and since its conclusion our relations have increased in frankness, and I have every reason to hope and believe that the Russian Consulate-General at Bushire has which M Ovseenko still fills. Deprived by the conclusion of the Con vention and probably by specific instructions from his Legation of any legitimate excuse for direct or overt opposition, he seems unable to divest s. i. Bhimself of habits and bias of long-standing, and continues to be a con siderable source of inconvenience to our Consulate and interests through the instrumentality of several Persian agents whom he employs on missions of espionage and intrigue. I may mention two who are chielly prominent; firstly, the Sadood-es-Sultaneh, a drunken but clever, little Persian with whom, when Foreign Office Agent at Bushire a few years ago, the Residency refused to hold communication owing to his undesir able character and his obstructive attitude towards British interests; secondly, one Abdul Kassim, at one time a Munchi m the lontish Residency, but discharged as an undesirable character. Whenevei any strings exist which can be pulled to our prejudice, those persons am others like them are there to pull them, either by newspapei aitides 01 by the encouragement of local Medjliss and Persian patiiots in pro moting the new doctrine of “ Persia for the Persians and away with foreign influence.” Foreign influence, so far as they and the Gulf arc, concerned, is a synonym for British influence, and it is to the efforts of such persons and others of their kidney that the frequent difficulties which we now experience in effecting the protection of Bahreinis and subjects of the Trucial Coast are primarily due. 4. It is of interest to note here that whereas I have always prohibited the Persian employes of the Residency from joining the numerous mushroom Societies which the national movement has generated, and from identifying themselves with party politics, the representatives of other Powers appear to place no such restrictions on their men, who, in the case of Bunder Abbas, seem to be actively encouraged thereto by M. Ovseenko. But it is difficult to formulate definite charges in such matters, which could be fully substantiated if necessity arose, and I can only hope that the evil is a temporary one which, in view of our altered relations widi Russia, will disappear with M. Ovseenko’s departure on leave or elsewhere, or perhaps with the relinquishment altogether of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas for which there is now no serious justification. With the above exception, Russian competition in the Gulf, whether commercial or political, may, I think, be regarded for the present as giving us little or no cause for anxiety. 5. The attitude of Germany .—Until comparatively lately the German Consulate at Bushire may be said to have been merely a post of obser vation, but since the inception of the Hamburg-Amerika steamer service to the Gulf and the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Convention, it can no longer be regarded in that light. In May 1907 Dr. Listemann, the incumbent of the German Consulate, v r as translated to his Legation for the summer, and since his return, after six months under the influence of Herr von Richthofen, his bearing has altogether altered. Whereas formerly he used to mix freely with the rest of the Bushire community socially, he is nowadays seldom seen anywhere, and keeps much to himself. Officially, though outwardly friendly, he shows himself in many little ways more prone to worry than before, and at present the question of Gulf quarantine seems to be the direction in which, apart from the Abu Musa case, his energies are chiefly directed. But though it will no doubt assume more of a political aspect as time goes on, the present Anglo-German question in the Gulf and Southern Persia is essentially commercial, and it is to that aspect of it that we now need chiefly to direct our energies. In this connection, I may mention that Messrs. Wonckhaus’ agency at Lingah is being worked with great activity under Mr. Brown, who has sometimes two, at other times three, German assistants with him, and they appear to be using Lingah where, owing to the absence of serious competition from our own nationals, they can practically do as they like, as a training-ground for their newly-arrived assistants and as the head-quarters of their Gulf operations, as distinct from their Bussorah-Bagdad branch. Moreover,Mr Brown, except for his own assistants, being the only European now m Lmgah, is identifying himself closely with local politics, and endeavouring to constitute himself a power in the place in a way which is likely to prove of considerable inconvenience to us. b. The effect of the recent national and constitutional movement upon the administrative and economic conditions in Fars and on the Persian (julf Littoral. Much might be written regarding the general results of the past eighteen months’ working of the movement; but Government must be generally iamiliar with its life history from the diaries and reports of .their officers in Southern Persia, and I will therefore curtail my remarks as far as practicable. The national development is obviously one which any British Govern ment would be, primd facie, disposed, on principle, to watch with sympathetic interest, and I think it may be presumed that it has been watched by their local representatives in that spirit, in its earlier stages at all events. But even in the north, where the standard of civilisation is much more advanced and. the people are more ripe for regeneration, His Majesty’s Legation must, I think, be beginning to despair at the continued prevalence of administrative chaos and the absence of all effective government. In'the south I confess I have seen no result from the national movement and the attempt at constitutional government which has been otherwise than subversive of law and order, and generally paralyzing both to the administration and to commerce. Thus the authority of local Governors has been altogether undermined by it. Provided as they now are with altogether inadequate pav, they are obliged to resort to all sorts of devices to obtain funds, and there has consequently been no cessation of corrupt methods of government, the only apparent difference being that the local official now lacks the practical personal authority to govern which he possessed before. Under the old regime, so long as he paid the revenue assessment regularly and complaints from his province were not too overwhelming, no questions were asked, and he was left to drive his own coach. Under the new conditions, including the existence of a free press and the right of public meeting, whenever a local Governor attempts to assert his authority in an effective and deterrent manner, some individual with a private grudge or an axe to grind, or one of the numerous bocieties which have sprung up forthwith, dispatches a telegram to the Parliament or inspires a scurrilous article in the vernacular press, and a day 01 two later the Governor receives a telegram from Tehran asking for informa tion and report. Our present Persian Representative at Bushire, the Derya Begi, who on the whole has proved the most effective and conciliatory Governor we have had, has repeatedly of late expiessed his exasperation at the humiliating position to which he has been ieduced, and at the impossibility of exercising effective authority under existing The result is that the province of Fars and Persian Baluchistan (and Kermanshah for that matter) are in a state of lawlessness and adminis trative chaos which has not been equalled for generations, and under present conditions it is difficult to conceive How things can be righted or prevented from going from bad to worse except by foreign intervention in some form. Our commercial interests^ are most immediately affected in the matter of communications. Brigandage has been rife on the chief trade routes, i.e., Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas-Kerman for two years past. The forwarding of goods has been repeatedly stoppe altogether and trade with the interior brought to a standstill. Irade has &amp; in fact, been paralyzed, and cases of bankruptcy among the native merchants in trading relations with British firms have been of almost ihady occurrence.the route some pule hope has, indeed, been inspired by the appointment of the Zil-es-Sultan, but conditions on the Kerman route are still as bad as they can be.7. There is one other direction in which the changed conditions of government in Tehran have affected our interests adversely, namely, in their bearing upon the administration of the customs. When the Tariff of 1903 and the Belgian Administration were first inaugurated the Government of India will remember that for a long time afterwards a good deal of difficulty was experienced by political officers owing to the aggressive attitude of some of the inexperienced Belgians with whom they had to deal. As time progressed, however, a working modus vivendi was gradually arrived at, by concessions made on both sides, and, within the sphere of my post at all events, relations with the Belgian regime had much improved at the epoch at which the intro duction of Parliamentary government took place. From the first, however, the attitude of the popular party was most hostile to M. Fans and his Belgian staff, and the position of the latter has since been a difficult and precarious one in consequence. On the one hand, while under M. Nans’ regime the local Directors were allowed to engage Bagdadis, Chaldeans, and Armenians as clerks or subordinates, and found that they were better served by these than by Persians, they are now under orders to entertain Persians wherever possible. Persians are being employed also in the higher grades, such as the Directorship of Lingah. The type of Persian which the Depart ment gets, especially those sent from the north, is of the partially or sometimes highly educated newspaper-reading class, which has been most influenced by the nationalist propaganda preached therein and most intrinsically hostile to the presence of foreigners in any Department of the Persian Government. These men naturally work against their Belgian superiors, and the position of the latter has become so unpalatable that resignations and departures on leave pending retirement have been rife during the past year, and include the men who have been most conciliatory in their relations with us. The truth is that under the old regime if they wanted a reasonably quiet time they had to curry favour with the Russians or ourselves; now they have to conciliate the Medjliss and vernacular papers, which lose no opportunity of making things uncomfortable for them. On the other hand, owing to the great financial straits to which the Central Government is reduced, the Customs Directors are constantly being pressed to submit more copious funds to the capital, and in order to increase their receipts and meet such demands, they have had recourse to the strict application of many items of the Reglement which they have before allowed to become a dead letter or had interpreted liberally after learning by experience that they were unsuited to the peculiar conditions of commerce in the harbourless Gulf ports. We now seem to be gradually drifting back to the unpleasant relations of three years ago, and at present the British trader has not only to contend with every conceivable difficulty and risk which the insecurity of the trade routes and the uncontrolled licence of tufangchis can provide, but is being daily harassed at the ports by some harsh decision or the new or revived interpretation of some catchpenny clause in the Reglement. 8. Having in the foregoing paragraphs placed before Government in the light which it presents itself to me the general situation existing within the sphere of my post, I now have the honour with much respect to suggest means which, short of armed intervention for the protection of our interests, seem likely in my judgment to strengthen our hands. I will record them in the same order as the subjects above indicated with which they are connected. 9. The possible withdrawal of the Russian Consulate, Bunder Abbas .— If I remember right His Majesty’s Legation, before the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement, did draw the attention of the Russian Legation to M. Ovseenko’s demeanour towards our Consulate and interests, and Sir Cecil Spring-Rice expressed to me incidentally theop.mon or the hope that the Czar’s Government could hardly retain him he after t the T conclusl011 ° f negotiations. Nevertheless, to formnWo hlS T post , 1 am aw . are - however, that it would be difficult to tormulate specific charges against him which could, if necessary be b fi dll ' ect . P 1 : 00 ^ hut perhaps His Majesty’s Government won d consider the feasibility of sounding the Russian Ambassador as to whether his Government intend to maintain their present arrangements at Jiunder Abbas, where their interests are now exiguous. 10. Appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Ling ah. —Owing in a great measure to the supineness and excessive caution of our own merchants it will be seen that Messrs. Wonckhaus, through their energetic employe, Mr. Jirown, have acquired a very firm footing in Lingah. Moreover! they aie already, I believe, doing a good deal of business with the I racial Coast, through their friend, Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh; the latter being agent for the Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Company, whose steamers ply there with more or less regularity. I have done my best to induce Messrs. Gray Paul to improve their representation at Lingah, where they have hitherto entrusted their interests to a useless native agent, and they now assure me that they will endeavour to make some better arrangement. I do not, however, expect much from them, and in my view it is important that Government should appoint a British officer as A ice-Consul at that port who would lay himself out both to work up the trade of the port and at the same time to counteract the personal influence of Messrs. Wonckhaus 1 representative who now has the field to himself. Our present Residency Agent, Khan Saheb Agha Bedr, who is an excellent specimen of his class and the best native agent we have had, looks after British subjects and protected persons with much zeal and energy, but he cannot be of much service in regard to trade questions. He only receives a salary of 50 rupees per mensem, and I recommend that he be maintained where he is as native assistant to the Consular officer, who could employ him most usefully to work up influence in the Lar and Bastak districts, which are supplied from Lingah, and to which the Germans will certainly turn their attention if they have not already. The appointment of a British officer might be considered tentative for two or three years. Regarding the mother o’ pearl trade from Lingah, which has proved the making of the German firm, I am addressing Government separately. 11. The Policing of the Trade Routes. —Has it been finally decided by His Majesty’s Government that, except the step be forced on them, in order to save the lives of Englishmen in Persia, they will not embark on any scheme for the policing of the Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas- Kerman routes, either that advocated by Mr. Grahame or any modification of it ? 12. Revision of Customs Tariff and “Reglement' of 1903.—The fundamental condition on which this Tariff was accepted was that all other transit dues and imposts should be abolished, but it is now upwards of four years since the Tariff was introduced, and yet “ rahdari ” in one form or another, and other illegal imposts are persistently levied. It is not only a fact that the Central Government has no practical power to stop them, but they still include the income from various illegal taxes in the official schedule of revenue which they call upon local Governors to collect. tt ■ n t * &gt; The continual representations of this Residency and His Majesty s Legation have no result, a levy is merely taken off to-day and imposed to-morrow. . , , Then, again, the heavy duty imposed on certain classes ol goods, such as tea, coffee, has created a colossal system of organized smuggling throughout’ the Persian littoral, with which the Persian Government areentirely unable to cope, and which nothing but a reveision to a reason able all-round ad valovem tariff or an organized system of coastguaid will stop. This smuggling industry is obviously extremely damaging to the interests of legitimate trade. An honest trader at the ports naturally cannot do business when the wares tn which he deals can be bought for 10 or 15 per cent, less a few miles outside the port if not actually in it. I respectfully ask if it is necessary that we continue indefinitely to allow our traders to be increasingly oppressed at the ports by the harsh application of an inflated tariff only accepted on specific terms, which the Persian Government make no attempt to fulfil, and could not if they would. Now that wo have settled our differences with Russia, would it not be possible to get them to agree to its abrogation in favour of an all round 71 or 8 per cent, ad valorem duty, a change which would render smuggling a useless risk and increase the revenue at the same time ? 13. An examination of the Arrangement under which His Majesty's ships “Sphinx,' “Lapwing,' and “Redbreast' are subsidised for Service in the Persian Gulf .—We have now had nearly four years’ experience of the working of this arrangement, and while cordially appreciating the complete co-operation and support which 1 have received from His Excellency Sir George Warrender and his predecessor Sir Edmund Poe, I realise that the Naval Commander-in-Chief cannot perform impossi bilities, and am of opinion that if present conditions are to continue, as it seems likely that they will, the requirements of the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf proper, and the Shatt-el-Arab cannot be adequately met by three vessels now subsidised. Even at normal times, taking into account their minimum periods of absence for necessary service purposes, such as recommissioning, redocking and fitting and occasional and very necessary changes of air and scene for the officers and crews, it is clearly very hard for three ships to do the work required of them without undue strain; and if the concentration of ships on the Mekran coast in the winter months in connection with the arms traffic is to continue, the needs of the northern part of the Gulf will suffer greatly. At the present time, moreover, owing to tlm absence of any settled or effective Government in Tehran His Majesty s Legation is perforce not in a position in connection with incidents arising in the Gulf to obtain satisfaction in Tehran by ordinary diplomatic means, and as His Majesty’s Government, for reasons which I well understand, have decided to refrain for the present from taking any drastic steps for asserting our position, it follows that, as in the recent case of the ill-treatment of a Pahreini at Lingah, I shall have to depend chiefly for maintaining our interests and good name in these wateis upon what can be effected locally with the means ordinarily available. It is very necessary therefore that I should not be deprived of the fortifying presence of one of His Majesty’s ships, within easy reach during the cold weather. 14. The extension of Cable Communication in the Persian Gulf — The proposal to connect Ivoweit and Bahrein with Bushire by cable or wireless installation is, I venture to hope, receiving favourable considera tion. It would be a great advantage to connect up Lingah at the same time, or at all events British Bassidu with Henjam, Bassidu being within easy reach of Lingah It would seem important also that His Majesty’s subsidized ships should be fitted with wireless as soon as possible.' 15. Improved Representation on the Trucial Coast—Yhe experience of the last two or three years makes me doubt whether it is safe to leave these backward Sheikhs longer m the charge of a native agent.

Your Excellency will observe that in Section 9 of this report Major Cox suggests that His Majesty’s Government should consider the ad visability of approaching the Russian Government with a view to obtain the abolition of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas. His Majesty’s Government understand that the Russian Government intend shortly to transfer the present Russian Minister at Tehran to another post, and, if you should think it advisable, an opportunity might be taken after M. D. Hartwig has left Persia of calling the attention of M. Isvolsky to the point raised by Major Cox. I leave the time and manner of taking this step entirely to your Excellency’s discretion. I am, Ac., E. Grey. Sir A. Nicolson, Ac., Ac.Enclosure No. 3. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey. No. 400. (Confidential.) St. Petersburg!!, ' 7th September 1908. I have had the honour to receive your Despatch No. 200, Con fidential, of the 26th ultimo, relative to the abolition of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas. I am of opinion that M. Isvolsky would not be indisposed to effect some considerable changes among the various Russian officials employed at Tehran and elsewhere in Persia, but he would expect that some corresponding measures would be taken by His Majesty’s Government in regard to British officials. It is no doubt true that we have perfectly sound reasons for desiring the transfer of certain Russian officials, whose activity at their present posts is inconvenient and unfortunate ; but the Russian Government imagine that to insure the smooth working of the Convention it would be most desirable that some British officials should also be moved to other spheres. The question is one which will have to be discussed sooner or later, and I should, of course, be perfectly ready to speak with M. Isvolsky on the subject, but I am sure that it would be to no purpose to select one individual Russian employe for special and solitary treatment. Moreover, I doubt whether it would be wise to ask for the abolition of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas. Such a request might lead to proposals from the other side that we should abolish a post or two in the Russian sphere ; and with this we might be disinclined to agree. I would suggest limiting our proposals to a change of individuals. As M. Isvolsky is visiting London next month, the question as to a reorganisation of the respective staffs might perhaps be opened up with him on that occasion, and the detailed discussions continued here when he returns. I would wish to take this opportunity of mentioning that I doubt if M. de Hartwig will be transferred as soon as was anticipated. It is considered but just that another post should be found for him, and at present there is no suitable one vacant. I have, &amp;c., A. Nicolson. The Right Hon. Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.P., Ac., Ac.

Letter from Board of Trade, dated 25th September 1908, regarding British commercial interests in the Persian Gulf.x\nnex 1. Board of Trade to Foreign Office. Sir, T 1 1 September 1908. 1 am directed by tbe Board of Trade to nelmnwlorl panymg report to the Uovermnent of India by the British Resident in the Persian Gulf dealing with various matters affecting British com- mercial interests in that region. ith icfeience thereto, I am to say that the Board are disposed to concur in Major Cox’s suggestion as to the desirability of establishing a ice-Consulate at Lmgah, especially in view of German commercial aeti\ ity in that vicinity. It will be seen from the accompanying table that as a consequence of the transference of a large portion of the pearl and shell trade to the neighbourhood of Bahrein the trade of the port has considerably declined during the last 10 years, and with it the Anglo-Indian share. It is still considerable, however, and the entrances and clearances of shipping (mostly British) tend to increase. The Board assume that any appointment which may be decided upon will be made in concert with the Indian Government. I am also to suggest, for the consideration of Sir E. Grey, whether a consular officer at Debai, to which much of the trade formerly done at Liugah has been transferred, and also whether the Political Resident at Bahrein, might be assisted by a paid vice-consul. With regard to Major Cox’s observations respecting the Persian Treaty Tariff I am to refer to the fact that this tariff is, in the main, that which was appended to the Russo-Persian Treaty, this having been the existing Anglo-Persian Treaty. In view, therefore, of the present understanding with Russia regarding Persia, the Board think that His Majesty’s Government would probably hesitate to make advances to Persia in the direction of embarking upon a new negotiation, however desirable it may be to secure some alteration of the tariff provisions, without first coming to an agreement with Russia upon the matter. The question whether circumstances are ripe for such action is one for the consideration of Sir E. Grey. adopted as the basis of the tariff side of the negotiations leading up to The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. I have, &amp;c., Arthur Wilson Fox. s. i. DAnnex 2. LING AH.

In reply to your letter No. 26,812, dated the 2Cth August last, and with reference to your letter of the 12th instant, No. 33,749’ enclosing copy of a letter from the Board of Trade, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to forward herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram from the Viceroy, dated 9th October 1908, conveying the views of theGovernment of India on the suggestions made by His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire m his letter of the Gth June 1908 regLdina the' general political situation in the Persian Gulf. ’ g th Govlrnrnent 1 “ or j e y. concurs generally in the vieivs expressed by the Gov ernment of India. As regards the various points raised in the correspondence, he desires to mate the following observations ( . L) °1 C° x t° Tehran Lord Morley considers that a wf . lie . t '' ee “ Slr p G -, Bilr , cla y anti Major Cox would be advantageous, and, subject to Sir E. Grey s approval, he is prepared to instruct the Government of India to authorise Major Cox, as soon as a suitable opportunity occurs for leaving the Gulf, to proceed to Tehran. (2.) British and Russian Consular Establishments.—The views of the Government of India on this subject are in substantial agreement with those expressed by His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh m his despatch of the / th September last, No. 400. Pending the consideration, in connection with the despatch promised by the Govern- mtnt of India, of the question of our own establishments, the most that can lie done^ is presumably to propose to the Russian Government a change of individuals, as suggested by Sir A. Nicolson, should a favourable occasion present itself. (3.) The immediate appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Lingah .—On a full consideration of the reasons given by Mr. Marling in his despatch of the 14th July last, No. 167, the Secretary of State in Council would be prepared, if Sir E. Grey agrees, that a case for immediate action has been made out, to accept a moiety of the cost of the appointment of a Vice-Consulate at Lingah as a charge upon Indian revenues, the other half being defrayed by the Imperial Exchequer. If a suitable officer of the Levant Consular Service were available for the post the cost would be less than if an officer of the Indian Political Department were appointed. It is observed that the Board of Trade are in favour of the creation of the appointment. (4.) Policing the trade routes .—The proposals formulated by the Government of India in their Despatch No. 33, dated the 15th March 1906, were communicated to the Foreign Office with my letter of the 1st May 1906. But the consideration of the subject was postponed owing to the decision of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury that an examination of the whole question of the scale of British expenditure in Persia was necessary before sanction could be given to the payment from British revenues of half the cost of any measures other than those that had actually been carried into effect. Sir E. Gorst’s letter of the 15th February 1907, in which the Secretary of State in Council was informed of this decision, stated that, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, while certain of the proposals that had been made might form the subject of further consideration, “ the question of policing the southern trade routes “ and of affording proper protection to British trade interests in that part “ of Persia is one of immediate importance.” Lord Morley concurs entirely m the view of the Government of India that, in the piesent condition of Persia, it is undesirable to take any action in the matter. (5.) Customs Administration.—On this point, also, Lord Morley aorees with the Government of India that no action should be taken pending developments of the financial position in Persia, when the matter &amp; will have to be considered in connection with the international question, referred to by the Board of Irade. (6.) Inadequacy of the present Naval Arrangements in the Gulf — Lord Morley is fully aware of the strain imposed upon His Majesty’s ships by the necessity for dealing with the arms traffic on the Mekran coast, ide agrees with the Government of India that the question mayIje postponed until the results of the Brussels Conference and of the negotiations respecting the importation of arms into Muskat, have been ascertained. (7.) Extension of Cable Communication and introduction of Wireless Telegraphy.—This subject will be dealt with in a separate communication. (8.) Trucial Coast.— Lord Morley will await the recommendations of the Government of India on the further report expected from Major Cox. In conclusion, I am to say that Lord Morley concurs entirely in the view indicated in the last sentence of the Viceroy’s telegram, that His Majesty’s Government, in dealing with questions of Persian policy, should bear in mind the effect likely to be produced by any action they may take, not only in Afghanistan, but in all countries subject to a Muhammadan government.

Please refer to your telegram of the 9th ultimo, asking for our views on the proposals in the letter of 6th June from Major Cox. We concur in the view expressed in letter of 14th July from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran that a visit to Tehran on the part of Major Cox might be advantageous. With regard to the question of the Consular representation of the Russian Government, a Despatch on our own Consular establishments in Persia is being sent to you, in which we have not found ourselves able to suggest that any reduction should be made. Suggestion that Bunder Abbas Consulate should be relinquished by Russia does not, therefore, seem to us desirable. It would, no doubt, be desirable that M. Ovseenko should be transferred, but it would, perhaps, be unwise to press this just now, in view of statement by Mr. Marling as to the high esteem in which the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas is held by M. Hartwig. We support proposal of Mr. Marling and Major Cox for Vice-Consulate at Lingah, in view of efforts of Germany, half the cost being borne by Indian revenues. In the first instance the appointment might be limited to three years. With regard to the question of policing the trade routes, a proposal for utilising sowars was made in our Despatch of the 15th March 1906. Views of His Majesty’s Government on this proposal have not yet reached us. We doubt if it is practicable, under the changed conditions, to take action without interfering with Persian independence and integrity. As to the question of a radical change in the Customs, His Majesty’s Government are better judges than we of what the attitude of the European Powers concerned would be. If an opening for interference and suggestion of international control could be given to Germany by the raising of this question, it would probably be preferable that things should be left alone pending the treatment, in connection with a loan or bankruptcy, of the whole financial position of Persia. If present conditions continue, we agree with Major Cox that three subsidised ships in the Gulf will be insufficient. But until the results of the Arms Conference are made known, this question might stand over. Our views on the question of extension of cable communication were stated in our telegram of 21st September.Further representations from Major Cox are still awaited with regard to arrangements on trucial coast. We desire to make it clear, in recording our opinions, that they are formed with reference to the present state of finances and politics of Peisia, and, in view of the fact that the bringing about of substantial reforms appears to be hopeless. As developments in Persia are being closely watched by the Afghans, it is also important that, for the present, no action should be taken by which the status quo would be materially altered in Persia. I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo, respecting the suggestions made by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire in his Despatch of 6th June 1908, regarding the general political situation in the Persian Gulf. 1. Visit of Major Cox to Tehran—Sir E. Grey concurs in the proposal that Major Cox should be authorised, as soon as a suitable opportunity occurs for leaving the Gulf, to proceed to Tehran. 2. British and Russian Consular Establishments—Sir E. Grey concurs in the view that consideration of this subject in general should be deferred as proposed ; he is, however, not disposed to take any action in regard to the transfer of M. Ovseenko for the present. 3. The immediate appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Lingah — Sir E. Grey concurs that an such appointment is desirable, and he is about to have the matter brought before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. 4. Policing the trade routes—Sir E. Grey concurs in the views of Lord Morley. Enclosure No. 6. Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, No. 39,454. Foreign Office, 1st December 1908. 5. Customs Administration. —Sir E.

In connection with what is said in your letter under the heading of “ British and Russian Consular Establishments,” Viscount Morley would invite the attention of Secretary Sir E.

We have not yet received views of His Majesty s (xovernment on this proposal. In changed conditions, we doubt practicability of taking action without interfering with integrity and independence of Persia. His Majesty’s Government are in a better position than we to judge of attitude of European powers to a radical change in the Customs. If the raising of this question would give Germany an opening for interference and suggestion of international control, it would probably be better to leave things alone until the whole financial position in Persia comes under treatment in connection with a loan or bankruptcy. We agree with Cox that if present conditions continue, three subsidised ships will not suffice for the Gulf. But this question might lie over until the results of the Arms Conference are known. As regards extension of cable communication, please see our telegram of the 21st ultimo. As regards trucial coast, we still await Cox’s further representation. In recording our opinions, we wish to make it clear that they are made with reference to present condition of Persian politics and finances, and apparent hopelessness of securing substantial reforms. It is also important, as the Afghans are watching developments in Persia closely, that no action should be taken at present which would materially alter status quo in Persia.jThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Governmp.nt ■ [B] PERSIA.

Gulahek, July 14, 1908. 1 xiAVrj the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch addressed bv Major Cox to the Government of India giving a most interesting review of the general political situation in the Persian Gulf. Major Cox’ despatch so exactly represents my own opinions on such questions as lie within my purview that I need do no more than offer a few observations on one or two special points. I am more particularly in agreement in his advocacy of a personal discussion of Gulf questions between His Majesty’s Representative in Tehran and the Resident in the Gulf. So far as I can see, however, there is but little prospect that the state of affairs in the capital will enable the former to leave his post for some time to come, and the only alternative would seem to be that the Resident in the Gulf should come to Tehran. I am not, indeed, prepared to say that the latter is net the preferable alternative; the Legation is, indeed, kept so well informed of Gulf questions, both individual and general, by Major Cox’ admirable and exhaustive despatches that I doubt whether the short visit which a Minister could pay to Bushire would add very much to his effective knowledge. The Resident, on the other hand, is in the nature of things less well supplied with information on the political conditions at Tehran, or at all events obtains such information only after considerable delay, and I am disposed to believe that a visit of the Resident to Tehran would on the whole produce better results than would a hasty tour in the Gulf by the Minister. I express this opinion with the greater confidence after reading Major Cox’ present despatch, in which there is scarcely a single sentence on purely Persian questions, and but few on Gulf matters outside the jurisdiction of the Legation, which might not well have been written from Tehran instead of Bushire. As regards the inimical attitude towards us of some of the Russian Consular officers in the Gulf, on which Major Cox lays some stress, I must confess that I have not found it easy, in the absence of definite charges, to approach the Russian Minister on the question* I have, however, on one or two occasions towards the end of last year mentioned to him that the Residency Agent at Lingah frequently found that Sadeed- es-Sultaneh was using his influence as Russian Consular officer to our detriment. M. de Hartwig promised to send, and I make no question did send, instructions to the Sadeed to cease from activity of the kind complained of, but, speaking from memory, I gathered from his language that he had not much hope that his injunctions would produce much effect, as Sadeed-es-Sultaneh was rather inclined to be independent. I have never mentioned M. Ovseenko’s attitude to M. de Hartwig, as from the occasional references he has made to that gentleman I nave been led to gather that he has a very high opinion of his capacity and sendees, and that in default of some definite charge I have felt that no good would result from doing so. I am also very much impressed with the desirability of appointing a British Consular officer in place of the Residency Agent at Lingah. 1 have more than once been at a loss to explain to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs what the precise status of the latter official is. He would not appear to possess rightly any Consular functions, for no exequatur has been granted to him by the Persian Government. But this is a matter of secondary importance, the real point is that m view of the efforts which Germany is making to establish a stray interest at Lingah, it is of considerable moment that Great Britain should be so represented there that her interests should be adequatelv protected and advanced. 4 ' 1 I have, &amp;c.

Bushire, June 6, 1908. I HAVE the honour to state that when Sir Cecil Spring-Eice, His Majesty’s late Minister at Tehran, left his post on short leave in the autumn, I wrote to urge him to return, if possible, via the Persian Gulf. Subsequently, on learning that he would not resume his appointment in Persia, I ventured to express to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the hope that it might be found practicable for Sir Cecil Spring-Rice’s successor to join his post by this route. It would, I feel confident, have been greatly in the public interest and to the advantage of the work between His Majesty’s Legation and this Residency had the new Minister been able in my company to examine on the spot various aspects of the political and commercial outlook in the south, recently modified as it has been by the conclusion oi the Anglo-Russian Convention, the activity of Germany and the effect of the national movement in Persia upon the economic condition of the country. In the hope that this meeting might take shape, I deferred addressing any special representa tions to the Government of India on the existing situation, but the travelling season has now passed, and I can no longer look forward to the privilege of discussing it in person with His Majesty’s Representative in the first instance. I am therefore constrained to lay the following independent observations before the Government of India:— 2. During the past eighteen months the situation has been very considerably affected, as far as our interests in the sphere of my appointment are concerned, by the three forces or events above quoted. I will touch upon their several effects in turn. 8. Our Reconciliation with Russia. —M. Passak, during the four years in which he represented Russian interests in Ears and the Gulf, appeared to me to Avork against us in every direction in which useful openings could be gained for so doing, and he apparently evinced the same disposition when transferred to the Russian Legation at Tehran. Of M. Andre Miller, who succeeded him, I have never had any cause for complaint. During the progress of the negotiations leading up to the Convention his attitude was correct and cordial, and since its conclusion our relations have increased in frankness, and I have every reason to hope and believe that the Russian Consulate- General at Bushire has ceased working to our prejudice. The same cannot yet be said of their (Consulate at Bunder Abbas, which M. Ovseenko still fills. Deprived by the conclusion of the Convention and probably by specific instructions from his Legation of any legitimate excuse for direct or overt opposition, he seems unable to divest himself of habits and bias of long-standing, and continues to be a considerable source of inconvenience to our Consulate and interests through the instrumentality of several Persian agents whom he employs on missions of espionage and intrigue. I may mention two who are chiefly prominent; firstly, the Sadood-es- Sultaneh, a drunken, but clever, little Persian with whom, when Foreign Office Agent at Bushire a few years ago, the Residency refused to hold communication owing to his undesirable character and his obstructive attitude toivards British interests; secondly, one Abdul Kassim, at one time a Mtmchi in the British Residency, but discharged as an undesirable character. Whenever any strings exist which can be pulled to ourprejudice, those persons and others like them are there to pull them, either by news paper articles or by the encouragement of local Medjliss and Persian “ patriots ” in promoting the new doctrine of “ Persia for the Persians and away with foreign influence.” Poreign influence, so far as they and the Gulf are concerned, is a synonym for British influence, and it is to the efforts of such persons and others of their kidney that the frequent difficulties which we now experience in effecting the protection of Bahreinis and subjects of the Trucial Coast are primarily due. 4. It is of interest to note here that whereas I have always prohibited the Persian employes of the Residency from joining the numerous mushroom Societies which the national movement has generated, and from identifying themselves with party politics, the representatives of other Powers appear to place no such restrictions on their men, who, in the case of Bunder Abbas, seem to be actively encouraged thereto by M. Ovseenko. But it is difficult to formulate definite charges in such matters, which could be fully substantiated if necessity arose, and I can only hope that the evil is a temporary one which, in view of our altered relations with Russia, will disappear with M. Ovseenko’s departure on leave or elsewhere, or perhaps with the relinquishment altogether of the Russian Consulate at Bunder Abbas for which there is now no serious justification. With the above exception, Russian competition in the Gulf, whether commercial or political, may, I think, be regarded for the present as giving us little or no cause tor anxiety. 5. The Attitude of Germany—Until comparatively lately the German Consulate at Bushire mav be said to have been merely a post of observation, but since the inception of the Hamburg—A merika steamer service to the Gulf and the conclusion ol the Anglo- Russian Convention, it can no longer be regarded in that light. In May 1907 Dr. Listemann, the incumbent of the German Consulate, was translated to his Legation for the summer, and since his return, after six months under the influence of Herr von Richthofen, his bearing has altogether altered. Whereas formerly he used to mix freely with the rest of the Bushire community socially, he is nowadays seldom seen anywhere, and keeps much to himself. Officially, though outwardly friendly he shows himself in many little ways more prone to worry than before, and at present the question of Gulf quarantine seems to be the direction in which, apart from the Abu Musa case, his energies are chiefly directed. But though it will no doubt assume ill ^ re of apolitical aspect as time goes on, the present Anglo-German question m the Gull and Southern Persia is essentially commercial, and it is to that aspect of it that we non need chiefly to direct our energies. In this connection, I may mention that Messrs. Wonckhaus’agency at Lingah is being worked with great activity under Mr. Brown, who has sometimes two, at other times three, German assistants with him, and the) appear to be using Lingah where, owing to the absence of serious competition from om ovvn nationals, they can practically do as they like, as a training-ground for heir newlj- arrived assistants and as the head-quarters of their Gull operations, as distinct fiom t e Bussorah-Bagdad branch. Moreover, Mr. Brown, except for his own assistants uemg the only European now in Lingah, is identifying himself closely with iocal politics and endeavouring to constitute himself a power in the place in a uay which is likely to pio of considerable inconvenience to us. . 7 • • 6.

[1893 d—2]corrupt methods of government, the only apparent difference being that the local official now lacks the practical personal authority to govern which he possessed before. Under the old regime, so long as he paid the revenue assessment regularly and ^ complaints from his province were not too overwhelming, no questions were asked, and he was left to drive his own coach. Under the new conditions, including the existence of a free press and the right of public meeting, whenever a local Governor attempts to assert his authority in an effective and deterrent manner, some individual with a privat grudo*e or an axe to grind, or one of the numerous Societies which have sprung up forthwith, dispatches a telegram to the Parliament or inspires a scurrilous article in the vernacular press, and a day or two later the Governor receives a telegram from Tehran asking for information and report. Our present Persian Representative at Bushire, the Derya Begi, who on the whole has proved the most effective and conciliatory Governor we have had, has repeatedly of late expressed his exasperation at the humiliating position to which he has been reduced, and at the impossibility of exercising effective authority under existing conditions. The result is that the province of Ears and Persian Baluchistan (and Kermanshah for that matter) are in a state of lawlessness and administrative chaos which has not been equalled for generations, and under present conditions it is difficult to conceive how things can be righted or prevented from going from going bad to worse except by fortign intervention in some form. Our commercial interests are most immediately affected in the matter of communications. Brigandage has been rife on the chief trade routes, ?.e., Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas-Kerman for two years past. The forwarding of goods has been repeatedly stopped altogether and trade with the interior brought to a standstill. Trade has, in fact, been paralyzed, and cases of bankruptcy among (he native merchants in trading relations with British firms have been of almost daily occurrence. As regards the Shiraz route some little hope has, indeed, been inspired by the appointment of the Zil-es-Sultan, but conditions on the Kerman route are still as bad as they can be. 7. There is one other direction in which the changed conditions of government in Tehran have affected our interests adversely, namely, in their bearing upon the adminis tration of the customs. When the Tariff of 1903 and the Belgian Administration were first inaugurated the Government of India will remember that for a long time afterwards a good deal of difficulty was experienced by political officers owing to the aggressive attitude of some of (he inexperienced Belgians with whom they had to deal. As time progressed, however, a working modus vivendi was gradually arrived at, by concessions made on both sides, and within the sphere of my post at all events, relations with the Belgian regime had much improved at the epoch at which the introduction of Parliamentary government took place. From the first, however, the attitude of the popular party was most hostile to M. Naus and his Belgian staff, and the position of the latter has since been a difficult and precarious one in consequence. On the one hand, while under M. Xaus’ regime the local Directors were allowed to engage Bagdadis, Chaldeans, and Armenians as clerks or subordinates, and found that they were better served by these than by Persians, they are now under orders to entertain Persians wherever possible. Persians are being employed also in the higher grades, such as the Directorship of Lingah. The type of Persian which the Department gets, especially those sent from the north, is of the partially or sometimes highly educated newspaper-reading class, which has been most influenced by the nationalist propaganda preached therein and most intrinsically hostile to the presence of foreigners in any Department of the Persian Government. These men naturally work against their Belgian superiors, and the position of the latter has become so unpalatable that resignations and departures on leave pending retirement have been rife during the past year, and include the men who have been most conciliatory in their relations with us. The truth is that under the old regime if they wanted a reasonably quiet time they had to curry favour with the Russians or ourselves; now they have to conciliate the Medjliss and vernacular papers, which lose no opportunity of making things uncomfort- for them. On the other hand, owing to the great financial straits to which the Central Government is reduced, the Customs Directors are constantly being pressed to submit more copious funds to the capital and in order to increase their receipts and meet such demands, they have had recourse to the strict application of many items of the Regleihent which they have before allowed to become a dead letter or had interpreted liberally after learning by experience that they were unsuited to the peculiar conditions5 &lt;&gt;t com me i ce in the harbourless G-ult ports. We now seem to be gradually drifting back to the unpleasant relations of three years ago, and at present the British trader has not only to contend with every conceivable difficulty and risk which the insecurity of the trade routes and the uncontrolled licence of tufangchis can provide, but is being daily harassed at the ports by some harsh decision or the new or revived interpretation of some catchpenny clause in the B&amp;glement. 8. Having in the foregoing paragraphs placed before Government in the light which it presents itself to me the general situation existing within the sphere of my post, T now have the honour with much respect to suggest means which, short of armed intervention tor the protection of our interests, seem likely in my judgment to strengthen our hands. I will record them in the same order as the subjects above indicated with which they are connected. 9. The possible withdrawal of the Russian Consulate, Bunder Abbas. —If I remember right His Majesty’s Legation, before the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement, did draw the attention of the Russian Legation to M. Ovseenko’s demeanour towards our Consulate and interests, and Sir Cecil Spring-Rice expressed to me incidentally the opinion or the hope that the Czar’s Government could hardly retain him at Bunder Abbas after the conclusion of the negotiations. Nevertheless, he still retains Ids post. I am aware, however, that it would be difficult to formulate specific charges against him which could, if necessary, be substantiated by direct proof, but perhaps His Majesty’s Government would consider the feasibility of sounding the Russian Ambassador as to whether his Government intend to maintain their present arrangements at Bunder Abbas, where their interests arc now exiguous. 10. Appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Lingah. —Owing in a great measure to the supineness and excessive caution of our own merchants it will be seen that Messrs. Wonckhaus, through their energetic employe, Mr. Brown, havm acquired a very firm footing in Lingah. Moreover, they are already, 1 believe, doing a good deal of business with the Trucial Coast, through their friend, Haji Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh ; the latter being agent for the Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Company, whose steamers ply there with more or less regularity. I have done my best to induce Messrs. Gray Paul to improve their representation at Lingah, where they have hitherto entrusted their interests to a useless native agent, and they now assure me that they will endeavour to make some better arrangement. I do not, howevei, expect much from them, and in my view it is important that Government should appoint a British officer as Vice-Consul at that port who would lay himself out both to work up the trade of the port and at the same time to counteract the personal influence of Messrs. Wonckhaus’ representative who now has the field to himself. Our piesent Residency Ao-ont Khan Saheb Agha Bedr, who is an excellent specimen of his class and the best native agent we have had, looks after British subjects and protected persons with much zeal and energv, but he cannot be of much service in regard to trade questions. He only receives a' salary of 50 rupees per mensem, and I recommend that he be main- tained where he is as native assistant to the Consular officer, who could employ him most usefully to work up influence in the Lar and Bastak districts, which are supplied from Lingah, and to which the Germans will certainly turn their attention if they have not already. The appointment of a British officer might be considered tentative for tVV0 Reglrdin^the mother o’ pearl trade from Lingah, which has proved the making of the German firm, I am addressing Government separately. tt- at • + &gt; 11. The Policing of the Trade Routes.-llas it been finally decided by His Majesty s Government that, except the step be forced on them, in order to save tne lives of Englishmen in Persia, they will not embark on any scheme for the policing of tie Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas-Kerman routes, either that advocated by Mr. Grahame or any modification of it ? . , y&gt;^ n j emen t ” 0 f 1903.—The fundamental condi- 12. ^ ac cepted was that all other transit dues and imposts should h^bTlished but iHs n^w upwards of four years since the Tariff was introduced, and yet - rahdari’’in one form or another, and other illegal imposts are persistently levied. It . 4 , pi t i 1p Central Government has no practical power to stop them, but they sLH mclmle ttln^nm ftm vtims illegal taxes In the official schedule of revenue and His Majesty’s Legation have no result, a levy is merely taken off to-day and unposed ‘o-mmovv. t Then, again the heavy ttougho* the Persian coffee, has created a colossal system ot oigamzea smuggu g s6 littoral, with which the Persian Government are entirely unable to cope, and which nothing but a reversion to a reasonable all-round ad valorem Tariff or an organized system of coastguard will stop. This smuggling industry is obviously extremely damaging to the interests of legitimate trade. An honest trader at the ports naturally cannot do business when the wares in which he deals can be bought tor 10 or lo per cent, less a few miles outside the port if not actually in it. I respectfully ask if it is necessary that we continue indefinitely to allow our traders to be increasingly oppressed at the ports by the harsh application of an inflated Tariff only accepted on specific terms, which the Persian Government make no attempt to fulfil and could not if they would. Now that we have settled our differences with Russia, would it not be possible to get them to agree to its abrogation in favour of an all-round or 8 per cent, ad, valorem duty, a change which would render smuggling a useless risk and increase the revenue at the same time ? 13. An Examination of the Arrangement under which His Majesty's ships “ Sphinx” “ Lapwing,” and “ Redbreast ” are subsidized for Service in the Persian Gulf — We have now had nearly four years’ experience of the working of this arrangement, and while cordially appreciating the complete co-operation and support which I have received from his Excellency Sir George Warrender and his predecessor Sir Edmund Poe, 1 realize that the Naval Commander-in-chief cannot perform impossibilities, and am of opinion that if present conditions are to continue, as it f-eems likely that they will, the require ments of the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf proper, and the Shatt-el-Arab cannot be adequately met by three ves? els now subsidized. Even at normal times, taking into account their minimum periods of absence for necessary service purposes, such as recommissioning, redocking and fitting and occasional and very necessary changes of air and scene for the officers and crews, it is clearly very hard for three ships to do the work required of them without undue strain; and if the concentration of ships on the Mekran coast in the winter months in connection with the arms traffic is to continue, the needs of the northern part of the Gulf will suffer greatly. At the present time, moreover, owing to the absence of any settled or effective Government in Tehran His Majesty’s Legation is perforce not in a position in connection with incidents arising in the Gulf to obtain satisfaction in Tehran by ordinary diplomatic means, and as His Majesty’s Government, for reasons which I well understand, have decided to refrain for the present from taking any drastic steps for asserting our position, it follows that, as in the recent case of the ill-treatment of a Bahreini at Lingah, I shall have to depend chiefly for maintaining our interests and good name in these waters upon what can be effected locally with the means ordinarily available. - It is very necessary therefore that I should not be deprived of the fortifying presence of one of His Majesty’s ships, within easy reach during the cold weather. 14. The Extension of Cable Communication in the Persian Gulf. —The proposal to connect Koweit and Bahrein with Bushire by cable or wireless installation is, 1 venture to hope, receiving favourable consideration, it would be a great advantage to connect up Lingah at the same time, or at all events British Bassidu with llenjam, Bassidu being within easy reach of Lingah. It would seem important also that His Majesty’s subsidized ships should be fitted with wireless as soon as possible. 15. Improved Representation on the Trucial Coast. —The experience of the last two or three years makes me doubt whether it is safe to leave these backward Sheikhs longer in the charge of a native agent. I shall shortly address Government a separate communication on the subject. 16. I have now mentioned the several means which in my view would materially promote our interests in this region. While doing so I quite realise that it may not be possible for Government to give lively consideration to them en bloc; at the same time I opine that the present junction is one at which our interests and future policy must necessarily be subjected to examination and discussion, and it may therefore be convenient that such measures as seem locally important and desirable should be on record before Government for such consideration as may be possible. A copy of this communication is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Legation. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) P. Z.
