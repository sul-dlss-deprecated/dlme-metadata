Dear Gibson, Thank you for your letter No.P.Z.3739/39 of the 19th of June, about the Italian claim in connection with the Muscat dhow wrecked off the coast of Italian Somaliland last year. The records available in this Department suggest that £232.2.10. was the estimated sterling equivalent of the Italian claim, but that, when the Kenya Government paid over the amount in lire, it was found to have cost £247. We are asking Kenya to confirm this. Yours sincerely,ions on this subject addressed to— Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l. and the following Number quoted: 38*38^/89 • ^ Downing Street. Sir, Ja&lt; 3739 1939 13 June, 1939. ULni m,D8K SECKSlARY OF ST'ATF, INDIA 0FFIC8. With reference to the letter from this Department No. 38382 of the 14th of December last, I am directed by Mr. Secretary MacDonald to request that you will bring before the Marquess of Zetland,. for his consideration, the question of the incidence of the expenditure which has been incurred by the Government of Kenya in re-imbursing to the Government of Italian Somaliland the cost of the assistance afforded by that Government to the crew and passengers of the Muscat dhow 'Galib” which was wrecked on the coast of Italian Somaliland in March of last year. 2. From the correspondence which was forwarded to you in the letter from this Department of the 7th of September last, it will be seen that the dhow was conveying a party of between 180 and 190 Muscat Arabs to Zanzibar and the Tanganyika Territory v/hen it was driven ashore and wrecked near Merca on the coast of Italian Somaliland. The occupants of the dhow were rescued by the Italian authorities and the whole party (wi th(with the exception of three passengers who desired to return to Arabia) was conveyed in Italian steamers, without cost to themselves, to Mombasa where they were permitted to land. Ihe majority of the party were subsequently conveyed, at the expense of the Government of Kenya, to Zanzibar, v/hile the remainder continued their journey to the Tanganyika Territory at their own expense. The expenditure incurred by the Italian authorities in the rescue and conveyance of the Arabs to Mombasa was £247, in respect of which amount a claim was made against the Government of Kenya. The expenditure incurred by the Government of Kenya in feeding and transporting the party which proceeded to Zanzibar amounted to £101. 2. 0. 5’rom the enclosed copy of a letter which v/as addressed by the Italian Consul-General at Nairobi to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Kenya it will be seen that it now appears to have been established that the dhow, which was stated to have been flying the British flag, had come from Muscat. A copy of the list of passengers referred to in the Consul-General’s letter is enclosed. 3. The Secretary of State has had under consideration the question of the authority froin whom re-imbursement of the amounts expended by the Governments of Kenya and Italian* Italian Somaliland should properly be claimed. In the meantime, hov/ever, he has agreed, on the strong recommendation of the Governor of Kenya, that the Italian claim should be met in the first instance from Kenya funds. In submitting his recommendation the Governor pointed out that the rescue was a friendly act by a foreign Government and that the expenditure had been incurred in assisting the occupants of a vessel which the Italians had every reason at the time to believe was British, and that their action in submitting their claim for re-imbursement of the expenditure incurred to the neighbouring British 'Government was therefore only reasonable, The Governor urged that it was undesirable to incur the risk, in so small a matter, of giving offence to a friendly neighbour by the prolonged delay v/hich would occur if settlement of the claim should have to await a final decision as to what authority was ultimately responsible for the expenditure. Accordingly the sum of £247 has been paid over to the Government of Italian Somaliland by the Government of Kenya, At the same time, the Governor has stated that it is felt strongly that it would be unfair if the Government of Kenya, which has no responsibility whatever for Muscat should have to bearwmm i bear the financial burden, and the payment from Kenya funds was made on the understanding that the question of obtaining re-imbursement from the appropriate authority would be pursued. 4. Mr. MacDonald feels that the action of the .A - - ♦ Government of Kenya in agreeing to meet the Italian claim in this way was highly commendable and that they have every reason to feel strongly that the financial burden incurred should not be allowed to remain with them. As is stated above it appears likely that the dhow had come from Muscat and,in the circumstances, Mr. MacDonald desires me to enquire whether Lord Zetland would be willing to approach the Sultan of Oman with a view to obtaining through him a refund of the amount involved, viz. £247. 5. Ihe Government of Kenya does not propose to seek re-imbursement of the sum of £102. 2. 0., spent on feeding the crew and passengers at Mombasa and in transporting the party which went on to Zanzibar.

The attempt was not successful on account of the bad conditions of the dhow which in such attempt was completely destroyed. 'There were on board 187 people as passengers and crew, who were partly sent to Mombasa by the coastal boat of the Lloyd Triestino and partly to Mogadiscio as they desired to return to Arabia.
