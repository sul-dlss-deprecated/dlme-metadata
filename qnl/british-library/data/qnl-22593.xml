FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. 16th March, 1934. ) lU v My dear Gilbert, I have beeri looking into the question of the Qatar boun^ries which is dealt with in your memorandum B 430, the latest revise of which I received a few days ago. Since the Foreign Office concurred in the terms of that memorandum there have, as you know, been various developnents, and we have also gone into the legal aspects of the question with our legal advisers more fully than was possible when the matter was first considered. As a result of this reconsideration of the matter, and also of the arguments advanced in Ryan's telegrams ITos. 8 Saving of February 14th, and 30 of March 5th (with which I may say we entirely agree), I think our present views would be as follows. 2. Perhaps the most important point which has emerged frcm our discussion with our Legal Advisers is that, in view of the fact that the 1913 line is 'adopted', and unmistakeably defined, in Article 3 of the 1914 Convention, which was duly ratified, that line is from the point of view of international law perfectly valid, so that we should be on strong legal ground in maintaining that it still marks the boundaries between Saudi Arabia, as one of the Ottonan succession States, and the territories in south-eastern Arabia with which His Majesty's Government are in special treaty relations. Tou will see that we have developed this point in paragraph 3 of our draft despatch to Angora enclosed in G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office. our//V 2. j\ r\ * \ ) \ nS f. our official letter Ho. S 1206/1206/91 of to-day's date to you. 3. A second point which has emerged is that the 1914 Convention speaks of the 'blue line as separating the Turkish territory from the 'territory' of Qatar, and not merely, as in the case of the 1913 Convention, from the ,? peninsula' of Qatar. \!v T 6 ai s now of opinion that this further strengthens our case for contending that the negotiators of the Convention intended to regard the territories to the east of the •'blue line' as politically appertaining to the Sheikhdom of Qatar and not merely as geographicalxy attached to the Qatar peninsula. This point seams to me important because, as I have said above, I personally entirely share Ryan's view that there will oe litt-ie or no hope of getting Ibn Saud to accept a frontier, so uo speak, against a vacuum, and that, if we are to maintain the 'blue line' as a real and valid boundary, it will be essential to take up some positive attitude aoouu the political status of the territory to the east ol it. 4. In this connexion it is perhaps relevant to note that Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda does not merely commit Ibn Saud to maintaining peaceful relations with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the On an coast, but also constitutes a clear recognition by him of the special treaty relations of His Majesty's Government with those Sheikhs - a recognition which seems to me to preclude Ibn Saud frcm himself acquiring or claiming any kind of overlordship or suzerainty over those Sheikhs or over any territory which, we can reasonably claim to fall within their sphere. It seems to me in fact that Article 6 of the Treaty/of protection which was drawn up at the Middle East Official Suh-Committee meeting of February 23rd, and that we then agreed that the Question of the landward limit of the prop sed Qatar oil concession ana. oi the proposed guarantee of protection to the Sheikh should be dealt with independently of the Question of tn® political boundaries of the Sheikhdom. 7, While for all these reasons our present attitude is that we should maintain the ''blue line' against Ibn Saud and leave him in no further doubt as to our claim to regard the area to the •ast ol it as falling within our sphere, it would of course be for consideration whether it may not be desirable eventually to offer him some concession in this area, particularly if it turns out that tribes to the east of the 'blue line do in fact owe him definite allegiance. This possibility is considered in conclusion (c)(i) of your memorandum, but I think that it is now clear that if we are eventually to establish any modified line, we shall first have to establish our rights up to the 'blue line', since otherwise we shall have nothing to give away or bargain with. In this connexion it is perhaps worth noting that, according to Dixon's latest report, of which you sent us a copy in your letter P.Z.1177/34, of 7th March, the Bay of Salwa appears to extend further to the south than is shown on our 1;1 ,000 ,000 maps. This seems to be borne out by Philby's (1:2,000,000) 1932 map, published in the Geographical Journal of January 1933, where the Bahr-as- Salwa 19 shown in detail as extending southwards to a latitude hardly north of that of the Khor -al-Odaid. It may thus be that, when the area is properly surveyed, it will be found that a strict interpretation of the 'blue line'/' A 5. line' vjould cut off a very long and very narrow strip of coast to the west of Salwa Bay from the rest of Hasa, and that a far more satisfactory and reasonable line could be drawn from the southern end of the Bahr-as-Salwa in a southerly direction, which would in fact start from much the same point as a line drawn across the base of the Peninsula. This would much reduce the extent of the uncertain area and might offer the possibility of various eventual compromises for the northern end of the line, which we could perhaps discuss at Tuesday's meeting. Incidentally it may be worth considering having the Bahr- as-Salwa re -surveyed, so that we may know exactly where it does in fact end. But this is perhaps mainly a point for the Service departments. 8. In the circumstances described above our present attitude therefore is that we should, not only firmly make cur stand on the 'blue line' at the outset, but that we should put forward a positive claim, preferably on behall of the Sheikh of Qatar, to the territory extending light up to the northern portion of it. If this seems likely to lead to serious difficulty,we could eventually compromise by agreeing to some line running south from the head of Salwa Bay. Meanwhile, the view of my higher authorities here is that everything points to our having to make a very early communication about these frontiers, not only to the Americans,as proposed in our letter No.E.1806/1206/91 referred to above, but also to Ibn Saud himself, ii we are to avoid a great deal of trouble later on. 9.

Z.628/34 of 1st February, 1934, on the subject of an oil concession in C^atar, and of the proposal to give an undertaking of protection to the Sheikh in return for the grant him of a concession to a British oil company, I am co imanded 'by the Air Council to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that although the subject has recently received consideration by the GoTern ent, it seems desirable to the Council to record their views on the question of policy raised, and their answers to the specific questions asked in the letter under reference. 2. In view of the importance to British interests of retaining the special position^of His I ajesty's Govern -ent in these regions the Council are in agreement with the proposal that an assurance of protection in suitable terms should be given to the Sheikh, subject to certain safeguards and to the provision of the facilities necessary to implement it. They regard it as of great importance that any such assurance should not tontain an undertaking to do more than could in fact be done with the resources available» 3. In the view of the Council, the contingencies against which protection might actually be required may be summed up rg follows:- (i) formal attack by Ibn Saud, or by some other Power, with the object of capturing the country. (ii) Large scale tribal invasion frcm Bejd, either ostensibly unauthorised by Ibn Saud j or such as might occur if Saudi Arabia should disintegrate after the death of Ibn Saud. he Under Secretary of State, India Office, Whitehall, S.W«1,2, (i) (iii) Minor raiding, 4* The Council are fully mindful of the deterrent effect which would result if it were made generally known that His Majesty 1 s Govermaent would 'be pre ared to support the Sheikh in the event of his being attacked. They must observe ? however, that these contingencies all relate to aggression by land from the hinterland; and that in these circumstances it is inevitable that the protective measures, apart from the provision of such detachments as it might 'be necessary and practicable to land from His Majesty's Varships for local defence of towns and aerodromes, and of such other land forces as it might be found practicable to send from elsewhere, must devolve upon the air forces normally located in Iraq.. These forces, however, are situated a long distance from Q.atar, to which they would have to proceed by a route where the possibility of delays due to climatic conditions cannot be overlooked.. Again, these forces, which are already below the strength which the Council have long regarded as necessary in the Middle East, have to meet an ever increasing number and diversity of calls upon them, including reinforcement of distant theatres; and the Council certainly could not undertake that they would be available under all circumstances to deal with contingencies in Hatar, These difficulties would for a|il practical purposes be overcome if a Royal Air Force Squadron were located at Bahrein, but the Council assume that the importance of the issue involved is not in itself such as to justify the provision of such an additional unit, and therefore do not at present propose to suggest such an increase. 6. Under these conditions the Air Council take the view that the nature and limits of the protection whicn mig/it be given if the forces are available, are as follows:-I % 3. (i) While of course no attempt would be made to set up any physical 'barrier at the frontier^ the threat of the pressure which, in various forms, His Majesty's Government could apply against Ibn Saud would deter him from openly launching a large scale attack on - • Qatar. It is probable that it is against this contingency that the Sheikh of Qatar would most value an undertaking on our part, and the Council consider that in normal circumstances it should be possible to implement a guarantee to this effect. (ii) Given an adequate air intelligence organisation, it is probable that sufficient warning of anything in the nature of a large scale tribal invasion would be received in time to permit of British ITaval and Air forces being moved up to take action to disperse it and to strengthen the local defence. (iii) It would not be practicable to prevent raids on a smaller scale by highly mobile raiding parties which might number a few hundreds. 7. She Council consider that any guarantee given should be subject to the following safeguards;- (i) Unprovoked Aggression It must be made clear that His Majesty 1 s Government could not permit themselves to be drawn into intervention owing to lack of proper control by the Sheikh over his own tribesmen or by the adoption of provocative action on his own part on the presumption of support from His Majesty's Government. He must be prepared to follow the advice of His Majesty 1 s Government in his attitude towards his neighbours. (ii) Local Protection For defence against minor raids the Sheikh should provide the necessary local defence forces and forts or other works necessary himself. It may be presumed however that he already does this in his own interests in the normal course. Care, however, will be necessary to ensure that as a result of receiving any promise of support from ourselves he does not relax these protective measures. (iii) Boundarie s 0?he Council understand that the boundaries of Qatar are not as yet defined and consider that it mil be important to define the boundaries to v/hich the assurance of protection is in fact to apply. (iv) means of implementing; the commitment From the air standpoint it is essential (a) that aircraft should be free to fly over Qatar in order that pilots may be familiar with the country; and (b) that when itmls necessary to take air action the aircraft shall be free to attack those objectives most likely to give the required results and shall not tie confined within the boundaries of the Sheikh's territories. B./I 4. fq 'A 8. In order to enable the Royal Air Force to take their part in implementing a guarantee of protection it will be necessary for the Sheikh to grant certain facilities. Details of these have already been furnished in deni official correspondence between the Air Ministry and the India Office. 9. Prompt and efficient intelligence is essential to successful air action. At present the necessary intelligence resources in Qatar do not exist and it would be assential that the Sheikh should grant permission for an intelligence officer to reside, if necessary, in Q,atar; and in any event to allow him or his assistants freedom to travel in Qatar and to establish and use ?//$ communications in that country. 10. As regards expenditure, the Council naturally cannot at this stage give a firm estimate. On the assumption, however, that no additional units are required, the expenditure would be limited to provision of the minor air facilities and the additional intelligence resources referred to above and, in the event of air operations, smch expenditure as these normally entail. Past experience, however, of such operations does not lead the Air Oouncil to regard this expenditure as likely to be excessive. 11.

W. Hendel Foreign Office, Mr. F. 0. Starling Petroleum Department. Mr, E, A, Seal Admiralty. Mr, J • G, //alt on ) Mr, J^ ,G, Laithwaite ) India Of fi ce . Mr. G, E, Grombie ) Mr.Agnew Royal Dutch Shell. Mr. A, C. Hearn Anglo-Persian Oil Company, G omm er c i al Agr e erne nt. It was agreed that a clause should 'be inserted in Art, 14 of the Commercial Agreement on the lines of Art, 11 A(c) of the Koweit Agreement providing for termination of the concession by the Sheikh if the Company should be in default, under the Arbitration provisions of Art.16, Relations between A.P,0,C., Royal Dutch Shell and Iraq Petroleum Company . Mr,Rendel put forward a suggestion which had been previously made by him on behalf of the Foreign Office, namely that if the formal Agreements with the Sheikh and «ith H .M .G. were made in the name of the A.P.O.C. only and if, when these were put before the Board of the I,P.O., the I.P.C., objected to their terms, they might claim that the A .P.O.C. had exceeded its powers and that the/2. the Agreements were ultra vi res under the I .P. G.Oil Agreenient; on the other hand if the Royal Dutch Shell were brought in now as a party to the Agreements, the I.P.C, could not legitimately object to Agreements made by two of its constituents or to the concession being worked by the A.P.O.C* and the Royal Dutch Shell. Mr.Agnew explained that even two- constituent groups of the I .P.O. were not allowed to negotiate for a concession within the Red Line without the approval of the I.P• 0# Board which, in this case, the A.P.O.C. had already obtained, the question having been discussed informally with the I.P.O. at group meetings- It had been left to the A.P.O.C. to get a concession in this area and the A.P.O.C.exploration licence in Qatar was held on behalf of the I.P.O. The A.P.O.G. had been afraid that if none of the other constituents of the I.P.O. agreed to come in they might be left with a concession on their hands which, under the terms of the Oil Agreement, they would be unable to work themselves without the participation of some other constituent group. The Royal Dutch Shell had accordingly agreed to participate with the A.P.C.C. in working any concession that might be obtained and the French group had said that anything which proved acceptable to the A.P.O.G. and the Royal Dutch Shell would be acceptable to them. Mr. Agnew thought, therefore, that the formation of a Shell A.P.O.C. group would be tactically undesirable at this stage since it would appear to the other constituents of the I.P.O. as a sort of all-British front. In view of this explanation the meeting agreed that in spite of the rather informal nature of the present arrangements between the A.P.O.C. and the I.P.O. it wo^ld be preferable on the whole that the Agreements should be made in the name of the A.P.O.G. only. The desirability/desirability of informing tiie Sheikh that the A.P.O.G. were acting on behalf of the I•P.O. was also discussed* It was agreed that the Sheikh could have no formal ground of complaint in this respect in view of Art ,12 of the Commercial Agreement and Sir Louis Kershaw suggested that the position might suitably be explained to him informally by Col. Fowle at a later stage. It was not anticipated that there would be any difficulty with the Sheikh on this point, •The meeting then turned to consider the terms of the draft Government Agreement. Article 1 was acceptable to the Companies. Nationality of subsidiary Companies . Article 2. Mr. Agnew saw great difficulty in the provision that subsidiary Companies should be registered in Great Britain since this would involve a liability for U.K. taxation. Under the constitution of the I.P.C. its subsidiaries might be of any nationality. He did not think that the French and American groups would mind subsidiary Companies being registered in Great Britain except for the fact that this would involve them in double taxation to which they very naturally objected. The Shell and the A.P.O.G. cared nothing themselves for this point since they were in any case liable to U.K.taxation. Sir Louis Kershaw suggested that this tax liability might be an additional reason for the foreign elements izi the I.P.C. not wanting to participate in the concession, but Mr. Agnew said that the jealousies within the Board of the I.P.C. were such that there was no prospect of the two British gr oup s/groups being allowed to take up any concession without the others participating. They might complain vigorously about its terms but they would, come in nevertheless. Mr. Starling and Mr. Seal suggested that this might be a reason for insisting on U.K. registration in spite of the taxation difficulties and Mr. Rendel explained that since any conditions imposed in the Government Agreement must be of universal application, H .M .G. could not rnaJce them easier for the A.P.O.C. - I.P.O. than for example a purely American Company. Mr. Hearn and Mr. Agnew said that if H.M.G. made things difficult for foreigners in British territor British Oil Companies would be faced with retaliation in foreign territory and referred to their present negotiations with the Syrian Governnent, but Mr.Rendel pointed out that there was no analogy between the mandated territory of Syria and Qatar which was not British territory and where there were sx^ecial difficulties in regard to protection of foreigners. It was finally agreed, however, that in view of the taxation difficulty, the registration of subsidiary Companies in the United Kingdom might be dispensed with but that any subsidiary should be registered in the British Empire and that its chairman should at all times be a British subject. Articles 3,4,5,and 6 of the draft Agreement were acceptable to the Oil Companies. Mr.Walton explained with reference to Article 4 that it was possible that H.M.G. might decide to designate the Political Agent, Bahrein as Political Agent also in Qatar and Article 4 as drafted would cover this though in so far as the P.A. might/5. might not be resident in Qatr the obligation to conduct local relations through the Political Representative of H.M.G. vjould in practice have to be interpreted rather more loosely, Mr. Agneuv and Mr. Hearn took note of this and saw no objection. It was agreed that words to the following effect should be added to the third paragraph of Article 6 of the Qatar Oommercial Agreement:- 'and in times of national emergency the Sheikh shall have full use free of charge of the Company's wireless and telegraph installations and railways for g o v e rnine nt al purposes,' and that a new Article 7 identical with Article 7 of the Koweit Government Agreement should be incorporated in the Qatar Government Agreement. Articles 7 and 8 were acceptable to trie Companies. Hefining. ■ii ■■■ ■ n—iriii Article 9 . Mr.Agnew said that in view of the international character of the I.P.G. the Government Agreement would soon become known all over the world and if any refining clause were included in it foreigners would impose it on British Oil Companies in foreign countries. It was true that a clause such as that in the Koweit Agreement i^ould not involve the Company in any definite obligation vis-a-vis H.M.G., but South American Republics would use a similar clause as a means for getting at the Companys bank balance. Oil Companies always preferred to refine at the point of production if possible so that a refining clause on the lines of the Koweit Agreement could not mean much to the Government but it would mean a great deal to/' .1 6 • to the Company and niight have diastrous results on British interests elsewhere, tie thought that H.M.G^s real safeguard lay in the existence of the British groups in the I.P.G. Sir Louis Kershavj enquired whether the same difficulties were not to be feared from the clause in the Kovieit Agreement, hut Mr, Hearn hoped that since only two Companies were interested in this the clause would not become widely known. Mr. Starling said that H.M .G. were at present negotiating with various foreign countries and trying to get them to agree that they should impose no conditions on British Oil Companies which were not imposed on other Oil Companies. Having in mind these negotiations he felt inclined to agree generally with what Mr.Agnew had said. Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty were somewhat perturbed at the very small number of refineries in British territory in view of the difficulties which might arise in time of war in obtaining oil for the Navy from neutral countries. The Admiralty particularly desired that there should be more refineries in British territory in Asia. He said that it was a well established British policy to ensure if possible that oil should be refined in British territory and he suggested, and Mr, Starling agreed that this policy was well known abroad. Sir Louis Kershaw also doubted whether the omission of a refining clause from the present agreement would really make it much easier for British Companies vis-a-vis, for example, South American Republics who might produce earlier documents which contained conditions regarding refining. There was, for example, the/I' ) 7. the standing exair.ple of Trinidad where not less than 50 of the oil had to be refined locally. Mr&gt;Agnevj , however, thought that a modern Agreement made in London might have great weight, and he mentioned that British Companies were coming up against this difficulty more and more in their relations with foreign countries. They would rather give H .M .G# their safeguard in some other way than in a formal public document, Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty felt that in Qatar they might go rather further in insisting on their refining desiderata than in Eoweit though, if course, they would not press the Company beyond reason . Mr. Agnew suggested as a possible solution that the I.P.O. might be asked to give H.M.G, a letter saying that the Company would be prepared at all times to discuss with H.M.G. the question of refining and that H.M.G* would have the right as soon as production in Qatar amounted to a modern refining unit to ask the Company to erect a refinery. He explained that this would mean the erection of a refinery when production reached say 2,000 tons a day or 700,000 tons a year. They would expect H.M.G. to treat them reasonably in regard to this obligation if it proved impossible to find a market for the oil. At all costs he wished to avoid the appearance of a refining clause ii/a formal Agreement. Sir Louis Kershaw asked whether this letter would be obtained before the Government Agreement was signed. Mr. Agnew said he thought it would be best that the letter should be sent say a month after the signature of the Government Agreement but that a guarantee might be obtained before signature of the Agreement that such a letter would be forthcoming. He/8 He could not of course commit the I.P.O. to this proposal at tiie present meeting and Mr&gt; Seal added that neither could he commit the Admiralty, but it was agreed that the proposal should be considered further by the Admiralty and by the Companies and that the Companies should prepare a draft of a letter such as had been mentioned. Mr, Agnew said that in the event of this proposal being accepted by both parties he would put it informally to the American and French representatives of' the I.P.G, in London without however prejudicing in his conversations with them the terms of the Government Agre erne nt •CONFIDENTIAL.

I am worried over the more general question of ibr» Saudis relatione with +he Crucial Shaikhs. in his memorandum of January 26, paragraph 11, la it hwai te refers incidentally to the Exercise (by ibn Sauc- ) as at present of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence -of which we ignore'. Ought we not perhaps to watch more closely the info anal influence, which has become so patent in the case of the Shaikh of Qatar since his visit last year to Riyadh? Ought we not to keep a more definite record of observable contacts, eg. the vi sits of members of the ruling families tc Mecca and, if possible, to ibn Jilxiwi in Has a? Ought we to ignore quite so readily money payments, which, if regular, can only appear in Arab eyes as tribute to an over-lord? I do not call to mind off hand any pavment except those made by the Shaikh of Qatar. If there are others, it would oe useful to know of them» IDven as regards the Shaikh of Qatar the information seems to be sketchy, in 1930 Prior reported very confident i ally (see the enclosures in your P.L. (IS,4861/4861/91J of September 12, 1930) that the Shaikh admitted to paying a secret subsidy of Rupees 100,000 a year to Ibn Saud„ He was then anxious about the fnature of/r -3- future of his independence and he sems to have got the wind up again in 1932, ahen he asked for a guarantee of British protection against landward aggression, i have not pot the papers regarding this request and tbe answer to it, so i do not know whether he renewed his intiimtion that, 'if I cannot 'be helped, 1 shall have to seek some other way rt « 1 do not recall any further mention of the subsidy as such hut in 1933 attention was drawn several tines to a financial transaction involving a sum of 10,000 rupees or pounds. 411 the versions in 1933 represented this as money owed 'by Ibn 3aud tc the Shaikh. -Now we have well-infomed holmes caning along len closure in your La-No.53j and saying that the Shaikh is well off hut has to ray sums estimated at £ 10,000 a year to Bin Saud and that the reason for his being summoned to Hiyadh was that he lad neglected the payment for two years., 1 suggest for consideration t*:e following questions (a) Has the Shaikh of Q,atar been for some time before 1930 a tributary of Ibio Saud? (b) Was his journey to Riyadh 4 'he result o^nis seeking th e other way ', whi ch he foreshad owed in 19 3(^, and whi ch may have appeared to him all the more necessaiy after the refusal of British protection in 19 32, if he was in arrear with hi s tribute 9 (cj Is it not at least possible that, when at Riyadh, the Shaikh agreed to some territorial settlement with Ibn Saud, 6ven though it is hard to believe that he can' have gone so far as suggested in the report in Bowie's Express Letter, ^Oo-1957^3 of December 2S?

On tne Hnd April aoout 11•UO nours ^naiKn 'Abaullan bin ! asini, rtitii rhaiiois f Ali and Haiaadjand Salm bin Mani* caaie on board to call upon tne Political Resident. Tiie meeting was, purposely, made gloomy, une inaikn asKed ii tnere was news about Bin 8a 1 ud and 'Asir - and was told the contents ol the telegram trom Jedda ol . He left under salute. %• At lb.00 hours on tne same day the Political hesicient returned the HhaiKh's call (under salute}, and a stormy inter view ensued. Business was mooted almost at once ana the Political Hesident informed the ShaiKh that,as ne (the b'haiich} knew ne had just been i to Delhi; that he had told the Government of his (the Shaiich T sj sg arrangements with Bin c:a ? ud and that tne Uovernment of India, and also His majesty's Government, were very angry. The Shaxich denied hotly that he had made arrangements ^ith Bin ' a'ud,but was reminded that he had himself statea that ne had. Later,however,ne tooK the line that he could not help maKing arrangements otherwise he would be swallowed up. He said that he had no made payments, but the denial was nalf-nearted | and he avoided the point as isr as possible. ?lhen pressed on tne subject of his breach of the Treaty,he threatened to leave ^tar (a characteristically Arab threat,to which they attach an immense importance, which it entirely lacKs in western eyes). He burst out at one moment that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were the cause of his misfortunes. After a very stormy discussion,it became late and it was arranged that the discussion should be resumed next morning. ■ IfLOn the morning ot the 3r(l April the Political h'esiaent and the Political Agent landed at 10.GO hours ana saw the yhaiich, his sons (and Salih al Mana^at the Qasr. The Political Kesident asKeei the bhaiich if he had anything to add to what had been said on the previous daj, but he had not. The Political Kesident recapitulated what had been said, and then brought forward the further point that His Majesty 's Government regarded the survey as part and parcel of a concession and that tney would not allow him to give permission for a survey. The whole matter was again placed briefly before tne Shaiich, who asked if the Political Kesident would give it in writing, to which the Political hesident said that he certainly would, tnougii he warned the Shaikh that any such letter would contain a state ment of the displeasure of His Majesty's Government. It was arranged to go off to write tne letter and to return in the after noon with it. f^hile waiting for the boat,the Political Agent,with the approval of the Political iiesident, put into the ear ol ; alih al Mana*, that,as an old frienQ,he tooic tne opportunity of saying that His majesty's Government were very angry and that his personal advice to b'hai&amp;h ♦Abdullah was that, when he got the letter, he should try to come to some arrangement acceptable to His majesty*s uovernment. He added that liis majesty's government would certainly protect the shaikh and tnat they would doubtless |) also help him to see that he got good terms from the Uompany. The Political Agent hmtea that His Majesty's Government were not angry with him alone. The Political Agent concluded by saying that 'the people' now often say that His majesty's Government use nothing but words, but that in this case it was not mere words. At I d .30 hours tne political Kesiaent and tne political /AgentA^ent returned to tU6 C .&amp;sr anci tlie letter was read over and hand^ ed to the tJUaiicii. The biiaiica swore tiiax lie had made no arrangement over the oil with ijm &amp;a f ud and the Political r;esiuexu accepted nis statement. In the course of discussion the question ol wnat tne Ehaikh considered his boundarj came up- He gave the line which was on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's map, but explained that in the past an area Iroai just north of Khor al Odaia to the Sabaicbah al ^atti had been neutral ground between him. and Abu Luabi 9 but that it was now claimed by Bin tSa'ud. The area and boundary were indicated on s rough sketch map. The Political resident then again went through the position ana said that as things now stood the Shaikh could not give a concession to the Hasa Company and asked what would happen it, as the Shaikh suggested, he gave it to no one - would not his family and people resent the throwing away of ^ood sioney* it was also explained that the inglo-Persian Oil Company here was not merely the T Abadan Company,but represented a mixed Company,with American,French and Dutch interests,as well as British. It was emphasised that the Hasa Company was purely American and that,therefore,His Majesty's Government would not assent to the Shaikh giving them the Concession. Some discussion then ensued as to whether a bridge could not be made between what the Shaikh asked for and wnat the Company oflered. In the course of the conversation it was made clear that His Majesty's Government would not allow the concession to be given to the Hasa Company and would, in consequence, do their best to secure as good terms as possible for him from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. it was finally suggested that discussion should be re-opened the next morning, but the Shaikh saio that he wished for time to /thing1 tiiinis:, so that it was arranged for the Politicai Resident anci the Political Agent to come oft in the afternoon* it is worth nothing thet an impression which one gets verj strongly is that it took an appreciable time, and only the written letter convinced them, lor the Shaikh and his party to realise that His Majesty's Government might be in earnest and not merely speaking 'words'.■ V On the 4tii April 1^34 at Ib.UU hours the Political Resident snd the Political Agent saw the Shaikh, his sons, T Ali and Hamad, and Sslih al Mana f at the ^asr* The Political Resident asked the Shaikh whether he had any reply to the letter which had been hanaed to him. The Shaikh produced a written reply which was read out to Salih al Mana f and handed to the Political Resident. Some discussion took place which was led round to whether it was possible to find a bridge between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Shaikh. In particular he was asked whether he had re.uested the Company to pay him an higher royalty instead of a lump sum and a royalty. He said that he had not done so. The Political Agent said that it appesred tnat his demands were higher than those made in the case of the Bahrain Concession,to which the Shaiim replied that he did not know about that. He said that he thought that the money would not come out of the pockets of the Company,but that their profits would be so large that they could easily afford to pay him five lakhs a year in addition to the royalties. It appeared,however, tnat it was impossible to pyeeeed persuade him that there was any necessity to lower Ms terms and it was not, of course, possible to go anything which might commit the Company to increase theirs, though the Political Resident said that we would do what was possible to see that he receives good terms, should he give the Concession to the ijiglo-Fersian Oil Company. It was also emphasised that if he did not give it to tne Anglo- Persian Oil Company he would not give it to anyone and then Q^tar would loose all the benefits from oil and the Political Besident asked what would his relatives think if he looses good money. the Tne conversation then turned on to/boundaries of Qatar. The Shaikh reiterated that his boundary was as on the Anglo- Persian Oil Company^ map. He said that there was a neutral zone between him and Abu Dhabi from Khor al Odaid to the /oabaktahi Sabak)6ah al Matti which was neutral,but that of recent years Bin Sa f ud had ciaimed it as his own ana coliected za^at there. Bin Sa 'ud had also ooilected zaicat m the desert from Hasa to the east and fcasu* there were small Akhwan settlements at Sabak aiid at Mabaic* r i ! he lormer being only two or three houses and the latter a settlement (though the size was not ascertained In speaking oi the collection of zaica^the Shaixh emphasised that Bin Sa f ud collected it 'as he is strong enough to do this'. The Shaikh emphasised at various points his tear ot danger trom Bin Sa'ud and tribes now under Bin Sa*ud t s influence. The conversation reverted in very general terms to tne question of tne concession and the Political Resident wound up by saying that the door was rt masdud ?, but not 'manful'. It was then explained to the Shaixh that we should go away in the Ship tnat evening and that perhaps either the Political Resident or the Political Agent slight return later on or that he could write to us il ne had anytning to say.difficulty Bin Sand's pernios ion to bring \% into uee in He.jd, Agent her nas given me a map Bheet prepared by ge-ologistc which glvee nothing away but suggests that survey is planned on an aabitloue ecale.

Bliie Line'' laid down in 1913 and 1914 inglo-Turkish Conventions 4 . 2. Text of these Conventions is being communicated to United Staters Embassy in Angora in response to recent enquiry and United States Government will thus soon know that His Majesty 1 s Government regard Blue Line as eastern boundary of Saudi AraDia-.., They ^ili presumably pass on this information to Standard Oil Company of California who will thus have no excuse for regarding their concession from Bin Saud as giving them any rights east of that Line, 3, Moreover if any limit is to be put co extension or consolidation oi Bin Saud's informally exercised authority towards east and risk is to be avoidea ol his gradually establishing a claim to hinterland and even to coastal districts of Arab territories in special relations with His Majesty's Government, Blue Line affords only valid and legal basis for any boundary at all between British and Saudi spheres in South-Eastern Arabia f Question may at any moment become acute owing to oil or air developments and objections to leaving ig2. indeterminate any longer are therefore serious, 4* On the other hand while this issue may in any event have to be faced before long His Eajesty's Government are reluctant to risk unnecessarily prowking a major dispute with Bin Saud particularly when he is already in difficulties with Imam of Yemen. Moreover if as a result of such challenge to his position, Bin Saud while outwardly maintaining friendly relations, were to endeavour to stir up desert tribes against Shaikhs of Qatar or (less probably) Abu Dhabi the resulting situation- might be difficult since His Majesty's Government while under no formal obligation to defend them by land might have to consider lending them assistance. Pending completion of necessary organisation in Qatar (which muo. await general agreement with Shaikh about oil concession and proposed guarantees of protection) this would be most difficult. There is also danger that Bin Saud when faced with possibility of having to accept Blue Line might intrigue to strengthen his informal influence in Qatar or Ttucial Shaikhdoms. Possibility must also not be overlooked that Bin Saud might react to challenge by intensifying his impenetration of hinterland of ratal' and Trucial Shaikhdoms e.g. by creation of further Akhwan settlements or by asserting his supremacy over deeaet tribes; although we might he in a stronger position diplomatically in regard to this if we had previously made our view of his eastern boundary clear to him as suggested in para. 7 below. 5 It is impossible from here to estimate importanceo O c&gt; 854a or reality of these dangers but it seems desirable to examine them fully in order to leave no possible f a o u OX' o li u o i.. a c u o oix ■ &amp; Main object of His Majesty's Government is to prevent risk of danger of minunderstanding with America o?:* other interests in the event of oil being found in areas concerned and to maKe sure that minor Arab Rulers with whom His Majesty 5 s Government are in special Treaty relations do not fall under Bin Saud^ domination f( Recent report from Kuwait on extension of Bin Saud-s influence in Qatar peninsular (see Kuwait Despatch No.C 17 of January 13th to Political Resident) shows that danger is serious c 7. Alternatives appear to be (a) to take no initiative with Bin Sana for one present but to rely (1) on U.S. Government informing Standard Oil Company of California of position (2) on Company not attempting to extend its sphere of operations east oi. Blue mine and (3) on Bin Saud refraining lor the present from attempts further to extend or consolidate his informal influence eastwaxcU (V; to take some action which would make ou. views and position clear to Bin Saud without4., 854 1 constituting a direct challenge to his position. This would be done by merely informing him of U.S. Embassy ! s reouest for copies of Mglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 and of our reply. Diplomatic discussions could then be allowed to take their course and question could if necessary be considered of what concessions could be made to Bin Saud., (c) to make a formal communication to Bin Saud on the subject of the 'Blue Line'' which he could not ignore and which he would probably regard as a challenge and feel bound to take up.., 8o None of the above courses is free from difficulty but I incline to course (b) as offering best opportunity of making necessary communication to Bin Saud in least contentious manner.

It was agreed that a clause should be inserted in Art, 14 of the Commercial Agreement on the lines of Art, 11 A(c) of the Koweit Agreement providing for termination of the concessi on by the Sheildi if the Company should be in default under the Arbitration provisions of Art.16. Relations be tween A.P.O.C., Royal Dutch Shell a.nd fra'q Petroleum Company . Mr. Rendel explained a suggestion which had been previously made by him namely that if the f ormal Agreements with the Sheikh and with I-I.M.G. were made in the name of the A.P,O.C. only and if, when these were put before the Board of the I.P.C., the I.P.O. objected to their terms, they might claim that the A.P.O.C. had exceeded its powers and/and that the Agreements were ultra yjres under the I.P.C. Oil Agreement; on the other hand if the Hoye.1 Dutch Shell were brought in now as a party to the Agreements, the I.P.C. could not:., legitimately object to Agreements made by two of its constituents or to the concession being worked by the A.P.0.0. and the Royal Dutch Shell if the I.P.C. decided not to take up the concession. Mr, Agnew explained that even two constituent groups of the I.P.C. were not allowed to negotiate for a concession within the Red Line without the approval of the I.P.C. Board which, in this case, the A.P.O.C. had already obtained, the question having been discussed informally with the I.P.C. at group meetings. It had been left to the A.P.O.C. to get a concession in this area and the A.P.O.C, exploration licence in Qatar was held on behalf of the I.P.C. The A.P.O.C. had been afraid that if none of the other constituents of the I.P.C. agreed to come in they might be left with a concession on their hands which, under the terms of the Oil Agreement, they would be unable to work themselves without the particination of some other constituent group. The Royal Dutch Shell had accordingly agreed to participate with the A.P .O.C, in working any concession that might be obtained and the French group had said that anything which proved acceptable to the A.P.O.C. and the Royal Dutch Shell would be acceptable to them. Mr. Agnew thought, -chereioie,, that the formation of a Shell A.P.O.C. group would be tactically undesirable at this stage since it would appear to the other constituents of the I.P.C. as a sort oi all- British front. In view of this explanation the meeting agreed tha o in spite of the rather informal nature of the present arrangements between the A.P.O.C. and the I.t.C. it ,.ovuJ be preferable on the whole that the Agreements should be made in the name of the A.P.O.C. only. The desirability/desirability of informing the Sheikh that the A.P.O.G. were acting on behalf of the I.P.C. xms also discussed. It was agreed that the Sheikh could have no formal ground of complaint in this respect in view of Art,12 of the Commercial Agreement and Sir Louis Kershavy suggested that the position might suitably be explained to him informally by Col. Fowle at a later stage. It mas not anticipated that there would be any difficulty with the Sheikh on this point* The meeting then turned to consider the terms of the draft Government Agreement. Article 1 was acceptable to the Companies. Nationality of subsidiary Gompenles . Article 2. Mr. Agnew saw great difficulty in the provision that subsidiary Companies should be registere in Great Britain since this would involve a liability for U.K. taxation. Under the constitution of the I.P.O its subsidiaries might be of any nationality. He did not t hi ilk that the French and American groups would mind subsidiary Companies being registered in Great Britain except for the fact that this would involve them in double taxation to which they very naturally objected. The Shell and the A.P.O.G. oared nothing themselves for this point since they were in any case liable to U.K.taxation. Sir Louis Kershaw suggested that this tax liability might be an additional reason for the foreign elements in the I.P.C. not wanting to participate in the concession, but Mr. Agnew said that the jealousies within the Board of the I.P.C, were such that there was no prospect of the two British gr cup s/4. groups 'being allowed to take up any concession without the others participating. They might complain vigorously about its terms 'but they would come in nevertheless. Mr. Starling and Mr. Seal suggested that this might be a reason for insisting on U .K. registration in spite of the taxation difficulties and Mr. Rendel explained that since any conditions imposed in the Government Agreement must be of universal application, H.M.G. could not make them easier for the A.P.O.C. - I.P.O. than for example a purely American Company, Mr. Hearn and Mr. Agnow said that if H .M .G. made things difficult for foreigners in British territory, British Oil Companies would be faced with retaliation in foreign territory and referred to their present negotiations with the Syrian Government, but Mr. Rendel pointed out that there was no analogy between the mandated territory of Syria and the independent Sheikhdom of Qatar which was not British territory and where there were special difficulties in regard to protection of foreigners. It was finally agreed, however, that in view of the taxation di..iicul cj, the registration of subsidiary Companies in the united Kingdom might be dispensed with but thau any subsiaid-ry should be registered in the British Empire and that its chairman should at all times be a British subject. Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the draft Agreement were acceptable to the Oil Companies. Mr. Walton explained with reference to Article 4 that it was possible that H.M.G. might decide to designate the Political A^ent, Bahrein as Political Agent also in Qatar and Article 4 as drafted would cover this though in so far as the P. A. might/I5, might not be resident in Qatar the obligation to conduct local relations through the Political Representative of H.M.G. would in practice have to do inteipie ^ed latner more loosely, Mr, Agnew and l /Ir, jOo ^' v note oi. this and sstv no objection, I l/ das agreed uhat yjords to the follov»ing effect should be added to the third paragraph of Article 6 of the Qatar Commercial Agreement:- 'and in times of national emergency the Sheikh shall have full use free of charge of the Company's wireless and telegraph installations and railways for governmental purposes,' and that a new Article 7 identical with Article 7 of the Koweit Government Agreement should be incorporated in the 'Qatar Government Agreement. Articles 7 and 8 were acceptable to the Companies. Eefining . Article 9 , Mr. Agnew said that in view of the international character of the I,P,G, the Government Agreement would soon become known all over the world and if any refining clause were included in it ioreigners would impose a corresponding clause on British Oil Companies in foreign countries. It was true that a clause such as that in the K owe it Agreement would not involve the Company in any definite obligation vis-a-vis H.M.G., but South American Republics would use a similar clause as a means for getting at the Company 1 s bank balance. Oil Companies always preferred, it possible, t refine at the point of production so that a refining clause on the lines of the ICoweit Agreement could not really give any tangible advantage to the Government, but it would mean a great deal to/6. to the Company and might have diastrous results on British interests elsewhere. He thought that H.M.G's real safeguard lay in the existence of the British groups in the I.p•C• Sir Louis Kershaw enquired whether the same difficulties were not to be feared from the clause in the Kovieit Agreement, 'but Mr . Iiearn hoped that since only two Companies were interested in this the clause would not 'become widely known* Mr. Starling said that H.M.G* were at present negotiating with various foreign countries and trying to get them to agree that they should impose no conditions on British Oil Companies which were not imposed on other Oil Companies. Having in mind these negotiations he felt inclined to agree generally with what Mr.Agnsw had said. Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty were somewhat perturbed at the very small number of refineries in British territory in view of the difficulties whicn might arise in time of war in obtaining oil for the Navy from neutral countries. The Admiralty particularly desired that there should be more refineries in British territory in Asia. He said that it was a well established British policy to ensure if possible that oil should be refined in British territory and he- suggested, and Mr. Starling agreed that this policy was well known abroad. Sir Lo uis Kershaw also doubted whether the omission of a refining clause from the present agreement would really make it much easier for British Companies vis—a—vis, for example, South ^merican iiepiiDlics juo might produce earlier documents yjhich con tanned conditions regarding refining. There was, for example, the/the standing example of Trinidad where not less than 5Qfj of the oil had to be refined locally, Mr, Agnew , however, thought that a modern Agreement made in London might have greatvaight, and he mentioned that British Companies were coming up against this difficulty more and more in their relations with foreign countries. They would rather give H .M .G. their safeguard in some other way than in a foimal public document, Mr , Seal said that the Admiralty felt that in Qatar they might go rather further in insisting on their refining desiderata than in Koweit though, of course, they would not press the Company beyond reason. Mr. Agnew suggested as a possible solution that the I.P.O. might be a sired to give H.M,G. a letter saying that the Company would be prepared at all times to discuss with H.M.G, the question of refining and that H.M,G, would have the right as soon as production in Qatar reached an amount sufficient to justify a modern refining unit to a si-: the Company to erect a refinery. lie explained that this would mean the erection of a refinery when production reached say tons a day or 700,000 tons a year. They would expect H.M.G. to treat them reasonably in regard do vhis obligation if it proved impossible to ilnd a martab for the oil. At all costs he wished to avoid the appearance of a refining clause in a formal Agreement, Sir Louis Kershaw asked whether this letter woula be obtained before the Government Agreement was signed. Mr. Agnew said he thought it would bo best that the letter should be sent say a month after the signature of the Government Agreement but that a guarantee might be obtained before signature of the Agreement that such a letter would/8. would be forthcoming. He could not of course commit the I.P.C. to tnis proposal at the present meeting and Hr. Seal added uhau neither could he cornmit the Admiralty, but iit. was agreed thac the proposal should be consi dered further by the Admiralty and by the Companies and that the Companies should prepare a draft of a letter such as had been mentioned. Mr. Agnew said that in the event of this proposal being accepted by both parties he would put it informally to the American and French representatives of the I, jr ,G. in London without ho y» ever prejudicing in his conversation with them the terms of the Government Agreement.J.Z. 1933/1934, S 1766/279/91. -U4' 'OREIQN OFFIQ1, o. . .1. 21st March 1934« Iviy dear Giloert, xou will remember my telling you this morning that I was a little uneasy on one point in connexion with the Question of the Q,atar boundariesj i.e. lest we should have weakened our position with Ibn Saud in re ;ard to the 'blue line by our failure to give him copies of the Anglo Turkish Conventions oi 1913 and 1914 establishing that line, when, in 1927, he asked us (see Sir G. Clayton's report of June 8th 1927, of which we sent you a copy in our letter No .S 2585/119/91 of July 7 1927) for 'copies of all existing treaties and agreements between His majesty's Government and the various rulers and chiefs in Arabia and on the Persian Gulf'. 2o It had occurred to me that Ion Saud might well contend that his object in asking us for these documents was in order to know exactly how he stood with regard to our claims and position generally in Arabia, and that the fact that we did not co.mnunicate to him the treaty instruments laying down the blue line left him iree to ignore that line if he wished to. He could probably argue that he had no knowledge of the Anglo Turkish Conventions or at any rate of the ratification of the 1914 Convention, and oiiac do nobody appeared to have established any efxective clciim t- the hinterland of 4atar to the east of cue olue Hj - hj , lie v ,ao perfectly free in the aosence of any warning to the contrary from us or from the Sheikh of Qatar to establish Akhwan Colonies there and generally bring this area unaex nib authority if he wished to do so. j have now referred the point to malkin and am glad to say that he does not tafce this risk very seriously. In his view, when Ion Saud asked for 'copies of all existing treaties/ UPfMAITE, ESQ,. , J ' u I f ■ HI i 1 Hf ' !l M .

But Malkin thinks that we should be protected by a still further consideration, ibn Saud's object in askin. these x v-,a£j presumably to ascertain what were the relations »»».„ th „. rul . r , „ d ^ ^ to ascertain wlmt were tiie bonnaaries setwesn ttsir territories and the former Ottoman -■? ^ 0 ^oman Empire since these v/ouxo. not nave been lei d rin^m nm •+- , . ~ .una down m treaties between Kis Majesty's Government and the nnr-r- nr. „ luJ - e i^ m question. Mallcin thinks in nact ths^t the tPT^Q -f* ti -i- o c i -'- on baud's request would nave been inconsistent with any idea that he was asking for imorrnation as to the boundaries between the former Ottoman Empire and the territories of the Arab rulers; so that the short answer to any question as to why we did ^ not communicate the two Anglo Turkish Conventions to him woula be simply that he had not asked for them. In any case, 01 course, the non communication of these treaties to Ibn Saud cannot aiiect the question of the legal validity of the blue line.

I appreciated when I sent my telegram No:477 dated the 3rd u!ay 1934 to the Air Officer Commanding, that it was important that the reconnaissance should take place quickly after the communication to Bin Sa f ud. But I did not know that a communication had already 'been made on the 28th April (though the second paragraph of Sir Andrew I^an f s telegram No:71 dated the 2bth April, a copy of which was received on the 30th April , showea that he contemplated an early commun ication). Local action was taken immediately on the receipt of the orders contained in your telegram No:450 dated the v 2nd May 1934 (indeed, the telegram came about 20.30 hours ih the evening and the launch left next morning for ^itar at 09.00 hoursj, and I trust that all will go well. 3. But I venture to hope that you will feel able to urge upon His Majesty f s Government that, should any such matter arise in the future, it would be of great help, and possibly prevent untoward consequences, if local Officers could be given the opportunity to make their preparations before a communication like that to the Sa^di Arab Government is delivered.

As soon as the plane landed at Doha,Husain an-Ni * mail / the Mudir of the Customs came in^ small jo^-lyboat and informed the P.A, that the Shaikh was out in the country and that as soon as the man-of-war was sighted he sent word to the Shaikh and informed him of the arrival of P.A.(he expected that he was op 'board the ship 'but was told that the P.A. will arrive by air). At about 3 p.m. Shaikh Hamad bin ♦Abdullah came on board H.M.S.Shoreham and informed the P.A. that his father was not well and that he sent him with a letter in % which he asked to be excused for being unable to come. In his letter the Shaikh said that he was sicK and asked to be excused. He added that should there be anything which they want to discuss it can be talked over with his son Hamad as j his deputy. After having delivered the letter Hamad bin T •Abdullah asked the P.A, if he liked to go out and see his father in the interior, and after spending the night there to return the next morning. As the Captain of H.M.S.Bideford had to be on board the ship at night he was told that it wuuld be better if they went and returned after the evening meal. He first Mcepted the arrangement but then said that he thought it better if they went in the morning as the road was fead and it would be difficult to travel at night. This arrangement was suitable to all and it was decided that the P »A, and the ofliceni should land at 6 a.m. when tne cars will be ready for 'them. On Thursday morning the IQth IHa y 1934. At 6 a.m. the P.A. accompanied by the Captain of H.M.S, Bideford and the Group Captain landed at Dohah and after sitting few minutes in the Shaikhs Palace(at Doha), where Hamad was waiting for them, they motoreo. to tlie camp oj . the Shaikh at Um-al-^uhai b.-2. Xo i 1 P.A. Shaikh The Shaikh received the P.A, e,nd the other tv/o Officers at about 20 yards from the tent( which appears to have been specially pitched for the occasion ) The tent was all carpeted and the visitors had to take their seats on the ground as no chairs were available. After coffee and tea were served the following conversation took place between the P.a, and the Shaikh:- 'I have a message from the Government which I have been instiucted to convey to you and for which reason I have come ' Ait-er the Shaikh ca±led his sons *Ali and -^amad to come near him and hear the message the P.A, informed the Shaikh verbally of the above message. 'Tms A quite all right and I have fully understood what you have said but can you tell me upto what place or for how many miles does this line extendto the south as I do not know the degree'. P.A, 'Here X Shaikh ^ P.A, Shaikh P.A. Shaikh P.A.

No one can interfere with his authority and more specially now after he had conquered Yaman. Before he conquered Yaman the people were not so much afraid of him and they expected that by fighting against Yaman he will be weak but on the contrary he has become very strong. However, supposing the geologists of the American Company (whom I do not want to come near my territory) enter this zone for survey and if I inform the Government about them will they prevent them'? 'Certainly,they will. If you will inform me I will report the matter to the Government'. 'This^all right but in order to be on the safe side and to have some authority with me for doing so, it would be better if I can nave this in writing5^ 'If you send a man with me to the ship I will send you a letter to this effect. Are there any Ikhwan settlements at Sakak and Ambak the places which you mentioned to us and what is the number of people living in each of themV 'There are two small Ikhwan settlements^ namely Sakak and Ambak. These are inhabited by persons from the nomad tribes who, live til them during the summer and leave at the winter in search for grazing lands.

AITGORA. 11th April, 1934. fv (J.- I Sir, ■ I have the honour to inform you that on the 2nd April I spoke to the United States Ambassador in the sense of the instructions contained in your despatch No. 125 of the 22nd March (E.1839 /1206/91), relative to the Anglo- Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 regarding boundaries in Eastern Arabia. Mr. Skinner was most grateful for the communication which you had authorized me to make to him. He tola me that he had been unable to obtain a copy of the unratified Convention of 1913 from the Turkish Govern ment, who had searched their archives for it in vein, and said that His Majesty's Government should realize •that matters of private interest, not of State interest- we re behind the inquiries which his Embassy had under- voQirtine in the concession of an taken, the interest residing m important Petroleum Company. 2&gt; it was obvious that my colleague knew nothing about the geography of the region in question. I emphasized the point that what X was showing him was the south eastern frontier line of Turkish Arabia. His Excellency put nc question about what was happening east of that line, so I did not refer to El Qatar. He/ The Eight Honourable K.C.V.O., Sir John Simon, Q i c - S *h' etc., etc., e-cc..He did enquire why the Ottoman Government had not ratified the 1913 Convention, and on this point I was unable to enlighten him. I said, however, that as the 1914 Convention confirmed the frontier in question, and indeed also prolonged it further southwards to the previously delimited frontier between the Aden Protec torate and the Vilayet of the Yemen, and as that Conven tion had been ratified, the non-ratification of the earlier Convention was hardly relevant to the matter in hand. 3. I handed to Mr. Skinner, for retention, the copy of the 1913 Convention enclosed in your despatch, and lent him volume XI of Aitcheson's 'Treaties', a further copy of which he said he would purchase for the use of his Embassy. 4 # I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Representatives at Washington and Jedda.

They eare also toreport if they hear of the American geologists coming across the line 'by mistake, Shaikh 1 Abdu^llah'said hat there were no Amirs or resident representatives of Bin Sa^d at Sakak or Mbak. He was also doubtful of thee xtent to which zakah was taken in our sphere,but said that all the trioes who wintered in the Hasa arest naturally paid zakah for the 'aman' of 3.S,, apparently for both the Hasa area anci else where• The men are to start in a couple of days or so. 185,34Re copy of the Bahrain Oil Conceasioiu Mr ♦Uarajyan, tlie Head Clerk of tiie Adviser, says that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad asked him for the copy of tne concession which he gave him on Thursday the 17th May 1934 # Submitted for information,please # 19.5.34P.A.

In the light of the legal opinion referred to above, and of the considerations advanced in Ryan's telegrams, we now therefore definitely incline to the view that the balance of advantage is against maintaining an indeterminate area, or 'no man's land', ana in favour of our taking our stand at once on the 'blue line' not only as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia but also as the dividing line between that kingdom and the territories of south-eastern Arabia coming within our sphere# We are confirmed in this view by the request of the United States Embassy at Angora for copies ol the 1913 and 1914 Gonventions, and by other signs ol increasing American interest in this area, e.g. the recently proposed visit of the United States Minister at Bagdad iio Riyadh, and the various indications of an active interest in oil possibilities on the part of the Standard Oil of California• 6« But if on further consideration it is now decided to abandon any attempt to maintain an indeterminate ar«a, that does not mean that we should necessarily favour any extension of any oil concession granted in respect of Qatar or of any guarantee of protection given by His Majesty's Government to the Sheikh of Qatar heyond a line running south of a line drawn across the base of the peninsula.
