Successful interception worJc depends on (l) secrecy, (^) speed and (3) manual dexterity# To assure success, censorship officers should be selected for intelligence, skill and discretion. a. As a general rule, the police are only required to act in co-operation with the postal authorities in two kinds of % interception • (a) general interception and confiscation at selected post offices of articles prohibited from entry into India under the Sea Customs Act (Section 2b P.O. Act) and (b) interception of postal articles not including money orders, with the specilie sanction of the Local Government. (Sec.26, P.O. Act). 5. In respect of interceptions under Uec. 2t&gt; of the Post Off ice Act, rule 221 of the current Indian Post Office rules requires postmasters to forward all such intercepted matter which is reasonably believed to fall within the scope of Sec.19 of the Sea Customs Act, to the Director, Intelligence Bureau, out ordinarily, the most appropriate channel for these commun ications is through the local special Branch or C.I.D. as that office is generally in a postion at once to determine whether any intercepted article has been correctly withheld. In addition to this the local Special Branches or C.I.D.'s and their officers are the most suitable advisers to Postmasters as to what postal articles the postal officials may reasonably believe to contain prohibited matter. In all cases of doubt as to whether certain imported foreign literature has been correctly withheld u/s 26 of /of the P.O. Act, a reference should be made to the Director, Intelligence Bureau.s 4. A b regards interceptions under Sec.26(1) of the P.O. Act, ordinarily the contents of letters opened should be copied and sent by the District Superintendent of Police concerned to the local Special Branch or C.I.D. on a pre scribed form and the letters passed on for delivery. In cases, however, where the letters contain purely private and unimportant material, a brief gist of the contents can be given on the prescribed form. The Special Branch or G.I.D# in giving information derived from such interceptions, use their discretion as to whether a copy of the letter should be given or whether the information should be given in such a form as not to indicate whether any letter has been seen. 5. The value of photography in important cases cannot be too strongly stressed. Photographic copies of letters whcih, for various reasons, have to be passed on but of which facsimiles are necessary, should wherever possible, be made. This important work requires both skill and secrecy. The ideal is for each Special Branch to have its own photographic section but where financial or other consider ations preclude this, the greatest care should be exercised in the selection of the outside photographer. 6. It is axiomatic tnat without the cordial cooperation of Postal Officials, censorship cannot successfully be undertaken and it is of vital importance that the goodwill of Postmasters be obtained. It should, however, be borne in mind that in normal circumstances and subject to the special powers of the District -Magistrate under the Special Powers /Powers Acts at present in force in certain provinces, it is the postal authorities and not the police who effect censor ship u/s 25 and 27-B of the P.O. Act. The function of the police officers, present in sorting offices in connec tion wi th interceptions under these two sections of the Act, is confined to the giving of advice and information and it is important that these functions should not 'be exceeded. The case is, however, as a general rule, different when interceptions under the orders of the Local Government u/s 26(1) of the P.O. Act are being made for such orders generally empower the police themselves to undertake the censorship. 7. The need for secrecy in interception cannot be too strongly stressed and in order to maintain this, the fact that censorhsip is being undertaken should be icnown to the smallest number of persons possible and only to those directly concerned. The Police Officer concerned should take postmasters into his confidence in this matter and impress upon them the need for safe-guarding the secrecy of the interception. (ieorecy being the first requisite, it is not always possible for cen sorship to be undertaken at the post office itself but to obviate delay the place of censorship must be within very easy reach of the post office concerned. iivery case of censorship, therefore, must be treated separately and the selection of the place where the actual work of censorship takes place decided in the light of local conditions. Ho hard and fast rule can be laid down. In rare instances, to maintain secrecy, arrangements can be made to take the letters to be censored, from the postal peon when on his rounds. I 3. It is desirable that, wherever possible, letters should be delivered by the postmaster to the censorship officer before the delivery mark has been stamped on them for once the mark of /m i ^ctuods of opening 4. -• j . t and tiiae of the delivery has been staiaped on letters they have to be dealt with with extreiae speed to preserve the secrecy of interception. There is a second reason for the desirability of this, which will be dealt with later on. In cases where delay occurs in the onward ti a;ijiui33ion oi letters which have been stamped, smudging o* the postal seals is a possible method of concealment. 9. It Is obvious that censorship once imposed should be carried out with the t^atest regularity so that nothing es capes interception. To ensure this, the censorship officer v . muat attend the post office punctually and regularly to colled' correspondence to bo examined. Where poasibxe, letters -;aould never remain in the hands of conaorship officers beyond the time of the next delivery of the mail by tne poot off id# conoerned. failure in this reupect will luad recipients o^ cenjoreci letters to realise that they have been tampered with and will break the secrecy of the interception. 10. It is not possible to lay down any hard and fast in structions for t.:e actual opening and closing of letters as conditions vary from province to province and what may oe a suitaDle method in the Punjab in the hot weather will obviously not work in Burma in the rains. Some of tne var ious methods adopted by the censorship officers are, however, 0 iven oelow and it is for provinces to adopt the methods they think the most suitable. (a) 'famine. a icettle not too full of water and with a very narrow spout und t, tiaht Xittine, iid Is required, w-id si eet to boil and the thin Jet oi' steaai issuing from the spout is applied to the guaimed flaps of the cover only which a are then eased rery gantly with a thin bladed jaiife, safety razor blade or thin steel Jcnitting needle. (b) / \ fi£ &amp; • ( 0 ) X&gt;ainpinR « Clean ooia water is applied sparingly to tiie gmmned flaps of the cover by means of a camel hair brush and allowed to remain until the flaps can be eased off as outlined in (a) above. In place of the direct application of water the applic ation of damp blotting paper is also a useful and rapid method of moistening the gum on envelopes. ( 0 ) Hoiling . A thin but strong steel knitting needle is inserted under the edge of one of the flaps at the corner of the envelope and then carefully rolled towards the apex of the flap separating the flap from the side leaf. The process is then repeated with the corresponding edge of the other flap of the envelope. The result is that one of the side leaves of the envelope is separated from the two main flaps. The side leaf can then be pulled out and the contents of the cover removed. If this method, which is quite quick, is used with sufficient care it is frequently possible to avoid breaking the seal on an envelope. (d) Material required. One piece of ciiean malmal or Muslin One dnob^s iron, preferably electric. One thin, but strong, knitting needle. Me thod Put the envelope under a piece of clean muslin; damp the gummed flap of the envelope with clean cold water through the muslin; press the envelope very gently with a hot dhobi's iron; pick up the envelope and insert a thin, but strong, icnitting needle under the edge of one flap; roll the needle very gently and carefully towards the centre of the flap; repeat the process with the knitting needle from the other edge 01 tne flap. It should then be possible to raise the flap. Jaution. The Operator's hands must be very clean.Method3 of closing Gene a \ No force must be uaed. 11* ihe eaaential raquiaites in reclosing letters which hare been opened for examination arej- (a) for the contents to be replaced exactly as they were found when the letter was opened. (b. for all enclosures, no matter how minute or insignif icant, {e.g. hairs or flower petaJLsjto be reinserted* (c) for very little gum or paste to be used in reclosing* ih# best adhesive is the thin gum used by the high class envelope makers, sparingly applied with a cmel h&amp;ir brush, ^ailing this , 'jripfix H or a similar photomountant is effective but the careless use of these leaves shiny patches on the envelope. 'Gloy' 1 is of little value for this work. Government issue gum should not be used as it is too thick and dirty for delicate work. (d) When an intercepted letter has been closed it should be subjected to pressure, preferably by means of a hot iron 01 failing that, by being placed between the leaves of a heavy book to eradicate creases. ( a ) opening and closing letters absolute cleanliness ol the operator's nands and of the materials and implements used is essential. (b) ieais are difiicult to reproduce and only very skilled officers can repcoduce seals with fair accuracy by taking an impression of the wax with plaster of paris in a small mould; the was seals are then broken up, melted and re-used on the original letter. (c; Jomo operators have found plasticene can be used as a ■ubstitute for plaster of paris but this method, though unaouotedly much quicker, requires a considerable degree of skill* / U) - r ! —/ i (d) Where suaail teara liave occurred in the opening of the envelope taese can oocaoionalj.y be concealed auocess- fully by the Postmaater date-atainping, hard and with a well inked a tamp, over the tear. ihia can only be done if the letter haa not been staged for delivery, (vide paragraph 8). (e) Qien recloaing covera care muat be taken to ensure the imprint of the poatal date atampa not beinc displaced when such atampa are partly on the flap and partly on the oody 01 the envelope® iispecially is auch oare neceaaary when a postage a tump haa been used to seal the flap of the envelope. (f) If a cover bears signs of having been opened already it is, as a general rule, better to Itiave it severely alone as most cases of complaints of censorship arise out of the delays and damage caused by double interception.The safest method cf cpealag letters is andcubted- iy tc employ a jet of steanuused carefully ^o avoid any running of tne writing on the eavelope, Dut this way takes time and oensors, heavily pressed, in most cases favour a steel knitting needle in the use of which with practice tney become exceedingly dextrous. A side flap of the envelope is almost invariably attacked, as slight damage to taese flaps is more easily concealed. Care must be taken throughout any operation of censorship to conceal the fact cf censorsalp. The cover should in no way De damaged; when photographing, if it is necessary to do so, the photographer must not deface or mark the document in any way e.^# oy the use cf pins or clips; if a test is made for secret inks and the wasning does not eliminate all stains, it is usually safest to withold: when closing always see that postal date stamp marks or any other marks are in their proper alignment; it is not advisable to use ctaer ^um, if sufflcfefent of the original gua still adheres, as tne presence cf two gums can De detected in a '•rays - test; if gum has to oe used, use a preparation which is not going tc proclaim censorship to the naked eye; when censored letters proceed from the censor tc tap post for local delivery ensure that they are dry Dofore they reach the addressee - the best way is tc use an electric iron, bat tnis should De done with layers of blotting paper so as not to Dura or scorch (do not press them enough to give them the immaculacy of a ^boiled 1 ' shirt or that will also invite suspicion). SealedSealed letters are difficult. In seme cases a seal cr seals can toe siloed underneath sufficiently to enable a flap tc be withdrawn, tout this method is dangerous if the operator is not practised and skilled. Indeed all sealed letters require most careful handling A method for which success can oe claimed is as followa i~ Using a paper shield tc prevent the soiling of the cover, make an impression of the seal used (plasticine on a glass slide, with a slightly damp surface rolled smoothawith a glass rod aas ^een found to be a suitaoie medium, for this purpose^. This done, the seals which Impede tne censor can tnen oe removed oy breaking into small pieces when they come away easily. After censorsnip tne same wax should ue asea to replace tae seais (to avcia aetec&amp;iou Dyia Vays 11 or any otner test), and tne seal imprint applied Dy the plasticine cast already prepared. In all censorship the time factor is one of great importance. If in some cases delay is unavoidable, a precaution is to ensure tnat postal date and time stamps are made unreadable, but any action in this direction should not De irade otovious.
