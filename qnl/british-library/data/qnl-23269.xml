As regards applications for the allotment of new frequencies, bearing in mind the urgency of each esse, there would be no objection to you approaching the authorities in I ondon direct, provided you keep us fully informed.

The Political Agency, Kuwait. The Consulate, Muscat.b® FOREIGN OFFICE S.W.I., 21st January, 1949. Dear Residency, Please refer to your letter to.136/13/48 of the 15th December about the regulations governing the allocation of frequencies in the Persian Gulf area. 2. We had put the whole matter to the General Post Office and they have produced the following notes which, we think, should cover the points raised by you:- ”Authority f o r th e operation o f re io stations . I The granting of authority for the operation of all radio stst ons within the boundaries of territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible (including the operation of foreign sponsored stations within those territories) is primarily the responsibility of the local Telecommunication Administration. In the case of the Persian Gulf are; this Administration is vested in the Political Resident, Bahrain v/hc, in consultation with the local Service Authorities (the 'riddle Fast Communica tions Board, Cairo), is responsible for the assignment of frequencies to the radio services to be operated. American sponsored stations in the Persian Gulf area, therefore, equally with British-eperated services, come under the Jurisdic tion of the Political resident and authority for their opera tion should be sought from, and granted by, him. Frequency Allocation . II Frequency allocation should be made in conformity with the provisions of the International Radio Regulations current ly ir. force. In this connection, the Political Resident may find the enclosed copy of the Final Acts of the Atlantic City Corferer.ee, of assistance. It will be seer from article 47 of those Regulations that the Atlantic City frequency alloca tion table (Article 5 of the Regulations) is already in force as far as frequencies above 27.5 k'c/s are concerned whereas for frequencies below 27.5 7c/s the frequency allocation table contained in the International uadio Regulations, Cairo, 1998, (article 7), (a copy of which was enclosed with this Department's letter of the 21st August, 1948, to the Political Resident) will not be superseded by the Atlantic City frequency avoca tion table until a date to be laid down by the special Admini strative Radio Conference which is due to be held In October next. COPY 0283/17/801) III v.e should be glad to help the Political resident, as far as we are able, ary time he may wish to have our advice or re commendations on the order of frequencies for use by services in the Persian Gulf area. In general, the use of frequencies below 65 Ic/s is liable to cause interference over long ranges and before the Political Resident authorises their use, we shou ld be glad if details of the proposed usage could be forwarded to this Department for co-ordination and clearance, where nece ssary, through the British Joint Communications card, on which both civil and military interests are represented. XV ,'In addition, for stations oper- ting on frequencies below €5 ?/c/s, i.e. those which are generally liable to cause inter ference to and experience interference from stations of other countries operating on frequencies of the same order, it is necessary to notify the use of the frequencies to the Interna tional telecommunication Union at Geneva for inclusion in the Union's international :&lt; nst of frequencies'. The enclosed sehe dufce shows the form in which particulars of radio stations are required in this connection. It is necessary for us to notify particulars of the use of frequencies below 27.5 Vc/$ /also—also to the Provisional Frequency Board, Geneva, on forir. 1 (for fixed - l.e. point-to-point - and bnoadcasting services) or form 2 (for maritime, aeronautical and land robile services), specimens of which are also enclosed. V It would perhaps be simpler if details furnished by the Political Resident for notification to the Bureau of the In ternational Telecommunication Union and the Provisional Freque ncy Board could be sent to this Department direct and if the Foreign Office have no objection perhaps the Political Resident could be advised accordingly. VI Frequencies above €5 Mc/s normally have a comparatively short range of operation and interference to or from stations of other countries using frequencies of the same order is^ therefore less likely to result from their use. In the cir cumstances it is not considered necessary either that these frequencies should be cleared through the British Joint Commu nications Board or that their use should be notified to the Bureau of the International Telecommunication Union. In such cases nevertheless, frequencies should be selected from appro priate bands under the Atlantic ^ity Regulations, according to the type of service to be performed, and should be agreed in consultation with the Middle East Communications Board; and, ^ as a matter of general information, this Department would be glad to be advised of the ultimate allocations. Record of f r equency allocation . VII It is essential that frequencies for new stations in the Persian Gulf area should be allocated so as not to cause interference to existing stations working within the Persian Gulf or elsewhere. It is accordingly recommended that a com prehensive central record of all authorised stations and ser vices in the Persian Gulf area should be kept by the Political Resident. Ai;? ocation of call signs . VIII For stations liable to cause international interference i.e. those which operate on frequencies below 65 »c/s, call signs should be allocated in accordance with the provisions of Article 19 of the Atlantic City Radio Regulations. As there is no international call sign block allocated to the Per sian Gulf area, a group of call signs from the United Kingdom international series will be allocated by this Department on receipt of information as to the number of such groups likely 'to be required. (The block of call signs M.P.4, followed by a group of not more than three letters, has already been re served for allocation by the Political Resident at his discre tion to amateur stations in the Persian Gulf area). It is not essential that call signs from the international series should be allocated to stations which are not likely to cause interna tional interference, i.e. stations operating on frequencies of over 65 Mc/s; in these cases, the Political resident is at liberty either to use call signs from the M.P.4 - series or to allocate whatever alternative call signs he sees fit. 3. With rerard to the action proposed by the General Post office in paragraph V, we think it would be best if you sent the required information through us. 4. hope If this does not give you all the answers you want, you will w ite again. we Yours ever, GENERAL DEPARTMENT The Residency, Bahrain..0 CO^n? rr, ^ C/%h35.
