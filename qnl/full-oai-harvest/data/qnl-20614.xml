Kemball writes that the Bahrain ruler Shaikh Mohamed ben Khuleefa [Muḥammad bin Khalīfah] remains unprepared to raise the blockade, but that he has taken the step of opening negotiations with Fayṣal ibn Turki. Kemball also writes of the annual tribute that Muḥammad bin Khalīfah would be prepared to pay his rivals at Dammām, if they were to quit that place (6,000 crowns) or to remove themselves from Wahhābī territory completely (10,000 crowns).The following enclosures are included with Kemball’s letter:1. The translation of a letter (folios 124-25) from Faisal bin Turki to Kemball, dated 29 September 1854;2. The translation of a letter (folios 126-27) from Kemball to Fayṣal ibn Turki, dated 19 October 1854. Kemball’s letter encloses a letter (folio 128) addressed to Turki bin Faisal from Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah to Fayṣal ibn Turki, dated 20 October 1854. Kemball states that the letter is a move toward reconciliation, and repeats his request that Fayṣal ibn Turki order the withdrawal of the sons of the late ‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmed Āl Khalīfah from Dammām, as well as order them to stop their hostilities against Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000016#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
