Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter of the 12th Novemher, 1934, concerning the local allowance of His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, I am directed hy Viscount Halifex to state, for the information of the Marquess of Zetland, that he has had under consideration the proposal to increase this local allowance to £300 a year in the case of a married incumbent of the post, while maintaining the existing local allowance of £200 a year in the case of an unmarried officer. 2. Since 1934 the number of British employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Ahwaz has considerably increased and there has been a consequent rise in the general standard of living. 3. The post is the busiest in Iran and Mr. Gardener has personally to deal with as many as two hundred confidential letters a year. In order that the efficient working of the post should be maintained, Lord Halifax feels that Mr. Gardener should be as far as possible relieved from financial anxieties. In particular, it is essential on grounds of health that he should be able to send his wife to this country for a part of the summer. As Lord Zetland is aware, the journey to and from Ahwaz is both difficult and expensive. 4. The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.4 Under these circumstances the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury have 'been asked for the increase of local allowance indicated in paragraph 1 above, on the understanding that the Government of India will concur in the proposal and authorise a moiety of the cost involved, and I am to express the hope that, in the event of sanction being obtained the increased expenditure, Lord Zetland may be agreeable to a moiety thereof being borne by the Government of India.

Customs compensatory allowances were granted to Consular officers serving at Foreign Office posts in Persia with effect from 1st April 1934, and the Government of India accepted a moiety of the expenditure involved as a charge on Indian Revenues. The grant was subject to review on or before 1st April 1936. A recent enquiry elicited the fact that the Foreign Office approached the Treasury in September 1936 and obtained their consent to the extension of the grant to 1st April 1938, but that by an oversight no communication was made to this Office on the subject. 2. As it happens there could have been no question of refusing to agree to the extension since the high customs dues imposed by the Persian Government which necessitated the grant of compensatory allowances have been continued and in some cases have increased. Copies of correspondence have been received which shows in fact that the Government of India are examining proposals for a 100% increase in the similar allowances granted to their officers in the Persian Gulf and Jast Iran, tbut the formal agreement of the Government of India should have been obtained to the Foreign Office proposals. 3.

The Government of India tiave examined your proposals for incrense in the customs compensatory allowances of officers and establishments serving in Iran ana the Persian Gulf and desire to observe as follows i- It has been stated Uiat all the commodities, mentioned in statement 'A' attached to your letter No. 1556/36-89-111, dated the 23rd July 1936 which la the basis of your proposals, have to be imported, since none of them is produced In Iran, and that even excluding wines, spirits arh tobacco which are very highly taxed, the percentage increase is 415. This, however, uoes not give a correct picture, as the extra cost which the officers and establishments have to incur as a result of the enhancement of duties, will depend not only on tne increased duties but also on the amounts of the several commodities consumed by them in a month. Hie members of the establishments all draw pay less than mi 300/- a month ana they can scarcely he expecwa to /purchase \-/ V . - hot; Mfe - - oT M jliHw t Jk/ oflS »'J ^aoaoic tawoLLa H» tUHj iwfoXK: I moiJti&amp;s; to ais^a ';c i (Sen-r- yieq a/U svig &lt;rot» ai»atlX&lt;- e etU 3» 13«i fttltfv' '*» 4 XatiViM \00^ •«nr' 3. In tube cose of Gazetted Officers also, uie position will not oe very different even taking Into account wines ana spirits. TaKiug Uie case of due Vice-Consul, Khor raashahr , as an Illustration to explain the position, It is observea from the statements attached to the Vice-Consul's letter No. 4/4/539, dated the 2nd May 1936, that the difference between the total Iranian and Indian charges on wines and spirits is about Rs. 2,100/- and on other commodities about As. 600/-. On the basis of this standard which is that of an officer who lias to do entertaining on a large scale, about r«s. 600/- or even less out of the customs compensatory allowance of hs. 1,200/- per annum drawn by an officer who has not to do much of entertaining, would represent the compensation on account of ttie heavy duty on commodities other than wines ann the /uuA^u*ce............... purchase imported articles like super-fine flour, butter, eardinee, pickles, chocolate, oranges, etc., except probably on occasions. Their purchase of importea tobacco and Klxg cigarettes ana cloth must, also In view of the prohibitive duty, be very limited and It is obvious that they will have to be content with whatever stuff of this and other coramoultles is offeree by Iran Itself. As regards the dally necessities like Flour, Tea, nugar, coffee raid Goap, assuming that superfine flour is used, the percentage Increase is no doubt 201, but if the actual requirements of each commodity in a month are taken into account, the Government of India consider that the extra expenditure on account m. the increased duties will not be very great, and that a cent per cent increase in the customs compensatory allowance proposed by you will not be justified.3 balance o£ about.

In regard to the Passport Clerk referred to in your letter No. 1937/64/151-A, dated the 22nd September 1936, it Is observed that no allowance was allowances were granted to all officers serving In Iran and the Persian Gulf and this was evidently Xor the reason that in 1923, when due to the Inadequacy of the 4.

Memorandu m No. 1909|636-E . dated the 9th July 1923, and ~ to submit a copy of letter No. 1092, dated the 2hth August 1936 from the Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr, in which he requests that the Passport Clerk at Khorramshahr may be granted Customs Compensatory Allowance at the rate admissible to Upper Division clerks of the Persian Gulf Residency serving in Iran. 2. There is no question that the cost of living in Iran has vastly increased or that it bears very heavily on all who serve in Iran. I would only refer, in support of this view, to the recommendations contained in Colonel Fowle’s letter No. 1 556, date d the 23rd July 1936^ proposing an increase in the rates of'TJushims Compensatory allowances of officers and establishments serving in Iran. 3. Although the post of Passport Clerk is not borne on the regular cadre of the establishment of the Persian Gulf Residency, he is affected to the same extent by the rise in the cost of living, indeed more so in a sense as he has no pensionary prospects. 4. I, therefore, recommend that the Passport Clerk of the Khorramshahr, Vice-Consulate should be granted Customs Compensatory Allowance at the rate admissible from time to time in the case of the Upper Division clerks of the regular establishment. 5. The extra expenditure involved in the proposal during the current year can be met from anticipated savings in the current year’s budget of the Persian Gulf Residency. Copy of letter from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr, No. 1092, fated the 29th August 1936. I have the honour to refer to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Memorandum No. 1909|636-E, of 9th July 1923 f to the address of the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, fixing the pay of the passport clerk of this Vice-Consulate at Rs. 200. 2. The passport clerk’s pay was fixed with due regard to the cost of living then prevailing in Mohammerah. Since 1930 the cost of living has increased considerably. The new Customs tariffs, road, Municipal and Bandarol taxes and stamp duties have doubled the price of imported goods. The new system of collecting revenue by means of octroi duties on the primary food stuffs on arrival at the market have increased the price of flour, eggs, meat, etcetera. 3. Mr. Habibullah’s appointment is non-pensionable and with the high cost of living now prevailing, he finds it almost impossible to save against his retirement. 4. I would request that he be given Compensation Allowance on the same scale as Upper Division Clerks, i.e., Rs. 25 or such sum as that allowance may be increased to, in order to compensate him for the increase in both import and local taxes.

It will be seen from this Residency's letter No. 762 dated the 30th March 1929, that a higher rate of allowance was recommended for the Secretary to the Poli tical Resident than for the under Secretary and the resi dency burgeon, Bushire, but the Government of India sanc tioned a uniform rate of Es 100/- per mensem for each of these officers. The Secretary to the Political Resident, who enjoys consular status, is required to entertain on a larger scale than either of the above-named officers, especially as he represents the Political Resident when the latter is absent from the station. 1, therefore, recommend that his allowance should be increased to Is 250/ per mensem. 9. The considerations justifying a special increase in the case of the Assistant Registrar, Bushire, to bring his allowance into line with those of the other gazetted officers, namely, the Registrar and Treasury Officer, the Confidential Assistant and the Assistant Surgeon, are stated in my letter Ho. 1572 dated the 23rd July 1936.10.

It was reconimended that he should be given a Rep resentation Allowance of one thousand pounds per year. Owing to the proximity of Abadan, to the presence of the Iranian Navy and to visits of His Majesty’s Navy, av try considerable portion of the entertainment falls on the holder of the post at Khorramshahr whatever nis rank may be and it is absolutely necessary that he should be in a position to maintain the standard as described by Captain Bgzelgette* 3* My own experience of the mentality and requirements of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company is similar to that of Captain Bazalgette and of Captain Chauncy, It was for such reasons that I found it necessary to request a local allowance of four huncred^ pounds for iqyself, which the Foreign Office first reduced to three hundred and then acquiesced in a further reduction to two hundred by the T r easury on the grounds that I was already drawing a high scale of Customs Compensation Allowance. 4, The total nett allowances requested by Captain Bazalgette amount to Rupees five hundred and fifty per month, equivalent to four hundred and ninety five pounds per year* My own allowances, including representation, customs compensationand local allowance amount to five hundred and sixty pounds per year plus cost-of-living bonus and I consider that at least an approximately equal sum is required for Khorramshahr. 5« I shall be glad if you can see your way to supporting these applications.

C, WALim, &lt;23&gt; /y. t 'v* // ^ -A- / r ^ My dear Cleary, On looking at our letter to the Treasury of the 3rd October regarding the proposed local allowance for His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, I find that we have referred to the special allowance in respect of excessive customs duties as having heen assigned to the consul at Ahwaz in common with other officers in Persia. This is hardly correct, as I believe that the Government of India have not yet signified their willingness to contribute half of the cost involved. Perhaps when you write to India about the question of the local allowance, you might explain that our sentence on this point needs correction. I should like to say, though, that we have good reason to assume that India will not refuse to contribute, as we accepted half the cost of similar allowances to Indian officers in Persia as long ago as 1931. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. (K 12118/2711/234) 19 3 4 There/There is another small point in the same letter. We spoke of the average summer temperature being 125 degrees in the shade at Ahwaz. Prom what I have heard since, I think this figure is rather on the high side and I fancy that something like 115 is nearer the correct figure, though last summer I believe the thermometer actually went up to 129 in the shade. If you think it worth while, you might perhaps also mention that when you write to India. Yours sincerely•^1 Register No. P.z. 7011/34 POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.

Sir, I am directed oy Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit herewith, to he laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty 1 s Treasury, copy of correspondence with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in which it is proposed that His Majesty’s Consul at A hwaz should he granted a local allowance at the rate of £300 per annum. I am to state that in the course of a recent interviev/ with a member of this Department, Mr. Consul Watkinson, the present incumbent of the post, satisfied this Department that the usual requirements for the grant of local allowance are clearly fulfilled at Ahwaz on the following grounds!— (a) The surrounding country is desert, producing none oi the necessities of life. Persian produce is available xor four months each year at- the most, and then only when roads from the interior are free of snow in the mountain passes. During the summer the excessive heat does not allow of the transport of perishable food stuffs. There are no local shops from which European supplies can be ootained. His iiajesty’s Consul cannot avail himself of the facilities which exist for the purchase of such supplies oy employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from the company s canteen, since, under the terms of the oil concession, these are for the sole use of the Company’s The Secretary to the Treasury. employees/employees and not to be disposed of elsewhere. He must therefore import the bulk of his requirements and, apart from excessive customs duties in respect of v/hich a y'' special allowance has been assigned to him in common with other officers in Persia, the cost of preserved supplies is naturally high. In addition, it has been ascertained zt. that His Majesty*s Consul expends approximately only £200 a year in local currency upon goods obtainable locally. He is thus able to profit only to a very limited extent from the advantages v/hich, elsewhere in Persia, are derived from the local purchase of commodities at a favourable rate of exchange. (b) The local standard of living for Europeans is high, as the colony is composed almost entirely of Anglo— Persian Oil Company officials who enjoy high rates of remuneration. It is, moreover, essential that the Consul should maintain close relations with these officials if he is to perform his duties adequately, since they are often in the position to furnish him with important information v/hich he could not obtain from other sources. (c) The climate is extremely bad, the average summer temperature being 125 degrees in the shade, and the average winter temperature about 80 degrees, with, however, sudden cold periods of northerly wind and frost. These extremes necessitate a large supply of clothing, v/hich is speedily ruined by primitive local methods of cleansing. During the summer, ice must be obtained in large quantities, while medical stores are required continually to maintain health. The climate does not permit English women and chidren to live at Ahwaz for more than three months each year, thus necessitating/necessitating the expense of maintaining a separate estaolishment in this country and of additional travelling, expenses. The officials of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company invariably follow this course. (d) Local conveyances are used only by Arabs and are infested with vermin. A private motor car is, therefore essential, and although provision exists for the payment of running expenses of the Consul’s car from office allowance, this by no means compensates the Officer for the rapid deterioration of his car through the absence of properly surfaced roads. Replacement of cars becomes frequently necessary. 2. Sir John Simon considers that on the grounds stated above it would be equitable for the Officer in charge at Ahwaz to receive an allowance on the same scale as that already sanctioned for His Majesty’s Consuls at Bagdad and Mosul, namely, £400 a year. Since, however, the local allowance payable to Officers in Iraq is inclusive of cost of living bonus, it is considered that an allowance of £300 per annum would meet the case for Ahwaz. ^ a,iil accordingly to express the strong hope that Their Lordships may he moved to sanction this proposal, provided that one half of the expenditure involved is home hy the Government of India, with effect from a date in the near future when His Majesty's Consul vail reach Ahwaz on return from leave of absence.

Sir, I have had under consideration the question of the grant of a local allowance to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, in view of the special conditions obtaining at that post. These are, I take it, the climate, which apart from questions of health, involves the purchase of large quantities of clothing and also of medical stores; the scarcity of local supplies, necessitating the extensive importation of stores with resultant loss of the benefit of a favourable exchange; the high standard of living, and the fact that Ahwaz is, for the greater part of the year, unsuitable for women and children, so that a married Consular officer is under the necessity of maintaining a separate establishment elsewhere. 2. The amount of the local allowance to be granted to His Majesty’s Consul has been estimated at £300 per annum but, before maxing application to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, I should be glad to learn whether, in your opinion, there are any additional circumstances which should be taken into consideration. At the same time I may add that, should 'the allowance for His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz be granted, this fact could not be taken as warranting similar grants elsewhere in Persia.

Sir, I have the honour to make the following ohservations on your despatch No. 353 (K 6442/2711/234) of July 17th, on the subject of a local allowance for His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz. 2. In regard to the high standard of living in Khuzistan, of which full details were given in iay despatch No. 60 of February 5th last, I would mention that while the staff of the Anglo-persian Oil Company, with whom His Majesty's Consul comes much in contact, have facilities for obtaining imported goods and stores at specially favourable rates, partly by the terms of the Company's concession and partly owing to the fact that a large organisation such as the Anglo-Persian oil Company can economise by buying at wholesale prices for its staff. His Majesty's Consul is obliged to buy in the ordinary retail market and must import through the ordinary channels and, consequently, pay the ordinary and exorbitant customs dues and other imposts. 3. I venture, also, to mention one other point which seems to merit particular consideration in the case of the Consular officer at Ahwaz. This is the fact that his subordinate Vice-Consul at Mohammerah, an Officer of the Indian Political Department, receives no less than five hundred pounds a year more than his superintending consul who is senior to him The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I. , etc, etc, etc, Foreign Office, both/^ 3 00 £300 both in age and rank. The Mohaumierah post is, of course, even more expensive than Ahwaz owing to the great amount of entertaining required, hut the proposed local allowance of three hundred pounds for Ahwaz would, I think, remove any feeling of grievance at present existing. 4. I hope, therefore, most earnestly that the Lords Commission ers of His Majesty's Treasury will, after taking all the facts into consideration, grant a local allowance of not less than three hundred pounds to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz.

They consider that as no Consul- General of the Levant Service is at present posted in Persia it is not necessary to make any provision for a Consul-General as suggested by His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. They however agree that His Majesty’s Consul, Ahwaz, may be granted customs compensatory allowance at the rate of £110, if un-married, and £140, if married, as a special case.

I hope shortly to be in a position to address you on the subject of similar difficulties experienced by other officers of the Levant Consular service in Persia; but though Mr. Baillie's difficulties are largely due to the same causes, that is, the heavy customs and rood tax charges on all imported articles and the sudden and considerable rise in the value of the rial, they are also due to special causes arising from conditions peculiar to Bushire. For this reason I think it right to present his case in advance of the others and to ask that it may be considered without delay. 2. Mr. Baillie's general position is best illustrated by the following table of his monthly expenditure:- Servants: Head Boy 230 Cook 180 Gardener 150 Sweeper 90 Dhobi 60 /Total The Sight Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.X., etc., etc., etc.. The Foreign Office.Total for Servant# 710 Dally Bazaar 600 Conveyance 500 Light, fuel and water 260 Telephone 30 Postages 100 Library 15 Golf Club go Golf balls 40 Customs 800 Repairs and Incident als 100 Expenses: 2666 ® 76, say: Maintenance of wife and children in United Kingdom.

Representation allowance. 160. Local allowance 5Q« Bonus allowance 6 . £ 667, part of which is liable to income tax. 3# rj,he number of servants which Mr. Baillie is compelled to maintain is one of the evils imposed inexorably by local custom and all efforts on his part to reauce the number have been fruitless. The head boy attends to the bungalow generally and to his personal need but cannot go into the bazaar daily to do the shopping (th house is some miles outside of the town), nor has he the time to cook. 'Cook* is a euphonic expression for the bo who purchases and prepares the meals and, though as inefficient as the average, is indispensable. The sweepe /principa!T&gt; S/- 8 .

Rials 65Q» Rials 2b* principal Job is to attend to the primitive sanitary arrangesonts, to fetch water, sweep in and around the bungalow and to clean windows, brass-work, etcetera. The gardener's services are imposed by the landlord who would otherwise Increase the rent by the amount of his wages. A dhobi la inevitable. 4. Mr. Baillie assures me that the bazaar (that is, kitchen) bill is as low as he can make it. Even at the present rate of exchange it only works out at a little over five shillings a day. 6. The question of conveyance has always been a difficult one for the Vice-Consul at Bushire. Hr. Baillie hopes shortly to reduce this expense somewhat by acquiring a car of his own. In the meanwhile he is compelled to hire decrepit taxis at exorbitant rates. The monthly sum quoted includes a certain amount of official transport not covered by his office allowance. Thus the journey from his bungalow to the Consulate-General in Bushire costa ten rials a day, say three thousand one hundred and thirty rials a year, excluding Sundays, as against a yearly allowance of Rials two thousand, five hundred. This leaves a difference of six hundred and thirty rials. As Sunday visits to the office are often necessary, as well as occasional official visits to the Residency at Salsabad at twenty five rials a time and frequent journeys on business in the town, the real difference is much greater. But apart from the question of official journeys, the expenditure on transport at Bushire is inevitably very large. The Vice-Consul must take exercise and relaxation in the Interests of his health and must take his part in the social life of the colony. The Golf course and equaeh racquets court are both situated at Balsabad, seven miles from Bushire^and three or four mlleefrom the Vice-Consul’s house, while the houses of the European colony are scattered over a large area at considerable distances from each other. 6. The electricity supply is provided by the Public Works Department of the Oovernment of India at twelve annas a unit and the consumption is as heavy or heavier In summer - on account of the use of fans - as in winter. 7. The customs item represents landing and clearing charges only on imported articles, as until the last few months Mr. Baillie has enjoyed customs exemption. The period of grace has now ended and hia expenses have been greatly Increased by customs duties, which with road tax amount to over one hundred per centum of the value of some articles. Unlike posts on the Persian plateau, Bushire im a place where almost everything in the way of foodstuffs, especially fruit and Vegetables and butter, has to be imported. The drain on the pockets of those who live there is correspondingly severe. I enclose some figures Illustrative of the duties and taxes paid on imported goods in recent months by residents of Bushire. 8. You will observe that in Mr. Baillie’s budget no allowance is made for medical treatment (that is, nursing expenses or any special treatment which the Residency surgeon, cannot provide), dental treatment (as the nearest dentist is at Abadan or Karachi, the actual dentist's bill would be a mere fraction of the cost of treatment), expenditure on clothing for himself, his family and servants, servants' new year gratuities, saving in anticipation of leave, newspapers, children's education, or the subscriptions to which Consular officers are constantly exposed. Even without these necessary, and In /mostmost eases inevitable items of expenditure, Mr# Baillie’s expenses exceed his emoluments and X can well believe him when he tdls me that he is running rapidly into debt, and that he can see no way of effecting any saving while Keeping up the position expected of him. 9 . in these circumstances I consider it urgently necessary that the local allowance which is at present fifty pounds and would today be low even for a bachelor, for whom it was presumably fixed, should be raised in the case of a married man like **r. Baillie to three hundred pounds, or alternatively paid to him in the guise of a special allowance such as ia, I believe, paid at exceptionally expensive posts like Basrah, and I trust that sanction for this increase will be granted# 10# I a* sending a copy of this despatch to Mr. Baillie. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) V.A.L. Mallet.wo. soa. British Legation, Tehran. 1st November, 1933. Sir In my despatch No. 507 of today's date. I have given various reasons for granting an increase in local allowance to Mr. Balllle, His Majesty's Vice- the honour to offer certain supplementary observations upon the position of the Levant Vice-Consul at Bushire. Hie Majesty's Legation when the question of Mr. Baillie's appointment first arose that he was a married man with a family. Had this fact been realised at the outset I feel sure that representations would have been made as to the desirability of selecting an unmarried officer. Buahire is, to my mind, a post to which no officer, even a bachelor if it can be avoided, and certainly not a married man should be sent without previous experience of Persia. Of recent years the Vice-Consuls have all gone there after a spell as probationers at Tehran; this meant that they arrived there conversant with the language and with Persian conditions generally, including the restrictions upon imports which make life a burden to the foreign resident in these days, and it also meant that there was always someone in the Residency familiar with the workings of the Tehran Legation. Moreover Consul at Bushire, In the present despatch I have 2 . I do not think that it was realised by at any rate when they went there. /5. The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, O.C.S.I., c?to., etc., etc. The Foreign Office3* After Ur* Blanca's departure It was impossible to continue this arrangement for the simple reason that no probationers had been sent to Tehran for two or three years past. In the circumstances it was necessary to select an officer for the post from among those serving outside Persia and the choice fell upon Mr. Baillie. I am unaware of the exact reasons which led him to leave his family in England, but apart from anything else it would have been an act of elementary prudence on the part of any officer in his position not to bring them to Bushire until he had himself made arrangements for their reception. 4* It may be objected to this argument that many other officials live in Bushire with their wives and families without disastrous consequences • The answer to this objection is, I think, twofold. In the first place the other officers on the staff of the Residency have almost all had long experience either of Persia or of countries like India where the climate and standards and ways of life are more or less the same. In the second place these officers have very much more money to spend upon the comforts which make life in these countries tolerable. 3* This second point is one that has often been raised before, but which I make no apology for raising again in view of the glaring discrepancy which it involves. The best illustration in Mr. Baillie's case is to compare his position with that of the Under-Secretary to the Political Resident. The present incumbent of that post, who is twenty seven years old, and is still on probation (and unmarried) receives (including &gt; *» the one hundred Rupees a month paid as customs duty compensation to all /officersr £160. £ 500. officer* of the Foreign and Political Department serving in Persia) one hundred and fifty pounds a year more than itr* Baillie who, besides being his senior in the staff of the post, has twenty years service under the crown, the last eight having been spent abroad in the Consular service, and has a wife and children. In addition the Under-Secretary is provided with a furnished house (incidentally right next to the Residency office, so that he has no official transport expenses) while the Vice-Consul is paid the rent of unfurnished quarters and left to find his own furniture, which is unobtainable locally. These additional considerations seem to ae to render it more iaperative than ever to raise the Ioc&amp;j. allowance of the Vice-Consul to the figure suggested in my previous despatch. 7 * I may add in passing that in Khusiatan, Mr. Watkinson, the Consul at Ahwas, receives fivs hundred pounds a year less than his subordinate Vice-Consul at Mohammerah, a discrepancy which is more glaring still, even allowing for the fact that Mr. Watkinson is unmarried and Lieutenant Chauncy married.

Previous Papers :—f f iosr P.Z.514C/34 Minute Paper. political Department. Please see the minute on P.8332/29 below where the Government of India’s proposal to grant customs compensatory allowances to their Consular Officers and establishments in Persia and the Gulf was considered. The ground for the proposal was that the Persian tariff introduced in September, 1928, imposed a heavy additional burden on Consular Officers serving in Persia for which the Government of India considered that they should be compensated. The allowances proposed by the Government of India (which are flagged X) were sanctioned and were later improved as regards certain subordinate officials. Although the Foreign Office agreed in their letter of 6 th May, 1930, to bear half the cost of the concession, it is not until now that they propose a similar concession for their own Consular Officers serving in Persia. The reason for this long delay is not clear since it was x understood from para. 2 of the letter from the Consul- General, Khorasan, dated 23rd February, 1929, that the Foreign Office were then being asked to grant a similar concession to their Officers. A possible explanation is that Foreign Office Consular Officers are granted a cost- of-living bonus which is based on local conditions and which reflects in some measure the incidence of the customs duties. Inasmuch es Government of India Consular Officers do not enjoy this bonus, the ground for granting this concession to Foreign Office Consular Officers seems less strong than in the case of the former. But Sir R. Hoare makes out a strong case for the proposal on its merits. The F.0.proposals are set out together with the allowances paid by the Government of India in the table attached/' J- attached. it will be seen that the allowances sanctioned for officers of the Government of India conpare favourably with those proposed for the Foreign Office Consular Officers. The allowances proposed by the Foreign Office will not be payable during leave or in respect of a period of customs franchise. This corresponds to the condition under which the concession is granted to Indian Service Officers, namely that the allowance will only be granted if the Officer has not enjoyed customs exemption during any month for which the allowance is claimed. The proposals seem reasonable, and it will be observed that they are to be subject to review on or before 1st April, 1936. It is therefore submitted that we might recommend the Government of India to concur in them and to accept a moiety of the expenditure involved. Draft letter to the Government of India accordingly.

When Mr .Law approached Government by his letter Mo. 389/21/2 of 25th May 1929 he mentioned that His I&amp;je sty^s Consul General was the only Government servant who had hitherto benefitted by Customs exemption. It is for this reason that no claim for Compensation Allowance was raised on behalf of other officers and clerks. His Majesty f s Consul at Sistan has however now informed me that his junior staff have been granted the allowance with effect from 1 st September 19 31. 3. As the position of the subordinate officers and clerks of the Meshed Consulate General is identical with that of the persons of corresponding status serving in the Sistan Consulate, excepting only that the cost of living in Meshed is much higher thuti in Sistan, I have to request that the concession granted may be extended to Meshed. 4.

In my letter Eo. 244, dated the 14th April 1929, I had only recommended those officers and establishments who, prior to the withdrawal of customs concessions by the Persian Government, enjoyed the privileges of importing articles of general consumption and other necessaries of life free of customs duty, but from practical experience, it has been found that, not only those who enjoyed the privilege of importation of articles from India free of customs duty, but also those who had not this privilege before are very adversely affected by the enhanced cost of living, owing to very heavy duties on foreign goods. The increased cost bears even more heavily on those who were omitted from the scheme, since such members of the staff are in receipt of comparatively low pay and no compensation 3* In view of the fact that the (Government of India, have sanctioned in the above quoted memorandum, the grant of compensatory allowance, on the recommendation of the Bon f ble the Political Eesident in the Persian (Gulf, to all officersofficers and esta'blistiments in the Persian Gulf cadre, I venture to submit that the conditions in East Persia warrant the sympathetic consideration of Grovemment with regard to the officers and establishments of Sistan and Duzdap Consulates, who are at present not in receipt of such an allowance and therefore at a disadvantage compared with those of eauivalent status in the uulf. All imported goods are subject to heavy railway freight in addition to Persian Customs and are consequently more costly than in the u-ulf ports. I have already submitted my proposals to u-ovemment for scale of pay of establish ment of Sistan and Duzdap Consulates with a view to their being put on the same basis as establishments in the Uulf, and YiTould now request that the u-ovemment of India will give sympathetic consideration to the proposals submitted herewith In connection with the grant of compensatory allowances for customs, to all officers and establishments under Sistan and Duzdap Consulates. 4.

Please see Government of India’s letter of 12th December, below in which they recommend the grant of a compensatory allowance of varying amounts in lieu of customs exemption to the officers of establishments in recommendsd is substantially that the introduction of the new Persian Tariff has, since September 1928, imposed a i heavy additional burden on Consular officers serving in Persia, kot only were they exempt from such duties prior to the introduction of the new tariff but it is of so exorbitant a nature as to affect adversely those officers who did not enjoy any customs privileges. The case is fully aet out in the reports from the various Consuls and Consuls General enclosed in the Government of India’s letter, and it is unnecessary to enter into it in greater detail. 3, As regards the recommendations submitted by the Government of India I would only say that they appear prima facie reasonable and that it is clear that they represent the result of careful scrutiny of the local recommendations. As you will see these have been substantially modified in several cases. that we should be justified in supporting the Government of India’s recommendation. The hardship imposed particularly on junior officers serving in the Gulf has been represented unofficially on various occasions lately. On the other hand any decision will react on the position of the Levant Consuls in Persia. I understand Persia erf the Persian Gulf. The case for the concession The oircumstances are quite special and I think 3818a 5000 8/29 from( from the Foreign Office that nothing has in fact so far been done for them and it is likely therefore that we may expect difficulty, if not with the Foreign Office certainly with the Treasury* The latter may, moreover, argue that Persia is not unique in having an exorbitant tariff, that increases such as are now complained of are an ever present danger, and that action on the lines now suggested would establish a precedent which might prove very embarrassing to them later. But I think we might at any rate in the first instance give a general support to the Government of Indian proposals, and leave it to the Imperial departments to raise the difficulties. J- G.Laithwaite 14.1.30. I agree that we may support the proposals of the Government of India. The grant is related to the increasea cost of living and I would stand on this ground rather than that of increased Customs duties for I feel that the latter would be very shaky. Apparently members of the Diplomatic and Consular services already have some sort of cost of living &gt; bonus which the Treasury must have approved, and they A o-lr CP&lt;. ^ will be the less able to oppose its extension to officials in Persia and the Gulf.

As His Majesty's Government are aware trie introduction of tue new tariff since September 1923 has imposed a heavy ' adptLtional burden on tne resources of all Consular Officers serving in Persia who were hitherto exempt from such duties The new tariff is moreover so exorbitant that even theofficials who did rot enjoy any customs privileges are adversely affected. It is nearly 200 Jo above the tariff in force in 1920, and 50 ft higher than tne tariff for corresponding articles in India. The abnormal conditions thus created by the new Persian law is in the opinion of the Government of India sufficient justification for the grant of some sort of compensation to all concerned* It is understood that members of the Consular and Diplomatic services are compensated by means of the cost of living bonuses which automatically reflect tne incidence of new duties. 3. As regards the form of ana x,he extent of one financial assistance which should be given different officers mold different views. Our Consular officers under the Bushire Residency have asked for a compensation of 10 &gt; of tneir pay* The same figure is also recommended by his Majesty*s Consul for Sistan and Kain. The Political Resident in Bushire has recommended varying figures for the officers. His Majesty’s Consul General, Khorasan, has asked for an increase of a third of his sumptuary allowance. It seems difficult to fix the amount of compensation as a percentage of pay. It would be more equitable to graduate the allowances so as to take into account difference in conditions between the inland and seaside stations, and also in uhe case of the higher officers the amount of entertaining wnich nas to be done. After studying the circumstances of eacn case the Government of India consider that the requisite financial assistance should be given in the shape of compensatory allowances at the rates detailed in the statement attached. 4. The extra expenditure involved on this account anounts to Rs. 2,055/- per mensem only or Rs. 24,660/- per annum, divisible in moities between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. As regards tne date of effect, the Government of India regret that they cannot see tneir way to recommend retrospective effect and they therefore suggest that the usual practice of giving effect from the date ofof Secretary of State's orders may be followed provided the Resident can meet tnis small additional expenditure during the current year from witnin nis existing budget grants; otherwise the scneme might be given effect to from the 1st Marcn 1930 for which necessary provision has been included in the budget pending the Secretary of State's sanction. I am to request that tne Secretary of State in Council may be moved kindly to accord nis sanction at an early date which may be communicated by telegram.

From J The iion'hle Sir Frederick W. Jonnston, K.C.I.E. , C.S.I., I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter from nis Britannic Majesty^ Consul, Kerman and a note of a representa tion made to me by members of the Residency Staff. As it is most suitable that toese officers should be allowed to state tneir side of the case and at the same time probably not de sirable that this should take the form of a memorial, it seems most convenient to forward it in its present form. 2. There can be no question that the imposition of the new Persian Customs Law in September 1928 nas hit all these officer very severely and that the excessive rise in tne price of commodities in general use by European Officers nas resulted in an enhanced domestic expenditure varying from Rs. 100/- to Rs.200/- or more, monthly according to the size and scale of tneir establishments. In these circumstances -cue request seems justified for some alleviation equivalent to the additional and unforeseen expenditure which was not taken into considera tion when the terms of their emoluments were fixed and such alleviation might fairly take effect from the date of the imposition of the x«ew Customs Law.

Davies, Esquire, O.-o.E., nis .'iajesty’s Consul for Kerman and Fersian jDaluclaistan, Kerman. The Secretary to the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Busnire. Sir, I have the honour to address you regarding the with drawal by the Persian Government last autumn of tne pri vilege of exemption from Customs dues hitherto enjoyed by British Consuls and, at Kerman, by the Attache' also. 2. The cancellation of this privilege ias a serious effect upon the financial conditions of service of Indian Government officials in Persia. During the two and a half months since Customs charges have been levied (from the middle of September to the end of November;, i nave had to pay Krans 1014 in customs duties and rahdari tax, i.e. an average of over Rs. 112 per mensem. The charges during this period may be taken as certainly not less than the average, as, though the articles received include a consignment of clotnes (Customs charges 25&gt;j for tne whole winter, they do not include any stores whatsoever, (15$ customs dues) or any cigarettes, (60$ customs) nor does the amount of liquor imported (20 lerans per gross man customs and 5 Khans rahdari which works out roughly ^t 50$ advalorem on nett Indian retail prices) cover the average consumption of the period. 3. It appears therefore that the withdrawal of this concession will involve Consular officers in a serious financial loss which may be estimated at not less than Rs. 115 per mensem. It is true that the new Persian Govern ment rules provide that tnis privilege of exemption will be continued to Consuls-General, Consuls and 'Vice-Consuls de ■ ■de carriere dans les neuf inois de leur etaolisse:!i6nt 4&lt; btzt that is only on a basis of reciprocity. I am not quite clear whetner the phrase quoted means only for the first nine months after joining their first post in Persia, or after joining each post, or after eacn occasion on which they enter the country again on return from leave. In any case I understand the Persian Consuls in India and England are not exempt from Customs dues during the first nine months so t.iis conditional exemption is inoperative« 4. I nave therefore the nonour to request tnat the Hon*ole the Political Resident, if ne sees no objection may kindly approach tne Government of xndia for the grant of compensat on to those affected. I understand that on tne withdrawal of this privilege from tne members of the Indo-European Telegraph heparcment some 25 years ago the Government of India sanctioned an allowance of 5;i of tne ir pay which nas nov* been consolidated in their pay proper. On this analogy I propose a compensation of Rs. 100 for the Consul (srhicn is less than 5/S of the usual pay of the incumbent of this post, taking ^ay” as defined in tne fundamental Rules) and Rs. 20 for the Attache* (equivalent to 55 of his pay; or Rs.25 if xx his pay is raised to Rs.500 as in tne revision scheme at present under consideration. 5. In conclusion I may mention that it is practically impossible to obtain any of the requirements of entertain ment (stores and liquor) in Re man an I quite impossible to obtain any clothing or most of the minor necessities. Almost everything has to be imported at retail rates from India or England (the only exception being liquor on which a Customs rebate can be obtained for whole cases). I estimate tnat the whole of the existing -Guty allowance of Rs. 200 attached to this post is spent on no stage inside Persia, transport and forwarding charges, breakages, shortages, etc., together with the increased cost on account of transport, scarcity, etc., of such articles as can be bought locally. I therefore venture to urge thatthat it is only fair that the Government of India should a^'-ord special compensation -Co officers serving in Persia for the A exorbitant customs dues they now nave to pay, otnerwise service at these ports will be, by that aaount, more ex pensive than service in India and I have no doubt phat in course of time there will be a tendency for officers to cut down their entertaining proportionately which will have a most undesirable political effect.

In September 1923 the new tariff was introduced and Customs duties were levied from all those who had previously o ; jen exempt witn tne exception of the Consul-General who continues to enjoy tne previous immunity during the first nine 'iontns oi tne tenure of his appointment. fne new tariff is an exorbitant onei calculated on those articles which a European Resident in Persia must inroort it is over 200;$ above the old tariff (l920j and higher than the admittedly heavy Indiana luxury and is taxed 40 %i wines are placed in the sane category: a bottle of Vermouth at Rs. 2/8/- in India costs Rs.3/- in Bushire. In the case of the Secretary at Bushire actual figures show thao he is paying Rs. 200/- p.m. His scale of living and entertainment is strictly modest;. In the Gulf it is only officers serving on the Persian side who are penalized. inis is an invidious distinctions as service on the Persian is no less onerous and distasteful as on the Arab Coast** As regards Persia it can oe pointed out that the members of the indd-European Telegraph Department were given a 5% increase in pay in 1905 when the privilege of customs exemption was withdrawn and this was raised to 7-j|’ % in 1922 following the increased tariff of 1920. The members of the Consular and Diplomatic services in Persia are compensated by the bonus dependent on the cost of living which will automatically reflect the incidence of the new duties. It is suggested that officers from India serving in Persia wao previously enjoyea Customs immunity should in accordance with the precedent of the grant of a Customs allowance to the members of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in 1905 and in 1922 be granted a similar allowance with retrospective effect from September 1923 but calculated at 10^ on pay in view of the fact that the present customs tariff is more than 200# higher than that of 1920 on which the 7-g- # rise was granted. In the case of the Secretary at Bus-ire an allowance on a 10# basis would work out at Rs. 153/8/- p.m. as compared to Rs.200/- p.m. which the nev* tariff is costing aim.

I have the honour to state chat I understand tiiat representations have been addressed recently to zne Government of India by other Consular officers in Persia regarding ^he loss imposed upon them oy the abolition 01 cusooms exemption which tney have hitherto enjoyed. It is therefore not necessary for me to recapitulate tne facts tfiich have already been placed before the Government of India, but there is one point which I would venture to empnasise, and that is that if the new and exceedingly onerous customs duty impose^ neavy additional expenditure on officers resident in the Gulf, this is even more so in the case of officers at inland Consulates, who in addition to the customs duties, road tax, etc., nave to pay very heavy freights. As an example, I may mention that the freight from Duzdap to Meshed on a case of whislcy, while varying according to tne rate of exchange and the rate of transportation, is from Rs. 7/- to 8/- and in tne case of bulky commodities, such as provisions, it forms a very high percentage on tneir cost. 2. I may mention that during my recent visit to Tehran, 1 was informed that His Majesty’s Legation were addressing the London Foreign Office witn a view to trying to obtain some compensatory allowance for officers of the Levant Consular serving service./in Persia. I trust therefore the Government of India will favourably consider the representations addressed to them by tneiri*o. 244 19=8 His Majesty's Consulate Si stall as*&lt; Aain, Sistaiij 14'tn April 1929. From Major C.K. Daly, C.l.E., His Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Main, To The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Withdrawal of Customs exemption 'by the Persian Government from ^or' ign Consular officers in Persia. Sir, With reference to your x^o. P.29-3/29 of 28tn .iarch 19 29, x nave tne honour to state that I had, prior to receipt of your memorandum, considered the matter referred to therein with a view to representing to Government the nardsnip which is resulting to tne personnel of this Consulate in consequence of the withdrawal of customs exemption. As however 1 naa Put recently assumed charge of the Consulate, I was desirous of obtaining some personal experience of the extent of pecuniary loss incurred before applying to Government for a sympathetic consideration of any concrete proposals I could put fo rward. • 2. **-n tne first place I would draw attention to the fact that, not only does the withdrawal of customs exemption throw a considerable financial burden on all affected tnereby, but it has unfortunately co-incided with a considerable increase in the duties levied on many articles of regular consumption. Since my own arrival in Sistan a monopoly tax on topacco nas peen introduced, a furtner reference to which will oe made in this letter. 3. His* -majesty’s Vice Consul, Duzdap, who nas experience of longer duration than myself in this part of Persia, and having previously served in Persia, is in a position to compare his personal expenses with tnose previously incurred by him, has, at my request, furnished me with the(m W itn the following figures v/nion have been carefully checked from, records. During the period ne has oeen at Duzdap* &lt;29th October 1923 - arch 31st, 1929 ne paid in Customs duty and Road tax a sum of Krans 3,202 wiich at tne rate of exchange at that period Krans 360 = Rs. 100 is the equivalent of Rupees 387 or an average oi Rs. 177 per mensem. In this figure such items as monopoly tax, and post office permits, nave been excluded, so that it represents, not gross expenditure connected witn importation tnrougn tne customs, but net i ncre ase of expenditure directly due to the abolition of exemption. 4. Kor does the above calculation finally represent tne increased cost of living recently incurred, for the monopoly tax on sugar and tea, both of which nave oeen introduced since the emoluments of the personnel of this Consulate were last considered, has greatly increased their cost, and these with many other articles, are purchased locally. 5. To tne above expenditure must now be added tne very great increase resulting from tne recent imposition of the monopoly tax on tobacco referred to in paragraph 2, which was probably not brought to tne notice of Government in the representations referred to in your memorandum under reply. This tax is 50$ on the value after payment of all 1 taxes Ordinaires*. Tne Belgian Director of Customs at Duzdap informs me that this amounts to 50$ on tne value at Railhead, Duzdap plus Customs, plus Road tax, and will in effect be a tax of 235$ on the cost of tobacco and cigarettes in India. Taking an allowance of 25 cigarettes per diem, which includes provision for entertainment of guests (and Persians are prodigious smokers) and is a quite conservative estimate, and assuming the cost to be Rs. l/8 for 50 in Indie - t-ie cost of a quite modest brand of cigarette^, the consumption amounts to 750, value Rs. 22-8-0. The tax on this will be no less ,4 than Rs. 52-14-0There are 3* nurnher of furtner minor increases .niiicn nave occurred, -go enumerate which would be to un necessarily labour the point, but it may not oe out of place to mention that consequent on ill-wealth of many Europeans in !3ista.v\&gt; samples oi water at Duznap and Sistan have been analysed and found totally unfit for dirnking by Europeans. All water for this, and culinary purposes, must now be distilled, at a cost of, ?.t the very least, Rs. 20 per mensem. 6. Taking into consideration the figures referred to above I estimate! that the minimum net increases in cost of living in the case of European officers, living on a scale which I can assure Government is by no means extravagant and the minimum consistent with the upkeep of the dignity of his -fay esty * s Representa tives, amounts to Rs. 177 plus Rs. 52/4 plus Rs. 20 - Rs. 249-4-0. Should Government of India be disposed to grant to officers serving in Sis tan some alleviation in respect of this unexpected and unavoidable increase in expenditure, the question arises of tae form such alleviation should take. I had at first considered tne possibility of a percentage increase in pay, but I an convinced that this would operate most inequitably, for tne increase in cost of living at a particular post cannot materially vary for different incumbents and a percentage allowance would result in the officer with low basic pay, on w ion the increased cost would relatively bear more heavily, receiving less compensation tnan a higher paid officer appointed to the sane post, who could better afford tne increase• I would therefore submit that any allowances which Government may be pleased to grant should take the form of a fixed local or compensatory allowance for each appointment, irrespective of tne incumoents salary. Tnis would have a further advantage in eliminat-L _ I mm eliminating inucli account v r orK, smoe t_ie alio /ancc vvi 7 ^ A not fluctuate with increases of salary. 7 # in submitting the attached list ol tne personnel of this Consulate affected by the changes, togetner with the comoensatory allowances recomnended and wnich I trust it will be possible for the Gpv&amp;mment of India to favourably consider, I have taken into careful consideration the degree to which §ach incuinbe it is affected, aaving regard to his status, node of living, and extent to whicn he can reasonably be expected to live on the country, and thus avoid heavy importations and consequent customs duty. As regards ivos. 1, 2, and 3 on the list append ed, I would point out that the incumbents have to live in the usual European style and tne allowances are based on the actual, calculable increase in cost of living. libs. 4, 5, 6 and 7 are usually held by British Indian subjects, whose habits of life enable them to live more largely on the country. They are however adversely affected by the ligh cost of certain articles of general consumption such as tea, sugar and atta (the local variety being quite unpalatable to Indians;. Tne allowances recommended for these posts are on a basis of roughly lO/o of the average pay drawn by the incumbents. Purther I beg to request that any allowances Government may be pleased to grsuit may ii possi Ole nave xsxxsps retrospective effect from the date of aboli tion of exemption from customs duty. 8. a proposition statement shewing the cost of these recommendations in the current year and tne proposed means of meeting the expenditure is attached to this letter. 9 .

In his letter Ho. 141/21/2 of the 23rd of February 1929, iqy predecessor urged brieily that if any concessions were extended to officers serving in Persia to compensate tnem for the loss of Customs exemption, the appointment of the Consul-General in Khorasan should be included in the scope oi such concessions. fne appointment of tne Consul-General is tne only one in this office which has hitnerto benefitted by tne Customs exemption. In asking for detailed proposals, I presume you do not wish ne to expand the arguments brought i or ward by ^olonel j^i^coe for tne ground nas been amply covered by tne resident in Bushire. briefly as a result of losing the Customs exemption officers will have to pay 50 per* cen 6 more r or vhiisicy, nearly 100 per cent more for vermouth and 45 per cent more for beer, other wines and st./r^ ^ snow the sa le increase. lobacco will become almost prohibitive for tne increase as worked out by tne Customs in Meshed comes to 250 per cent; in other words, the cost of a consignment of tobacco costing Rs. 50 will be Rs. 175 in Meshed exclusive of freight. 2. It is impossible to suggest a standard which will apply equally to all the posts in Persia and the Gulf, as conditions differ too widely. Some places are on the sea andand freight charges for English stores, etc. are extremely light compared with tne charges in a place lire he sired. Social conditions also differ from place to place. In Kerman, for example, when I was tne re, there were not many visitors from the outside world. In Meshed on tne other nand, now thai the overland mororin ; route from India is 'becoming popular and especially now tnat a weekly aeroplane service nas b en introduced between Mesned and ie.hran, visitors are frequent, and I apprehend that the Consul-'General at Meshed in future will have a good deal more of entertainment than ne had before and at a very great increase of cost. It seems to me that if entertainment allowances were properly graded originally, they should form an obvious basis for calculating the concession if such is sanctioned. I do not think that salary is a reasonable basis except where there is no sumptuary allowance. I suggest therefore for the Consul-Ceneral in hesned an increase of his sumptuary allow'ance by 33 1/3 per cent. bhis will, so far as nis appointment is concerned, involve/ an additional expenditure in the current year of 166/lO/B x 12 - Rs.2,000 as I understand that I am not entitled .to Customs exemption having xgxx# served in Persia before. 1 propose that this be net from the amount which will be saved under the head 'Pay ani Allowances to thejaub-Assistant Surgeon'* should that appointment remain vacant for the rest of tne year as 1 have suggested in a separate communication. I enclose the necessary proposition statement. 3. It should be expressly laid down that such increase as tne Government of India may be good enough to sanction should be paid only on production of a certificate signed by tne officer concerned to the effect tnat he has not enjoyed Customs exemption during the month forwaich he drav/s increase of pay or of sumptuary allowance, fhis is necessary as in certain cases - namely, officers appointed substantively who nave not served in Persia o;fore — exemption Iron Customs will be given for 9 months. ^ regret tnat I do not understand what is meant by your request that the divisible and non-divisible items of expenditure should be shown separately.

Sir, With reference to correspondence ending vrith this Residency memorandum Jo. 762 dated the 30th march 1929, I have the honour to report that the members of my clerical staff have now petitioned me for the grant to them of a Customs Compensatory allowance on account of the ennanced Customs tariff which has increased the cost of living and made their conditions of service more difficult. The need for improving the conditions of service of the clerical establishment in tne Persian Gulf was fully argued by Sir Lionel nawortn in nis letter ^o. 5-64/149, dated the 3rd January 1928 with which he submitted nis revision proposals. Those proposals, however, were based on the 1920 tariff and did not anticipate tne present rise in the cost of living, neither did the recommendation for Gulf allowance which I urged as a temporary measure to meet the much needed relief take into account the additional hardship imposed on those serving in Persia by the new tariff.

On the analogy of tiie above relief to members o± the Indo-Suropean Telegraph .'department ststf, I earnestly urge that the Government of India oe pleased to sanction the grant of a Customs Compensatory allowance to members of the Persian Gulf clerical establishment serving in Persia, at the following rates with effect from 1st April 1929. Gazetted Officers (not previously entitled to Customs exemption) ® Rs. 50 per mensem. Clerics, Grades I and II @ Rs. 25 per mensem. Clerks, Grades III and IV ® Rs. 15 per mensem. Tne total cost of the-proposal will be ns. 6 360/- per annum as shown in tne accompanying proposition statement.

The present system whereby after certain formalities which necessarily in volve waoiatdwrattgn considerable clerical labour and delay, a drawback of 15/l6th of duty is ultimately recoverable at Duzdap, was framed to reimburse Government for the labour involved by the necessity for the Customs Department to seal and supervise trade consignments of goods for Bast Persia* Such necessity can hardly be said to exist in the case of goods imported for the personal use of members of H*M*s Consulates and their staffs, as the requisite certificate confirming the arrival of the goods in Persia would be furnished by H»M’s Consuls* 4* As regards postal parcels, duty does not appear to be collected at l/l6th, presumably because no labour is involved for the customs authorities, the parcels coming directly through hSTORES IJMPORTED FOR THE USE OF BRITISH LEGATION AT KABUL.
