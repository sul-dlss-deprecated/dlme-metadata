He sits beside a larger, unidentified figure of a woman who may be his mother. The unusual depiction of four large storage vessels at the bottom may be symbolic of wombs.\r\nLimestone funerary stela. The stela is round-topped. At the top are two \"wadjet\" - eyes. Below the eyes, to the left, are two people seated upon a lion-legged chair. The smaller person holds a lotus in his right hand down by her knees. Above the women is a text. Before the legs of the smaller man is also a text. Before the pair is a small offering table. \r\nOn the right side of this table are two registers of small figures. The upper register shows a standing woman followed by a male figure with his right arm raised. Before the female is an inscription; before the male is an inscription. Below these two figures is a seated woman nursing a child. Before her face is a text; before her legs another text. These two figures are done in a very poor sunk relief. The bottom register has a representation of a row of four offering vessels in sunken relief. \r\nCondition: Front surface blackened with chips and scratches; arms of standing woman chipped away; gouge marks on all edges.", "medium": "Limestone", "dimensions": "14 7/8 x 9 1/16 x 3 5/8in.
