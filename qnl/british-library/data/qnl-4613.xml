Provided that he has no personal ambitions and havino- regard to the considerate manner in which the Chief treats him, I think it is qtite pos- sib e that Sheikh Ah bin Mahomed may have been entrusted by Sheikh Esa with some secret mission to the Turkish authorities in Baghdad. \\t lt . ls common gossip in the bazaar that Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab Pasha is afraid to return to Bahrein, because the British have detected his complicity in some act of treachery towards them I It seems that this worthy has arranged to make Debai his head-quarters during the present pearling season: as he left Bahrein last January on the friendliest of terms with me, and I have had no communication with him since, it is difficult to understand his motive for scanning Bahrein which has always been his place of residence at this time of year. 3; T ^ ird jy' I II have J h ^ rd ^ om two sources—one a Persian shop-keeper and the other Sheikh Hamad bin Mahomed -that the Chief has had frequent inter- views w^h Monsieur Perronne, the Frenchman who recently arrived here osten- sibly tor the purchase of pearls, and the Persian's report runs that the Chief has invited M. Perronne to fly the French flag. I had previously received a reliable report that M Perronne had paid one visit to the Chief, and at my last mtemew with the latter. Sheikh Esa also informed me of this fact and asked whether there were any objections to the Frenchman's staying in Bahrein Until therefore, I should receive further evidence of underhand conduct on the Chiefs' part 1 telt unable to credit the rumour above mentioned and accordincrly did not report it last week. To-day 1 hear on reliable authority that M &amp; . Perronneis on the friendliest of terms with Sheikh Mahomed bin Ahmed, a brother of the fugitive Sheikh Ali. It is possible therefore that this Sheikh may have been acting as confidential medium between the Chief and the Frenchman. On the other hand the intimacy may merely have originated from the general belief in the antipathy existing between Germans and Frenchmen, which may have prompted Sheikh Mahomed bin Ahmed to seek M. Perronne's sympathy for his brother. 5. On all these points I hope to gain further information during the next few days. It is difficult to believe that Sheikh Esa can entertain for a moment the hope that he can with the help of any other Power effect the rupture of the ties which bind him to us/but I am sure that his son Sheikh Hamad would use all his influence and power to bring about such an end if he could. So long as the Government of India were willing to act as a buffer between Bahrein and all foreign Governments and at the same time to give the Chief and his family a free hand in their acts of tyranny and misrule over the unfortunates whom they had conquered little more than a century ago, the position was an ideal one from the Khalifa's point of view. 6. At the present day the Treaty of 1820 is almost a dead letter. The Trucial flag is never seen and slaves are bought and imported not only constantly from Katar and Hasa but even occasionally, I am told, direct from Sur in Oman. I have reason also to believe that the agreement of 1898 on the subject of the Arms Traffic is similarly disregarded. These are the reasons why Sheikh Esa dreads the proposed scheme for the reformation of his Customs, and at the same time they should—I venture to say—stimulate us to insist upon the Sheikh's complete submission to our will. g. c. press, ?imla.—no. c253 f. d.— i4-6-o5'--67 ~ r« s. w.v7 Confidential.

Agent, Bahrein, I have the honour to state that this individual has been closely watched since his arrival in the Gulf, and I submit for the information of the Government of India a copy of the last Memo randum furnished to the Central Criminal Intelligence Department, Simla, by my First Assistant under date 14th May. Cofy of a Memorandum forwarded to the Director, Central Criminal Intel' ligence Department ) under Residency endorsement No. 645* dated 14th May 190S' % The Frenchman Gaston Perronne referred to in this office Memorandum No. 530, dated 16th April 1905, is a smartly dressed little man with a healthy florid complexion, narrow brown moustache and dark brown eyes; age about 26 years, height between 5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 6 inches, and stoutly built for his height. Speaks English very fairly. He states that a year or two ago he completed his term of compulsory service in the^ French Army, that having an adventurous spirit and some little means of his own, he went towards 1 ibet presumably, vid China and there invested in musk and skins which eventually brought him a profit of ^'3,000. He now intends to try his luck at pearls for a season at Bahrein and hopes to go back to China next cold weather. Monsieur Gaston Perronne travelled up to Bushire and after completing his period of quarantine spent 2 days ashore and then returned to Bahrein. His fellow passenger was one Mahammed Ali bin Haji Ahmed Khan (the Sadid-es- Sultaneh) who was formerly Persian Foreign Office Agent and Passport Officer at Bushire and is now the Russian Consular Agent at Bunder Abbas. The Sadid introduced him to 2 leading Arab merchants of Menama (Bahrein). On the strength of a letter of introduction secured by M. Perronne from Haji Abdul Rahman, French Consular Agent, Lingah, Abdul Rahman bin Idan readily leased him a new house at Bahrein for such period as he may require it. e. &amp; P tmi .

Fraser , Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to your telegram, dated 14th instant, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of Captain Prideaux's letter No. 175, dated 27th May 1905, which should have accompanied my letter No. 249, dated 4th instant. No. 175, dated Bahrein, the 27th May 1905. From— Captain F, B. Prideaux , Political Agent, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 162, dated the 19th May 1905, on the subject of the rumours that the Chief of Bahrein is attempting to place himself under the protection of another Power, I have the honour to report that as the result of my enquiries I am unable to believe that Sheikh Esa has personally yet involved himself in written correspondence with either the Turks or the French. 2. I do not think it likely that Sheikh Ali bin Mahomed would be selected by the Chief as his mouth-piece in making overtures to the Turks nor that he would consent to act as such if he were, ^ I have learnt that M. Perronne has only once been to Muharraq, but on that occasion he stayed there the whole day, and besides calling on the Chief he visited most of the notabilities of the place. 4 It is probable that Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab Pasha is at the bottom of the rumour under investigation. He is in the habit of corresponding occasionally with all the foreign Consuls in Bushire and poses as the sincere well-wisher of each He also is unofficially recognized by the people of Bahrein as the mouth piece of the Turks, whose subject he is. The two^ or three persons, whom I have confidentially consulted, are unanimous m thinking that Mahomed bin Abdul Wahab has been sounding both the Turkish and French Consuls at Bombay on behalf of Sheikh Esa, and that the statement made by the Turkish Ambassador in London to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs can only be founded on some communication made by Mahomed Pasha either verbally in Bombay or by letter to some other Turkish official I couple my mention of the French with that of the Turks, because locally there is no rumour of the latter having been approached, while the belief is fairly popular that some intrigue is in existence between the Chief and M. Perronne. It seems possible that the latter may have communicated to the French Consul in Bombay some enquiry of the Chiefs as to the likelihood of his being assisted by the French Government. c. As regards Mahomed Pasha, it is well known that he was the instrument which brought Sheikh Jassim bin Thani into the meshes of the Turkish Empire, and that he has often urged Sheikh Esa to follow the same course. From bheikh Esa's letter, a translation of which I am submitting to you to-day under cover of a separate report No. 174, it is also. I think, evident that the Chief has already considered the possibility of this move. It is natural, too, that the course of recent events in Koweit and Nejd should influence the mind of the Ruler of Bahrein to some extent. 6. Takino- the above points into consideration I do not think that the reason given in the last paragraph of your telegram of the 17th May 1905 to the Secre tary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, for not confronting Sheikh Esa with the report has much force, if I may be permitted to say so. but at the same time I am quite of opinion that until the Turkish Ambassador presents proofs to show that the Chief 4ias acted in a manner which we should regard as tantamount to rebellion against the Government of India, it is supererogatory tor us to accuse him of such an act.

The telegram is a repetition in greater detail of the complaint which Ilusurus Pasha was instructed to make on February C^nd and which is recorded in Lord * Lansdowne 1 s despatch to Ilr. Townley Ho. 59 of that date, forwarded to you on Ilarch 1st. In both cases it is alleged that punitive measures vrere taken in consequence of an assult on a European, wherewas, according to the reports received from the Government of India,reparation for the mal treatment of the German subject, Ilr. Bahnsen, was obtained by Hajor Cox in December last, without the assistance of H.II 0 Ships and it was in connection with an attack upon Persian subjects that the naval demonstration of FebruaryFebruary last became nece.ji:ury. ITiie present document contains other and more serious misstatements; the allegations that the Bahrein customs were occupied by British Officers and fishing . dues levied are clearly entirely without foundation and the account given of the proceedings against Sheikh Ali, when compared with the reports furnished by the Admiralty, appears to be incorrect in nearly es every particular. 'usurus Pasha has again been instructed to press for an answer, and Lord Lansdowne would propose to reply that the report received by the Turkish Government from the Cor.-f.nfler of the 6th Army Corps at Bughclad is, in many material respects, incorrect and exaggeri-ted, but tiiat lt ^Vt..r^ment cannot discuss the details of the measures taken; that they can only repeat the statement made to His Excellency on 22nd of February last and in Sir p.

One proof of the compromising of Persian rights over antient subjects is the present proposal for the intervention of the Brit: Con: Gen: on ESS behalf of the inhabitants of Bahre^^i who are Persian subjects. Such also is the title of Sheikh &amp; th^attributing of ownership ofjjahrein to him &amp; the conclusion of treaties with him.Such action which is in fact interfering with their lawful territory must necessarily draw forth a ptotest from the Persian Govt:, They request that treaty obligations regarding subjects of the Shah sight of should not be lost gfiBHEBEC by H.M.Govt;.It should be the earnest desite of the Brit: Govt: to confirm Persian subjects in their allegiance to the Shah , see Art: 14 treaty of 1857. Although there is no actual incivility in the lang uage of the above the tone of the note appears to me to be open to objection, &amp; I await instructions as to whether its receipt should be refused or not. There has been a growing incivilijyy fofc some time in the tone of the commu/ricat ions addressed to the Legation here &amp; they say openly at Court that Japan hajshown Westerii Powers what orientals oan do.

In telegraphing the substance of His Excellency's note to you I renture to express the opinion that although the language of the enclosed communication was not actually uncivil, its tone appeared to me to be open to objection, In these circumstances I had the honour to ask for your instructions as to whether I should decline to receive it. The note bears every mark of being the Shah's own composition, as I doubt whether either the Grand Vizier or the Mushir-ed-Dowleh would on their own initiative have addressed such a communication to the representative of a Foreign Government. I am confidentially informed that the tone at the Persian Court is very anti-European, the Shah and his courtiers apparently believing that what Japan can do Persia is also in a position to accomplish. In a country where the administration is hardly on a level with that of Hayti or San Domingo, and where the chief power is in the hands of a sovereign compared to whom Bomba was an enlightened patriot, such pretentions can only excite mirth, but I have reported the matter as a curious and perhaps significant effect of the late Russo-Japanese War on Persian thought.

In reply to the note addressed by the British Legation respecting the natives of Bahrein, I have the honour to state that in the case of Bahrein and its inhabitants the Persian Government, who consider that place its own unquestionable property and its people its own subjects, and who in accordance with the sacred treaties expected every assistance from the friendly Power in case of any emergency, see that during this time contrary to the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1867 all steps taken by the English officials had no other object but to weaken the allegiance of the people and the Sheikhs of Bahrein to the Persian Government and to establish their own authority in the bond fide property of the Persian Government as it has been also meant in the note under reply. Frequent representations and protests have been made both here and in London, but although the British Government have taken no exception to the ownership and 'sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, the British Govern ment have not allowed Persian legal rights to be enforced there.2 The present proposals for the mtervention of the British Consul-Generai on behalf of the Bahreinis, who are Persian subjects, is one proof of the compro mising of the rights of the Persian Government over their ancient sub jects. Such is the new title given to the Sheikh of Bahrein calling him the owner of that place and concluding treaties with him. Under these circumstances the Peisian Government is obliged : first, to protest against all such measures which are m fact taking possession of and interfering with its lawful territories and subjects; and, secondly, to requestllis Britannic Majesty's Government not to lose sight of the treaty obligations, and that it should be their earnest desire to confirm the allegiance of the Persian subjects to His Imperial Maiesty the Shah as it is expressly stipulated in the Treaty of 1857. 6257 JT.

Sir E.

I have the honour to inform you that I have received instructions from Sir E. Grey to reply to Your Excellency's communication in the following terms :— The treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 on the subject, have always been scru pulously observed by His Majesty's Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty's Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein and such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible. His Majesty's Government consider the Island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. I am further to mention that this reply has invariably been made to the Ottoman Government who have on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein. Sir E. Grey instructs me to remind Your Excellency of the action taken by the British Authorities in November 1904 for the protection of Persian traders at Bahrein and of your telegram forwarded on that occasion to the Persian com munity of which the following is the purport: ' To the merchants and traders of the High Government living in Bahrein. Your telegram on the subject of the assaults which have been made upon you by the Arab roughs of Bahrein has been received. Certainly let your minds be at rest. Consultations with the English Legation have taken place on this subject and it will shortly be settled in such a way that the oppression will be removed and that the offenders will receive their proper punishment.'

'^ated l^th of Pajab IT-24. to The Editor. sir, I have read what has been recorded in your esteemed paper of the views of the learned traveller who wrote from Karachi .luscat and Lingah, and I have been encouraged to write something about the island of Bahrein, in the hope that you will kindly find space for it in your esteemed paper, Bahrein Island is situated in the Turkish 'ulf, not far from the Persian 'ulf and is refuted for its good cli mate and 'vvater and its extensive trade. The island is 1^ miles long with a population of about 70,000 souls. There are here a good number of Hindus merchants, but Persian ana European merchants are few. The biggest occupation of the place is pearl-trade, and most of its pearl produce goes to India from where the bulk of its import comes. Bahrein pearls are noted for their purity orient and value. Coffee is imported, most of it from America and from i-Ialabar and rice from Bengal. ;7ugar of various kinds is imported. The '''■ermans are the principal dealers in American coffee. Some 7000 pearling boats belong to Bahrein and pearling is the main occupation and source of livelihood of the population. There are Just about 5 per cent literate people and some 10 schools in Bahrein, but the people have little in clination towards education, in spite of the fact that the mail-steamers have connected the islands with the civilis ed world and have provided source of light and information. The Government is Arab having for its seat the islandIsland of iuuharrac. The ruler of Bahrein is called f.heikh, Sheikh Esa bin Sheikh i\li A1 I^halifa. He attends his chamber of audience every morning when a large number of the Arab Bedouins and servants collect round him to con gratulate him and bid him ha^py mornings, A little later his sons appear. They are, Sheikh Hamad the heir apparent, and Sheikhs iluhammad and Abdullah, and are every inch like their father ana generally show no interest in the Govern ment, tfow the authority in the island is gradually being transferred from the hands of the Sheikh to those of the British Consul, Captain Prideaux, This is due to the Sheikh's indifference and neglect of his duties, and on the other hand, to the seal and justice of the latter (i, e. the Consul) ana to the easy submission of the Sheikh to him. But what astonishes me most is the indifference of the Ottoman Government towards this Island, inspite of its situation in their Gulf and inspite of the fact that the island in reality is theirs, ^he'^nglislT'^'re~fe^v- in the islands but act like des potic rulers, and what they did to Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed is a reflex of their position. This incident of Sheikh Ali is well remembered in Bahrein, of the burning down of his boats his furniture and his goods, o^ smashing down his house apartments, of seising upon his horses camels and animals and stores and arms# and of distributing nis arms to the missionaries in Bahrein Bussorah and Bushire, The affair, which led to these insulting acts, was quite a smal one. A servant of Sheikh Ali fell out with a servant of the Germans and. they both assaulted each other. A^heikh .Ali was at the time accused of harbouring a party deadly aga inst the Persians, while the fact is T jhat it is the Per sians who are the aggressors and prone to mischief. To this the whole of Bahrein population can testify. The English were not satisfied with what they did in the of insulting and disgracing Sheikh Ali and they aaaed to what they did by levying Bs .2.000/- fine in two pieces, ana laterlater Bent him off a prisoner to India. Arats of Bahrein TTejd and Koweit, Oman and of places atout there were wedd ed to the opinion that their rights and liberties were respected by the English, and they really 'believed that the English were their well-wishers, their staunch friends promoters of their good and a people that never meant to dispossess them of their country or to create trouble on earth, but now, the incident of r.heikh Ali has shattered this their belief, and their eyes have now been opened to the painful prospect afforded by the greedy intentions of the foreigners. Especially since after the incident of ^inshwai, since they have read accounts' of the harrowing and distressing incident, the heartless doings of the British, they have completely changed in their beliefs. I have read out to many of them the account of the incident and have sent copies to many people in these parts of the country. r r ours Truly).

The instructions were for the public to hold iloiud reading parties in gra titude to ^-od for the recovery of H. T.M. In the Vilayet of Basra we are told Molud parties were organised and successfully carried through. T 'e also took up the matter here and I consulted the *-aib Kazi ana we agreed to hold a nlolud party and to invite in it the elites of Bahrein. Accordingly we invited all the big people ana merchants and set ourselves about organising the party in a fitting manner.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 51 of the 27th February last, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a note from the Persian Government on the subject of the sovereignty over the Island of Bahrein claimed by His Majesty the Shah. The Grand Vizier mentions in the inclosed note an Agreement made in 1822 between His Majesty 's Government and the Persian Government, in which the former recognise the Island of Bahrein as a dependency of the Province of Ears. I presume His Highness refers to the Agreement made in that year by the British Resident at Bushire and disowned by His Majesty's Government. As I informed the Persian Government, under the instructions contained in your telegram No. 28 of the 9th February last, that His Majesty's Govern ment decline to entertain any further representations on the subject of the Persian claim to sovereignty over Bahrein, I have returned no reply to the Grand Vizier's communication. There are a few outstanding claims at Bushire in which Bahreinis are interested, and I have been for the last year trying to settle these cases amicably with the Persian Government. If it should be impossible to obtain justice for the parties concerned, the details of these claims will be brought to your notice in due course, according to your instructions (see your telegram No. 28 of the 9th February last). I have, &amp;c., Evelyn Grant Duff. Inclosure in No. 1. i' 1 m i Grand Vizier to Mr. E. Grant Duff. 13th September 1906. (Translation.) I have received and submitted to His Imperial Majesty the Shah your undated letter [19th February last ] respecting Bahrein. I have now the honour to state that, in view of the former proceedings, and also in view of the friendship existing between the two Governments, I did not expect to see the two following paragraphs in your note :— 1. ' His Majesty's Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim is, in their opinion, entirely inadmissible'. 2. ' His Majesty's Government consider the Island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection '. Not to speak of the fact that the spirit of the Treaties explains and demonstrates the rights of the Persian Government over the Island in question, such an answer has never been put forw r ard in the correspondence on the subject which has passed between the high officials of the two Governments in London and Tehran, and apparently it is the first time that such an answer has been given by the British Legation. To refrain from giving a long and detailed reply to this statement, I content myself on this occasion with a reference to a distinct Agreement made2 between the high officials of the two Governments on the 30th August 1822 and signed by Sir William JBruce, the Special Commissioner of the British Government. In the Agreememt in question the decision about the case was as rollows:— a ^ T T 116 . of Bal i r ein has always been a dependency of Fars. The Bani Attabeh mhaoitants of the Island disobeyed the orders of the Fars authorities and applied to the Military Commander for a flag. The flag will be taken back it already given, and hereafter protection will be refused to the Arabs mentioned above'. • i J 0 v; ew of , tlie clear expressions used in your previous note, in which the nghts of the Persian Government over the Island in question have not been denied, I hope you will continue to follow the former opinion of the British Crovernment in regard to the rights of the Persian Government over that s and, and you will not interpret my telegram addressed to the trading classes in Bahrein to mean anything but a mark of friendship between the two Governments. Ihe telegram in question does not in any way compromise the rights of the Persian Government over the Island. If there is anv statement to be made in regard to certain difficulties about the inhabitants of the Island it is a separate question, which must be settled according to justice. i i t N ^ TE ;~ J c ^ nnot I the exact English text of the Agreement referred to, buti thmk the Grand A izier refers to the Agreement made in 1822 between the British Resident at Bushire and the authorities in Fars. This Aoreement was not; ratified by His Majesty's Government, and the Resident was recalled.—A. K. Annex. Memorandum hy Mr, Brant on Agreement loith Persia of 30th August 1822 regarding Bahrein.

The 4th section of Article V contains an undertaking to give naval as sistance to a Persian expedition against Bahrein. This Agreement was entirely contrary to the views of the Government at Bombay, and letters were written to the Prince of Shiraz disavowing the Treaty m strong terms and announcing the recall of Captain Bruce. 3 Not only did the Indian Government disavow the Treaty but Mr G Wiliock, British Representative at Tabreez, reported that— ' Mirza Baugur, Anhie, who had been deputed to Court to obtain the ratification of the Treaty, did not meet with a favourable reception ; and His Majesty the Shah whilst refusing his accordance to the stipulations, expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into anv engage ments with the British Government without his knowledge and injunctions'? This Agreement was therefore disavowed by the Indian Government in the most explicit manner, and it appears to have failed to secure the sanction or the Shah. ^ R W B Foreign Office, 31st October 1906.1^ Confidential, - Wo, Eo Be A copy of the foregoing c z / forwarded With i spare copy to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for information, in continuation of the endorsement of the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No. 91-E.B., dated the 11th January 1907.

Besides the fact that the agreement is one which has been made between e officials of the two Governments and the abrogation of it is not at all known o the Persian Government who consider it binding, the object of my note was t a an officially appointed British officer (all the British officers have always een known for their experience and knowledge) has recognized the right 0 e Persian Government over the island in question and given evidence as to e status of the island at that time, testifying to the rights of Persia as an eyewitness. Even if the agreement which had reference to certain measuies had, as supposed by the British Government, been abrogated, that would not se e matter and the Persian Government hopes, in view of the justice whic is a ways expected from the British Government, that the latter will not lose sigio ancient rights of the Persian Government which had in different cases een re cognized by her and will not refrain from acting in harmony on all occasions.

As you are of course aware no engagement between nations is binding until it has been formally ratified by the proper authorities. According to the information in my possession, and which is doubtless also to be found in the archives of the Persian Foreign Office, not only was the Treaty disavowed by the proper representatives of His Britannic Majesty's Government, but His Majesty the Shah refused to recognize its stipulations and expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.

Some 3 months ago, a Persian named Haji Muhamnu^ Ardokuni came to Manama from Bombay# He put up 11 '■ ii 11 ■ •Ardokun is said to A a village near Ya^d# in the house of Haji Abdun Nabi Kazeruni, the Lahding small Contractor, and opened a shop for the sale of books in the Bazar# He has given out that he has lived 15 years in Bombay, and kept a book-shop and a printing press in Bhindi Bazar near the Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy Hospital# There seems hoever to be some mystery about the cause of his leaving India, an.d it is believed here that he does not intend to return to Bombay. As the educated Persian community in Bahrain is a very small one, there is little likelihood of the man staying in these islands much longer, and it is said that he has forwarded some Es:2000/- worth of books to a friend, Haji Ghulam Lari, in Linga with a view to his establish ing himself at that port# In Bahrain, Haji Muhammad has been selling a few copies of a newspaper named ••Kashkol 11 , as well as books on various subjects - reli gion, history, fables and stories.for children- besidesseveral eaii/ions 01 ■une' Jioran, ^ The man is a Shia and from his conversation evidently holds identical'views with those expressed in the f Majlis 1 article, though he now says that the Persian official here should be oft^loil a 'Karguzar* not a Consul. 3, I think it might be useful to refer to the Bombay Police for further details of this individual's history, as he seems to be somewhat anti-British, I have the honour to be Your most obedient servant Captain, Political Agent, Bahrain,Gonf identaul ' p rom Uo.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 61 of March 27th last relative to the Persian claim on Bahrein, I have the honour to enclose herewith copies of further correspondence with the Persian Government on the subject. You will observe that the Persian Government disregards the previous communications which I had made and renews the claim to the sovereignty of the is land onthe ground that a subordinate British officer acknowledged the claim as valid in 1822. ^ . I asked the Ala-es-Sultaneh how the Persian Government could renew a claim which as I had explained had been formally disavowed by a Shah of Persia. He said that he had forgotten what had happened about the question but that* recently some one had come to him from the Assembly to say that the claim must be urged because the British themselves had acknowledged it in 1822. He asked me if I could communicate to him the Shah's desket in order to show it to the Assembly who were very insistant. I said I would send him a short historical memorandum as to the status of Bahrein which would no doubt satisfy his friend. The origin of this communicatian is no doubt the desire of certain persons connected with the Assembly, probably the Mouin-el-Tujjer to ^et hold of pearl fishing right in order to sell them at a profit. The question will be borne in mind and a further communication will be sent you. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, (Sd.) CICIL SPRING-RICE.

If, in the meantime, an agreement has been made by them, and even at agreement may not have been put into force the fact will have no bearingon the recognmon by the British officers of the rights of the Persian Government over the island of Bahrein.

Paper in order to at tract the attention of the Members of Parliament and the Ministers of the Government.In future also,when ever confidential informations and secret intelli gence are required,! shall be ready to endeavour in obtaining them and communicating them to fully. Bahrein is a prosperous island in the Persian Gulf,having 560 populous villages, and flawing springs of fresh water. Its soil is fertile and soft and fit for all sorts of cultivations and different kind of trees. Its weather is agreeable, but notwithstanding the suitableness of the soil axid of the weather and the abundance of water,the Arabs of that place,being nuturally unfamiliar with botanybotany, engage themselves in planting date palms and pay less attention to other things. However,fruit 'trees are found there such as arange, bannana,Lowz, tamarind,mulberry,mango,cocoanut etc. The total population of this island is 23000 souls more or less. Of this upward of 4000 are Persians and subj jects of the Exalted (Persian) Government.,the rest being Arabs. r rhe History of Bahrein has been frequent ly written and published by contemporary literarymen and those who are versed in politics. There are no^ at Teheran persons who possess full and thorough inlorma tion concerning all the affairs of those parts.A con siderable quantity of pearl is fished every year from the Bahrein Sea and exported to India,-iurope,etc, in additon to^Sadaf 'and other kinds of mother of pearls. Different kinds of merchandise such as Indian rice, coffee, tea,sugar,loafand soft,piece goods ironwares, haberdashery,kerosine oil etc are annually imported in to Bahrein from India,in large quantities and from Europe and Persian Ports in small quantities. The Government q I ' this island is (heredi tary) in the family of the Ali Khalifah Sheikhs,and the present Sheikh is Isa bin Ali who considers him self to be under British protection. From ancient times,Bahrein was included in the Persian Empire and its Sheikhs were tributary and submisssive to the Soverigns of those territories and. still the Firmans of the Brave King Nader Shah,written in uhe handwriting of Mirza Mehdi Khan Munshi— ul—Memali-^,foim the family souvenirs and keepsakes of the Sheikhs. Since sometime past the date of which I do not re member the Persian Authorities, unfortunately owing to internal troubles,gave up and abandoned this pros perous country of their own, and on the other hand, 'the Whale of British Isles'swollowed this island, in consideration of the politics of India, like a great portion of the Oman Sea. vhrntrhThough it will saenx that no benefit is anticipated by the British Government in taking possession of these parts and that,moreover&gt;they always give large sums of money to the Sheikhs,out of their pocket,in the shape of presents,donations and aidf but those who are versed in politics know wall that the only poli tical object of the aid Government is to make en croachments and obtain possessions in this Gulf or the sea of Oman. Why the Persian Government have lost sight of their interests in Bahrein is not necessary to be described .(here) and the reasons are well known to all and you can read them without my reducing them to writing. At first the English had only a Consular Agent,who was often from amongst the people of Bushir e and was under the Eushire Residency superintending over the Hindus who were trading in that pla,ce. It is now some time since several firms belonging to the English and the Germans have been opened there (i. e. at Manama whib is the centre of the island) and the steamers of the British India Co and of the German Co etc touch there every week and every month. The re sidenee of the British Consular Agent consisted,previously,of a building belonging to the people of that place which used to be taicen on rant. Six years ago,the Government constructed a grand building with considerable expense,and replaced the old Consular Agent by a Political Agent and the whole control over the (local) administration is in their hands; but others have neither Consul nor Flag, and whenever they (other nationa.litis) have desired the Sheikhs (to permit the establisliment of the Con sulate) he has yeilded,but the English have presented it. The Customs of that place has been formed at Rs 130600/ per annum by a Hindu but, he certainly receives an income of more than Rs 600000 per annum. Two years ago,the British Government made urgent requests that they themselves should adminster the Customs and pay thetfO 10$ trie Sheikh Ks ?0000Q annually, i'earing tliat the affair may pass out of Ms hand-s, absolutely,he contented him self with the small payment made by the Hindu and did not consent to the English adminstration.I forward a seperate memorandum showing the Sheikh's present in come for your information and that of the National del legates and the officials of the Government. It is said that once upon a time, a Bahreini Syed having come to Persia on pilgrimage to Meshed, met the late Prince Hesam-es-Saltaneh at Shiraz and was asked by His Royal Highness about the situation of Bahrein. H. R.H. then,as asked him as to with how many ships Bahrein can be retained. The respectable Syed was a politician and sa said in reply 'now it will be possible (to retain it) with one ship,but it will not be possible to do so, after a few years,with a hundred ships. The tour made by Lord Curzon, late G-ovr, G-enel. of India, in the Gulf 4 years ago,accompanied by a fleet of warships and ex traordinary ceremonies increased the greatness dignity and influence of the British Government at Bahrein and the Oman Sea as one to the thousand. But as regards the condition of the Persians residing at Bahrein,Ood knows what fate they have. Oppression and tyranny were and are exercised on them by the inhabitants and the local Gout to such an extent as it not used against any pagan in the World* Notwithstanding that the people of Bahrein are mostly Shiah. Ithna Asheri and caravans of Bahrein pilgrims proceed to Khorasan every year,yet the Government is so absolute and despotic that they have ordained a tax on every^Rowse-khani' meeting to be collected every year during the months of Moharrum and Saffer. Among the incidents of have lately be fallen the Persians residing in that place is that oi Ramazan 13^2 when the local Kazi,instigated by the members of the Government,passed a decree for their murder,plunder and expulsion. The Arabs made an at tack./O # tack did all wiiat/ they could, assaulted and wounded a number of persons,the rest closing their offices and shops for fear of their lives and taking refuge in houses. What could they do? They have no protector nor any means (of defence) Nor does any one ask what is the fault of these Mussalmans that their slaughter should be permitted and authorized. At last some of them,with a great deal of disappointment,thought that they had a protector. Suppose that the Persian (govern ment have,owing to their highmindedness,lost sight of the possession of Bahrein; but they cannot lose sight of the 4000 Persians,who are the children of the Shah and the trust of Allah. So they wired telegraphic com plaints, via Bushire,to His late Majesty;and some time after,an answer was received from the Mushir ed 'Oowleh Foreign Minister,which was nearly to this effecfyour telegram has been received and communications have been made with the British Minister who will take early measures to afford you redress' Though the re ceipt of this telegram promised safety and ease for those poor people to some extent,but,with deep dis appointment, they preferred murder to the receipt of this telegram because,in point of fact,this telegram of the Persian Foreign Minister .deprives Persia of her rights of possession of Bahrein and,on the contrary, confirms the influence of the English. By and by, the same thing happened,because,after some time,a British man o'war arrived at Bahrein with the Resident for Bushire on board;and he made inquiries and returned Bushire. It was not long afterward that a ileet of British ships visited the place and landed guns and soldiers who surrounded and plundered the house of Sheikh All bin Ahmed (one of the Sheikh's relatisms T and of his employe's and,in view of their politics, declared him to be guilty and expelled him to Bombay. It wasIt was arranged t/]ia't whatever happens in future between the Persians and Arabs the British representa tive should effect a settlement thereof as he does for their own subjects. So for some time they (the Persian, used to live better than before, but it is an admitted fact that wherever there are a number of people with out a protector they will be subjected to high-handed ness of others;and it is obvious that the representa tive of the British Oovernment will not have an hearty affection for tne Persians,but he will not care to sacrifice thousand of lives for the furtherance of his politics. My sole object in writing this letter and giving the above details is (to point out) that the situation has become too serious for the people of that place i.e.the Persians residing at Bahrein,and they say that if,in fact,the Persian •government has lost sight of . . . '/ their rights in the island,why lose sight ofthis group of subjects. For what reason should these illfated per sons remain captive and submissive to foreigners. Why do they not send a representative to those parts so that he may safeguard them. ( You should not suppose that this group of subjects mentioned by me are all coolies, sailors, labourers and have footed menof straw. No,most of them are from, among leading merchants and owners of pro perties and wealthy persons of name who,had they been pleased and encomaged,would have subscribed large sums to the National Bank and it was possible that the dear country and the fellow countrymen may receive mucn benefit from them ) And if they have not lost sight- of it,then what is meant by 'communication with British Minister'.'

In reply I informed him that the Persian Ardokunl resided in Bombay for 7 years and was at first a Munshi in the employ of a merchant named Kaji Muhammad Hassan Kashi in the Fort, and latterly kept a book seller 's shop in J Bhendi Bazaar until his departure for the Persian Gulf. He left Bombay having failed in business owing Soto 4 hundred rupees to different merchants. There was nothing against him in Bombay beyond the above.10 2. The Persian newspaper 'Majllis' of Tehran referred to is taken in by a few Persian^ merchants in Bombay. The last issue was received in Bombay at the end of June. The article mentioned is not in any of the issues received.

This and another anonymous accusation I received lately can, I think, be safely attributed to the jealousy and possibly personal spite of Yusuf Kanoo. How much basis of truth there may be for the accusa nt tions, it is impossible to say, and at is a very difficult question to investigate. There is at any rate obvio's malice. L Yusuf Kanoo is very bitter at having been excluded by Knox from the charge of all the more delicate and confidential political nego- I tiations of the Agency - a line of policy which I have seen good to maintain. Previously, as atfr as I can understand, he was a cons tant intermediary between the Agency and the Shekh in all important matters, and, unless I am misinformed, he used frequently to accomp- ^ any Mackenzie when he visited the Shekh. As we have no control over the man, nor means of knowing what exactly he may say or do, I personally regard such a course as highly dangerous. Again, as we can make him no return for the really considerable trouble which he puts himself to in such work, it is obvious that he must draw his reward in some indirect way. This can only be in dictating, or being popularly credited with dictating or strongly influencing, the action and policy of the Political Agent. I sun sorry for the man, who has apparently done much really good for us during many years, and who has some right to feel sore at being more or less cold-shouldered. But I can see no way out of it consonant with my independence and the dignity of Government. \ As regardsAs rea|grds the charges against Sofi: a matter of a month ago Yusuf Kanoo made the accusation to me verbally about the case of the horse, but his malice was so patent that I judged it unwise to attempt any action. I have not before heard of the smuggling business, I may possibly be able to find out in time. It is nonsense for people of the kind who have written this letter to say they have anything to fear from Sofi in regard to the treatment of their suits. It is also nonsense to say that my not talking Arabic properly has in the least altered Sofi f s position or knowledge. I know enough to understand all ordinary letters, I read all the Sheki^s letters my self and draft my own and check the translations; moreover Sofi has always written all Arabic letters issued. i tnkff Sytzr Someone has to know about the state of ordinary current questions discussed with the Shekh, and I prefer that it should be a person whom I can punish if I find that he is not acting loyally. I take Sofi with me when I see the Shekh, but I am able to understand practically everything that is said as they both speak easy Arabic, and I do as much of the talking as I can myself. As regards the Majlis questions: I have fairly good reason for believing that Yusuf Kanoo's hand was against us throughout that matter, probably in order to spite Knox, for whom he has not a good word to say, except in regard to his fluent Arabic. Yusuf Kanoo, after leaving me severly alone for a long time, has recently been on a new tack trying to cajole me with hospitality and petty presents of flowers etc. Our apparent relations are very cordial, and it is not my fault if they are not really so. The other anonymous note blamed Sofi for action which, as it happened, he was following my instructions which were contrary to what he had himself advised. Both communications have, I think, been typed on a machine in Messrs. Wonckhaus's office. We areI ■ lis V25 We are probably now in for a lot of trouble of this sort in one form or another, and I should like to know whether you approve my attitude to Yusuf Kanoo. He is an influential man, and we shall certainly have to reckon with him as a constant thorn in the flesh unless he is accorded the exact position he wants.MB Bf hrain, 2-4-12, / Dear Sir Psrcy, Fresh trouDie orevingi Recently one or the Arp-.o memberb or tUe Majlis sent in his resignation on the ple^ of being too ousy. Ire t erred it to Shekh Is?-. The Shekh has now- written to me spying that he has made enquiries,^.nd that the desire jto resign was not due to over-work out to discontentment at the •presidency or Mr Sofi. He filso enclosed a paper signed by the four Arab members of the Majlis in which they also ask to be excused from serving on the Majlis on the grounds that while they are responsible for t .e administration of justice Mr Sofi forces his views on them and treats them with discourtesy,and his object is solely to force them to agree to whf.t he w^nts.

Sof'i's tact may not be all it might De ,but he never gets exci -ted or losses his temper,and sonn&amp; pressure is douotless necessary to get tenable decisions out or the Majlis at all in many cases. In any case it is a.osurd for four men of position to say that they are not free agents. It is also open to any one to express k dissentient opinion in writing,and foreign members frequently do 30, out I cannot reca.ll a single note of dissent by an Arab. It is the old game of anti-Foreigners and anti-Agency,and has probably been engineered by a few of our special friends. The *i Immediate cause has probably been the Hindu claim against the ^ janding Agent. Orders by tfce Majlis for investigations to be maae vere resented by the L.A.and his powerful faction,who have probauly set to intimidating the Arab Members.

One of his informants was Sheikh Ali bin Muhammad Sheikh Hamad's brother- one of the three to whom you spoke about the latter's con duct on 36th August 1910. Sheikh Isa said that relations between himself and the 3 other brothers were excellent / but that Sheikh Hamad was sulky and never came to see him nor paid him any courtesies. 3. I was careful to try and act in accordance with the spirit of your letter above referred to.. I urged Sheikh Isa to try and keep a watch on Sheikh Hamad's movements and head him off from a pilgri mage to Basra. If he did escape, I thought the Sheikh would find means of dealing with his misconduct, and I thought that the Turks would soon find they had no use forfor an empty and absorbent spnge. In answer to enquiry Sheikh Isa said that he had no direct oommunication with Hamad..

I 'also said that if he liked he might add that further cor respondence on the subject should be addressed to me. This rather moved the Sheikh who replied his Treaty with us did not bind him except in regard to Political correspondence, that he was free to carry on private correspondence of a friendl5 r nature with any one, and that in this case there was nothing political. I replied that I agreed with him that so long as the Turkish Authorities did not insist on the extradition of the man the affair might be considered as a private one, and that I had only made a suggestion and left it perfectly free to him to take it or not. 2. It is true that a question of the nature oi the present one might become a political one at any moment, but until it does not actually become one, itit seerns inexpedient to put pressure on the Sheikh who is sensitive of his independence.

To ensure the maximum chance of their acceptance I broached the subject carefully before we had touched on any other contentious matter. Sheikh Isa however would not listen to either of your first two alternatives. He at once got on his high horse as independent 'Ruler of Bahrein. He quoted old cases going back to 30 years ago in which the Turks had returned absconding offenders to him. His attitude throughout was that his dignity as a Ruler would be destroyed by his consenting to our dealing with a matter of this sort for him. Finally seeing that his mind was closed on the subject, I communicated your third choice to him, which he accepted. 3. I am given to underataaid that the people whom it is desired to extradite, ha.ve not been found m B3.hrein. I impressed on the Sheikh that on no account should he on his own authority hand over any of them who might fall to his hands. He promised not to, but I do not feel entire confidence in him, as he persists inmm / L &lt; ^ o In regarding ua aa -trying unduly tu interfere in what 7^ he maintains are surely his own affaire.

You will also remember that you addressed a few words to Sheikh la a on the subject on 14th June 1912. * 2. I now enclose copies of these two letters to complete 3 r our records . 3. I also send a copy and translation of a further letter which Sheikh laa has just received from the same source, and which he has today sent for my in spection. You will observe that the tone of thia let ter is approaching the peremptory, and further that the Wall has deputed the Hasa-Nejd Postal Contractor to act m the matter as a sort of diplomatic, if not- executive, agent. The Sheikh's Secretary who brought me the letter, told me that Sheikh laa had received It b3^ the hand of Abdur Rahim, the Postal Contractor, but that he had not discussed the question m any way with the latter.4, It doe a not aeem much uae to continue to tender advice to Sheikh. la a which he will not accept and which we are not prepared to force on him; but I ahall, aa before, adviae him to pay no attention to the let ter, and absolutely to avoid holding any communication with the Turkish Postal Contractor on the subject.

He also produced a Busreh Newspaper containing an article on the subject of Sheikh Hamad 's claims.

Correspondence has passed between the High Wllayat and the Sheikh of Bahrein, Isa A1 Khalifah, about^secjond refusal of the latter to recognise the rights of his cousin Hamad A1 Khalifah In the inheritance of his father who was Sheikh of Bahrein, (Sheikh Isa) alleg ing that the custom of their ancestors requires that the possessor of power and authorit3 7 ' should be dis tinguished from the (other members of the ) family by (the right of) appropriating all the remaining pro perty; and as an act of generosity on his part he-|the isolated one}-may grant them what will save them from the disgrace of begging!- and that,verily, he (Sheikh Isa.) did whatever seemed necessary and had given them what had seemed good to him! But these deceptions and fallacies could not find acceptance with His Excellency the Wali of the Wilayat* and he therefore issued his generous order for the despatch of a trustworthy person who should enquire into the matter minutely and reduce the extent of the disagreement between the parties. He has strongly charged Sheikh Isa to do justice to his cousin and to terminate dispute and discord. We regret to see to what a state some leaders and persons of authority have been brought by their tyranny and pride and their adherence to the skirts of falsehood.

RESIDENT, Persian Gulf, telegraphs to following effect:— ' There is a troublesome person called Sheikh Hamid-bin-Mohammed-bin-Khalifa, a first cousin of the Sheikh of Bahrein, who is always disaffected against the sheikh and discontented with his allowances. Vali of Bussorah wrote to Sheikh of Bahrein last April, stating that appeal had been made to Turkish Government by Hamid, now in Bussorah, for restitution to him of his patrimony, which he alleged that Sheikh Esa had usurped. Sheikh's compliance was requested by vali. Political agent advised sheikh to refer to me before replying, but sheikh declined to wait, and wrote a letter informing vali that Hamid's statements were untrue. Further letter in peremptory terms has now been received by sheikh from vali saying that latter has no doubt that claims of llamid are just, and that Abdur Rahim is being sent to negotiate with Sheikh Esa for a settlement. (Abdur Rahim is the person who acts as agent for the Hasa post at Bahrein.) Vali's letter was accepted by sheikh from Abdur Rahim's hand, but he has sent no reply to it, and refused to discuss question. Request is now made by sheikh that necessary action may be taken by us. Sir G. Lowther may, I trust, be authorised to take exception to action of vali in using as political medium the so-called postal agent and in taking up intriguer's case, and to request thatj instructions to desist may be sent to vali by telegraph.' We trust that representations may be made to Turkish Government, unless it is inconvenient in view of present negotiations that question of Bahrein should be dragged into prominence over this petty matter. We propose to instruct political agent at the same time that a warning should be conveyed to sheikh of impropriety of his action in replying to vali. and that further correspondence on his part in contravention of his agreement of 1892 should be strictly forbidden.

It is not hidden from me that it is duly prescribed in your agreement * with the British Government of 22nd Decem- her 1880 that the engagement ' does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.' But I cannot agree that the phenomenon of one of the Al Khalifah family taking refuge with the Sublime Porte against your treatment of him was a ' business of minor importance.' I am aware of your good intentions and that your wish to reply to the Vali of Basrah's communications was due only to a desire to be courteous, but in this case, in my opinion, you should have realised that the matter was important and that even if some little delay was entailed, you would have been wiser not to reply until you received advice as to the most suitable terms for such replv. In conclusion, I must ask Your Honour that—as is necessary owing to the exigencies of the times—you will be very cautious in future in your own interests and will place a more strict interpretation on your treaty eno-ao-ements with the British Government in this matter. 988 F.
