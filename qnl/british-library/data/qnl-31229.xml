William Bruce encloses a copy of the original order, dated 30 March 1814, from His Excellency Sir Gore Ouseley, for twelve pairs of Kerman goats. Bruce gives details of how twenty goats were procured, courtesy of Abraham Khan, Governor of the Province of Kerman [KermƒÅn], and were initially sent to Sheraz [Shiraz]. Bruce reports that seventeen goats have recently arrived at Bushire (three died in transit), and that he will forward them to the Presidency at the first eligible opportunity. Bruce suggests that Abraham Khan be rewarded by the Company for his efforts.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711593.0x0000eb#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
