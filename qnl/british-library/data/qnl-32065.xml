ElCL03 : I am to enclose for your information copy of a letter dated 8th of July which has been addressed to the Treasur:/ on this subject, which explains the reasons for the attitude adopted by this Department, and to say that it is not proposed to modify the suggestion conveyed in the let:er to your Department of the 26th ultimo that the 497 bales of Basra wool should be shioped to the United Kingdom in the usual manner. The Under Secretary of State Political Department, In. ia Office, S.W. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant,124/Wool/99(R.U.l.a) 8th July, 1918. Sir, O : o 1. I am commanded by the Army Council to refer to your letter of the 26th instant (Uo. 24,936/l8), enclosing a copy of a minute from the Commission Internationale de Havitaille- ment on the subject o/ the direct purchase of Bagdad wool by France. I am to explain that under arrangements which have been.made between the Army Council and the Secretary of State for India, ^a.edad wool is purchased at a fixed basis of orice, and is shipped to Great Britain for distribution through the usual channels of the Trade. 2. Requests have been made by the Governments of France )) and the United States that they should be allowed to purchase /f this wool direct and to ship it to the respective countries. In view however, of the fact that such purchases would naturally create competition, and tend to drive the price paid for the wool beyond that fixed by consultation between the Army Council and the Secretary of State for India, the Army Council was unable to agree to this course, and instead arranged with the Secretary of State for India that all applications for the export of wool from Basra should be referred to the Army Council and that the Commission Internationale de Eavitaille- ment should obtain from the Army Council their military require ments of Bersian wool on exactly the same parity as British raanufacturers. 3. In view of the fact that it came to the knowledge of /the Army Council that a shipment of wool pickings was being made from Basra to Marseilles by Alexandria, the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement were asked to impress upon the French Delegation that such transactions were calculated seriously to interfere with the British Control of Persian wwol, owing to their tendency to increase prices. 4. Under these sircumstances, therefore, the Army Council do not feel disposed to agree to the request of the French Delegation that- the shipment of 497 bales at present at, Bombay should be allowed to proceed, but consider instead that' applications for French military requirements for this wool should be made through the Usual channels.

As regards the particular consignment of wool to which the minute refers, I am to say that Government of India telegraphed on the 19th June enquiring whether export to Marseilles should be permitted. The matter was referred to the War Office, who replied on the 26th Juney' that the consignment could not be released for shipment to France, but should be forwarded to the United Kingdom in the usual manner. Before instructing the Government of India in this sense,sense, Mr. Secretary Montagu is enquiring of the War Office whether the circumstances reported in your letter under reply afford any grounds for a modification of their decision. I am to add that Mr. Montagu regards the question of the erpori^ of wool from Mesopotamia as one in which the War Office are primarily concerned; and he would suggest that ahy further communications on the subject should be addressed to that Department. a copy of the correspondence is being communicated to the Foreign Office.f ■^rr.

It is presumed that the 1,000 bales mentioned in the firm’s letter were not included in the 8,200 cubic feet of baled wool stated in your telegram of the 4th August, Ho.5540, to be awaiting shipment at Basra. But it seems a question whether, if there is no local objection, Messrs. Gulbenkian’s consignment should not obtain the benefit of any arrangements which may be made by the Shipping Controller for the provision of freight for the export of wool from Mesopotamia to the United Kingdom. As you are aware, the Secretary of State is in communication with the Ministry of Shipping on this matter.DRAFT LETTER. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL S.W.l. The Secretary, Ministry ofr Shipping. r * 2 ^August, 1917. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 16th August, 1917, regarding the shipment of wool from Basra to the United Kingdom, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose, for the information of the Shipping Controller, copy of further corres pondence with the Director of Annjt Contracts on the subject. Having regard to the view expressed in the last paragraph of the War Office letter of the 21st August, the Secretary af“ State does not consider that the first alternative suggested in your letter under reply, viz:- sale to the Italian Government, would afford a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. With regard to the r 2nd alternative, he agrees that the wool may be stored pending the allocation of a steamer to carry dates or some other commodity to the United Kingdom; but he would observe that, as the consignments of dates under purchase by the '.Jar Office to be shipped, not to this country arecountry but to Marseilles and other . Mediterranean ports, the shipment of the,wool with one of these consign ments would not secure the objects desired by the Director of Army Contracts, viz:- delivery of the material in the United Kingdom. It is possible, however, that the question of the direct shipment of dates from Basra to British ports may shortly ^ arise, as the Food Controller has ' recently made enquiries as to the possibility of purchasing the fruit through the Chief Political Officer, Mesopotamia, for consumption in the United Kingdom. In the meantime Mr. Montagu trusts that^case of the 8200 cubic feet of baled wool, to which the present correspondence relates, will be borne in mind, and thqt arrangements will be made, as soon as circumstances permit, to provide the necessary freight for its transposition to England via the Cape.

Sir, Referring to the letter from the Ministry of Shipping of August 16th and the India Office letter of August 20th, I am directed to reply as follows. The wool cannot be handed over to an Allied country at Suez or Marseilles without being placed on show at the Port of arrival, properly catalogued by wool brokers, and examined and re-valued by special experts sent from this Department. It is therefore impossible to take delivery at Suez, but is possible at Marseilles. This Department would, however, prefer the risk of some delay, if by so doing it would insure the wool being shipped to this country, as we shall need all this class of wool for our own military requirements.
