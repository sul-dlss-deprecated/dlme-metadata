Previous papers : It seems probable that the Conservancy Board scheme is shortly to be revived owing to ! increasing difficulties arising out of the activities of the Persian liavy in the Shatt-al- : Arab and the Hooka Channel (see pp.in attached file, P*2•4912/33 etc,). The Iraq Govt.have lately renewed their interest in the proposed Convention and Sir F*Humphrys has given them an Arabic translation of the draft in its latest form. This draft will be found at P.Z.887/33 below. This Office is directly interested only in the last paragraph of Article IV(Flag E) regarding the management by the Board of the Persian/ 1743 1000 3.33Persian Gulf Lights. It will be remembered that we have lately felt somewmat apprehensive about this last proposal owing to the employment by the Persian Government of foreign lighting experts and the consequent danger that it might lead to foreign interference with the lights on the Arab Coast. However, even if the Convention materialises, it will be necessary to come to some definite arrangement with the Board before the Lighting System in the Gulf, at present administered by the Basra Port authorities, is actually handed over to them and it might, if necessary, be possible to arrange for the Ai*ab Lights to be managed by a sub-Committee without a Persian representative (Sir H.Biscoe 1 s TT double-decker ,T scheme). At any rate it seems best for the present to mark time and see whether the Conservancy Board scheme is actually adopted. If the Convention is concluded it will be difficult to find any other agency than the Board to administer the Gulf Lights since the functions of the Basra Port authorities will be merged in the new Board. (Sd.) G.E.Crombie, 12.3.34. I agree that we should for the present continue to mark time: there is likely to be a good deal more discussion both in Persia and Iraq before any decision is probable• J.G.L., 12.3.34./ In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. £ b ,- ' ‘ H and address —not to any person, uy “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreigr ion on this subject, please quote /f-Vy f/y / person by name, but \fi— ' e,” Foreign/Office, London, S.W. i.

HIS Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note sent to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated the 15th July, on the subject of the arrest and detention of Captain J. Macleod by the Persian naval authorities. Tehran, July 15, 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Mallet to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. le Ministre, (Jultiek, July io, i\)66. I HAVE the honour, under instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to address your Highness on the subject of the recent detention at Mohammerah by the Persian naval authorities oi Captain J. Macleod, a British subject, employed by the Basra Pbrt Trust as harbour-master at Abadan Reach. . . . 2. Your Highness is already, I believe, well acquainted with tim cncum- stances of this case, and I need only mention that at abmm 8 o cIock ] n ' 16 morning of the 23rd June (the 2nd Tyr, 1312) Captain Macleod proceeded on board the gunboat Palang, of the Imperial Persian navy, which was then lying m mid-stream at Abadan Reach, in order to offer his assistance in berthing the Palana at No 7 ietty at Abadan. No senior officer was available at that hour, but a iunior officer told him that the vessel would not be ready to move for another two hours. Captain Macleod accordingly arranged, without any objection fiom thp nffiocr to return at 8 o’clock. ' , 3 At about 7 o’clock, however, Captain Macleod saw that Aie PaJang was i j ■ rr frvrariivrk Yn 7 iettv and thinking that there had been some ssstsayras- at tw &gt;». * « T misunaerstanaing, seamen on the deck made an indistinct signal which Palang one oj * 6 “ “him in the launch thought was a warning to Captain Macleod and t . iTp armrdino’lv came alongside about amidships on keep clear of the . of the launch, a method the river side and b ° ard ed th « the senior nava l officer, who said he frequently 'but would speak to him later. Captain Macleod was busy at that mome , wat 4 e d the completion of the berthing of accordingly went to the bndg a norlnal fashion. The operation being the vessel, which was proceea g i h but t0 his surprise was stopped completed, he ^/he was told that he must proceed under arrest to by a sentry.

Sir John Simon has accordingly instructed me to protest against it s unwarrantable treatment of a British subject by the senior naval officer o e Imperial navy. Captain Macleod was merely doing what he rightly conceived to be his duty under the Port of Basra Regulations, and was acting in t .e interests of the safety both of Persian and foreign shipping. His detention at Mohammerah for a week was an arbitrary and highly improper action, against which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are constrained to register the strongest protest. 6. His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction the prompt recognition of the error which had been committed, when once the matter had been brought to the notice of the Imperial Government at Tehran, resulting in the release from detention of Captain Macleod, as well as the courtesy with which he was treated while the detention lasted, but they must ask that stringent orders may be issued to the Persian naval authorities with a view to avoid the occurrence of any further such incidents. 7. From the above your Highness will recognise that His Majesty’s Govern ment are concerned wdth the fact that the arrested person was a British subject. The fact of his employment under the Government of Iraq and the relations of the Basra Port Trust with the Imperial navy are matters which concern the Government of Iraq, regarding which I understand your Highness has already received representations.

Section 2. /at Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received Auqust 1.) (No. 357.) • 7 ^ r ’ TxrrrnTT - Gulhek, July 15, 1933. WllH reference to your telegram No. 109 of the 7th July, I have the honour to state that in the course of conversation 'fo^Jay with the Minister for Foreign Affairs T mentioned, among other matters of which I had occasion to complain to iJis Highness, the case of Captain Macleod. I said that I had addressed a note of protest to him which would probably reach him to-day and that I would not, there fore, weary him with the details. My concern was mainly that a British subject had been treated in such an extraordinary way by the Persian navy. 2. Feroughi started a long and rambling dissertation about Persian pre tensions to the Shatt-el-Arab. I told him that I was not here to discuss that question to-day, as it mainly concerned Iraq. What worried me was that here was another ‘instance of interference with a British subject who was merely carrying out his ordinary duties and I hoped that the Persian naval officers would be warned to be more careful in future. I recognised that prompt action by his Highness had prevented the incident from developing more unpleasantly. 3. The Minister could not, however, be stopped from pouring out to me his complaints against the Iraqi Government. There was the question of the water way ; there was also the question of the Kurdish frontier, where incidents were of frequent occurrence. Brigands and lawless Kurds were frequently dodging Persian justice by slipping over the frontier, and then, I gathered, engaging in nefarious intrigues against Persia. I said that luckily this was the affair of the Iraqi Government and not ours, but I wondered why it was that the Persian military authorities did not prevent these brigands from leaving Persia. As regards the Shatt-el-Arab, I was careful to avoid being drawn into any discussion. I merely remarked that I understood that Sir Francis Humphrys had gone carefully into all these frontier questions when he visited Tehran, and I wondered why there had been no progress since. Feroughi expressed his intense admiration for Sir Francis, but expressed a fear that in the changed circumstances of Iraq his Excellency was no longer in a position to bring as much influence to bear as formerly. I told his Highness that I thought that His Majesty’s Ambassador’s influence was still very strong, though now exercised in another way. In view of your instructions I went no further, though it would have been easy to mention the question of the Tripartite Conservancy Board. I gathered that Feroughi had been having rather heated interviews with the Iraqi Minister, who is probably not paving the way towards such an agreement. 4. As I was armed with several other complaints I then led the conversation via the interference by the Persian navy with Koweit dhows to the general system of pinpricks which still seemed to prevail in spite of all his Highness’s assurances of goodwill I gave several instances, and told him frankly that I was sad and disappointed that our efforts should be thwarted by the stupidity and insolence of minor officials of the police, military, naval and customs forces. Life was none too pleasant in such circumstances, and wherever I went 1 heard nothing bu grumbling I was never allowed to meet Persians and they never dared visit me for fear of the fate of Rashidi. I was forced to associate entirely with diplomats and members of the foreign community, and I had never before lived m such an atmosphere of discontent. I ventured to tell his Highness that the whole Dinlomatic Corps seemed to be seething with annoyance, and only living foi the dav when they could depart from Persia. I myself liked living in this country, but it made me miserable to live among people who did nothing but grumble. His H ighness was so good as to take my deliberate outburst m excellent part, and • /i fi?AYPnsp himself as usual with talk about the wickedness of the northern tried to excuse him id &lt;&lt; that have terrible difficulties with RuSaTnd trouble wRh Daq. and then you allow your petty officials to continue-^r. to upset relations with Great Britain, with whom you have, on youi own admission, no quarrel whatever.” Feroughi protested, as he always does the sincerest friendship, and his personal cordiality towards me aitei my outspoken ness to him was even warmer than usual. I am not, however, vain enough to believe that my words will have the slightest effect. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the horeign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad (No. 5/). I have, &amp;c. V. A. L.

WxlH reference to your despatch Vx 418 of the 28th June, regarding the unsatisfactory attitude of the Persian navaT' authorities towards the port authority at Basra, I transmit to you the accompanying copy of a memorandum from the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the same subject. 2. On the 20th July Nuri Pasha called here and discussed the question at considerable length. He was informed that His Majesty’s Government had heard of the difficulties caused by the Persian warships in the Shatt-el-Arab, and that they realised the dangers to which the Iraqi memorandum called attention. At the same time, the situation in the Shatt-el-Arab was unsatisfactory. The Persians had a certain grievance in the fact that they had no voice in the manage ment of a waterway which, though not so vital to Persia as to Iraq, did, neverthe less, lead to important Persian ports. This had been recognised when the Persians first started pressing their claim for a revision of the frontier, and the proposed convention for a Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board had then been devised not only as a means of providing for the safety and better administration of the waterway, but also as a means of giving the Persians a certain measure of satisfaction without in any way impairing Iraq’s legitimate rights. It seemed, therefore, that the best way to-deal with the difficulties which were now arising would be for the Iraqi Government to take up the whole question officially with the Persian Government without further delay; to point out to them the serious difficulties and dangers which were being caused by the behaviour of the Persian ships; to explain that Iraq fully understood Persia’s desire to have a voice in the control of this important waterway; and formally to propose that the whole question should now be disposed of, to the best interest of all concerned, by the negotiation, as soon as possible, of a Conservancy Board Convention on the lines of the draft which had already been unofficially communicated to the Persian Government last year. . 3. Nuri Pasha replied that in his opinion the Persians were bent on securing something much more far-reaching than this. They had ne\ei abandoned their claim for a revision of the frontier in the Shatt. To propose that the matter should be dealt with by the conclusion of the Conservancy Board Convention would be unlikely to satisfy them. They would probably refuse the proposal, and what was to be done then ? , . T • n 4. It was explained in reply that, even if this occurred, the Iraqi Govern ment would be no worse off than they were now. His Majesty s Goveinment understood (and Nuri Pasha confirmed this impression) that the Iraqi Lovern- ment were determined not to yield on the question of the revision of the frontier. If this was so, the Iraqis would, it seemed reasonable to conclude, much impiove their diplomatic position vis-a-vis the Persians by putting forward an alternative nronosal which would meet the reasonable desire of the I ersians to have a voice Fn the control of the waterway and which would obviously be to the interests of both “ties if such a proposal were formally put forward with a view to rFmedvhm a’situation which was unsatisfactory, and the Persians were to refuse it their uosition would be considerably weakened, and they might well lose a great deal of sympathy which they might acquire if their representations were merely ^^idwatiOMdt was, fo? purely material and physical reasons, doable that an ^to ™ the inclusion oftoe Conservancy Board Convention a l f the g hat( either silting ^ - *&gt;» K— *** [859 cc—1]2 uncontrolled in flood time and of * e to pXTde^'or ^he effectiTe no steps were taken within a reasonab t j ie Karun, both Iraq and international control of the waters o Government also had a material Persia might suffer seriously.

I had already, before the receipt of Nun 1 asha s memorandum, been considering the question whether action should be taken by His Majesty s Govein- ment with the Persian Government regarding the behaviour of the Persian warships in the Shatt-el-Arab, and Sir Francis Humphrys and Colonel Ward have been consulted on the point. As at present advised, I contemplate instructing His Majesty’s Charge d J Affaires at Tehran to address to the Persian Government friendly representations based on the risk involved of serious damage to British interests,' including those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, if such proceedings continue. I propose, however, first to await the report from Mr. Mallet, requested in my telegram No. 109 of the 7th July to him (repeated to you as No. 123), regarding the results oF the representations which the Iraqi Minister at Tehran is understood to have made to the Persian Government on this subject, in connexion with the recent arrest of Captain MacLeod.

Copies of these documents have many times been sent to the Persian Government. Fiom the incidents which repeatedly occur, it appears that Persian ships do not intend to obey these regulations and instructions when passing through Iraqi waters, and that they desire in this way to raise the question of the frontier in the Shatt-el-Arab. I he Iraqi Government consider these acts to be a violation of Iraqi territory and an infringement of Iraqi sovereignty in this area. They consequently find themselves confronted with a dispute in their foreign affairs, the outcome of which may be of great importance. In accordance with the treaty existing between us, we desire to bring this serious state of affairs to the notice of His Majesty’s Government in order to consult with them as to the steps which should be taken regarding these Persian transgressions. NURI-AL-SAID. Minister for Foreign Affairs. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Copy of a Report presented by the Director-General of the Port of Basrah. THE ships of the Persian navy, since their arrival in Iraq waters, have always disregarded the Basra Port Rules and Regulations. According to these rules, all vessels, without exception, when about to enter the Rooka Channel, which is only a one-way channel, must first obtain permission from the control officer, either through the pilot master on the pilot vessel, if entering the port, or Port Officer, Abadan, or Basra, if leaving the port. I his the ships of the Persian navy have refused to do, and, by the disregard of these very important regulations, collision with the dredgers at work in the channel have, on moie t an one occasion, only been very narrowly averted, and it is particularly dangerous during dust storms. , ... , , These vessels also manoeuvre within the harbour limits, Abadan Reach, at will and they avoid taking a harbour master on every possible occasion, and are frequently a danger to other craft. They also anchor m the fairway m such a wav as to restrict the movements of vessels. . . , ^ ^ Recently before dry docking, one of the sloops m the Anglo-Pei sian C Company’s dry dock, which is moored in the Shatt-el-Arab close to the Iraq bank commenced to discharge her ammunition practically within the danger zone limit’s, and only shifted her berth at the request of Pie port officer aftei a great Hpal of orotesting on the part of the commanding officei. , , , d nnrW the last week in June, Captain MacLeod, one of the port s harbour ^ 11 ’ °\i a boarded one of the Persian sloops as usual to advise masters at Aba^n ^ach, boated of Ure jetty when about and assist if nec y^J ^ ^ wag placed under arre st, and was sent to to leave the ship, , d nd b gpt in confinement for seven days.

Sir, The incident reported in my telegram No. 146 of June 26th affords me an opportunity for 'bringing to your notice the unsatisfactory attitude of the Persian Naval Commanders towards the Port Authority at Basra. 2. As you are aware, there is, at the entrance to the Shatt-al«*Arab, a deep water channel (the Rooka) constructed and kept dredged at great expense by the Basra Port Director ate. This channel is wide enough to allow of the passage of only one ship at a time, and there are controls at the ends to ensure that this is done. Ever since the arrival of the new Persian sloops, however, their commanders, although well aware of the regulations governing navigation in the dredged channel and in spite of frequent protests by the Port author ities, have consistently ignored the signals of the control •boat. They pass through the channel at high speeds, irrespective of whether or not other vessels happen to have right of way, and in a manner which suggests a total lack ot responsibility or a knowledge of the rudiments of seamanship. This behaviour on their part has more than once caused an unwarranted interruption in the dredging operations which, especially during the flood season, are vitally necessary to »h, channel W™. Indeed, It hn. happened mat onl, the prompt action of the «&lt;■ *»« averted a collision. 3 . ? i g Ut Honourable.^ K . c . v .0., Lr John Simon, etc# etc., eliC * 93* Their conduct is the more reprehensible when it is remembered that a great part of the shipping using the channel consists of Anglo-Persian Oil Company tankers filled to the brim, on the homeward journey, with highly inflammable material* In these circumstances, the danger of collision or grounding in the Channel is such as to cause the Port Directorate continual anxiety, and their concern is by no means diminished by the behaviour of the Persian war vessels when they cross the Pao bar and enter the Shatt. 4. Reports which have reached me privately from Colonel Ward show beyond doubt that the unseamanlike manner in which the Persian sloops are handled constitutes a very real danger to shipping in the river, and that though the commanders are averse, on principle, from availing themselves of a harbour master’s services, they are only too glad to do so when their own inexperience lands them in difficulties* This applies particularly to their activities in the Abadan Reach, and the following examples will serve to show that the preoccupation of the Port Authority is far from groundless. 5. On June 10th last, the Persian sloop ,l Simorgh ,, arrived in the harbour at Abadan from Mohammerah without signalling her time of arrival and without requesting the services of the harbour master. After a series of inexplicable manoeuvres, in the course of which the lower part of the harbour was circumnavigated no less than three times, the vessel finally passed outside the mooring buoys and rounded into the fairway, in the centre of which she anchored until removed by the harbour master. These Persian antics not only delayed the departure of 8 . 8 . 'Gorgistan' of the Stride line, but also involved an unnecessary and dangerous turn in the strong ebb which was running at the time. The 'Simorgh' again got into trouble on 19 th. » that aha .hould h= tranafar-.d from3 from the Workshop Jetty at Abadan to No* 7 berth to allow of the berthing of the sloop ’'Karkas”, which was then undocking. A harbour master was despatched to carry out the movement, but before he arrived the 'Siraorgh” had cast off and was endeavouring to shift her berth without using her engines, in spite of a high shamal (north wind) and strong ebb. By the time the harbour master arrived she was in a precarious position and only his prompt action prevented her from grounding and sustaining great damage. On another occasion the firm attitude of the harbour master prevented two of the Persian sloops from shifting ammunition in close proximity to the Abadan refunery and well within the harbour limits. 6. The records of the Port Directorate show that on no less than thirteen occasions since April 1st last the move ments of Persian war vessels have been actually carried out by the harbour master at Abadan Reach, notwithstanding that, for what are called /’political’ 1 reasons, their services are never requested t&gt;y the Persians and in spite of the fact that in the case of war vessels their services are given free of charge. 7. I am satisfied that it is only the anxiety of the Port authorities to guard against the danger of serious accident in the Shatt and the Hooka Channel that prompts their solicitude in regard to these Persian sloops. In these circumstances, the arrest of Captain MacLeod is a matter calling for strong protest and the support of His Majesty’s ChargS d’Affaires at Tehran for such steps as may he taken by his ’Iraqi colleague to secure the harbour master's immediate and unconditional release.

I have just received from Colonel Ward Captain MacLeod’s own report of the incident,^ together with a report of an interview with him after his arrest hy Captain Shoosmith the Port Officer at Basrah. Copies of these are enclosed herewith. It will be seen that Captain MacLeod had, in the ordinary course of his duties and in accordance with the Basrah Port Regulations, hoarded the vessel at &amp; a.m. on June 23rd to advise the Captain regarding berthing. At that hour he found no responsible officer on duty. He ascertained, however, that the ship would not be ready to move for two hours. When, in the interim, he learned that the ship was actually under way, he followed and boarded her in accordance with what he understood to be the arrangement made a short while previously. No objection was raised by the officeron duty and the only signal he received was a dumb show on the part of a sailor which he interpreted as meaning a warning to keep away from the propeller. In the circumstances his arrest seems to have been in the nature of an afterthought and in any case to be due to a complete misunderstanding. I would add that Captain MacLeod’s version of ^he ax fair is completely borne out by the statements of his boat's crew.■wjMiuuiHMaumuuiMnwiB ujiHuujumiuiim COPY Bagg^.g, 418 of zbm/z^ n mo 29th Safar 1552. 23rd June,1933.

At 1630 I received instructions that the vessel required a Harbour Master to unberth. On boarding I was informed that the vessel was awaiting orders from Mohammerah, and might be another hour alongside. At approximately 1745 I again went to No. 13 Jetty and the First Lieutenant informed me that he had just telephoned for a Harbour Master. I then waited on the vessel until 1818 list the engines were being got ready. At 1818 I went on the bridge with the Captain and with e permission unberthed the vessel.

Submitted. The following particulars are forwarded for information concerning the movements of the above vessel. On 20th June information was received by telephone from the Anglo Persian Oil Co. Ltd., Shipping Dept., to the effect that the ^’Ralang*’ was due in the harbour at daylight 21st and that she would berth at No. 13 Jetty Bawarda at 0630. The vessel arrived off Harmaq. at 1237 and a Harbour Master immediately proceeded alongside in the customary manner to proffer his services. The gangway was lowered and he was given every facility to board. On arrival on the vessel’s navigating bridge he asked the Commanding Officer if he should berth her and was informed that he (the Commanding Officer) preferred to carry out the movement himself. He thereupon stood-by on the bridge until the vessel was berthed, preferring advice based upon his local knowledge of the wind and tide, and which was acted upon. At 1630 information was received by telephone from the Tanker Loading Officer indicating that the Paiarg had completed bunkering and was presumably ready to unberth. Harbour Master proceeded on board and was informed on arrival tha^th^vessel would remain alongside pending orders from Mohammerah but that he would he telephoned for when required. At approximately 1745 the Harbour Master again proceeded to the vessel, in the meanwnile a telephone message having been received from the First Lieutenant requesting nis services. The vessel was unberthed by the Harbour Master at 1818 and anchored by him in No.l berth Bawarda at 1840. Informal! on was subsequently received from the Anglo Persian Oil Go. that the Palang would require to berth at No. 7 jetty a.m. 23rd when the British Architect had unberthed, in order to complete with 5 tons of Light Diesel Oil which commodity had not been available at No. 13 jetty. Harbour Masters were advised accordingly. At 2007 I left up for Basrah in M.L. Patsy on a duty visit, having handed over the duties of Asst. Port Officer in a regular manner by Memo, to Harbour Master McLeod. The following information has been obtained from Harbour Masters M.L. Sukhany, and from the records of snip and launch move ments maintained at this establishment. At 0530 23rd June Harbour Master McLeod proceeded to H.P.M.S.Palang and on return at 0555 is reported to nave stated that the vessel would he ready to proceed to No. 7 jetty at 0800. At 0632 the Palang weighed anchor and proceeded up harbour and at 0535 the Harbour Master left up presumably to board her. Owing to the disparity in speeds between the Palang and the motor boat, the former vessel had arrived off No. 7 jetty and was passing her head rope ashore when the Harbour Master arrived alongside. He boarded her from the off side apparently without any opposition and proceeded to the/25 2 the navigating bridge# He was detained on board and was later reported to have left at about 1100 for Mohammerah under arrest. The Palang unberthed from No. 7 jetty at 1310 and proceeded seaward. (Signed) C.J. POX. ASSISTANT PORT OFFICER.COPY i Enclosure in Bagdad Desr yif.^h. Enclosure 3&gt; Mohanmerah, 25th June 1933.

Time being about 7.00 a.m. The vessel was approaching No. 7 when I overtook her I boarded from the off side by stepping from the launch. I then went up to the Navigating Bridge. They were preparing to turn their head rope but had the After Back spring passed ashore when I arrived there at 7.35 a.m. while boarding launch to depart I was requested to wait as the Senior Officer wanted to speak to me.

In accordance with your instructions I proceeded to Abadan today to interview Harbour Master McLeod if the Persian Authorities would allow me to do so. On arrival at Abadan about 0830 I went to the Persian Passport Authorities for permission to go to Mohammerah. Permission was granted. I then proceeded to 'Hannaq' to meet Mr. Watkinson H.B.M’s Consul from Ahwaz who had obtained permission from the Governor General of Ahwaz to interview Hartour Master McLeod. He informed me that as regards the political side of Mr. McLeod's arrest he could do nothing but all he was concerned with was the protection ox his own Nationals and to see that Mr. McLeod was being lockea after properly. The Asst. Port Officer Abadan informed me that Mr. McLeod had been supplied with a suit-case lull of his clothes and wnieh had been forwarded to him through the Customs at Abadan transport being supplied by Anglo- Persian Oil Go. Mr. WatKinson informed me that he had arranged to meet Captain Bayonder, the Senior Persian Naval Officer then at Mohammerah, at 1300 today and I arranged to go with him. We first proceeded to the A.P.O.C. Shipping Office at Abadan and I had some conversation with the Shipping Manager. He infold me confidentially that he had heard that the Persian Naval Authorities intended to use the -Arab/Shatt-al-Arab river as they liked and to interfere with movements of shipping at Abadan as much as possible except A*P«0#C* Tankers* Apparently they mean vessels passing through, but calling at Abadan en route for Basrah such as the B*I* Mail Boats, Stricks snips, etc* By interfering I imagine they mean anchoring in the fairway there so as to either block the Channel altogether or to make it difficult for vessels to be berthed and unberthed and turned by anchoring near them in the manner that Messrs* Stricks ship ’’G-orjistan' was held up some time ago. From the Shipping Office the Consul and I went to see the General Manager. Just as we were leaving the Shipping Office the Shipping Manager informed me that Capt* Bayendor would be calling on him during the morning. I arranged with him to see Capt* Bayendor and to ask him permission to see Harbour Master McLeod* I saw this Officer later and he gave me the required permission without any objection. Mr. Watkinson later informed me that he had then arranged to call on Capt* Bayendor at 1700 hours today instead of 1300 hours* The Consul then took me in his car to Mohammerah, where he left me and X proceeded to the Nava: Barracks in his launch to see Harbour Master McLeod accom panied hy the British Consul's Interpreter. On my arrival at the Barracks, there were no Persian Naval Officer there, and all the offices were closed, hut an armed sentry showed us to the room where Harbour Master McLeod was. H.M.McLeod surprised me by saying that he wondered why no one from the Port had been to see him before and when X explained that we/mmnn we had been informed that he was not allowed to see anyone he replied that so far as he knew no such instructions had been issued by the Persian authorities. He informed me that he was being well looked after and was fairly comfortable. Jn enquiry from him how the incident of his arrest occurred he explained as follows: He had been instructed by the Asst. Port Officer, Abadan, to berth 'Palang” at No. 7 jetty at 0600 on 23rd instant. He boarded ’’Palang” a little before this time but could find no responsible officer on deck. He then went up to the bridge to see if any officers were in the Chart-room or Wheel house and finding no one there descended to the Main deck again where he saw one of the Engineer Officers who went to find one of the Navigating Officers. One of the Navigating Officers later spoke to McLeod and said that the vessel would not be ready to move for another 2 hours. McLeod then left ’’Palang” and returned to ’’Harmaq' telling the officer that he would return about 0800 hours to berth the ship. No objection was made to this remark by the officer. Mr. McLeod had not long returned to Harmaq when he was informed by one of the other Harbour Masters and the watchman that ’Malang’' was '’under way and proceeding up river at fast speed. ihe Harbour Master’s boat being still alongside 'Harmaq' McLeod immediately proceeded in her and followed Palang up river intending to board her. When he eventually arrived off 'Palang' she was only a few feet off No. 7 jetty and pre paring to pass her mooring lines asnore. He said he saw a sailor on the after-deck waving to him and he took it to mean/mean that he was to keep clear of 'palang's” propellers, n.e proceeded straight alongside on the river side about amidships and hoarded direct from the launch. There was no a.adder on this side at all. This was the usual way the Harbour Masters board the Persian sloops and no ladder is necessary. An officer, who afterwards I understand turned out to be the Senior Naval Officer, met him on deck and said something to him about being very busy and would see him later but made no objection to him boarding at the time. Mr. McLeod then naturally proceeded on to the bridge and as he found the vessel was being berthed normally said nothing. As far as he knows when he first boarded, there were no mooring ropes then ashore. When the vessel had finished ^berthing he was just about to get into his launch when he was asked to wait as the Senior Naval Officer wished to speak to him. He waited, thinking that the senior Naval officer wished to arrange the unberthing of Palang with him. He waited for some while and then as the Senior Naval officer did not appear he went to the gangway to go ashore but was stopped by an armed sentry. A man, who he understands was the S.N.Q’s Secretary, then said that the Senior Naval Officer had given him instructions to take Mr. McLeod to Mohammerali. McLeod refused to go to llohammerah ™it]a the Secretary, hut later did go with him accomoaniea hy 2 armed sailors as escort. When he arrived at uohammerah ^ ms accommodated in an Officer’s quarters and apparently is quite comfortable* During conversation he informed me that he had » officers there the same as the heard from one of the orncero , . M.naaar at Ahadan had informed me of A.P.O.C. Shipping Manager av aj regardingregarding the Persian .Sloops interfering with shipping cit Ahadan. ne also said that he had been told by one of the Persian Naval Officers that one or two of the sloops had proceeded down the Persian dulf to inspect - the Persian Oulf lights. After enquiring from McLeod I proceeded bach to Abadan in the British Consul*s car and returned to Harmaq. In conversation with the Harbour Masters Honey and Lawther they informed me that the Persian sloops are often in the habit of attempting to manoeuvre on and off the jetties with only one engine in action and asked for instructions. I told them that if they were asked to carry out the manoeuvre not to do so unless they were certain that both engines could be used and I also instructed them and the Asst, port Officer that the Harbour Masters services were always to be offered to he Persian sloops whenever they were in Abadan. The Harbour asters should proceed alongside the sloops and ask if their ervices are required before hoarding. If their services are efused, not to insist on hoarding hut to stand-by in their aunch and watch the manoeuvre so that if their services ra asked for subsequently they would he on hand to offer -hatever help they can. The Harbour Masters also informed ie that as a general rule they were well received when they iffered their services to the sloops and except in one or , mo cases, usually. I understand, when the Persian Senior fa val Officer is on hoard, no objection has been made to ■hem boarding. I then returned to Basrah, reporting my . rrlTaX to the Director.
