I consider Defence Officer necessary except on unjustifiable assumption that war will continue static indefinitely. Once 'total war' starts, with possible extension to Near and Middle East, protection of oil resources must be considerably more effective than at present and experience has shown that this definitely requires co-ordinating disciplinary and supervisory control of officer with military status. Also he is essential if local Volunteer Corps is to be formed and I regard this as important for two reasons:- (a) as additional protection (b) to keep British employees of Company content and thus to avoid possible fall in output required by His Majesty 1 s government. 3. I suggest insistence on rank and pay proposals made by me. These admittedly cause Byard some immediate loss but he would presumably get higher rate of pension later to compensate.

Officer.Confidential . No.C/1846 . Political Agency, o To Bahrain, the 7th December 1942. The Hon*ble the Political Keeident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain. Memorandum . X suggest that the time has come to reconsider the question of the rank of Major H.T. Hewitt M.C., who was appointed Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, in April 1941. 2. Majol' Hewict is about 49 years of age. He Joined the Connaught Hangers in 1913, served through the Great War (in which he won the Mona Star and the Military Cross), and later transferred to the K.S.L.I. He served for five years (1921 - 26) in the Egyptian Army. He retired from the K.S.L.I. in November 1934. t ^ v 3. Your recommendation, made in February 1941, that t'ejor Hewitt should be given the local rank of Lieutenant-Colonel was not accepted by the Air Ministry who observed that 'in the absence of specific reasons and In view of the smallness of the force' they saw no justification for the grant of the rank • C? t Q t proposed (vide Express Letter No.F.406-N/40 dated 17th April 1941 from the Government of India, External Affairs Department). 4. There now exist very substantial reasons why Major Hewitt should be given promotion. He is responsible for the administration of over 1000 military personnel (vide Distribution List forwarded with my Memorandum No.C/1732 dated 16th November 1942),and controls, in addition, a force of 160 special police who guard the Oil Company’s installations. He has many and varied duties to perform, including liaison between the military authorities and the Bahrain Government or myself, and the ship ment of masses of oil equipment being released hy the Oil Companies in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and oatar for essential / militarymilitary purposea elsewhere* His responsibilities are in no way less than those normally performed hy an officer of the rank of full Colonel. It is also relevant that the Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrain, whose administrative responsibilities, though considerable, are not comparable in volmae with those of Atajor Hewitt, enjoys the rank of Commander. 5. I should like to take this opportunity of recording that Major Hewitt has had an exceptionally difficult task to perform, as all measures taken by him have had to be considered in relation to local sentiment and prejudices, whether of the Shaikhs, of the Oil Company or of the native population; and that he has performed his task with unfailing tact and with a high measure of efficiency. 6. I strongly recommend, therefore, that the Persia Iraq Command be requested to grant to Major Hewitt the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel• Political Agent, Bahrain.m Defence Office, Persian Gulf ,at BRN* No DEp/S-18 //jfjAS. •Dated 7th December 1942, IR-iSb! rm H.BoM 1 s Political Agent, Bahrain.* P.Q.

Dated the 13th December, 1942 My dear General, &lt; - r b9M ixj rva- i X&gt;. I enclose a copy of a letter, No. C/1846, dated the 7th December 1942, which I have received from the Political TOifneosC 'ijir ^j - Agent at Bahrain, an the subject of* the Defence Officer, Persian Gulf, with which 1 fully concur. 2. I asked the Government of India on the 19th ^ P* /?&gt; February 1941 in my telegram No. T/10 that Major Hewitt should be given the local rank of Lieutenant Colonel on his appoint- ment, but they replied in their Express Letter No. 4C r 5-N/40 dated the 17th April 1941, th&amp;t the Air Ministry saw no jus tification for the grant of the local rank requested. Since then, as the Political Agent points out, the scope of his duties has increased out of all recognition and now form a very responsible charge. In addition to the large body of troops on the Islands he has a mass of correspondence on important and highly technical matters to conduct, duties which he has performed with a high measure of efficiency. He has, furthermore, managed to make himself agreeable to the very heterogeneous body of persons and conflicting interests with whom he has to deal. Major Hewitt gave up the post of Military Secretary to the Governor of the Punjab to come to the Persian Gulf and is, moreover, a regular officer of long and distinguished service. I therefore strongly recommentL that he be granted the rank 6f Lieutenant Colonel. Yours sincerely, General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, G.B.E., ? •C•B•, D.3.0., Commander-in-Chief, PAIFORCE. Sd * 0.
