Iraqi Charge d*Affaires has been asked by Minister for Foreign Affairs to inform his Government that according to information received from Iranian consuls at Kirkuk and elsewhere in Iraq there is a movement in Iraqi Kurdistan in favour of independence which might affect Iran. Charge d*Affaires replied that according to his information eight or nine Russians had been in Iranian Kurdistan trying to stir up trouble. • Charge d Affaires says that while Iranian Government doubtless realise that there is more danger to be expected from the north than from the south Minister for Foreign Affairs alluded as he had done once before to Kurdistan shooting trip of H.M. Ambassador at Baghdad as a suspicious circumstance. This absurd suspicion which Charge d'Affaires has tried to dissipate may have been sown by silly reports from Iranian consuls. From H.M.
