As I am chiefly responsible for the exclusion of Holmes from Bahrain up to date, I would be grateful if you would explain this to Cadman in any way you think, fit./ / I sa'Y Mr. Lonprrisg of Petroleum Concessions Ltd* this morning. I told him that B.P.C. have made representati ns locally against division of the area; they are much more anxious than they were lost year to obtain the whole of the unallotted area and are consequently prepared to moke a very much larger offer for it. I said that e felt that it was only fair to P.C.L. to acquaint them at once of this new development, in acordence with our undertaking to Lord Cadmon. Mr. Longrigg expressed his thanks fo' the Information, which he will at once passion to Lord Cadman. Subsequently Lord Cadman himself telephoned to me and expressed himself as v ry disturbed at the information which had been passed on to him by Mr. l.ongrigg. He referred to the fact that when he had rung up this Office on the 9th May, he had been given to understand that th^re was no need to worry Mu. or to tale of any action as our information wa© that P.C.L. would get what they wanted. He had apparently taken this ns a definite guarantee from us that thematter would be settled In favour of P.C.II# I exjlalned to him that it was nev? r intended to give any such definite guarantee, but that the information given to him on the 9th May was correct in the light of the information which we had then« Unfortunately the latest developments, of wh eh we have only just heard, ha 1 thrown the whole matter in the melting-pot again. Lord Cadin&amp;n then said that the new situation was very unsatisfactory from his point of view because whereas the American n.ut had for monthSJ&gt;een Vianuring the ground' as he ut it, P.C.L. had, at our request, removed their negotiator, Major H limes, and wt're thus heavily handicapped* He said that he would immediately telegraph out to Mr* Skliros the information which we haa given to hi^i but he stated that he might feel it necessary, if Mr* Skliros* subsequent report to him on the situation were not satisfactory, to ask to ace someone at the India Office and discuss the matter* I promised him that I w uld make a note of what he had said and pass it on* Later in the day Mr. Lefroy, w 1 has-a i nos!*■ 3. tele honed and said that he w-is rtn^in t 'in at Lord C Cadman’s request,^ inforr^4 us that it v'as desired by the Company to make uae of Major Holmes’ services os their negotiator if he could be got hold of* and to ask ub 9 in the llg^it of tht new situation* to withdraw our objections to him. I told Mr« Lefroy that I would immediately take the question up but that \.e could not give an ansver on this point without consulting the political Resident in the Persian Or If. Mr. Lefroy said that he qi ite understood that. The whole bus1ness is rather unfortunate, and I feel that there is considerable substance in Lord Caaman's complaint that his Company has been considerably handicapped in these negotiations by the absence of any negotiator at Bahrein* which resulted from Sir T. 'owle’s objection to Major Holrnes. As regards Lord Cadman’s telephone call on 9th May, a note of which is flagged at A on the file below* we could only answer him in the light of the information then in our possession* and we hadjust heard from Sir T. Fowls that the Sht ikh of Bahrein was proposing to divide the other allotted area in a manner which would give P.C.L. substantially what they wanted. In the li ht of the new situation I feel that it will be very difficult to maintain our objection to the use by the Company of Major Holmes’ services as a negotiator, and I put up a draft telegram to the iesi vent, giving a very strong lead in favour of meeting Lord Cabman*s request on this point.

During the last two or three years Major Holmes has been employed by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. as their Negotiator on the Trucial Coast; and although the Company have had a 'clear field' they have only succeeded in obtaining two concessions. The Political • r. Resident puts this down to the dilatory and unsatisfactory methods adopted by Major Holmes, and Sir Trenchard Powle has tola us tnat even as regards the two concessions, it was as mucn due to the efforts of himself and the Local Political Authorities, as to tne efforts of Major Holmes that the agreements were signed. That was tne position last June, when^perhaps fortunately. Major Holmes had to leave tne Gulf owing to ill-health; but on receiving information last December that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. were thinking of sending Major Holmes to Bahrein to examine tie situation with regard to the 'Bahrein Unalloted Area' the Resident telegraphed to say that ne had the strongest objection/objection to the employment ol* Major Holmes at Bahrein or elsewhere in the Persian Gulf (see telegram «3ru Becemoer BZ.7902/38). On receiving this telegram, — r * o^liros,^one ol the Directors of Petroleum Concessions Ltd vms as^ed to call here, whicn he aid on the 9th December. Mr. Walton informed nim in tne sense of the telegram and moreover gave- him a copy of it. to reau. Mr. Sicliros agreed not to send Major Holmes to Bahrein or elsewhere in the Gulf, but asked that an exception mignt be made of Koweit wnere he could iind out whether the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s attitude in regard to tne i^eutral Zone had altered. Subsequently after consultation with the Political Resident and tne Foreign Office^ a letter was sent to Mr. Skliros saying that we raised no objection to Major Holmes going to Koweit. The next event of importance was a telegram % aatea 26th March from the Political Resident stating tnat infomation nan been received that Major Holmes would arrive at Bahrein shortly on behalf of Petroleum Concessions ^td. in connection with the negotiations for the 'Bahrein Unalloted Area' and requesting that immediate steps should be taken to prevent this Happening. On recei^u of this telegram the Company were again approached, and acting on our advice,the arrangements for sending Major Holmes to Bahrein were cancelled; but by this time Major Holmes had reached Koweit, and on urgent representations from the Political _ Resident, a telegram^was sent to the Political Agent at / s * C (£1 2 0&lt;jl/l4l iMt* So*, fcu- ^ fj- Afj CSSsC ■ Ujctt in*' UtcjJ'v* fyto &lt;*+ thrive Ai 1 - Ia/gJJwC} ^ sLumo ktrut ^ g h, (tcIaju*.

Such was tne situation when Sir Trenchard Fowle came home on his recent deputation, and since then we have had several talks with the Company, who are apprehensive lest Ilajor Holmes, (who has now severed his connection with them), should resume his connection with their American rivals. ^ £ ^r- A record of a final discussion between Lord Cadman and Sir Trenchard Fowle on the subject will be * ' found below ana nothing now remains to be none except to dispose of Mr. Weightman*s telegram of the 24tn 8 * April, and to aecide wnat ai^er to return to Mr.Skliros's enquiry whether tne veto on Major Holmes applies to Koweit as well as to Banrein ana Tine Trucial Coast. The latter question is being dealt with separately. As regaras Mr. Y/eightman 1 s telegram, the position is that short of refusing to grant the necessary visa, we have no power to prevent Major Holmes from going to 1 Bahrein if he so wishes. There are obvious objections to refusing a visa, and Sir Trenchard Fowle, with whom tne matter was discussed before his departure, agrees that it would be inadvisable to do so. Since our grelo object in keeping Major Holmes away from Bahrein is to prevent him from entering into negotiations with the Sheikh, eitner for Petroleum Concessions Ltd. or any otner Company), it is thought here,(ana Sir Trenchard Fowle f j agrees,) that it will suffice if we tell the Sheikh of Banrein/ 5853 5000 3 374 Bahrein what we have already told Lord Cadman hat as a Negotiator major Holmes is Persona non grata to His Majesty’s Government.

NOTE. The question of the future employment of Major Frank Holmes in the Persian Gulf was discussed at a meeting at Britannic House on the 25th April at which Lord Caoman, Mr. Fraser, Mr. Skliros, Sir Trenchard Fowle and Mr. Symon were present. Mr. Skliros said that his understanding of his conversation with Mr. Walton on 9th December was that, while H.M.G. objected to the continued employment of Major Holmes on the Trucial Coast, these objections did not apply to Bahrein and Koweit. He said that soon after his conversation with Mr. Walton he had left for Bagdad and it was while he was there that he pursued the idea of employing Major Holmes at Bahrein in connection with the negotiations for the 'Unallotted Area'. He had accordingly asked the London office of the Company to send out Major Holmes provided he was fit and that the India Office saw no objection . When Major Holmes came to Bagdad he had assumed that it was with the approval of the India Office. This apparently was not the case. On learning that H.M.G. were not prepared to allow Major Holmes to act on behalf of the Company at Bahrein he had immediately withdrawn Major Holmes, who since then had severed his official connection with the Company. Mr. Skliros then went on to say that because of his influence with the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Sheikh’s family the Company were still anxious that Major Holmes should act for them in connection with the forthcoming negotiations; but if this was not acceptable to H.M.G. he would not press the point/ mumf point, and would try and tie Major Holmes up so as to prevent him from acting on behalf of their rivals. Sir Trenchard Fowle then said that he could only confirm what the Company had already been told, viz. that as a negotiator Major Holmes was persona non grata to H.M.G.; and he went on to point out that if, as appeared likely, the Sheikh had already maae up his mind to divide up the unallotted area between the American Company and Petroleum Concessions Ltd. the need for having Major Holmes on the spot would not arisd Mr. Skliros then asked whether the objections to Major Holmes applied to Koweit as well as to other parts of the Persian Gulf. He was informed by Sir Trenchard Fowle that this point would be considered. Lord Caoman said that he was prepared to accept the position as regards Major Holmes and would-not press for reasons; but, as regards what Sir Trenchard Fowle had said about the Sheikh dividing up the area, it was possible that the Sheikh f s ideas might fall short of what the Company wanted, and it was in this direction that personal influence with the Sheikh and his family ikight prove to be the decisive factor. He said the Company attached considerable importance to securing the area shown in Map 1, and leaving aside the question of obtaining oil they were most anxious to prevent their American rivals from extending their influence in this direction. He therefore hoped that H.M.G. would see their way to influencing the Sheikh to accept their proposals. Lora Caaman was promised that his views would be submitted for consideration. As regards procedure, Sir Trenchard Fowle said that nothing could be done until the Sheikh had intimated/ /U CLuxJbl' UfJi okMinute Paper Department. /*V intimated that he was ready to re-open negotiations. In reply to Lord Cadman, Sir Trenchard said that if the Company wanted to send out a negotiator from England he had no doubt that the Sheikh could be persuaded to wait until the negotiator arrived. Mr. Skliros then said that it was possible that as he was returning to Iraq, shortly he might go t o Bahrein himself to conduct the negotiations personally.©&gt; p Z 3 &amp; 76 I 3 &amp; Legal Advi fc 7 . 7 »*b- ^ Ut - K MY&amp; These papers deal with the activities of one Major Prank Holmes, a British subject who at one time acted on behalf of the Anple- American * H ' w€he in the latter capacity his methods were such as to- oonvinee -the loofrl political au-tho-^i tire-s that it Company nr of Hig Maje9ty T s Ou veriiment to permit/^j and on the strong recommendaLiun uf Llie Political ^e-b-ident in—Ihe Persian Qul-fv. the Company were informed accordingly.

The Company have accordingly asked for a further opportunity of discussing the matter and Sir Trenchard Fowle, the Political Resident (accompanied by a member of this Department), will t 4, /*f ? Jktsun y -A-%* c . see Lord Cadman,next Monday morning. At this interview it is proposed that Sir Trenchard Fowle should take the line that[owing to Major Holmes’ dilatory m^hods and tfce general unsatisfactory eondiTCt in his dealings with the local rulers he is definitely persona non-grata and that His Majesty’s **£**** 1* Government do not see their way to remove -the veI'd — on him. The Company a^ er-bTiTma^ r^ accept this advice but they will almost certainly ask for an assurance that His Majesty’s Government will do everything they can to ensure that Major Holmes is not allowed to act for their rivals. Such a request would be perfectly reasonable, but short of refusing the necessary visas (which has obvious objections) it is difficult to see how he can be prevented from preceding to Bahrein, and only two methods appear to be open to His Majesty’s Government to meet the Company’s wishes viz: (a) to tell3 the SheikKof Bahrein (with whom Major Holmes is on friendly terms) that Major Holmes is definitely persona non-grata to His Majesty’s Government and that consequently they would prefer that he, the Sheiktf, should refuse to accept Major Holmes as a negotiator for any Company,and (h) to tell the rival American Company (with whom we have some influence) that as Holmes is no longer persona grata to His Majesty’s Government they would prefer that the Company should not employ him as a negotiator. Lord Cadman confidentially that these are the steps which we would propose to take to prevent Major Holmes from acting for American interests. As you will appreciate the matter is one of 4 * drring ur Sk^lftg 'anything wliioh would leaverua open to a charge from Major Holmes that our action was detrimental to his future prospects of employment; some delicacy, and—a-l all: CHst i m must try tu avulfl &lt;J/'. and from this point of view we should he glad to know ft (a* p whether you think we might safely^act on the lines v. on th#* linfac suggested at (a) and (h) above and to ou» informing^: From, E X P R ESS LETTER. pp:izri ! , 690 1 0 The Political Agent, r^uwaij.

Chairman has agreed to recall Holmes and will he glad if you will arrange accordingly at earliest possible moment.” I told Mr. Lewisohn that we should probably wish to send the gist of the above t o the Political Agent at Bahrein. He saw no objection to this being done, but asked that the telegram might be held up until to-morrow, in order to give Mr. Skliros the ’’Chairman has seen Walton and Powle and has ascertained that under no circumstances can they vary opportunity of taking action himself. Vi.The position in regard to the unallotted area is that the Sheikh of Bahrein informed both Companies (the Bahrein Petroleum Co. and Petroleum Concessions Ltd.) about the end of April last that he had decided to postpone all negotiations for one year. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. reopened the matter last summer, and the Sheikh again informed them that he was not disposed to reopen negotiations at present. On receiving Sir T. Fowle’s telegram of 3rd December, T/274 (P.Z. 7902/37) containing information that the Coy. intended sending Major Holmes to Bahrein 'to examine the situation with regard to the unallotted area', I asked Mr. Skliros to call here, which he did on 9th December. I informed him in the sense of this telegram, and moreover gave him a copy of it to read. Mr. Skliros agreed not to send Major Holmes to Bahrein or elsewhere in the Gulf, except that he asked that an exception might be made of Koweit, where he could find out whether the Sheikh of Koweit’s attitude in regard to the neutral zone had altered. (In making this suggestion Mr. Skliros’s point was that he wished to find some employment for Major Holmes to fill up his time.) In view of the above facts, it seems to me impossible that/. that Mr. Skliros could have failed to understand that we objected to Major Holmes going to Bahrein. The results of our conversation are stated in the tf telegram sent to Sir T. Fowle on ^Zth December. Subsequently, on receiving the telegram of 17th December from Sir T. Fowle, a letter was sent to Mr. Skliros (after consultation with the F.O.) on 11th January saying that we raised no objection to Major Holmes going to Koweit. ij. h itF!LP COPY C rp. z* &gt;09 !

Political Agent at Bahrain, visited trucial coast where Holmes suggested the # words ''buy or* and '’purchase or (?”), should be delated from Article 13 (a) of draft concession* I approved of this, and concession was signed on May 22nd, by Sheikh of Dibai and Holmes as representative of the Company, and attested by the Political Agent* All letters connected with the agreement except; (a) that conveying approval of Hi© Majesty's Government to the agreement, and (b) intimation of the Company’s acceptance of arrangement, were exchanged,, that, on the night of May 22nd, he had received a telegr&amp;m from the Company saying that they could not authorise him to sign the concession unless Article 13 (a) stood as previously drafted, and added that the Sheikh was willing to make the ^-lir/lft India office letter P C Z C 7856'36 S December 2nd, 1936) 3 On May 23rd, Holme?, informed the Political Agent changeclmng8« 4 t x telegraphed Political Agent that change could he made if Sheikh agreed*, but that, if he did not agree, ocnceeaion should stand as signed and that letter la) should issue to Sheikh* Sheikh did not agree to change and. Political Agent issued letter (a)« 5* This was obviously the only action possible,. The Sheikh was entirely within his rights in refusing to alter the ooncesslon^ and any attempt to bring pressure to bear on him to do so would have given him opportunity of cancelling concession altogether, which he might not h&amp;va been sorry to takec. 6* Whole conduct of Dlbai negotiations on the part of the Company and Holmes have been unsatisfactory and that Sheikh h&amp;e signed concession is due as much to his personal promise to me as to any efforts on the part of the Company* Holmes has been most dilatory and 1 nave good evidence that Haji Williamson, also employed by the Company on the truciai coast, has been intriguing on behalf of the Cali format-Arabia Standard Oil Crmpshy. and against the Sheikh of Pibal, who has asked that he should not be allowed back in Dibai territory* 7 C Five other Truoial Coast Sheikhs have still to grant concessions, particularly Shargah and Ras-al** Khaimuhs whose options expire respectively on September 26th, and August 1st, Holmes has informed the Politi. al Agent that he will no* approach Sheikhs of Kas-ai-Khaimah and Sh^rgah, but Political Agent understands agreemente for these Sheikhs are not yet finally drafted c xf this is so, l cannot understand Company' s and/or Holmes inefficiency in not Jiaving these ready, especially ae Holmes gave me to understand that, directlydirectly Dibai conceeoictrj wae signed, he was prepared to negotiate with other Sheikhac In the meantime, I am urging Holmes, through Political Agent, to approach these Sheikhs immediately on the lines of T)ibai concession,, 8 0 Holmes has told Political Agent that he is asking the Company to relieve him ae soon as possible as he is unwell* 9 C I venture to suggest that Company's headquarters in London be approached on the following lines; (a) unsatisfactory nature of their conduct of negotiations up to date should be impressed on them with a view to their displaying more activity in future; (b) that they should telegraph hnmedlateLy to Holmes giving terms of Shargah and Ras^al^Khaimah concessions and directing him to pursue negotiations with these Sheikhs forthwith; (c) it is obvious that Holmes cannot, with his Trucial Coast preoccupations, proceed to Muscat and that another representative should be sent there imm.ed3ately c (in this connection see your express letter P e Z o 3099, 11th May)* i suggest fd' Muscat, Mylies, who is a first-rate man and who got Qatar concessions 10 c What it comes to is that unieps Company bestir themselves there is a distinct danger of the remaining Trucial Coast Shaikhdomo and of Muscat being captured by the California Arabia Standard Oil Co c or by American-Italian interests, vide my express letter C*-10? e 1st May*i 9 etp/. t gs/aw, From 2890 .
