                           Ormondeand HMS
                           Lupin. The correspondence is concerned with the ship HMS
                           Ormondeleaving Aden to carry out surveys in the Gulf and the question of whether a survey would be permitted to take place in Oman or not. While the Council of Ministers to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman granted permission for a survey to take place, further permissions were required from the shaikhs of Khassab, Bukha, Diba and Kumzar, which are parts of the region of Musandam in Oman. Some tribes from the region, the Shihuh in particular, opposed the landing of the navy ship in their territories. The Political Resident warned that the landing of any British personnel in Shihuh region would be attended by grave risk in the future.To subdue the shaikhs of Khassab, the Political Resident recommended to the Government of India that the Naval Ship HMS
                           Lupin, should be authorised to carry out a bombardment of parts of Khassab and, in the event of the shaikhs’ withdrawal to the mountains, this should be followed by a blockade of the Khassab area. British officials were also concerned with the necessity of reaching agreements with the Trucial Shaikhs and with those of the region of Musandam. The file also includes correspondence with the Council of Ministers at Muscat regarding the imprisonment of the Shaikh of Khassab, Hasan bin Muhammad.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Bukha</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ships</topic></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Shiḥūḥ (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Musandam Peninsula </geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khassab</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Diba</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000281#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000281#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
