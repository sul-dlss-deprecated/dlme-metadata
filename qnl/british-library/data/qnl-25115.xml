Mr. Chester s proposals for the construction of the railway were, in the first instance, made on conditions moie favourable to the Turkish Government than those offered by Mr. Glasgow, and, though the actual terms of the contract are not yet known, it is understood that a num oer o modifications to the advantage of the Turkish Government have been introduced m the original proposals. It must follow, therefore, that, in the present advanced stage of the negotiations between Mr. Chester and the Government, it would not be possible for your group to put forward Mr. Glasgow’s scheme with any reasonable hope o competing successfully with a scheme to which the Tuikish Government wo c seem to some extent to be committed. , , I am to. add that His Majesty’s Government are quite unable, as suggested by Mr. Edwards in his letter of the 13th May, to use a refusal to consent to the possible increase in the Turkish customs duties as a lever for obtaining the acceptance of the scheme by the Turkish Government. . ^, . , The report in original,^ which was enclosed in Mr. Edward s letter, is returned herewith. 1 am, &amp;c.

S ' r ’ AMONG the many questions discussed during the final session of Parliament on the Srd instant was that of the construction and prolongation of a railway from Ada- Ilazar (where the short branch line from Sahanja, on the Anatohan Railway, at piesen ends) to Bolu and onwards towards the Black Sea, a distance of about 200 kilom. altogether. ^ o{ this qnest i on j s as obscure as that of all other similar matters in this country, but,'so far as I can ascertain, the chief promoter of the scheme has been Moukhtaf Bey Director of Railways in the Ministry of Public Works. It was certainly he who induced M. Huguenin, who showed no particular eagerness to accept the contract to submit a plan to Berlin, whereby the Anatolian Railway Company were to build the line for a kilometric guarantee of 15,000 fr. and the right to double the local line between Haidar Pasha and Pendik. It was this last concession whic i moved M Huguenin, but his directors in Berlin refused to undertake the uo k, thereupon the Turkish Government stated that the kilometnc guarantee would be secured on customs revenues, which induced the Berlin board to change their min . The convention, as submitted to Parliament, merely stated that it was for the • construction of a railway from Ada-BazarGo Bolu and some 135 kilom. further, to a terminus not yet decided upon, and for the doubling of the Haidar Pasha len i line while the kilometric guarantee had been fixed at lo, 0 UU Ir. ’ In this form it was, after some discussion, voted by the Chamber as a matter of urgency but the conflict with the Senate, described in my despatch 391 of the OthTime, then supervened, and the convention has therefore not received the sanction of the latter body. j have &amp;c aVe ’ GERARD LOWTHER.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey—(Rec^ved June 20.) gj ' 1 . 0 ^ ' ^ June 20, 1911 WITH reference to your despatch No. 149 of the 30th ultimo, enclosing certain papers relative to a proposed concession for railways in Asia Minor, I have the honour t 0 observe that the scheme referred to in these documents is, as yon are aware, the one which was originally submitted to the Turkish Government in 1909 by a certain Dr. Glasgow. „ ^ , i t Tins sell 6 ni 6 at first ni 6 t witli soiii 6 favour in Cioi 6 iiiiii 6 iit and parliamentai j circles, but the negotiations were suspended and eventually ceased when Mr. Chester came forward with his proposal to construct the same network of lailrvajs on conditions which appeared more favourable to the Government than those offered by Dr. Glasgow. Mr. Chester’s project has been before the Government for nearly two years, and negotiations had advanced so far that, as I had the honour to inform you in my despatch No. 383 of the 2nd instant, the Government was m a position to lay all the papers as well as the convention drawn up and agreed to b} the Public M orks Department and Mr. Chester, before Parliament in the eail} pait of last month. Owing, however, to the approach of the closure of the session, the House vas unable to devote any time to the examination of the project and the inattei has consequent!} been placed on the agenda for early discussion when Parliament meets foi the m xt autumn and winter session. It is understood that the long negotiations betv een Mr. Chester and the Public Works Department resulted in changing some of the proposals first made by Mr. Chester, and that the convention as finally diawn up and presented to Parliament, embodies a considerable number of modifications favourable to the Government. A copy of this draft convention has so far not been procurable, and it is therefore impossible to compare the proposals, as they now stand, with those of the Glasgow' scheme contained in the papers communicated by Lord Denbigh. The Government is now' so far committed to the Chester project that I think there is little chance of other proposals being considered, unless they offered conditions clearly more advantageous than those which now stand in Mr. Chesters name. The region of country through which the proposed railway is to pass is mostly mountainous, and the cost of construction would consequently be high; the railway w ill enjoy no guarantee, and the return on expended capital will have to be derived solely from traffic receipts and such problematical profits* as can be made out of the working 0 f mines which the concessionnaire may chance to find within a certain zone on either side of the line. Whilst unable to form an opinion as to the real merits of such a concession, I am inclined to believe that although the construction of such a network of railways will be beneficial to the country, the conditions offered for carrying out such an undertaking are altogether of too speculative a character to engage the attention of serious capitalists. Lord Denbigh and his friends will, however, have to satisfy themselves as to the soundness of the scheme now before the Government and in the event of a favourable view being taken they will have the option of either joining hands with Chester or submitting proposals more favourable than those to which the Government seems at present committed.

No one, he contends, can seriously mean to construct and exploit a network of railways which must involve an annual deficit of some 400,000L The real intention of the concessionnaires, he maintains, is to use the time to be allowed under the contract for surveys to prospect for mines, and then to say that they find the project is too difficult, and to ask for concessions over the best mineral areas as com pensation for their time and trouble. Whatever may be the deep designs of Mr. Chester’s backers, the purpose of this article is quite clear : it is to instil a note of alarm into the minds of the deputies, and to rouse parliamentary opposition at the moment when the scheme is to be submitted for the sanction of the Chamber. It is, in all probability, inspired by the 'German Embassy and the Anatolian Railway Company, who are not in the least anxious to see feeders for their own line built ’by outsiders, and are still less inclined to allow the construction of a rival port at Youmourtalik, just opposite their own port at Alexandretta. the Grand Vizier and the opponents of the project generally hope, by continued post ponement and delay, to disgust Mr. Chester and his group, and thus cause the 'ASTATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. .IB— Section 4.

Sazonoff had already told me, as reported in my despatch No. 45 of the 21st February last, that the Russian Ambassador had been instructed to support the French group, that was endeavouring to obtain the contract for its construction, should the French Ambassador request him to do so. Though the Russian Government might consent eventually to a revision of the agreement of 1900 respecting the Black Sea, Basin, there was, his Excellency said, no question at present of their abandoning the attitude which they had adopted in their recent negotiations- with Germany with regard to the construction of lines from the Bagdad Railway in a north-easterly direction towards the Russian and Persian frontiers.

WITH reference to Mr. Marling’s despatch No. 944 bf the 30th December last, I understand that the Grand Vizier has recently made it quite clear to the promoters of the Chester scheme that it did not have his support, and the Minister of War has also assumed a similar attitude, the latter having even openly stated that the granting of the concession would he regarded by Germany as an unfriendly act, and that Tut key was not disposed to take any step by which she might forfeit the friendship of that Power. It has for the past year been understood that the scheme had the support ot a majority of the Chamber, and the American Embassy has made no concealment of their opinion that the failure to conclude the business is the result of pressure brought to bear by the German Ambassador against the scheme. This doubtless lias been an influential factor in the adverse attitude adopted by the Ottoman Government towards the scheme, but 1 have reason to believe that what has specially influeneed the Grand Vizier has been his disinclination to see the advent into Turkey of American capital on a large scale. His Highness believes that as regards other Great Powers active interference in support of their interests will always be held in check by the existing balance of power in Europe, but that America not being restrained by any considerations of this nature might at any moment even go so far as to dispatch a fleet here for the safeguard of what she considered to be her interests. _ The matter is, however, not finally disposed ot, and at the present moment is being used by the Armenian deputies in the parliamentary situation. These being in favour of the scheme threaten to withdraw their support from the Government if the latter do not change their attitude on the question. # Quite latterly it has been suggested that the Chester group might possibly come to terms with the Bagdad Railway Company. ^ Baron von Marschall mentioned the matter to me yesterday, and said that the failure to obtain the concession was by the Americans and their supporters laid at his door. This, he said, was quite untrue. The only observation he had made in official quarters was that there would be a difficulty about the Chester scheme finding an outlet for its line at Youmourtalik, but that this was a matter of arrangement between the two companies. Baron von Marschall must have forgotten that last year he confided to me the fact that he had entered a protest to the Grand Vizier against the scheme, as recorded in my despatch No 357 of the 4th June, 1910.

I HAVE, on different occasions during the past two years, had the honour to address you on the subject of the Samsoun-Sivas Railway and the interest which the Russian Embassy was taking in the concession for that line. In my despach No. 533 of the 10th July, 1909,1 reported a conversation I had had with the Grand Vizier on the subject, in which he referred to the agreement made between the Russian and Ottoman Governments in 1900, and copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 57, Confidential, of the 27th January, 1909. I have now ascertained that the Russian Ambassador last year again approached the Porte in regard to this question, but he was verbally informed that the agreement of 1900, containing a stipulation that railways “ dans les provinces septentrionales delaTurquie d’Asie ” would not be given to any foreign subjects except Russians, embraced another condition, namely, that the Russian Government would prevent the Armenian revolutionaries from returning to Turkey. As under the constitution this condition had no longer any raison d'etre, the Turkish Government no longer felt itself bound by the conditions regarding railways laid down in the agreement. M. Tcharykow, I understand, left the matter there, but recently general conversations have begun again on the subject, and he has suggested that some arrangement 'might be arrived at on the lines of the Russian Government, abandoning the rights to the Samsoun-Sivas line on condition that the Turkish Government should bind itself in the future to link up the lines with those to be eventually constructed in Russian territory on the Turkish frontier.

Ruxine and Marmora British Development Syndicate to Sir A . Nicolson.—(Received January 10.) Finsbury Pavement House, London, Dear Sir Arthur Nicolson, January 7, 1911. YOU may remember that when I recently called on you with regard to this syndicate, and when you kindly said you would write to our embassy in Spain with reference to the concessions we are endeavouring to obtain there, I told you that the syndicate had originally been formed for the purpose of trying to obtain the concession of the Samsoun-Sivas railway from the Turkish Government. You subsequently were good enough to write and say that you had heard the Turks were going to make this railway themselves. The Turkish Government did announce this as their intention, and then the Russian group with whom we are working took action, and his Excellency M. Anatole de Moltchanoff, who is the leader of that group, proceeded to obtain from his Government a definite promise of their support for our Anglo-Russian group, combined in the syndicate. He went to Constantinople about six weeks ago and saw the Russian Ambassador there, who had previously been supporting a French group represented by a M. Salandrouse de Morny, but on receiving formal instructions from his Government he withdrew this support and transferred it to us. Thereupon the French group immediately left Constantinople, and with the exception of an American group, represented by a Mr. Chester, ours is now the only serious applicant in the field. We are informed that the proposals of the Chester group are not to the liking of the Turks, and that Chester has no chance of getting the business. With regard to the Turks making it themselves, we are informed that this is pure “ blague.” They advertised for tenders for the work, but the Government engineer who drew up the conditions of contract deliberately put in such terms that nobody tendered. The day after the tenders were due, an advertisement appeared saying the time was up, and that tenders were going to be examined, and then, in spite of the fact that there were no tenders, another Government notice appeared soon after, about the 17th December, intimating that the Government engineers were about to leave for the spot. M. de Moltchanoff has just been to London and informed us that the Turks have no intention at all of attempting to make the railway, but that they have a genuine desire that the railway should be made, as so far the Young Turks have absolutely nothing of this sort to show for the three years they have been in office. We are informed that there is, therefore, an excellent chance of our being able to get the concession to build the line if we are well supported by our embassy. We are assured of vigorous support from the Russian Embassy. Unless in the next week or so there are changes in the Turkish Ministry—which are fully expected—and which may make it desirable to delay matters for three or four weeks, I propose to arrive at Constantinople about the 24th January to represent the syndicate and make formal application along with M. de Moltchanoff. I should be greatly obliged if you would be good enough, to instruct the British Embassy to give us all the support possible. It will be an important piece of business, involving about 3,000,000k, and would bring excellent orders to our manufacturers of railway material. Believe me, &amp;c. DENBIGH.

Mr. Marling also states that as no one had come forward to undertake the construction of the entire railway on the terms desired by the Turkish Government, the Ministry of Public Works had decided to contract for the building of the first 90 kilom. of the line in small sections of 10 kilom. each ; and it has been announced in the Turkish press that a Turkish contractor, who had been employed on the Hedjaz railway, had undertaken the first sections. Mr. Marling doubts whether this procedure will be found to be practicable for the whole railway, as after the first 40 or 50 kilom. difficult country is encountered, necessitating the use of more expensive appliances than native contractors can command.

I did not clearly understand from him the nature of the hitch, but he spoke of the Ottoman Government now inviting or being about to invite tenders for the construction. Dr. Richardson writes to me under date the 17th December, 1910, that the engineers who were to have arrived at Hodeidah at the end of last October to proceed with the construction of the line had not yet arrived, and that it was not known when they would arrive. He writes further, under the same date, that some hitch appears to have occurred m the negotiations at Constantinople since the recent failure of the Ottoman Government to raise the well-known loan in Paris, and that he hears incidentally that German and British syndicates respectively have entered the field of competition, and have submitted tenders on more favourable terms, the French tender being unacceptable as regards both cost of construction and kilometric guarantee but that his French colleague at Hodeidah thinks the work of construction will soon be taken in hand and the concession secured by the French syndicate.

WITH reference to your telegram No. 13 of the 14th instant, to which I briefly replied in my telegram No. 12 of yesterday, I have the honour to report that 1 have learnt from the Russian charge d’affaires that the application of the Russo-1 rench group, represented here by M. Sallandrouze de Lamornaix, to obtain the concession for the Samsoun-Sivas Railway has been consistently and warmly supported by the Russian Embassy, and in his opinion the group could not be considered to have definitely withdrawn. M. Swetchine personally thought that their chances of success were small, but he felt that the Turks regarded any application in which Russian capita] was interested for railway construction from the shores of the Black Sea with disfavour, and consequently, when he heard of the Anglo-Russian syndicate through M. Monchanoff he had not attached very much importance to it. M. Monchanoff, he added, was a very wealthy man, and one of the largest shareholders in the Russian Compagnie de Navigation de la Mer Noire. From other sources I have learnt that as no one had come forward to undertake the construction of the entire railway on the terms desired by the Turkish Government, the Ministry of Public Works had decided to contract for the building of the first 90 Idiom, of the line in small sections of 10 kilom. each, and it was announced in the press a day or two ago that a Turkish contractor who had been employed on the 1 ledjaz Railway had undertaken the first section, it would seem that it is this action of the Public Works Department that has led the Euxine and Marmora syndicate to infer that the Russo-French group has abandoned its efforts to obtain the concession. It is doubtful, however, whether this procedure will be practicable for the entire railway, for although the first 40 or 50 kilom. present no engineering difficulties whatever, the line afterwards enters hilly country, where heavy work necessitating more expensive plant than a native contractor could command will be required. It is also very improbable that Turkish finances could bear the strain ol so considerable an under- In this connection I may mention that Mr. Chandos Stanhope, who is now in Constantinople, has been studying the possibilities of this railway, but he has declined to reveal on whose behalf he is working. He is, however, about to leave C onstantinople owing to the state of his health. (Very Confidential.) I gathered from what M. Swetchine said that he himself is persuaded that the group represented by M. Lamornaix has absolutely no chance of obtaining the conces sion, but that the Russian Ambassador is of a different opinion, and will on his return actively resume his efforts on their behalf. To judge from recent articles in the press, there is a strong anti-Russian feeling here at present, and it may well be questioned whether the present Government would care to run counter to it by granting a concession, even for the construction ol a railway in the regions in question, to a Russian, or partly Russian, syndicate.

Sir, Foreign Office, January 13, 1911. WITH further reference to your letter of the 11th November regarding Mr. Chester’s negotiations with the Turkish Government for a railway concession in Asiatic Turkey, l am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform you that, according to a report received from His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Constantinople, enquiries have been made by the commercial attache to His Majesty’s Embassy, from which it appears that the Chester scheme has been actively pressed lately, and hopes are entertained by the American Embassy that the concession may be obtained by American capitalists, though strong opposition from German interests is anticipated. Certain modifications have, it is understood, been made in the draft convention, especially as regards the mining rights to be conceded. The Council of Ministers is reported to have been unwilling to give the monopoly of all mines on either side of the projected railway to the concessionnaire, and to have decided that, with the exception of the Arghana copper-mines and the oil-fields of the Mosul province, the group is to enjoy no special privileges over any mines, and must be bound by the mining laws and regulations in respect of such as they may discover and wish to work. The group will, however, receive the rights to the Arghana copper- mines and to the Mosul oil-fields. The group does not appear to have obtained rights iu the Bagdad and Bussorah vilayets, and there seems to be no question at present of introducing the modifications suggested by j^ou in your letter under reply. His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Constantinople points out in this connection that, in view of the fact that you have no strictly legal or preferential rights to the oil concession, it is difficult to see how you can actively intervene to prevent that concession from being diminished by the grant of part of the rights to be comprised in it to a group which offers terms, in the opinion of the Turkish Government, more advantageous to the country, unless you are able to amend your application in such a manner that it will present greater attractions than the Chester group are able to offer. Until you can do so, Mr. Marling fears that such representations as your agents or His Majesty’s Embassy can make will not avail to deter the Turkish Government from concluding negotiations with the American group, or to induce them to sacrifice the undoubted benefits which their scheme promises.

[330] 't No. 1. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 4, 1911.) (No. 944.) Sir, Constantinople, December 30, 1910. IN reply to your despatch No. 349 of the 21 st ultimo, I have the honour to report that the commercial attache to this embassy has, under my instructions, been enquiring what is the present state of the negotiations proceeding between Mr. Chester and the Turkish Government for a concession for a railway and mining rights in Asia Minor, and from Mr. Weakley’s report enclosed herewith you will see that there does nor appear to be any question for the present of the draft concession being modified in the sense which Mr. D’Arcy suggested in his letter to you of the 11 th November ' 7 On the other hand, it seems probable that if the concession be given to the Chester group —and the American Embassy has hopes of eventual success—it will include, besides the Arghana copper mine, rights to the oil-fields in the Mosul vilayet, and this will of course pro tanto afiect the value of the oil concession which D’Arcy desires to obtain. The Chester group, however, obtain no rights in the Bagdad and Bussorah vilayets. Mr. D’Arcy’s agents in Constantinople are, so far as I can ascertain, taking little or no action at present ; and, indeed, inasmuch as Mr. D’Arcy has, in their view, no strictly legal rights, nor even preferential rights, to the oil concession, it is difficult to see how they can actively intervene to prevent the value of that concession being diminished by the grant of another concession which the Turkish Government consider to offer greater advantages to the country. Mr. D’Arcy has merely a moral claim in consideration of the long negotiations and verbal assurances made before the Chester scheme came on the tapis, and it would be too much to expect that the Turkish Government should on their account sacrifice the very great benefits which the Chester project promises. Mr. D’Arcy has in fact been outbidden, so to speak, by the Chester group, and it is for him to decide whether he will endeavour to obtain the oil concession by modifying his application so as to offer greater attractions to the Turks than those proffered by the Chester scheme ; but until he does so I fear that no representations made either by his agents here or by His Majesty's Embassy will deter the Porte from concluding negotiations with Mr. Chester. There is, of course, always the prospect that the opposition of the Bagdad Railway Company may prevent the Chester scheme from going through, in which case Mr. D’Arcy’s moral claims might be insisted on as against other possible competitors. I /VC CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1. Report by Mr. Weakley respecting D’Arcy's Claims to Mosul Petroleum Concession. MESSRS. GILCHRIST AND WALKER, D’Arcy’s agents in Constantinople, whom I have seen, tell me the information they have received from private sources indicates that the Chester scheme of railway construction in Asia Minor is at present being very actively pushed, and seems to have a very fair chance of success. I have also spoken to the chief dragoman of the United States Embassy on the subject, and learn that the embassy has very sanguine hopes of the concession being obtained by American capitalists, but it is thought that the German opposition to the granting of the concession will still be very strong. Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker inform me that some modifications in the draft convention have been recently made by the Council of Ministers, especially as regards the mining rights which form a prominent part of the project. It appears the Council of Ministers have not been willing to give Chester the monopoly of all the mines to be found on either side of the projected railway ; they have decided that, with the exception of the copper mines at Arghana (Diarbekir), which is a Government monopoly, and the [1851 d—1]2 oil-fields at Mosul, Chester’s group will enjoy no special privilege over any mines, and that the mining regulations will have to be adhered to and respected in regard to any mines Chester and his associates may discover and wish to work. The rights to the Arghana copper mine, as well as those to the oil-fields in the Mosul district, will be given to Chester. This decision seems to have been definitely come to owing to the Ministry of Mines having pressed the Porte for instructions regarding the issue of prospecting licences (“ permis de recherches ”) in the districts through which the Chester railway will pass ; prospecting licences for petroleum were granted some time ago to several persons at Mosul by the local authorities, and the holders of these permits applied to the Mining Department for their confirmation. At the same time applications continued to be received by the department for licences to prospect for petroleum in the Bagdad province, and, in view of the Chester proposals, the department was obliged to apply to the Porte requesting that it might be officially informed of the trace of the Chester railway, and in what districts and for wdiat kinds of mines and minerals was the department at liberty to grant prospecting permits. In reply, the Porte said that the trace of the line had not been settled, but the Ministry was free to grant “ permis de recherches ” for all kinds of mines in the districts mentioned in the Chester negotiations, except petroleum. In consequence the licences issued by the Mosul authorities have not been confirmed, and the applications received from Bagdad have been refused. All this points to the decided intention of the Government to exclude D’Arcy’s proposals for the concession of the petroleum fields in the Mosul province, and to ignore whatever claims he may have established towards obtaining the concession. Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker admit that D’Arcy cannot be said to have any strictly legal rights (“ droits acquis ”) or even preferential rights to the concession, for these can only be obtained through a “ permis de recherches,'’ firman, or official contract, none of which is in D’Arcy’s possession. In this respect D’Arcy’s rights are in no way inferior to Chester’s. It is, however, contended that D’Arcy has certain moral rights which ought not to be overlooked. Negotiations for obtaining the concession were entered into wfith the Civil List some seveu years ago by Mr. D’Arcy’s representative, Mr. Nicols, when that department had the control of all petroleum fields in Turkey. The proposals put forward had been taken into serious consideration and negotiations had reached a very advanced stage, and the matter had been taken up by His Majesty’s Ambassador, who on several occasions spoke both to the Grand Vizier and to the Sultan, and had received assurances that every consideration would be given to the proposals put forward by D’Arcy. On the promulgation of the constitution in 1908, the control of the petroleum fields was transferred to the Ministry of Mines, and consequently Mr. Nicols has continued his negotiations with that department ever since. Glasgow’s proposals made last year for building railways in the interior from Yumurtalik to Diarbekir and Mosul, on the condition that all the rights to mines found within a certain radius on either side of the line were granted, found favour with the Government and the Senate, the latter issuing a decree in August 1909 authorising the Public Works Department to negotiate for the construction of railways on the terms proposed by Glasgow. Glasgow’s scheme—which has now become Chester’s scheme—comprises all deposits of petroleum found near the line of railway, and especially said to exist in the Mosul district. D’Arcy’s negotiations and prospects have naturally been affected by this American scheme, and Messrs. Gilchrist and Walker are of the opinion that something should be done to protect, not D’Arcy’s legal, but the moral rights which he has undoubtedly acquired after so many years of negotiation. It must be borne in mind that the ex-Grand Vizier, Hussein Hdmi Pasha, urged D’Arcy, through Mr. Nicols, to take up the railway scheme in conjunction with the petroleum concession, but D’Arcy declined.

[ 41228 ] Sir, Mr. D’Arcy to Foreign Office.—(Received November 12.) 42, Grosvenor Square, London, November 11, 1910. REFERRING to my letter dated the 8 th April last, in connection with the concession for the oilfields of Mesopotamia which was promised to me by the Turkish Government some time ago, I beg to state that from information to hand from Constantinople it appears that active negotiations are again in progress between Mr. Chester and the Turkish Government for the Anatolian Railway project, and that important modifications of the original draft contract are under consideration. One modification that I fear may be put forward, and which would seriously imperil the value of the concession which was promised to me, is that latitude may be given to the Chester group to start construction from either end, or both ends, of the proposed line without the onerous obligation contained in the original draft contract of completing construction of the line for the whole of the route from the Mediterranean to the Province of Moussoul before any portion of the oil part of the concession could be touched. The danger of this would be that the American group, who are endeavouring to secure the Anatolian Railway concession together with its mining rights, might be able at a comparatively small cost and within a very short time to open up the valuable portions of the oilfields of Moussoul, which I have reason to believe are their principle objective, and thus seriously prejudice the value of the concession which was promised to me. Under these circumstances I shall be extremely obliged if you would ask His Majesty’s Minister at Constantinople to guard against this point, and to firmly resist the introduction into the proposed Anatolian Railway concession of any modifications which are likely to effect the value of the oil concession as a whole. I am informed that the Chester group have indicated willingness to accept the Anatolian Railway concession outright, i.e., that they are not asking for an option, and that their proposals are receiving the warmest support of the Union and Progress Committee.

After Bitlis it is intended to visit A T an and Mosul. Mr. Colt has written enthusiastically of the possibilities of the Arghani copper mines. The output of these mines is exported to the United Kingdom; in 1909 45,000L worth of copper was extracted. He regards Diarbekir as the most promising province for exploitation by the projected railway. If coal is discovered, the question of fuel will be simplified. It is hoped that in Mosul it may be possible to use the local petroleum for fuel. I understand that the Chester group are prepared to finance the proposed Turkish railway from Sivas to Samsun, as it is important that their projected line (Sivas- Diarbekir-Bitlis-Van-Mosul) should he connected with a Black Sea port.

He further stated to me that in spite of the comments of the Constantinople press as regards the opposition raised by the German Government against the scheme, the negotiations between the Turkish Government and Mr. Chester’s syndicate are progressing successfully. Mr. Colt was quite sure that if the Ottoman Parliament during the next session were disposed to approve of and vote the project, they would commence the construction of the line from Samsun and Sivas in next spring and would achieve the wdiole work in three or four years, building the line by sections. He and his German companion, a prospector, took certain elevations in and in the vicinity of this town, and studied the conditions of commerce and labour. The positive statements of the above Mr. Colt as regards the construction of a railway line in this semi-barbarian country would lead one to believe that the project may be achieved in the following few years, and that the subsequent development of this country and its resources will bring material prosperity and moral and intellectual uplift to these dark regions.

I HAVE not written to you for some time as there was nothing in your letters to reply to, and no change in the position has taken place. The letters from you that I have to acknowledge are yours of the 9th, 14th, 23rd, and 30th June, and the 16th instant, the contents of all of which have been read with interest. My object in writing to-day is to advise you that I have had a call from a Mr. Frederick Stokes, of Constantinople—in connection with some other business—and in the course of conversation lie stated :— 1 That the Chester a cheme was actually sanctioned some time ago. 2 . That the Americans he represents are the well known financiers, Plant and Gould, the former of whom was in Constantinople for some months cutting a great dash, and entertaining various members of the Turkish Government on his yacht. 3. That a party of eight engineers are now engaged on the survey of the projected railway on behalf of this American group. 4. That Colt, to whom you referred in your last letter, is to remain in Turkey on behalf of this group to superintend the survey and other operations. 5. That he (Stokes) has personally visited the Agana Copper Mines, and considers that they are of enormous value, and taken into conjunction with the petroleum deposits and the agricultural traffic, fully justify the expenditure of 15 to 20 millions on the railway. 6. That the Turkish Government have favoured the granting of the concession to this group because America has no political interests to serve in Asia Minor. [2817 ^—1]7. That as Plant and Gould are connected with the Standard in other business operations it is possible that the latter are really the deus ex machind of this scheme. The above information, if true, seems to indicate that the Chester scheme has progressed a good deal farther than has been reported to you. Can you ascertain the s- exact facts ? Certainly—if it be true that the group has eight engineers actually engaged on the survey of the line and in examining the mining possibilities—and Colt has (as you state), also started on a journey over the projected route—it would appear as if the Chester scheme has actually been accepted by the Turkish Government. Stokes further mentioned—which is corroborative—that the Americans have sixteen months from January last in which to decide whether or not they will carry out the concession.

The American Ambassador was, as I have informed you, certain that the convention ended, and it seems that definite promises to this effect were made to the promoters.

My American colleague is greatly annoyed, his only crumb of comfort being that he sees the other missions no more successful than himself in obtaining what they desire. It is, he says, an entirely new departure for the State Department to back up the efforts of their capitalists, and consequently they have taken special pains to examine into the whole matter and to satisfy themselves of the genuineness of the enterprise. The embassy are resolved that the matter shall be pushed through ; they are incensed with the Germans rather than with the Turks, for they consider the check to the success of the scheme as entirely due to German machinations, and they intend to retaliate on them in South American domains. They say that there is no trick to which the Germans will not descend, and that, though they cloak their bribery adroitly, yet no more corrupt or corrupting influence could be conceived. Meanwhile, the promoters will not lose their time, but Messrs. McArthur, who are one of the principal of the parties interested, are sending an expert of high reputation, a Mr. Colt, to investigate along the proposed trace, so that they may be better informed by the time the Chamber reassembles. I am inclined to think that the very intervention of the American Embassy has tended to check the progress of the scheme. The Turkish Government seem to be in a frame of mind such that while they might perchance grant a concession of some sort —such as the Mahsousseh—to private concession hunters, yet they will give nothing to anybody, no matter how solid and respectable, who present themselves protected by the recommendation of their embassy and relying on their support. They seem, in fact, to haveji general sort of grudge against foreign embassies, all of which, in their view, used them unkindly under the old regime, and which, under the new, do nothing but check their activity in every direction, pointing out that such and such action is contrary to “ ancient treaties ” and “ agreements in force.” By their present attitude, which is extended in the provinces by the authorities to the foreign consuls, they think they assert their independence and their sovereign prerogatives. would be presented to the Chamber and obtain its sanction during the session recently I have, Ac.

[23951] No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received July 4.) (No. 431.) Sir, Therapia, June 27, 1910. I HAVE the honour to report that at the sitting of the Chamber of the 26th June a convention was voted with the Societe Ottomane du Chemin de Fer Smyrne-Cassaba et Prolongement for the construction and working of a branch line from Soma (sanjak of Magnesia) to Panderma, a port on the Sea of Marmora. The concession is to expire on the same date as the concession for the lines Smyrna-Alashehir, Smyrna-Beyronnabat-Magnesia-Soma and Alashehir-Afioun- Karahissar, all of which lines have been constructed and are worked by the same society. At the expiry of the concession the line Soma-Panderma, together with the other lines above mentioned, shall revert, free of all charge and in good repair, to the Ottoman Government. The society is to furnish plans for the line within one year, and the Ministry of Public Works will then have a period of three months for their approval, modification, or rejection. Work shall be begun one year after the approval of the plans, and should be finished within four years. The Ottoman Government shall give to the company for defraying the cost of construction 77,832 bonds at 4 per cent, of 500 fr. each, redeemable during the term of the concession. The company thus starts with a total nominal capital of 38,916,000 fr., or, the length of the line being estimated at 190 kilom., of 204,800 fr. per kilom. The Ottoman Government undertakes to pay interest and sinking fund on these bonds, but, on the other hand, the company shall guarantee, with all its property, movable and immovable, the services of this interest and sinking fund. The company shall pay interest until the line is working throughout its entire length. The line can be set working by sections of 20 kilom. at a time. The working expenses of the whole line are calculated at 947,670 fr. per annum, or 4,987 fr. per kilom., say, 200L per annum. Working expenses shall be deducted after payment of interest and sinking fund. If during the first ten years the receipts do not cover the working expenses, the deficit will be made good by the Government. The sums required for this purpose will be deducted from the surplus of the revenues affected to the kilometric guarantee of the line Smyrna-Cassaba-Prolongement, or from the general revenues of the budget. These sums will be advanced by the Government, and will carry interest at 4 per cent, in favour of the Treasury, and they will be repaid by the share which the Government will receive later on from the surplus values of the receipts. In this way the Government will have given nothing to the company, but will merely have invested its money at 4 per cent. If the receipts are in excess of the working expenses, the surplus shall be divided equally between the Government and the company. The consideration of this convention gave rise to some discussion in the Chamber. The Opposition was led by Loutfi Fikri Bey, and the chief objection raised was that the estimate of cost of construction (204,800 fr. per kilom.) was excessive. A proposal was also made to modify the convention so as to give the Government an effective control of the works in connection with the railway, but this proposal was dropped. Djavld Bey declared that the estimate of the cost of construction was not excessive. From the figure which appeared in the convention must be deducted costs of expropriation of rolling stock and other preliminary items, and, above all, the cost of issuing the bonds. The price of issue might be influenced by the political situation at home or by a war. In the case of the bonds of the Bagdad Railway loan, with a State guarantee, the price had been fixed at 86 . It might be that in the present instance it would be impossible to get more than 80. This would reduce the real cost of construction to about 160,000 fr. Finally, the Chamber approved the convention by 110 votes to 20. The method of guarantees is analogous to that adopted for the Bagdad Railway. [ 1:817 d —10] L J - COPYThe cost per kilometre is reckoned at 204,800 fr. (or 8,192Z.), and on this interest must be paid at the rate of 4 per cent., i.e., 3,192 fr. (or 488L) per annum. To this must be added the working expenses, which are put approximately at 5,000 fr. per annum, or 13,192 fr. per kilom. per annum. It is cheaper than the Bagdad rate, but there is no difficult country to go through, and the region is rich and fertile. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

I SPOKE to the United States Ambassador to-day on the subject of the American application for a railway concession in Anatolia, which he had mentioned to me the other day. I said that we had no opposition to offer to the concession in general, but that we had for some years been pressing for a concession for a first-rate British firm (Mr. d’Arcy’s) for working the oil-fields of Mosul and Kerkuk. We must, of course, continue to press for this concession; but I did not see that this need necessarily involve opposition to the American concession. I was not sure whether the proposed American mining rights would cover the district for which Mr. d’Arcy was applying ; but, if this were the case, it might be arranged that the American concession should not apply to the oil in that district. I thought it ought to be possible, in this or some other way, to reconcile the concession in which we were interested with the American concession. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

THE United States Ambassador informed me to-day that his Government were supporting at Constantinople an application by Americans for a railway concession in Asia Minor. They learnt that the German Ambassador was opposing their entrance into this field of enterprise, and endeavouring to get support for his opposition from some of his colleagues in the Corps Diplomatique at Constantinople. The United States Government hoped that we would not oppose this railway project on the ground that it was American. They would, of course, be very pleased if we could see our way to go so far as to give them some support, but the Ambassador did not press for this. I asked him if he could tell me exactly what the railway project was, but he replied that he had not been informed by his Government as to this. I said we would certainly not join in any opposition to it because it was American. I would enquire what exactly the project was, but I doubted whether we could give j any active support, for we had lately been concentrating our efforts at Constantinople on trying to get a settlement of railway and irrigation questions in the southern part of Mesopotamia, and it might be difficult for us to endeavour to promote actively any other projects at present.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 13.) (No. 357.) gi r&gt; Therapia, June 4, 1910. THE German Ambassador yesterday told me that, having had on the 2nd instant occasion to enter again a verbal protest to the Grand Vizier regarding that clause in the Mahsousse Concession, which gave to the new company the right to run passenger steamers between Constantinople and the terminus of the Anatolian Railway at Haifar Pasha as being opposed to the Bagdad Railway Convention, his Excellency took an opportunity of stating that he saw with regret that under the new regime the vested interests of foreigners were frequently set aside or ignored. His Excellency cited the case of the Chester scheme, which has formed the subject of several despatches I have had the honour to address to you. Baron Marschall maintained that the scheme, if carried out, would give to the Chester group an exclusive right over 80,000 kilom. in Asia Minor, thereby encroaching on the general mining rights obtained by foreign subjects under the 3 per cent, agreement of 1907 governing the regulations regarding mines sanctioned by Imperial Irade. The Grand Vizier, his Excellency told me, affected great surprise and ignorance of the law in question, and said he would look into the matter. To the astonishment of the Ambassador, in yesterday’s inspired paper, the “ Tanin,” he saw the annexed report of this conversation, and sent a copy of the cutting to the Grand Vizier, who caused the enclosed denial to be promptly inserted and an expression of regret to be sent to him regarding the indiscretion. r Ihe terms of the denial are, to say the least, ambiguous, but the net result of the German Ambassador s move has been that the convention which was before the Council of Ministers, and was about to be sent to Parliament for ratification, has been withdrawn from the Counncil of Ministers and returned to the Ministry of Mines. I had occasion to-day to see the Grand V izier, and asked his Highness what truth there was in the reported conversation. His Highness denied that any such conversation had ever taken place, but I prefer to believe what the Ambassador told me. His Highness merely repeated that he did not much favour such speculative undertakings for a Government. It is generally believed that his Highness has all along not been in favour of the scheme, but that latterly pressure had been brought to bear upon him by the Committee of Union and Progress. He added that the American Ambassador had assured him that the Standard Oil Company had no share in the undertaking. It is difficult to say whether the argument of the German Ambassador is a sound one. Chapter 5, articles 47 to 50 would certainly, under the Chester scheme, appear to have been contravened, or in any case ignored. And the scheme is certainly opposed to the spirit of the regulation.

It is intended later to carry an extension of this railway through the English of the Ottoman Republic, and, while there seems to be considerable competition from American and Belgian sources, I am informed that with sufficient support this concession will be granted to me on behalf of English financiers.

The Russian financial group, which was composed of the establishments which had been officially communicated to me (see my despatch No. 96 of the 20 th February), was to particinate to the extent of 50 per cent, of the capital. The Turkish Government were, however imwilling to grant the concession to a Franco-Russian combination, and had stated that if the railway were to be constructed they themselves would undertake it. To this the Russian Go\eminent could not well take exception, but they would insist that if the Turkish Government were to undertake the work it should be performed with exclusively Turkish funds, and that the capital should not be provided by a loan which would be admitting foreign capitalists m a disguised form into the enterprise. The capital required must, in the view of the Russian Government, be supplied by the Ottoman Treasury or from exclusively Ottoman sources, and the expenses be inscribed on the Turkish budget. Of course the Russian Government would prefer to obtain the concession for the Franco-Russian group, and the opposition of the Turkish Government might possibly be overcome by Russia making some concessions in regard to her preferential rights in other quarters to which such rights extended Such concessions might be found in the districts adjacent to the Bosphorus. The Samsun- I Sivas line was the main object of Russian diplomacy. I asked M. Sazonow, as he was mentioning railway matters, what course the Russian Government proposed to adopt in regard to the Tehran-Khanikin line and whether they intended to icsume conversations with the German Ambassador His Excellency said that he thought that the best plan would be to apply to the Persian Government for the concession for the Tehran-Khanikin line. In present ciicumstances there was not the slightest hope of such a concession being granted but ' it would be well that an application should be lodged. The German Ambassador had just returned from a short visit to Berlin, and presumably was now primed with the necessary instructions to resume the conversations with M. Isvolsky. M. Sazonow said that he had no information as to the lines on which the conversation would proceed. Pei haps M. Isvolsk^, on his return journey through Berlin, might be able to ascertain something.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 194 of the 1st Fehmary last, I have the honour to forward herewith an article from the “ Yeni Gazeta,” giving further news regarding the Chester, Glasgow, and Schaeffer Railway schemes. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1 . Extract from the “ Yeni Gazeta ” of Api'il 12, 1910. The American Railway in Anatolia. IN previous articles we have examined the proposals of Mr. Glasgow, and of Mr. Chester ; and have given our opinion on them. We now wish to look at a further project—that of the Belgian financial group, known as the “ Societe generale ”—the moving spirit of which is Colonel Schaeffer. Let us repeat what we have said in connection with the other schemes, the points and conditions of which we make mention are not necessarily the final ones; indeed, we hear that the Societe generale is about to make further proposals ; but in order to form any logical opinion, we must go into such details as we have. In the petition presented to the Minister of Public Works the Societe generale make the following remarks :— “ The treatment of railways in connection with mines appears to us to be open to grave objections, both on the part of our company and on the part of the Ottoman Government, because the contract made would be based on a value which is unknown to either of the contracting parties, and which would therefore be nothing more than a speculation. As a speculation the business is promising enough to produce a deficit of 5,000Z. Indeed, it is sufficient in the first place to understand the nature of petroleum mines ; if these mines are important and rich enough to guarantee a 2,000 kilom. line, then there is a probability that the Government which owns them will turn out the loser, and not the gainer, for a great and fertile source of wealth will have been taken from it before its true value is known in return for a disproportionately small advantage. The Belgian Societe generale, acting on the rule that all business should be based on sound foundations, does not wish to have anything to do with so vague and proble matical a matter, a matter which, even though it were profitable to the company itself, would cause the Government to be always regretful, and would expose it to hostile criticisms. We wish to propose to the Government an undertaking that will be both advantageous to the Government, and will enable a serious financial company to earn a reasonable and legitimate profit. The Societd generale proposes that the Govern ment shall itself work both mines and railways. The societe will provide the money necessary both for the building of a railway and for the discovery of mines. From the actual revenues a sufficient sum will be appropriated to pay 7 per cent, on the capital, and also to amortise the capital within the period of the duration of the concession. If there be any revenue over it shall be equally divided between the Government and the company. If things go well, this will be a most profitable undertaking, both for the Government and for the company.” We do not know why this proposal should not be acceptable to the Government ; \ but one thing we do know is that a convention is to be made with the Chester group on their making certain modifications ; it remains to be seen what these modifications are, and whether they are open to the objections that we have pointed out in our previous articles.

I HAVE the honour to forward to you herewith a translation of an article which has recently appeared in the Yeni Gazeta,” attacking the proposed Chester Railway concession. I understand that there is more similar criticism to follow, the main objection of the opposers of the scheme being that the real object of its promoters is the oil, but with a view not to its being exploited but to its being worked, so as to prevent it from competing with the products of the Standard Oil Company. It does not appear to be very likely that the Chester scheme will be adopted. The Minister for Public Works, who has shown himself so violently in favour of it, contrary to the opinions of his technical advisers, was subjected to an interpellation in the Chamber on Monday and Tuesday last; the member for Dersim, Lutfi Fikri, led the attack, but he chose his ground ill, and he is lacking in the arts of oratory. The Com mittee of Union and Progress rallied round Halajian Effendi, and his Excellency thus obtained a vote of confidence by a considerable majority. As a result of the struggle, however, there were several defections from the side of the Committee, and though Halajian Effendi has triumphed for the moment, there is a general feeling that he is tottering to his fall. It is shown by the precedents of Kiamil Pasha, Gabriel Effendi and Hussein Hilmi Pasha that such an issue is apt to be attendant on a vote of confidence. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1 . Exti'act from the “ Yeni Gazeta,' of March 20, 1910. The Chester Project. IN previous articles we have discussed various points in connection with American railways in Asia Minor, and in our last article we laid before our readers the proposals of Mr. Chester. And now we wish to give our view on the details of the scheme, for it is most necessary to examine it minutely from every point of view. In our last article we showed what Mr. Chester proposes, and what the Govern ment would have to undertake regarding these proposals. Now we will show what sort of reception they met with at the Ministry of Public Works, and what objections have been put forward to them. The Ministry of Public Works, after examining the scheme, gives the following opinions :— The opinions of which we have received a resume can never be acceptable. In the first place let us remember that owing to our agreement with Russia the line from Sivas to the Black Sea cannot be given to an American financial syndicate ; the line from a point on the gulf of Alexandretta to Diarbekir is equally impossible, owing to the established claims of the Bagdad Railway Company. Moreover, putting aside the agreement with Russia and the Bagdad Railway no line could he built in so haphazard a way. (This refers to the clause “ the concessionnaire shall have the right to carry out any extension or branch line that he shall wish’’). When a new network of railways is to be built, it must, of course, be laid out in accordance with a general plan laid down by the Government and suited to the essential needs of the country. Never did any Government give up all its rights and abandon the scheme for a new network of radways to a third person. Such a course would bring in its train innumerable difficulties. If the concessionnaire wished to build a line from Sivas to Erzeroum and [2710 /— 9] COPY TO Uthen prolong it, and Russia on the strength of the above-mentioned agreement opposed it, what would be the result ? To make up for this line not being built the Govern ment would have to pay a big indemnity to the concessionnaire. Probably the concession hunter has never thought of such difficulties as these. Then as regards the monopoly of navigation on Lake Van this condition is also unacceptable. For, on the 30th October, 1295, this concession was given to Sarahan EfTendi for thirty years, and although the Government opposed it, and then quashed it, the question has again come under consideration, and the concession will under these circumstances certainly not be given to another. Besides these there are a few other absolutely impossible conditions :— 1 . It would be impossible to give to a single concessionnaire the concession for the electric power and lighting in a district of 400,000 square kilom., i.c., a region of the area of France, especially as the concessionnaire is not to be compelled to give even the terms on which he will supply this power and lighting. 2 . Equally unacceptable is the condition to give a monopoly for the irrigation of a region of 80,000 square kilom., i.e., of the area of more than half Bulgaria. 3. A monopoly for the working of quarries could not be given, for this would cause grave difficulties in the matter of road-making and even ordinary building. 4. Impossible also a monopoly in the matter of water-springs found in the district. These claims which we have mentioned are so preposterous that we are astounded to think that the American syndicate could ever have put them forward. However, we think it will he possible to make the syndicate abandon them, even then, we merely get back to the proposals of the Witt syndicate, with this difference however :— The American syndicate will pay the proper taxes on mines, as soon as the mines begin to be worked. But they are only to pay as tax on the ore 6 per cent, of the value of the ore at the time of extraction, and that is to be all; this condition seems to he most dangerous for us. For under our present mining law, the tax on minerals varies from 4 to 20 per cent., according to the different kinds; and oils are subject to 20 per cent, tax; and it is for the sake of the oil-wells that these railways are to be built. That is to say, the present proposals ask for a yearly grant for 14 per cent, of the value of the oils extracted. In other words, if valuable oil mines are discovered, as seems likely, the reductions in taxes to he granted will amount to many times the sum required to amortise the capital expended on building the railway at a reasonable rafe of interest. And other mines than petrol for which the legal tax would be under 6 per cent., will be given by the concessionnaire to a third party to work, so that the Government would receive less than the G per cent, on them. The old regime was criticised for giving kilometric guarantees before deciding the value of a line. The American scheme is open to even more severe criticism, as it means giving definite revenu°s before calculating the value of the lines given in return. If the American syndicate were to undertake definitely to build the line, even so the Government might be compared to a man who has bought a lottery ticket, and who might win if fortune helped him ; but owing to the right of option demanded by the aforesaid syndicate, we may be sure that the line would be built at a time when it would be bad for the Government. We have put forth with absolute impartiality the views of the esteemed members of the Ministry of Public Works. Whatever modifications are hereafter introduced the essentials remain. Nevertheless we will examine the final phase of the question in the same manner. We hear that another concession has been asked for by the Belgian Colonel Schaeffer. When the time comes we will discuss this too.fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government. * .^[ATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. J CONFIDENTIAL. ./^'{February 18.] Section 3.

IN continuation of my letter of the 9th instant, I enclose you herewith a precis of a letter which has just been received by Colonel Massy from our agent at St. Petersburgh in connection with our endeavours to secure the concession of the Samsoun-Sivas Railway. I am, &amp;c. C. EUAN-SMITH. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Dandre to Colonel Massy. (Extract.) Dear Colonel Massy, St. Petersburgh. .... After your departure from St. Petersburgh a certain period of time elapsed during which our business was at a complete standstill owing to the fact that Prince Galitzine was obliged to visit his estates in the country before his departure for London and Constantinople, which necessitated the interview with M. Stolypine being postponed till last Saturday, but since then matters have made great progress. M. Stolypine has given a great deal of attention to our project, and has promised us his support, but he has also judged it necessary that Prince Galitzine and M. Moltchanoff should see M. Isvolsky, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who must necessarily be informed of all that is taking place and all that is intended, as it is through him that our representatives have to enter into relations with M. Charikoff, the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople. In closing the interview with M. Stolypine, the latter said that it would be very desirable that a written memorandum of what was desired should be handed to him, and this was done the next morning by M. Moltchanoff, who, according to trustworthy information which we have received, made a most favourable impression upon the Prime Minister as being the best possible agent for a large affair of this sort. While we were considering the best way to approach M. Isvolsky, Prince Galitzine and M. Moltchanoff received from him on Monday night an invitation to go and see him next day at 3 o’clock. We learnt afterwards that this was due to the initiation of M. Stolypine, who had begged him to see them and to explain the details of our scheme. I cannot give you all the particulars of what passed at this interview, which rendered it evident that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had a very superficial knowledge of the whole subject. However, he is on the point of leaving St. Petersburgh, and our matter will then rest in the hands of the Under-Secretary, who is thoroughly well informed on the whole business On Friday we are to have an interview with the British Ambassador, and we are going to ask him if he will kindly see the Minister of Finance, who, in view of the progress that has been made in the matter, will now be of great importance. According to our first plan Prince Galitzine and M. Moltchanoff intended to leave for London on Friday last, but after consideration we arrived at the conclusion that, before going to Constantinople, it was necessary to know for certain that the assistance of the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople had been secured. We considered that it was better to delay on this side than to be kept for some time at Constantinople while the necessary references were made to head-quarters. We trust that these preliminaries will soon be settled, and that in about two weeks our friends will be able to meet you in London [2710 o—l][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 176 of the 6 th instant, I have the honour to report that Prince Alexander Galitzine and M. d Andre called on me this morning to explain their views and intentions in regard to obtaining a concession for the Samsun— Sivas railway, in which Colonel Massy and others in England are interested. M. d’Andre was the spokesman. He gave me a summary of interviews which he and his associates had had with M. Stolypine and M. Isvolsky.^ It had been explained, he said to M. Stolypine that a purely Anglo-Russian combination for the construction ot a railway of such importance to Russian interests as the Samsun -Sivas li 11 ® w ^ s preferable to the work being entrusted to a group of Russian banks, the Ottoman Bank, and Count Vitalis’ society. The latter group was in reality, M d Andre asserted, entirely under German control, and he had also stated to M. Isvolsky that the Ottoman Bank was merely a succursal of the Deutsche Bank. M. Stolypine, according to M d’Andre, had been much struck with the new light which had been thrown on the combination which at present was being favoured by the Russian Government; and had expressed a wish to have a memorandum on the subject. M. Isvolsky so M. d’Andre informed me, did not appear to be well grounded in the subject, and had adopted a reserved attitude, merely recommending him and his friends to speak to M. Kokowtzoff on the question. Their intentions were to proceed to London shortly, and after having discussed matters in detail with theii English friends, to Constantinople and present a request for the concession. They hoped to obtain the support of the Russian Government and embassy. Such in brief was what M. d Andre told ^ ^ g ent j emen that my Government had asked the Russian Government what group they supported, and I had been given the names of certain establishments which were favoured by the Imperial Government. I understood from them that they expected that the Russian Government would change their views on that point and would be soon induced to support in preference the Anglo-Russian combination in which they were interested. I could not naturally express an opinion on that point, and would await further developments. Our position was extremely simple and plain. We would support any British participation in any group which enioved the support of the Russian Government, but I did not think that we should accord assistance to any combination which did not obtain that support. At present we only knew of one combination which was favoured by the Russian Government. It the latter were to substitute another in its place they would doubtless let us know, and until then we remained passive. . t . I trust that I have correctly interpreted your views on the subject.

I HAD the honour in my despatch No. 148 of the 22nd ultimo to report the visit to this capital of Colonel Massy, who is interesting himself, in conjunction with some Russian gentlemen, in the concession for the Samsun-Sivas Railway. I stated in that despatch that at the suggestion of M. Sazonow I would recommend Colonel Massy to place himself in communication with the Russian banks who were interested in the matter. Colonel Massy was not disposed to entertain this suggestion, and has left St. Petershurgh. A day or two ago M. Andre, one of the Russian co-adjutors of Colonel Massy, called at the embassy and informed Mr. Kidston that M. Stolypin had been persuaded to look with favour on the concession which would be sought for by Colonel Massy and his Russian friends. The latter consist of M. Andre, a Prince Alexander Galitzine, and a M. Molchanoff. M. Andre also stated that these gentlemen were proceeding to London, and would seek an interview with you. I informed M. Sazonow of what had passed, and said that I believed some of the Russian gentlemen would call on me on the 8 th instant. I would like to know whether they were men of substance, whether it was a fact that M. Stolypin was disposed to grant them his protection, and whether the Russian Government would abandon their support to the group which I had been officially informed represented Russian interests. M. Sazonow said that he doubted much whether M. Stolypin took any interest at all in the Samsun-Sivas line ; in any case, he had not mentioned the matter either to M. Isvolsky or to M. Kokowtzoff, which he certainly would have done had he attached any importance to the question. The Russian gentlemen in themselves were not men of sufficient capital to undertake any project of importance. They had called both on M. Kokowtzoff and on M. Isvolsky, and had left the impression on both these Ministers that they should not be taken seriously. They admitted that they had no Russian financial establishments at their backs, and said that they would find all the necessary capital in England. M. Sazonow said that the Russian Government did not at all wish that the whole of the capital should be found abroad, as they were desirous that Russia should have a share in the administration, &amp;c. The group which the Russian Government favoured, and continued to favour, were the Russian banks mentioned in my despatch No. 148, v who were working in connection with the Ottoman Bank, the Regie Generale, and Messrs. Bardac and Le Mornay. M. Sazonow again repeated that he did not believe that any German capital would be employed by the above-mentioned group. . If Colonel Massy and his friends wish to participate m the Samsun-bivas Railway it would be advisable that they should enter into communication with the Russian banks, and not endeavour to act independently of or in opposition to them.

DURING a conversation which I had with M. Sazonow this afternoon, I told him that I received a visit in the morning from Colonel Massy, formerly in His Majesty’s Consular Service, who had spoken to me in regard to a project which he was advocating for an Anglo-Russian combination in the construction of the Samsun-Sivas Railway and of other lines in those parts of the Turkish Empire. In reply to my enquiries, Colonel Massy (who was recommended to me in your despatch, No. 26, Commercial, of the 4th March, and presented a letter of introduction from the Foreign Office) had stated that he had been in communication with some Russian gentlemen of importance in St. Petersburg!! who were anxious to favour his scheme. He had not, he said, seen any high officials, nor had he been in relations with any financial establishments in this capital. I had told him that there already appeared to be at least one syndicate in the field for the Samsun-Sivas Railway, and that this syndicate was composed of the International Bank of Commerce in St. Petersburgh, the Russian Bank for Foreign Commerce, and the Regie generale of Ottoman Railways. This group, I understand, was favoured by the Russian Government, and that His Majesty’s Government would only support a British combination which worked with the group supported by the Russian authorities. I was not, I had told Colonel Massy, quite clear as to the exact composition of the group or groups enjoying Russian support, and I was desirous of having this point elucidated. There was a British Euxine Trading Company, which had been in communication with some Franco-Russian financiers, of whom Rossolato Bey was one, and I was anxious to ascertain whether these latter gentlemen were in combination with the group which I had mentioned, and of which Count Vitalis’s company seemed to be an important member. Colonel Massy has told me that he was connected in fact with this Euxine Trading Company, and that though the Russian Government had in the first instance been disposed to favour Count Yitalis and his Russian associates, he had been “ given to understand ” that M. Stolypine was reconsidering the matter as he had since learnt that the Yitalis combination was in close connexion with the Ottoman and Deutsche Banks, and that the combination was in fact largely a German undertaking. When this had been brought to the knowledge of M. Stolypine, his Excellency had been unwilling to support any combination which would encourage the introduction of German influence into districts of the Turkish Empire which by their geographical situation were of importance to Russian interests. I had told Colonel Massy that I must see my way a little more clearly than I did at present, and that I would take an opportunity of speaking to M. Stolypine and to M. Kokovtzoff, the Minister of Finance, on the subject. I told M. Sazonow that l doubted if M. Stolypine had much knowledge of, or interest in, railways in Asiatic Turkey, but that I presumed that M. Kokovtzoff was well acquainted with the whole subject. I would, however, like to know exactly what group was supported by the Russian Government, as this was a point on which I was in doubt. As to the “Russian gentlemen of importance ” with whom Colonel Massy had been in communication, their names were unknown to me ; and when I asked whether they had any financial backing, Colonel Massy had replied that the project would be financed from London. The whole affair seemed to me somewhat obscure. M. Sazonow said that the group which the Russian Government were supporting was composed of the Baiique internationale de Commerce, of the Banque russe pour le Commerce, and of Count Yitalis’s Regie generale des Chemins de Fer ottomans. He had quite recently seen the president of the Banque internationale, and he had told him that matters were proceeding satisfactorily, and that the Russian banks would furnish 30 per cent of the capital. He had not heard that the Deutsche Bank or any German capital was interested in the project, or that there was any intention.of securing [2679 5J ,German participation. The “ Russian gentlemen of importance were equally unknown to him, and he said that M. Stolypine was not acquainted with the question of Asiatic railways, and that M. Kokovtzoff was the Minister in whose hands such matters were placed. He thought that the best plan would be for Colonel Massy to see M. Kokovtzoff and the president of the Banque internationale and talk over the subject with them. I have, therefore, caused Colonel Massy to be informed that it would be prudent for him to enter into communication with the above-named gentlemen before proceeding further with his scheme.

I Aftf directed by the Secretary of State to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 9th and 13th instant respecting the negotiations carried on at St. Petersburg!! in regard to the concession for constructing the Samsun-Siyas railway. I am to state that the support by His Majesty’s Government of British participation in any group must depend on whether that group is approved by the Russian Government. According to recent despatches from Ills Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, the Russian Government are still supporting a group constituted by the Banque Internationale de Commerce, the Banque Russe pour le Commerce, and the Regie Generale des Chemins de Fer Ottomans. In these circumstances, it would be impossible for the gentlemen named in your letter of the 9th instant to be received at the Foreign Office unless Sir E.

[2710 bb —3] COPY '1 O li\. IA : ; - -lit. I /.til 11 , j :V 111V /q, [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] connection with this subject. Previous to his departure for St. Peters burgh, Count Bench endorff, the Russian Ambassador here, received Colonel Massy and myself, and was good enough to promise us that he would write to the Foreign Minister at St. Petersburgh regarding Colonel Massy’s mission, to which he wished every success. Colonel Massy went to St. Peters- burgh and remained there nearly three weeks. He was successful in forming a group of four or five very highly placed Russian gentlemen, who have combined for the purpose of obtaining the concession of the Samsun-Sivas Railway in combination with the Euxine-Marmora Syndicate. Previous to his departure from St. Petersburgh he had an interview with the Russian Ambassador and told him everything that had taken place, and he understood from his Excellency that he himself would speak to M. Stolypine in this connection as soon as opportunity might offer. Colonel Massy speaks in terms of warm gratitude of the kindness and consideration shown him by his Excellency. Since Colonel Massy’s return we have had a telegram from the Russian gentlemen in question, stating that they had received from M. Stolypine assurances of the support of his Government, and that they had arranged on Wednesday, the 6 th April last, to visit the British Ambassador and to inform him as to what had occurred. The two gentlemen in question, Prince Galitziue (brother of Prince Boris Galitzine), and M. Moltchanoff, who is the head of the Russian commercial fleet, have now telegraphed that they propose arriving in London in connection with this business next week. They will presumably be officially credited to their own embassy in London. They intend, after leaving London, to proceed at once to Constantinople, and to endeavour there by diplomatic agency to obtain the definite granting of the concession for their group and for ours in combination. This is the state of affairs as it exists at the present moment, and if Sir Charles Hardinge or yourself would like to see Colonel Massy to receive from him an account of what had occured, he would at any time call at the Foreign Office. Would you kindly also inform me if the two Russian gentlemen in question would be received at the Foreign Office, their visit of course being arranged through the ordinary official and diplomatic channels.

Foreign Office to Board of Trade. Sir, Foreign Office, April 20, 1910. I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople on the subject of the Mersina-Ad^ft- railway. A suggestion is made in paragraph 6 of the enclosure in this despatch that the large expenditure by the company in 1909 may have been incurred with a view to lowering the market price of the shares, so that British and other shareholders may sell their holdings to the Germans, who are already supposed to control the company by virtue of their existing votes. Originally the company was under the management of an Anglo-French board, sitting at Constantinople. In 1906 His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople stated in the course of a despatch that in December, 1905, Baron de Yendeuvre, the vice- chairman, left Constantinople for Berlin, where, after several interviews with Dr. Zander and Herr Gwinner, acting on behalf of the Anatolian Railway Company and Deutsche Bank respectively, he came to an arrangement by which he undertook to place those \ companies jointly in possession of a sufficient number of ordinary and preference shares of the Mersina railway to command a majority of votes at general meetings of the company. From “ The Stock Exchange Official Intelligence ” it appears that the shares and bonds are all to bearer, and offer therefore no clue as to the ownership. It states however that Herr Arthur von Gwinner of Berlin is president, and C. Testa of Constantinople (presumably Herr von Testa, the German delegate on the Ottoman Debt) is vice-president. In view of the above information, I am to enquire whether there would, in the opinion of the Board of Trade, be any advantage in endeavouring to prevent the Anatolian Railway Company from acquiring such of the shares oi this company as may not already be in their possession.

K. D’Arcy. You will observe that Mr. D’Arcy considers it probable that the concessionnaire will endeavour to introduce modifications into the convention with a view to reducing his obligations in respect of railway construction, and I request that your Excellency will use your influence, whenever possible or requisite, in opposing any relaxation of obligations in this sense. With reference to the last paragraph of Mr. D’Arcy’s letter, if your Excellency is unable to obtain the whole concession desired by Mr. D’Arcy, you should strongly « support his representative in his endeavours to obtain the concession for oil-fields in Mesopotamia not embraced in the Chester concession, and including the sole right to build and work pipe-lines. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. [2710 t—l] 2 ? *7■i V [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.] I HAVE to thank you for your letter of the 2nd instant advising me of the contents of a despatch dated the 15th r March which has been received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople reporting the gist of a conversation which had taken place between him and the Grand Vizier on the subject of the Chester scheme. and by the Grand Vizier. This is not surprising, because, from the point of view of the Government, it appears to be an extraordinarily favourable proposal, but I cannot imagine that there is any intention on the part of Chester or his financial supporters to deal seriously with the railway part of the proposition, as I find, on reading the draft agreement, of which I have received a copy, that it involves an expenditure of at least 10 , 000 , 000 Z. to 12 , 000,0001 without the least prospect of any remunerative return, and a delay of fully ten years before the concessionnaire will be able to avail himself of the benefit of the mineral rights so far as they apply to the known deposits of copper and petroleum. # . Therefore it appears to me impossible that the concession as now drafted will be acceptable to the Chester group, seeing that they have openly stated that the object they have in view in this scheme is not the building of a railway, but the securing of the mineral rights, and more particularly those for petroleum. This being so, I quite anticipate that before the concession is finally agreed to important modifications may be suggested, and I shall therefore feel very much obliged if you will draw Sir Gerard Lowther’s attention to this point, and indicate to him that, though the Chester scheme in its present form does not seem to encroach very seriously upon the concession for exploiting the oil-fields of Mesopotamia which has already been promised to me, yet that before it is carried through modifications may be introduced with a view to reducing the obligations of the concessionnaire in respect of railway construction, and that any such modifications should be strenuously opposed. . . . In the meantime, I am instructing my representative to proceed with negotiations for a concession for the oil-fields of Mesopotamia, exclusive of such territory as may be comprised in the Chester concession should the option under that concession be exercised, and including the sole right to build and work pipe lines. ^ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

Per a, March 21, 1910. to transmit to you herewith a copy of the draft contract between Mr. Chester and the Ottoman Government which has now received the approval of the Ministry of Public Works. Railway concession so involved. Construction is to be commenced at Youmourtalik, where a port will be established, whence the line will run up the valley of the Jihun, where it will branch off to Sivas on the west and Bitlis on the east, passing Harput, Argana, and Diarbekir, whilst a further branch will carry it vi&amp; Mosul and Kerkuk to Suleimanieh. A period of fourteen months is allowed within which the preliminary surveys are to be made, and the option of constructing the line taken or refused. In the latter case, the caution money, which is fixed at £ T. 20,000, is to be repaid to the concessionnaires in return for the surveys ; in the former, it is to be increased to £ T. 100,000. The Turkish Government are to give no concession affecting the scope of the present contract during the said period of fourteen months; disputes between the concessionnaire and the Turkish Government are to be decided by the Council of State, and, while the contract requires approval by law, the concessionnaire will have no right to compensation if the Turkish Government refuse to ratify it. The line is to be single, but is to be doubled as soon as the average^ annual gross receipts per kilometre amount to 30,000 fr. There is to be no kilometric guarantee, but the concessionnaire is to have the right to work the mines situated within 20 kilom. of either side of the line, enjoying the right of expropriating the proprietors of existing mines (article 6) at their own cost under the conditions laid down by law. Six per cent, of the value of the minerals extracted will be paid ^ to the Turkish Government. A formula is laid down in article 30 fixing the annuity with which the concessionnaire is to provide for the working expenses of the line and for the port, and the next charge upon the income of the undertaking is an interest charge calculated at 5 per cent, upon the cost of the building of the line. If the total receipts of the line are insufficient to meet these two charges, the deficit will be paid in the first place out of the 6 per cent, from the mines accruing to the Turkish Government, and in the second place out of money provided^ by the company ; but but the sums so paid will only be paid at an advance, bearing interest at 5 per cent., and must be repaid from subsequent profits of the line. A scale m fixed for the division of profits, accruing after these charges have been met, by which the share of the Turkish Government increases, and that of the company similarly decreases,, as the profits grow larger. Provision is made for the repurchase of the line by the Turkish Government on the basis of the net annual proceeds of the previous fRe years, provided it be not less than 5 per cent, of the cost of construction. The sum thus arrived at is to be paid annually to the company until the expiry^ of the concession, as otherwise the Turkish Government can capitalise the payments into a lump sum on a 1 6 You will further notice that the entire route is to be laid down and approved before a commencement can be made of mining operations (article 21), and though mining may be begun as soon as the route is approved, yet the minerals extracted may not be removed till the railway is working in the section in which the mine is situated. These provisions should be sufficient to prevent the concessionnaires from carrying the line hither and thither at their w ill in search of remunerative mines. ^ So far as I am able to ascertain, the trend of opinion both m the public and the Chamber, from having been suspicious and almost antagonistic, is now much more favourable to the concession. Mahmoud Shevket Pasha told me that he considered it was better for Turkey to have railways even under severe conditions than none at all. But it is certain that the proposals will have a troublous time before they arrive at a On perusal you will observe that the scheme is of a fairly simple and straight forward character, and devoid of the complicated conditions which render the Bagdad [2679/-2] BI This Docu m ent is the Pro perty of His_ Britannic Majesty's Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

In its comments the paper urges the need for careful deliberation and thought before anv decision is arrived at. It further states that the concessionnaire only asks at present lor permission to undertake surveys and exploration for fourteen months, during which time no concession shall be granted by the Government which would infringe on anv which the company are now proposing to obtain. There are two special points on which the concessionnaires would meet with considerable difficulties, namely they won d be forced to come to an arrangement with private owners of mines with a view to acquiring their rights, and with the Anatolian Railway Company for the rioffit to cross their line. . j r j iu It appears that the technical section of the Ministry of Public Works was altoo-ether opposed to the concession, and presented several reports condemning it, but Haladpan -httench was strongly m favour of it and anxious to grant it, and that he succeeded in overriding his departmental advisers. The scheme of course still has to run the ■ gauntlet of the Council of Ministers, and then of the Chamber.

I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. [2679 o-3][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] discussed with me at an interview I had with you last week. The replies in effect are as follows :— 1 . That the Minister of Public Works has no knowledge of the existence of any combination between the Glascow and Chester interests. 2. That the Minister supports the Chester scheme as being the most favourable presented hitherto. 3. That the Minister states that official assurances have been received from the Government of the United States as to the financial stability of the Chester group. 4. That Chester has never mentioned Mr. D’Arcy’s name at Constantinople. 5. That Sir G. Lowther considers that the chances of the Chester scheme are at present remote. In regard to 1, 2, and 4, I beg to explain that Mr. D’Arcy’s reasons for supposing that Glascow and Chester are working in combination, and that Mr. D’Arcy’s name has been used in connection with this scheme, are :— 1 . That in an interview between Mr. D’Arcy’s representatives and the Minister on the 28th January, at which date Chester was in Constantinople and Glascow in London, the latter said :— “ I am quite sure, and I have proof in hand, that Chester has immense capital at his disposal and is backed by high standing financiers.” Immediately afterwards he remarked :— “ I have received a telegram from Glascow announcing that he has found the necessary capital,” and then went on to discuss these proposals as if he regarded them as one. 2. That Prince Ibrahim, who is working in conjunction with Glascow, had during the past couple of months been making strenuous endeavours to induce Mr. D’Arcy to support his scheme, and has been indicating that the other financial support he was hoping to get was dependent upon Mr. D’Arcy agreeing to join in the scheme. This is merely by way of explanation. But, whether Glascow and Chester are working for the same or different interests, the Anatolian Railway concession as at present formulated, i.e., in combination with the petroleum rights for 10 or 20 kilom. on each side of the proposed railway, would, Mr. D Arcy considers, be an encroachment upon his claims to the oil concession for the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad, and consequently he would feel much obliged if His Majesty s Minister can be requested to represent this view of the matter to the Turkish Minister of Public W orks before his negotiations in regard to the railway concession are carried any further. This is the more desirable inasmuch as the Chester proposals are being favourably considered by the Minister of Public M orks, and will, unless a protest is made at the present stage, presumably be placed before the Ottoman Parliament as soon as the Bill to which you refer becomes law. _ -» i 1 * A I a ■W-WT yvywlT- fl /''l T - /“'V Mr Nichols, to whom vou granted an interview last week has returned to Constantinople, and will on his arrived represent Mr. D’Arcy’s views as above to the ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

[2643 y—3] S' /$ ^ Ay/o[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] /3 * WITH reference to my telegram No. 27 of to-day’s date, I have the honour to forward herewith an article from the “ Yeni Gazeta ” on the subject of Messrs. Glasgow and Chester’s railway schemes. THE press has up to now not paid sufficient attention to these American schemes. But in view of the importance of the subject, and of the fact that Mr. Chester s scheme is now being examined by a special committee of Ministers, it would be as well to discuss it a little. i j j x xt. During Nouradounghian’s ministry Mr. Glasgow put forward a demand tor me concession of various lines:— . , , 1 . From Sivas to Van, passing Kharput, Argam, Diarbekir, Biths, and the north or south side of Lake Van. * , 2. From a point to be decided on the Sivas railway to I imourtalik, down the Djihan valley. 3. From a point on the Diarbekir line to Mosul, Kerkuk, and Suleimameh. Chester’s scheme in our opinion is merely a continuation of this. The Americans will build the lines without kilometric guarantee, but they demand the right to work all mines 20 kilom. on each side of the railroad ; and these mines are, with the exception of the copper mine at Argani, all petroleum. That is, the Standard Oil Company wants to lay its hands on these mines, not to work them, but to prevent others working them, and spoiling their monopoly. Thus, under the idea that we were only getting a railroad without guarantee, we should be saving the Standard Oil Company from the danger facing it, the danger that some other company should work our mines and undersell the Standard Oil Company. We hope that the Munster of Public Works has realised this. Apart from this, we are inclined to regard these schemes as a monster speculation : we can hardly take as serious the proposal to build a railway, costing perhaps 20 000,000L, in a country which the promoters have had so little time to survey. We will leave this side of the question for another article. As Mr. Chesters plan differs very slightly from Mr. Glasgow’s, our remarks on the latter may equally well apply to the former.

J 0. I he technical commission left Constantinople for Samsoun on the 15th Novem- rei last, and left the coast immediately for the interior, in order to get as much of the survey work done on the highlands of Sivas before the snow came. The commission, at the head of which is a M. Dumas, was formed into two parties after leaving Tokat’ one party to survey the road over the Tchamli-Bel pass on to Yeni Han and Sivas’ the other to work m a westerly direction to Zileh, by way of Soulu-Serai to Yeni Han and Sivas. I he two parties had met at Sivas, and were to return coastwards yesterday, making surveys of the road from Zileh via Amasia to Samsoun. It is expected that the commission will not reach that port before the middle of February. 1. I he Regie geneiale lias, according to i\Ir. ihomson, made the necessary arrangements for interesting Russian capital in the enterprise, and these arrangements have been concluded with the Banque russe de ITndustrie et de Commerce, which perhaps may really be the Banque russe pour le Commerce etranger, a branch of which has recently been opened here. The Russian interest will not be a large one, but is sufficient to have disarmed any opposition which the Russian Government might have offered to the undertaking, and to create a lively interest in the project in Russian official circles. Before leaving Constantinople for Samsoun, M. Dumas had several interviews with M. Tcharikoff, who gave him letters for the Russian consul at Samsoun. The latter has been in constant touch with the commission, and the Russian Embassy receives regular reports of all the doings of the commission. Mr. Thomson has seen the Russian Ambassador, who seemed most interested in all the information Mr. Thomson could give him, and has urged an early visit to Paris, as it was most important no time should be lost in getting the concession. Mr. Thomson informed he had received instructions since his return from Samsoun to leave for Paris at once, and he consequently leaves to-morrow. Both the Turkish as well as the Russian Governments seem to be very anxious to begin the vrork of constructing the line as soon as possible ; the Regie generale had not intended carrying out the surveys before next spring, but the urgency shown by [2574 m—1] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA [January 12 .] CONFIDENTIAL.

The Turkish project is that the line should be one of a metre-gauge, and the^ Russians favour that idea, as there seems to be some objection on their part to thf ^ possibility of the Samsoun Radway being joined on to the Anatolian system at an^ future time. The Regie generale hope to induce the Government to allow them to put down a normal gauge line, and the surveys are being made both for a narrow as well as for a normal gauge. . . 6 . The concession will only be for a railway from bamsoun to bivas, but it is expected that arrangements will be made to obtain authorisation to build an extension to Kharpout, and branches from Amasia to hiarsivan, 1 chorum, and perhaps to Yozgat. &lt; . 7 . No kilometric guarantee is to be given, and the construction or the port oi Samsoun is to be included in the concession. M.

I understand the Regie generale hope to obtain the port concession on terms somewhat similar to those granted to the Beyrout Port and Quay Company. . Negotiations have been proceeding for some time past, and these will be actively continued by M.

M. Tcharikoff said that Dr. Rossolato was a Russian subject, and the lawyer who usually took charge of the interests of Russian subjects in their relations with the embassy. Early last October Dr. Rossolato had enquired what the attitude of the embassy would be to the proposed scheme in which he hoped to interest the National Bank of St. Petersburgh. M. Tcharikoff had replied that he was generally in favour of the scheme, but he would give no definite answer until he knew the views of the Minister of Finance, whose permission was requisite before Russian capital could be invested abroad ; since then he had heard no more from Dr. Rossolato, from which he concluded that the National Bank (M. Tcharikoff seemed rather doubtful as to the name of the bank, as he also called it the “ International ” and the “ Commercial ”) had not taken any very 7 favourable view of the proposal, nor had his own report to the Minister of Foreign Affairs elicited any instructions. Rossolato Bey was at one time legal adviser to the department of mines and forests ; he possesses no capital of his own.

AVE the honour to report that the “Novoe Yremya’’ publishes to-day an article on proposed railway construction in Turkey, of which the following 'is a summary :— „ “ wlll . 1 not on general significance for Russia of this or that tendency of iurkish railway policy, but will content ourselves with recounting, as an example, the history of the Anatolian Railway. While the strategic importance of this line was clear to everybody in Russia, few thought out seriously the results which its con struction^ mighty entail on Russian commerce. Since its construction, the demand in Constantinople for Russian flour and live-stock has declined The construction of new lines towards the Persian Gulf will have even more influence on Russian trade with the Middle East, and it is therefore necessary to make arrangements before they are built. ^ It must be regretted that the policy of Russia towards Turkish railway con struction has hitherto been hostile. AYe are now reaping the fruits of that policv. When the Bagdad Railway was projected in 1903 Russia and England adopted an unfortunate attitude. The realisation of the original plan would have been far more advantageous to the interests of France, Russia, and England, and to Russian commerce in particular. Judging by latest news from Constantinople, Russian policy in regard to railway construction would seem to have changed, and to be taking a course more in accordance with Russian commercial interests, and more likely to strengthen neighbourly relations with Turkey. As regards the renewed proposal for the construction of a narrow-gauge line between Samsun and Sivas, it is to be hoped that the question will be settled in a manner consonant with Russian as well as with Turkish interests. The joining of Sivas with the sea by a direct line will give the cheapest possible outlet for the agricultural produce of the region, and its significance for Turkey is therefore obvious ; but for Russia its significance is not so simple. The new route will create a 1 rivalry in the Black Sea between the produce of north-eastern Anatolia and that of south Russia and the western Caucasus, and it will also facilitate the introduction of foreign goods into lurkey, and subsequently into Persia. These inevitable disad vantages will be partially balanced by the introduction of Russian capital and labour into the building of these new lines and the creation of a new market for Russian iron and coal. The participation of Russian financiers in the construction of railways in Asia Minor is of equal importance, both politically and economically, and the Russian Government is bound to take all steps within its power to assist Russian financial groups in participating actively in Turkish enterprise. But the Government must not risk one rouble from the Treasury. We have already sowed hundreds of millions of roubles in Asia, and have reaped war, sedition, hatred, and the necessity of further heavy sacrifices.” 1 have, &amp;c. A.

The department examines these applications, and on its advice the Government accept or reject the proposals made. Mr. Marling does not see what useful purpose could be gained by referring these applications to the Financial Commission, whose duties are other than those connected with public works. Moreover, the various departments are sensitive on the question of ministerial responsibility, and the Minister of Public Works has on several recent occasions resented the interference even of the Grand Vizier in matters affecting his department.

Mr. Marline/ to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 28.) (No. 976.) Sir, Constantinople, December 17, 1909. 0]S receipt of your despatch No. 337 of the 27th October last, I caused enquiries to be made here regarding the alleged intention of the Turkish Government to create a petroleum regie in this country. Up to the present, I have been able to obtain no information in confirmation of the existence of any such intention on the part of the Turkish Government, nor has Mr. Nichols, the agent of the D’Arcy group, been able to hear anything of such a scheme at the Ministry of Mines. It appears to me inconceivable that so important a matter should not have been talked about and become known if the Government had serious intentions of creating a monopoly, and had gone so far as to make certain proposals to Mr. Lane’s firm. It is generally known that the Turkish Government hope to create certain monopolies, i.e., on matches, petroleum, spirits, &amp;c., but no steps have been taken up to the present to bring about negotiations, and had the Government shown any disposition to discuss these questions, they would most certainly by now have been overwhelmed with proposals from the Standard Oil Company and from Russian as well as from Roumanian companies. Mr. Lane gives no particulars in the letter which forms the enclosure to your despatch under reply, as to who is his agent here or as to whom he has been treating with, and he does not appear to me to be very serious. With regard to Mr. Lane’s references to the alleged intention of the Standard Oil Company to acquire interests in the Turkish Empire, I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a memorandum drawn up by Mr. Weakley, from which it may be seen that the Standard Oil Company have apparently no intention to ask for the monopoly of the sale of petroleum in the Empire, but are merely endeavouring to obtain municipal authorisation in various cities in this country to introduce the sale of petroleum in bulk. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Weakley respecting the Standard Oil Company s Operations in Turkey. A MR. CAMPBELL, travelling agent of the Standard Oil Company, came to Constantinople nearly a year ago, and has since made frequent visits to Smyrna, Salonica, and has also been to Beirout. It has been ascertained that the object of his visit is connected with a scheme the Standard Oil Company have in view of developing the sale of American oil in this country. In order to reduce the cost of petroleum and give facilities to the public, it is proposed to import oil in bulk, which will be stored in large tanks on the sea-shore. The oil will then be distributed and sold to the public by means of small iron tank carts, which are to circulate through the streets, and thus every householder will have the facility of purchasing the quantity of oil necessary for daily requirements at a moderate cost, instead of incurring the expense of buying the more costly petroleum, which is put up in tins. It is understood that the Standard Oil Company have no intention of asking for the monopoly of sale of petroleum in the country, but are simply endeavouring to obtain the necessary authorisation which lies within the powers of municipal authorities to grant for introducing the sale of petroleum in bulk. [2546 ee —4]Mr. Campbell has been trying for some time past to obtain permission to commence work in Constantinople, but has not, so far, been able to make much headway. He had selected a convenient site for erecting oil tanks at Macrikeuy, one of the suburbs at Stamboul, on the Marmora. Owing, however, to the piece of land which he had chosen being in close proximity to the Government cartridge factories, the militar^; authorities have strongly objected to its being used for the purpose of storing ; petroleum. No other convenient site on the sea-shore has so far been found, so that the scheme, as far as Constantinople is concerned, is at present at a standstill. Mr. Campbell’s negotiations with the municipal authorities at Smyrna seems to have been more successful, and it is reported that he has received permission for commencing work there. The site selected for the oil tanks is situated on the northern shore of the Gulf of Smyrna, and lies between the village of Cordelio and Agia Triada. Mr. Campbell seems sanguine that he can commence building tanks and the necessary jetties as soon as convenient. His efforts to obtain a suitable piece of ground at Salonica, as well as permission from the municipal authorities there, have hitherto been unsuccessful. Mr. Campbell is at present in Smyrna, where he is giving all his attention to the carrying out of his scheme in that town.

[December 6 .J CONFIDENTIAL. Section 5. [44347 J No. 1 . Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 6.) (No. 931.) Sir, Constantinople, December 1, 1909. MR. NICHOLL, Mr. W. K. D’Arcy’s representative in this capital, has called several times of late at this embassy to complain of the delay of the Turkish Govern ment in coming to a decision respecting the grant of a concession for the exploitation of the Mosul and Bagdad petroleum fields, and at his request I have twice mentioned the matter to the Grand Vizier. Hilmi Pasha, who professes to be friendly to the D’Arcy proposals, admitted at once that Mr. Nicholl is being hardly treated, but said that the Government could take no decision until the question of the concession for the railway from Yuinurtalik to Mosul and Kirkuk, with mining rights along its route, had been disposed of. (This is, as you are aware, the project first originated by Mr. Glasgow, and a statement of the actual position of the scheme will be found in Mr. Weakley’s memorandum enclosed in my despatch No. 929 of the 22nd November.) The Govern ment, his Highness said, regretted the position, but their hands were tied by the deci sion of the Senate taken last August, which instructed the Ministry to examine the scheme with a view to granting a concession for it; and therefore, until the project had been definitely rejected, it was impossible to come to any settlement with Mr. Nicholl. In answer to a further question of mine, the Grand Vizier assured me that there was no intention to put up the concession for “ adjudication.” In reply to a further ques tion of mine, Hilmi Pasha stated also that in his opinion the Anatolian Railway Company’s claim to an option for the petroleum rights in these districts was untenable, and Aristidi Pasha, Minister of Mines and Forests, has expressed himself to me emphatically in the same sense. Mr. D’Arcy’s representative here is quite positive that, whatever they may have been, the German rights to the petroleum concession have entirely lapsed ; but, on the other hand, Dr. Gwinner has expressed himself to Mr. Edwin Whittall with equal certitude in the opposite sense ; it has therefore seemed to me worth while to try to ascertain what are the real facts of the case. Unfortunately the records in the archives of the embassy are anything but conclusive, and the following brief sketch is based on information derived from Mr. Nicholl, the references to despatches from the embassy merely denoting that an allusion to any particular event will be found in the report referred to. On the l*)th July, 1904, an agreement was signed (copy enclosed in Mr. Townley’s despatch No. 837 of the 28th October, 1908), between Dr. Gwinner and the Civil List, which provided that the Anatolian Railway Company should send a technical com mission to examine the petroleum fields in the Mosul and Bagdad vilayets, and should, in the event of the commission’s report proving favourable, conclude a convention for the creation of a company to exploit them, the option being open for one year, a period subsequently to be extended to two years. The commission, which, according to Mr. Nicholl, was in reality composed almost entirely of railway engineers, and in no sense an expert body, returned in the summer of 1905 (Sir N. O’Conor’s No. 563 of the 6th August, 1905), but sent in no report except some notes furnished to them by a German mining engineer in the service of the Civil List, nor did the Anatolian railway company make any proposals for the formation of^a company as provided in the agreement of 1904. Early in the following year (Sir N. O’Conor’s No. 184 of the 20th March, 1906), however, the Civil List, being in want of money, invited the railway company to take up the option on precisely the terms then submitted by Mr. D’Arcy, but the Germans declined the offer, either because they had not the requisite capital, as Mr. Nicholl asserts, or, as seems to appear from Sir N. O Conors account, because they believed that their rights of either option or preference were perfectly secured to them. According to Mr. Nicholl’s contention, by refusing this offer the Germans lost their right of preference on equal terms conferred by the last article of the 1904 agreement, nor did they, he asserts, keep alive their right ot option bv themselves making any proposition for the formation of a company to acquire this concession definitely ; but this latter point is, I understand, denied by Dr. Gwinner. The two years of the option having expired, the Civil List informed the railway [254G f—5jcompany that their rights had lapsed, to which Dr. Gwinner at once replied by a formal protest stating that the company had made proposals for the formation of a-x company (I cannot ascertain the date of the alleged steps) and that the Civil Lis«x had taken no notice of it, so that as the failure to form a company was attributable to ' the Civil List, not to the German company, the latter still possessed its right of option. The issue would thus^appear to hang in great measure on a point of fact, namely, whether the Anatolian Railway did or did not within the two years specified approach the Civil List with proposals to form a concessionnaire company, and on this point the only evidence, and that very inconclusive, that I can find in the embassy’s archives is Selim Pasha’s letter to Sir H. D. Wclft* (enclosure in your despatch to Sir N. O’Conor’s No. 231 of the 14th June, 1907), which states that the firman in favour of the Germans was still in force ; but it must be remembered that Selim was Minister of Mines and at that time the petroleum fields of the two vilayets belonged to the Ministry of the Civil List. As to the probabilities of a general character, it may be said that it seems most unlikely that Mr. D’Arcy would be maintaining an agent here for the purpose of obtaining the concession if he knew that another party had prior rights to that concession ; hut then again it is equally hard to believe that a keen and business man like Dr. Gwinner should have neglected to preserve the German company’s preference rights to so valuable a property. We are, however, still in the dark as to the German version of the story of the 1904 agreement and its sequel, and I shall endeavour to obtain more detailed and accurate information on the subject.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 929 of the 22nd ultimo, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Beirout reporting the arrival at Tripoli of M. Piersin, the chief engineer of the Damascus- Hama and Prolongement Railway Company, to start work on the new Tripoli-Homs line. The convention for this concession was signed here on the 30th October last, but I have so far been unable to obtain a copy of it. The Imperial firman sanctioning the convention has not been published yet, but the company have summoned a meeting to discuss the raising of capital for working expenses here on the 14th instant. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure in No. 1. Consul-General Cumberbatch to Mr. Marling. (No. 79.) Sir, Beirout, November 25, 1909. WITH reference to my despatch No. 17, Confidential, of the 16th February, on the subject of the Tripoli to Homs Railway scheme, I have the honour to report the arrival at Tripoli of M. Piersin, the head engineer of the Damascus-Hama and Prolongement Railway Company, and his assistants, to commence operations on the new branch line from Tripoli to Homs in accordance with the concession accorded to the Damascus-Hama and Prolongement Railway Company, the particulars of which are, I believe, known at His Majesty’s Embassy. M. Piersin, who superintended the building of the Rayak-Aleppo line, has expressed a hope of being able to commence the construction work proper in about two months, and to complete the railway in eighteen months to two years if he is not hindered in any way. It is said that the company, instead of linking Tripoli with Homs direct, will try to connect it with Kusseir, the last station but one on the Rayak-Homs section, to save about 20 kilom. It is to be supposed that the company will make Tripoli the outlet for the extra traffic of the overburdened narrow-gauge cog-wheel line between Royak and Beirout, which will automatically increase with the agricultural development of the country, and though the building of the new line has been reluctantly taken in hand by the company, it will probably be eventually found of great use in relieving their present line to Beirout, whose limited carrying capacity has already been reached. As the company is also interested in the Beirout harbour, and as the narrow- ’ gauge cog-wheel line from Beirout to Rayak does not enjoy any kilometric guarantee, it is natural to suppose that it will do its best to prevent the Tripoli-Homs Railway from seriously injuring these two concerns by extracting the utmost benefit it can from the kilometrically guaranteed Rayak-Homs-Aleppo section by a reduction of rates. The present sanctioned rates are 35, 30, and 25 paras per kilometric ton, but for whole waggons special rates can be quoted and other devices resorted to to make the transport from Aleppo and the intermediate stations to Beirout almost as cheap as to Tripoli.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 29.^ (No. 929.) Sir Pera, November 22, 1909. I HAL E the honour to transmit herewith a memorandum by the commercial attache to tins embassy dealing with certain points raised in the enclosure to your despatch Nof'302 of the 24th September last, showing the position in which the nego tiations for the various railway concessions in the Empire stand at the present moment. In the body of the memorandum Mr. Weakley calls attention to a recent communique from the Ministry of Commerce and Public Works announcing that in future applicants for concessions must send in with their proposals evidence of their capacity from a financial point of view to carry out the scheme for which they are tendering, and that failing such evidence the application will be ignored. I venture to suggest that it would be expedient to give publicity in England to this requirement of the Turkish Government. I ha\e, * c har;les MARLINa Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum by Commercial Attache' to British Embassy in Turkey. WITH further reference to the enquiry from the Board of Trade, contained in their despatch of the 14th September, copy of wdiich was enclosed in the Foreign Office despatch No. 302 of the 24th September, 1909, concerning the proposals which had been put before the Turkish Government by two American subjects, Messrs. Glasgow and Chester, for the construction of a system of railways in Asia Minor starting from Yumourtalik, in the Gulf of Alexandretta, nothing of any note has transpired to materially change the situation as reported in the last despatch on the subject, No. 851 of the 15th ultimo. From recent information obtained at the Public Works Department, it appears that both Chester and Glasgow have, so far, been unable to satisfy the department that the respective syndicates which they represent are in a financial position sufficient to carry out the undertakings they have proposed. The demands which have been put forward by these two persons are not therefore considered serious by the department, and have been practically put aside for the moment. The felgian syndicate, on wdiose behalf Colonel Schaeffer has applied for a railway concession, the details of which are practically identical with those in Glasgow’s scheme, is considered quite sound by the Ministry, but it appears that no further steps have been taken by Schaeffer at the department, and consequently the negotiations are at a standstill. In view of the numerous applications for concessions wdiich the Public W orks Department has received from various persons who seem to have no financial standing nor any technical knowledge for carrying out the work they ask for, the department has decided in future to reject all applications that may be made by persons wdio are unable to give proof of their tinancial and technical ability to carry out the undertakings or concessions for which they may apply. An official notice from the Public Works Department, published in the local press of the 16th instant, of wdiich a copy is enclosed herewith, states that all applications which do not conform to the required conditions set forth, will in future be ignored A notification is further made in the same communique to all applicants whose demands are now in the possession of the department, to the effect that they must furnish the department with necessary proof of their financial capacity, at latest by the 1st (14th) December, 1909, other wise their applications wdll not be considered. It is expected that, in view of this recent official measures and notification that some of the present applicants, Glasgow amongst others, will probably drop out, but I w r as informed that, as the scheme first propounded [2489 3]by Glasgow has been adopted as a basis for negotiation by Parliament, and the Govern ment has been empowered to treat with applicants for this particular concession (see Embassy despatch No. 783 of the 25th September, 1909, enclosing copy of decree of the Senate), the Department is open to negotiate with any serious syndicate whir 1- ^ might wish to come forward. V I ascertained that a Prince Hassan and Colonel Gordon, both acting on behalf of the Ethelburga Syndicate, had been to the Ministry, and had expressed the desire of applying for the concession, but had not at the time put in a formal demand. Tripoli-Homs Railway. —Attempts have been made at various times during the last four years by a certain Mustapha Izzeddin Effendi, a prominent merchant of Tripoli in Syria and a large shareholder in the local Tripoli-Homs-Hama Road and Diligence Company (“ Shirket-i-Vatani4 ”) to change the road and diligence concession for one for a railway between Tripoli and Homs. In consequence of Izzeddin’s action in the matter, the French Company, the Soci^td de Chemin de Fer de Damas-Homs et Prolongement, felt it necessary to intervene, and were obliged, unwillingly it is thought, to put forward their preferential rights, and to insist on the concession being given to them. As a result of negotiations which have been spread over the greater I part of a year, the concession for this short branch line, which will link up the main line at Homs with the sea-coast at Tripoli, has been finally granted to the French socidt^. The convention, a copy of which I have so far been unable to obtain, was signed on the 30th October last ; the concession is for eighty-eight years, and its date of expiry is fixed so as to coincide with the date of expiry of that of the main line (Aleppo-Rayak). It is to be of normal gauge (1’44 metre), and will be about 100 kilom. in length, and will, it is understood, take about two years in building. No kilometric guarantees have been granted, and it is presumed the railway company wdll take over all the rights and material of tlie “ Shirket-i-Vatanib ” of Tripoli. A general meeting of the societe has been convened in Paris fur the 14th of next month, w 7 hen the new convention will be discussed and measures will be taken for providing the funds necessary for the construction of the branch line. Homs-Bagdad Railway Project. —I was informed at the Ministry that the Depart ment had decided in favour of the building of a railway to Bagdad, taking Homs or Damascus as the starting-point. The report on the subject has been forwarded to the Porte, and will be submitted to the Council of Ministers. Hodeida-Sana a Railway Project. —The concession for this railway was applied for by a certain Elie Leon Bey, of Paris, and negotiations terminated in the drawing up of a preliminary convention. In view, however, of the bill which was passed by the Chamber regarding this concession, and which was reported in despatch No. 686 of the 23rd August last, the Department of Works decided to send a special technical com mission to survey the proposed “ tracee” and to prepare estimates of the probable cost of construction. The commission has already left for Hodeida and will, it is expected be aw r ay some considerable time. The estimates and plans which are to be furnished by this commission, will eventually form the basis upon which the department will ask for tenders. I was given to understand that Leon Bey w r ould enjoy preferential rights on equal terms, but the Government are determined to secure the best possible conditions for building this line. The Government, however, recognise the fact, that in view 7 of the many years which must elapse before such a railway could be made remunerative, it would be impossible to induce capitalists to embark in such an enterprise without some form of guarantee being given on the capital outlayed. The construction of this railway is, however, of the utmost importance to the Government both from the economical as w 7 ell as from the military point of view, and the question of granting a guarantee has been fully admitted in principle. No decision has yet been come to as to the form this guarantee should take, but it is supposed that an annual guaranteed interest on the capital will be the one which w 7 ill find most favour, and, doubtless, the merits of the various tenders, will be judged, apart from other considerations, in great measure by the rate of interest the applicants will be prepared to accept. Samsoon-Sivas Railway Project. —I am informed that the Department of Public Works has already been approached by a French group, of which Count Vitalis is the head, with a view to the commencement of negotiations lor this concession. No formal application has so far been sent in, but it is understood that the French group have succeeded in obtaining the promise of Russian financial support in the enterprise, and that should the political difficulty in regard to the Black Sea basin be successfully over come by this arrangement, the group in question will commence active negotiations. The scheme wdll comprise the building of large harbour works at Samsoon.PMfl r 3 Danube-Adriatic Railway .—Surveys are to be made of the country in Turkish terri tory through which this line will pass. The administration of the Salonica-Constanti- nople junction railway have undertaken the work, but until the Turkish Government is 'yV.epared to grant some form of guarantee it is believed the line will not he built, The CSrveyors are now on the ground, hut can apparently do little owing to the difficulties they meet with at the hands of the local authorities. Demir-Hissar—Djuma-i- Bala Railway .—No progress has been made with project as the Government is unwilling to grant any guarantee. Panderma-Soma Railway .—It is understood that negotiations are still proceeding with the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway Company. Ports. M. Godard, one of the new technical advisers of the Department of Works, has been entrusted with a mission to examine and report on the ports of the Syrian coast. His first visit will he to 1 ripoli, and he will then visit Mersina, Alexandretta, Haiffa, and Jaffa, where he will in each case study and survey the ports with a view' to enable the department to determine at which of these ports could harbour works be profitably undertaken. In conclusion I may add that regret was expressed by the officials at the depart ment that British capitalists had so far shown little if any desire to enquire into and examine the various projects which the Ministry had in hand.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant respecting a concession for the construction of the Samsoun to Sivas Railway, and to state that the matter will receive consideration. With regard to the statement that you are still a’waiting the decision of the Secretary of State as to whether His Majesty’s Government will support you in applying for this concession, I am to point out that in a conversation between Mr. Mallet and Mr. Clifford Beckett, the representative of your syndicate, on the 27th ultimo, that gentleman was informed that this application could not be supported so long as the Russian preferential rights for railway construction in Northern Asia Minor existed, but that if co-operation could be arranged between your syndicate and the Russian and French groups, and if the Russian Government decided to support such a combination, then His Majesty’s Government might be disposed to give you official assistance m tms undertaking.

CONFIDENTIAL. [42411] No. 1 . The Euxine and Marmora British Development Syndicate to Sir Edward Grey. (Received November 19.) Finsbury Pavement House, London, Sir, November 18, 1909. I HAVE the honour, under instructions of the board of this syndicate, to lay the following facts before your Excellency for the favour of your kind consideration. Your Excellency has already been approached on behalf of my board, with a view to your authorising His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople to support the efforts which the representative of my syndicate is making in that city to secure the concession for the construction of the Samsun-Sivas Railway and its natural extensions, and we are still waiting your Excellency’s decision as to this request. I have the honour now to inform you that last week a deputation of five gentlemen, representing French and Russian interests, came, propria motu, to London from Paris, with the express purpose of forming a combination with my syndicate, in order to obtain concessions for public works in Turkey, and to do away with the useless competition of conflicting interests, which at present is militating largely against such concessions being granted to anyone. The principal of the French group is M. Perchot, a millionaire contractor (the constructor of the u Metropolitan ”), who has carried through affairs of the greatest magnitude in France, and who has proved to us that he is fully assured of the active support of the French Government, of the French Embassy at Constantinople, and of one of the most influential financial groups in Paris. The representative of the Russian group, who is closely associated with M. Perchot, is Rossolato Bey, who informs us that he had been personally assured by the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople of his intention to support any group which had the support of the French Embassy, and that he was aware from official information that, owing to circumstances arising out of the action of the Turkish Government in according the Bagdad Railway to Germany, the concession for the Samsun-Sivas Railway and all railways to the north would not be granted to anyone whomsoever, save with the entire concurrence, if not initiative, of the Russian Government, and on terms more favourable to the Turkish Government than those given in the Bagdad Railway concession. These gentlemen said that they were very anxious to be allied with an English group, so that the subjects of the three Powers should be found working in accord and not in opposition, and proposals were made and accepted by my directors, providing for the combined action of the three interests and for the formation of a syndicate representing the three interests, on terms which were considered entirely satisfactory to this syndicate, as fair and practicable. An agreement to this effect was accordingly entered into, and a representative agency, or “ bureau d’etudes,” will shortly be opened at Constantinople, with a resident representative from each of the three groups, as forming the local board, who will act under the instructions of the parent board sitting either in Paris or London. A discussion arose as to the name which should be given to this agency—whether it* should be merely called the international agency or the Anglo-Franco-Russian agency. The opinion of the Frenchmen and the Russians was wholly in favour of the latter proposal, and they said that they would have no difficulty in securing from their Governments the necessary consent to the adoption of this name, and they would at once write to their representative Foreign Offices with that object. Though my board is aware that your Excellency cannot give any direct authorisa tion in such a matter, I am directed to request that, should you see fit, you will kindly state whether there would be any objectioD to the adoption of this name as far as the English group is concerned. The board is unwilling to take any step which, even in so small a matter, might possibly run counter to the views of His Majesty’s Government. [2489 t—1] &gt;1I am also to beg that, in view of the fact that the arrangement now come to is calculated largely to minimise the conflict of interests which has hitherto existed between the subjects of the three named Powers, you will authorise His Majesty’s Ambassador in Constantinople to support the action of this combiued agency Constantinople in harmony with the guaranteed action of the hreneh and Russia Embassies.

It will be observed that Mr. Harmsworth does not say in his letter ot tlie 10th November that he intends to invest capital in the enterprise or to work it himseLE. In these circumstances, subject to the concurrence of the Board of Irade, fair L.

In the course of our last interview you very kindly enquired as to the extent of my association with oil enterprises. I may say that my business for several years past has comprised very little else. In the early part of 1906 I joined Sir George Newnes, Bart., M.P., Lord Joicey, the late Sir William Avery, and various other gentlemen in privately subscribincr 500,000/. to exploit the great oil fields of New South Wales, ray own contribution to this sum exceeding 100,000/. This venture was registered under the name of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation (Limited). It has for several years past been engaged in building a railway and erecting enormous distilling and refining plants at Wolgan and Torbaine in New South Wales. This enterprise forms the only native oil under taking in Australia, and in a few months’ time should begin to produce oil in quantities sufficient to supply the Austrnlian demand. I was also with some of these gentlemen responsible for the dispatch of a geological expedition to New Caledonia to examine the evidence of od in that French colony, without, however, satisfactory results ensuing. Acting upon the report of Mr. D. A. Sutherland, F.I.C., I commenced boring operations for oil early in 1908 in Egypt, at Jemsah on the Red Sea. At the present time two wells have been sunk to reach the oil-bearing strata, and have proved to be gushers, which at the present time are producing fully 500 tons of oil a-day. The financing of the Egyptian Oil Trust, the company formed to exploit this undoubtedly great oil field, was borne almost entirely by myself. Situated as' this field is upon the shores of the Red Sea, it is in an unique position to reach markets. In applying for the concession to work the reputed oil deposits in Mesoootamia, my intention is to pursue the same course as I have adopted in Egypt. On receipt of the concession, I should in the first place, despatch an expedition consisting of geologists and oil experts to report upon the conditions in the various spots where oil is reputed to exist. Should the report prove to be favourable, I should despatch a boring expedi tion to prove or disprove the anticipations of the experts. In this work I should have as my partner, and be associated with Mr. D. A. Sutherland, F.I.C., of 26, Victoria Street, S. W., under whose advice l have acted in all my various oil enterprises. I very much regret that Mr. D’Arcy did not respond favourably to the suggestion I made, at the instigation of the Foreign Office, that we should co-operate in the effort to secure this concession. I informed Mr. D’Arcy that I was quite willing to recognise that his past efforts to secure this concession and the considerable expense he had been put to thereby, should be taken into consideration by us, in the event of our joint effort resulting in the securing of the concession. In any case, however, should Mr. D’Arcy finally and definitely refuse co-operation, I propose to pursue this matter to the utmost of my ability and resources, in which f trust to have the support of the Foreign Office.

I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that it has been brought to their notice that Mr. W. K. D’Arcy, who is known to them as a director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the original concessionnaire of the oil-bearing territory now being worked by that company in Persia, is making application to the Turkish Government for the grant of a right to search for oil near Bagdad. My Lords are aware that associated with Mr. D’Arcy in his enterprise are Mr. C. W. Wallace and other directors of the Burmah Oil Company^ who are the only firm producing oil fuel at the present time in British possessions. The Burmah Oil Company have gone to much trouble and expense to produce an oil suitable for use in His Majesty’s ships, and have entered into a contract with the Admiralty for its supply over a term of years. . My Lords gather that if Mr. D’Arcy acquired the right to exploit the territory, he would be hacked by a British syndicate which has had wide experience in oil matters, and I am to request, therefore, that you will lay the above-mentioned facts before Sir Edward Grey as lending additional support to the representations which it is understood are already being addressed by the Foreign Office on behalf of Mr. D’Arcy s application for a concession.

Bylaugh Park, East Dereham, Dear Mr. Harmsworth, October 29, 1909. I HAYE now Jiad an opportunity of discussing the Turkish business with my friends and of showing them your letters, including the one last received. In the course of our discussion it soon became clear that the objects which you and we have in view are utterly divergent. You told me that your idea was, if you acquired the concession, to float a company in respect of a piece of territory at Mendate, and then another company in respect of another piece of territory and so on. Given successful flotation, it is obvious that there is money to be made in that way by the concessionnaire ; but the question of whether these different companies could work at a profit is a different one. It is a question which our experience leads us to answer in the negative, and no man can possibly say into whose hands their control and management will fall. We, on the other hand, are seeking the concession to work ourselves as oil producers, refiners, and sellers, and we have no intention of floating any company nor of parting with any portion of the concession. Nor do we intend to form any companies other than such as may be required (if any) by the Turkish authorities. For these reasons it was decided that it would not suit us to join hands with any group. Thanking you for giving me the offer of joining you, yours, &amp;c. W. K. D’ARCY.

(No. 346.) Foreign Office, November 9, 1909. MR. CLIFFORD BECKETT, the agent of the Euxine and Marmora Develop ment Syndicate, called at the Foreign Office on the 27th ultimo with reference to the scheme for constructing a railway from Samsoun to Sivas with prolongations, as mentioned in my despatch to Sir G. Lowther No7 326 of the 18th ultimo. He was informed that it would not be possible for His Majesty’s Government to support the company’s application for such a concession on account of the preferential rights held by the Russian Government under the Black Sea Basin Agreement of 1904, but that if his group were able to arrange to/co-operate with the Franco-Russian group, which, from Sir G. Lowther’s despatch No. 870, it seemed likely would undertake the work, then he might expect official support from His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Beckett seemed hopeful of being able to arrange such a combination. Apart from this, he enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would support an application for a concession to build a railway from Youmourtalik, on the Gulf of Alexandretta, inland, but not trenching on the area affected by the Russian preferential rights. He was informed that there was no objection to such a course of action, and you have been authorised by telegraph to support any application in this sense that may be made by Mr. Beckett’s group. Mr. Beckett also asked that we should suggest to the Porte that all applications in connection with this line should also be examined by the Financial Commission, as the transaction of business was most difficult with the Ministry of Public Works.

I HAVE the honour to ackowledge receipt of your despatch No. 326 of the 18th ultimo, enquiring whether any negotiations had taken place between the Russian and Turkish Governments in regard to the preferential rights of the former for railway construction in North Asia Minor, and whether the Porte had proposed any method for overcoming the difficulties placed in the way of railway construction by these rights. Your enquiry was to a great extent anticipated by His Majesty’s Ambassador in the report given in his despatch No. 870 of the 22nd ultimo, and I have been unable to learn that any fresh step has been taken by the Porte. In this connection I may, however, mention that the French Regie generale des Chemins de Per is believed to be contemplating applying for a railway concession in those districts, and that they hope to overcome any objections of the Russian Govern ment by engaging Russian capital in the enterprise. The Regie generale des Chemins de Per is the important company headed by Count Vitalis, and is in close connection with the Imperial Ottoman Bank. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M, MARLING.

Tcharykoff to-day on bis return from Livadia, and he told me that the only questions which had been treated there concerned the railways in Asia Minor and that of the 4 per cent. The desire of the Russian Government was in no way to follow a policy of obstruction with regard to Asia Minor, but to assist Turkey in her economic develop ment. If Russia held strictly to her rights she could claim that of building the Samsoun-Sivas railway line on the same conditions as those governing the Bagdad Railway, but the Russian proposal was that this line should be built by an international syndicate. In reply to my enquiries as to what he meant by an international syndicate, M. Tcharykoff said that it would be Franco-Russian, but that he did not personally see any objection to the admission of another foreign group into the syndicate. With regard to the 4 per cent, increase of customs, the Russian Government did not intend to attach to their assent any political conditions, but there was a con siderable importation of a superior class of flour from Russia into this country which would be seriously affected by the increase of the 4 per cent., and which could not compete with other flour under the higher tariff, and it was intended to bring here shortly from St. Petersbnrgh a commercial expert, and he hoped that some arrangement on this point might be arrived at. With regard to the proposed establishment of the petroleum monopoly, M. Isvolsky had told Rifaat Pasha that he was not prepared to- raise any objections, provided a similar clause to that contained in the Turco-Austrian protocol, namely, that a certain minimum quantity of petroleum should be taken from Russia based on an average consumption of two or three years, should be agreed on. M. Tcharykoff said that no mention whatever had been made of the Cretan question. I have, &amp;c. (For Sir Gerard Lowther), CHARLES M. MARLING.

His Highness replied that he could not answer definitely until he sau Kitac Pasha on his return. I was, however, aware, he said, that the Russians were asking foi T concession for the Danube-Adriatic line. If this were granted unconditionally the Austrian Government would inevitably return to the charge and demand a conces sion for the Mitrovitza Sanjak Railway. It had therefore suggested itself to him that, as there was no longer any desire to prevent Armenians from returning to Asia Minor, and that as thus one side of the bargain had fallen through, the Russians might e disposed to abandon their claim to the preferential rights for railway bmldmg m Northern Asia Minor basin in return for the sanction of the Adriatic scheme. If this were done the Turkish Government would be in a position to resist the Austrian demand for the Mitrovitza concession, for which no quid pro quo would be forthcoming as in the case of Russia. e I have, &amp;c.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 783 of the 25th ultimo, I have the honour to report that I have been able to gather the following further information from a Turkish official source concerning the Glasgow, Chester, and Schaeffer railway proposals in Asia Minor:— 1. Glasgow scheme: The trace' for this railway is, as already reported, from Sivas through Harput, Arghana, Diarbekir, Youmourtalik, Marash, Albistan, Malatia, Eghin, and Erzeroum, also from Diarbekir on to Mosul, and to a point on the Persian frontier to be determined. The railway is to be narrow gauge (l 1 5 metres), and no guarantees are asked, but the Government must give to the company the exclusive right to work all mines found within a radius of 20 kilom. The syndicate is to be exempted for fifteen years from the payment of royalties on all minerals exported from the mirtes, and royalties should only be demanded after that period if the gross traffic receipts of the railways built attain the sum of 12,000 fr. per kilometre. The concession is to be for a period of ninety-nine years. An option of sixteen months is demanded for making the necessary surveys, and should Mr. Glasgow’s syndicate decline to take up the concession after this period, all plans and drawings are to be handed over to the Government free of charge. 2. Chester’s proposals are exactly similar to Glasgow’s, except that the gauge is to be a normal one, i.e., 1'44 metres, and that he also proposes to build a line from Suedia to Aleppo touching Antioch, with a branch, if necessary, to Alexandretta, with extension on from Aleppo to Deir Zor. 3. Schaeffer’s schemes are also identical with Glasgow’s, except that should his syndicate decline to take up the concession at the expiry of the option, the Government is to have all drawings and plans on payment of half the cost of the surveys made. From the information which the Turkish Government have obtained from Washington and Brussels as to the stranding of the syndicates said to be supporting Glasgow, Chester, and Schaeffer, it appears that the supporters of Glasgow have a capital of about 7,000,000 dollars. Chester is backed by a person named Moore, as also by the Carnegie trust, who between them cannot, it is said, muster more than 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 dollars. The railway and mining schemes put forward by both these men will entail the expenditure of something like 16,000,000/. to 18,000,000/., and in view of the information obtained regarding the financial standing of Glasgow’s and Chester’s backers, the Government were not inclined to listen to either of the proposals put forward by them, so that they may be considered as “ dechus.” The news regarding the financial standing of Schaeffer was quite favourable, and it has been ascertained that his syndicate can carry out all the schemes put forward by him. My informant, however, doubted whether the Government would entertain Schaeffer’s scheme as it stood at present, as he considered that there were other parts of the country which needed railway communication far more than those mentioned in Schaeffer’s project. It seems probable, however, that he will get some of his proposals through. The local press announces that the Tripoli branch line has been given to Vitalis. This announcement is premature ; but I gather that there is every probability of the negotiations terminating soon. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received October 4.) (No. 791. Confidential.) Sir, Therapia, September 29, 1909. I HAVE the honour to submit the following information, obtained from an official in the Ministry of Public Works, concerning railway concessions, a loan for the con struction of roads, and the interference of the Grand Vizier in the work of the various departments of State. Count Vitalis’ scheme for the Homs-Tripoli (Syria) railway will be put through, and matters are already fairly far advanced. He is also to have the concession for the Demir-Hissar-Djouma-Bala line, which the Turks are anxious to have built. * The Government are not, however, pressing for the building of the Drama- Cavalla line—another of Vitalis’ schemes—as it is not felt to be a matter of immediate necessity. Count Vitalis is also interested in the Samsoun-Sivas line, aud, in order to over come any difficulty which may be raised by Russia, he has interested Russian capital in the scheme. The official from whom this information was obtained saw no reason why this scheme should not succeed. The department had not even examined Colonel Schaeffer’s project for the Alexandretta-Suleymanieh line, as the greater part of the country through which the line is to run comes within the Baghdad Railway zone, and, until the Germans put down their final “trace,” the department think it useless to study the scheme, which, in the opinion of the above-mentioned official, has no chance of success. Colonel Schaeffer has also put forward a scheme similar to those of Messrs. Glasgow' \ and Chester. Both the latter are at present in suspense. The German application for a concession for the Rayak-al-Arish line (Egyptian frontier) has fallen through. The department is negotiating, in conjunction w T ith the Treasury, a loan of ten millions for the construction of roads ; the preliminary work on this subject has just been commenced. Much dissatisfaction is felt in the department at the interference of the Grand Vizier. His Highness is said to be endeavouring to control all the departments on the lines of the old regime, and this is causing friction. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

You will perceive that after confirming the rejection of the Bill by which it was proposed to grant the concession out and out to Mr. Glasgow, it proceeds to recapitulate the main lines of the contract, and then authorises the executive to negotiate with whatever company might offer the best terms, the grant of a concession on those lines. Extract from “ Takvim-i-vekai ” of the 1st (14^) September, 1909. Decree of the Senate concerning Railway Construction in Anatolia. THE following is a copy of the Decree drawn up by the Senate in accordance with a discussion which took place in the Chamber of Deputies, and, on a request for its being put into execution, sanctioned by Imperial Irade, concerning a concession for the construction and working of railways in certain places in Anatolia without guarantees from present and fixed revenue, but on condition of profiting by the discovered and undiscovered mines. There has been transmitted to the Bill Committee of the Chamber of Deputies a Bill consisting of a single article, drawn up by the Ministry of Public Works and studied and modified by the Council of Ministers, containing a request for permission to conclude a contract with Dr. Bruce Glasgow, who is applying, in the name of an American company, for a concession for the construction and working of railways in certain places in Anatolia without guarantees from present and fixed revenues, but on condition of profiting by the discovered and undiscovered mines. The Bill sent by the Government is for permission to conclude a contract with a certain person indicated. Now, as it is possible that other competitors may be found for the building of these railways on the same conditions as those set forth in the said Bill, or on still more favourable terms, and as applications of this nature have already been made to the Chamber of Deputies, the said Committee approved, and that Committee’s detailed examination was accepted by the general assembly of the Chamber of Deputies, that instead of the aforesaid Bill permission should be given to the executive to conclude a contract with the company offering the terms which are best and most favourable to the interests of the country for a concession to build and work lines (1) fiom 8ivas, passing Kharput, Ergheni, Diarbekir, and Bitlis, and the northern or southern shore of Lake Van ; (2) starting from a point to be fixed on the Van-Sivas-Diarbekir line and running ’to Yumurtalik via the Jihan Valley ; (3) starting from a point on the Diarbekir-Van line and stretching to Mosul, Kerkuk, and Suleimanieh, on the following terms:— 1. No guarantee shall be given by the Ottoman Government for assuring the capital or the interest for either the building or the working of the lines, but in return a 99 years’ concession shall be given for the mines, now being worked in the name of the Government, or which shall be discovered by the company, in the land within a distance of 20 kilom. on both sides of the line to be constructed. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Inclosure in No. 1. [2460 d —G]2.

The contract to be concluded between the Government and the company seekin^ the concession shall be submitted to the confirmation of the general Assembly (Chamber of Deputies).

The aforesaid documents should, first, according to the requirements of the Constitution, and of the internal regulation, have been handed over to a committee ; but the Cabinet having pleaded urgency, and the time being unfavourable, the plea was accepted, and the said teskereh and its enclosures having been read and examined in the general Assembly of the Senate, and accepted with modifications by the Chamber of Deputies, it was confirmed by a majority that permission should be given to the executive, and it was resolved that, after applying for the Royal sanction, the Decree should be published in the official newspaper and handed over to the executive to be applied and carried out.[32316] Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 277 of the 7th instant inquiring as to the concession applied for by Mr. Glasgow, 1 have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of the preliminary contract made between him and the Turkish Minister of Public Works. You wall perceive that Mr. Glasgow proves not to be a representative of the Standard Oil Company, but of the J. G. White Construction Company, described as of New' York and London. This has given colour to the report which appears to have been spread mainly by Mr. Glasgow himself that he represented a large amount of British capital. The American charge d’affaires, who has supported him very warmly, stated that no doubt, as so large a sum of money would be necessary for the enterprise, a considerable portion of it—several millions—would beraised in England, and then in fact he would be representing large British interests. It is next to be noticed that the proposed railway is apparently to start at Sivas, and go thence to Diarbekir, Van, Mossul, and Kerkouk, and finally to Youmourtalik, which is on the Gulf of Fayas, near Mersina. It will not, therefore, encroach upon the reserved Prussian sphere of the Black Sea basin, but it does not explain how it is proposed to get to Sivas in order to commence from that town. But the intention is expressed of endeavouring to invade the German preserve on the sea between Tripoli and Mersina. Articles 2 and 3 give the concessionnaires a period of sixteen months within which to make surveys of the line and to decide whether or not they will take up the concession, and article 5 holds the Turkish Government from granting any concession or right to search for petroleum in the vilayets of Van, Bitlis, and Mossul—a prohibition which appears definitely to postpone Mr. D’Arcy’s negotiations for the Mesopotamian oil-fields until the end of the sixteen months allowed. There are other proposals now being put forward, in addition to that which is being put forward by Mr. Beckett, to whom I referred in my despatch No. 674 of the 17th August, for the construction of railways in Anatolia, notably one w T hich is being pressed by a Mr. Chester, who represents an American syndicate ; and another by Colonel Schaeffer, on behalf of some Belgian capitalists. 1 shall have the honour to report on these schemes as soon as I can obtain reliable information concerning them.

As to the steps that 1 am taking to secure the concession, you will have learned from Mr. Greenway, who called at the Foreign Office a fewfdays ago, together with Mr. Nichols, who has been representing me in Constantinople, that I am still doing all in my power to secure the concession, and that, in view of the new competitors who have come into the field, Mr. Nichols has come to London to discuss the pos-ition and to take fresh instructions. A meeting will be held next Tuesday to decide upon the best means of meeting this competition, and Mr. Nichols will immediately thereafter return to Constantinople to carry out the steps decided upon, and to use his utmost endeavours to bring matters to an issue at the earliest possible moment. In the meantime, I have no doubt I may rely upon the continued support of the Foreign Office, and if you can, through the instrumentality of Sir G.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 686 of the 23rd on the subject of Mr. Glasgow’s railway scheme, I have the honour to state that I am now informed that that gentleman does not represent the Standard Oil Company, but is acting on behalf of I. and S. White and Co., a constructive company in the United States. I asked the Grand Vizier yesterday how matters stood, and he explained that Mr. Glasgow’s scheme had been made public, and the Turkish Government were ready to receive offers on the general lines laid down. This procedure does not seem to have pleased Mr. Glasgow, who left Constantinople, but it is not known whether he has done so definitely. I asked whether his scheme was considered to encroach on the Bagdad Railway system. His Highness was of opinion that it might, but that would form the subject of a settlement direct between the two parties interested. The pro posed outlet into the Mediterranean would be Yimurtalik, in the Gulf of Alexandretta. His Highness added that several were seeking concessions on similar lines—another American company, a Belgian company, and a company represented by an Armenian but his Highness seemed somewhat doubtful as to the financial standing of the different bidders. If all the railway schemes came to nothing, the Government would be prepared to receive negotiations with the representative of Mr. D’Arcy for the oil field. In the meantime the latter had taken to England the Glasgow scheme in order to consult his principals. His Highness implied that as long as such generally favourable offers of a very comprehensive nature were being made, it was impossible for the Government to deal with Mr. D’Arcy’s agent in a comparatively small concern, as, under the new conditions in Turkey, Government is bound to be guided by the wishes of its Parliament, which is naturally determined to insist on acceptance of the scheme which appears to be most advantageous to the interests of the country in general. I took the opportunity of telling his Highness that there was an impression that the Government was endeavouring generally in the matter of concessions and orders to drive too hard a bargain, and that the effect would be to discourage and drive away bond fide competitors. His Highness declared that this was not so. The Government, his Highness said, had such innumerable offers in all directions that some severity must be shown in order to eliminate such as were not really serious competitors. I have, &amp;c.

IN my despatch No. 674 of the 17th instant I had the honour to bring to your notice a scheme for railway construction, without kilometric guarantees, but with the right to exploit mines within 20 kilom. of either side of the line, which was being put forward by a Mr. Glasgow, acting on behalf of the Standard Oil Trust. The project was discussed at the sitting of Parliament on Friday last. The commission which had been appointed to report upon it reported favourably, but drew attention to another scheme on similar lines but more favourable to Government—a percentage of profits and a tax on minerals exported to be paid to the Government, &amp;c. After a little preliminary discussion the Minister of Public Works addressed the House, saying that similar concessions were granted in America, that the construction of railways was of urgent necessity, that the Government was not in a position to afford further kilometric guarantees, and that the sum necessary for building the line (which is to reach from Samsoun via Sivas and Kharput to Van) would be about £ T. 20,000,000, the expenditure of which in the country would be of the greatest advantage.’ It would, he said, be desirable that the gauge should be greater—1’45 metres, as in the other Anatolian lines—but the cost would then amount to between £ T. 30,000,000 and £ T. 40,000,000. He begged the House to authorise him to negotiate with foreign capitalists on the lines proposed by Mr. Glasgow, and to decide as to the necessary measure of the gauge. On resuming his seat he was subject to a violent attack by Jahid Bey, and a considerable digression, ending in the suspension of the sitting, followed. On resuming the discussion later the report of the committee was adopted by a large majority, the result being that the Minister of Public Works is authorised to enter into negotiations with capitalists on the basis proposed. The Grand Vizier told me to-day that if this scheme was realised the trace would be laid down by Turkish military engineers, but if it did not suit Mr. Glasgow’s syndicate to accept that trace they would be at liberty to withdraw. His Highness also told me he had caused a copy of the scheme to be given to Mr. Nichol, representing Mr. D’Arcy, in the event of his wishing to present a counter-proposal more favourable to the Ottoman Government. His Highness also said that another American syndicate had proposed to build 5,000 kilom. in Asia Minor. He was enquiring as to the stability of this syndicate. The House next proceeded to consider a Bill for a railway from Hodeida to Sanaa in the Yemen, and after a discussion upon the merits of offering at auction great enterprises such as this railway, in which Gabriel Effendi Noradounghian gave way and accepted the auction system, the Bill was passed, subject to the consent of the Senate. The Bill, the text of which, as published in the press, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, provides for the construction of a line from Hodeida to Sanaa and on to Amran, of a branch line from Hodeida to Jebana Bay, and of a port Jebana, the said enterprise to be carried out on the lines laid down in the preliminary convention drawn up between the Minister of Public Works and David Elie Leon Bey, of Paris.

I have told them that we had been supporting you, and that, until the other day, we had hoped that your concession would go through. They said that they heard that an American syndicate had come into the field, which tallies with Sir G. Lowther’s information, and that your immediate chances had diminished. I inquired whether they had put themselves in touch with you, but they had not done so, and they asked me whether I would mention the matter to you. Hence my letter. Possibly, if you felt inclined, you would communicate with them. I made it a condition that, if we supported any application of theirs, we should have to insist on assurances that the company formed to work the concession would be preponderatingly British, with a majority of British directors on the board, and would remain so. I may mention that, on hearing from Sir G. Lowther that an American syndicate was in the running, we telegraphed, strongly urging that the concession should be given to a British applicant.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 23.) (No. 674.) Sir, . Therapia, August 17, 1909. IN your despatch No. 471 of the 10th November last, you instructed me to give the representative of Messrs. D’Arcy’s syndicate all the assistance in my power in their negotiations to obtain a concession for oil springs in Mesopotamia. The negotiations have since then been actively pursued despite sundry unfortunate interruptions due to the political crises which have from time to time occurred, and on the 20th June I was able to inform you (in my telegram No. 212) that the Council of Ministers had, according to a statement made to me by the Grand Vizier, practically decided to grant the concession. But this decision proved not to be final. I informed you on the 13th ultimo that the matter was being reconsidered on the point of reserving certain springs, but on the 1st August, as you will have gathered from my telegram No. 251, matters appeared to be proceeding favourably. Suddenly a quite new series of obstacles has, however, presented itself. The Ministry with which the D’Arcy group has been dealing suddenly informed him, no doubt owing to parliamentary pressure, when their proposals were all but agreed to, that it would be necessary first to publish the offer, giving a delay of three months, in order that it might be ascertained whether there were not others who would tender for the concession on terms more favourable to the Turkish Govern ment. Mr. Nicholl naturally returned an absolute refusal to this proposal, but was obliged to provoke a telegraphic confirmation from the syndicate that they would definitely abandon the scheme rather than have their offer thus, so to say, put up to auction, before he could induce the Turks to believe that he was serious. They next proposed not to publish the D’Arcy offer, but merely to put up the concession to the highest bidder. I gather they have been prompted to do this partly by a not very serious offer made to them by an apparently not very serious Roumanian firm, but more especially by the fear of the responsibility for granting any concession whatever, lest it should be commented on unfavourably and to their disadvantage in the Parliament. Mr. Nicholl is greatly concerned at the turn things have taken, which shows, he says, a breach of faith on the part of the Grand Vizier, who had made him promises on the subject, but I am inclined to think that Mr. Nicholl was over sanguine, and regarded as a promise what was more in the nature of an engagement. I think he is more seriously alarmed about a new scheme which has recently been launched upon the sea of concessions. I refer to a proposal which has been made by Mr. Glasgow on behalf of the American Oil Trust to build railways in Anatolia without any guarantee at all, but with the right to exploit mines lying within 20 kilom. on either side of the line, and I have the honour to enclose * a document which has been drawn up by a warm partisan of the scheme setting forth the advantages which may be expected to accrue to the Ottoman Empire from it. It is an ingenious and specious paper, though vitiated by sundry manifest fallacies upon which it is unnecessary for me to dilate, but it is characteristic of Mr. Glasgow’s methods, who has adorned his projects with much skill. He has informed the Grand Vizier—and his statement has received the confirmation of the United States charge d’affaires—that he has 20,000,000Z. ready to invest for the scheme provided it is accepted, otherwise he will employ his 20,000,000^. in one of the many other properties in the world which are crying for development, and which very likely will prove more profitable than this. But Mr. Glasgow discloses that he cannot start construction quite at once, but will need some sixteen months to study the trace of the line, which, however, he would be prepared to alter to suit the military necessities of the country. From the Turkish point of view the prospect of giving a line to an American is rendered doubly seductive by the thought that he at least can have no arriere-pense'e as to territorial aggrandisement or political interest. [2378 z—7] * Not printed.I am not disposed, however, to think that the D’Arcy group have any grave reason to fear the competition of the Standard Oil Company’s railway. I am assured by their agent that their Persian oil-field can always beat out of the field any competition from the Turkish side on account of its greater remoteness from the sea, and it will ir^ any^case require a long time before this line can reach down to the vicinity of Most/ or Kerkuk. Mr. Glasgow’s plans are more likely to prove a stumbling block in tb way of certain negotiations which I understand are being carried on by an English group under the auspices of a Mr. Beckett for the acquisition of a concession of a railway from Samsoun, in the direction of Sivas. This is a matter to which I have already referred in my despatch No. 553 of the 10th ultimo. I have, &amp;c.

The subject was aiis xiigimess repneu uiat an ^American syndicate naa asKea lor a concession in that direction, which would include some oil-fields, but his Highness did not think the Government would grant any. The conditions agreed to by Russia in return for these preferential rights had been that she would prevent the Armenians from returning to Asia Minor, but as since the constitution the Armenians had a right to go where they wished, the agreement with Russia might be considered as ipso facto concluded. Nevertheless, the Ottoman Government did not think the moment opportune for negotiating with Russia on the subject. As a matter of fact, I believe the Porte has approached the Russian Government with a view to a dissolution of the agreement, but met with an unfavourable reply. I have, &amp;c.

A New Railway to the Persian Gulf.— On Wednes day several newspapers announced that a syndicate of British capitalists had in view a railway scheme which was assured of the cordial support of the Turkish Government. Although no comment was made on the fact, the proposal is one which if carried into effect will prove a formidable rival to the Bagdad Railway, which is so dear to German politicians. The new line is to run from Tripoli in Syria to Homs, a station on the Mecca Railway, and thence along the edge of the Syrian desert to the right bank of Euphrates, which it will descend to Bassorah and Koweit. From Kerbela to the sea the English scheme so closely resembles the German that surely one or the other will eventually be dropped as they could scarcely exist side by side. Inasmuch as influential Englishmen have continually pestered the Government to stipulate for British control at the sea end of the Bagdad railway, it is to be hoped that the English scheme will prevail. The new line will not be a shorter route than the Bagdad project. It will not rival that route in attractions for passengers who are shy of the sea, but it will provide a rapid link between the Mediterranean, and the Persian Gjlf, and is rich in commercial possibilities.Minute Paper. 1 Register No. 3o 7?

CONFIDENTIAL. [February 5.] Section 1. [4783] No. 1. (No. 61. Sir, I HAVE the honour to reply to your despatch No. 10 of the 12th instant, requesting my observations upon a scheme which is being put forward by certain British subjects in connection with a Syrian group for the construction of a railway from Tripoli to Homs, and for the amelioration of the harbour at the former town. ^ • I have but little to add to the remarks contained in my predecessor’s Commercial despatch No.HdS of the 25th November, 11107, to which I have the honour to invite A % your attention. ^ It is obvious that the last paragraph no longer holds good, as people are now presenting themselves for the development of the project. I presume that the present group hope to evade the application of the stipulation in Article 12 of the Bagdad Railway Concession by the fact that the new line will not touch that railway, and so cannot be considered as forming a branch of it. In the present embryonic and confidential state of the negotiations between the private parties concerned, I am reluctant, for fear of damaging their interests, to inquire how strong an opposition, whether political or financial, they are likely to encounter on the part of their French and German rivals, but I can hardly doubt but that it will be severe. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beirout, to whom I forwarded your despatch for his observations, had none to offer beyond expressing the opinion that the line ought to prove a financial success. But he forwarded to me some letters from Mr. Skinner, who is the chief promoter of the new scheme, copies of which I have the honour to forward herewith. From these it appears that the Company is to be a British Company, which should materially tend to secure the favourable attention of the Turkish Government to the application for a Concession, though it will not lessen French and German opposition. Next you will observe that the scheme is far more ambitious than it appeared from the papers submitted to you. The idea really is to carry it on from Homs to Deir on the Euphrates and thence down the river to Bussorah, which will involve a sum of about 8,000,000/. In granting their assistance and protection to the Tripoli-Homs scheme, His Majesty’s Government are, of course, not committing themselves to the greater project, but the present scheme has to be viewed with a different eye when its proposed ultimate development is considered. For instance, this line must meet the Bagdad line at Deir, and it is then a question if thereby an “ embranchement a la mer ” is not constituted. Mr. Cumberbatch, in noticing that the Agreement between the Syrian Company and that under the auspices of Sir Charles Campbell transfers all the rights of pre-emption of the former to the latter, while it engages the former to provide a portion of the capital needed for making the railway, adds that he presumes that Sir Charles Campbell has taken guarantees for the carrying out of their engagements by the Tripoli group to prevent difficulties being raised later on. It is nofeasy to Uvse too much caution in dealing with Syrians. NO doubt you will have been informed by our Syrian friends that Mr. Ezzedine would not accept Messrs. Carlton, Creig and Company’s proposals for carrying out I have, &amp;c. (Signed) GERARD LOWTHER. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Mr. Skinner to Vice-Consul Abela.

[2152 e—1] Bthe Tripoli-Homs Railway, and as it was impossible to get any other firm to undertake the business on Mr. Ezzedine’s terms, T had to give up the scheme as intended by our Syrian friends. . In the meantime, the constitutional changes in Turkey and the increased interest that England and France are taking in Turkish and especially Syrian affairs made me decide to lav the matter before our Foreign Office, but in an extended form, as I knew that our Foreign Office would take but little interest in such a small railway, as we intended it to be, from Tripoli to Homs. In view of the great efforts the German Government is making to obtain control of the greater part of Mesopotamia ^ and Syria through its Bagdad Railway, I suggested an English conapetition by building a connecting line between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, for which no better starting point than Tripoli could be found, on account of its splendid harbour and its close proximity to Cyprus and the Egyptian ports and the Suez Canal. I am pleased to say that I met with success, and matters are progressing so far so satisfactorily that Sir Charles Campbell, Vice-Admiral and K.C.G., is appointed, and has undertaken this post to be British Agent in London for carrying out this gigantic scheme. Jointly with us the French Government has taken the greatest interest in the undertaking, which has been personally approved of by the French Ministers, Clemenceau and Pichon, who have also nominated two Agents, namely, M. Fabre-Luce of the Credit Lyonnais (Vice-President) and M. Jacques Siegfried, of the Banque de 1’Afrique de Sud, to co-operate with Sir Charles Campbell for carrying out the scheme. The leading banks for the finance of the business are— For England .—Baron d’Erlanger. For France .—The Credit Lyonnais. One half of the capital is to be subscribed by the English Bank, the other half by the Credit Lyonnais. In view of *this joint working of the biggest banks in England and France and the assistance of the French Government and our Joreign Office, there is every possibility now that this railway will start from Tripoli and be carried via Homs to Heir on the Euphrates, and from there along the Euphrates to Bussorah, or so far as the River Euphrates is navigable for bigger ships to the Persian Gulf. The capital required for this undertaking is naturally a very large one, as the length of line is nearlv 1,000 miles and will absorb circa 8,000,000/. f have laid all the former negotiations with our Syrian friends before the Foreign Office, and gave all the original letters I held. Of course, I had to mention the gieat amount of trouble and the untiring interest you yourself have taken in getting this business so far, and I reported to Sir Charles that it was onlj through j oui influence we managed to keep the business so long in our hands and preventing others from getting hold of it, and 1 have no doubt that your services in this matter will be remembered in some form or another. Now, Sir Charles has written to me about our Syrian friends and their co-operation with the Anglo-French Company carrying out this undertaking, and he states that for political reasons it is most important that this Company must be an Anglo-French- Syrian one, and that it is absolutely necessary that our Syrian friends are incorporated in this business, not so much on account of the capital they will invest in this undei- taking as to clear away some obstacles which some of the continental Powers (Germany) are sure to raise when the Concession will be applied for. lo an Anglo- French Company they may object, but to an Anglo-French-Syrian Company they cannot, as they have no grounds to base their objections upon, for nobody can hinder the Syrians from developing their own country, and by means of railways and harbours this can best be effected. For this reason I have suggested to Sir Charles that our Syrian friends enter into the Anglo French Company on the former conditions, namely, that they carry out the orhdnaf programme for a line from Tripoli to Homs, and the Anglo-French Company wifi find half the capital required for this “section”—to start with—of the Tripoli- Persian Gulf Railway, and if our Syrian friends then like to invest further capital for the prolongation from Homs to Heir and the Persian Gull, of course they are quite welcome to subscribe such amounts as they wish to invest. Will you therefore be so kind as to explain this business to Mr. Ezzedinc, and point out to him that on this side the greatest importance is attached to the co-operation of the Syrians with the Anglo- French Company, and what an immense profit Tripoli and its trade will derive from beino- made the centre of the Mediterranean once the line is carried as far as Bussorah,in which doubtless Mr. Ezzedine and his friends will take a very grdat share. Will you please, then, get Mr. Ezzedine to state what amount of capital is likely to be subscribed by him and his friends— (a.) For the line Tripoli-Homs. (6.) For the line Homs-Deir-Bussorah. This statement I should suggest to be made in a form that can be laid directly before Sir Charles. Kindly get also Mr. Ezzedine and his friends to state their willingness to enter ento a co-operation with the Anglo-French Company, and that he is agreeable to Sir Charles Campbell acting as agent also on their behalf in England. When all this is settled somebody will probably come out to Constantinople and Tripoli to arrange all the details of the undertaking with Mr. Ezzedine and his friends. Do not forget to mention to Mr. Ezzedine and his friends, and for information to bis friend Mr. Moussali at Beirout, that as regards the commissions to be paid to him and Mr. Moussali as was arranged in London that that arrangement holds, of course, good, and should more capital be subscribed beyond Homs the remuneration will also be larger. I leave it to your discretion to inform Messrs. Yanni about this letter; of course, if the business goes through they will get also the commission as arranged previously. In conclusion, 1 must point out that in case, against all expectations, Mr. Ezzedine should not consent to co-operate with the Anglo-French Company for carrying out the railway, it is to be feared that the Concession will be taken up all the same by the Anglo-French Company, and, though under difficulties, carried out; hut Mr. Ezzedine and his friends and Mr. Yanni would not profit in any way by such a proceeding, as the Anglo-French Company would assuredly refuse to pay any commissions if they obtained the Concession without the co-operation of our Syrian friends. I hope this will not be the case, and you will get Mr. Ezzedine and Company to join in this enterprise, out of which a lot of money will find its way into the pockets of our Syrian friends if they work with us. Please get Mr. Ezzedine to send the two statements I asked for as soon as possible, so that Sir Charles may know what further steps to take, as the business is being urged on as fastf as possible. I have no doubt you will be very pleased to hear these interesting and good news, but I must beg that you will keep them as secret as possible, and enjoin Mr. Ezzedine and Mr. Yanni to do likewise till positive facts admit of publishing this very important undertaking, which no doubt will have a very startling effect in some countries.

Auf Eichberg, Luuterbach (Hessen), Germany, Dear Sirs, November 30, 1908. I AM much obliged to you for your kind letter of the 17th instant a few days ago; I had also one from Dr. Harris. At last we have now the business in the right quarter, and from all appearance it seems as if it would be a great success, at any rate, we have the very best people in it with the best intentions to do it interested in it. I am sending you a short Agree ment drawn up by Sir Charles Campbell and Baron d’Erlanger aiid Co. to serve for the present as a preliminary basis for a definite Agreement to be entered into and concluded and ratified on the spot in Syria. I send you also a letter which, at the request of the London Foreign Office, Sir Charles has laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in order that steps can be taken at once by our British Embassy at Constantinople to protect our interests and prevent anybody else from stepping in and hiking up the Concession. I must remark that, for the pYesent, as I have already written to Dr. Harris, we must only apply for a Concession as far as Homs, afterwards going on with the railway as soon as it is started at I ripoli. Now, what I wish Mr. Ezzedine and yourself to do is this :— 1. To let us know if you consent to this Agreement, leaving it to you to add any clauses you may wish to, though for the present I think it contains everything necessary for a preliminary Agreement till the final one is drawn up out there. 2. To send, if it has not been done already, a document empowering Sir Charles to act on behalf of the Syrian group in this business in London with as little delay as possible. To inform your friends at Constantinople that an application will be made for a Concession to construct and work a railway from Tripoli to Homs, and also for the improvement of the harbour at Tripoli in connection with this railway, requesting your friends to assist in every way, that such a Concession is given with every possible speed, this being of the utmost importance and for the mutual benefit of all those concerned in the undertaking. As regards the Agreement drawn up by Sir Charles and Company, I point out that the commission lor you and Mr. Ezzedine has been left out on purpose, as al Agreement is drawn up out there on the spot between your group and the London one, you will be able to make better terms and obtain a higher sum, and I will support you for all your troubles, than we agreed upon in London. It was for this reason it was omitted to mention any special sum in this preliminary Agreement assuring you which shall in no case be less than agreed upon, and lor which ample means have been set aside. I have written to Dr. Harris a few days ago explaining what I wanted him to ask Mr. Ezzedine to do, and I am now awaiting to hear from him, and, of course, now also from you. I requested him especially to beg you, Messrs. Ezzedine and his group to consent to my using the title of “ Chief Consulting and Constructing Engineer ” on behalf of the Syrian group, and act in that character. I shall consider it a great favour if a letter to this purpose was sent me by Mr. Ezzedine and his group.

I HAVE the honour to bring to your notice the details of an undertaking which has for its object the improvement of the harbour of Tripoli, and the construction of an Anglo-Syrian Railway from Tripoli to Homs, a distance of some 50 miles. 2. The present owners of the Tripoli-Homs road for waggons, carriages, &amp;c., are Messrs. Ezzedine, who would sell the road to the Tripoli-Homs Railway Company when formed. 3. Bankers, Financers, &amp;c. I have approached Messrs. d’Erlanger and Company, British Bankers and Financiers, of 20, Bishopsgate Street (Within), and they have consented to investigate the scheme in detail, and to send out an engineer and accountant to make a survey and estimate with a view of forming a Company if the report is satisfactory. 4. This Company would be a British Company under British management, and its head-quarters will be in London. The estimated capital required is from 350.000/. to 400,000/. 5. The chief Contractors would be English (Messrs. Pauling and Company). 6. Local labour would be employed to the fullest extent possible, and Messrs. Ezzedine and Company, who besides owning the present road have property along the line, would be the local Contractors. 7. Some French capitalists have expressed a desire to co-operate, and if satisfactory arrangements can be made their assistance might be accepted, but on no account will any German assistance be sought or interference permitted. 8. I he present Constitution is solely and purely Anglo-Syrian, and I am most anxious with as little delay as possible to obtain a Concession from the Turkish Government for the laying of the rails on the present road, and making the necessary alterations in curves, gradients, &amp;c.9. Under the above conditions, I have the honour to request, on behalf of the Anglo-Syrian group, whom I represent in England, that the British Government will grant the undertaking the privilege of its snpport, and such assistance as is consistent with the existing regulations and customs in obtaining a Concession for the Tripoli- Homs Railway and Tripoli Harbour Improvement.

I have now the honour to inclose the text of the Agreement, which has come into my hands, and from which you will observe that the construction of any lines in this district is reserved exclusively to Russians, among foreigners, under the same conditions as those governing the construction of the Bagdad Railway. The Agree ment does not extend to the Ada-Bazaar-IIeraclee line, nor to the lines from Angora- C^sarea-Kharput-Bitlis and Van. The matter is of interest at this moment, as a question is shortly to be asked in the Chamber about this Agreement, but the Grand Vizier informs me that an evasive answer will be given. His Highness added, however, that when the Turkish Government have got over their other troubles they will suggest to the Russian Govern ment that, as all the Armenians have returned to the Turkish side of the frontier, the prevention of their return having been at the time of the Agreement greatly desired by the Sultan in his fear of revolutionaries, and one of the main considerations for which the Agreement was made on the part of the Ottoman Government, this side of the Agreement has ipso facto lapsed. Yet, as the document makes no mention of the Armenians, it is hard to see on what his Highness will be able to base his negotiations in this direction, and the \ First Dragoman of the Russian Embassy recently remarked that it could indeed be &lt; cancelled, but only at a good price.

Its harbour is beyond the Lebanon and anti-Lebanon, and forms the outlet of a broad plain w r hich lies betweenThe Lebanon and anti-Lebanon known to be most fertile. [2005 ee—1] B2 Population.' Tripoli has a population of nearly 50,000 inhabitants of various nationalities and religions, but principally Arabs, though the foremost trades and industries are in the hands of foreigners, mostly Greeks. Industries and Produce of the Tripoli District. The principal industries of Tripoli are the manufacture of soap, oils, silk, cotton, furniture, earthen and metal wares. Great quantities of fruit, such as oranges (equal to the famous Jaffa oranges), lemons, figs, grapes, and vegetables of all kinds are grown and exported; enormous crops of cereals, wheat and barley, are obtained year after year from the rich soil, which requires very little tilling, and assisted by the regularity of rainfall caused by the proximity of the Lebanon and anti-Lebanon. Great quantities of sheep and goats are reared for their wool as well as for their flesh and milk, and the export of wool is considerable. Climate. The climate is an exceedingly good one, though during several months of the year the heat is at times great. There is always a fresh breeze in the afternoon, and the nights are invariably cool. Trade. Tripoli is the centre of the trade with the interior. From here everything that comes by sea is sent into the interior; from here all that comes by land is taken to the ships for transmission to different parts of the world. A good deal goes to Egypt. Means of Traffic. Up r to now all traffic has to be done by camels, mules, horses, and by waggons drawn by mules and horses. 'Phis traffic is enormous, so that at times for want of animals and waggons, or in winter time when there is much rainfall, there is often a regular breakdown and great delay in transmitting goods from Tripoli into the interior and vice versa. Road Company. The traffic is maintained by means of a well-constructed macadamized road, built by a native limited Company about forty years ago, which holds an Imperial Ottoman Concession, and has the exclusive rights of traffic on this road. This Road Company has 300 camels, horses, and mules of its own, over 120 four- wheeled waggons able to carry about 1 ton, and a number of mail coaches for carrying the mail and passengers, as well as a kind of express parcel-post, and yet with all this the Company is not able to carry the whole traffic over its road and levy a.small tax upon such mode of carrying goods and passengers.

For this reason the directors of the Road Company have decided to turn the road into a railway, first of all with a view to economize in the working expenses for keeping up the traffic and to reduce the expenses for maintenance of the road, which have been ascertained to be much heavier for their road than for a railway ; secondly, with a view to increasing the Company’s capabilities of effectually managing all the traffic which has to pass over the road and for which it was constructed, as, in consequence of their present inability to do so, much of the traffic is passed over the Balbeck-Beirout Railway and the Lebanon road which ought to pass over this road. Description of present Road. The load constructed and used for traffic by the present Company starts from Tripoli and goes as far as the town of Homs, about 50 miles distant from Tripoli.Homs is a good-sized town of 80,000 inhabitants, and the centre of a most fertile country, with good trade and industries; it is also a station of the Balbeck-Kherack Kailway, a branch line ot the Beirout—Damascus Railway. Railway from Beirout to Damascus. , reaso f} ^ ie traffic from Homs to the sea, i.e., to Beirout, does not go over the existing railway are various: first, the greater distance to Beirout than to Tripoli • secondly, as the Lebanon has to be traversed, very heavy gradients are being used on that railway necessitating the adoption of the Abt system (rack raiL, so that only a very limned number of cars can be drawn on the line at a time, which in consequence involves not only great delay, but also heavy freight rates ; furthermore, as the harbour at Beirout does not allow vessels at any time to load or unload, there are always heavy charges for storage of goods. J J Advantages of the future Tripoli—Homs Railway. xi these drawbacks do not exist on the Fripoli-Homs Railway, the railway passes through an easy valley to Homs without any heavy gradients, so whatever freight there may be on the line it can be rapidly and promptly disposed of, and the distance from Homs to Tripoli being much less than to Beirout the freight rates are much lower to 1 r th a n to Bejrout. It stands to reason, therefore, with such advantages offered by the Tripoli-Homs Railway, that all traffic, as far as it is within the Homs centre, which radiates at the very least to a distance of 400 kilom, will be drawn to the J npoh-Homs Railway. xr „ 3 er f. severa i 1 well-populated vilayets (about ten of them) along or close by 1JT 11 Homs road, and the whole district served by it is well populated; but the 111 L a fh a ^ the i fu * ure . tr ? ffic hes m the fact tha * all the important traffic, as xvf'l h th i e S rea ter population, is located on both ends of the line, in consequence there \ be al ',T .^ 11 ; f 1 r 1 eighted trains both ways, and the rolling-stock can therefore be made use of to its full extent. Tramways from Tripoli to the Harbour. _ At Tripoli the Road Company has extensive stables for its animals and sheds for storing goods from whence they are either carried by means of a tramway drawn by mules to the harbour or sent up-country. J , v l^roway is about IJ miles long, and carries also passengers; it also H‘ ongs to the Road Company, and pays well. The charge for a single journey from 1 npoh to the narbour, or vice versa, is 1 piastre. Goods Sheds on the Road to Homs. vw 0n , til ® road to li° ms sheds are also provided for storing goods, and stables for the dmerent relays necessary for the freight waggons; at Homs the same is the case. Mail-coaches and Passengers’ Service. There are two daily mail-coaches in each direction between Tripoli and Homs • these arc drawn by five animals, and carry about ten passengers, besides the Government mail and a kind of express parcels service. Seats for this mail-coach must be always looked beforehand, as it is very difficult to obtain a seat unless secured a few days belore the starting of the coach. Future Expectations from Passenger Traffic. The Load Company does not lay great value on the passenger traffic, and carries these only as it is obliged to carry the Government mail. The charges for a journey rom 1 npoh to Homs, or vice versd, are consequently very high, and no free iua , o'a&lt; i e beyond quite small handbags is allowed. 00 °4 There can be no doubt that the future passenger traffic will be a source of great revenue to the future Railway Company, to judge by the amount of persons travelling on all kinds of animals—mules, horses, and even camels—as well as on waggons to be met with on all parts of the road and at the sheds. Especially if a comparatively low fare for third class travellers on the railway is charged, for in Syria, like in all hot countries, very few will walk or ride when there are other means ol locomotion. Transformation of the present Road into a Railway. The present Road Company intends to make use of the existing road from Tripoli to Homs for laying on it a railway track wherever it is possible—only on such parts where sharp curves less than 100 metres radius or gradients steeper than 1 in 50, constructing a new railway platform. By this a great saving in earthworks, masonry, bridges, &amp;c., will be affected, as about two-thirds of the old road can be utilized for laying down on it a track, and one-third ol the road (or about 24 kilom.) will have to be reconstructed, or partly, a new platform made for the sake of obtaining larger curves and lesser grades, and even then the reconstruction of these 24 kilom. wiil be a comparatively easy matter, as the transport of materials owing to the existing road will cause less works and expense than would be the case in the construction of an entirely new railway. Maintenance of this railway will also be much cheaper, as the present road is macadamized; the track will be bedded on a solid platform, therefore no loss of ballast and no settling will have to be provided for, an item to be very much considered on a newly-constructed railway. Taking all these items into consideration, the kilometric price for the construction of this railway will be considerably below that of the usual railways of this class. Gauge of Railway, The gauge of this railway will be the same as that of all other railways in Syria, namely, 105 metres between rails. Labour and Wages. Labour is very cheap throughout the district which is being served by the Tripoli- Homs Railway. The average wages of a workman being about 8 piastres = Is. 7d, a-day ; skilled* w orkmen—masons, smiths, carpenters, &amp;c.—receive twice that amount. Wooden and Iron Sleepers. Wood only is expensive and rare, as it has to be imported. In consequence, wooden sleepers would have to come from abroad ; and in view of the Arabs liking to steal sleepers and use them for firewood, it might be advisable and cheaper to use iron sleepers on the line instead of wooden ones. Station Buildings and Goods Sheds. As the climate is most excellent, and the rainy season only a few weeks every year, all buildings for stations, goods sheds, waiting-rooms, &amp;c., need only be of the simplest kind, with the exception of those at Tripoli, where they are required for administrative purposes as well, and also for the use of the manager and his staff. Pier for Discharging Cargo at Tripoli Harbour. At Tripoli harbour a pier will have to be provided for discharging cargo from the vessels from all parts of the world alongside, and vice versa. Owing to the sufficient depth of water being quite close to land, this pier will not be required to be longer than 300 feet. (This pier is to be constructed by a projected Harbour Improvement Company.)It may be mentioned that, besides a great many sailing vessels, Companies send their steamers to Tripoli:— the following Steamers calling at Tripoli. 1. The Khedive Line. 2. The Messageries Maritimes Company. 3. The Austrian Lloyd. 4. North German Lloyd. 5. Hamburg American Line. 6. The Italian Packet Company. 7. The Russian Black Sea Company. All these steamers carry as a rule first, second, and third class passengers, besides the usual cargo. D Tourists to Balbeck, It must also be pointed out that on completion of the Tripoli-Homs Railway, a great many tourists will make use of this line to travel to Balbeck, where the famous rums ot the temples are, as it is the direct route to Balbeck via Homs. Now, the thousands of tourists who go to see Balbeck must go to Beirout across the Lebanon to Kherack, and from there by a branch line to Balbeck, and then back again, which is a great detour and very expensive. Expected Traffic from the Hedjaz Railway. •n 1 ^ ll . rt ^ erniore » when once the railroad from Damascus to Mecca is finished, which will be in about five years, there is every reason for the greater part of the Mahommedan pilgrims to Mecca, which start their pilgrimage from Damascus, to be expected to travel over the ripoli-Homs line, as the facilities to put these pilgrims on the trains direct from the steamers with which they arrive and transport them over the Tripoli-Homs Railway, via Kherack, to Damascus are far greater and less costly than either at Beirout oi Jaffa, to which ports the Mecca pilgrims must go at present in order to get to Damascus. G Difficulties for Landing Passengers at Jaffa. I he difficulties for landing at Jaffa are at all times great on account of a dan s erous bar before the entrance of the Jaffa harbour, but sometimes it is impossible to land anybody for days and days. Great Expectations in regard to Traffic to and from the Bagdad Railway. A. g « a ^ futur ® is als .° t0 be ex P e cted for the Tripoli-Homs Railway when the Bagdad Railway will be further advanced in its construction, for then the Tripoli- Homs Railway will undoubtedly have to be prolonged to a convenient point on the Euphrates, so as to form a connection between the Persian Gulf and the Mediter ranean Sea, and Tripoli will be the most important point on the whole Syrian coast for transport of goods and passengers from Egypt to the Persian Gulf. No other port can compete with i ripoli on account of its magnificent harbour and its geographical position. Importance of the Tripoli-Homs Railway, according to the British Consul at Tripoli. It is for this reason that Dr. Abela, our British Consul at Tripoli, is so anxious and hard at work to have this railway built from Tripoli to Homs, and in time continued on to the Euphrates, by an English Company; and it is owing to Dr. Abela’s increasino- efforts that the present Road Company at Tripoli is now quite willing to join in with an English Company or Syndicate to carry out this promising undertaking, wffiich completed, other very lucrative ones will follow in course of time.

Sl T* ’ Beirut, November 14, 1907. „ ,, VV dy reference to your Excellency’s despatch of the 22nd October last, relatini? to the Moslem Company (Ezzedine and Company) which is interested in a railroad Horn Inpoh to Homs, I have the honour to report that a number of Moslems, the leader of which is Mustafa Ezzedine, have, according to their account, obtained the promise of a Concession to build a railroad for the sum of 40,000/., half of which is to be paid by a Mr. Skinner, an Englishman, of London, and the balance to be raised bv Inpoli people. The Acting Vice-Consul at Tripoli states that the latter held a meeting last week and the money was subscribed, but, when Mustafa Ezzedine refused to permit the names of some of the larger subscribers to appear in the Concession obtained from the 1 orte, they withdrew their names, and the whole project hangs in the air for the present, at least. Mustafa Ezzedine, who was lately in Beirut, informed me that he visited Constantinople and obtained a promise for the Concession from Tahsin Pasha, through the medium of Nijjib Pasha Melkame, and that the above-mentioned sum of money will be deposited in a bank and paid on delivery of the Firman. Mustafa has also visited England and entered into negotiations with Messrs, mnei, Marshall, and Ramsay. These gentlemen began by forming an An^lo- German Syndicate, which fell through, and they are now making other arrangements with exclusively English capitalists. The distance between Tripoli and Homs is 90 kilom., and the expenses for constructing a railway are estimated at 320,000/., including the costs of the Concession, &amp;c.

Mr. Ramsay to Foreign Office.—(Received September 12.) Dear Mr. Montgomery, Aberdeen y September 11, 1907. I HAVE learned only to-day who are the two hanks that have undertaken to finance the railway from Tripolis to Homs. They are the Deutsche Bank and the Dresdner Bank. Three weeks ago the Moslem Company, Ezzedine and Co., deposited in the Ottoman Bank their share of the price of the Concession, viz., 20,000/. out of 40,000/. The German banks have not kept their engagement to do the same, and I believe that they took up the affair only to prevent it from falling into the hands of a rival, who might build the railway, which would be a most serious danger to their own extension of the Mersina-Adana Railway to Aleppo. Tripolis will easily he made the best sea end of the Syrian railways, and the short railway—80 kilom.—is easy and cheap. The total capital needed for construction and working is only 320,000/., estimated by a good Scotch engineer. The Moslems offer to put up half the capital (or a good deal more than half, if they can get an English registered Company to take up the business). The engineer, Skinner, gives them a very high character for straightforward dealing, and says they have plenty of money, hut they want English associates and English protection. As I mentioned to you, I was under the impression that the enterprise had been taken up in London, until I went to town last week. Then I learned that a German named Ducker, of Frankfurt, representing two hanks, was the person who had taken up the enterprise, and that the Preliminary Agreement had been signed, and the Moslems had deposited at once their half of the Concession money needed in Con stantinople. The Germans made a condition that they should get the whole of the debenture issue, 100,000/., 6 per cent, at 80, the balance of the total capital, viz., 220,000/, to be issued in ordinary shares. The matter now stands in that condition. The Moslems had at first stipulated that no Germans should be allowed in, as they distrust the Germans and dislike them, and now, as things are, they think that the stipulation was a wise one. The railway is one that must he made some time; Nature wills it so. The enterprise is one of great possibilities. Yours faithfully, (Signed) W. M. RAMSAY. [2637 m —2]1 [32133] Mr. H. V. Skinner to Sir Edward Grey. Sir Auf Eichberg, Lauterbach (Hessen), Germany, September 7, 1908. BY forwarding the inclosed newspaper cutting,* I do not infer that the contents of this article are in any way correct, as it may only be the usual spiteful outlet of a feeling which at present so many German papers, even those of a very high standing, have and publish against England. But should there be some truth in what this article states, I think it then my duty, as a true Englishman and supporter of His Majesty’s Government, to state such facts as have come under my personal notice, leaving it to His Majesty’s Eoreign Office to make use of such information as may be considered advisable. The fact that the German Government, in the interest of its trade and commerce as well as its political standard, is making every endeavour to gain the firmest footing everywhere throughout Turkey and Asia Minor cannot be denied, I can substantiate this fact by experience gained through a long sojourn in Asia Minor, and by keeping in close touch with it yet. It is also a fact that English influence is on the decrease on account of the former, and something ought to be done to recover lost ground. This can be best accomplished by means of railways, harbour works, and enterprises of a similar nature as these. Now, if it is correct what is stated in the inclosed article, that it has been the intention of His Majesty’s Government to build a railway from Alexandriette, with Cyprus as a basis for this undertaking, I should like to point out that though such a railway to the Persian Gulf could not be well constructed by the British Govern ment, it could be done easily enough by means of a British Company, if instead of Alexandriette the town of Tripolis were chosen as a starting point. Tripolis is far more suitable for this purpose than Alexandriette, on account of its harbour being the best on the whole Syrian coast, and which, with a comparatively small outlay of capital, could be turned info a most magnificent harbour capable of holding the largest fleet, whereas Alexandriette is anything but a good harbour. The distance from any point of Cyprus to Tripolis is also much less than to Alexandriette, which is clearly an advantage. There is at present an excellent opportunity for carrying out the aforesaid railway by taking up the Concession from Tripolis to Homs, and from thence to Deir on the Euphrates, carrying it along this river to the Persian Gulf. This Euphrates Railway, as it might be called, would in a great measure counter balance any advantages which the Germans may derive from the construction of the Bagdad Railway, and it will have the greater advantage, for whereas this railway has no open seaport, Constantinople being a closed port, the Euphrates Railway has as its starting point a splendid harbour on the open sea, the Mediterranean, which is only a few hours distance from all the EgyjAian ports and the Suez Canal, making the harbour of Tripolis and also the railway of immense strategical value in times of peace and war for obvious reasons. The importance of its commercial value, once the Mediterranean is connected with the Persian Gulf, is so great and known so well that I need not make any further comments upon this point. The question how this undertaking is to be accomplished, I will briefly answer thus:— Influential people in good financial positions in Tripolis approached me (vide annexed letter*) last year to take up this scheme and form an English Company. I took this business to a firm of very high standing in London, i.e., Messrs. Carlton, Greig, and Co., 16, Tokenhouse Yard, Lothbury, who thought of carrying it out jointly with a well-known contractor, Captain Lowther, brother of the Speaker in the House of Parliament. UnfortuDately the business fell through for some pecuniary reasons. Not priuted. 28 /&gt;-!]The capital required for the first section from Tripolis to Homs, 60 miles in length, is circa 400,000/. The whole line from Tripolis to the nearest point on the Persian Gulf, which is Bussorah, or if navigation up the Euphrates is possible as far as Kornah, will be about 1,000 miles long, and taking 8.000/. per mile as the probable cost of construction, a capital ot more or less 8,000,000/. will be necessary to complete the whole railway, including harbour at Tripolis; but there is no doubt that the railway in the hands of an English Company would not only be of the greatest advantage and indefinable benefit to our country, but would also yield material benefits and profits to investors in time. My friends in Tripolis are quite ready to obtain the Concession from the Ottoman Government and afterwards transfer the said Concession to an English Company, and there will be no difficulty in carrying this business promptly and speedily through, provided the necessary capital can be arranged, which 1 should say ought not to be a difficult matter to arrange if His Majesty’s Poreign Office will undertake to interest those persons who have the command of the money market or are the leaders in it. As I know that it is not advisable for any direct correspondence of any kind on this subject coming to me in this country, I beg to suggest that in case any steps are taken for carrying out this most important scheme, notice cf it might be sent through Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Campbell, K.C.G., Itoyal United Service Institute, Whitehall, who will communicate with me in case it is necessary.
