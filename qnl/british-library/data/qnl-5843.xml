My watch having stopped I have now to go by the Mullah’s which tops Arabic tune. Our total number of hours marching to-day was not more man lOg miles. I judge our hamalat, or baggage Camels, do no more than 2 A to 2 j miles an hour. They go faster in the early morning, no doubt, but in 2 the afternoon the pace becomes a crawl. To-day we seemed to be going more west than usual our general direction being about 240°. Much colder in the earlv morning but grew pretty hot as day wore op. Strong north-west wind. ' &gt;' ■ vY hen we first saw the Shammar- tents 2 Shammaris appeared riding from them; they turned out to be men who had hitherto been accompanying us bS who had slipped away in the dark to visit their tents and, no doubt give mformation aboui us. For, about hours later, we heard shots iu our rear and, shortly afterwards, Athar Barazi and a relative galloped up. Thev were a nice pair and were riding beautiful ponies, a grey and a chestnut about 14-2 hands. I made a remark about these animals afterwards to Duhaiman our Siiammar rafiq, and he told me that Ibn Bashid had got their dam, a famous mare, and was keeping her at his stud in Hail iamous When within about 7 hours of the wells of Al-Gara’a ( we escended into a valley, dropping down somewhat steeply for the first i milp hand^bout^lSiTto^OO d f V n 1 - eyS Y ith ,T ndstone bluffs either pane aoout 18U to 200 ft, the valleys being about i to f mile broad.

We were 4 hours and 10 minutes on this day’s march. Hamud (Athar Barazi’s young brother), Turjim, Sahili ibn Khurairn, and Mauwar al Jansawi came with 5 other mounted men and had coffee. While receiving them the Shagrah caravan began to arrive under its Amir, ‘Abdullah ibn Sadhan. He says that he met a very large Shammar caravan coming from Najd under Ibn Jabrin or belonging to that section of the Shammar. He thinks that they have in all probability been sent by Turki as their people are camped beyond Artawiyah. Hear at every place that Ibn Rashid is now in Teimah ; also that he is now deserted by most of the Shammar. The latter can get nothing from the J^arbalasNajaf-Shmawah line and are very hard put to it for food. All the Shammar say that they wish to take sides with us or, to put it in their own words, to come under the Government, My experience of the Arabs of the Shamiyah (i.e., desert south of the Euphrates) during the last 2 years or so all goes to show that their friendliness to the British is genuine. I think the Bedouins are traditionally pro-British. We have a great name among them for humanity, justice, and honesty. They always say that the Englishman is a man of his word. If he says “ yes ” it is all right and if “ no ”, he cannot be compelled to change his mind, though open to argument. The wells here are lined with stone for about 50 ft. I measured the distance to the water and found it exactly 50 yards (150 ft). There were only about 4 ft. of water in the well (1 of 2 only). The water is brown, but with the clearness of a peat-burn and sweet, though almost tepid. The well’s mouth is some feet above the general level rather like a volcanic lake in diminutive. This shape :—?■ 'j - ■ • \ • , ■ ' : - The hachuring represents paths, of which there are 8 in all. Eight camels can work at the same time drawing water. The wells are said to be of the time of the Prophet; they are pretty sure to be that, if not older. The Mutair own and maintain them, but all Arabs use them. The distance from these wells (AL-Gara’a) to AI-Asafa is 4 hours. Everyone appears to be against our going to Artawiyah, which is said to be a hotbed of Muhammadan puritanism. Hot only is the foreigner unwelcome, put all outsiders are put in quarantine for various periods until their orthod oxy is ascertained. It is proposed, therefore, to water next at Dujani or Gaiyiyah. One of our dullahsce, or water skin buckets, fell down the well. A boy was let down to fetch it up. I gave him a present of R 2. It was a risky business with a rope of uncertain breaking strain but the boy made no demur getting iato an old leather bucket and being loweredTSO ft. to the water’s edge.

We had one or two very unreliable Sham mar rajiqs (friends) with tie and he feared further visits and demands from Earazi and his tribe who are now camped at the Al-Asafa. The Shagrah caravan was a hit worn out and would probably need a day’s rest. I agreed. I think our Shammar rafiq, Ibn Duhaiman, is a suspicious character, having caught him several times whispering or talking apart with the Barazi brothers. His joining us also was very odd. He came to us on our first march and asked what arrangements we had made for him. We said we knew nothing about him and told him to go to the Shaikh. He has never been satisfied since his arrival. Agreed with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz to shake him off on the first opportunity. Fahad al Dhafiri is an old man sent with me by the Shaikh. He is reli able, I think, and most cheery, always singing out the quaint phrase “Shughai Taiyar”, which, he says, he picked up from Colonel Knox when the latter was Political Agent here. We have some Salubis with us. Many things about them and most of all their regular features differentiate them from the Arabs. They may well be a remnant of one of tlm Crusaders as they themselves claim. Salib means “cross” and the word Salubi can be easily understood to signify crusader. They are greatly despised by.the Arabs but have many privileges and can go every where without fear of being plundered. The Kuwait missionaries told me that the cross figures in their marriage ceremonies as one of the emblems or symbols used in the rites. Our Arabs would not water the Salubis* camels till I went to the well myself and persuaded them to do so. Heard from Barazi that the Turks have agents out buying camels from the Shammar and have already secured a large number Ibn Bashid is ^arranging the purchase for them. Have heard of no Turkish nv German officers about. 19th October—Started at dawn ; reached camp, a circular plain shut in by Distance—52 hours, aailes. low hills, after 8 hours’ march.

The Shagrah caravan in 3 large squadrons followed us at about 3 miles’ distance. Khudhayar, the 6 -foot Zanzibar negro servant sent to look after me bv 7 the Shaikh of Muhammareh, had a swelling on his thumb. Had to operate with a penknife ; filled up with boracic and bandaged. After the pus came out Khudhayar had instant relief; hope he gets all right again soon. Last night he slept heside me, suspecting treachery on the part of some Shammar guests of ours. This marching with a caravan is tiring, but it seems advisable m view of our untrustworthy Shammar rqfiqs, to stick to them till we reach the real dir ah of the Mutair. 011 20th October, Marched badly for about 9 hours, trying in vain to be slow Distance—61 hours, miles.

Lately there was a lot of unnecessary talk about the march, and continuing with, or leaving, the caravan, the proper time to start or to halt, everyone having his own, and a different, idea on these points. I deter mined, therefore, to take charge myself and have no more argument or advice. Sooner or later every traveller is compelled to do the same, however slight may be his experience of travel in Arabia ; otherwise, there are disputes from which all sorts of little troubles arise. The result of my taking charge as caravan leader has, so far, been satisfactory. We had a good 3 or 4 hours’ march before daylight and the camels came on gaily all the way. Marched from 2-15 p.m. to 8-45 p.m. ; met small body of Shammars, taking goods to Artawiyah. They collided with us on our route at night and there Was a lot of drawing rifles and very nearly a row until we separated.

The upkeep of this well and garden worked out at 100 dollars a month, so my host informed me. The local opinion of the present political situation is that Bin Saud and Tbn Rashid have some sort of understanding though Bin Sand and the Mutair are on their guard against the ‘Ajman, who would have been left completely in the lurch had not Salim given them an asylum in his territories. This understanding is believed to be in the nature of a truce. Bin Saud may think that the Central Powers will be the eventual victors. He does not relish the idea of being driven out of Hasah should the Turks return, but, on the other hand, he believes that if we are victorious it Mill not be long before we take control of all the Arab littoral of the Gulf, including Hasah. If the Entente Powers succeed Bin Saud will have to take a back seat as regards His Highness the King of the Hijaz and this would be a more bitter pill for him than even the loss of Hasah. He is, therefore, sticking his toes into the ground; jealousy of the Sherif, jealousy of Kuwait, and religious and racial jealousy of our conquest of Mesopotamia are causing him to veer round. There is a revivalist Islam movement in Riadh and Artawiyah. How far Bin S£ud and his father are countenancing it can only be guessed at; but he might find in it the weapon that he is looking for to get even with the Sherif. Bin Sand’s hostility towards Shaikh Salim of Kuwait for harbouring the ‘Ajman is a factor not to be lost sight of. Quite possibly Kuwait, which is the lever of Qasim, will prove an invaluable counterweight to any hostile combination in Najd. If Bin Sand should throw us over Kuwait could bring us into relations with the Shammar and ‘Ajman and enable us to use them for our purposes. Bin Sdud complains that we harbour the 'Ajman, his enemies, whilst he, faithful to the letter and spirit of his agreement with us, will have nothing to do with our enemies. This is probably the line he will take with us. We should get him to take Hail if he wants an increase of allowances. The above reflections are the result of my talks with the Zilfi Amir, a man of great independence of character, who talks unusually freely about local politics. 28th Ocfo&amp;er.—Started at 7-15 a.m., reached the Nufudh in 20 minutes. About 1-| hours from Zilfi reached 3 “«r/-TempT 5 '; mi ' ei ' patches of palms, a largish garden. Nakhl al Hamthiyah is its name. Water about 15 ft. below the surface drawn by small cattle. Another \ hour or so further on came on 2 other gardens, the further being pretty large and protected by 3 towers. Water is so near the surface that, once established, the trees need no irrigation. I made out the water about 10 ft. below the surface. Water in all these gardens is fresh and plentiful. Halted at 11-30 a.m. Ibn Huhaiman again gave trouble, coming up to the place where the Amir of Zilfi and I were seated on the ground with Mullah ‘Abdul 1 th, and putting down the shirt, drawers, and chajiyah I had given him. He said ;Hiey were too small meant for a boy, not for a man. The act done before the Amir of Zilfi was an impertinence and I told him so. He, therefore, began to abuse the Mullah and all concerned. I must get rid of him either at once or from Buraidah. Left our resting-place at 3-30 p.m. At about 4-45 p.m. passed 2 long valleys, that to the right called Saidaniyah and to the left Maarah near which is a road leading to ‘Anaizah. Half an hour later we began to descend the Nufudh into a wide plain covered with shrubs. Here the Amir of Zilfi, who was guiding us, pointed out the landmarks; on the right, Burmah ( ^ ), a dark hill of no great altitude but very conspicuous in the slight undulation. The plain in front of us they call the Mistawi ( ^‘wJI ). The Mistawi is that long, level valley which runs south-east to near Riadh on the western side of Jabal Tuwaiq. This is the quickest route to Riadh but is through the wilderness up to Sudus. We reached the foot of the Nufudh at 6 p.m. (just after sunset) when we alighted for prayers and coffee. Proceeded thence on level, with plenty of camel grazing, until 9-15 p.m. when we camped in a hollow. The Nufudh between Zilfi and Buraidah is very green with the shrub athar ; plenty of grazing.9 tender. He lias a look of his father, but is of quite a different build, being light and rather fragile. I asked him about his grand father, Abdur Eahman’s, health and learnt that he was well. 31st October, Buraidah .—Turki came at about 8-15 a m., accompanied by the G-overnor of the town, ‘Abdul Aziz bin Jaluwi ( ), and Abbas al Falaji ( ), commonly referred to as Abbas “Beg”, leading about 100 horsemen, mostly African slaves. Before coming to the camp they galloped past me as I stood by a tent peg, firing rifles and revolvers, waving swords, and looking very warlike. I pretended to be duly impressed with this childish fantasia, which was intended as a special honour to me. Afterwards we had a mejlis in a large reception tent which Turiii had had pitched for us. Tea, coffee, and biscuits were partaken of and then Turki, with the abovementioned personages, adjourned with me to my private tent to discuss business. Ibn Rashid is at present in Madinah with Fakhri Pasha, while Ibn Lailah is at Damascus with Jamal Pasha. Turki says Ibn Rashid has only about 400 men with him, but can always assemble the Shammar in case of urgent need and it is not possible to take Hail by a coup de main. The two main questions which I had to put to lurki were :—(1) why he gave the Shammar caravan a letter to Shaikh Salim for niusctbilah at the end of September, and (2) if it were possible for him to take Hail at this time when Ibn Rashid is obviously so weak. As regards (1) Turki says he only gave the Shammar a slip of paper addressed to all and sundry intended to be for a safe conduct among his tribes lest they should interfere with or attack them. He never meant to give them a pass for mmabilah on the way to Kuwait. As for (2) capturing Hail he said that, in the first place, it would not be possible to gather his powers rapidly enough to take Ibn Rashid by surprise, and, secondly, he knew that there was one vi'lage or suburb of Hail which was strongly fortified and garrisoned by the Turks. His orders from his father were to seduce the Shammar and prevent them returning to Ibn Rashid while keeping the Mutair from raiding tribes which had sent quotas to fight under the Sherif. Neither answer is really satisfying. The fact is that an informal truce exists among the tribes of both parties. Bin Baud’s policy is evidently approved of by all. The Bedouin’s one idea at the present moment is to share in the rich harvest of British subsidies and the profits of blockade-running. 1st Aovm&amp;er.—Rode in early morning to S. W. of city through palm gardens and on our way home had coffee with one Ibn Bahush. I offered to go and call on - Distance, 141 hours, At dawn —Temp. 56° miles. Bar. 3,325'. Turki to take my leave, but received a message from him requesting me to stay in camp until the afternoon, when he would” himself come and start me on my way. Waited till 4 p.m., when he 3 ame out with all his horse, including the Governor, ‘Abdul ‘Aziz bin Jaluwi, the Arafah (Salman), and another. Was very pleasant and rode with me for mile, when he requested leave to return. He said he had just received word from his father sanctioning his return to Riadh as soon as he could be relieved by Fahad ibn Maamar, the former Governor. I am glad I did not meet that * surly individual *. Buraidah people struck ! me, however, as not unfriendly; on the contrary, they appeared glad to see me and were more frank than the Zilfis. Nevertheless, I hear from.my entourage that :hey are really inclined to be fanatical, though the palm for fanaticism must now be given to Artawiyah, where all the elect have migrated. Buraidah bazaars ire most disappointing. The place struck me as under some evil spell and as most unprogressive, badly built, dirty, and generally uncared for. The inhabit- mts have no great love for Bin S&amp;ud or for Hail either. * The account of him given by Raunkiaer borne out by bis reputation. Marched till 8-25 p.m., crossed the Wadi Rummah at about 7-55 p.m., and seemed to be continuously in the vicinity of date gardens till the last 2 miles. Halted on the height overlooking ‘Anaizah. 2nd November. —Descended to lower ground by a stony, but not very steep, path and was met by the nephew of the Amir and 2 messengers. It appears that I % \ 46 F. &amp; P. I).-^rmsnz::; *wr. .. r ..^: '“it 10 was expected yesterday and that the Amir and principal people had ridden to the outskirts to meet me and stayed there till midday. I apologized, explaining that my detention was due entirely to Turki’s asking me to wait. Had breakfast with ‘Abdullah al Khalid al ‘Abdullah, who succeeded his uncle ‘Abdul ‘Aziz al ‘Abdullah this year. Had coffee and tea at houses of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz al ‘Abdullah Al-Hamad, Abdur hahman ibn ‘Abdul ‘Aziz binZamil, all of the Beni Salaixn, a most courteous and refined family. They seemed to be men of the world more enlightened and civilized than any Arabs I have met, and with a charming frankness and independence of manner. They are ideal hosts. ci, ? bn I(iris met me on the wa y- He bad just come from the onent s son, laisal, at Ak tbah. ‘A ! )dul ‘Aziz bin Hassun tells me he was present with Shakespear at the fight at Jarab, where he was wounded with a sword on the shoulder and left for dead. He was eventually picked up by some of Bin baud s men and carried in 2 days Artawiyah to Zilfi. When sufficiently, recovered, he joined the Sherif who at that time was on the side of the Turks After the Sherif had cast off the Turks; our friend continued in his service He spoke a lot about Lawrence with Faisal at Akabah and said he was almost like a Bedouin-all the tribes knew him. Najdis were all called A°*aili down south and received pay from the Sherif at the rate of £ 6 a month Those employed on “ dynamite ” operations for destroying the railway sot £15 per mensem. At least 1,00&lt;&gt; men, he said, haye gone from here to assist the bherif and about 4,000 from Qasim have gone also to the Hijaz to earn pay. News is that Ibn Rashid left Madinah and w^ent to Al-Hiir. I do not al together agree with the “Handbook of Arabia” regardingits comparison between Buraidah and ‘Anaizah. ‘Anaizah is a handsomely built town. The aristocracy are mostly related and very united. Their corporate life is like that of a medioeval Italian republic, with their elective Amir chosen from the nrineelv nouse of Bin Salain. Buraidah is larger if the environs and suburbs are taken into account and is, perhaps, more populous. My own belief is that Anaizah has at least an equal settled population and its bazaars are infinitely better m every way, the shops larger, better stocked and kept As for the people there is no comparison ; the people of ‘Anaizah are by comparison highly cmhzeffi The best of them have travelled at least to Kuwait Bahrain Basrah, Karachi, and Bombay, while many of them have gone far afield to the west and are acquainted with Damascus, Beirut, and Constantinople. • P arfc y 10 dollars each to spend in ‘Anaizah. The Amir invited us all to lunch and dinner. Our Bedouins ate enormously the fond i'' le “ T ' , ^ noth^g worth ruyi^.lmt 5 was 'agam'^^mck^thAe Scturtqufand 1 tX imposing architecture of the palazzos of the great ones, with their adiac™nt gardens all highly cultivated, the walls being covered with vines and surrounded by fig trees, pomegranates, peaches, etc. Some of the gardens- looked as though they would afford delightful retreats in sultry weather On the whole, Anaizah is a place to rave about when you come in from the desert. It is quite unspoilt by contact with modernism. I should sav there were no paupers ; I saw no signs of squalor. The state of civilization of Anaizah shows that the Arab, even when left entirely to himself and almost isolated from the world of progress, does not altogether let himself go but retains some ideals and aspirations. He does not become brutalized o£ insensible to the amenities of life and social intercourse or, generX to the softening influences of comfort and elegance. Some of the rooms of the houses I was shown through were beautiful. One, a coffee-room of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz W ft W, A r’ 7 as , P artlcularl y artistic. It was about 18 ft. broad and 30 it. long. Hound the room were open corridors and the room itself had a gallery, with a grille under the roof, a sort of promenade for the lad es who come to see and hear what goes on in the coffee-hall below. Some torts fiom the Quran were artistically painted on the walls on rough moulding- in the luminous gloom the effect was very pleasant if bizarre The utter absence of symmetry, or line, rather offends the European’s eye but these Inteli°is fascinated me and, after all, any attempt at symmetry would have11 Distance—146 hours, 10 minutes, miles. Distance—153 hours, 383 miles. Temp. 64°, Bar. 3,200'. been out of keeping with the general outside and inside designs. I never saw a plumb line outside or inside nor any striving after balancing or matching things. ‘Anaizah is like a gem roughly cut by the hands of some barbarian workman ; yet the result is such that one would on no account have the gem recut in modern fashion even were that possible. Abdullah al Hamad came after sunset to bid me good-bye. He is a nice fellow* 3rd November .—Marched at 6-55 a. m. and halted at 10-5 A. M. Sent on Mutlaq al Naimi (Mutair, sent by Turki) along with Muhammad ibn Dahabas, to convey a letter to the Shaikh of Mudhnib, Fahad Agaili, informing him of our intended arrival at the town to-morrow at daylight. Our general direction to-day was S. S. E. over hard ground, stony, with very little vegetation for the most part ; our landmarks, two cliffs on the right of the road, from which it is said to descend direct on to the palms of Al-Mudh nib. From our halting-place through a gap on the left of the road to Mudhnib (N. E.) saw a depression with palms which are said to be Aziziyah village. Last night *Ali al Dhuwaihi, who is continuing along with us to Riadh, said he had high fever and might not be able to start next day. He had, however, recovered sufficiently to travel to-day. We are taking it pretty easy and the weather is delightfully fresh. Started at 2-55 p. m. and pulled up at 4-55 P. M. as we did not wish to reach Mudhnib before morning. We got to within about 2 hours’ distance of Al-Mudhnib and camped in a hollow with sparse arfaj and other grazing shrubs for camels. 4th November .—Started at 3-10 A. m. and got to a place near Mudhnib&gt; marching still over undulating, stony ground ; waited for sunrise and then started to town and met 2 riders sent out by the Amir to meet us. We went to his place and there had tea and coffee. The coffee-hall was a long, darkish room with a large firepit at one end, in which stood 8 or 9 large coffee-pots. As usual, plenty of carpets and a cushioned corner to the right of the hearth looking down the hall. Con versation for about an hour, and then went off to our camp to dress and wash. Some talk about Shakespear, who passed through here in the spring of 1912 when returning from Riadh. The Amir tells me that Bin Saud makes this a regular halt when passing backwards and forwards to Qasim. The route by the Mistawi is more even going and better for camels as far as grazing is concerned, but this way “ through the villages ”, as they say, is nearer and has the great advantage of plenty of water at short stages, and supplies. But if I return I shall go by the Mistawi. One marches better in the desert; these villages lead to lounging and general carelessness in one’s followers. As for safety there is not much to choose between the two for a small party. A large party, say of 20 riders, would, however, be absolutely safe by this route and not so by the desert way. Tribes have to be feared on the Mistawi and robbers in Woshm. Mijdhnib is more like an Indian village than an Arab one. The soil is all clay and absolutely flat ; there is no trace of sand anywhere. Large standing fields of millet and barley; gardens scattered around. .-The village is not fortified but has a single qasr. I am told that they have no enemies to fear. Over 100 of the inhabitants have gone to the Hijaz to take service under the Sherif. Fahad ibn ‘Abdul Karim is a charming personality. He is about 40 years of age, has been 25 years Amir of the place, succeeding his father as a lad of 15. He has never travelled. There are 30 houses of Agail, mostly Beni Tamim stock. One fort in town ; villages surround the town to a distance of 2 miles. The population under 3,000. I offered the Amir a present of a smart aba and 70 dollars, but he absolutely refused to take anything, saying that as the faithful servant of Bin Saud he could not do so without the latter’s permission. This is unusual, I think, as both the Amir of Zilfi and Abbas al Falaji accepted the 70 dollars which I gave them. I forgot, perhaps, to mention that the whole party with me, including men from Kuwait and (3' ■ w- rfTTW'.. ••' 'A'vi'ti * k *:iuk an, 12 Turki, received 10 dollars each as pocket money to Distance—161 hours, 60 minutes, 417 miles.

Stony cliffs enclose the depression ; its apparent openness to attack on all sides is also a noticeable feature. The inhabitants answered my “ Salaam-Alaikum ” (j*%U ) smilingly. I observed no surliness, but this is due to the fact that lam passing’through the country as the honoured guest of Bin Saud and accompanied by his special messengers, Bami al Bair (.**01 and Sa’ad Ajmi. J The water of this place is salty and aperitive. No one drinks except from one well at Qasr Ibn Saud. That water, which is about 45 ft. below the surface, is really good and sweet ; the best we have drunk since leaving Kuwait. Keft at 1-25 in the afternoon, and halted for ^ hour at Qasr Ibn Saud, which is \ hour’s march from the town (about H miles). We reached Murabbah (^f) at 5-10 p. m. Bth November. Left camp at 5 A. m. and came within sight of Ain as Suwaimi and halted for breakfast at 10-10 a.m. All day long passed through g 0 °d camel pasture, now and then coming on patches oi green. The depression appeared to extend about 7 or 10 miles to t e west. Passed Qasr al Amar about 9-25 a. m. at a distance °f H miles from the road to the west. Kasr al Wuthailan ( .HbJJ) (small tihal bushes) a little further on. ^ ' y J ' Started again at 1 p. m., having sent on Thami and Mirshid to inform the Amir, Dakhilullah, of our arrival before sunset. Reached Ain al Juraifah at about 4-40 p.m. A horseman came out to welcome us. We rode in with him to the village coffee-room, just inside the fort gate, which faces north. Ihisis a compact fortified village with several 2 -storied houses and numerous square towers, all new looking and loopholed. There is a palm garden with about 100 palms watered by the springs which flow through it coming along on an underground channel from a distance of about 1 | miles fc. b. K. of the village. Outside and north of the garden the water fills a ditch with an easy slope in which camels are watered. While here our own camels and those of the Shagrah caravan were watering and splashing about in the lordlike ditch Had coffee and tea and then went to the Amir’s house and had dates, with milk andgr^ee. Afterwards visited gardens. Dined with the Amir in his house; usual boiled mutton and impure water. ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi w T ho had been fasting all day, silly old man, now ate too much.

Shaijar is a larger town than Mudhnib. Beyond Shaijar we saw the ruddy Nufudh and further back the chalklike cliffs of Jabal Tuwaiq. We halted at 5-25 p. m. (sunset), having sent on Thami al Bair and ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi with a letter to the Amir, Muhammad Bin Sand, Al-L^a. He has been appointed Amir by Bin Sand. He is a man about 45 jears old. Came to our tents and brought us off to a good breakfast. Was very hot against the ‘Ajman who, he said, were treacherous ; why, he asked, did Ibn Sabah arid the British Government harbour them? Bin Saud, he told us, claims overlordship over Arabia as far as Najran, including Qasim, Hasah, Mekka, Kuwait, and Oman. The Shagrah market is small, like that of Zilfi, but it is a larger town, surrounded by gardens. It has been well described as a lesser ‘Anaizah. The Amir told us there were 14 large townships in Woshm. Wushaiqir and Shaijar are one and the same ; the name is only a diminutive of Shagrah, of which it is an offshoot. Yesterday had some trouble with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz bin Hassun, who tries to thwart me when he can do so safely. I had caught him the previous day twice chasing my pony away vindictively, following him with a stick and swearing. He began to argue till told roughly to let the horse alone. Now he wants to get even and has been giving a lot of trouble in other ways. I had to give him a severe dressing-down. 9th November. — Marched into Shagrah at about 7-10 a.m. A horseman Distance—iso hours, 35 mmutes, 469 miles. was sent out to meet us.

He says it is about f or f the size of ‘Anaizah and con siders the population to be as high as 15,000. Putting ‘Anaizah at an outside figure of 12,000 I should say there might be 8,000 souls in Shagrah. Had dinner as about 2-40 p. m. with the Amir and then departed, catching up the baggage about f hour later. After leaving Shagrah climbed up the rocky side of the depression and, stopping at the top and looking back with binoculars, had a good view over Shagrah, which lies very low. It is not more than J the size of ‘Anaizah. Has 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants possibly. Bode on to within sight of palms of Tharmidah and halted at sunset, 5-25 p. m., in open patch, putting up some gazelles and a pair of bustard, which Amar tried to stalk; ground hard, country all along Nufudh level, loam plain and covered with fortified granges, looking like castles and called qasrs (castles). 10th November. —Started at 7 a. m. and rode straight into Tharmidah, Distance—184 hours, 35 minutes, 484 miles. having sent Thami and Sa’ad on a head to Temp. 68°, Bar. 3 , 335 '. warn the Amir, ‘Abdul Rahman al Angari, who, it seems, formerly resided at Kuwait. His first cousin was the Amir of Tharmidah when it held out against Bin Saud who besieged it. The cousin was put to death for his resistance. Gardens ©f Tharmidah delightful; water in wells 60 ft. below surface. Saw 2 wells, one with 9 and one with 10 buckets, working; each waterskin drawn by bullock, cow, or donkey, with a short, steep pun down on both sides. Wells here mostly worked by cattle during hours of day only. Some few wells worked by camels as in Qasim. Plenty of maize and bajra (Dukhan) and dux ; some lime trees, melons, pumpkins, and vegetables grow in profusion; air delightful; people look very much of the cultivating class and are said to be mostly Beni Tamim. Outside walls in ruins. At the Amir, ‘Abdul Rahman’s, house had coffee, tea, and dates and then went and spent an hour or two looking at wells and chatting in gardens with Mullah ‘Abdullah, Amar, and Thami. Thami has had 12 wives; all, except 2 , he says, were girls, the other 2 being grown women. He did not keep any of them long. The lad who was with us was the Amir’s servant; very poor; said his only chance of getting a woman was to go on a raid with Bin S&amp;ud, Otherwise, he would remain a poor, wifeless wretch to the end of his days. The Amir is a man about 50 years old and a regular type of townbred Arab, most friendly. There seem to be a good many of the Akhwan about here. My “ Salaam-Alaiks ” were not infrequently ignored.14 There has been some hot air in camp ; ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi has been growling against ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin Hassun and the latter and the Mullah are not on good terms. Thami al Bair shouted out the call to prayers and led the crowd but ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi, who was praying with them, went off hurriedly at the end, saying, in the hearing of all, “ I don’t want any more of this The fact is that Thami is the biggest rip in these parts and he bungled the call to prayers badly. Mirshid went up to him and gave him a lesson ; very funny. And Thami said ‘All right, it did not matter. All the crowd hate and ridicule the Akhwan. I must get a clear account of their tenets. Last night an interesting conyersation with Thami al Bair and Mirshid ; 2 Shammaris who were retainers of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, Shaikh of the Shammar, when they marched victoriously through the towns of Woshm and Sudair. I asked them if Bin S£ud could take Hail with guns—Thami said “ Ho you want the truth ?—yes; well, every mother’s son of us Shammar would come back and help to defend Hail—and ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, with all his talk and his thousands of tribesmen, would never get near the place Mirshid said with a laugh “ Last year Bin Sand had 7,000 men and there were only 1,000 Shammar with Ibn Eashid, but Bin Saud did not dare to attack Hail and withdrew”. Left Tharmidah in the afternoon at 1-25 and marched along parallel to Nufudh among many fortified farms, some of which look rather dilapidated. Cultivation by rain and wells sunk within the forts. Occupied from December onwards, till harvest is gathered. Camp near Nufudh at sunset, 5-25 p. m. There has been a lot of hot air about in camp lately. We are all a bit travel-weary and irritable. ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi is angry with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz because he won’t give him a riding camel and with me because I only gave him 5 dollars at Buraidah. Mullah ‘Abdullah is very wroth with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, who is far from being popular all round. It was a delightful night and not too cold, 11th Novernbcr .—Started at 5-25, about ^ hour before daybreak, and rode hard to Bairah, which I reached in under 3 Distance -187 hours 35. minutes, 51o miles. , mi i /•» i hours. The baggage took exactly 6 hours to cover the distance, which I estimated was about 18 miles, not less. This is the best that the baggage have done yet, their usual all-round pace being about 2 | miles. When pressed, however, 4 or 4| is not hard for them to do for 2 or 3 hours. Had coffee with the Amir of Barrah and coffee with the ex-Amir, who was disgraced and dismissed for taking the part of Ibn Eashid in the struggle with Bin Saud. All the village came in after coffee. Afterwards ate pancakes and butter ; then, after coffee at the ex-Amir’s house, went to camp and had lunch consisting of a cold bustard shot by Amar yesterday with his *303 rifle. A jolly good shot, hitting the bird in the head. The last time I saw the like was last winter on the way to Jaharah when Ahmad al Jabir shot a dove through the neck at 50 yards with a Mauser. Fahad al Dhafiri and Katlan Mutair came to have sore eyes washed. The other Fahad, whose eyes were really bad, got quite well after 2 operations. An inquisitive group of villagers came to ask me if I knew anything about the Sahul. I told them all there was in the “ Handbook of Arabia,” which was more than they themselves had any knowledge of. They were greatly im pressed. Was asked to-day whether it was true that the Daula (the Government, meaning the Ottoman Government) had been beaten out of the field by us— told them we had got hold of Basrah and Baghdad up to Hit. “ Good-good ”, the old man said. The Amir, calling round to my tent to ask me to coffee, suddenly said “ I wished to greet you before but was afraid the Muhammadans might object and, raising my chofiyah, he kissed me on both cheeks—I was utterly taken by surprise and could only say “ God preserve you ”. There are some very remarkable landmarks to be seen from Barrah village. There are cliffs of Jabal Tuwaiq. The bearings from outside the Amir’s house were Attahinah . • • 300° ( HJ). ).

Some of them attained a height ^ of 25 to 30 ft. We halted at 11 a.m. for 3^ hours and reached our camping place on the Sudus road at sunset, 5-30 p.m. A good talk with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, and think I have straightened him up. No grazing between Barrah and the head of Wadi Hanifah. The Haisiyah Shaib has steep, clifflike sides. I saw only one path across them to the right and one on the left. These were mere sheep tracks impossible for loaded camels. Saw some small partridges in rocks. After crossing the watershed we came on to a long plain, ending in the head of Wadi Hanifah. Here, too, begin the extensive and imposing ruins of Al-Aiyainah ( ). This old town was about 2f miles long. The torrent banks are revetted with stone masonry, without mortar, roughly dressed. Many wells, much like those of to-day but with no water in them. At Al-Jubailah ( aJju^I ) is a mud village among the ruins of the old town but the only inhabitant appeared to be an old negro who has a house and a patch of cultivation there. He looks after travellers and is, I think, a guard of Bin Saud’s. 12th November .—Started at 6-15 a.m. and halted at 11 a.m. by some trees at the ruined village of Al-Jubailah Distance—204 hours, 20 minntes, miles. . t \ mi n i {see above). There was one well above this ; here there are two, one of which is at the foot of the ruined village. The water at Al-Aiyainah (one well), is at a depth of 96 ft., at Al-J ubailah 84 ft., at Daraiyah 72 ft., at Biadh 84 ft., and at Barrah about 48 ft. The negro told me that ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin Saud and his escort rode here in 12| hours from Biadh 2 months ago. The cemetery at Al-Jubafiah is very extraordinary ; the graves are exposed on the side of the Wadi by diluvion action. These graves are said to be those of the companions or of the followers of Khalid ibn Walid and other worthies of early Muhammadan times. Plenty of wood-cutters with their camels on the Wadi of Hanifah ; each camelload fetches in Biadh 1 | or 2 dollars. To-day I rode more or less all the time with the baggage, but yesterday afternoon went off with Sa’ad (‘Ajman) Amar, the Mullah, and Pahad Hhafiri. We set up a target, after some private camel-racing in which my camel, usually by far the fleetest, did not distinguish herself greatly. She is a bit tired out I think. The baggage thought we were being attacked and sent on all their riders to help us. Nights very windless ; the days much the same. Only two or three cloudy nights since we left and never one with wind ; always slept in the open. ‘Abdul ‘Aziz bin Hassun complained. This led to a big row (‘Abdul ‘Aziz’s last fight for independence—since then he has been a lamb). Continued march down Wadi Hanifah. The wadi, as it is familiarly called in these parts, is said to rise behind the village of Awainib and Al- Garadan {see 11th November, page 14, ante), a scarp which stands out very promi nently almost due south of Barrah village ( ). Awainib is the fortified village which we passed on our right about 2 miles out from Barrah. I could not make out exactly where Haisiyah ends and where Hanifah begins, but I think it is somewhere in the vicinity of Aiyainah to the north-west of the ruins. Beached Daraiyah about | hour before sunset with | dozen riders and found plenty of lucerne and wood, also, later, some milk and eggs collected by Saud and Ibn Dahibas, who had been sent on ahead. Met a lad about 12 years of age of the As-Saud family who came down to our camp-fire on the wadi bed to chat with us. His name is Hadhlul ( ) w and he belongs to the Al- Jaluwi branch. 13th Started at 6-5 A. M. and reached the outskirts of Biadh at 8-45 a. M. We were met 2 miles out of Distance 207 hem's, 683 mil®. Riadh a t a large tree by ‘Abdul ‘Aziz ibn Babayi and 5 horsemen who gave us the Temp. 58°, Bar. 3190'. i. i ,slui 16 usual exihibition of horsemanship but without letting off rifles. One of them fell off. Beached Biadh ; met at Palace gates and conducted to mejlis^ wher e all the principal Shaikhs assembled. Sat on right of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin Sand, The whole length of the top wall was unoccupied except by two of^ us ; then Muhammad ibn Abdur Bahman, ‘Abdul ‘Aziz's brother, an extremely influential man in Najd, Paisal ibn Baskid (refugee from Hail), Mullah ‘Abdullah, my reader, Salih al Adil, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad bin Saif (of Kuwait), ‘Abdullah Bin Saud, brother of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, and 5 or 6 of the Araif were among the principal notables present. Afterwards went for a private talk in the maktab, or office, of Bin Saud. Then breakfast. At 2 p.m. visited ‘Abdur Bahman Bin Saud, the Imam, as he is generally called, an old man with saffron-coloured beard, about 70 years of age, a charming personage. We were conducted to a bright reception-room, with lofty roof, 3 central pillars and doors at both ends but in opposite corners of the rectangle; triangular windows high up on walls let in plenty of light ; good carpets and cushions round walls. Long conversation, chiefly on general politics. ‘Abdur Bahman is yellow in face, with the dark, clear, inscrutable eyes of the true and wise, resembling remarkably those of Lord Boberts. He is as strongly pro-British now as he was when Baunkiaer met him before the war in 1912. The latter remarked of him :—“ On the last subject, the relative power of European States, especially in the matter of Africo-Asiatic politics, I could do no more than confirm the chieftain’s deep-rooted belief in the hegemony of the British Empire” Most charming and affable to myself ; Mullah ‘Abdullah and all my follow ing who accompanied me have been saying what a fine old man the Imam is. Back to Palace, past the keep, which was taken by Abdul ‘Aziz and his 15 faithful companions in 1910. Saw bullet marks in frame of huge door. There were 70 defenders but these surrendered after 20 of them had been killed and wounded. Long talk with the Amir in his private room; served with tea by a pretty boy. In came ‘Abdullah al Hakim, a young “ medical ” of Mosul, who had got his degree in Constantinojde. Handsome, French-looking, about 30, Speaks French fairly well. Also came Ahmad ibn Thanaiyan of the As-Sdud family. Old-looking young man with “ tender eyes ”, as the Bible hath it, understands French very well, was born in Constantinople. The Amir suspicious about me ; wants to know r if I come to find out all about him and to criticize him :—“ What do we want of him ? He has carried out all he promised, wlrch was to neutralize Ibn Bashid. But fcrhis(B. S.) menace, the Sherif would not have been in a position ever to rebel against the Turks ; Ibn Bashid would have put a stopper on any movement of his in that direction. So the fact that the Sherif has been able to keep the field so long against the Turks (even if his early success had been possible otherwise) is due to Bin Saud’s neutralizing the power of Ibn Bashid. Yet Bin Sdud’s action is not given proper credit by us. He has to hear himself traduced, people even saying that he is secretly helping Ibn Bashid to hold out against us—because he is supposed to be jealous of the Sherif. If he were so, which is not the truth, there would be some reason for his jealousy. The Sherif has secured a great position, he has got hold of the Harb and Ataibah tribes which belong to Bin Saud and also some thousands of Qasimi—or Agailis as they are called—all subject to Bin Sand. Have we not poured gold into the Hijaz ? Here on this side everything has got dear. Biyals had appreciated (the relative value to the sovereign being dollars in ‘ Anaizah and 6} in Biadh). Camels are dear and clothes too. Bice is now far more expensive than before the war. The Turks in Madinah and Syria are getting supplies through the Shammar and ‘ Anaizah, who have come in to us, and so on, and so on Bin Saud’s complaints are numerous. Money and supplies would, doubtless, put a fresh complexion on matters. We spoke about Ibn Bashid and the possibility of knocking him out. At first Bin Saud said it was an impossible task. “ Ibn Bashid was a Shaikh of a single, powerful tribe which would unite at once for self-defence in case of Hail being attacked. He ( Bin Sdud) could, of course, call on his tribes—the Mutair, Ahl-Murrah, Dawasir, Subai, Ataibah, Harb, Beni, Hajar, Beni Khalid, Dhafir, ‘Anaizah, etc. All of them would gather at the bidding and would be a large mob, difficult to control oyto keep concentrated for more than a few days in one locality. So that anything like prolonged operations against Hail with such levies was not to he thought of. Besides the business of getting these numerous clans together he has to arrange for the safety of his provinces of Qasim and Hasah and to leave strong Governors of his family with sufficient garrisons. A revolt of the hl-Murrah or an attack by the Ajman might prove disastrous if it took place while he was far away with all his fighting men. Thus, the first thing to he thought of when planning a distant operation would be the internal defence garrisons. The Sherif’s system of paying a monthly wage to individual Arabs of £6 a month, or whatever the amount, was tantamount to making mercenary soldiers of them; this was not, in his opinion, an expedient method for him (B. S.) to adopt. His tribesmen were Mujahidin who served and fought for honour, not for pay. However, he could easily do the same if necessary and, perhaps, accomplish better results. But with his subsidy of £5,000 per mensem it was impossible ; all he could do was to keep a force in Qasim to check the Shammar and keep his tribes in hand. If he were to attempt to overcome Ibn Bashid he must have all the means required. He did not Avish to share the fate of the English General who, he says, was sent Home a prisoner for having attempted to take Baghdad with inadequate troops and material ”. I told him that the object of the mission of the officers now on their w r ay from Hasah is to discover a plan for his effective co-operation with us and the Sherif in the work of expelling the Turks from the Peninsula, Doubtless, we w 7 ould be able to hit on some arrangement after discussion. But what was his idea ? He said: — Firstly .—The economic question. He should have control of all his tribes in the matter of musabilah (access to markets) at Katif, Qatar, Kuwait, Zubair, Basrah, Khamisiyah, Suqual Shuyukh, and the Euphrates, including Najaf and Karbala. He would keep his agents there; one agent in each market town, who alone would be able to recommend grant of passes to the blockade officers therein. This would force the Shammar, northern ‘Anaizah, Dhafir, and others to turn to him and then a few months might make a great difference. Secondly .—He must have more pecuniary support. 14th November .—Went to the office of the Amir, w'here was an informal rr .roo t, vnarv mejlis, at which I talked with the Amir Temp- 72 . Bar. 2 760 . ^ for about f hour. Many subjects-the Balkans, Bussia, the submarine campaign, Shakespear’s refusal to believe that there could ever be a European war again, and how he show ed him a quot ation from the Quran, or the tradition that Muhammad had foretold this world- conflagration. Some talk about Jesus’ return ; how the Muhammadans do not believe him to have been crucified but to have ascended into heaven to return on the last day. Then w T ent out into town and visited some shops. Saw a few jibbuns and handkerchiefs, but nothing of good quality. Inspected camels and visited ‘Abdul ‘Aziz and the Hamlah, who have a house at the end of the Suq. Had coffee with them. Saw ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi there; he referred to my leaving bim in the lurch when we came into Biadh. Poor old man ; he cannot keep up any pace at all. After breakfast worked till 1 p. M. Slept half an hour aud then w r ent out for a ride to one of the Amir’s gardens with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz al Babayi ( ) and 2 other horsemen. Had coffee in the garden. Saw the splendid well; but water about 100 ft. below surface worked by large donkeys w orking up and down a ramp on both sides ( ). Cost of upkeep of well about 200 dollers per mensem. Fruit teees of all sorts, chillies, and egg plants. Bode back. After supper, with our company, the Mullah and the rest went off to prayers in the mosque in the Palace. I sat writing until 8 p. m., when I w r ent over to Bin Sand’s private room and stayed till 10-25 discussing politics. Bin Saud told me of a wonderful dream he had about the capture of Damascus and its destruction by him. He said he thought that with some help he and his tribes could capture Damascus. I said that was a splendid idea. Of course. Hail and the Shammar stand in the w r ay. Ibn Bashid cannot be bought; of that'•t- ; ^w^’:a iJL .V 1 i m 18 Bin Saud is certain. Nor can lie be brought over to onr side because it is the fundamental policy of Hail and the Shammar to lean on the Turks so as to remain independent of Najd. loth November .—Attended mejlis in Bin Spud’s office. Sat next to Paisal ibn Rashid, the fugitive; beyond him was Ibn Earun ( ^&gt;1 ) [ Abu Daylight—Temp. 70°. Hamdi ( ,j| ) as he is called ]; and his nephew, Musa ( ); another nephew, Sabri ( ), is also in Riadh. Sabri has a fair beard and is very German-looking. Ibn Famn is a small, fat man of about 40, with a limp. Musa is tall and dark. Ibn Farun used to be a great friend of Bin Sand’s. The latter now keeps him as a prisoner, but allows him some liberty. Many people say that the old friendship between them still continues, sub rosa, and the confinement of Ibn Farun is a mere pretence. The Amir was not keen on my seeing him in my rooms. Had a long talk with ‘Abdullah al Hakim and Ahmad ibn Thaniayan. At 2-30 p. m. went for a ride with Bin S&amp;ud and most of the As-Saud family, including half a dozen little boys. Bin Saud led a sort of war-dance on horseback and, after galloping round for about half an hour, we went and sat under a mud wall in the sun while the horses were off- saddled and allowed to roll in the sand. Bin Saud fired 2 shots with a revolver and 10 with a rifle without hitting the mark, except once. A stone was stuck up at a distance of 150 yards. We then came back to the town in procession. After dinner, at 8 p. m., went to the Amir as usual and heard a torrent of talk, mostly against Salim (Shaikh of Kuwait), till 10-30 p. m., when we retired. Bin Sdud seems worried and never gets easily carried away by the exuberance of his word-flow. 16th November. — Mejlis at 8-30 this morning. Found the Amir alone. Letters brought from Hasah;Bin Saud very depressed about Italian re rerses; description of situation by Reuter as capable of resulting in a Rumanian debacle has given him a fright. Our success at Bir-Sheba did not make up for it. After breakfast Ahmad ibu Thanaiyan came and discussed politics. Went for gallop round Riadh—which is a small place—rode out to village of Manfuhah—riverbed of Wadi Hanifah—is very rocky here. Returned to supper, which I still continue to eat with my Bedouin companions. Must discuss camp for mission. Riadh cannot be larger than Shagrah though they say that it is. 17th November. —Had a little fever last night; am sweating it out to-day, Early morning-Temp. 73 °, Bar. 2 , 150 '. W’ent for a ride on camel at 1*45 (Arabic); returned m time to attend mejlis at 3rl0 (Arabic). Met the Amir ; several other members of'the As-Saud family present, also Ibn Farun and his nephew, Musa, and Faisal ibn Rashid. After breakfast came ‘ Abdullah al Hakim and endeavoured to persuade me to put my ideas of what Bin Saud should do on paper. I said that I must wait for the arrival of these two officers from Hasah and see any instructions they might be bringing with them, but that our preliminary conversations had been o| great value, I had quite a good general notion of what the Amir’s ideas were and what he was able to attempt. The capture of Hail is the first, in fact, the only, problem we have at present to face. » The fall of Hail wouMmean, in all probability, the collapse of Madinah. Bin Saud’s main idea is his position in Central Arabia (now and after the war). The question now was a twofold one:—“Was he to maintain his present attitude and carry opt bis part of the bargain made at Kuwait in November 1916 {vide page 11 of prdcis regarding the relations of the British Government with Bin Saud), ie., maintain a force in Qasim of 4,000 men to hold Ibn Rashid in check and attack him, if opportunity occurred, or to take a more active line ? In either case his finances must be bolstered up, but, in the latter case, he would require munitions and money far in excess of his present allowances and on par with the subsidies granted to the Sherif. In fact, we should regard and equip him as a British Division It is obvious that taking a more active part means attacking the Shammar and endeavouring to capture Hail. It would be suicidal to make the attempt without adequate means in money, supplies, armed forces, and war material t£ There cannot be ”, he went on saying, “ the least doubt that but for his attR tude and for his keeping in check not only his own tribes, but those of Ibn Rashid alone made it possible for the Sherif to act with any freedom aa*ain&lt;3 the Turks now ■ ‘ &amp; insi.Bin S&amp;ud is not in the least avaricious; in fact, his fault lies in the other direction, i.e., in excess of generosity. But he must have more money to hold his tribes together. Turki at Buraidah had altogether run out of provisions, such as rice, etc., and that was one reason why he had to leave and come away to Biadh. The monthly cost of upkeep of 4,000 men at Buraidah would not be less than $56,000, or £9, 400 at the rate of $14 per man per month—$6=£1 (the rate in ‘ Anaizah was $5f=:£l). I myself think that £10,000 per mensem and another 3,000 rifles, with ammunition and some light guns, would be sufficient to maintain the present somewhat inactive plan. The cost of large operations would have to be worked out by some other method. The Sherif’s men are paid £6 per mensem, or $36 per mensem. Bin Saud would prefer the system of tribal allowances. If major operations are undertaken who are the enemy and what is their strength ? They are Shammar and Ajman. The Ajman would have to be eliminated first, either by our making a special arrangement with them {e.g.^ to give hostages from every main clan to remain peacefully in Zubair and Kuwait) or by attacking them all round and then taking on the Shammar. Any attack upon Hail would bring all sections together to defend the place. They are a strong tribe. Moreover, they have the Turks close to their back door. In the evening again spent a couple of hours talking to Bin Saud. 17th November .—At 8 a.m. rode out with Bin Sdud to meet Turki. He and his cavalry charged, passed on to the Wadi bed, firing their rifles and pistols and shooting as they passed Bin Saud, who sat on the rim of a 'well in the shadow of a wall. This gallop past was repeated three times and then there were greetings and kissings and general rejoinings. After that I returned to town. Had an interview at 8 p.m. as usual with Bin Sand; discussed tribal matters. Talking about our policy with the Arabs, or for that matter the policy of any outside Power, we should, he hinted, be making a great mistake if we imagined we could mould such unstable material to our will. He compared Arabs to their country ; every now and then there was a great flood {seyl) which swept every thing away—buildings, gardens, and homes—down the wadi. He likes to think that the Sherif’s power is very temporary, built on our largesse only. As soon as the money fails the tribes will return to their old allegiance and look to Najd as the fountain of liberty, secular and religious. Hence his interest in the Wahabi revivalist movement called the Ikhwan. His religious leadership will, he hopes, in the long run carry him on some such wave to the Empire of Arabia—the dream of all the Bin Sauds. 18th November .—Bode in the Parly morning —Temp. 75°, Bar. 2,725'. morning as usual on camel with Mullaln Mirshid, and A mar. Did some photo graphy afterwards. In the afternoon { Abdullah, the doctor, came to talk. Said he had been in Turkish service through the Balkan war ; afterwards deserted out of hatred for the Turks and their despiteful treatment of Arabs in all ranks of life. He fled first to Greece, then to Egypt (6 months), India, and finally to Basrah, where he lived for some time before the outbreak of the war. He was, he said, with Talib Beg at Muhammareh when the latter was negotiating with our representatives there. Now lives at Hasah. Attended big dinner given by Bin Saud to all Shaikhs and people in honour of Turki’s safe return from Qasim. Did not ride in the afternoon.

After dinner had usual long conversation with Bin Saud. He talked for ages; various subjects; I let him run on. Nothing fresh. I dozed several times. 20th November .—Bode in morning to Manfuhah and took photo of the east end of the town; extensive ruins of former town site gradually shrinking Temp. €8°, Bar. ?,660'. ancient walls. o &gt;20 c Got names of towns in 'VYoshm Shag rah ( ) Shaijar ( 8^^') Tharmidah ( ) Al-Qassab ( ) Marat ( ) Athaithiyah ( ) Ghuslah ( aJ—. s ) Fara'a ( ) Waq£ ( (_&amp;»_} ) Al-Haritij ( ) Al-Dahana ( ) Al-Mashash ( ) Al-Barrah ( ) Al-Jarifah ( ) • r- • • 4,000 men. • • • . 1,500 . . 1,500 7) . . . . 1,000 3) . • »• . 800 )) • • t 600 )&gt; . 500 V • • • 500 » 400- • • 400 . 300 • • 300 33 . • 200 39 . . 200 33 Fighting men . 12,000 In the afternoon went for a ride west of the town. 21st IVovmfier.—Picnic given by Bin Sand in my honour at a caye in the Wadi Hanifah south of Biadh.

Beturned in the afternoon. 22nd November. —Went to office of Bin Saud. Dr. ‘ Abdullah came to see me. In afternoon went for ride with Bin S&amp;ud and his family to Shamisiyah; returned at sundown. At 8 p.m. again went for 1 hour’s chat with Bin Saud. He explained that his trouble with Ibn Subah (Kuwait) w T as not really connected with the question of taxation of the Awazim, for, though he did claim the latter as his subjects really, he was content to leave them to Ibn Subah ; the quarrel was really about the‘Ajman. After their going off, contrary to their agreement, and joining with the Shammar to oppose him last winter and spring he could not remain on any sort of terms with them. It was unfriendly of Ibn Subah to harbour them now. He would not hear of any further pardon. It was useless, as we knew, because their Shaikhs were unrepentant. Dhaidan especially was a Turk of the Turks. Either they must surrender some of their chief Shaikhs and go off to help the Ataibah and Harb in Qasim or they should be told to go off to the ‘Anaizah country and help Ibn Hadhdhal. Long discussion on world-politics followed before the last drink of leban of camel’s milk w r as brought—Bin Saud^ signal for bed. 24th November. —Bode in morning to Manfuhah. SAme photography. Ibn Thanaiyah came to discuss politics. Bode in morning wuth Fahad, Amar, and Muhammad ; after breakfast went to coffee with the men in their two houses in town ; looked for curios in Suq. Bode in the S. and W. of the town with Ibn Babayi; discussed the ‘Ajman. Long conversation with the Amir chiefly regard ing tne ‘ Ajman and Ahl-Murrah. Says the ‘Ajman out against him could not possibly muster more than 1,500 men. The ABl-Murrah are now well armed. 2oth November. —Still no news of Philby and Cunliffe-Owen. Attended mejhs this morning ; religious discussion. The Amir again hell forth on heresies and infidelity of Turks. There seems to be a general assent to these sentiments.* In afternoon rode out to the north to the rock archvay on hill called Al-Kkaruq ) with Ibrahim and Khudhayar. Cunliffe-Owen arrived.

Open, stiff, clay ground. General direction N. N. W. Halted by some low bills on east side of road at 2-45 p. m. Some trouble bringing the wnthaihi, i. e., the pair of Oryx Beatrix which Bin Saud presented to me before leaving Itiadh. Two of the boys eventually found the trick, one leading both on a single rope and the other driving behind. Muhammad ^ ibn Hahabas lost his aba (cloak) and had to ride back 5 miles for it. Laris al Hawish, a Shaikh of the Mutair joined us in the evening. 6th Deem&amp;er.—Broke camp 7-5 a.m. and reached the well of Banban ( ) at 8-45 a.m. Banban Distance—14 hours, miles. * g &amp; with plentiful, good Water at about 15 ft. below surface. The qasr is a ruined tower, and round it are some signs of cultivation. Left again at 10-15 after •watering ; general direction N, W. More northerly than yesterday. Plenty^ of sheep and some catt and camels. Also saw many sandgrouse. The cultivators are men of Biadh. There is a pink sandhill at foot of Al-Arumah ( ) called Araidah ( ). The range of Al-Arumah trends towards Wadi Hanifah ( a-aA*. ) J which it heads off beyond Manfuhah. At 11-45 a.m. reached high, rocky hill (about 120 ft. above on right of road) from which good view of Al-Arumah is obtainable. Road rocky, latterly with black patches. Al-Arumah is the same colour as Tuwaiq, viz., greyish clay. The sandhills, or Nufudh, below are pink. The water of Shaib Banban flows from west to east till it strikes the Nufudh which runs about N. W. and 8. E. Thence its flow is 8. 8. E. They say the water of this shaib does not join the Wadi Hanifah but disappears in the sand. A conspicuous object, pink sandhill, during the latter part of our march was bearing about 345° called “ Nigah al Mutawah, Earaj Banban ” ( ). We halted at 2-30 p.m. about 1|- miles short of this orange-coloured, pyramidal sandhill, the Mutawah ( f ), Camped in Nufudh; plenty of grazing during last 2 hours of march; ground stony. 7th December. —Started 6-45 Distance—21 hours, 25 minutes, Temp. 44°, Bar. 3,250'. miles. one boy leads while the other walks Shaib Araij al Banban ( ). a.m., halted 20 minutes for coffee at 9-45 a.m. The wuthaihi {Oryx) now follow the sheep beautifully. They are both tied together with a long rope which behind. Passed up the valley still called ^ ^ Crossed some cultivation, but for the most part we traversed a flat, sandy plain covered with grass and shrubs. We are passing east of the villages of Salbugh (2 hours), Dalqalla (Ig hours), Dhaban (3 hours), Thadiq (2 hours), Al-Hasi (3 hours), As-Sirrah (4 hours). Sudus wa.s about 4 hours from our morning halt. Halted at 2-30 p.m. at end of Araij al Banban. W 7 hite cliffs to front and on right beyond orange-coloured sand strip, which we have marched close to all day. Village of Huraimlah one day’s march on left. Country to left open, stony steppe as far as Jabal Tuwaiq. At 1-30 p.m. crossed water course running close by the sandhills. Our camp was opposite Al-Rhafs ( ) (about 10 w East of North) and distant 1 hour from it. There is a lake at Al-Khafs which after an average flood is full for about 5 months. It is a favourite camp of Bin Sand’s. 8th December-Sent off Khudhayar with 2 men and a letter to Bin Saud saying I was leavieg him w r ith the lame horse. Dabbi and Raja’an went with him to the tent of Bin Sand’s jidawiyahs Distance—28 hours, 25 minutes, Temp. 49°, Bar. 3,175’. miles. 45 F. &amp; P. D,22 about 5 miles to the east. Horse spiked in off forehoof deliberately. The operator had left blood on near foreleg up to knee. Started at 9-25 a.m. The men (Mushin and Mutlaq) whom I sent with the lame pony overnight returned bringing Khudhayar and Eaja’an whom they had met on the way. At about 10-45 a.m. we got clear of the sandbank, called Araij al Banban, .smd crossed an open plain going thence due north towards the Al-Arumah range, making for a gap in the hills which we reached at 1-45 p.m. Here on the right the cliffs are broken down as if by heavy artillery. This is called khanasar (little fingers) (). The whole range of Al-Arumah is extraodinarily like a fort on a hill, such as Chiborgarh and others like it in India. Between 2-45 p.m. and 3-5 p.m. we crossed three watercourses, or shaibs as they are called, viz., Al-Ruaighib ( *-*^1 ), Silah ( ), and Khanasir (). At 3-45 we reached the highest point on the pass when 1 took the barometric reading (3,400 ft.). There were higher domes on the right, perhaps 400 ft. above the road. The valley narrowed now and we came on to a watercourse where we camped at 4-45 p.m. having marched 7 hours on end *. 9th December .—Started at 6-45 a.m. At 7-25 A.M. came in sight of valley Distance — 36 hours, 25 minutes, miles. Al-Ats ( ), At 7“45 A.M. Temp. (F.) 54°, Bar. 3 , 275 '. entered valley which cuts the Al-Arumah range in 2 and is here about 4 miles broad. Our march was over red sand in a northerly direction, the ground falling away slightly to the east. The wells are due K E. from this point on the edge of the Ats_ valley. Many Arabs about, mostly Subai and Sahul. Valley of Ats runs M. S. W. and E. N. E. Splendid grazing, sandy. At 12-25 p.m. began to re-enter range of Al-Arumah from Ats, which here takes a bend to the north, we keeping our direction of 10° East of North. Half an hour later on our left hand are two hills somewhat like a woman’s breasts called Khanadar. Kept on till 2-25 p.m. when we crossed a broad watercourse called Al-Teri (1. Ascended slope and after 20 minutes reached high ground overlooking the wells in the bed of the Ats. The wells, 12 in number, hold good water, 84 ft. of water in evening at this time of year, but as at least 2,01)0 camels have been watering before us the level has probably gone down. Bed of Ats is here black with the trodden dung of ages; water is drawn by camels pulling a rope. Many women seem to be employed on this job. liiey look curious riding draught camels among the men. At the near well o camels were drawing at the same time. Shot some sandgrouse. Hafar al Ats is at least 3 hours south of the nearest Dahanah belt and not as showm on the map in the Dahanah. 10th December. Distance—45 hours, miles.

Camped at 2-35 p.m. on 3rd ridge of Dahanali (counting from the south). Splendid grazing—mostly arfaj, nussi, and some urta. Bottoms between ridges not so level as further westward. I think this is a better road than that via Al-Gara’a and Gaiyiyah by which we went to Buraidah in October. Learnt to-day that the wonderful Ats Shaib commences at Shagrah, cuts through Jabal Tuwaiq, at or near Thadiq, and finally finishes in the Nufudh S. W. of Hafar al Ats. Distance 50 hours, 35 minutes, Dawn —Temp. 55°, Bar. 2,730'. miles. 11th Started at 7-10 a.m.; halted for ^ hour at 8-55 for break fast on the plain below 3rd ridge. Marched across this plain for 1 hour. Crossing 1th ridge reached plain beyond at 11-35 a.m. This plain is about 2 miles broad, fine grazing, not much sign of a road, ground even over ISTufudh quite firm. Met Alush bin Bargis al 'Dawish Mutair and gave him a pair of binoculars and 20 dollars. Bought one hawk and greyhound from % Subai Shaikh for 20 dollars. Subai are very good-looking people. Bidge in front reached at 11-35 a.m. is called Al-Hamrawi ( ). Crmped on 5th ridge at 2-15 pm. 12th Decm&amp;er.—Marched at 7 a.m., crossed 5th ridge and broad plain beneath, marching N. E. (a change from Distance 58 hours, 5mmute, miles. yesterday). This alteration of our course Dawn Temp. 43°, Bar, 2,750 . W as, so the guide told us, in order to hit off the broad Jaham ( ) ridgeat its narrowest. Sand ridges very steep on north side, but, generally speaking, the marches are easier in gradient than further west and firmer and more covered with vegetation, especially with nussi o-rass which is wonderful here. Have not been well last 3 days ; feverish, cold. Yesterday hawked hare and to-day a fat bustard. Halted for breakfast or coffee at 1C-15 for 4.-5 minutes—magnificent grazing in raudha between 6th and 7th ridges. Temperatuie 44° this morning ; cold and drizzling at midday. Had race with Bin Baud’s men for £1. Ghunaim Mutair on my thelul Hamama ” won, Amar being 2nd, and the rest nowhere. Marched till 3-15 p.m. Drizzle all the afternoon and cold. Put up 4 hares and coursed 2 without success, the second getting into a deep hole. Nearly lost the hawk but Mirshid got it back by working a pair of bustard wings and calling “ Thiab-Tkiab ”. Passed the last ridge of the Dahanah and entered the Summan at l-4i5 p.m. The Jaham is the broadest of all the 7 ridges. Such wonderful grazing, camel shrubs, and nussi grass I have never seen anywhere as this afternoon; indeed, these last 3 days we have passed a wonderful grazing country. The northern slopes of the Dahanah ridges are far steeper than the southern. Had dinner in my tent with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz bin Hassun, ‘Abdullah, Mirshid, and Amar to eat the bustard and hare. Most cheery dinner, with plum-pudding, joint, tea, and biscuits to follow the great meat dishes. ✓ Tobacco is much in demand in this bleak weather. Distance—65 hours, 50 minutes, miles, Dawn —Temp. 51°, Bar. 2,550'. Pahad al Dhafiri is a great joke. Always chilly, we find he wears everything* including chajiyah and aba, in duplicate or triplicate. 13th Decemfo?’.— Started as usual at 7 a.m., had coffee at 9-4i5 a. m., came into camp ; still on the Summan at 3-5 p.m. The Summan landscape, stony hills with depressions, like so many huge hoof-marks in mud, sometimes circular but more generally elliptical, with no apparent exits. The bottom is clay and covered with vegetation. A dreary country passed through to-day reminding me to some extent of ptarmigan ground in Scotland. Tried hawk and hound to-day but had no luck. The hares have, all of them, got dee$) holes in the rocky summits of these hills. Hounds o-et their feet cut about by stones. The hawk did not like the weather to-day. It has certainly been bitterly cold and gloomy. North wind and heavy clouds that will not rain. General direction now due north. 14th December .—Started as usual 7-5 a.m. Marched in bitter cold Distance—70 hours, 15 minutes, miles. rain with gUStS of sleet Until 10-15 A. M, Temp. 52°, Bar. 2,360'. when we halted for breakfast(inuin, 2i r Guides said the wells of Al-Habah wery still 3 or 4 hours distant. However, after marching on for about another hour we came suddenly on the hill overlooking the wells. Decided to stop short of the wells as we are wet and uncomfortable and want fuel more than water. There is never fuel nor grazing in the vicinity of important wells. Camped at 12-15 p.m. Have still got the ‘Ajman ladies marching in our wake ; one is an aunt and the others connections of Shaikh Dhaidan ibn Hithlain. I send them food for which they are grateful and daily send thanks. They ride, two of them, in howdaha on theluls, and the third astride. Incredible story brought me by Dabbi to-day that on the day that Ibn Eabayi left us with ‘Abdullah Shammari to go to Riadh he learnt that there were 9 German askar (soldiers) at Riadh. Afterwards, when we had reached Shagrah from ‘Anaizah, the 9 Germans passed us along another route to . Hail. In Riadh he learnt that they had come by ship from the Hijaz. He said that Bin Saud wanted only to make himself strong and was taking all he could from both sides. He meant to make Ibn Sabah (Kuwait) acknowledge his, supremacy and to attack him if he would not comply. Meanwhile, the Kuwait standard is at Gara’a, 2 days this side of Subaihiyah. Dabbi believes that the Subai are out raiding against Kuwait. Of course, Bin Baud’s policy is self-centred. He, possibly, thinks that the Central Powers will get the upper hand, at least in Asia Minor. He wishes to consolidate his power over all the Arab tribes of Najd, Hijaz, and East Syria. Dreams of the restoration of the ephemeral Wahabi Empire of former days undoubtedly are the main spring of his policy, That is why he is fostering the Ikhwan revival at Artawiyah. The Ikhwan are receiving daily accessions. When at Riadh it was the Ataibah ; now I hear that the majority of the Mutair and some Bhammar has been converted. This is a militant Wahabi revival ; they consider any intercourse with Christians to be pollution, while the rather loose Muhammadans of Kuwait are treated a^s misbelievers. Therefore, the Ikhwan are hated in Kuwait. Old Paris al Amaid of the Mutair, however, said that he had not gone over. He, for instance, did not believe in them; he was not going to lie he said. Bin Baud thinks that the Ikhwan wall make a splendid fighting nucleus. They are real fanatics. My reader, ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abdulillah, a very devout Muhammadan who always leads prayers in my camp, and is regarded as a learned Mullah, says that the Ikhwan are ignorant and ilkoonditioned. According to him the worst thing abogt them is their intolerance of their co-religionists, whom they call Kafirs (Yakafarum gkai Musalmin). M y experience of the Arabs here and elsewhere in Mesopotamia is that they regard us as ^ softies. England to them is a sort of fairy godmother, rolling in wealth, kindly, and silly. This attitude does us no harm, no more than the prosperous man’s patronizing of the Almighty harms the latter or deflects him a hairsbreadth from his inexorable designs. As a policy in contrast to that of German frightfulness British softness and apparent blindness has paid us well. We have roped in the whole world thereby w^hile Germany has only secured Bulgaria. Still going over this uninteresting Summan steppe, following what is, apparently, a long valley, but is actually a succession of such valleys, the longer axes of which run N, and S. and thus facilitate our way, forming, in fact, a sort of sunken road ; innumerable paths lead off on both sides. Have sometimes left road for a few miles and everywhere found a network of such paths, any one of which, if followed, takes the general direction of the main road. The main road is called makatti ( ), or the cutting. Many Salubis about but no other Arabs come this way at this time of year. Halted close to peculiar sugar-loaf hill about 250 ft. above surrounding depression and standing in its midst. We are in sight of the wells of Al-Haba from this spot.

We started when all had been watered, a matter of nf •win'oii • i i m ~ ^ There are 2 wells, the position oi which reminds one both of Al-Gara’a and Hafar al Ats, *&gt;., in a sort of25 ■i * arena with an amphitheatre of stony hills of the regular Summan nobby shape. These 2 wells contain good water at a depth of 25 ba, or 150 ft, i.e., the same as Al-Gara’a to the N. W., which we passed on our march to Buraidah. Got off at about 11-35 a.m., but w’ent to the wells to water the horses and sheep, of which 10 only remain of the flock of 20 presented to us by ‘Abdul ‘Aziz (Bin Sdud). Halted at 2-45 p.m. by another solitary sugar-loaf hill rising out of the broad depression. Direction due north, marching in teeth of skimal (north wind), with fine, cutting rain. Obliged to dismount from camel and was so stiff could hardly walk. Walked last couple of miles into camp. Usual dreary Summan scenery but valleys more open than on Kuwait-Zilfi route. Vegetation poor (no nussi), light yellow sand. The sand on the Summan is different altogether from that on the Nufudh, which is extremely fine and pinkish in colour (in the distance orange). Thunder in west. The Arabs say about it that it means a seyl, or flood, at a distance of 2 days. In the summer lightning like that i&amp; only 4 or 5 hours distant. Mahsin, the Imam’s man, told me to-day, apropos of my having fever, that Bin Saud was a great doctor. I said “ How did he heal ?” He said “ By siyasah ; but it was a wonderful thing Am feeling travel-weary ; hence the fever I think. I left Kuwait July 30th for India, rushed about for a month, and then returned via Basrah and Baghdad to Kuwait, whence I started on this journey.

We crossed this and ascended a pass over the range, the second rise of which must be 400 ft. above the shaib level. On top we found a bare, open plain sloping northwards. This was at 2-15 p.m. Camped in narrow watercourse valley, with plenty of camel stuff and coarse grass. Both ponies tucked up from want of sufficient food. Arabs say they do not dream of taking horses across the country at this time of the year. Baining heavily at sundown. Still seedy, my head going round ; took quinine and Dover’s powder. At 11-15 we had passed Salubi tents on our left close to a hill called Hasaniyah (fox-lands), or Um al Hasani, but otherwise saw no signs of Arabs. 17th December. —Marched at 7-15 a.m., and with -|-hour interval.

My watch having stopped I have now to go by the Mullah’s which keeps Arabic time. Our total number of hours marching to-day was not more than 10! miles. I judge our hamalat, or baggage camels, do no more than 2^ to 21 miles an hour. They go faster in the early morning, no doubt, but in 2 the afternoon the pace, becomes a crawl. To-day we seemed to be going more west than usual our general direction being about 240°, Much colder in the earlv morning but grew pretty hot as day wore on. Strong north-west wind. • When we first saw the Shammar tents 2 Shammaris appeared riding* from them; they turned out to be men who had hitherto been accompanying us but who had slipped away in the dark to visit their tents and, no doubt give information about us. For, about 1! hours later, we heard shots in our rear and, shortly afterwards, Atbar Barazi and a relative galloped up. They were a nice pair and were riding beautiful ponies, a grey and a chestnut about 14-2 hands. I made a remark about these animals afterwards to Duhaiman our Shammar rafip and he told me that Ibn Rashid had got their dam, a famous mare, and was keeping her at his stud in Hail, - ® Wheu within about 7 hours of the wells of Al-Gara’a (&lt;*Ain we descended into a valley, dropping down somewhat steeply for the first i mile Thenceforward we moved along stony valleys with sandstone bluffs on either! .rand about 180 to 200 ft. the valleys being about i to £ mile broad.

We reached Gara’a, 2 famous old wells, at about 9-45 a.m. The wells are situated at the head of a valley directly between and under some castle-like sandstone hills. We were 4 hours and 10 minutes on this day’s march. Hamud (Athar Barazi’s young brother), Turjim, Sahili ibn Khuraim, and Mauwar al Jansawi came with 5 other mounted men and had coffee. While receiving them the Shagrah caravan began to arrive under its Amir, ‘Abdullah ibn Sadhan. He says that he met a very large Shammar caravan coming from Najd under Ibn Jabrin or belonging to that section of the Shammar. He thinks that they have in all probability been sent by Turki as their people are camped beyond Artawiyah. Hear at every place that Ibn Rashid is now in Teimah ; also that he is now deserted by most of the Shammar. The latter can get nothing from the Karbala 'Najaf-Shmawah line and are very hard put to it for food. All the Shammar say that they wish to take sides with us or, to put it in their own words, to come under the Government. My experience of the Arabs of the Shamiyah (i.e., desert south of the Euphrates) during the last 2 years or so all goes to show that their friendliness to the British is genuine. I think the Bedouins are traditionally pro-British. We have a great name among them for humanity, justice, and honesty. They always say that the Englishman is a man of his word, If he says “ yes ’* it is all right and if “ no ”, he cannot be compelled to change his mind, though open to argument. The wells here are lined with stone for about 50 ft. I measured the distance to the water and found it exactly 50 yards (150 ft.). There were only about 4 ft. of water in the well (1 of 2 only). The water is brown, but with the clearness of a peat-burn and sweet, though almost tepid. The well’s mouth is some feet above the general level rather like a volcanic lake iq diminutive. This shape :— The hachuring represents paths, of which there are 8 in all. Eight camels can work at the same time drawing water. The wells are said to be of the time of the Prophet; they are pretty sure to be that, if not older. The Mutair own and maintain them, but all Arabs use them. The distance from ' these wells (Al-Gara’a) to Al-Asafa is 4 hours. Everyone appears to be against our going to Artawiyah, which is said to be a hotbed of Muhammadan puritanism. Not only is the foreigner unwelcome, but all outsiders are put in quarantine for various periods until their orthod oxy is ascertained. It is proposed, therefore, to water next at Dujani or Gaiyiyah. One of our dullahsce, or water skin buckets, fell down the well. A boy was let down to fetch it up. I gave him a present of R2. It was a risky business with a rope of uncertain breaking strain but the boy made no demur, getting into an old leather bucket and being lowered,150 ft. to the water’s edge. t This morning was very cold; The pamp was all asleep ; every living thing stretched out on the sandy scrub beneath the stars, except one camel hopping about on 3 legs, the near fore being tied up to prevent her going far afield. We have only riding camels (theluls) even for baggage and can move very rapidly in case of necessity.IQth October —Halted for the day.

We had one or two very unreliable Sham mar rajiqs (friends) with tis and he feared further visits and demands from Barazi and his tribe who are now camped at the Al-Asafa. The Shagrah caravan was a bit worn out and would probably need a day’s rest. I agreed. I think our Shammar raftq, Ibn Duhaiman, is a suspicious character, having caught him several times whispering' or talking apart with the Barazi brothers. His joining us also was very odd. He came to us on our first march and asked what arrangements we had made for him. We said we knew nothing about him and told him to go to the Shaikh, He has never been satisfied since his arrival. Agreed with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz to shake him off on the first opportunity. Fahad al Dhafiri is an old man sent with me by the Shaikh. He is reli able, I think, and most cheery, always singing out the quaint phrase “Shughal Taiyar” which, he says, he picked up from Colonel Knox when the latter was Political Agent here. We have some Salubis with us. Many things about them and most of all their regular features differentiate them from the Arabs. They may well be a remnant of one of the Crusaders as they themselves claim. Salib means “cross” and the word Salubi can be easily understood to signify crusader. They are greatly despised by.the Arabs but have many privileges and can go every where without fear of being plundered. The Kuwait missionaries told me that the cross figures in their marriage ceremonies as one of the emblems or symbols used in the rites. Our Arabs would not water the Salubis’ camels till I went to the well myself and persuaded them to do so. Heard from Barazi that the Turks have agents out buying camels from the Shammar and have already secured a large number Ibn Bashid is ^arranging the purchase for them. Have heard of no Turkish nr German officer^ about. _ - 19th October. —Started at dawn ; reached camp, a circular plain shut in by Distance—52 hours, miles. low hills, after 8 hours’ march. Marched over very rough, stony ground, crossing some water-courses, deeply scoured, apparently by floods. Water appears to flow north. Stiff cloudy. South breeze; very cool. The Shagrah caravan in 3 large squadrons followed us at about 3 miles’ distance. Khudhayar, the 6-foot Zanzibar negro servant sent to look after me hv the Shaikh of Muhammareh, had a swelling on his thumb. Had to oneratV with a penknife ; filled up with boracic and bandaged. After the pus came out Khudhayar had instant relief; hope he gets all right again soon. Last night he slept beside me, suspecting treachery on the part of some Shammar guests of ours. This marching with a caravan is tiring, but it seems advisable in view of our untrustworthy Shammar rqfiqs, to stick to them till we reach the real dtrah of the Mutair. reacn 30th October, Marched badly for about 9 hours, trying in vain to be slow enough for the Shagrah caravan to keep up Eventually, at 1-30 p.m., sent Muhammad . ibn Hahabas with my compliments to the Amir of the caravan to enquire when he intended to halt. His replv wbhK. was polite and florid, amounted to this—that his camels were a rotten lot in bad condition and that he intended halting at the first place where L™li grazing was to be had.

We paid 2 dollars per carcass. Lately there was a lot of unnecessary talk about the march, and continuing with, or leaving, the caravan, the proper time to start or to halt, everyone having his own, and a different, idea on these points. I deter mined, therefore, to take charge myself and have no more argument or advice. Sooner or later every traveller is compelled to do the same, however slight may be his experience of f ravel in Arabia ; otherwise, there are disputes from which all sorts of little troubles arise. The result of my taking charge as caravan leader has, so far, been satisfactory. We had a good 3 or 4 hours’ march before daylight and the camels carme on gaily all the way. Marched from 2-15 p.m. to 8-45 p.m. ; met small body of Shammars, taking goods to Artawiyah. They collided with us on our route at night and there was a lot of drawing rifles and very nearly a row until we separated. Marched 1 hour into the Dahanah. 22ncl Marched from 4-45 a.m. till 11-15 a.m. ; halted Distarce —85 hours, 5 minutes, mii es . in the third intervening valley since entering the Dahanah. The Dahanah has 7 ridges with intervening valleys of clay and mostly thickly covered with shrubs and grass. Came in sight of huge sandhills at dawn, That on the right is called the mutawah (overseer). People are said to hear the echo of the call to prayer by a ghostly mutawah there at dawn. Plies so bad that it is almost impossible to write. Started again at 3-15 p.m., halted 40 minutes for food and prayers at sunset, and then on till 9 p.m. Ghunaim, our Mutair, had forgotten the way so we did not press on to the water. 23rd October .—At 5-30 a.m. just before daylight sent Ghunaim and Ibn Distauce 95 hours 5 minutes, 260 miles. Duhaiman on to the wells at Gaiyiyah. VY e followed and got there about 9-15 a.m. Our caravan very tired after yesterday’s ploughing through the sand ridges that constitute the Dahanah. The guides made Gaiyiyah instead of Dujani as had been our intention. We found plenty of sheep. There are 20 wells, the water is cool and sweet—quite the best we have had since Sirrah. It is about 54 ff. from the surface to the water. Large flocks of sheep and some herds of camels were watering when wn arrived. ‘Alial Dbuwaihi brought me coffee as usual shortly after arrival. % General compass direction from Kuwait to Al-Gara’a—210 , Al-Gara’a to Gaiyiyah—220°. Was visited at Gaiyiyah by Al-Dawish Shaikhs of the Mutair. They begged for presents. I gave away 2 cloaks, having very few presents with me. Got away at about 3-15 p.m. and marched till sunset. Riddan ibn Watwan followed us to our camp. He wished to return to Gaiyiyah after supper but I (declined to allow him to depart before the morning as the reason for his follow ing us up was not quite clear. Set sentries as about 10 days ago a caravan of Awadhim returning from the Haj were attacked by Ataibah robbers and 7 men and some women murdered and some camels stolen.

Several thousands of sheep watering. Albatarah ( ) is the name of this series of wells which are sunk at intervals all along this deep depression, wfliich becomes almost a gorge here with steep cliffs on either side, that on the north being about 180 ft. above the level of the valley.

Marched at 5-45 before sunrise and reached descent into the deep, stony gorge, wdiich forms the entrance into Zilfi. from this direction, about 8-55 a.m. The baggage camels came very slowly. Tins steep place is called Attawaij ( w, ). W e waited for the camels for i an hoar at the first well. There was a small garden attached to the well and a square cover exactly over it. The well was cut into the solid rock the water being about 18 ft. below the surface when we saw it, which was after many sheep had been watered.

He has invited us all to dinner. We halt to-morrow when I hope to see the 2 towns. The new town, which replaces that destroyed by Ibn Rashid some years back, is a quadrangle facing north with 5 towers connected by a curtain, the height of which is about 15 ft. The east and vest sides have 3 square towers, m addition to the circular towers connecting them with north and south faces. We camped at a distance of about' 700 yards from the east face of the new town. The old town is about If miles horn the new one.

The local opinion of the present political situation is that Bin Saud and Tbn Bashid have some sort of understanding though Bin Saud and the Mutair are on their guard against the ‘Ajman, who would have been left completely in the lurch had not Salim given them an asylum in his territories. This understanding is believed to be in the nature of a truce. Bin Saud may think that the Central Powers will be the eventual victors. He does not relish the idea of being driven out of Hasah should the Turks return, but, on the other hand, he believes that if we are victorious it hill not be long before we take control of all the Arab littoral of the Gulf, including Hasah. If the Entente Powers succeed Bin Saud will have to take a back seat as regards His Highness the King of the Hijaz and this would be a more bitter pill for him than even the loss of Hasah. He is, therefore, sticking his toes into the ground; jealousy of the Sherif, jealousy of Kuwait, and religions and racial jealousy of our conquest of Mesopotamia are causing him to veer round. There is a revivalist Islam movement in Biadh and Artawiyah. How far Bin Saud and his father are countenancing it can only be guessed at; but he might find in it the weapon that he is looking for to get even with the Sherif. Bin Sand’s hostility towards Shaikh Salim of Kuwait for harbouring the ‘Ajman is a factor not to be lost sight of. Quite possibly Kuwait, which is the lever of Qasim, will prove an invaluable counterweight to any hostile combination in Najd. If Bin Saud should throw us over Kuwait could bring into relations with the Sham mar and ‘Ajman and enable us to use them us for our purposes. Bin Saud complains that we harbour the ‘^jman, his enemies, whilst he, faithful to the letter and spirit of his agreement with us, will have nothing to do with our enemies. This is probably the line he will take with us. We should get him to take Hail if he wants an increase of allowances. The above reflections are the result of my talks with the Zilfi Amir, a man of great independence of character, who talks unusually freely about local politics. 28th October .— Started at 7-15 a.m., reached About Distance—126 hours, 50 minutes, miles.

I made out the water about 10 ft. below the surface. Water in all these gardens is fr§sh and plentiful. Halted at 11-30 a.m. Ibn Duhaiman again gave trouble, coming up to the place where the Amir of Zilfi and I were seated on the ground with Mullah ‘AbdulBh, and putting down the shirt, drawers, and chafiyah I had given him. He said they were too small; meant for a boy, not for a man. The act done before the Amir of Zilfi was an impertinence and I told him so. He, therefore, began to abuse the Mullah and all concerned. I must get rid of him either at once or from Buraidah. Left our resting-place at 3-30 p.m. At about 4-15 p.m. passed 2 long valleys, that to the right called Saidaniyah and to the left Maarah near which is a road leading to ‘Anaizah. Half an hour later we began to descend the Nufudh into a wide plain covered with shrubs. Here the Amir of Zilfi, who was guiding us, pointed out the landmarks; on the right, Burmah ( ), a dark hill of no great altitude but very conspicuous in the slight undulation. 'The plain in front of us they call the Mistawi ( )• The Mistawi is that long, level valley which runs south-east to near Biadh on the western side of Jabal Tuwaiq. This is the quickest route to Bdadh but is through the wilderness up to Sudus. We reached the foot of the Nufudh at 6 p.m. (just after sunset) when we alighted for prayers and coffee. Proceeded thence on level, with plenty of camel grazing, until 9-15 p.m. when we camped in a hollow. The Nufudh between Zilfi and Buraidah is very green with the shrub athar ; plenty of grazing. r ' jp I m All8 / Distance —136 hours, 35 minutes, miles. At dawn —Temp. 60°. Distance—34S miles.

After | hour’s marching, came on a deep and broad depression with 4 stone pillars built on the cliffs above. This shaib ( ) is called Abu Barcjah. ( Ay y,} ). Muhammad Ibn Rashid came here with his army when he com quered Qasim. We halted here at 10-30 a.m., marched again at 2-45 p.m. until sunset, when we had our usual halt of 35 minutes, then on till 9-5 p.m., and encamped in a charming little hollow in the Nufudh. Going was either over the level or among hummocks. At about hours before sunset we came upon a deepish depression, running, where we entered it, about due N. and S. Here were a long strings of villages and walled gardens, which we perceived as we climbed the opposite hill. Sandhills, or Nufudh, extended as far as the eye could reach in both directions. The village we descended into is called Shima- siyah. We watered our camels at a conduit of water drawn from a well about 70 to 75 ft. deep. An excellent photo of this well is given at plate LX in the “ Handbook of Arabia ”, volume I, and is mentioned by Raunkiaer in his book “Across Wahibiland on camel back”. The water was sweet but luke? warm. The descent into this long valley is steep and rocky on the eastern, or ^ilfi, side and equally steep, though soft and sandy, on the western slope. 30th October. —Started at about 7 a.m. after sunrise, sending on 2 riders to inform Turki Bin Saud of our arrival. When within a mile of the fort, or qasr, of Buraidah we were met by a troop of horse under Abbas “ Beg”. They came up at a gallop while we halted on our camels, and gave us a display of horsemanship, letting off their rifles and curvetting round us. Their mounts looked well, but were small, few of them more than 13-3 in height. A spare horse was brought for me, but I had my own animal. We rode through the town gates and then into the fort, which is an imposing structure standing on high ground. It has 6 square towers and is machicolated. We dismounted and were led up 3 flights of mud stairs to a room about 30 ft. long and 16 ft. broad with roof of rough ithal beams. The floor was deep, soft sand. As I entered, Turki Bin S£ud walked quickly towards me, shook hands, and spoke very cordially, asking the usual questions about our health in a cordial manner. He took me to a seat at the head of the hall—a sort of double seat with a window behind—-through which armed men kept watch. He placed me on his left, and tea, followed by coffee, was served. We conversed about the general situation, he telling me that Ibn Rashid was now in Madinah with Rakhri Pasha and Ibn Lailah atBamascus with Jamal Pasha. He enquired after news of the dear Government (British) and I was able to tell him that on the day of my arrival at Baghdad (30th September) we had gained a nice victory over the Turks at Ramadi, taking 3,000 odd prisoners and 12 guns. I told him how the Turks were caught and obliged to surrender, the commander being one Ahmad Beg. He told me that all was peace at present on these borders? He gave me a letter from his father, Bin Saud, in which the latter said he was very busy in Riadh at present, but would like to see me there, when it suited my convenience. J My reception was extraordinarily good. I was offered a house in the town or tents outside, choosing the latter as that arrangement pleased them most. They pitched 2 large tents for the men and 1 smaller, but higher, red tent for me. Abbas “ Beg ” conducted me back to my camp after our reception at the Palace' I riding back to camp on Turki’s mare. Our camp was on sand near a clumn of ithal outside the N. E. face of the Buraidah town wall, which is about a mile long with walls about 15 feet high, and a great fort about the centre of the walls with a tower at each corner and one in the centre. A large watch-tower is a conspicuous object in the rear face. Turk! has a thin, pale face of a sort of old ivory colour and smoothness • black eyes, small, but not set too close together; about 5' 8' in height. 1^611^ gent and brave, I should say, and a man fond of honour and with a penchant for higher ideals but somewhat effeminate, with’the inevitable stamp of the favourite son. His face narrow, general expression pleasing, boyish, rather9 &lt;^D tender. He has a look of his father, but is of quite a different build, being light and rather fragile. I asked him about his grand father, Abdur Bahman’s, health and learnt that he was well. 3lst October, Buraidah.—Twc'ki came at about 8-15 a m , accompanied by the Governor of the town, ‘Abdul Aziz bin Jaluwi ( ^ ), and Abbas al Falaji ( ), commonly referred to as Abbas “ Beg ”, fading about 100 horsemen, mostly African slaves. Before coming to the camp they galloped past me as I stood by a tent peg, firb g rifles and revolvers, waving swords, and looking very warlike. I pretended to be duly impressed with this childish fantasia, which was intended as a special honour to me. Afterwards we had a mejlis in a large reception tent which Turld had had pitched for us. Tea, coffee, and biscuits were partaken of and then Turki, with the abovementioned personages, adjourned with me to my private tent to discuss business. Ibn Bashid is at present in Madinah with Fakhri Pasha, while Ibn Lailah is at Damascus with Jamal Pasha. Turki says Ibn Bashid has only about 400 men with him, but can always assemble the Shammar in case of urgent need and it is not possible to take Hail by a coup de main. The two main questions which Iliad to put to lurki were :—(1) why he gave the Shammar caravan a letter to Shaikh Salim for mnsabilah at the end of September, and (2) if it were possible for him to take Hail at this time when Ibn Bashid is obviously so weak. As regards (1) Turki says he only gave the SAammar a slip of paper addressed to all and sundry intended to be for a safe conduct among his tribes lest they should interfere with or attack them. He never meant to give them a pass for musabilah on the way to Kuwait. As for (2) capturing Hail he said that, in the firs* place, it would not be possible to gather his powers rapidly enough to take Ibn B a shid by surprise, and, secondly, he knew that there was one vi lage or suburb) of Hail which was strongly fortified and garrisoned by the Turks. His orders fram his father were to seduce the Shammar and prevent them returning to Ibn Basbid while keeping the Mutair from raiding tribes which had sent quotas to fight under the Sherif. Neither answer is really satisfying. The fact is that an informal truce exists among the tribes of both parties. Bin Sand’s policy is evidently approved of by all. The Bedouin’s one idea at the present moment is to share in the rich harvest of British subsidies and the profits of blockade-running. 1st November .—Bode in early morning to S. W. of city through palm gardens message from him requesting me to stay in camp until the afternoon, when he would himself come and start me on my way. Waited till 4 p.m., when he came out with all his horse, including the Governor, ‘Abdul ‘Aziz bin Jaluwi,- the Arafah (Salman), and another. Was very pleasant and rode with me for -| mile, when he requested leave to return. He said he had just received word from his father sanctioning his return to Biadh as soon as he could be relieved by Fahad ibn Maamar, the former Governor. I am glad I did not meet that were more frank than the Zilfis. Nevertheless, I hear from ; my entourage that they are really inclined to be fanatical, though the palm for fanaticism must now be given to Artawiyah, where all the elect have migrated. Buraidah bazaars are most disappointing. The place struck me as under some evil spell and as most unprogressive, badly built, dirty, and generally uncared for. The inhabit ants have no great love for Bin Sdud or for Hail either. Marched till 8-25 p.m., crossed the Wadi Bummah at about 7-55 p.m., and seemed to be continuously in the vicinity of date gardens till the last 2 miles. Halted on the height overlooking ‘Anaizah. 2nd November .—Descended to lower ground by a stony, but not very steep, Distance, 141 hours, miles.

It appears that I 45 F. &amp; P, D.10 was expected yesterday and that the Amir and principal people had ridden to the outskirts to meet me and stayed there till midday. I apologized, explaining that my detention was due entirely to Turki’s asking me to wait. Had breakfast with ‘Abdullah al Khalid al ‘Abdullah, who succeeded his uncle ‘Abdul ‘Aziz al ‘Abdullah this year. Had coffee and tea at houses of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz al ‘Abdullah, Al-Hamad, Abdur Bahman ibu ‘Abdul ‘Aziz binZamil, all of the Beni Salaim, a most courteous and refined family. They seemed to be men of the world, more enlightened and civilized than any Arabs I have met, and with a charming frankness and independence of manner. They are ideal hosts. ‘Abdullah ibn Idris met me on the way. He had just come from the Sherif’s son, Faisal, at Ak Fak. ‘Aodul ‘Aziz bin Hassun fells me he was present with Shakespear at the fight at Jarab, where he was wounded with a sword on the shoulder and left for dead. He was eventually picked up by some of Bin Sand’s men and carried in 2 days via Artawiyah to Zilfi. When sufficiently recovered, he joined the Sherif who at that time was on the side of the Turks. After the Sherif had cast off the Turks, our friend continued in his service. He spoke a lot about Lawrence with Faisal at Akabah and said he was almost like a Bedouin —all the tribes knew him. Najdis were all called Ao'aili down south and received pay from the Sherif at the rate of £ 6 a month. Those employed on “dynamite” operations for destroying the railway o&gt; 0 t £ 15 per mensem. At least l,00o men, he said, have gone from here to assist the Sherif and about 4,000 from Qasim have gone also to the Eijaz to earn pay. News is that Ibn Baskid left Madinak and went to Al-Hijr. I do not al together agree with the “Handbook of Arabia” regardingits comparison between Buraidah and ‘Anaizak. ‘Anaizahis a handsomely built town. The aristocracy are mostly related and very united. Their corporate life is like that of a medioeval Italian republic, with their elective Amir chosen from the princely house of Bin Salain. Buraidah is larger if the environs and suburbs are taken into account and is, perhaps, more populous. My own belief is that ‘Anaizak has at least an equal settled population and its bazaars are infinitely better in every wuy, the shops larger, better stocked and kept. As for the people there is no comparison ; the people of ‘Anaizah are bv comparison highly civilized^ The best of them have travelled at least to Kuwait, Bahrain Basrah, Karachi, and Bombay, while many of them have gone far afield to the west and are acquainted with Damascus, Beirut, and Constantinople. . Grave all my party 10 dollars each to spend in ‘Anaizah. The Amir invited us all to lunch and dinner. Our Bedouins ate enormously, the food being excellent. The Amir has been very good to us. Feeling in^Anaizah is, I think, strongly for us. After dinner, at 5 r. m., we walked in the bazaars. I saw nothing worth buying, but was again struck with the picturesque and truiv imposing architecture of the palazzos of the great ones, with their adiacent gardens all highly cultivated, the walls being covered with vines and surrounded by fig trees, pomegranates, peaches, etc. Some of the wardens looked as though they would afford delightful retreats in sultry weather. On the whole, Anaizah is a place to rave about when you come in from the desert, it is quite unspoilt by contact with modernism. I should sav there were no paupers; I saw no signs of squalor. The state of civilization of Anaizah shows that the Arab, even when left entirely to himself and almost isolated fiom the world of progress, does not altogether let himself go but retains some ideals and aspirations. He does not become brutalized or insensible to the amenities of life and social intercourse or, generally to the softening influences of comfort and elegance, gome of the rooms of the houses I was shown through were beautiful. One, a coffee-room of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz the retired Amir, was particularly artistic. It was about 18 ft. broad and' 30 t. long. Round the room were open corridors and the room itself had a gallery, with a gnfle under the roof, a sort of promenade for the ladies who come to see and hear what goes on in the coffee-hall below. Some texts from the Quran were artistically painted on the walls on rough moulding in the luminous gloom the effect was very pleasant if bizarre. The utter absence ot symmetry, or line, rather offends the European's eye but these interiors fascinated me and, after all, any attempt at symmetry Would have f 1 Ej.'11 f '4 / * been out of keeping with the general outside and inside designs. I never saw a plumb line outside or inside nor any striving after balancing or matching things. ‘Anaizah is Hke a gem roughly cut by the hands of some barbarian workman ; yet the result is such that one would on no account have the gem recut in modern fashion even were that possible. Abdullah al Hamad came after sunset to bid me good-bye. He is a nice fellow* 3rd November .—Marched at 6-55 a. m. and halted at 10-5 A. M. Sent on ^ „ J . Mutlaq al Naimi (Mutair, sent by TurId) Distance—146 hours, 10 minutes, miles. t along with. Muhammad ion Dahabas, to convey a letter to the Shaikh of Mudhnib, Pahad Agaili, informing him of our intended arrival at the town to-morrow at daylight. Our general direction to-day was S. S. E. over hard ground, stony, with very little vegetation for the most part ; our landmarks, two cliffs on the right of the road, from which it is said to descend direct on to the palms of Al-Mudh nib. Erom our halting-place through a gap on the left of the road to Mudhnib (Itf. E.) saw a depression with palms which are said to be Aziziyah village. Last night ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi, who is continuing along with us to Riadh, said he had high fever and might not be able to start next day. He had, however, recovered sufficiently to travel to-day. We are taking it pretty easy and the weather is delightfully fresh. Started at 2-55 p. M. and pulled up at 4-55 P. m. as we did not wish to reach Mudhnib before morning. We got to within about 2 hours’ distance of Al-Mudhnib and camped in a hollow with sparse arfaj and other grazing shrubs for camels. 4th Started at 3-10 A. m. and got to a place near Mudhnih&gt; marching still over undulating, stony ground ; waited for sunrise and then started to town and met 2 riders sent out by the Amir to meet us. We went to his place and there had tea and coffee. The coffee-hall was a long, darkish room with a large firepit at one end, in which stood 8 or 9 large coffee-pots. As usual, plenty of carpets and a cushioned corner to the right of the hearth looking down the hall. Con versation for about an hour, and then went off to our camp to dress and wash. Some talk about Shakespear, who passed through here in the spring* of 1912 when returning from Riadh. The Amir tells me that Bin Saud makes this a regular halt when passing backwards and forwards to Qasim. The route by the Mistawi is more even going and better for camels as far as grazing is concerned, but this way “ through the villages ”, as they say, is nearer and has the great ad7antage of plenty of water at short stages, and supplies. But if I return I shall go by the Mistawi. One marches better in the desert ; these villages lead to lounging and general carelessness in one’s followers. As for safety there is not much to cboose between the two for a small party. A large party, say of 20 riders, would, however, be absolutely safe by this route and not so by the desert way. Tribes have to be feared on the Mistawi and robbers in Woshm. Mudhnib is more like an Indian village than an Arab one. The soil is all clay and absolutely flat ; there is no trace of sand anywhere. Large standing fields of millet and barley; gardens scattered around. The village is not fortified but has a single qasr. I am told that they have no enemies to fear. Over 100 of the inhabitants have gone to the Hijaz to take service under the Sherif. Distance—153 hours, 383 miles. Temp. 64°, Bar. 3,200'. Eahad ibn ‘Abdul Karim is a charming personality. He is about 40 years of age, has been 25 years Amir of the place, succeeding his father as a lad of 15. He has never travelled. There are 30 houses of Agail, mostly Beni Tamim stock. One fort in town ; villages surround the town to a distance of 2 miles. The population under 3,000. I offered the Amir a present of a smart aba and 70 dollars, but he absolutely refused to take anything, saying that as the faithful servant of Bin Sand he could not do so without the latter’s permission. This is unusual, I think, as both the Amir of Zilfi and Abbas al Balaji accepted the 70 dollars which I gave them. I forgot, perhaps, to mention that the whole party with me, including men from Kuwait £nd12 Muhammareh and from Turki, received 10 dollars each as pocket money to spend in Qasim. The chief peculiarity of Al-Mudhnib is the absolute flatness of the plain on which it is built. Stony cliffs enclose the depression ; its apparent openness to attack on all sides is also a noticeable feature. The inhabitants answered my “ Salaam-Alaikum ” ) smilingly. I observed no surliness, but this is due to the fact that I am passing through the country as the honoured guest of Bin Saud and accompanied by his special messengers, Bami al Bair and Sa’ad Ajmi. The water of this place is salty and aperitive. No one drinks except from one well at Qasr Ibn Saud. That water, which is about 45 ft. below the surface, is really good and sweet ; the best we have drunk since leaving Kuwait. Left at 1-25 in the afternoon, and halted for | hour at Qasr Ibn Saud, which is | hour’s march from the town (about 1| miles). We reached Murabbah (g/*) at 5-10 p. m. 5th November .—Left camp at 5 A. m. and came within sight of Ain as A Suwaimi and halted for breakfast at Temp. 60 ', Bm-. 3 ,no'. 10-10 a.m. All day long passed through good camel pasture, now and then coming on patches of green. The depression appeared to extend about 7 or 10 miles to the west. Passed Qasr al Amar about 9-25 a. m. at a distance of 1^ miles from the road to the west. Kasr al Wuthailan j^) (small ithal bushes) a little further on. Started again at 1 p. m., having sent on Thami and Mirshid to inform the Amir, Dakhilullah, of our arrival before sunset. Leached Ain al Juraifah at about 4-40 p.m. A horseman came out to welcome us. We rode in with him to the village coffee-room, just inside the fort gate, which faces north. This is a compact fortified village with several 2-storied houses and numerous square towers, all new looking and loopholed. There is a palm garden with about 100 palms watered by the springs which flow through it coming along on an underground channel from a distance of about 1| miles S. S. E. of the village. Outside and north of the garden the water fills a ditch with an easy slope in which camels are watered. While here our own camels and those of the Shagrah caravan were watering and splashing about in the fordlike ditch. Had coffee and tea and then went to the Amir’s house and had dates, with milk and ghee. Afterwards visited gardens. Dined with the Amir in his house ; usual boiled mutton and impure water. ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi who had been fasting all day, silly old man, now ate too much. He and I are always placed side by side. 6th November .—Left about sunrise, 6-15 a.m. Marched first through the Distance—169 hours, 26 minutes, miles. Ain es Sirrah depression to foot of Temp. 56°, Bar. 3 , 250 '. Nufudh, which we reached after about 1| hours’ march. First J hour marched S. S. E. along the line of ihe springs. After 3 hours’ marching passed Ain ibn Sakran (water from springs and extensive gardens). Halted at 10-25 A.M. in Nufudh ; very hot. The temperature this morning down to 56°. Heard story of Bin Sand’s treachery towards, and defeat by, the Ajman. Salman al Arafah whom I met at Buraidah was with the ‘Ajman at the time. Bin S&amp;ud had sent 2 men to the ‘Ajman in the afternoon to make a truce till morning, but was overpersuaded by Ibn Jaluwi and his brother. Said, to attack at dusk. Left at 2 in the afternoon and reached hollow in sands at sundown. ‘Abdul ‘Aziz ibn Hassun cheeky ; went to strike my pony for trying to rob dates. Told him to drop it and let pony alone. 8th Abumfor.— Started at 6 a. m„ marched till 9 a. m. Had coffee. Left Nufudh in 20 minutes and then came on hard, black, stony ridge, crossed stony plain till 1-55 p. m., when we re-entered red Nufudh. Good water at 18-ft. well Distance— 177 hours, 50 minutes, miles. called Biras Sali Sent 3 men off to fetch I dozen 'skinfuls of it. Halted at 10-40 a.m. for breakfast. Started at 1-20 p.m., left Nufudh at 1-30 in the after noon, and passed through a stony plain and depression out of which rose ^ dozen detached stonehills of the shape of a round cake. Erom the summit of '•~TTrr-T'«r-.. ' ■••MB fctev t tSr&amp;j/W akhthe plateau above the depression we looked down to Shagralx and Shaijar, which, latter lies about 3 miles north of our road. Shaijar is a larger town than Mudhnib. Beyond Shaijar we saw the ruddy Nufudh and further back the chalklike cliffs of Jabal Tuwaiq. We halted at 5-25 p. m. (sunset), having sent on Thami al Bair and ‘Ali al Dhuwaiki with a letter to the Amir, Muhammad Bin Sand, Al-Lsa. -He has been appointed Amir by Bin Saud. He is a man about 45 jears old. Came to our tents and brought us off to a good breakfast. Was very hot against the ‘Ajman who, he said, were treacherous ; why, he asked, did Ibn Sabah and the British Government harbour them ? Bin Saud, he told us, claims overlordship over Arabia as far as Najran, including Qasim, Hasah, Mekka, Kuwait, and Oman. The Shagrah market is smalb like that of Zilfi, but it is a larger town, surrounded by gardens. It has been well described as a lesser ‘Anaizah. The Amir told us there were 14 large townships in Woshm. Wushaiqir and Shaijar are one and the same ; the name is only a diminutive of Shagrah, of which it is an offshoot. Yesterday had some trouble with‘Abdul ‘Aziz bin Hassun, who tries to thwart me when he can do so safely. I had caught him the previous day twice chasing my pony away vindictively, following him with a stick and swearing. He began to argue till told roughly to let the horse alone. Now he wants to get even and has been giving a lot of trouble in other ways. I had to give him a severe dressing-down. 9th November .—Marched in^o Shagrah at about 7-10 a.m. A horseman Distauce—iso hours, 35 minutes, 469 miles. was sent out to meet us. Breakfast with Temp. 54°, Bar. 3 ,roo'. the Amir. Camped in open north-east of the town in sand. Mullah thinks that Shagrah contains more than 5 to 6 thou sand inhabitants. He says it is about § or f the size of ‘Anaizah and con siders the population to be as high as 15,000. Putting ‘Anaizah at an outside ffgure of 12,000 I should say there might be 8 ,q 00 souls in Shagrah. Had dinner as about 2-40 p. m. with the Amir and then departed, catching up the baggage about f hour later. After leaving Shagrah climbed up the rocky side of the depression and, stopping at the top and looking back with binoculars, had a good view over Shagrah, which lies very low. It is ^ not more than J the size of ‘Anaizah. Has 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants possibly. Bode on to within sight of palms of Tharmidab and halted at sunset, 5-25 p. m., in open patch, putting up some gazelles and a pair of bustard, which Amar tried to stalk; ground hard, country all along Nufudh level, loam plain and covered with fortified granges, looking like castles and called qasrs (castles). 10th Aovemfor.—Started at 7 a. m. and rode straight into Tharmidah, Distance—184 hours, 35 minutes, 484 miles. having sent Thami and Sa’ad on a head to Temp. 68°, Bar. 3 , 335 '. warn the Amir, ‘Abdul Rahman al Angari, who, it seems, formerly resided at Kuwait. His first cousin was the Amir of Tharmidah when it held out against Bin Saud who besieged it. The cousin was put to death for his resistance. Gardens ©f Tharmidah delightful; water in wells 60 ft. below surface. Saw 2 wells, one with 9 and one with 10 buckets, working; each waterskin drawn by bullock, cow, or donkey, with a short, steep run down on both sides. Wells here mostly worked by cattle during hours of day only. Some few wells worked by camels as in Qasim. Plenty of maize and bajra (Dukhan) and dux ; some lime trees, melons, pumpkins, and vegetables grow in profusion; air delightful; people look very much of the cultivating class and are said to be mostly Beni Tamim. Outside walls in ruins. At the Amir, ‘Abdul Rahman’s, house had coffee, tea, and dates and then went and spent an hour or two looking at wells and chatting in gardens with Mullah ‘Abdullah, Amar, and Thami. Thami has had 12 wives; all, except 2, he says, were girls, the other 2 being grown women. He did not keep any of them long. The lad who was with us was the Amir’s servant; very poor; said his only chance of getting a woman was to go on a raid with Bin Saud. Otherwise, he would remain a poor, wifeless wretch to the end of his days. The Amir is a man about 60 years old and a regular type of townbred Arab, most friendly. There seem to be a good many of the Akhwan about here. My “ Salaam-Alaiks ” were not infrequently ignored.14 There has been some hot air in camp ; ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi has been growling against ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin Hassun and the latter and the Mullah are not on good terms. Thami al Bair shouted out the call to prayers and led the crowd but ‘Ali _al Dhuwaihi, who was praying with them, went off hurriedly at the end, saying, in the hearing of all, “ I don’t want any more of this The fact is that Thami is the biggest rip in these parts and he bungled the call to prayers badly. Mirshid went up to him and gave him a lesson ; very funny. And Thami said ‘All right, it did not matter. All the crowd hate and ridicule the Akhwan. I must get a clear account of their tenets. * Last night an interesting conversation with Thami al Bair and Mirshid ; 2 Shammaris who were retainers of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, Shaikh of the Shammar, when they marched victoriously through the towns of Woshm and Sudair. I asked them if Bin Saud could take Hail with guns—Thami said “ Do you want the truth ?—yes; well, every mother’s son of us Shammar would comeback and help to defend Hail—and ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, with all his talk and his thousands of tribesmen, would never get near the place ”. Mirshid said with a laugh “ Last year Bin Sdud had 7,000 men and there were only 1,000 Shammar with Ibn Bashid, hut Bin Saud did not dare to attack Hail and withdrew”. Left Tharmidah in the afternoon at 1-25 and marched along parallel to Nufudh among many fortified farms, some of which look rather dilapidated. Cultivation by rain and wells sunk within the forts. Occupied from December onwards, till harvest is gathered. Camp near Nufudh at sunset, 5-25 p. m. There has been a lot of hot air about in camp lately. We are all a bit travel-weary and irritable. ‘Ali al Dhuwaihi is angry with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz because he won’t give him a riding camel and with me because I only gave him 5 dollars at Buraidah. Mullah ‘Abdullah is very wroth with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, who is far from being popular all round. It was a delightful night and not too cold, 11th AormScr.—Started at 5-25, about | hour before daybreak, and rode „ hard to Bairah, which I reached in under 3 Distance -187 horns 35, minutes, 516 nnles. ■, mi i ,1 xi /• i. hours. The baggage took exactly 6 hours to cover the distance, which I estimated was about 18 miles, not less. This is the best that the baggage have done yet, their usual all-round pace being about 2| miles. When pressed, however, 4 or 4| is not hard for them to do for 2 or 3 hours. Had coffee with the Amir of Barrah and coffee with the ex-Amir, who was disgraced and dismissed for taking the part of Ibn Rashid in the struggle with Bin Saud. All the village came in after coffee. Afterwards ate pancakes and butter; then, after coffee at the ex-Amir’s house, went to camp and had lunch consisting of a cold bustard shot by Amar yesterday with his *303 rifle. A jolly good shot, hitting the bird in the head. The last time I saw the like was last winter on the way to Jaharah when Ahmad al Jabir shot a dove through the neck at 50 yards with a Mauser. Tahad al Dhafiri and Katlan Mutair came to have sore eyes washed. The other Tahad, whose eyes were really bad, got quite well after 2 operations. An inquisitive group of villagers came to ask me if I knew anything about the Sahul. I told thtm all there vas in the “ Handbook of Arabia,” which was more than they themselves had any knowledge of. They were greatly im pressed. Was asked to-day whether it was true that the Daula (the Government, meaning the Ottoman Government) had been beaten out of the field by us— told them we had got hold of Basrah and Baghdad up to Hit. “ Good-good ”, the old man said. The Amir, calling round to my tent to ask me to coffee, suddenly said “ I wished to greet you before but was afraid the Muhammadans might object and, raising my chafiyah, he kissed me on both cheeks—I was utterly taken by surprise and could only say “ God preserve you There are some very remarkable landmarks to be seen from Barrah village. There are cliffs of Jabal Tuvaiq. The bearings from outside the Amir’s house were Attahinah . . . . 300° ( in t). Khashm al Hassan . . 5° Khashra al Tarab . r . . 10° (i .

Temp. 62°, Bar. 4,410'. about 5 miles broad at its mouth. This shciib has a torrent bed with trees on both sides ; it narrows to about 500 yards higher up ; then an ascent of about 200 ft. to watershed and descent into Wad Haisiyah, where I saw the largest trees I have yet come across in Arabia. Some of them attained a height ^ of 25 to 30 ft. We halted at 11 a.m. for 3^ hours and reached our camping place on the Sudus road at sunset, 5-30 p.m. A good talk with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, and think I have straightened him up. No grazing between Barrah and the head of Wadi Hanifah. The Haisiyah Shaib has steep, clifflike sides. I saw only one path across them to the right and one on the left. These were mere sheep tracks impossible for loaded camels. Saw some small partridges in rocks. After crossing the watershed we came on to a long plain, ending in the head of Wadi Hanifah. Here, too, begin the extensive and imposing ruins of Al-Aiyainah ( ). This old town was about 2f miles long. The torrent banks are revetted with stone masonry, without mortar, roughly dressed. Many wells, much like those of to-day but with no water in them. At Al-Jubailah ( ) is a mud village among the ruins of the old town but the onty inhabitant appeared to be an old negro who has a house and a patch of cultivation there. He looks after travellers and is, I think, a guard of Bin Sand’s. 12th November tarted at 6-15 a.m. and halted at 11 a.m. by some trees at the ruined village of Al-Jubailah Distance 204 hours, 20 minutes, miles. ^ There WaS one ^ Well above this ; here there are two, one of which is at the foot of the ruined village. The water at Al-Aiyainah (one well), is at a depth of 96 ft., at Al-Jubailah 84 ft., at Daraiyah 72 ft., at Riadh 84 ft, and at Barrah about 48 ft. The negro told me that ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin Saud and his escort rode here in 12| hours from Riadh 2 months ago. The cemetery at Al-Jubailah is very extraordinary ; the graves are exposed on the side of the Wadi by diluvion action. These graves are said to be those of the companions or of the followers of Khalid ibn Walid and other worthies of early Muhammadan times. Plenty of wood-cutters with their camels on the Wadi of Hanifah ; each camelload fetches in Riadh 1^ or 2 dollars. To-day I rode more or less all the time with the baggage, but yesterday afternoon went off with Sa’ad (‘Ajman) Amar, the Mullah, and Pahad Dhafiri. We set up a target, after some private camel-racing in which my camel, usually by far the fleetest, did not distinguish herself greatly. She is a bit tired out I think. The baggage thought we were being attacked and sent on all their riders to help us. Nights very windless ; the days much the same. Only two or three cloudy nights since we left and never one with wind ; always slept in the open. ‘Abdul ‘Aziz bin Hassun complained. This led to a big row (‘Abdul ‘Aziz’s last fight for independence—since then he has been a lamb). Continued march down Wadi Hanifah. The wadi, as it is familiarly called in these parts, is said to rise behind the village of Awainib and Al- Garadan {see 11th November, page 14, ante), a scarp which stands out very promi nently almost due south of Barrah village ( ). Awainib is the fortified village which we passed on our right about 2 miles out from Barrah. I could not, make out exactly where Haisiyah ends and where Hanifah begins, but I think it is somewhere in the vicinity of Aiyainah to the north-west of the ruins. Reached Baraiyah about | hour before sunset with | dozen riders and found plenty of lucerne and wood, also, later, some milk and eggs collected by Sand and Ibn Dahibas, who had been sent on ahead. Met a lad about 12 years of age of the As-Saud family who came down to our camp-fire on the wadi bed to chat with us. His name is Hadhlul ( jy^ ) ^and he belongs to the Al- Jaluwi branch. 13th November. —Started at 6-5 A. m. and reached the outskirts of Riadh at 8-45 a. m. We were met 2 miles out of Distance 207 hours, 583 miles. j, ^ at a ± tree by &lt;Abdul ‘Aziz fflu Temp. 58°, Bar. 3190 '. Rabayi and 5 horsemen who gave us the16 usual exihibition of horsemanship but without letting off rifles. One of them fell off. 'Reached Riadh; met at Palace gates and conducted to mejlis wher e all the principal Shaikhs assembled. Sat on right of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin Saud. The whole length of the top wall was unoccupied except by two of us ; then Muhammad ibn Abdur Rahman, ‘Abdul ‘Aziz's brother, an extremely influential man in Najd, Paisal ibn Rashid (refugee from Hail), Mullah‘Abdullah, my reader, Salih al Adil, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad bin Saif (of Kuwait), ‘Abdullah Bin Saud, brother of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, and 5 or 6 of the Araif were among the principal notables present. Afterwards went for a private talk in the maktab, or office, of Bin Saud. Then breakfast. At 2 p.m. visited ‘Abdur Rahman Bin Saud, the Imam, as he is generally called, an old man with saffron-coloured beard, about 70 years of age, a charming personage. We were conducted to a bright reception-room, with lofty roof, 3 central pillars and doors at both ends but in opposite corners of the rectangle ; triangular windows high up on walls let in plenty of light ; good carpets and cushions round walls. Long conversation, chiefly on general politics. ‘Abdur Rahman is yellow in face, with the dark, clear, inscrutable eyes of the true and wise, resembling remarkably those of Lord Roberts. He is as strongly pro-British now as he was when Raunkiaer met him before the war in 1912. The latter remarked of him :—“ On the last subject, the relative power of European States, especially in the matter of Africo-Asiatic politics, I could do no more than confirm the chieftain’s deep-rooted belief in the hegemony of the British Empire” Most charming and affable to myself ; Mullah ‘Abdullah and all my follow* ing who accompanied me have been saying what a fine old man the Imam is. Back to Palace, past the keep, which was taken by ‘Abdul ‘Aziz and his 45 faithful companions in 1910. Saw bullet marks in frame of huge door. There were 70 defenders but these surrendered after 20 of them had been killed and wounded. Long talk with the Amir in his private room; served with tea by a pretty boy. In came ‘Abdullah al Hakim, a young “ medical ” of Mosul, who had got his degree in Constantinople. Handsome, French-looking, about 30. Speaks French fairly well. Also came Ahmad ibn Thanaiyan of the As-S£ud family. Old-looking young man with “ tender eyes ”, as the Bible hath it, understands French very well, was born in Constantinople. The Amir suspicious about me ; wants to know if I come to find out all about him and to criticize him .:—“ What do we want,of him &gt; He has carried out all he promised, which was to neutralize Ibn Rashid. But for his (B. S.) menace, the Sherif would not have been in a position ever to rebel against the Turks ; Ibn Rashid would have put a stopper on any movement of his in that direction. So the fact that the Sherif has been able to keep the field so long against the Turks (even if his early success had been possible otherwise) is due to Bin Sdud’s neutralizing the power of Ibn Rashid. Yet Bin S&amp;ud’s action is not given proper credit by us. He has to hear himself traduced, people even saying that he is secretly helping Ibn Rashid to hold out against us—because he is supposed to be jealous of the Sherif. If he were so, which is not the truth, there would be some reason for his jealousy. The Sherif has secured a great position, he has got hold of the Harb and Ataibah tribes which belong to Bin Saud and also some thousands of Qasimi—or Agailis as they are called—all subject to Bin Saud. Have we not poured gold into the Hijaz ? Here on this side everything has got dear- Riyals had appreciated (the relative value to the sovereign being 5} dollars in ‘ Anaizah and 6± in Riadh). Camels aie dear and clothes too. Rice is now far more expensive than before the war. The Turks in Madinah and Syria are getting supplies through the Shammar and ‘Anaizah, who have come in to us, and so on, and so on”. Bin Sand’s complaints are numerous. Money and supplies would, doubtless* put a fresh complexion pn matters. We spoke about Ibn Rashid and the possibility of knocking him out. At first Bin Saud said it was an impossible task. “Ibn Rashid was a Shaikh of a single, powerful tribe which would unite at once for self-defence in case of Hail being attacked. He (Bin Saud) could, of course, call on his tribes-the Mutair, Ahl-Murrah, Dawasir, Subai Ataibah, Harb, Beni, Hajar, Beni Khalid, Dhafir, ‘Anaizah, etc. All of them would gather at the bidding and would be a large mob, difficult to control or18 \ Bin Sand is certain. Nor can lie be brought over to our side because it is the fundamental policy of Hail and the Shammar to lean on the Turks so as to remain independent of Najd. 15th Attended mejlis in Bin Sdud’s office. Sat next to Faisal ibn Rashid, the fugitive; beyond DayiigM-Toms.ior. him was Ibn Farun ( ^&gt;1 ) [Abu Hamdi ) as he is called ]; and his nephew, Musa ( ); another nephew, Sabri ( ), is also in Riadh. Sabri has a fair beard and is very German-looking. Ibn Farun is a small, fat man of about 40, with a limp. Musa is tall and dark. Ibn Farun used to be a great friend of Bin Sand’s. The latter now keeps him as a prisoner, but allows him some liberty. Many people say that the old friendship between them still continues, sub rosa, and the confinement of Ibn Farun is a mere pretence. The Amir was not keen on my seeing him in my rooms. Had a long talk with ‘Abdullah al Hakim and Ahmad ibn Thaniayan. At 2-30 p. m. went for a ride with Bin S£ud and most of the As-Saud family, including half a dozen little boys. Bin Saud led a sort of war-dance on horseback and, after galloping round for about half an hour, we went and sat under a mud wall in the sun while the horses were off- saddled and allowed to roll in the sand. Bin Saud fired 2 shots with a revolver and 10 with a rifle without hitting the mark, except once. A stone was stuck up at a distance of 150 yards. We then came back to the town in procession. After dinner, at 8 p. m., went to the Amir as usual and heard a torrent of talk, mostly against Salim (Shaikh of Kuwait), till 10-30 P. M., when we retired. Bin Saud seems worried and never gets easily carried away by the exuberance -Mejlis at 8-30 this morning. Found the Amir alone. of his word-flow. 16th November.- Letters brought from Hasah; Bin Saud very depressed about Italian re verses; description of situation by Reuter as capable of resulting in a Rumanian debacle has given him a fright. Our success at Bir-Sheba did not make up for it. After breakfast Ahmad ibn Thanaiyan came and discussed politics. Went for gallop round Biadh—which is a small place—rode out to village of Manfuhah—riverbed of Wadi Hanifah—is very rocky here. Returned to supper, which I still continue to eat with my Bedouin companions. Must discuss camp for mission. Riadh cannot be larger than Shagrah though they say that it is. 17th November. —Had a little fever last night; am sweating it out to-day, ^ ^ ptqo t&gt; q 1 jr/v Went for a ride on camel at 1-45 (Arabic); Early morning —Temp. 73°, Bar. 2,150. , v .j . &lt; * returned in time to attend meghs at 3-10 (Arabic). Met the Amir ; several other members of the As-Saud family present, also Ibn Farun and his nephew, Musa, and Faisal ibn Rashid. After breakfast came ‘ Abdullah al Hakim and endeavoured to persuade me to put my ideas of what Bin Sdud should do on paper. I said that I must wait for the arrival of these two officers from Hasah and see any instructions they might be bringing with them, but that opr preliminary conversations had been of great valup. I had quite a good general notion of what the Amir’s ideas were and what he was able to attempt. The capture of Hail is the first, in fact, the only, problem v e have at present to face. The fall of Hail would mean, in all probability, the collapse of Madipah. Bin Sdud’s main idea is his position in Central Arabia (now and after the war). The question now was a twofold one:—“Was he to maintain his present attitude and carry out his part of the bargain made at Kuwait in November 1916 {vide page 11 of precis regarding the relations of the British Government with Bin Saud), i.e., maintain a force in Qasim of 4,000 men to hold Ibn Rashid in check and attack him, if opportunity occurred, or to take a more active line ? In either case his finances must be bolstered up, but, in the latter case, he would require munitions and money far in excess of his present allowances and on par with the subsidies granted to the Sherif. In fact, we should regard and equip him as a British Division, It is obvious that taking a more active part means attacking the Shammar and endeavouring to capture Hail. It would be suicidal to make the attempt without adequate means in money, supplies, armed forces, and war material “ There cannot be ”, he went on saying, ** the least doubt that but for his atti tude and for his keeping in check not only his own tribes, but those of Ibn Rashid alone made it possible for the Sherif to act with any freedom against the Turks now ”.\ 19 \ Bin S&amp;ud is not in the least avaricious; in fact, his fault lies in the other direction, i.e., in excess of generosity. But he must have more money to hold his tribes together. Turki at Buraidah had altogether run out of provisions, such as rice, etc., and that was one reason why he had to leave and come away to Riadh. The monthly cost of upkeep of 4,000 men at Buraidah would not be less than $56,000, or £9, 400 at the rate of $14 per man per month—$6=£1 (the rate in * Anaizah was $5f—£1). I myself think that £10,000 per mensem and another 3,000 rifles, with ammunition and some light guns, would be sufficient to maintain the present somewhat inactive plan. The cost of large operations would have to he worked out by some other method. The Sherif’s men are paid £6 per mensem, or $36 per mensem. Bin Saud would prefer the system of tribal allowances. If major operations are undertaken who are the enemy and what is their strength ? They are Shammar and Ajman. The Ajman would have to be eliminated first, either by our making a special arrangement with them (e g., to give hostages from every main clan to remain peacefully in Zubair and Kuwait) or by attacking them all round and then taking on the Shammar. Any attack upon Hail would bring all sections together to defend the place. They are a strong tribe. Moreover, they have the Turks close to their back door. In the evening again spent a couple of hours talking to Bin Saud. 17th November .—At 8 a.m. rode out with Bin Sdud to meet Turki. He and his cavalry charged, passed on to the Wadi bed, firing their rifles and pistols and shooting as they passed Bin Saud, who sat on the rim of a w r ell in the shadow of a wall. This gallop past was repeated three times and then there were greetings and kissings and general rejoinings. After that I returned to town. Had an interview at 8 p.m. as usual with Bin Sdud; discussed tribal matters. Talking about our policy with the Arabs, or for that matter the policy of any outside Power, we should, he hinted, be making a great mistake if we imagined we could mould such unstable material to our will. He compared Arabs to their country ; every now and then there was a great flood {seyl) which swept every thing away—buildings, gardens, and homes—down the wadi. He likes to think that the Sherif’s power is very temporary, built on our largesse only. As soon as the money fails the tribes will return to their old allegiance and look to Najd as the fountain of liberty, secular and religious. Hence his interest in the Wahabi revivalist movement called the Ikhwan. His religious leadership will, he hopes, in the long run carry him on some such wave to the Empire of Arabia—the dream of all the Bin Sauds. 18th November .—Rode in the ISarly morning —Temp. 75°, Bar. 2,725'. morning as usual on camel with Mullah* Mirshid, and Amar. Did some photo graphy afterwards. In the afternoon c Abdullah, the ductor, came to talk. Said he had been in Turkish service through the Balkan war ; afterwards deserted out of hatred for the Turks and their despiteful treatment of Arabs in all ranks of life. He fled first to Greece, then to Egypt (6 months), India, and finally to Basrah, where he lived for some time before the outbreak of the war. He was, he said, with Talib Beg at Muhammareh when the latter was negotiating with our representatives there. Now lives at Hasah. Attended big dinner given by Bin Saud to all Shaikhs and people in honour of Turki’s safe return from Qasim. Did not ride in the afternoon. 19th November, Riadh .—Rode our camels to Manfuhah : did some photo* t &gt; /.qo t&gt; „ KOK / graphy. Gardens lovely at Riadh. Had Temp. (F, es-. b,,. W 36.

Returned in the afternoon. 22nd November. —Went to office of Bin Saud. Dr. ‘ Abdullah came to see me. In afternoon went for ride with Bin Saud and his family to Shamisiyah; returned at sundown. At 8 p.m. again went for 1 hour’s chat with Bin Saud. He explained that his trouble_with Ihn Subah (Kuwait) was not really connected with the question of taxation of the Awazim, for, though he did claim the latter as his subjects really, he was content to leave them to- Ibn Suhah ; the quarrel was really about the ‘ Ajman. After their going off, contrary to their agreement, and joining with the Shammar to oppose him last winter and spring he could not remain on any sort of terms with them. It was unfriendly of Ibn Subah to harbour them now. He would not hear of any further pardon. It was useless, as we knew, because their Shaikhs were unrepentant. Dhaidan especially was a Turk of the Turks. Either they must surrender some of their chief Shaikhs and go off to help the Ataibah and Harb in Qasim or they should be told to go off to the ‘Anaizah country and help Ibn Hadhdhal. Long discussion on world-politics followed before the last drink of lebcm of camel’s milk was brought—Bin Sand's signal for bed. 24th November. —Rode in morning to Manfuhah. Some photography. Ibn Thanaiyah came to discuss politics. Rode in morning with Fahad, Amar, and Muhammad ; after breakfast went to coffee with the men in their two houses in town ; looked for curios in Suq. Rode in the S. and W. of the town with Ibn Rabayi; discussed the ‘A jman. Long conversation with the Amir chiefly regard ing tne ‘ Ajman and Ahl-Murrah. Says the ‘Ajman out against him could not possibly muster more than 1,500 men. The Ahl-Murrah are now well armed. 25th November. —Still no news of Philby and Ounliffe-Owen. Attended mejhs this morning ; religious discussion. The Amir again hell forth on heresies and infidelity of Turks. There seems to be a general assent to these sentiments.

The qasr is a ruined torver, and round it are some signs of cultivation. Left again at 10-15 after watering; general direction N, W. More northerly than yesterday. Plenty of sheep and some catt and camels. Also saw many sandgrouse. The cultivators are men of Eiadh. There is a pink sandhill at foot of Al-Arumah ( ) called The range of Al-Arumah trends towards Wadi which it heads off beyond Manfuhah. At 11-45 a.m. hill (about 120 ft. above on right of road) from which good view of Al-Arumah is obtainable. Eoad rocky, latterly with black patches. Al-Arumah is the same colour as Tuwaiq, viz., greyish clay. The sandhills, or Nufudh, below are pink. The water of Shaib Banban flows from west to east til] it strikes the Nufudh which runs about N. W. and S. E. Thence its flow is S. S. E. They say the water of this shaib does not join the W adi Hanifah but disappears in the sand. A conspicuous object, pink sandhill, during the latter part of our march wras bearing about 345* called “ Nigah al Mutawah, Faraj Banban ” ( ). We halted at 2-30 p.m. about 1| miles short of this orange-coloured, pyramidal sandhill, the Mutawah ( ).

At about 10-45 a.m. we got clear of the sandbank, called Araij al Banban, and crossed an open plain going thence due north towards the Al-Arumah range, making for a gap in the hills which we reached at 1-45 p.m. Here on the right the cliffs are broken down as if by heavy artillery. This is called khanasar (little fingers) (^0^1 ). The whole range of Al-Arumah is extraodinarily like a fort on a hill, such as Chiborgarh and others like it in India. or shaibs Khanasir when 1 took the right, Between 2-45 p.m. and 3-5 p.m. we crossed three watercourses, as they are called, viz., Al-Ruaighib ( ), Silah ( ), and ). At 3-45 we reached the highest point on the pass the barometric reading (3,400 ft.). There were higher domes on perhaps 400 ft. above the road. The valley narrowed now and we came on to a watercourse where we camped at 4-45 p.m. having marched 7 hours on end *. 9th December .—Started at 6-45 a.m. At 7-25 a.m. came in sight of valley of Al-Ats ( ). At 7-45 a.m. entered valley which cuts the Al-Arumah range in 2 and is here about 4 miles broad. Our march was over red sand in a northerly direction, the ground falling away slightly to the east. The wells are due N. E. from this point on the edge of the Ats valley. Many Arabs about, mostly Subai and Sahul. Valley of Ats runs W. S. W. and E. N. E. Splendid grazing, sandy. At 12-25 p.m. began to re-enter range of Al-Arumah from Ats, which here takes a bend to the north, we keeping our direction of 10° East of North. Half an hour later on our left hand are two hills somewhat like a woman’s breasts called Khanadar.

Bed of Ats is here black with the trodden dung of ages; water is drawn by camels pulling a rope. Many women seem to be employed on this job. They look curious riding draught camels among the men. At the near well 5 camels were drawing at the same time. Shot some sandgrouse. Hafar al Ats is at least 3 hours south of the nearest Dahanah belt and not as shown on the map in the Dahanah. 10th December.— JjQit Hafar al Ats at 7 a.m. Lovely pink dawn, though cloudy morning. A few drops of rain had fallen in the night. Got a heavy cold and fever. Thousands of camels were marching out from wells, where they had been watering overnight. There came in strings of sheep and camels from opposite directions to take their places. Some Shammar shepherds on their way to Bin Saud came into camp last night and went on their way to Riadh this morning. They belonged to the Aslam, a section of Ibn Khudhaiyim from Barazi’s lot. There was a boy with them called Muisnid ibn Khudhaiyim, about 14 years old, very pleasing in appearance. Our direction at starting was 10 ° West of North.

I think this is a better road than that via Al-Gara’a and Gaiyiyah by which we went to Buraidah in October.

Sand ridges very steep on north side, but, generally speaking, the marches are easier m gradient than further west and firmer and more covered with vegetation, especially with nussi ™ which is wonderful here.

The Jaham is the broadest of all the 7 ridges. Such wonderful grazing, camel shrubs, and nussi grass I have never seen anywhere ^ as this afternoon; indeed, these last 3 days we have passed a wonderful grazing country. The northern slopes of the Dahanah ridges are far steeper than the southern. Had dinner in my tent with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz bin Hassun, ‘Abdullah, Mirshid, and Amar to eat the bustard and hare. Most cheery dinner, with plum-pudding, joint, tea, and biscuits to follow the great meat dishes. Tobacco is much in demand in this bleak weather. Eahad al Dhafiri is a great joke.

However, after marching on for about another hour we came suddenly on the hill overlooking the wells. Decided to stop short of the wells as we are wet and uncomfortable and want fuel more than water. There is never fuel nor grazing in the vicinity of important wells. Camped at 12-15 p.m. Have still got the ‘Ajman ladies marching in our wake ; one is an aunt and the others connections of Shaikh Dhaidan ibn Hithlain. I send them food for which they are grateful and daily send thanks. They ride, two of them, in howdahs on thelnls, and the third astride. Incredible story brought me hy Dabbi to-day that on the day that Ibn Dabayi left us with ‘Abdullah Shammari to go to Biadh he learnt that there were 9 German askar (soldiers) at Riadh. Afterwards, when we had reached Shagrah from ‘Anaizah, the 9 Germans passed us along another route to Hail. In Riadh he learnt that they had come by ship from the Hijaz. He said that Bin Saud wanted only to make himself strong and was taking all he could from both sides. He meant to make Ibn Sabah (Kuwait) acknowledge his supremacy and to attack him if he would not comply. Meanwhile, the Kuwait standard is at Gara’a, 2 days this side nf Subaihiyah. Dabbi believes that the Subai are out raiding against Kuwait. Of course, Bin Saud’s policy is self-centred. He, possibly, thinks that the Central Powers will get the upper hand, at least in Asia Minor. He wishes to consolidate his power over all the Arab tribes of Najd, Hijaz, and East Syria. Dreams of the restoration ©f the ephemeral Wahabi Empire of former days undoubtedly are the main spring of his policy * That is why he is fostering the Ikhwan revival at Artawiyah. The Ikhwan are receiving daily accessions. When at Ri,adh it was the Ataibah ; now I hear that the majority of the Mutair and some Shammar has been converted. This is a militant Wahabi revival ; they consider any intercourse with Christians to be pollution, while the rather loose Muhammadans of Kuwait are treated as misbelievers. Therefore, the Ikhwan are hated in Kuwait, Old Paris al Amaid of the Mutair, however, sai,d that he had not gone over. He, for instance, did not believe in them ; he was not going to lie he said. Bin Sand thinks that the Ikhwan will make a splendid fighting nucleus. They are real fanatics. My reader, ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abdulillah, a very devout Muhammadan who always leads prayers in my camp, and is regarded as a learned Mullah, says that the Ikhwan are ignorant and ill-conditioned. According to him the worst thing about them is their intolerance of their co-religionists, whom they call Kafirs (Yakafarum ghai Musalmin). My experience of the Arabs here and elsewhere in Mesopotamia is that they regard us as softies. England to them is a sort of fairy godmother rolling in wealth, kindly, and silly. This attitude does us no harm, no more than the prosperous man’s patronizing of the Almighty harms the latter or deflects him a hairsbreadth from his inexorable designs. As a policy in contrast to that of German frightfulness British softness and apparent blindness has paid us well. We have roped in the whole world thereby while Germany has only secured Bulgaria. Still going over this uninteresting Summan steppe, following what is apparently, a long valley, but is actually a succession of such valleys the longer axes of wTiich run N. and S. and thus facilitate our way, forming in fact, a sort of sunken road ; innumerable paths lead off on both sides. Have sometimes left road for a few miles and everywhere found a network of such paths, any one of which, if followed, takes the general direction of the main road. Ine mam road is called makatti ( ), or the cutting. Many Salubis about but no other Arabs come this way at this time of year.

These 2 wells contain good water at a depth of 25 ba, or 150 ft-, i.e., the same as Al-Gara’a to the N. W., which we passed on our march to Buraidah. Got off at about 11-35 a.m., but went to the wells to water the horses and sheep, of which 10 only remain of the flock of 20 presented to us by ‘Abdul ‘Aziz (Bin Saud). Halted at 2-15 p.m. by another solitary sugar-loaf hill rising out of the broad depression. Direction due north, marching in teeth of shimal (north wind), with fine, cutting rain. Obliged to dismount from camel and was so stiff could hardly walk. Walked last couple of miles into camp. Usual dreary Summan scenery but valleys more open than on Kuwait-Zilfi route. Vegetation poor (no nussi), light yellow sand. The sand on the Summan is different altogether from that on the Nufudh, which is extremely fine and pinkish in colour (in the distance orange). Thunder in west. The Arabs say about it that it means a seyl, or flood, at a distance of 2 days. In the summer lightning like that is only 1 or 5 hours distant. Mahsin, the Imam’s man, told me to-day, apropos of my having fever, that Bin Sand was a great doctor. I said “ How did he heal ?” He said “ By siyasah ; but it was a wonderful thing Am feeling travel-weary ; hence the fever I think.

They were a nice pair and '•'•ere riding beautiful ponies, a grey and a chestnut about 14.2 hands. I made a remark about these animals afterwards to Bahainara, our SH.OTAJ hafeek and he told me that Ibn Rashid had got their dam,a famous mare and was keeping here at his stud in Hail.

While receiving therrij i the Shagra caravan Began to arrive under its ameer, ABdullah Bin Sadhan. He says that he met a very large Shammar caravan coming from Nejd under IBn JaBrin or Belonging to that section of the Shammar. He thinks that they have in all proBaBility Been sent By Turki as their people are camped Beyond Artawiyah* Hear at every place that IBn Rashid is now in Teimah; also that he is now deserted By most of the Shammar. The latter can get nothing from the KerBela,Hej ef, Shmawah line and are very hard put to it for food. All the Shammar say that they wish to take sides with us or, to put it in their own words, to come under the Government, Mv experience of the AraBs of tne ohaniyah (i.e. desert south of the Euphrates) during the last tv/o years, or so, all goes to show; that their friendliness to the British is genuine. I think the Bedouin are traditionally pro-British. We have a great name among them for humanity,justice and honesty. J -hey alw f ays say that the English man is a man of his word.

We had one or two very unreliable Shammar Hafeeks (friends) with us and |ie If ear ed further visits and demands from Barazi and his tribe who* are now camped at the al-Asafa. The Shagra caravan was a bit worn out and would prob .bly need a day’s rest. I agreed. I think our Shammar Rafeek Bin Dhhaiman is a suspicious character, having caught him several times whis pering or talking apart with the Barazi brothers. His joining us also was very old. H e came to us on our first march and asked what arrangements we had made for him. We said we knew' nothing about him and told him to go to the Shaikh. lie has never been satisfied since his arrival. Agreed with Abdulaziz to shake him off on the first opportunity. Fahad al Dhafiri is an old man sent with me by the Shaikh. He is reliable,I think,and most cheery, always singing out the quaint phrase 'Shughal Taiyar”, which he says he picked up from Colonel Knox, v/hen the latter was Political Agent here. We have some Salubbis with us. Many things about them and most of all their regular feature? differentiate them from the Arabs. They may well be a remant of one of the Crusaders,as they themselves claim. Salib means cross and the word Salubi can be easily understood to signify Crusader. They are greatly despised by the Arabs but have many privileges and can go every where without fear of bei$g plundered. The Kuwait missionaries told me that the cross figures in their marriage ceremonies as one of the emblems or symbols used in the rites. Our Arabs would not water the S-alubbas* camels till I went to the well myself and persuaded them to do so.I -7- Heard from Barazi that the Turks have agent out 'buying camels from, the Shammar and have al ready secured a large number.

Water appears to flow north. Still cloudy. South breeze; very cool. The Shagra caravan in 3 large squadrons followed us at about 3 miles distance. Khathayar,the six-foot Zanzibar negro servant sent to look after me by the Shaikh of Mohammerah, had a swelling on his thumb. Had to operate with a penknife; filled up with boracic and bandaged. After the pus came out Khathyar had instant relief; hope he gets all right again soon. Last night he slept beside me, suspecting treachery on part of some Shammar guests of ours. This marching with a caravan is tiring,but it seems advisable in view of our untrustworthy Shammar Rafeeks, to stick to them till we reach the real ’’d irah ” of the Mtair. Mohamed ibn Dahabas with my compliments to the Ameer of the caravan to enquire when he intended to halt. His reply which was polite and florid amounted to this that his camels were a rotten lot and in bad condition and that he intended halting at the first place where camel grazing was to be had. So I sent Mirahed o nto look for a camp. He found a charming little hollow, with plenty of grass (Nussi) for the horse.

We seem to be moving through a succession amphitheatres which have no apparent exits; mostly circular with a diameter of one to two miles. Crossing from one to another is rough going for camels. 1 wonder that their feet stand it and don*t believe any but the locally-bred baasts could. Managed to shake off the Shammar crowd, which is bodnd for Artawiyah and joined up with us yesterday. But I shall have to leave the caravan again; they are too painfully slow, 73 //* 3o Dist. 21st . Started at 3.2b a.m, and chose nice little miles, hollow with grazing at about 9-2b a.m. We ate Bar. 2680’. dried gazelle of which we had bought 27 car casses from the Solubbis at al Gara’a. We paid 2 dollars per carcass. Lately there was a lot of unnecessary talk about the march,and conti nuing with or leaving the caravan,the proper time to start or to halt,everyone having his own and a difficult idea on these points. Deter mined, therefore, totake charge myself and have no more argument or advice. Sooner or later every traveller is compelled to do the same, of travel in Arabia; however slight may be his expereince/ otherwise there are disputes from which all sorts of little troubles arise. The result of my taking charge as caravan leader has so far been satisfactory. We had a good 3 or 4 hours march before daylight and the camels came on gaily all the way. Aarched from 2.15 p.m. to 8.45 p.rn. ; met small rrfj±£«k» body of Shammars,taking goods to Artawiyah.

People are said to hear the echo of the call to prayer by a ghostly Mtawa there at dawn. Plies so bad that it is almost impossible to write.

At 5.30 a.m. just before daylight sent Ghanaim and Ibn Dahaiman o n to the wells Gayiyah. We followed and got there about 9.15 a.m. Our caravan very tired after yesterday’s ploughing through the sand ridges that constitute the Dahana. The guides made Gayiyah instead of Dujani as had been our intention. We found plenty of sheep. There are 20 wells,the water is cool and sweet quite the best we have had since Sirrah.

Marched at 5.45 before sunrise and reached descent into the deep stony gorge, which forms the entrance into Zilfi from this direction, at about 8.55 a.m. The baggage camels came very slowly. This steep place is called Attawaij ( A ). We waited for the camels for an hour at the first well, '^here was a small garden attached to the well and a square cover exactly over it. The well was cut into the solid rock the water being about 18 feet below the surface when we saw it, which was after many sheep had been watered. It was not more than 2 or 3 miles from Zilfi but w*e did not get to our camp between the tvp towns until 11.45 a.m. i. e, our progress v/as latterly at the rate of about a mile an hour. At 2.15 in the afternoon, the Ameer of Zilfi by name Osman Ibn Mohammad, who lives in the Western town came to call. e had sent on two riders to inform him of our arrival from, the first well (Mirshid and Abdullah-al-Dahabas rent on). Osman is an old man, very gentle and polite in manner. He has invited us all to dinner. We halt tomorrow/ when I hope to see the two tow/ns. The new town which replaces that destroyed by Ibn Rashid some years back is a quadrangle facing North with 5 towers connected by a curtain the height of which is about 15 feet. The east and West sides have 3 square towers in addition to the circular towers connecting them with North and South faces. We camped at a aistance of about 700 yards from the East face of the new^ town. The old town is about if miles from the new one. The Ameer has promised to take me over the old town tomorrow. There is a suburb lying very slightly West of North, about 3 miles from Zilfi, called Araiarah ( ) ). At 4.45 p.m. had coffee — fc*' ‘SiM, I'iiini. 4 •-, tfatiiitai Day light . o T emp .56 .

During coffee conversation turned on the question of passes. The Ameer was understood to say that passes given By him had not Been accepted at Kuwait. We explained that the reason was proBaBly that his name had not Been given us By Bin Baud as one of the Ameers qualified to grant passes in his name. Many of the principal merchants of Kuwait, he tells me, a,re from Kasim families who have migrated thither in recent generations. It seems that all the aristocracy of Kuwait, as well as the places like ZuBair and Khamisyah are Nejdis New Zilfi is called Alajdah ( ). and old Zilfi Al-Balad. ( ). 26th QctoBer . halted. Visited old Zilfi with Ameer and spent a couple of hours shopping there with Mullah ABdullah to assist me. People cool But not unfriendly. There are here,as everywhere a few of the Akhwan sour faced fellows w/ho hate the jovial people of Kowait almost more than they do the infidel. Had coffee in the afternoon with Ali-al-Dhowaihiknd a long chat with him. The gardens in the rocky clefts, each wihh its pro- tectitu^, tower and couple of armed men standing on guard, are the most distinctive feature of Zilfi. 27th.0ctoBer . Halted.

The upkeep of this well and garden w/orked out at 100 dollars a month, so rny host informed me. The local opinion of the present political situation in that Bin Baud and iBn Bashid have some sort of understanding though Bin Baud and the Mtair are on their guard against the Ajman, who would have i; 1 ,:.u y-&lt;r:V have left completely in the lurch had not balim given them an asylum in his territories. This under standing is Relieved to he in the nature of a truce. Bin Baud may think that the Central Powers will he the eventual victors. He does not relish the idea of being driven out of Hassa should the Turks return, hut on the other hand he believes that if we are victorious it will not he long before we take control of all the Arab littoral of the Gulf including Hassa. If the Entente powers succeed, Bin Baud will have to take a hack seat as regards H.H. the King of the Hejaz and this would be a more bitter pill for him than even the loss of Hassa. He is there fore sticking his toes into the ground,jealousy of the Shereef, jealousy of Kuwait, and religious and racial jealousy of our conquest of Mesopo tamia are causing him to veer round. There is a revivalist Islam movement in Riyadh and Artawiyah, How r far Bin Baud and his father are countenancing it, can only be guessed at, but he might find in it the weapon that he is locking for to get even with the Shereef. Bin Baud's hostility towards Shaikh Salim, of Kuwait for harbouring the Ajman is a factor not to be lost sight of, quite possibly Kuwait, which is the lever of Kasim will prove an in valuable counter weight to any hostile combinati tion in Nejd. If Bin Baud should throw us over, Kuwait could bring us into relations with ShamMa mar and Ajman and enable us to use them lor our purposes. Bin Baud complains that we haibour the Ajman his enemi es, whilst he, faithful to the letter and spirit of his agreement with us,will have nothing to do with our enemies. This is probably the line he will take withps, He7u.. Dist. hours. miles. Bar.3380* }U -if. We should get him to take Hayil if he wants an increase of allowances. The above reflections are the result of my talks with the Zilfi Ameer a man of great independance of character,who talks unusually freely about local politics, 28th. October. Started at 7.15 a.m. reached the Nefudh in 20 minutes. About hours from Zilfi reached 3 patches of palms, one a largish garden, Nakhel-sl-Hamthiyah is its name. Water about 15 © feet below the surface drawn by small cattle. Another -g- hour or so further on came on two other gardens the further being pretty large and pro tected by 3 towers. Water is so near the surface that, once established, the trees need no irri gation. I made out the water about 10 ft. below the surface. Water in all these gardens is fresh and plentiful.. Halted at 11.30 a.m, Ibn Dahai- man again gave trouble, coming up to the place where the Ameer of Zilfi and I were seated on the ground with Mullah Abdullah and putting down the shirt,drawers and shfiyah I had given them. He said they were too small meant for boy, not a man. The act done before the Ameer of Zilfi was as impertinence and I told him so. He therefore began to abuse the Mulla and all concerned. I must get rid of him either at once or from Boraidah. Left our resting place at 3.30 p.m. At about 4.45 p.m. passed two long valleys,that to the right called Saidaniyah and to the left Maarah near which is a road leading to Aneizah. Half an hour later we began to descend the Hefudh into a wide plain covered with shrubs. Here the Ameer of Zilfi, who was guiding us, pointed out the landmarks; on the right Burmah ( ) a dark hill of no great altitude 81 Jr-' - M Br rt- 15 - altitude but very conspicous in the slight undu lation. The plain in front of us they call the level valley which runs south-east to near Riyadh on the western side of J.Toweiq. This is the quickest route to Riyadh but is through the wil derness up to Sedus. We reached the foot of the Nefudh at 6 p.m. (just after sunset), when we alighted for prayers and coffee. Proceeded thence on level with plenty of camel grazing until 9.15 p.m, when we camped in a hollow. The Nefudh between Zilfi and Boraidah is very green with the shrub Athar plenty of grazing. on a deep and broad depression with four stone pillars built on the cliffs above. This Shaib Mohammed Ibn Rashid came here with his army when he conquered Kasim. We halted here 10.30 a.m. had our usual halt of 35 minutes,then on till 9.5 p.m. and encamped in charming little hollow in the Nefudh. Going was either over the level or among hummocks. At about 1-^- hours before sunset we came upon a deepish depression,running where we entered it, about dtae N.and S. Here wer* a long string of villages and walled gardens,which we perceived as we climbed the opposite hill. Sandhills or Nefudh,extended as far as eye could reach on both-directions. The village we descended into is called Shimasiyah* We watered our camels at a conduit of water drawn from a well about 70 75 ft.deep.

Started at about 7 a.m. after sunrise, sending on two riders to inform Turki Bin Saud of our arrival. When within a mile of % the fort, or Kasr, of Boraidah we were met by a troop of horse under Abbas w Beg M , They came up at a gallop while we halted on our camels, and gave us display of horseman ship lettin^pff their rifles and curvetting rounE us. Their mounts looked well, but were small, f«w of them more than 13-3 in height. A spare horse was brought for me, but I had my own animal. We rode through the town gates and then into the fort which is an imposing structure standing on high ground. It has six square towers and is rnachcolated. We dismounted and were led up 3 flights of mud stairs to a room about 30 ft,long and 16 broad with roof of rough ithal beams. The floor was deep soft sand. As I entered,Turki Bin Saud walked quickly towards me, shook hands and spoke very cordially, asking the usual questions about our health in a cordial manner. He took me to a seat at the head of the hall a sort of double seat with a window behind, through which armed men kept watch. He placed me on his left and tea, followed^coffee, was served. We conversed about the general situation he telling me that Ibn Rashid was now in Medina with Eakhri Pasha and IbnLailah at Damascus with Jamal Pasha.He enquired after news of the dear Government (the British) and I was able to tell him that on the day of my arrival at Baghdad ( 30th September) we had gained a nice victory over the Turks at Ramadi, taking 3,000 odd prisoners and 12 guns, I told him how the Turks wer caught and obliged to surrender, the Commander being one Ahmad Beg, He told me that all was peace at present on these borders. He gave me a letter from his father Bin Baud in which the latter said he was very busy in Riyadh at present but would like to see me there, when it suited,my convenience. My reception was extraordinarily good. I was offered a house in the town or tents outside, choosing the latter as that arrangement pleased them most they pitched 2 large tents for the men and one smaller but higher red tent for me. Abbas 'Beg” conducted me back to my camp after our re ception at the Palace, I riding back to camp on Turki 1 s mare. Our camp was on sand near a clump of ithal outside the N.E. face of Boraidah town wall which is about a mile long with walls about 15 ft.high and a graat fort about the eentre of the wsills with a tower at each corner and one in the centre. A large watch-tower is a conspicuous object in the rear face. Turki has a thin, pale face, of a sort of QjLd, ivory colour and smoothness, black eyes small but not set too close together, about 5’8'* in height. Intelligent and brave,! should say and a man fond of honour and with a penchant for higher ideals but somewhat effeminate,with the inevitable scamp of the favourite son. His face narrow general expression pleasing, boyish,rather tender. He has a look of his father,but is of quite a different build,being slight and rather fragile.I asked him about his grand-father Abdur Rahim’s health and learnt that he was well. 31st. October . Boraidah. Turki came at about 3.15. a.m. accompanied by the the Governor of the town, Abdulaziz bin Jaluwi ( ) and Abbas al Ralaji ( commonly referred to as Abbas M Beg M leading about one hund red horsemen,mostly African slaves. Before coming to the camp they galloped past me as I stood by a tent peg, firing rifles and revolvers,w iving swords and looking very warlike. I pretended to be duly impressed with this childish fantasia, which was intended as a special honour to me. Afterwards we had a raejlis in a large reception tent which Turki had had pitched for us. Tea, coffee and biscuits were partaken of and then Turki with the above mentioned personages adjourned with me to my private tent to discuss business. Ibn Rashid is at present in Medina with Rakhri Pasha, while Ibn Lailah is at Damascus with Jamal Pasha. Turki says Ibn Rashid has only about 400 men with him, but can always assemble the Shammar in case of urgent need and it is not possible to take Hail by a coup de main. The two main questions,whichi had to put to Turki, were f1) why he gave the Shammar caravan a letter to Sheikh Salim for musabilah at the end of September and (2) if it were possible for him to take Hail at this time when Ibn Rashid is obviously so weak. As regards (1). Turki says he only gave the Shammar a slip of paper addressed to all and sundry intended to be for a safe conduct among his tribes,lest they should inter fere with or attack them,He never meant to give them a pass for musabileh, on the way to Koweit.

Secondly,he knew that there w r as one village or suburb of Rail, which was strongly fortified and garrisoned by the Turks, His orders from his' father were to N seduce the Shammar and prevent them returning to Ibn Rashid while keeping the Mtair from raiding tribes which had sent quotas to fight under the Shereef. neither answer is really satisfying. The fact is that an informal truce exists among the tribes of both parties. Bin Baud’s policy is evidently approved of by all. The Bedouins one idea at the present moment is to share in the rich harvest of British subsi dies and the profits of blockade-running. November 1 st. Rode in early morning to S.W. of city through palm-gardens and on our way hoijae had coffee with one Ibn Pahush, I offered to go and call on T ur ki to take my leave,but received a message from him requesting me to stay in camp until the afternoon, when he w^ould himself some and start me on my way. Waited till 4 p.m. when he came out with all his horse including the Governor Abdulaziz Bin Jaluwi and the Arafah (Salman and another). * , Was very pleased and rode with me for mile, when he requested leave to return. He said he had just received word from his father sanctioning his return to Riyadh, as soon as he could be relieved by Pahad ibn Maamar the former Governor. I am glad I did not meet that surly indivudual. Boraidah people struck me,however,a not unfriendly: on the contrary they appeared glad to,see me and more frank than the Zilfies. Nevertheless,I hear from ray entourage that they are really inclined to be fanatical, though the palm for fanati -fanaticism must now be given to Artawiyah where, a!3^ the elect have migrated, Boraidah Bazaars are ijiost disappointing. The place struck me as under some evil spell and as most unprogressive h dly built,dirty and generally uncared for. The inhabitants have no great love for Bin Saud or for H a il wither. marched till 8.25 p.m., crossed the Wadi Burmnah at about 7.55 p.m. and seemed to be conti nuously in vicinity of date gardens till the last two miles. Halted on the height overlooking Anaizeh. IIovember 2n d, Descended to lower ground by a stony but not very dteep path and was met by nephew of the Ameer and two messengers. It appeares that I was expected yesterday and that the Ameer and principal people had ridden to the outskirts to meet me and there stayed till midday I apologised,explaining that my detention was due entirely to Turki’s asking me to wait. Had breakfast with Abdullah al Khalid al Abdullah tpho succeeded his uncle Abdulaziz al Abdullah this year. Had coffee and tea at houses of Abdulaziz Abdullah,al Hamad,Abdur Bahman ibn Abdulaziz bin Zamil, all of the Beni Salaim, a most courteous and refined family. -hey seemed to be men of the world,more enlightened and civilized than any Arabs I have met and with a charming franknessjuid independence of manner. They are ideal hosts. Abdullah ibn Idris met me on the way. He had just come from the Shereef’s son Faisal at Akaba. Abdulaziz bin Hasoon tells me he was present with Shakespear at the fight at Jarab W where he was wounded with a sword on the shoulder and left for dead. He was eventually picked up by some of Bin Saud’s men and carried in 2 daysdays via Artawiyah to Zilfi, When sufiiciently recovered he joined the ^hereof vho at that time was on the side of the Turks, After the Shereef had cast off the Turks,our friend continued in his service. He spoke a lot about Lawrence with Faisal at Akabah and said he was almost like Bedouin all the tribes knew him. Nejdis were all called Agaili down south and received pay from the Shereef at the rate of £ 6 a month. Those employed on 'dynamite” operations for destroying the railway got £,15 p.m. At least 1000 men he said have gone from here to assist the Shereef andjabout 4,000 from Kasim have gone also to the Hejaz to earn pay. News is that Ibn Kashid left Medina and went to A1 Hejr, I do not altogether agree with Handbook of Arabia regarding its comparison bet- ween Boraidah and Aneizah.as a handsomely built town. The aristocracy are mostly related and very united. Their corporate life is like that of a mediaeval Italian republic with their elective Ameer chosen from the princely house of Bin Halim. Boraidah is larger,if the environs and suburbs are taken into account, and is per haps more populous. My own belief is that Aney- zah has at least an equal settled population and its bazaars are infinitely better in every way, the shops larger,better stocked and kept. As for the people,there is no comparison;the people of Aneyzah are by comparison highly civilized. j T he best of them have travelled at least to Koweit,Bahrain,Basrah,Karachi and Bombay,while many of them have gone far afield to the west and are acquianted with Damascus.Beirut and Constantinople. Gave all my party ten dollars each to \to spend in Aneyaah. The Ameer invited us all to lunch and dinner. Our Bedouins ate enor mously the food being excellent. The Ameer has been very good to us. Feeling in Aneyzah is, I thin, strongly for us. After dinner at 5 p.m, this evening 1 e walked in the bazaars. I saw nothing worth buyi ing, but was again struck with the picturesque and truly imposing architecture of the pala- zzos of the great ones with their adjacent gar dens all highly cultivated,the walls being covered with vines,and surrounded by fig trees pomegranates,peaches,etc. Some of the gardens looked as though they would afford delightful retreats in sultry weather. On the whole,Aney zah is a place to rave about when you come in from the desert. It is quite unspoilt by con tact with modernism. I should say there were nc paupers: I waw no signs of suqualor. The state of civilization of Aneyzah shows that the Arab even when left entirely to himself and almost isolated from the world of progress does not altogether let himself go,but retains some ideals and aspirations. He does not become brutalized or insensible to the amehities of life and social intercourse or generally to the softening influences of comfort and ele gance. Some of the rooms of the houses I was shown through w r ere beautiful, one, a coffee- room of Abdulaziz,the retired Ameer, was particularly artistic. It was about 18 ft. broad and 30 ft.long. Hound the room were open corridors and the room itself had gallery with^i grille under the roof, a sort of prome nade for the ladies whocome to see and hear what goes on in the coffee hall below. Some texts from the Koran were artistically painted X j m I m ILIIJIpainted, on the walls on rough mouldings: in the luminous gloom the effedt was very pleasant if 'bizarre. The utter absence of symmetry or line rather offends the European’s eye but these interiors fascinated me ,and, after all,any at-4 tempt to symmetry would have been out of keep ing with^he general\outside and inside design. I never saw a plumb line outside or inside nor any striving after balancing or matching things. Aneyzah is like a gem roughly cut by the hands of some barbarian workman; yet the result is such that one would on no account have the gem recut in modern fashion even were that possible. Abdul1ah-al-Hamad came after sunset to bid me goodbye. He is a nice fellow. Hovember 3 rd. Marched at 6-55 a.m. and halted at 10-5 a.m. Sent on Motlag-al-Hami (Mtair, sent by Turki) along with Muhammad Ibn Dahabas to convey a letter to the Shaikh of Muchnib, Eahad, Agaili, informing him of our intended arrival at the tow r n to—morrow’ at daylight* * * Our general direction today was S.S.E., over hard ground stony with very little vege tation for the most; our landmarks, two cliffs on the right of the road, from which it is said to descend direct on to the palms of Al-Mudh- nib. From our halting place through a gap on the left of the road to Mudhnib (H.E.), saw a depression with palms which are aaid to be Aziziyah village. Last night Ali -al-Dhowaihi,who is con tinuing along with us to Riadh,said he had high fever and might not be able to start next day.

Started at 3.10 a.m. and got to a place near Mudhnib, marching ritill over undulating stony ground, waited r or sunrise and then started to town and met two riders sent out by the Ameer to meet us, he went to his place and there had tea and coffee. The coffee-hall was a long, darkish room with a large firepit at one end, in which stood 8 or 9 large coffee-pots. As usual plenty of carpets and a cushioned corner to the right of the hearth looking down the hall. Conversa tion for about an hour, and then went off to our camp to dress and wash. Some talk about Shaekspear, who passed through here in the spring of 1912 when returning from Kiadh. Ameer tells me that Bin Saud makes this a regular half when passing backwards and for- &lt;i wards to Kasim. The route by the Kistawi is more even going and better for camels as far as grazing is concerned, but this way“through the villages 11 as they say, is nearer and has the great advantage of plenty of water at short stages and supplies. But, if I return I shall go by the Mistawi. One marches better in the desert; these villages lead lounging and general carelessness in ones followers, As for safety there is not much to choose between the two for a small party. A large party, say of 20 riders, would however be be absolutely safe by this route and not ao by the desert way. tribes have-25- Tribes have 'to be faared on the Mistawi and robbers in Woshm. Mudhnib is more like an Indian village than an Arab one. The soil is all clay,and absolutely flat,there is no trace of sand any where. Large standing fields of millet and barley; the gardens scattered around. The village is not fortified but has a single Kasr. I am told that they have no enemies to fear. Over 100 of the inhabitants have gone to the Hedjaz to take service under the Shereef. kahad Ibn Abdul Karim is a charming personality. He is about 40 years of age, has been 25 years Ameer of the place succeeding his father as a lad of 15. He has never tra velled. There are 30 houses of Agal,mostly Beni Tamim stock. One fort in town; villages surround.the town to a aistance of 2 roileo. The population under 3000. I offered the Ameer a present of smart Aba and 70 dollars but he absolutely refused to take anything saying that as faithful servant of Bin Saud he could not do so without the lattei 1 s pei - mission. This is unusual,! think,as both the Ameer of Zilfi and Abbas-al-Balaji both accepted the 0 70, which I gave them. I forgot perhaps to mention that the whole p trt ty with me including men from Kowait and Mohammerah and from Turki received 10 dollars each as pocket money to spend in Kasim. The chief peculiarity o*f Al -Mudhnib is the absolute flatness of the plain on which it is built. Stony cliffs enclose the depression: its apparent openness to attack on all sides is also a noticeable feature. The inhabitants answered my M Salaam-Alekum” ( ) r aWL I(dI m - 5~o Dist. ]'i Miles.

I observed no Surliness,but this due to the fact that I am passing through the country as the honoured guest of Bin Saud and accompanied by his special^ messengers Bami-Al-Bair ( and Sa-ad, Ajmi. The water of this place is salty and aperi tive. No-one drinks except from one veil at Kasr Ibn Saud. r i’hat water,which is about 45 ft. below the surface, is really good and sweet: .the best we have drunk since leaving Kowait. Left at 1.25, in afternoon, and halting for half an hour at Kasr Ibn Saud which i hours march from the town (about 1-J- miles). We reached Murrabba ( fS) at 5.10 p.m. % November.5th . Left Gamp at 5 a.m. and came within sight of Ain as Sweini and halted for breakfast at 10.10 a.m. All day long passed through good camel pasture,now and then coming on patches of green. -‘■he depression appeared to extend about 7 or 10 miles to the West. Passed fort Kasral-Araar ( ) about 9.25 a.m. at a distance l£ miles from the road to the West. Kasr-al-Watheilan ( ) (small ithel bushes) a little further on. Started again at 1 p.m., having sent on Thami and Mirshid to inform the Ameer,Dakhil- ullah, of our arrival before sunset. Reached Ain-al-Jareifah at about 4.40 p.m. A horseman came out to welcome us. We rode in with him to the village coffee room,just inside the fort gate,which faces North. This is compact forti fied village with several 2-storeyed house and numerous square towers, all new r looking and loopholed.

Left about sunrise 6.15 a.m. Marched first through the Ayun-es-Sirra depres sion to foot of Nefudh which we reached after about li hours march . Hirst f hour marched S.o.E. along line of the springs. After 3 hours marching passed Ain Ibn Sakran (water from springs and extensive gardens).Hal ted at V 10.25 a.m, in Nefudh; very hot. The tempera ture this morning down to 56°. Heard story of Bin Baud’s treachry towards and defeat by Ajman. Salman-al-Arafah whom I met at Poraidah was with the Ajman at the time. Bin Baud had sent 2 men to the Ajman in the afternoon to make a trace till morning,but was over persua ded by Bin !aluwi and his brother Sad to attack at dusk. Left at 2 in the afternoon and reached hollow/ in Bands at sundown - Abdulaziz Hasoon cheeky went to strike my pony for trying to rob dates. Told him to drop it and let pony alone. November 8th .

Star ted at 1.20 p.m. and left Hefudh at 1.30 after noon, and passed through stony plain and depres sion out of which rose half a dozen detached stone-hills of the shape of a round cake. From the summit of the plateau above depression we looked down to Bhakra nd Sheijar which latter lies about 3 miles North of our road Sheijar is a larger town than Mudhnib. Beyond Sheijar we saw the ruddy Nefudh and further back the chal-like cliffs of deb el Toweiq. We halted at b. 25 p.m. (sunset) having sent on Thami-al- Bair and Ali-al-Dhowaihi with letter to the Ameer Mohamred Bin Saud,Al-Aisa. He has been appointed Ameer by Bin Saud. He is a man of about 45 years old. Came to our tents and brought us off to a good breakfast.

The Shakra market is small, like that of Zilfi but it is a larger town, sours.' rounded by gardens. It has been welldescribed as a lesser Anaizeh.

Marched into Shakra at about 7.10 a.in, A horseman was sent out to meet us. Breakfast with Ameer. Camped in open North-East of the town in Band, Mulla thinks that Shakra contains more than 5 to 6 thoue sand inhabitants. He says it is about 2/3rd or fth size of Anaizeh and considers the po pulation to be as high at 15000. Putting Anaizeh at an outside figure of 12,000 I should say,thre might be 8000 souls in Shaqra Had dinner at about 2.40 p.ra.with the Ameer and then departed,catching up the bag gage about i hour later. After leaving Shakrs climbed up the rocky side of the depression and stopping at the top and looking back wit&gt; binoculars had a good view over Shaqra,which lies very low 1 . It is not more than bhe size of Anaizeh. Has 5000 to 6000 inhabi tants possibly. Node on to within sight of palms of Tharmidah and halted at sunset 5.25. p.ra. in open patch putting up some gazelles and a pair of bustard,which Anar tried to stalk; ground hard,country all along Nefudh level loam plain and covered with fortified granges,looking like castles and called Kasrs (castles), November 10th , Started at 7 a.m. and rode straight into Tharmidah,having sent Thami and Sa-ad on head to warn Ameer,Abdul Rahman- al-Angari, who it seems formerly. - 30- Czx? formerly resided at Kowait. His first cousin was the Ameer of Tharmidah when it held out against Bin Saud who heseiged it. The cousin was put to death for his resistance. Gardens of Thar midah delightful:water in wells 60 feet Below surface. Saw 2 wells one with 9 and one 10 'buckets working; each waterskin drawn By Bullock, cow or donkey with a short,steep run down on Both sides. Wells here mostly worked By cattle curing hours of day only. Some few wells worked by camels as in Kasim. Plenty of maize and Bajra (Dukha) and Dux, some lirne-trees-Melons, Pumkins, and vegetables grow in profusion: air delightful people look very much of the cultivating class add are said to Be mostly 'Beni Tamim, Outside stalls in ruins. At the Ameer, ABdur uahman’s house had coffee,tea and dates and then went and spent an hour or two looking at wells and chatting in gardens with Hullah ABdullah,Amar and Thami, Thami has had 12 wives,all except 2 he says were girls,tne other 2 oeing grown women. He did not keep any of them long, ihe lad who was with us was the Ameer’s servant very poor, said his only chance of getting a woman was. to go/on a raid with Bin S a ud -Otherwise he would remain a poor,wifeless wretch to the end of his days. The Ameer is a man of about 50 years old and a regular type of townbred Arab most friend ly. There seem to Be a good many of the Akhwan about here. My 'Salam-Aleks' were not infre quently ignored. There has Been some hot air in camp; Ali-al-'fnowahi has Been growling against Abdul Aziz Bin Hassoon and the latter and the Hulla are not on good terms. Thami-al-Bair shoutedshouted out the call to prayers and led crowd hut Ali-al-Thowaihi,who was praying with them went off hurriedly at the end,saying in the hearing of all 'I don’t want any more of this”. The fact is that Thami is the biggest rip in these parts and he bungled the call to prayers badly. Mirdhid went up to him and gave him a lessonjvery funny. And Thami said alright,it did not matter. All the crowd hate and redi- cule the Akhwan. I must get a clear account of their tenets. Last night,an interesting conversation with Thami-al-Bair and Mirshid two Shammaris who were retainers of Abdulaziz Shaikh 0.1 the Shammar when they marched victoriously through the towns of Wosham and Sedeir, I asked them, if Bin Saud could take Hail with guns - Thami said 'Do you want the truth - Yes ? well, every mother’s son of us Shammar would come back and help to defend Hail - and Abdulaziz wioh all his talk and his thousands of tribes-men would never get near the place”. Mirshid said with a laugh. Last year Bin Saud had 7000 men and there were only one thousand Shammar with Ibn Rashid,but Bin Saud did not dare to attack Hail and withdrew. November.IQt h. Left Tharmidah in afternoon at 1.2b p.m. and marched along parallel oo Mefudh among many fortified farms,some of which look rat hCt di1apitated. Cultivation by lain and wells sunk within the forts. Occupied from December enwards,till harvest is gathered. Gamp near Nefudh at sunset 5.25.p.m. There has been a lot of hot air about in camp lately, are all a bit travel-weary and irritable. Ali-al-Thowaihi is angry with Abdulaziz because he wont give him a riding camel-32- camel and with me because I only give him fifty dollars at Boraidah. Mullah Abdullah is very wroth with Abdulazfz,who is far from being popular all round. It was a delightful night and not too foy U. 33 ^ cold. Diet: 174&gt;nb&amp;wu N ovember 11th . Started at 5.25 about hour Miles, before daybreak, and rode hard to Bar rah which I reached in under 3 hours. The baggage took exactly 6 hours to cover the distance which I estimated was about 18 miles:not less. This is the best that the baggage has done yet, their usual all round pace being about 2-f- miles , When pressed, how T ever, 4 or 4-g- is not hard for them to do for 2 or 3 hours. Had coffee uith^ /(the Ex-Ameer, who was disgraced and dismissed for taking the part of Ibn Rashid in the struggle with Bin Saud. All the village came :i in after coffee. Afterwards ate pancakes and. butter then after coffee at the ex-Ameer’s house went to camp and had lunch consisting of a cold bustard shot by Araar yesterday with his 303 rifle. A jolly good shot hitting the bird in the head. The last time I yaw the like was last winter on the way to Jajara wben Ammad-al-Jabir shot a dove through the neck at 50 yards with a Mauser, Eahad-al-Dhafiri and Eatlan Mtair came to have sore eyes washed. The other Eahad, whose eyes were raally bad, got quite well after 2 operations. An inquisitive group of villagers came to ask me if I knew anything about the Bahul. I told them all there was in the handbook of Arabia, which was more than they themselves had any know ledge of. They were greatly impressed. Was asked today whether it was true that the * Bowla (the Government), meaning the Ottoman'Rdt^JUS. &lt; Miles. . BMP . . . jcr^v. &gt;auM -34- /V5; clifflike sides. I saw orrly one path across them to the right and one on the left. These were mere sheep tracks impossible for loaded camels. Saw some small partridges in rocks. After crossing the watershed we came on to a long plain, ending in the head of Wadi Hanifah. Here,too,begin the extensive and imposing ruins of Al-Ai vain ah ( ** V This old town was about miles long. The torrent banks are revetted wi tinstone masonry without mortar, rough ly dressed. Many wells,much liket&amp;ose of today but with no water in them. At Aljubailah ( i ) is a mud village among the ruins S of the old town but the only inhahabitant appea red to be an old negro who has a house and a patch of cultivation there. He looks after tra vellers and is,I think,a guard of Bin Baud’s. Hovembe r 12th » Started at 6.15 a.m. and halted at 11 a.m. by some trees at the ruined village of Aljubailah (see above). There was one well above this: here there are two,one of which is at the foot of the ruined village. The water at Ayainah (one well) is at a depth of 96 it. at Jubailah 84 ft.at Daraiyah 72 ft.at Riadh 84 ft.at Barrah about 48 ft. The negro told me that Abdulaziz Bin Baud and his escort rode X here in 12-jj*- hours from Riadh 2 months ago. The cemetary at Jubailah is very extra ordinary: the graves are exposed on the side of the Wadi by diluvion action. These graves are said to be those of the Companions or of the followers Khalid Bin Waleed and other worth -ies of early Mohammedan times.- Plenty of wood cutters with their camels on the Wadi ol Hani- fa:each camel load fetches in Riadh li or 2 dollars. Today I rode more or less all the time with the baggage,but yesterday afternoon went off with Sad (Ajman) A-amar,the Mullah r.Dis t T em; ■ Miles. 58°. Bar: 3190’ . Mullah and Bahad Dhafiri. Vve set up a target, after some private camel racing in which my camel usually by far the fleetest did not dis tinguish herself greatly. She is a hit tired out I think. The baggage thought we were being attacked and sent on all their riders to help us. Nights very windless:the days much the same. Only two or three cloudy nights since we left and never one with wind;always slept in the open. Abdulaziz Bin Hasoon complained. This led to a big row (Abdulaziz’s last .tight for independance - Since then he has been a 1amb). Continued inarch down Wadi Hanifa. ihe Wadi,as it is familiarly called in these parts, is said to rise behind the village oi Awainib and Al-Garadan (see November 11th. above),a scarp which stands out very promi nently almost due South of Barrah village which we passed on our right about 2 miles out from Barrah. I could not make out exactly where Hasiyah ends and where Hanifa begins, but I think it is some-where in the vicinity of Ayainah to the North-West of the ruins. Reached Daraeiyah about ^ hour before sunset with half a dozen riders and found plenty of lucerne and wood, also,later,some milk and eggs collected by Sad and Ibn Dahibas who had been sent on ahead. Met a lad about 12 years of age of the As-Baud family who came down to our camp-fire on the Wadi bed to chat with us. His name is Hadhlul ( *3^ ) and belongs to the Al-laluwi branch. November 13t h. Started at 6.5. a.m. and reached the outskirts of Riadh at 8.4b a.m. We were met 2 miles out ol Aiadh at a largelarge tree 'by Abdulaziz Ibn Rabaie and 5 horsemen who give us the usual exhibition of horsemansiiip but without letting off rifles. One of them lell off. Reached at Riadh,met at a palace gates and conducted to Majlis where all the principal ohaikh assembled. Sat on right of Abdulaziz Bin Baud.The whole length of the top wall was unoccupied except by two us:then Mohammed Ibn Abdurrahman,Abdulazizs brother, an extremely influential man in hejd,Bai- sal Ibn Rashid (refugee from Hail),Mullah Abdullah my Header,Salih-al-Adil,Ibrahim Bin Mohammad bin Saif (of Koweit) Abdullah Bin Saud,Saud brother of Abdulaziz and 5 or 6 of the Araif were among the principal notables present. Afterwards went fox- private talk in the Maktab, or office, of bin Baud. Then breakfast. At 2 p.m. visited Abdurrahman Bin Saud, the Imam, as he is generally called, an old mar with safron coloured beard about 70 years of age a charming personage. We were conducted to a bright reception room, w r ith loftv roof 3 centxal pillars and doors at both ends but in ipnosite corners of the rectangle:triangular windows high up on walls let in plenty of light,good carpets and cushions X'ound walls. Long conversation, chiefly on general politics, Abdurrahman is yellow in face with; the dark, clear mocrutabl.e eyes of the true and wise, resembling remarkably those of Lord Roberts. He is as strongly pxo- British now, as he v/as when Raunkiaer met him before the war in 1912. The latter remarked of him. ”0n the last subject^ the relative power of European states especially in the matter of Africo-Asiatic politics,! could dono more than confirm the chieftains deeprooted belief in the hegemony of the British Empire*’.

Saw bullet marks in frmae of huge door. There were /0 defendexs but these surrendered after 20 of them had been killed and wounded. Long talk with Ameer in his private room,served with tea by a pretty boy, In came Abdul• lah-ai-Hakim a young Medical of Mosul,who had got his degree in Constantinople. Handsome,french-look ing, about 30. Speaks french fairly well.Also came Ahmad Bin Thanaiyan of the As-Baud family. Old- looking young man with ’’tender eyes”, as the Bible hath it,understands french very well,was born in Constantinople, Ameer suspicious about me,wants to know if I came to find out all about him and to criticize him- what do we want of him - He has carried out all he proraised,vhich was to neutralize Ibn Rashid out for his (B.S.) menace the Shereef would not have been in a position ever to rebel against the Turks,Ibn Rash id would have put a stopper on any^n.ovement oi his in that direction. So the fact that the Shereef has been able to keep the field so long against the 3bax Turks,(even if his early success had been possible otherwise) is due to Bin baud's neutralizing the power of Ibn Rashid. Yet Bin Baud’s action is not given proper credit by us. He has to heal himself traduced: people even saying that he is secretly helping Ibn Rashid to hpld out against us - becuase he is supposed to be j ealous of the oheree... If he were so, which is not the truth, there would be some reason for his jealousy. The Shereef has secured a great position,he has got hold of the Harb and Ataibah tribes which belong to Bin Baud and also ^ some thousands of Kasimis or Ageylis as they are called:all subjects to Bin Baud. Have we not poured gold into the Hej az? Here on this axis side ki: ■■-38- side everything has got dear. Riyals had appreciated (the relative value to the sovereign being $ 5-£ in Anai- zeh ^ 6|- in Kiadh). Camels are dear and clothes too. Rice is now far more expensive than before the war. The Turks in Madina and Syria are.getting supplies through the Shammar and Anaizeh.who have come in to us and so on and so on. Bin Baud's complaints are numerous. Money and supplies would doubtless put a fresh complexion on mat ters. V’e spoke about Ibn Rashid and the possibility of knocking him out. At first Bin Baud said it was an im possible task. Ibn Rashid was a Shaikh of a single power, ful tribe -which would unite at once for self-defence in case of Hail being attacked. He (Bin Baud) con'd of course call on his tribes the Mtair, Ahl-Hurrah,Dawasir, Sbei, Ataibah,Barb,Beni,Hajar, BeniKhalid, Dhafn , Anazeh etc. All of them would gather at the bidding but would be a large mob, difficult to control or to keep concen trated for more than few days in one locality. So that any tiling like prolonged operations against Hail n h «Juch levies was not to be thought of. Besides the busi ness of gettingthese numerous clans together,he has to arrange for the safety of his provinces of Kasim, and Hassa and to leave strong Governors of his family with sufficient garrisons. A revolt of the Ahl Murrah or an attack by the Ajman might prove disastrous,if it took piuce while he was far away with all his fighting men. Thus the first thing to be thought of when planning a distant operation would be the internal defence garri sons. The Shereef's system of paying a monthly wage to individual .Arabs of £ 6 a month or whatever the amount, was tantamount to waking mercenary soldiers of them: this was not in his opinion an expedient method for him (B.S.) to adopt. His tribesmen wer&lt;f aj ahiddin who served and fought for honour not for pay. However he could easily do the same if necessary and perhaps accomplish better results. But with his subsidy of £ 5,000 p.m. it was impossible all he could do was to keep 4 1^11 M! i J JI .IIIJ ) .U'lHI-39- keep a force in Kasim to check the Shammar and keep his trikes in hand. If he were to attempt to overcome Hon Rashid,he must have all the means required. He did not wish to share the fate of the English General who, he says, was sent Home a prisoner for having attempted to take Baghdad with inadequate troops and material. I told him that the object of the Mis sion of the officers now on their way from Hassa to discover a plan for his effective co-operation with us and the Shereef in the work of expelling the Turks from the Peninsula. Doubtless we would be able to hit on some arrangement after discussion. But what- was his idea ? He said. Firstly . The economic question He should have control of all his tribes in the matter of Musabileh (access to markets) at Katif, ^atar.Koweit, Zobair,Basrah,Khamsiyab,Sukes- Sheyukh and the Euphrates including Nejif and Kerbe- la. He would keep his agents there: one agent in each market-town, who alone would be able to recom mend grant of passes to the blockade officers therein. This would force the Shammar and northern Anizeh, Dhafir, and others to turn to him and then a few months might make a great difference. Secondly. He must have more pecuniary support, Kovembdr 14 th.Went to the office of the Ameer where was an informal Majlis,at which I talked with the Ameer for about ■§- of an hour. Many subjects: the Balkans Russia,the submarine campaign,Shakespear» s refusal to believe that there could ever be a European- War again and how he showed him a quota tion from the Q.uran or the traditions that Moham mad had foretold this world conflagration.

Rode back. After supper with our company, the Mulla and rest went off to prayers in the mosque in the palace. I sat writing until it 8 p.m., when I went over to Bin Saud’s private room and stayed till 10.25 discussing politics. Bin Baud told me of a wonderful dream he had about the capture of Damascus and it s destruction by him. He that he thought with some help he and his tribes could capture Damascus. I said that was a splen did idea. Of course Hail and the Shammar stand in the way. Ibn Rashid cannot be bought: of that bin Saud is certain. Nor can he be brought over tc our side because it is fundamental policy of Hail and the Shammar to lean on the Turks, so as to remain independent of Nejd, November 15th . Attended Majlis in Bin Saud’s office. Sat next to Faisal Ibn Rashid, r,e fugitive beyond him was Ibn Faroon ( ) (Abu Hamdi as he is called) and his nephew Hussa [I ) another nephew Saoii ( )-41- ^ (fl) is til so in Riadh. Babri has a lair beaid and is very German-looking, Ibn Raroon is a small fat man of about 40 with a limp. Musa is tall and dark. Ibn Raroon used to be a great friend of Bin Bauds. The latter now keeps him as a prison er but allow him some liberty. Many people say that the old friendship between them still contim* nues, sub rosa, and the confinement of Ibn laroon is a mere pretence. The Ameer was not keen on my seeing him in my rooms. Had a long talk with Abdu -11ah al-Hakim and Ahmad Bin Thamaiyan. At 2.30 p.m. went for a ride with Bin Baud and most of the As Baud family,including half a dozen little boys,Bin Baud led a sort of war-dance on horse back and after galloping round for about half an hour we v r ent and sat under a mud v r all in che sun, while the horses were off-saddled and allowed to roll in the sand* Bin Baud fired two shots with a revolver and 10 with a rifle without hitting the mark, except once. A stone v r as stuck up at a distance of 150 yards. We then came back to the town in procession. After dinner at 8 p.m. went to the Ameer as usual and heard a torrent of talk mostly against Salim (Shaikh of Koweit) till 10.30 p.m. when we retired. Bin Baud seems ■worried and neavy-gets easily carxied away by the exuberance of his word-flow. Friday.November 16th . Majlis at 8.30 this morn ing. Found Ameer alone. Letters brought from Hassa - Bin Baud very depressed about Italian reverses description situation by Reutei capable of resulting in a Rumanian debacle has given him a fright. Our success at Beer-Sheba did not make up for it. After breakfast Ahmad Bin Thanaiyan came and discussed politics.

Had a little fever last nigh' nightiam sweating it out today, bent for a lice on camel at 1.45 (A) returned in tine to attend Maj lis at 3 . 10( Arabic). Met Ameer. several other mem bers of As Saud family present, also Xbn i’arlon and his nepjiew Musa and Faisal Ibn Rashid. After breakfast came Abdullah al Hakim and endeavoured to persuade me to put my ideas of what Bin baud should do on paper. I said that I must wait for the arrival of these two officers from Hassa and see anyinstructions they might be bringing v-~h them, But that our preliminary conversations had been of great value. I had quite a good general notion of what the .Ameer's ideas were and what he was able to attempt. The capture of Hail is the first, in fact the only problem we have at present to face. The fall of Hail would mean in all probability the collapse of Medina. Bin bauds main idea is his position in Central Arabia (now and after the war). The question now was a two fold one. Was he to maintain his present attitua tude and carry out his part of the bargain made at Koweit in November 1916 (Vide p.ll of Presis regarding relation of British Government with Bin Saud) i.e. maintain a force in Kasim of 4000 men to hold Ibn Rashid in check and attack him if opportunity occurred - or to take a more active line ? In either case his finances must be bolster*! up, but in the latter case he would require munitions and money far in excess of his present allowances and on par with the subsidies granted to the Shereef. In fact we should regarc-43* (5 regard and equip him as a British Division. It is obvious that taking a more active part means atta^ -ing the Sharamar and endeavouring to capture Hail. It would he suicidal to make the attempt without adequate means in i^oney, supplies, armed forces, and war material. There cannot he,he went on saying, the least douht that hut for his attitude and his keeping, in .check, not only his own tribes hut that of Ihn Kashid alone made it possible for the Shereef to act with any freedom against Turks now* Bin Saud is not in least avaricious:in fact his fault lies in the other direction i,e.in ex cess of generosity. But he must have more money to hold his tribes together. Turki at Boraidah had altogether run out of provisions such as ricej etc. and that was one reason why he had to leave and come away to Kiadh. The monthly cost of up keep of 4,000 men at Boraidah would not he less than ^ 56,000 or £.9,400/- at the rate of ^ 14 per man per month - ^ 6 5 £.1 (the rate in Aneyzah was * £ 1). I myself think that £. 10,000 per mensem and another 3,000 rifles with ammunition and some light guns would he suffi cient to maintain the present somwwhat inactive plan. The cost of large operations would have to he worked out by some other method. The Shereefs men are paid at £6 p.ra. or $ 36 p.m. Bin Saud would prefer the system of tribal allowances. If major operations are undertaken v/ho are the enemy and what is their strength ? They are Shammar and Ajman. The Ajman would have to he eliminated first,either by our making a special arrangement with them (e.g. to give hostages from every main clan to remain peace fully ka in Zuhair and Koweit) or by attacking them all round and them taking on the Shammar. Any attack upon Hail would bring all section togethe: to defend place. They are xk a strong tribe, 1 ' - ' ii iuui. .x.w . u -. ..i ....... 1 'tvt *' -'n 1-44- *kP ?is Moreover they have the Turks close to their back- door. In evening again spent couple of hours talking to Bin Saud. Nove mber 17th . At 8 a.m. rode out with Bin Saud to meet Turki. He and his cavalry charged passed on the Wadi bed firing their rifles and pistols and shooting as they passed Bin Baud,who »at on the rim.of a well in the shadow of a wall. This gallop past was repeated three times and then there were greetings and hissings and general rejoicing. Aft-e. After that I returned to town. Had an interview at 8 p.m. as usaal with Bin Saud, discussed tribal matters. Talking about our policy with the Arabs, or for that matter the policy of any outside power we should, he hinted,be making a great mistake if we imagined we could mould such unstable material to our will. He compared Arabs to their country: every now and then there was a great ilood (se&gt;l) which swept everything away buildings,gardens and homes,down the Wadi. He likes to think that the Shereef’s power is very temporary,built on our largesse only. As soon as the money fails, the trives will return to their old allegiance and look to Nej d as the fountain of liberty, secular and religious. Hence his interest in the Wahabi revivalist movement called the Ikhwan*. His religious leadership will,he hopes in the long run carry him on some such wave to the Empire of Arabia: the dream of ail the Bin Bauds. November 18th . Rode in the morning as usual on camel with Mullah, Mirshed and Aamar. Bid some photography afterwards. Afternoon,Abdulla, the doctor,came to talk.

At 8 p.m. again went tor one hour’s cheat with Bin Saud. He explained that his trouble with IBn SuBah (Kuwait) was not really connected with the question of taxation of the Awazim, for, though he did clair. che latter as his subjects really,he was content to leave them to IBn SuBah:the quarrel was really about the Ajman. After their going off, conti ary to their- agreement and joining with the Sharamar to oppose him last winter and spring,he could not remain on any sort of terms with they.. It w T as unfriendly of IBn £ubah-to harbour them now. He would not hear of any further pardon. It was useless,as we knew,Because their Shaikhs were unrepentent.

The wells, twelve in number,hold good water, 84 feet to water- in evening at this time of year:but as at least 2000 camels have been watering before us, the level has probably gone down.

There was a boy with them called Misnid Ibn Khathaiyim,about 14 years old,very pleasing in appearance. Our direction at starting was 10° West of North.

This alteration of our course was, so the guide told us, in order to hit off the broad Jaham ( ^I^a) ridge at its narrowest. Sand-ridges very steep on North side, but generally speaking the marches are easier in gradient than further west and firmer and more covered with vegetation,especially with nussi grass which is wonderful here. Have not been well last 3 days feverish cold. Yesterday hawked hare and today a fat bustard.

Nearly lost the hawk but Mirshed got it back by working a pair of bustard wings and calling ’’Thiab- Thiah”. Passed the last ridge of Dahana and entered Summan at 1.45 p.m. The Jehcim is the broadest of all the seven ridges. Such wonderful grazing,camel shrubs and nussi grass I have never seen anywhere as this afternoon: indeed these last three days we have passed a wonderful grazing country. The north ern slopes of the Dahana ridges are far steeper than* the southern. Had dinner in my tent with Abdulaziz bin Hasso on, Abdullah,Mirshed, and Aamar to eat the bus-r tard and hare.

The hares have, all of thegi got deep holes in the rocky summits of these hills Hounds get their feet cut about by stones. The hawk did not like the weather today.

Marched in bitter cold rain with gusts of sleet un until 10.15 a.m. when we halted for breakfast. Guides said wells of al-Haba still 3 or 4 hours distant. However, after marching on for about another hour we came suddenly on the hill over looking the wells. Decided to stop abort of wells,as we are wet and uncomfortable and want fuel more than water. There is never fuel nor grazing in the vicinity of important wells. Camp ed at 12.15 p.m. Have still got the Ajman ladies marching in our wake,one is an aunt and the others connections of Shaikh Dhaidan Ibn Hathlain I send/food,for which they are greatful and dally send thanks.

In Riadh he learnt that they had come by ship from the Hej az. He said th it Rin Saud wanted only to mal himself strong and was taking all he cottld from both sides. He meant to make Ibn Subah (Koweit) acknowledge ^hi# suprwnacy and to attack him f if i^e would not comply. Meanwhile the Koweit standard is at Garah,two days this side of Subaihiyah. Dabbi believes that the Sbei are out raiding again st Koweit. Of course Bin Baud's policy is self- sen tred. He possibly thinks what the Central Powers will get the upper hand, at least in Asia Minor. He wishes to consolidate his power over all the Arab tribes of Nejd, Hejaz and East Syria. Dreams of the restoration of the ephemeral v ahabi. Empire of former days undoubtedly are the main spring of his policy. Chat is why he is foscering the Ikhwan revival at Arthawiyah. The Dahana are receiving daily accessions. When at Riadh it was the Ataibah,now I hear that the majority of the Mtair and some Shammar have been converted. ihis is a militant Wahabi revival:they consider any intercourse with Christians to be pollution,while the rather loose Mohammadans of Kow^eit are treated as misbelievers. Therefore the Ikhwan are hated in Koweit. Old Saris al-Amaid of the Mtair how ever sold that he had not gone over. He,for instance, did not believe in therrr.he was not going to lie, he said. Bin Saud thinks that the Ikhwan will make a splendid fighting nucleus. They are real fanatics. My reader,Abdullah ibn Abdulillah a very devout Mohammad ,n who always le .ds prayers in my camp and is regarded as a iearned Mulla s ^ that the Ikhwan are ignorant and ill-conditioned.‘in Vi'ft r-r?h r r m r— / ^3 y/. ^' Dist: Miles, Tem: 49°. Bar:2120’ According to him the worst thing about them is 'their intolerance of their co-religionists, whom they call Kafirs (Yakafarum ghair Musalmin). My experience the Arabs here and else where in Mesopotamia is that they regard us as softies. England to them, is a sort of fairy god-mother ,rolling in wealth,kindly and silly. This attitude does us no harm,no more than the prosperous man’s patronizing of the Almighty harms the latter or deflects Him a hairs-breath from his enexorable designs, Asa policy in contrast to that of German; frightxulness, hri oieh softness and apparent blindness has paid us well, We h av e roped in the who 1 e wo rid there by, Anile Germany has only secured Bulgaiia, Still going over this uninteresting Sumrnan steppe: following what is apparently a long valley but is actually a succession of such valleys:the longeiykxes of which run IT, and S. and thus f acili tate our way,forming in fact a sort of sunken road: innumerable paths lead off on both sides. Have sometimes left eg ad for a few miles and ever where found a net-work oi such patns,any one of which if followed takes the general uirecuion of the main road. The main road is called Makatti ( or the putting. Many Salubba about, but no oilier Arabs come this w r ay at this’ time of year.

Got off at about 11.35 a.m. but went to the wells to water the horses and sheep,of which ten only remain of the flock of 20 presented to us by Abdulaziz (Bin Saud). Halted at 2.45 p.m. by another solitary sugar-loaf hill rising out of t the broad depression. Direction due north,march ing in teeth of Shiraal (north wind) with fine cutting rain. Obliged to dismount -l rora camel and was so stiff could hardly walk. Walked last couple of miles into camp. Usual dreary Surnman scenery but valleys more open than on Koweit-Zil- fi route. Vegetation poor (no nussi) light Yellow sand. The sand on the Summan is different altogether from that on the nefudh which is ex tremely fine and pinkish in colour (in the dis tance orange). Thunder in West. The Arabs say about it that it means a seyl or flood at a distance of tw r o days. Xn one summer lightning like that is only 4 or 5 hours distant. T ahsin, the Imam’s man, told me today, apropos of ray having fever, that Bin Saud w r as a great doctor, I said how did he heal ? He said ”by siyasa: but it was a wonderful thing”.

Both ponies tucked-up from want of sufficient food, Arabs say they do not dream of taking horses across the country this „ime of year. Raining heavily at sundown. Still seedy my head going round; took quinine and Dover’s powder. At 11-15 we had passed Saluhhi tents on our left, close to a hill called Hasaniyah (fox-lands) or Ura-al Hassani, but otherwise saw no signs of Arabs. Mond a y 17th . Decem ber.
