There are two enclosures with Kemball's letter:1) The translated substance of a letter (ff 35-37) from the British Agent at Bahrain, Hajee Jassim, to Kemball, dated 3 June 1852, in which Jassim reports on a meeting with Sheikh Muhammed bin Khalifa, the Sheikh's receipt of Kemball's earlier letter, and his rejection of its contents. Jassim describes the Sheikh as being 'not of constant or faithful character'. Jassim continues that all is quiet in Bahrain, after a representative of the Guttur [Qatar] people came to settle matters with Sheikh Muhammed;2) The translated substance of a letter (f 38) from the British Agent at Bahrain, Hajee Jassim, to Kemball, dated 5 June 1852, in which Jassim reports that Sheikh Muhammed bin Khalifa has held council with his brother Sheikh Ali, the outcome of which he does not know. Sheikh Muhammed has no letter to be despatched to Kemball via Jassim at this point in time.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
