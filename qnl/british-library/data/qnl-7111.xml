Dear Hubljert; With reference to o\ir conversation hy telenhone today regarding the passport of a representative of the I. n .C., ^ho is visiting the ^ersian Culf, I write to confirm my statement that it is not considered desirable to give him a visa for the ^rucial Coast. '“’here is, however, no objection to his receiving a visa for Qatar. P. Since you tell me that he will be trying to obtain an oil concession in Qatar, it would be well to remind him that any dealings with the Arab Pulers of the Persian Gulf must be conducted through the British political authorities in the case of the Shaikh of Qatar, through the Political Resident at Buehlrc or the Political Agent at Bahrein.

The circumstances which have led up to this position are as follows: L9M.U0$ qf _c..a&amp;.i_^Qy . The Turkish Petroleum Company i now the Iraq Petroleum Company) was formed in 1912 when the Deutsche ^ank became associated with the National Sank of Turkey and the Anglo-C a xan ietroleum Company (Boyal huch-Chell group) in carder to press certain claims to oil rights in Baghdad and kosul, including those attached to the -dagh- -dad railway 0 ncession. The chief rival of the new company at that time was the Anglo*!ersian Oil Company which had for some time been in negotiation with the atikish Government* in 1914 an Agreement was entered into providing for the reconstitution ol the Turkish * etroleum Company, from which the lati.nal Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new participants being the Anglo- -Persian Oil Company, 50$; the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum and the Deutsche Bank 25r each* This Agreement also provided that the yree groups should give undertakings not to be interested directly or indirectly in the pro- -auction oi oil in the ottoman Empire in Europe and Asia except in Egypt, Kuwait or the Transferred Territories, except through the Turkish Petroleum Company* This Agreement was signed by the British and d 8rifian Governments and by the groups concerned. As the Turkish Petroleum Company was then predominantly British, this arrangement had the effect of securing the whole of this area to interests which were predominantly British. After the entry of**.entry of American and French interests into the Iraq Petroleum Company after the war, the arrangement as regards non-competition oetween the groups composing the Iraq Petroleum Company was continued in an agreement between the groups, entered into in i^SB. This was a private agreement between the groups with which the British Government was not concerned. Under this Agreement a line was drawn round Arabia, Palestine and Asia Minor, which excluded Kofceit and the Farsan ^alands, but included Bahrein aQp which dt fined an area-within which the various groups constituting the Iraq Petroleum Company agreed that they would not seek for or obtain oil concessions otherwise than thro|ugh toe x raq Petroleum Company or its nominee. The position as regards the distribution of capital in the Iraq Petroleum Company is as follows; In 1952 the American shareholding in the American Group was held in the following proportions: htaodard oil Company of New Jersey 41 % Standard Cil Company Company of Q Hew Pork 41 V$ % Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsyl- 9 Mania 16 A % As the xioyal hutch Ghell is 60, hutch and 40^ British, the hritish shareholding in the Iraq I eiroleum Company now only represents about The Iraq Petroleum^is technically a British Company, as in Article 32 of its Convention with the Government of Iraq, the Company must be and remain a British Company f registered in Great Britain, ana the ^hair- Angio-rersian oil Company Boyal hutch Shell French Group American Group U.S.Gulbenkian 23.75S -man must be at all times a British subject one'^Hhbprmh 5. One question wbleh arises is whether E.&amp;.Oav i cari ’° 6 expected to atrord the same measure of sup.; -jrt to the iraq Petroleum Company as it could in the oid &lt;uiys when it was a British Company in fact as well as in name. As the American oil Interests have large groups outside the Iraq i troleurn Company' as well as inside they are at an advantage and It may be neeess- -ery to support the irucq i etroleum Joapany as against ' a purely American concern.

Sir, A / ''' f I have the honour to forward the copy of a trans lation of a letter received from H.H. the Sultan on the above subject. The letter is self explanatory. 2. The financial condition of Muscat State is already known to you as is the policy of H.M.Government regarding the further development of oil resources. 3. It will therefore suffice to say that at a recent meeting with him the Sultan expressed his earnest desire for the survey to be carried out. I pointed out to him that neither the exploration carried out of the Anglo-Persian Gn Company nor the geological report of Dr. Lees led to much hope of petroleum being discovered, whilst the coal dis covered by Sir Percy Cox in the Sur hinterland was too remote to be a marketable proposition. 4® In spite of the discouragement offered His Highness was not to be deterred from the idea and requested that he might be permitted to make his own arrangements if Government were unable to put forward a company. I did not consider it desirable at this stage to urge that by treaty he is unable to grant concessions without the sanction of H.M.Government. 5.

He pointed out to His Highness that neither the exploration carried out by the Anglo~iersian Oil Company nor the geological information furnished by Lees (see paragraph 9 of Muscat Diary Ho.l of 1926) gave much hope of petroleum being discovered, whilst the coal discovered by Sir Percy Cox in the Sur hinterland was too far off to be a market able proposition. His Highness was not, however, deterred from the idea and requested thatlhe might be permitted to make his own arrangements if Government were unable to put forward a Company. The Political Agent did not think it advisable/ ■si 'ij■2' advisable at till© stage to remiisd His Highness that by treaty he was unable to grant concessions without the sanction of Hi© najesty*© Government. ' 1 3* He add© that His Highne©s , s desire for a Company other than the hnglo-xersiaa Oil Company to carry out the survey is prompted, he considers, more by a desire to have a second opinion from a fresh source than to exclude the Anglo~reraian oil Company. 4« The position at present is that His Highness the Sultan is bound by an undertaking, given in i.902, that he would not grant a concession for working the coal fields in the hinterland of 3ur to any foreign government or Company until an opportunity had been given to the 'British Government of undertaking the work in conjunction with the Sultan him self (Treaties, Sanads and engagements. Aitchlson. Volume XI, pages 283 and 318); and by an under taking, given in 1923, that he would not exploit, or give permission for exploiting, i petroleum in his territories without consulting the Political , Agent and without the approval of tlie 'Government of India (Treaties, Sanaa© and Engagements. Aitchison. Volume XI, pages 284 and 319) ♦ 5# In the winter of 1925-28 the Angloersian Oil Company carried out a preliminary exploration under the terms of the concession obtained by them in 1926(see Lieutenant- Colonel Crosthw&amp;ite 1 s despatch Ho*13 dated the 6th June 1925 to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, a copy of which was sent to the Government of India under Residency ? . • 9 }- endorsement Ho.190-S of the same date), but I do not know whether the Company were able to form any definite conclusions, and it is possible that they may still be interested in that *~3~ area. 6* It would be most unfortunate if American oil interests were to establish themselves in ’Oman* as in that case it would not be easy, in spite of the undertakings given by the Trucial Chiefs, to prevent tlieir absorbing the Trucial Coast and perhaps even ^atar. ?* I would suggest tlmt the Anglos er si an Oil Company should be sounded with a view to finding out whether they would be prepared to proceed with their exploration in ’Oman and, if successful, to exploit oil there* If tney are not 5 prepared to do so, I think that arery endeavour should be made to ensure that the exploration is carried out if possible by other British interests, with a view, in particular, to * preventing ‘Oman falling into the .hand© of the Standard Oil Company of California* E* I am sending a copy of this letter to the Foreign secretary to the Government of India* I have the honour to be, 5ir,rB/ Your moat obedient servant, sd.

MISCELLANEOUS . 9* Reference diary entry No.278 of 1925, Messrs Lees and Cray, geologists in the employ of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, or more correctly of the D’Arcy Exploration Com pany - the parent Company responsible for all exploration work, returned to Muscat from their two months travelling on the 26th December 1925. I attach a sketch map shov/ing the places visited by them, Mr. Lees informs me that they had a most successful expedition and were universally well treated by the Sheikhs and tribesmen. Captain Escless, Commanding the Muscat Infantry, accompanied the party and superintended all the social and political part of their travels, while Abdulla Williamson (an Englishman who has become Muslim and who is employed by the Anglo Persian u il company as a ”Sales Superintendent) assisted him and looked after the transport. Mr. Lees was naturally reticent on the subject of oil and I equally naturally did not question him. It would appear however that no indications of oil were found. No minerals were found except two worked out copper mines, whose existence even was not knov/n to the neighbouring villagers. Mr. Lees told me that the persons who had found the copper mines must have been very knowledgeable as the indications of copper were very meagre. There is a good deal of iron in the hills and the geologists found that this seriously affected their compasses if placed on the ground. It is an interesting fact that the geologists were invited by the Sheikhs of Baraimi to visit that tract, but the invitation was due to a hope that their presence would stop Isa bin Saleh cornong to Baraimi t as the latter was then successfully advancing up the Dhahira in the direction of Baraimi.Mr. Lees tells me that on two occasions shots were fired across the advance of their caravan by Bedouins, but when they made themselves known, the Bedouins were quite friendly. On one occasion Mr. Lees was on a hill collecting specimen rocks alone when a very uncouth shepherd began to throw stones at him. This nuisance being continually repeated, Mr. Lees charged the shepherd waving his geological hammer, whereat the shepherd fled. This was the only incident of the sort and this lonely shepherd had probably not heard of the arrival of the travellers andvGould not make out strange being had invaded his solitude. The party were accompanied by a botanist, a Mr. Fernandez of the Bombay Natural History Society. Mr. Lees appears to have been generously provided with presents for the Shaikhs and all concerned by his Company, and the expedition was a great success from the political” point of view. Messrs Lees and Gray left Muscat on the British India ^ail steamer on the 3rd instant for Bombay. There they join H.M.S.”Triad' which is proceeding to Dhofar to fetch His Highness the Sultan back to Muscat. The geologists will now explore Dhofar. The length of their stay there will depend on the character of the geological formations, and whether the same give hopes of oil. The country round Sur and Masira Island will be explored later if the tribesmen and Shaikhs are amenable.1 nn IALu Ho. C/200 of 1935.

I pointed out that one survey had been already made by the Anglo Persian Oil Company in 19^5 and the report of their geologists was that there were not sufficient indications of oil to warrant an exploration being carried out. As I expected the Oultan promptly mentioned what had happened at Bahrain and said that if the nglo Persian Oil Company h d been wrong in their estimation of the position at that place and another Company had come along and succeeded in finding oil, he saw no reason why the same thing should not happen in Musest. The Sultan is, I think, genuinely anxious that 4 .that another oil survey should be Bade in hie State.

There is a certain Captain Dewhurst of the British whom you may have come across yourself. This individual \ of a casual conversation Captain 9ewhurst told me that he had been talking to the Sultan about the possibility of finding oil in Muscat territory, according to Dewhurst the dultan declared that the ^nglo-Persian Oil Company had tried and failed to i inci oil in his iitate but that he would like some other Company to make another attempt. Oewhurst went on to say that he then informed the Sultan that he knew the very man man to act as a negotiator i.e. ka^or Prank Holmes, of Bahrain India Steam Navigation Compa ' Gulf Mail Steamer 'Barpeta* 1 - a somewhat The Hon»ble Lieut-Colonel T.C. Fowle, C.xj.b Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H i Band Kuwait fame, and that on the Sultan's return from dhofar he would arrange a meeting between Mm and His Highness. 1 gathered that the Sultan in a non committal way had replied that he would be pleased to meet Holmes. On hearing all this 1 said quietly and tactfully to Jewhurst that such matters were the exclusive concern of the British Political authori ties in the Gulf under the control of the Political resident. Dewhurst did not take my remark in very good part ana declared somewhat excitedly that he saw no reason why the Bui tan should not negotiate with whom he pleased in matters effecting his own State. I said 1 was not prepared to discuss the matter with him and shortly after broke off the conversation. 3m On one or two occasions previously this same Dewhurst has shown a tendency to criticise and mix himself in with Political arrangements in the Gulf but these were of a petty nature and 1 did not consider you would wish to be troubled with them. The present one is, however, on a different footing and I hope you will see your way to bring the matter to the notice of the British India Steam navigation Compan y 'a M anaging ..gents in Bomba; 5 ^nd have instructions given to Dewhurst to confine his activities in the Gulf to shipping and the legitimate interests of his company.CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to my conversation yesterday with Mr. J.C.Walton, at which I indicated that, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, my Company, Petroleum Concessions Limited, proposes to seek for oil concessions in the territory known as the Neutral Zone, the unallotted part of Bahrain Island, the Trucial Coast, and possibly along the Pirate Coast to Muscat. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. was registered as a private British Company on the 14th instant; the whole of its shares will be held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the Board will be of similar composition, excepting the appointment of an Iraqi Government Director. The concession recently obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Ltd. from the Ruler of Qatar will, at an appropriate time, be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Ltd., together with the Agreements relative thereto concluded with His Majesty’s Government; the provisions of these Agreements are generally acceptable to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in their application to oil concessions obtained over the above named territories wherein my Company recognises, and will respect, the existence of a special sphere of influence of His Majesty’s Gover nment • There will also be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. /Ltd, options for oil concessions recently obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Ltd. from the Rulers of Ras-al- Khrimah, Sharjah, Dubai and arjy other options obtained by that Company on our behalf in the Trucial Coast. The negotiations for the actual concessions will be undertaken by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and in that connection it is proposed to employ Major Prank Holmes, who is acquainted with Persian Gulf matters and who, to the best of my belief, can be entrusted to conduct such negotiations with proper observance of the customs of those countries. The terms to be offered will be based on the terms of the Q,atar concession with suitable adjustment of the cash payments in relation to the respective approximate areas of the concessions; the actual boundaries will be defined at a later stage as and when they are demarcated. The wishes of His Majesty's Government in regard to the employment of British subjects in these areas will be observed but I foresee possibly applying for special permission for the Company's Chief Geologist, Mr. N.E.Baker, an American citizen, to visit these areas to compile a report on their oil potentialities. The Company will comply with any instructions issued by the Resident or his representatives in regard to the movements, and for the protection of Geological reconnaissance parties. I shall be glad to hear whether these proposals are agreeable to His Majesty's Government and whether I may have permission to proceed on the above lines with the co-operation of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who will be kept informed of the negotiations.

My def-r Walton, ^ In reply to your letter 1.^.7763/35 dated 4th November 1935, enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr.Skliros about the proposed procedure for dealing with oil concessions in certain areas in the Persian Gulf, I write to say that the Admiralty are mainly concerned in the matter of safeguards. This question, although not at present urgent, is bound sooner or later to arise if oil is discovered. &lt;/e note that Mr. Skliros stated in his letter of the 24th October that the provisions of the Qatar Government Agreement would be generally acceptable to the new Company. As you know, this agreement (like that for Kuwait) deals with the question of a refinery in a somewhat unsatisfactory manner by a mere declaration of intention on the part of the Company to erect a refinery if commercial conditions justify it, and to examine the matter with H.M.Government when commercial production is assured. Every new concession granted in countries bordering the Persian Gulf accentuates the importance of the refinery question and it would be most unfortunate if the greater part of the territory were developed without any binding obligation on the part of the Company to build at least one refinery. We do not think that the relaxation of our requirements in this respect in the qatar and Kuwait concessions, in each case after long discussion with the companies , is a good reason for accepting the same position without further dis cussion in f ny future concessions. Ve feel, therefore, that new / ton,Esq. , C.B. ,M.O., India Office, S.W.l.new dreft concessions should contrin the approved standard refinery clause and that any relaxation should be agreed to only when good reasons are forthcoming, m do not suggest that there is any necessity to raise the matter in this form with the Company at the present stage but in view of Mr, Skliros* reference to the Qatar agreement we think it deeira hie that the Company should be reminded that the erection of a refinery or refineries in territory under British influence in the Persian Gulf is one of the prime desiderata of H.M. Government• Perhaps, therefore, you would be good enough to include such a reference in your reply. Apart from the foregoing we have no comments to offer on your proposed ret ion.

The questions raised have been under consideration in consultation with the other Departments of His Majesty's Government concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and I am now to inform you that the oposaIs are approved on the following conditions and understandings. 2, Bahrain . There is no objection to your Company applying to the Shaikh of Bahra in for a cone ess io&gt; , on the uno erstand ing that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests; these conditions would be embodied in a separate agreement between the Comp ny and Hie Majesty's Government. 3, Muscat .

We bad rather hoped at one period, in view of our special interests in the Persian Gulf, that an arrangement might have been come to within the Iraq Petroleum Company by which the .Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Shell Group might have been allowed to take up some of these concessions, p ,? * le of 'he new Company makes it clear that the French and American groups have not been willing to agree to this• While vie may from some points of view regret this decision, the new development has the advantage that we can, I think, now he sure that a Company with very substantial ®ri tish interests will he available to counter the quite I*C.Walton Esq.

But recent efforts to come to an arrangement have broken down. This, I think, may have the result of stimulating the action of the new Company in these Persian Gulf Areas. I am interested to see t'at Mr. Skliros is inclined to take up an option for the remainder of Bahrein. There may not be much left that is very valuable on the main island^ but per haps the shallow waters and other islands may be worth investigating. Subject to necessary safeguards such as you refer to in paragraph 7 of your letter, I think we should encourage the Company to go ahead with their plans. As regards paragraph 8, I was not present at the meeting of the Middle East Sub-Committee when the policy in regard to the Trucial Coafet was discussed hut I have since seen the record of the meeting and I think that here again, provided proper arrangements such as you suggest are made, we ought not to bar this territory from investigation^. I have already dealt above with the point you raise in paragraph 9. I agree with paragraphs 10 and 12 of your letter. In regard to paragraph 11, v;e do not much like the selection of Major Holmes as the Company’s Representative the for/negotiation of concessions. It will, however, have the advantage of putting an end to his activities on hehalf of less substantial and speculative concerns. This was an aspect of the situation which, no doubt, weighed with the Company in appointing him, but from that point of view we shall also benefit. And he is undoubtedlyundoubtedly experienced In conducting negotiations with the Sheikhs and Rulers of the territories concerned.

As I told you in my letter of the 23rd March, Resident ahout this. We now have their reply, in which they raise what appears to he an insuperable difficulty. The Sultan of Muscat, who was expected back in his capital in April, is now intending to spend several months longer in the interior of his State (in Dhofar), where he is inaccessible except by a prolonged desert journey or, in emergency, by R.A.F. aeroplanes. In these circumstances, it would be exceedingly ditficult for Major Holmes to get in touch with him, and it looks Major Holmes to start negotiations at Muscat, after liros Esq., troleum Concessions Ltd., City-Gate House, as/ Finsbury Square,2. as if any detailed negotiations will have to he left over till next season. In the meantime the Political Agent will explain the position generally to the Sultan hut without showing him a copy of the draft concession, and ascertain his reactions* 3. On the other hand, we have now heard from the Government of India and the Political Resident in reply to our telegram about the Trucial Coast proposals of your Company, and I am in a position to inform you that there will he no objection to negotiations being started with these rulers, on the basis of the draft concessions, subject to the following conditions and observations. (l) The Resident has by letters dated 9th March informed the 5 Sheikhs concerned that the options obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are approved, subject to the acceptance by the Sheikh of responsibility for the safety of any exploring party. When a reply is received from each Sheikh accepting this liability, Colonel Powle will again communicate with him, informing him that, with the approval of His Majesty r s Government, Petroleum Concessions Limited, in which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is a partner, will enter into negotiations under/4«/ \ A. fN iO ' ^ 3* xind.©!’ the option foT’ ■thp D'r» , Tn+ u xur -cne grant oi a concession. The way will then he open to Major Holmes. (2) Major Holmes will he required to keep in close touch with the Political Agent, Bahrein and keep him informed of the progress of the negotiations. (3) No concession can, of course, he finally concluded without the specific further approval of His Majesty s Government, who will require the Company to enter into a separate ''political” agreement with them* (4) it will he sufficient at this stage to define the boundaries of the concessions as those of the respective sheikhdoms without attempting to prepare maps. (5) As regards the protection of the Company ? s employees, in the event of a concession being obtained and operated, responsibility will fall on the Sheikh concerned. As a corollary of this, it is proposed to include in the ’'political” agreement a clause to the effect that any movements of employees entailing special risks (e.g. penetration for more than a certain distance away from the coast) should he subject to the prior written permission of the Sheikh.4. I shall he sending you a separate letter on the question of the 'Refinery clause'* 5* We shall now he talcing in hand the drafts of the 'political agreements' and will send you these in due course. Yours sincerely.P.Z. 1974/36. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 23rd March 1936. $9A as Dear Mr.Skliros, &amp; ,e k Many thanks for your letters of 18th and 20th March. As regards the Muscat draft concession, the proposals regarding the other drafts are at the moment under the consideration of the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. We are asking them hy telegraph to let us know their views on the Muscat proposal in advance of any further consideration which they may need to give to the other cases* We are sorry that it has not 'been possible to arrive at earlier decisions on all these proposals. Those in regard to Bahrein and Muscat presented comparatively little difficulty Tout it was necessary to give careful consideration to the proposals in regard to the Trucial Co a st, which were linked up with them m the programme of Major Holmes' negotiations contemplated m your letters of 30th January and 6th February. Yours, &lt;&amp;c., (Sgd.) J.C. WALTON. Skliros Esq.. , Petroleum Concessions Limited, City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E.C. 2.PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED. CITY-GATE HOUSE, FINSBURY SQUARE, LONDON, E.C, 2* 18th March 1936. Dear Mr.Walton, It is now nearly five months since I first addressed the India Office on the subject of the wish of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apply for concessions in the Persian Gulf, I realise that the Persian Gulf is a region which presents problems requiring special consideration from a number of different dei 3 artments. On the other hand, it is also a region where the working year has to be coBipressed into the eight months October to May, and there is some danger that if a decision is too long delayed, it will be impossible to start negotiations with any of the Rulers in that part of the world until next October, and so a whole season will be lost. On looking through the correspondence again I see that in your official letter P.Z. 8856/35 of the 12th December last you stated that there woula oe no objection to our applying for concessions to the Shaikh of Bahrain and to the Sultan of Muscat on the understanding that any concessions granted would be subject uo conditions which would be embodied in separate agreements between P.C.L. and H.M’s. Government. And in your J /J d.o. P. Z.9314/35, dated the 14th January, to Lefroy you referred to the anxiety of the Sultan of Muscat to have a thorough oil survey carried out in his State, and c. Walton Esq., G.3., M.C., enquired/ India Office, Whitehall* S.W.l.enquired if the A.I.O.C. or P.C.L. were intending to open negotiations with the Sultan in the near future. In my letter of the 30th January I have given an undertaking on behalf of P.C.L. to accept in respect of all the proposed concessions conditions similar to those accepted by the A.I.O.C. in respect of Qatar, with the sole reservation that P.C.L. should not be required to erect a separate refinery in each of the areas over which it may obtain a concession. The points raised in your letter P.Z.759/36* dated the 4th February affect neither Bahrain nor Muscat. In the circumstances if I could have an early decision not only in respect of Bahrain (as promised in your letter of the 5th March), but also in respect of Muscat, I could telegraph to Major Holmes and tell him to negotiate a concession with the Shaikh of Bahrain, and thereafter proceed to Muscat to fix up the Muscat concession, and then proceed to Aden to consult Colonel Lake with a view to negotiating a concession with the Imam of Yemen. That would leave Kuwait and the Trucial Coast areas to be dealt with next season, but would at least ensure that the present season would not have been altogether wasted. I should add that the option obtained by the A.I.O.C. over Ras-al-Khaimah expires on the 31st July 1937, and that over Dubai on the 18th October 1937, so we shall find ourselves with only one working season in which to send geological survey parties to these areas and to negotiate long-term concessions, but I suppose that that cannot be helped.

My dear Andrew, Your letter No.309/81/5 of the 12 th February on oil development question in the Gulf. I will take your three questions seriatim. (i) The Iraq Petroleum Company (or, as it 'was then known, the Turkish Petroleum Company) Group Agreement of 1928 - known as the ft Red Line Agreement” - as you know drew a red line round Arabia and Asia Minor but left out Kuwait and the Farsan Islands. Bahrain was included within the area. In regard to Kuwait in particular the definitions appended to the map which accompanied trie agreement state that the red line is intended to follow w the limit of the territorial waters of the Arabian Peninsula excepting trie Sultanate of Kuwait and the Farsan Islands Archipelago”. As the Neutral Zone had already been constituted when this Agreement was entered into, it was assumed by the Iraq Petroleum Company - an assumption that has not been disputed - triat the Neutral Zone is not, in so far as the Red Line Agreement is concerned, part of the 'Sultanate of Kuwait', and therefore lies with in the area covered by that Agreement* This is the accepted view. (ii) The D* Arcy Exploration Company Limited is a subsidiary company of the Anglo-Iranian Oil /f Oil Company. It has a small nominal capital, fully owned by the latter company. I understand that the subsidiary company usually does all the preliminary negotiations as regards options and concessions, but any subsequent exploitation is entrusted to the parent company - i.e* the Anglo-Iranian w 'il Company, which in turn under the bed Line Agreement must offer to the Iraq Petroleum. Company any concessions it may acquire within the red line area. (iii) With regard to Oil in Muscat, the Sultan undertook by an agreement with us of February 192$ nc to exploit any oil which might be found in his territories or to grant permission for its exploita tion without prior consultation with the Political the Qatar frontier that Philby might, if he wanted matter of frontier delimitation* ine only other territories marching with Saudi Arabia axe Abu Dhabi and Muscat, and there seems no great prospect of oil being looked for at any distance from the Agent and the approval of the Government of India. 2. As to Pnilby 1 s article in the Egyptian Gazette of the 14th January; there does not seem much harm in it though there is a slight sting in its In tail. S&amp;s actual fact it is only in connexion with to, charge us with any ulterior motives in the coastal belt.CONFIDENTIAL. POLITICAL CENOY AN 0 No. J&gt; 25 -S 0 f 1936.

Major Longrigg said that Major Holmes was undoubtedly on very close friendly terms with the Shaikh, but of course the latter was not completely under his thumb, Mr.Skliros also mentioned a story told him by Ydlibi to the effect that Ibn Baud had received £50,000 from the Califomia-Arabian Oil Company for the option given to them by him for his share in the Neutral Zone, and would be willing, for £1,000 from P.E.Lo,to return that £50,000 to the American Company, get clear of his option and do business with PeC,L. Both he and Major Longrigg thought this a very unlikely story, 3. Mr, Bkliros then said that he had had some sort of idea at the back of his mind that there might have been a possi bility of the ownership o^ the Neutral Zone passing in toto to one or o+her of fliese rulers. Mr.Rendel explained briefly the reasons which gave rise to the Neutral Zone, i*e, arising out of tribal arrangements in that region, and said that there was no likelihood of any such development as suggested 'by Mr* Bkliros o 4o As regards the Trucial Shaikhs, matters were rather hanging fire, and so far Major Holmes had not been able to conclude /conclude anvthingo He (Mro^kliron) was no+ too optiMiettc aHout these J^halkhdoms« 5« As regards Muscat, the Sultan was still avmy in ^ho^ar, and so far Major Koines had not 'been able to establish contact ydth hin 0 60 finally Mr, Hkliros said that ^ith regard to their intentions in the Yemen,nothing had of course vet been done, but Major Koines had -written a very nice letter to the Imam recalling himself to the latter’s recollection, and generally paving the vjay towards further steps in 'hat dire ct ion, (sgdo) Y e Brenan, FOREIGN OFFICE,3„W .1 6 th JUNE,1936*By Air Mail.

Dear Glauson, JT V In reply to your letter of the 6th July(P.Z.4606/56) , we agree that in the event of Petroleum Concessions Limited securing concessions in Bahrein, or on the 'Crucial Coast, the Company should subscribe to political agreements on the lines of the Qatar Agreement amended as suggested in your express letter of the 3rd April (P.2.2078/36), with the further amendment mentioned below and (in the Trucial Agreements) with the addition of an article regarding the boundaries inter se of the Sheikhdoms, on the lines suggested in the enclosure to your express letter of the 20th May. The Qatar Agreement included the usual provisions relating inter alia, to the registration in Great Britain of any transferee or subsidiary company, but had no similar provisions in respect of the parent company itself. This was not necessary when we were dealing with a company like the Anglo-Persian, but it would seem desirable to deal with it in the case of Petroleum Concessions Limited, otherwise one of the main objects of the political agreement might be defeated. 1 would, therefore, suggest inserting the words 'Petroleum Concessions Limited and” at the beginning of paragraph 2 (as already amended) of the Qatar Agreement before the words n any subsidiary Company shall be and remain a British Company registered in Great Britain, etc.'. If this were done, I think it would be better to reverse the order of paragraphs 1 and 2, and so refer first of all to the parent company and any subsidiary company, and then deal with any transfoiee company. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Brenan, ceal and Pirie.

To Brltconsul, Bushir No. Z/^ Dated 11th October 1956. Reference my telegram Ho*25/44 dated 8 th October, for your information I give herewith a resume of the Sultan*s reactions to the information X gave him at Dhofur in April regarding the proposed negotiations for oil which Petroleum Concessions Ltd, desire to carry out with him, fc. The Sultan declared at once that he was quite willing to start negotiations with the Company on his return to Tuscat which he said would probably be in October, (However recent information received points to it being doubtful if he will be back before December). I pointed out that the concession would probably be so drawn as to cover the whole of the State including Oman, The Sultan replied that of course Oman was for such purposes entirely out of his control but that for the rest of his territory he could, he felt confident, make all nece^ary ai'rangements for exploitation^ and for the sal ety of personnel of the Oil Company. I specially asked His Highness whether he thought the Bin Hu All would be likely to cause trouble in the 8 ur district. The Sultan declared with feeling and bitterness tnat the Bani Bu Ali were the greediest and most grasping tribe in the whole of his State and though they could, he said, most probably be Induced to keep quiet and reirain from interference with prospecting parties and any operations which might be carried out subsequently in their territory, they would have to be heavily bribed.i •^ ie &amp;u -^ tan became emotional when tailing about the Bani Lu All and their (in his opinion) mercenary disposition* He considers and I think no doubt quite rightly for the right to prospect and exploit oil in his dominions, a substantial portion^ would have to be given to this notorious tribe if the concession is to include their territory. of course correct* In my opinion the Imam would never come to an agreement with the Sultan toallow any foreign Company to prospect fordl within his boundaries. I think that he might be willing to n gotlate ior such a purpose through British Official channel.* so long as the Muscat Government were left outside* To such action there would no d ubt be objections as it would probably lead to complications. that whatever sum he may receive from Petroleum Concessions Ltd 4 That the sultan said as regards the Oman is n olit leal.R? r/o- 2/47 v:l.(o^J+ i»36 Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

He knows perfectly well he has undertaken to consult us before giving an oil concession to any Company ( On my last visit by air to Dhofar in April last year this point cropped up in the course of conversation and the Sultan admitted his obligation) and these secret negotiations with the Standard Oil Company behind our backs are of course directly at variance with the spirit if not the actual letter of his undertaking to His Majesty’s Government, It seems that this matter is another one on which the Sultan requires some straight speaking. On my last visit to Dhofar in November the Sultan asked me how the position stood as regards the question of oil exploitation in his State. I replied that we were merely awaiting his return to his Capital when a Representative of Petroleum Concessions Limited would shortly visit him and commence^ preliminary negotiations. The Sultan then asked why the Bahrain Petroleum Company could not be approached in the matter.

Mr.Eallantyne called urgently on January 26th to say that tne Company (Standard Oil) had received from the Sultan of Muscat samples of oil seepages in Muscat for their consideration. The samples were sent to Bahrein and from, there to Hasa for examination by the Calarabian people. Mr.Ballantyne emphasises that so far as he was aware the initiative in this case had come from the Sultan. The Company, before taking any decision as to the line which they would take as a, result of being given this opening by the Sultan, felt that they had better report the matter to H.M.G. and ask whether H.M.C. had any views tc expr ess. 1 said that so far as I knew this was the first we had heard of the Sultan’s action. I could not say what H.M.G. * s views would be but promised him an early answer. I added that we had had some correspondence both with Petroleum Concessions Limited and with the Sultan about an oil concession for the former but I did not remember offhand how deeply we were committed to that Company in respect of this area. Mr. Ballantyne telephoned on the 27th to ask if he could, have an answer. I told him that I had submitted the matter for instructions here and that it was desired to consult the various authorities concerned before giving the Company H.M.G.’s considered views. He said the Company were in rather a hurry and probably feared the possibility of others getting in ahead of them. I explained that another/another Company was already in the field and had been for a considerable time, so that no question of that sort could arise. Mr.Ballantyne hinted that the Company might have desired to send nr .Kamil t on (who is at present in Bahrein) round to Muscat to see the Sultan, or alternatively to wait tnere until permission was received from His Majesty’s Government for him to see the Sultan. Would H.M.G. be likeIp to ooject to that, if e.g. Mr.Hamilton applied for a visa ? I said j. thought it would probably be premature to consider such a trip. The first step in any case would probably have to be taken through the Political Agent and not by direct contact between the Company and the Sultan. But I had no authority to give him an answer to this hypothetical question. . If Mr.Hamilton applied for a visa locally the authorities would no doubt refer the matter and that question could be settled in conjunction with the larger question. I suggested that it might be wise for the Company to wait for H.M.G.’s views, as they had asked for them, before doing any more. That, however, was for the Company to decide There was of course no guarantee that H.M.G.’s reply, when made, would be satisfactory from the Company’s point of view. Mr.Ballantyne said he quite understood the position. a ia Office, 29th January 1937telegram - Q. ? ' I From - Secretary of State for India. To - Political Muscat. No.481. Dated 10 &gt; -2-19S7.

It will be necessary to discuss whole question with Sultan on his return to his capital next month. Present position is that Petroleum Concessions Ltd apalied over a year ago for permission to negotiate with Sultan permission was granted and Political Agent put matter, to Sultan who agreed to negotiate. Lack of further progress has been due to Sultan-s absence from the capital in these circumstances His Majesty's Government regard Petroleum Concessions Ltd as definitely having priority and could not approve rival Company, entering field at this stage.Telegram - Q.

MUSCAT OIL. I spoke to Mr. Ball ant yne to-day and made to him, on 'behalf of His Majesty’s Government, a statement in the terms contained in paragraph 2 of India Office telegram of the 10th February to Bushire, No.lfSl. Mr. Ballantyne noted this statement. He said that obviously the Company’s first reaction would be to ask, with reference to the last sentence of the statement, when the Company woul d be allowed to enter the field. He recognised, however, that it was impossible for His Majesty’s Government to give any answer at this stage to such a question, and that, broadly speaking. His Majesty’s Government desired thQ which had. been in the field for a year and through no fault of its own had been unable to make any substantial progress, to have a fair run for its money before any other Company was admitted. He said tnat no might have to raise the matter again at a later date, buu for the present he thought the Company would be quite satisfied with the statement. Incidentally I gathered from Mr. Ballantyne that tne Company 1 s'analysis of the samples sent to them by the Sultan of Muscat has been negative, so that tuey may not in any case be very interested in a Muscat concession. Mr. Ballantyne said that he presumed that His Majesty s Government would not see any objection to the Company sending to the Sultan the analysis for which he had asked them. ■ It would be exceedingly discourteous for them not todo so. I said that- I did not see how there could he any possible objection and that I did not think it would be necessary to attach any conditions, e.g. that the reply snould be sent tnrough the Political Agent, in view of* the Pact ohac the reply would be purely scientiPic, and that the Company clearly understood that no cormmmication could be made to the Sultan in regard to any qucotion oP negotiations, except through the medium oP the Political Agent and with His Majesty’s Government’s consent.I v .4, rank holmes KUWAIT, Arabia, ( PERSIAN GULF ) Telegram: 'HOLllffiS” SHARJAH fs) at / Dubai, 27th,February 1937.

The Leased Area. Chie is quite different from the earlier draft. The last sentence of this article might be deleted and the words * of Oman** added after 'Muscat”* (3) . Article 1(b) .

Major Holmes’ draft is from date of signature of the Agreement. This is also a commercial matter* (11) # Article 23 * In the earlier draft the subsidiary of the Company is called 'Petroleum Concession (Oman) limited.* In Major Holraes’ draft it is called 'Petroleum ( evelopment) True ial Coast Limited*. This my be an oversight, but Company may be asked to elucidate* (12) * Article 27, Bank. Che second sub-paragraph, requiring the dultan to consult the Company, is not in the earlier draft. It is not clear why the Company should be consulted on this point, regarding which the Sultan should rather obtain tne views of His Majesty’s Government.

My dear Rendel, ^e have read with interest the papers sent over under cover oi your printed letters E.6646/260/91 of the 22nd October, and 1.6686/260/91 of the 30th October on the subject of the desire of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. to obtain an option in the Rubi-al-Khali. ye note from your despatch to Jedda No.311 of the 29th October that you feel that Petroleum Concessions Ltd., have been forestalled by the Standard Oil Company cf California as regaras any territory in the Rubi-al Khali under Ibn Saud suzerainty; also that you feel that this development constitutes a further reason for making a new effort to reach a rapid settlement of the frontier question. Whilst the former proposition seems to be correct we feel that the second is more doubtful and that an alternative policy might be to act on the assumption that all the area in the desert lying beyond the line we have offered to Ibn Saud is 'res nuilius' to which our Arab clients have as much right (if not more) to raise a claim as Ibn Saud himself. It might be possible, therefore, to settle the frontier question unilaterally by permitting the trucial sheikhs and the Sultan of Muscat to grant concessions to the Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., up to the limit we are prepared to offer to Ibn Saud. We feel that now oil has become more of a definite proposition in the desert, Ibn Saud is all the Mendel, Esq., more/ foreign Office, S.W.lmore likely to open his mouth widely in connection with the frontier settlement; and he is certainly not likely to be more moderate in his demands if we again show anxiety to press on with a settlement. On the other hand, we think there can be no doubt after the very full consideration which was given to the whole question a year or so ago, that the area we were prepared to oiler Ibn Saud was of generous extent, and included all the desert to which he could reasonably be regarded as having set up a prescriptive title. If, oherefore, he took us to arbitration after the concessions had been granted he would probaoly have a bad casej and we suggest in fact that he is not likely to do so. 1 am sending copies of this letter to Clauson, Baxter, Gunn, and pirie.

My dear Seal, 1 am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter No. M.04987/36 of December 7th about oil concessions in the RutMal Ehali and the question of south eastern Arabian frontiers. We shall shortly be sending you officially a copy of Bullard^ despatch No. 306 of November 23rd in which he discusses this question and incidentally deprecates the idea of any attempt to adopt a unilaterally defined frontier for the Aden Protectorate by allowing Petroleum Concessions Ltd. to get a concession up to the frontier we offered Ibn Baud in November 1935. He realises, however, that the matter cannot be held up indefinitely. Bullard promises a further despatch after an interview which he was about to have with Fuad Bey Hamza, and until this further despatch is received, I do not think any decision on our part is called for. But I think it is clear that we shall have to consider the whole question interdepartmenually in the fairly near future.

In addition, we are hoping to obtain an Option or Concession from the Sultan of Muscat very shortly. Our experience with geological reconnaissance in this part of the world to date has shown that the lack of water, the lack, of roads, and the difficulty in obtaining supplies makes progress extremely slow. In other parts of the world it has been found that an aerial survey can often give more useful results than reconnaissance on the ground, and that such results aie obtained in a tithe of the time. We would therefore like to investigate the possibility of arranging aerial transport for our geological parties working in these areas. Purthermor e, our ir i ends, the Anglo—xi auian Oil Company, have we understand, made arrangements roi an aerial survey to be carried out for them tins Spring In Southern Persia by Aer©films Ltd., a well-ioiown linn which specialises in work of this description.

Hd h )l 1 » Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.|p. Z. 2498/37. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 26th April, 1937. Dear Brenan, Will you kindly refer to the letter from Petroleum ; Concessions Limited dated 24th March, a copy of which was sent to you under P. 2 . 2008/37 on the 3rd April, regarding tide Company’s desire to use aeroplanes for transport and air survey in Qatar, the Trucial Coast states and Muscat. In our telegram of the 8 th April we asked the Political Pesident for his views on the Company’s proposal, and I now enclose a copy of his / reply dated 14th April. The position under the various concessions (or draft Concessions) is as follows:~ ( a ) Article 3 of the Commercial Concession, the Company H shall explore the State of Qatar minutely by any method which is best in its opinion ' Under Article 10 it is entitled to import aeroplanes free of duty. Under Article 6 it ’’has the right to use all the means of transport required for its operations in I. V. Brenan, Esq., 0. B. E. , Foreign Office, S, W. 1. accordance/2 . accordance with this agreement, excepting aerial transport, which, on every occasion arising for it the Company must obtain the Sheikh’s permission and consent thereto”. Under article 6 of the Political agreement any right given by the Company under the Commercial agreement to utilise means of transportation by air is made subject to any general regulations for civil aircraft made by the Sheikh on the advice of His Majesty’s Government. (There are as yet no Qatar Air Regulations). Under Article 5 the Company gives a general undertaking at all times to pay due deference to the advice of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (b) Truclal Coast States . Under Article 9 of the draft Debai Commercial Agreement (which of course is a common form agreement for the Trueial States as a whole and is about to be signed) the Company has the right to import aircraft free of duty. Under Article 11 the Company has the right to construct, maintain and operate•aircraft and buildings and landing places for aircraft. It may also instal and operate without hindrance all such means of transportation by land, air and water as are necessary for its operations under the Concession. Under Article 6 of the Political Agreement any right given to the Company by the Commercial Concession to utilise means of transportation by air, is made/3. made subject to any general regulations for civil aircraft made by the Sheikh on the advice of His Majesty’s Government (there are as yet no Air Regulations for any Trucial Coast btate ' 1 ’ .gig t0 a n,y instructions whic h may be issued bv the Political Resident in the Persian dint There is also in Article 5 the general undertaking to pay due deference to the advice of the Political Resident and his subordinates. (c) Muscat. The present idea is that any Muscat Commercial concession if and when obtained and Political Agreement would be on the same lines as those in regard to the Trucial Coast States. 3. It is clear, therefore, that so far as aerial is concerned, the Company has, or will have, the necessary rights under the Commercial concessions. In the case of Qatar the necessity for the previous consent of the Sheikh is clearly laid down, as Colonel Fowle points out in his telegram, while in the Trucial Coast draft concessions, the previous consent of the Sheikh is not specifically required; but the Company would perhaps consult the Sheikh concerned beforehand in any case. As regards aerial survey, there does not appear to be any specific provision in the Commercial Agreement, but presumably it may be taken that ‘’transportation’ 1 includes survey. 4, The position under the Political Agreements is that in/■to /K 4&lt; | in regard to Qatar His Majesty’s Government have an indirect control over the Company’s actions in this matter, while on the Trucial Coast (and in Muscat) they will have the specific right to issue instructions through the Political Resident. 5. We now come to the question of the precise answer which should he given to the Company. As you v/ill see, the Resident does not appear to see any objection in principle to the use of aircraft for transjjort or survey by the Company, hut while he would allow it at this stage in Qatar, he is inclined to think that it is too soon for the Company to consider using aeroplanes on the Trucial Coast or in Muscat, 6 , On the question of principle there does not seem to he any reason why we should dissent from the Resident’s view* We are, of course, concerned to avoid any development of private flying on the Arab Coast, and we are also indirectly concerned with the security of the Company’s operations and employees. On the first point there is obviously a clear distinction between private flying as such, and the use of aeroplanes by a Company holding a concession from the Ruler in question. Moreover, we have already agreed that the Kuwait/a Kuwait Oil Company may use aeroplanes for its operations. On the second point, there is no reason to suppose that the Company's employees would he running any more risk hy flying than they would hy going about on land. In fact I suppose it is probably the case that flying would actually be safer than going about by land, m the case of survey, particularly, the fact that the aeroplanes v/ould do the job m such a very much shorter time than a land survey is, no doubt, an argument in their favour from the security point of view. it might, however, be a good plan, if the Air Ministry agree, that we should tell the Resident to consult with the local air authorities as to the suitabilitj of the aircraft and other equipment which the Company may intend to use, and to make sure that any aeroplanes to be employed conform with the Bahrein Civil Air Regulations as regards airworthiness etc. 7. We would accordingly propose, if the other Departments agree, to inform the Company that His Majesty’s Government see no objection in principle to the use of aircraft for transport or survey, provided that (a) tne consent of the Sheikh concerned is obtained beforehand and the area over which the Company would propose to/(bj that the Resident or the Political Agent is kept m close touch with the Company's plans and is consulted as to the suitability of the aircraft and equipment (e.g. wireleos;, which should in any case conform with the regulations regarding airworthiness etc. which apply in Bahrein (or Muscat). 1 8 . As regards the specific proposals of the Company, we would propose to Inform them that they may go ahead as soon as they like with the Sheikh of Qatar (approaching him through the local political authorities in the first place), hut that they should take steps to ensure that the aeroplanes will not operate in any area further south than the Resident or Political Agent feel to he safe, in view of the claims of Ibn Saud to some of the territory in this area. We would, however, suggest to them that they should not for the present take any steps in regard to the Trucial Coast or a fortiori in regard to Muscat, for the reasons which Colonel Fowle gives. 9. As the Company asked us on March 24th for an early reply we should be most grateful if you would kindly let us have an answer as soon as possible.t .1 \ v COroi 33E HTIAL, ECOR D ir r, &gt;7 If No.c/149 of 1937.

Dear Clauson, Thank you for your letter P.E. 2498/37 of the 26th April regarding an application 'by Petroleum Concessions Limited uo employ a civilian firm to undertake air surveys o~ their concessions in gatar, on the Trucial coast and in I Muscat and to use air transport in these areas. I We agree with your view that while it is II. M. Government’s policy to avoid the development of civil flying in the areas under review, there appears to he a considerable difference between the use of aeroplanes by a company of this nature, whose air activities would be entirely local and to some extent controlled by the Resident or his representatives in the Persian Gulf - and private flying as such by individuals. We also agree that there appears to be no objection in principle to Petroleum Concessions Limited operating aircraft in Qatar, subject to the provisos contained in paragraphs 7 and 8 of your letter, and provided the air survey company to be employed is a British firm of undoubted repute, entirely under British direction, and employing only British nationals or natives of Qatar. We are hov/ever telegraphing to the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, to ascertain his views on these proposals from the vie?/ point of defence. In vie?/ of Powle’s remarks at paragraphs 2 and 3 of his signal Ho.T/ 38 of the 14th April, presumably you will not agree to the use of aircraft on the Trucial Coast or in . .uscat, at least for the present, and we consider this is the best course to adopt in the circumstances.
