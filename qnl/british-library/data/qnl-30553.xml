In accordance with your verbal request, I have the honour to inform you that the 3 pdr.Hotchkiss guns belonging to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat have been inspected and various positions where two of these might be mounted nav baan examined. All guns were in good condition. 2. A superficial examination of the Portuguese Fort carried out. As far as can be seen, the general stonework is in fairly good condition with the exception of the tov^-s are all in a very bad state of repair, and their condition could on iy be remedied at excessive cost} the idea of raountin- guns in them therefore h&amp;e been disc termed e 3 . The site of the right hand tower, marked 'A' in the attached sketch, gives a very good position for a gun, as it commands the three roads adequately as well as the narbour ana sea entrance. If the tower were levelled down to the rock, a very satisfactory gun position could be rasde by embedding a steel plate inches thick, and about three feet square under neath a bed of concrete twelve inches thick with the holding down bolts for the gunmounting passing through the plate and concrete» 4. Another suitable position for a gun is on the sue marked 'B', which would require a certain amount of reinforcing in the gallery underneath in order to mount the gun sec n ely a. suggested. The efficacy of this position would be improved if the round tower with the flag on it were rutioved. 5 . It is considered that two guns mounted in the positions described above would efficiently cover approaches to &amp;ffiiBcat from the land and eea#TELE ^ R T '.

There would be difficulty in promising him a guarantee against internal disturbances but we could offer to p*ive him such assistance as may be po ssib le.

T )|rt&gt; Your telegram 1079''June the 22nd. 2* The first point to be considered is whether any useful objective is to be gained by giving Sultan guarantee he desires. As Fowle remarks, Sultan could not and would not offer armed resistance to any use of his territory which we might hate to make and if he remains neutral, it is unlikely to give assistance to our enemies* 3. His Majesty's Government have better information at their disposal regarding the value of installations at Muscat to Imperial defence and the defence of the Gulf and are therefore in a better position to gauge the desirability of giving the Sultan a guarantee against aggression. The Government of India are concerned not only on account of tte presence of a number of Indian traders in ^uscat, buu also because they consider that if no assistance were gi\en to the Sultan of Muscat in such circumstances, the confidence of the other .Arab Rulers in the Gulf would be severely shaken and the interests of the Government of India would as a result suffer equally with those of His Majesty's Government* 4. It seems that such a guarantee could be given if arrangements were made for a oattaiion to be despa^aea to Muscat when a threat against it arises, yi.dg. the recommendation contained in paragraph 23 of Major Price s Defence Scheme for Muscat. The possibility of sending ^ vcfj ♦ V hoops2 8. .... troops from India is, however, governed by Gomnent (b) in the note from the General Staff India forwarded under our Express letter No. D. 2016-N/39 dated the 11th July 1939. 5. It would not in any case be reasonable to accept an indefinite post-hostilities commitment, but it is inconceivable that any military detachment in Muscat would be withdrawn while there remained a positive threat to security. 6. The alternative to a guarantee suggested by Fowle in paragraph 5(8) of his Express letter No. 419-S of the 28th 4pril 1939 is the offer of a subsidy. It is considered that it should first be decided whether circumstances are such as to justify the giving of a guarantee with its implication of military assistance. If it is decided that such a guarantee is not justifiable, then a subsidy might be offered. It should be subject to the proviso that the Sultan increases his levies and improves his defensive measures generally and should be limited to the figure originally suggested by Fowle viz . Hs. 10,000/- a month. Incidence of expenditure would be decided in accordance with any decision reached regarding division of war time expenditure in this region generally between His Majesty’s Government and Government of India. 7. It seems desirable to bargain with Sultan now and not wait till outbreak of war when there will be so mucip else to be done. It is impossible, however, for any action to be taken till His Majesty’s Government have reached a decision on the subject of a guarantee with its implication of the despatch of a battalion to Muscat should necessity arise. It is accordingly requested that a decision on this point may be coomuni- cated as soon as possible.8* In the reply to your ixprasa letter No* P*2*2692/39, of the 19tn May 1939 wnich we hope anortly to be sending to you, we propose to recouimena that His Majesty^ Oovernment snould present to the Sultan the arms and equipment mentioned in paragraph 19 of the muscat Defence Scheme Gf. paragraph 6(5) of Fowle’a Express letter No* 419-S of April 28th. He consider it desirable that this should be done whether any bargain is struck with Sultan or not. We have further agreed by telegram to provide a British officer and N.G.O. for the proposed local defence xh scheme at Bahrain, and we understand that their duties would include advice to all rulers in tiie Gulf on the training of local forces* 9.

Lear Tod, Would you refer t e telegram from the Political Resident, Eo.T/172 of the 14th August, copies of which were distributed with India Office letter of the 15th August No.P.Z.4954/39, in which he discusses two suggestions put forward by the Sultan of Muscat with a view to securing his position in the event of war. 2. As regards the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should maintain a large reserve of ammunition f at Muscat to be under the control of the Political Agent j 1 and only used in a grave emergency by the Sultan’s forces, this is primarily, as Fowle says, a matter for the service Departments and we should be grateful for any ^eminents wnic the War Office may have to offer upon it 3. In regard to the Sultan’s second suggestion, the position is that the recommendations in paragraph 19 of the Muscat Defence Scheme for the presentation to the Sultan 'ey His Majesty’s Government of a quantity of arms and His Maj esty’s or G.F.Tod, (M .1.2.a) , War Office.2 . ammunition were endorsed by the Oversea Defence Committee at their meeting of 12th June, which recommended that the Air Ministry should take the necessary action. The Government of India and Fowle are aware that the Gulf Defence schemes have been generally endorsed oy the Committee but they have not been specifically informed that the grant of arms and ammunition to the Sultan has been approved by His Majesty’s Government. We would now propose to tell them this, if you concur, and it would also be helpful if we could give them some indication when the supply of the arms and ammunition in question may be anticipated. We would be grateful for an early reply on this matter. 4. When we are in possession of your observations these points, we shall then be in a better position to consider further the wider question raised by ?owle at the end of his telegram as to the attitude of the Sultan in the event of war. 5 .

Do you refer only to men belonging to the Arab tribes in or near Oman, or do you include Arabs who have a strong strain of negro blood ? 3. I have little experience of Muscat but I should have thought that the tribal type of Arab would tend to be untrustworthy and the trouble with the Yemen Infantry showed that they are not always easy to handle. On the other negroes, if of the right type, whether pure or with a alight dash of Arab blood, are both courageous and faithful, and the Amirs of the mainland rely very largely on them for their bodyguards. We replaced the Punjabis in the Bahrain Armed Police with men of this type seven or eight years ago and Belgrave tells me they are very pleased with the result. 4. Now that the pearling industry is at a low ebb, such men would be forthcoming at reasonable rates of pay and t we can reopen the question might prove a useful stop-gap unti of Indian Reservists. , Tp t me have your views on this Would you very kindly let me j point• ?tain T.

By 'Arab” material I meant pure blooded Arabs from the tribes in and near Oman. The enlistment of negroes not occurred to me. 3. You mention the Yemen Infantry. They were, you will recollect, disbanded some little time after the Perim murder. I do not think they were any more untrustworthy than the Indian Army regiments who have had the misfortune to have a murder committed. They were not nearly as good an they might have been and this was due in part to the poor class of Yemeni and Protectorate Arab enlisted and in part to the over kindness of their commanding officer. The present Aden Protectorate Levies are a very fine body of men. They are all from the Protectorate and must be certified by the Political Secretary to be of 'tribesman' standing before they are eligible for enlistment. They are all of one Sect of Islam being Shaffai. They had until recently an excellent Commanding Officer and of course have British 0££i£££S.' 4. I have always looked on the Negro as a servant / and I have The Hon’ble Major C.G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain2 and I have no doubt he makes an excellent and faithful servant but I have never considered him in the category of a soldier. The Bahrain experiment has been a success, I believe, and as far as guard duties were concerned they were certainly smart. They also did well in one or two little affrays with intoxicated Americans, but X do not know how they would train to work auto matic weapons and think for themselves. Nor do I know what if any political reaction there would be in the Interior. The Sultan has a source of supply in Dhoffar and if he did enlist them in his Levy he might prefer his own people. Arrangements would have to be made for their women folk or else they would soon be on the sick list if one may judge by the example of the Sultan's own Negro body-guard. One could rely on their personal courage and they would certainly be an improvement on the present type of Levy. I will discuss the question privately with the Sultan as soon as I have an opportunity and will let you know his views.By Air Mail.

His Majesty*s Government in consultation with the Government of India have considered the Sultan*s statement of conditions on which he is prepared to afford them necessary facilities in his territories and territorial waters during the present war. They wish in the first place to reaffirm their readiness to protect his territories including Gwadur from any external agression resulting from the war, in t5ie event internal disturbances they are prepared to give him such assistance as may be possible. In reply to his specific requests they desire to return for Sultan* i co-operation. fa), Yhey agree that the Sultan should be a par^y to any peace treaty to the extent that it may involve Muscat territory or Muscat interests. (h). They understand that unless specific permission is / given bygiven by the Sultan any facilities that might be desired during war (i.e. apart from those which the Sultan had already granted in peace time) will terminate on the conclusion of peace. (c) . They undertake to consult the Sultan on all political matters relating to his' territory and to obtain his permission before entering into direct communication with tribal leaders of Oman. (d) . Special consideration will whenever possible be given to needs of his state in connection with export to Muscat from India of staple foodstuffs such as wheat, flour, rice and sugar. (e) . To enable the Sultan to undertake essential security measures they will grant him for duration of the war and for a reasonable period after cessation of hostilities a monthly allowance of rupees twenty thousand (to date from September 3rd two monthly payments being made in advance) together with an immediate grant of rupees fifty thousand for repair, and construction of fortifications and an advance of rupees fifty thousand in respect of Zanzibar Subsidy. It is understood that receipt of these payments does not seem to impose any obligation ITT - ■ -- —— ; ^ on the Sultan to provide at his own expense guards for protection of facilities granted to Royal Navy or Royal Air Force. (f). Finally as soon as supplies can be made available they are prepared to provide the Sultan free with war stores specified by him in so far as these are in addition, or in substitution for, Hi the free gift of arms etcetera already offered to him. The Sultan will appreciate that in the existing circumstances some delay in supply is unavoidable but His Majesty's Government will do their best to minimise delay so far as they can. 3 # The foregoing should be conveyed in writing to the Sultan and his reply confirming his acceptance should be simi larly recorded. ‘ ^ 4 .

N Would you refer t^o^tjar^t el egrs/n from the Political Agent, Muscat, dated the 3Cth August, a copy of which was forwarded to you with this Office letter l T o.P. Z. 5321/39, dated the 31st August, and connected correspondence, on the subject of the conditions on which the Sultan cf Muscat was prepared to grant the necessary facilities in his territories to His Majesty’s Government in the event of war. Since the conversation with the Political Agent reported in the telegram war has broken out and the Sultan of Muscat has spontaneously expressed his readiness to render sucn assistance as is within his power an offer which has been cordially accepted by His Majesty’s Government. It is now desirable to consider the Sultan’s conditions in detail in the light of the views expresses by the Political Resident and the Government of India, in order that a further communication may be made to the Sultan as soon as possible. A copy of a d.o. telegram from the Government of India enquiring for our preliminary reactions is enclosed. 2 ./ L.Baggallay, Esq., Eoreign Office.2 . 2 . There seems to be no objection to the first three of the Sultan’s conditions, namely - (a) that Muscat should be a party to any peace treaty at any rate to the extent that such a treaty involves Muscat territory or interests. (The Foreign Office have already expressed their concurrence in this suggestion in their letter of the 5th September, ITo.S. 6180/A. ) (b) that facilities given in war time are to cease in peace time except with the specific permission oi the Sultan, and (c) that the Sultan is consulted on all political matters (i.e. in relation to the Sultanate) and his permission is obtained before there are direct dealings with Oman tribal leaders. 3. As to (d) it may be hoped that the Sultan will be satisfied with a premise that the C-oveminent oi India ^ 72.11 give special consideration to the irioeiesus of muscat in connexion with any ban on the exporx oi staple foodstuffs from India. 4. As to (e) the Sultan asks for a subsidy of Rs.20,000 a month unless the Royal Navy are prepared to guarantee/3. guarantee naval co-operation off the coast against internal aggression, in which case the figure would be Rs.16,000 a month. He also asks for two months’ advance of the subsidy, the immediate grant of Rs. 50,000 for the repair and construction of fortifications and permission to obtain an advance of the Zanzibar Subsidy. We are inclined to agree with the view of the Political Resident that the time for bargaining has passed and that we should grant the Sultan’s requests even though they may appear to be a little on the high side. Ho doubt the Admiralty and the Air Ministry will have views on this point in the light of the degree of importance which they attach to tne facilities which the Sultan affords. 5. On the question of a guarantee the views of His Majesty’s Government were stated in our telegram of the 28th August, -1'o.l501, for communication to the Sultan, namely, that His Majesty’s Government would naturally m their own interests b’^ prepared to protect the Sultan against external aggression resulting from a war in wnicn \ . . ... they are engaged; there would be difficulty m promising him a guarantee against Internal disturbance,, • v.. give/The give him such assistance as may be possible, guarantee against external aggression naturally extends to Gwadur, which in any case is geographically a part of India and would he protected as such. It is in regard to internal security measures, i-e. support against attacks from the tribes of the interior of Oman, that we are unable to commit His Majesty’s Government to a specific assurance of protection, since it is not likely that the infantry battalion suggested in paragraph 23 of the Muscat defence appreciation would be available for despat oh frcm India, and it might presumably be impossible to count on a sloop being available to support the Sultan’s authority. 6 . It seems therefore that we have no alternative to accepting, as recarmended by the Political Resident, the Sultan's request for a subsidy of Ks.20,000 per mensem in addition to a lump sum grant of Rs.50,000 and certain advances. The suggested advance of Rs. 50,000 -ro.. o..e Zanzibar Subsidy would of course be met 05 . the l. overn. ent of India, but we think that the new Subsidy and the grant of Rs.50,000, being ad hoc parents for the purposes of the war. should be provided by His Majesty's Government5. and v/e nope that the Treasury will agree. 7. As regards (f), we rege.rd it as of great importance that early steps should he taken to provide the Sultan of flu scat with the arms and equipment of which he is in need and we shall be glad to know from tne Air Ministry what the present position is in the matter and what further action will be possible to speed matters up. it has been agreed that the Sultan should be presented with the arms detailed in paragraph 19 of the Muscat Defence Appreciation, and the Political Agent was authorised to inform the Sultan accordingly. We understand that it is agreed that the cost of this present will be borne by His Majesty’s Government, subject to Treasury sanction, as the arms become available. As regards the possibility of help being obtained from the Government of India they have expressed their readiness to supply up to 100,000 rounds of ammunition (.303) provided that His Majesty’s Government will pay for it. Subject to this proviso v/e would propose, owing to the great difficulty of obtaining early supplies of munitions from the United Kingdom, to press the Government of Indi to do all they possibly can on behalf of His Majesty’s Government to meet the Sultan’s requirements. I might add /add that the Sultan’s list is substantially similar to the list of munitions given in the Muscat defence appreciation which the Oversea Defence Committee recommended in June should be presented by His Majesty’s Government to the Sultan. It is not quite clear wnstner the Sultan asks for the munitions on his list in addition to, or in lieu of, the latter. The Political is. enu i s being asked to clear up the point. 8 . A.s the matter is of some urgency we would suggesu that the most expeditious way of dealing with it, if ycu agree, would be to bring the matter before the Middle hast a /- Sub-C ommitt ee at an early date. 9. I am writing similarly to Jarrett (Admiralty), Strafford (Air Ministry), Simpson (War Office') and Hale (Treasury), and am sending a copy, with a copy oj. t—e correspondence noted on the enclosed list, to the Secretary of the Middle East Sub-Committee.

I have also forwarded a copy of the correspondence which has recently taken place between this Agency, the Director of Customs to the Muscat Government and the Collector of Jus toms Carachi regarding the seisure of six rifles from w r easel arimswai** at Karachi* 1 regret to say that now 1 have little doubt that these rifles originally formed part of the store at Bait-al-FaJaj. 2 * * have discussed the case with the Subedar in Conn and and my views on the actual theft have been noted m the oorrespondence referred to above. A*, however, X had■N had miegiYlngB with regaxd to the general efiicienoy and reliability of the LeYiee and their ueefulneee in tinie of need 1 too* the opportunity afforded to sound the Subedar on these points# He expressed grave doubts concerning both their fighting qualities and their integrity* I gathered that he was far from satisfied with the existing state of affairs* This Indian Officer is an efficient and intelligent man whose education is well above the standard usually found among persons of his ran** 3* I have had some little experience of Baluchis as soldiers and I have found that they make fair soldiers when recruited from high grade and good clase men. The Levies are largely recruited from M&amp;tr&amp;h town and in the majority of oases are of no class at all* Some are half Axab and half Baluchi and a minority are Arabs from outside Musoat and Osan limits* 1 am inclined to the view that the Officer Comanding's doubts recorded in paragraph 2 of this letter are well founded* 4* The ammunition oase has disclosed that a very lamentable state of affairs has been in existance for some time* There Is no doubt that many members of the Levies whose names have not actually appeared in the proceedings have at one time or the other been involved* This com bined with the Officer Commanding's statement has caused me considerable disquiet* His Highness relies on the tax taws Levies for the defence of Matrah and Muscat in the event of a tribal outbreak* The/ are in fact the only force at his disposal with the exception of a few Palace guards and some twenty or thirty policemen* He places considerable trust in them and is loath to allow them to er^gagg,enga£# in any work away from headquarters* Hie eomawhut intrioate negotiations in the interior may break down at any time and it a breakdown does occur it may give rise to tribal disturbances result!eg in possible raids on Matrah and Muscat* It would be disastrous if His Highness's trust was proved to be misplaced should a crisis of this nature arise* 5 . in ay opinion steps should be te-rfen without delay to remedy the present state of affairs* It is essential in peace time that there should be a re liable force in the Musoat-iiatrah area for the ^reservation of law and order and the protection of the local residents of the two towns many of whom axe British subjects* The necessity for a reliable force in war-time is obvious. I suggest that the Sultan be inforrad of ihe doubt which exists regarding the integrity and fighting qua lities of the Levies and that he be a sited to consider the advisability of strengthening his force by the in troduction of a certain number of men who have recently served in the Indian Arsy* I have recorded in the form of an anuexure to this letter n^y views on the tyye of man required to strengthened the Lev and a suggested reorganisation to meet the extra cost* I have the honour to be f Your most obedient servant# rollti cal Agent &amp; H.M's Consul# MuscatvU, Hota on the uo««l.bl« r»-organi »tlon of the I.?yie_8. 1, Th« State budget requiree careful banning end auet Ot~ be »i&gt;ax«d undue etrain so will not i&gt;rove practicable unlcoe it can be carried out without extra expenditure • 2.

We observe that on remarking upon these schemes the Political President suggests that in the case of Muscat it would be useful if we could strike some sort of confidential bargain with the Sultan, which in exchange for our rearming and training his forces free, would allow us to make use of his waters and territory in war even if he remained neutral. 3. The Admiralty have had, of course, a direct interest in this question ever since the establishment of the advanced base at Khor Kuwai, When the base was established we recognised that its use in war would be dependent upon the Sultan's consent, though we assumed that Muscat would normally enter into a war as our ally. From the purely practical and legal points of view, it is difficult to see what advantage there would be either for ourselves or for the Sultan of Muscat in adopting the precise form suggested by the Political Resident for an agreement enabling us to use his ports. The fact that he was not bound by the agreement to declare war on our enemy would in no way prevent the enemy from treating him as a hostile belligerent as soon as the agreement was implemented. J.P. Gibson Bsq., India Office, S.W.l. Nevertheless/Nevertheless, we can easily understand that it night e desirable to proceed on these lines, for the political reason that the Sultan at the present time could much more readily he induced to enter into an undertaking of this kind tnan to sign a formal treaty of Alliance which is the only alternative having the same effect. V/e should he glad to have both your views and those of the Foreign Office on the question whether the surest prospect of obtaining the desired facilities would lie in trying to negotiate an agreement on the lines suggested now or in waiting until war actually breaks out. 4. The position is further complicated by the Anglo-french declaration of 1062 in which the two countries engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of Muscat and which was held, when the depot at lOior Kuwai was being set up, to preclude acquiring land in sovereignty without the concurrence of the French. On the face o± it, -t does not appear that an agreement freely made by the Sultan to let us use his ports in time of war would be contrary to_the_ declaration. If, however, it should be decided to approach the Sultan, as proposed by the Political Resident, and the propriety of so doing without French consent is considered doubtful, the present would seem to be a very favourable moment to ask the French for a statement of their concurrence in our obtaining from the oultan when the necessity arises an understanding to let us use his ports and waters m time of war. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to uaggallay, who will no dou t express the views of the Foreign Office on the two questions raised in paragraphs 3 and 4 above. A copy is also being sent to the Air Mi .istry for information. Yours sincerely, / n-a \ r* r* n o *1' _No. C/187.

The object of mounting the guns in the fort is osten sibly to protect Muscat from a sea attack by a submarine or lightly armed merchant ship. I feel that the fiultan is also thinking of the possibility of a land attack ana ne ./ill probably decide to place one gun in Fort Mirani and the other in some suitable position at Aatrah* At my request the Senior Naval Officer (who is here at present in H# t.S. Choreham) has deputed his gunnery experts to examine the guns and also Fort Mirani and to report on the practicabi lity of the proposal. His Highness is undoubtedly concerned about the present International situation. The impression that was conveyed to me was that whereas nothing definite had been &amp;aid there could be no doubt of the part that Muscat would be required to play in the event of His Majesty's Govern- ment becoming involved in a European war and that His High ness would like to see a little active preparation being fworta trO safeguard the country from the possible coneequen- ces of her participation as an ally of Great Britain. However there is another side to the question — s am an Important one. The purchase by Sultan of a large supply of aanunitlon and anna and poeslbly fountain Art11- I lary will have an immediate effect in Oman. The -ultan has been increasing his influence by peaceful means. There are some influential Shaikhs who have not yet made up their mirirtu to forsake the Imam for liis Highness or not and nothing is more calculated to induce them to come to a decision than the acquisition by the Sultan of a large* stock of arms and aamunition.

The terms of payment have already been mentioned in para 5 of my letter under reference. In order that there may be no doubt on the subject I now repeat them i- (a) Delivery to be as soon as possible. (b) Payment to be spread over four years. (c) The Zanzibar Subsidy to be security if required. 3. I notice that Vicker and Brethier guns have been ask ed for and not Bren guns. This is probably because the Levy are acquainted with these guns and not with Bren guns. 4 . No mention has been made of artillery. This is because during the course of our conversation when His Highness announced his intention of buying a field gun ^ * .-v- - - - I told His Highness that in my opinion a gun of that type would be of little practical value to him. He informed me that he want ed a gun that was sufficiently mobile to employ off the flat country. The answer was the mountain gun and I promise^ / to ask2 to ask for oqpert advice if he would like me to. His Highness said he would he grateful. I expected that a reference would he made to this point hut although it has not been it appears to me that the application to purchase has been deferred only until advice on the most suitable type of artillery is forthcoming. The terrain of Muscat and Oman is sufficiently well known not to require a detailed description and as Major R.G. Price f H.A., General Staff Officer, Air Headquarters ’Iraq, is acquainted with the military position in the State perhaps his advice could he sought on this point for communication to His Highness. 5. Should it he decided to act on my recommendation expressed in para 8 of my letter under reference it will of course he unnecessary to tender any advice to His Highness on • the subject of the suitability of any particular type of artillery for eiqployment in Muscat and Oman.

In accordance with your verbal request, I have the honour to inform you that the 3 pdr.Hotchkiss guns belonging to His Highness The Sultan of Muscat have been inspected and various positions where two of these might be mounted have been examined. All guns were in good condition. 2. A superficial examination of the Portuguese Port was carried out. As far as can be seen, the general stonework is in fairly good condition with the exception of the towers which are all in a very bad state of repair, and their condition could only be remedied at excessive cost; the idea of mounting guns in them therefore has been discarded. 3. The site of the right hand tower, marked ,, A ,, in the attached sketch gives a very good position for a gun, as it commands the three roads adequately as well as the harbour and sea entrance. If the tower were levelled down to the rock, a very satisfactory gun position could be made by embedding a steel plate f inches thick, and about three feet square underneath a bed of concrete twelve inches thick with the holding down bolts for the gumnounting passing through the plate and concrete. 4. Another suitable position for a gun is on the site marked 'B', which would require a certain amount of reinforcing in the gallery underneath in order to mount the gun securely as suggested. The efficacy of this position would be improved if the round tower with the flag on it were removed. 5. It is considered that two guns mounted in the positions described above would efficiently cover approaches to Muscat from the land and sea. I have the honour to be.

If you v/ill refer to past files (doubtless you have already done so on the subject of the levies) you will find a mass of stuff, most of it of a controversial nature, on the subject of the Levies* fitting qualities and their integrity. I met Byard at Bahrain {where he is now Assistant to Belgrave) on my recent visit there and took the opportunity of discussing with him the question of the Levies. I enclose a copy of an interesting report which he made at my request, mere is no doubt that Byard did a great deal to improve the Levies on taking them over: they had been without a British Commandant for a considerable time ov/ing to our inability to get a suitable Officer in spite of efforts in that direction. 3* llease study Byard's report (which you should consider as for your personal information) and let me have your views. As you will see his general viev/ is that if the present rate of pay is to stand it would be impossible to get any elements other than Baluchis to enlist, and he makes certain suggestions as to the recruiting of such elements. He agrees v/ith you that Indians would make the best garrison troops provided pay could be sufficiently increased to attract them. There is, however, one strong drawback to your suggestion (paragraph 5 of your note) / that Captain T.Hickinbotham, OBE., Political Agent, Muscat•- 2 - \*Y that Indians should be recruited from Glass A of the Reserve and this you touch on at the end of your note. Glass A Reserve would certainly be called up in the event of war and 1 do not see how we could possibly ask Army Headquarters to exempt the men of this class who v/ere in the Muscat Levies from being called up« If we did ask Army Headquarters I am certain that our request would be refused. 4. I was glad to note from your various letters that Subadar Jahan Dad is a capable officer. it may be that coming straight from an Indian Regiment he expects rather too high a standard. However this may be please impress on him tactfully that until the Levies can be improved he must of course make the best of them. We don't want the attitude adopted by certain previous Indian officers towards the Levy Corps.

Offioere and recruiting appear to be the difficulties.

He is useless and idle and an intri#ier a-id no Indian Officer will be safe while he is in the Unit. As regards men. If the present rate of pay is to stand, it will, X think, be impossible to get anyone other than Daluch to enlist. In which case I recommend that my system be carried on i.e. take only baluch who have been resident in the country for two years aid are prepared to sign on for three years and have not any interest oTersea, therefore likely to take on again. Canteen, farm, dairy and welfare work paid very well in this respect.

I have examined Byard*s report; in particular para graph 9 in which he gives his views regarding future enlist ment. I have also examined the old correspondence regarding the Levies. I do not care for the local town Baluchi and do not consider that he will make a good soldier. I have already given my views on the present type of man that is being en listed. I consider that there should be a stiffening, as it were, of good material. It matters little if the material is Indian or Arab. I have suggested Indian as the Arab experi ment has so far not been tried here and it would be at least a couple of years from the time of its inception beiore judgement could be pronounced. 4&gt; if you will refer to paragraphs 3 and 6 of my not= which formed an enclosure to my letter No. C/1&amp; of 12th June, 1939, you will see that I do not propose directly to increase the pay but to do so indirectly by giving full ration to all the men in place of the single atta issue which is the present practice. This will make the terms of remuneration equivalent to those of the Indian Army. I have proposed reducing the strength to meet the extra cost. I am not in e Hon'ble Lieut-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E.) C.B.E.j Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.- 2 - &lt;\°\ no in a position to say if men will enlist at these rates or not but Subedar Jehan Dad, who is a Punjabi himself and a serving Indian Officer, tells me that he has little doubt that they will* &lt;&gt; 1 5 # in view of the importance of Muscat and our communi cations I should have thought that Army Headquarters would have been prepared to grant exemption from training or recall of the few men required for the Muscat Levy but if you do not consider that it is worth approaching them there is an end of the matter* Hov/ever even when men have completed their Reserve Service they will still be young enough for the Levy. The average age of enlistment into the Indian Army is 17^ to 19 years. The terms of service are now seven years with the colours and eight with the reserve making a total of fifteen years combined service* The man who has just completed his reserve service will be from 32£ to 3a years of age. In the prime of life. Men of this type could be enlisted. X am inclined to think that the Arab experiment could be tried with good effect. I mean the training of local tribes men. The Aden Protectorate Levies have been a success and the Aden Armed Police have now become more than two-third Arab in composition. They have proved to be trustworthy and loyal. The Trans-Jordan Frontier Force is another example of the succes ful use of local material. His Highness might enlist a few Omanis or Batinah Arabs, young sturdy men of good family, as an experiment. If they turned out well there would be no need to worry about Indians. In fact I am inclined to recommend that this experiment be tried at once whatever is decided about the introduction of an Indian element.vl (^GOVERNMENT ST OF INDIA. Department.

This general proposition must he qualified by the reservation that war areas of lesser strategic importance may have to he temporarily abandoned in favour of areas of greater strategic importance, and if we were to give the Sultan a guarantee to defend his territory, he might call upon us to make good tliat^i^rantee at a time when it wai^ strategically inconvenient to do so* 5 # Such inconveniences are, however, inseparable vom all alliances, and if we shall in fact need to make use of Muscat territory and waters in the event of war and snail not he able to do so without giving the Sultan a guarantee, it looks as if we shall have to give the guarantee* C*G*Jarrett Esq*, Admiralty* 6/6. We feel that the questionswhether we should give the guarantee now or later, and whether we should ask the Sultan to become an ally or merely to allow us the use of his territory and waters, are matters upon which only the India Office can advise. But we entirely agree with the observation in the fourth sentence of paragraph 3 of your letter. r{' whatever is decided, we do not think it necessary to seek the concurrence of the French gov ernmen t.

From a practical point of view, they ought to be delighted at anything which added to our strength. 8. For the Sultan to let us use his territory and ports would, of course, be an unneutral act which would entitle our enemies to treat him as a hostile belligerent, but they would probably do so in any case if they thought it worth while, as we do not suppose that they would pay much attention to the precise nature of our relationship with him.
