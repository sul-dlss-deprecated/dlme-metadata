Establishment of Council of State for 'Iraq. No. S.1)./170a , dated the 30th November J9l!0. To—All Officers of the Civil Administration in Mesopotamia. The accompanying record of the steps taken by His Excellency the High Commissioner since his arrival at Basrah in the direction of setting up a national administration in 'Iraq is forwarded for the information of all concerned. The provisional Council of State set up as explained in the record has been entrusted by His Excellency the High Commissioner with the task of conducting the administration of the country under his control pending the convocation of a National Assembly to decide upon a constitution and frame an organic law. In the meantime the officers and departments hitherto forming part of the British Civil Administration in 'Iraq will come directly under the orders of the Council of State, and the re-organisation of the administrative machine will proceed under its direction, subject to the High Commissioner's general control, as rapidly as is expedient and possible. Political Officers and Assistant Political Officers in the provinces and Heads of Departments at Headquarters and elsewhere will henceforth report to, and receive order- from, the various Ministries set forth in document No. 3 of this record. Document No. 4 thereof shows the distribution of administrative departments among the Ministries, and will form a guide to all concerned as to the proper Ministry to be addressed in regard to the various branches of administration. For instance, correspondence regarding Municipal Administration or Police matters will be addressed to the Ministry of the Interior; that relating to Accounts to the Ministry of Finance; and so forth. In future, therefore, correspondence relating to the departments set forth in document 4 should not be addressed to the High Commissioner, to whom, however, all matters relating to foreign policy, military operations and affairs and the like will continue to be addressed, such matters being outside the sphere of the National (lovernment. . C. C. GARBETT, Secretary to the High Commissioner. Sole on the proceedings of 11.TJ. the High Commissioner since his arrival at Basrah. His Excellency Sir Percy Z. Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., K.C.M.G., arrived at Basrah on the 1st October 1920, and assumed charge of his office at High Commissioner for Mesopotamia under a salute of 17 guns. Having spent four days at Basrah in continuous consultation with representatives of all elements of the population of the place. His Excellency embarked on the 5th October on the S. 1 en route for Baghdad. On the way up river the High Commissioner held receptions of local notables at Qurnah, Qalat Salih, Amarah and Kut-al-Amarah and thus had favourable opportunities of ascertaining the views and wishes of the people of those districts, as also he had had previously at Nasiriyah, which he visited by air during his stay at Basrah. On the 11th October 1920, he arrived by special train from Kut at Baghdad at 5 p.m. and was received by a large gathering of officers and of the notables of the capital headed by the G.O.C.-in-Chief. The next two weeks were spent by the High Commissioner in close consultation with the notables and people of Baghdad and its surroundings in a series of public and private audiences. H.E. furthermore paid a visit to Mosul on the 16th October returning the following day after seeing and taking into consultation the notables of that place. As the result of the consultations above-mentioned the High Commissioner was in a position to formulate his policy in respect of the setting up of a National Government of 'Iraq by the 23rd October 192U, when he paid a personal visit to H.H. the Naqib of Baghdad to- invite him to form a provisional Council of State to carry on the administration of the country under the High Commissioner s control pending the convocation of a representative National Assembly to decide upon the future constitution of the State and to frame an organic law in connection therewith. The Naqib after some heart-searching accepted office from a sense of duty to his country. The negotiations leading up to the formation of a Council of State were largely conducted orally between His Excellency and His Highness the Naqib, and the details of the scheme for setting up a provisional national government were worked out in the same way, but the documents attached to this note may be of interest as marking the successive stages arrived at in the coui-se of those negotiations, which may be said to have reached their culminating point in the first formal meeting of the Council of State on the 43th November 1920, which the High Commissioner attended to explain his policy and their responsibilities to the assembled Ministers, and to obtain their acceptance of the working instructions framed for them. 3153 50 1.21 AI.

The High Commissioner desires to keep the public informed as far as possible as to the measures -which he finds it expedient to take in order to give effect to the wishes of His Majesty's Government, that all that is possible should be done to facilitate and expedite a decision on the part of the people of 'Iraq as to the precise form of government which they desire, and, pursuant to that decision, to promote the early establishment of such a ( Jovern- ment under the guidance of (!reat Britain as Mandatory. The position is that the question of choice is one which must be decided by the people themselves, and this can only be properly done by the convocation of a National Congress fully representative of the people. Electoral regulations are being devised by the Committee of ex-Deputies now sitting, and all possible steps will be taken to expedite action on their recommendations and to start the -electoral machinery in the settled districts, but it must be obvious to all that in certain localities the business of election cannot proceed until the inhabitants have made their submission to Government, and settled down to normal conditions. In any case the work of the elections can hardly be completed in less than two or three months. Meanwhile, in order, firstly, that the leaders of the people may participate more fully in the work of Government, and secondly, to obviate disappointment on the part of the peaceable and loyal elements of the population at the delay involved by the elections, the High Commissioner has decided to invite His Highness the Naqib to assist patriotically towards this end by forming and presiding over a Council of State, which, under the High Commissioner's guidance, will direct the Government pending the decision of the Congress and the framing of the law of the •constitution. The names of the gentlemen who have accepted His Highness the Na(jib's invitation to become members of the Council will be notiiied in due course, as also the duties assigned to them as soon as details are finally completed. Those who share the High Commissioner's •desire to hasten the Assembly of the Congress and the realisation of their decision can best assist him by co-operating in the task of bringing about forthwith the submission of the disturbed districts, so that the re-establishment of law and order may not be delayed, and the elections may proceed. The High Commissioner, in conclusion, wishes to make it clear that the establishment of the Council of State now created with a view to applying itself to the work of reconstruction under contemplation will in no wise prejudice the work of the National Congress and the free decisions at which it will arrive. VI.—Proclamation. Whereas by Notification, dated the 17th June 1920, it was announced that His Majesty's Government had authorised the calling of a General Elective Assembly for the purpose of preparing an organic law for 'Iraq; And whereas it is considered expedient that, pending the convocation of such General Assembly and the framing thereby of an organic law, the Government of the country should be conducted, subject to my supervision and direction, by a provisional National Government:4 Now, therefore, I, Major-General Sir P. Z. Cox, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., K.C.M.Cl., by virtue of the authority vested in me as High Commissioner for Mesopotamia, do hereby proclaim as follows:— 1. There shall be constituted a Council of State consisting of a President, Ministers for the following Departments, Interior, Finance, Justice, Auqaf, Education and Health, Defence, Public Works, Commerce, and such other members without portfolios as may be nominated. 2. Until the organic law is promulgated and brought into effect, the Council of State and Ministers shall be responsible for the conduct, subject to my supervision and control, of the administration of (Jovernment, excluding foreign affairs, military operations and in general military affairs, except such military affairs as concerns solely the locally recruited forces. Made at Baghdad this 11th day of November 1920. P. Z. COX, High Commissioner for Mesopotamia. VII.—Instructions for the Council of State (as finally issued). I. The Council of State should realise that at any rate until the convening of a National Assembly for the purpose of deciding the future constitution of 'Iraq, 1, as High Commis sioner, am personally and directly responsible to His Majesty's Government for the administration of the country. Accordingly, in the event of difference of opinion between myself and the Council of State in reference to matters under disposal, the final decision will rest with me. II. In view of the fact that the elections for an Assembly and its convocation must necessarily take some time, I have decided upon taking preparatory measures for the conduct of the actual administration (with the exception of such questions as concern foreign policy and military considerations) under my supervision by the formation of a Council of State under the presidency of His Highness the Naqib as President. Such Council shall consist of Ministers, some of whom will preside over the various Departments of State, while the others will be Members of Council without portfolio. III. The Head of each State Department will be the Minister in charge of it and the administration of such department will vest in him subject— (а) to the control of the Council over the action of the Ministers. (б) to the hearing of tlie views expressed by the British officers selected by me as advisers to the several departments. As regards the functions of these Advisers, they are to he not executive but advisory, but I trust that the Council and the members in charge of Departments will realise that the officers whom I select for the post of Adviser, having been so selected owing to their long experience of the working of the administration and their knowledge of the conduct of the departments attached to the said Ministries, it is necessary both that attention should be paid to their views and that the latter should be taken into careful consideration. .(c) to the fact that in the last resort supreme control will vest in my own person. IV. It seems to me that the best method of conducting the affairs of the departments of State will be by the reference of all matters concerning a particular Ministry to its Minister through his Adviser, and it will be incumbent on the latter to refer communications and papers so received to his Minister without delay, in order that the ^Minister may be able to take action for the disposal of the matter after consulting the Adviser. Similarly, if a Minister desires to initiate action in regard to any matter concerning his Ministry, it is necessary either that he should call his Adviser into consultation in the first instance or that he should send his orders to the department concerned through the Adviser so that the latter may be able to put forward his views before the matter takes final shape. V. Such being the position, it is necessary to make provision for the contingency of a ' difference of opinion on any matter between the Minister and his Adviser, thus :— (а) if in any case the Adviser tenders advice to his Minister and the hitter feels unable to accept such advice, the Minister should call the Adviser into consultation. If they are unable to arrive at an agreement after discussion of the matter, and if the Adviser considers the matter of sullicient importance to be pursued further, he will have the right to ask the Minister to refer the matter to the Council of State for consideration. It will then be incumbent on the Minister to suspend action on the matter until the next meeting of the Council, when the subject will be brought before it. (б) in the interval which occurs while the matter is being referred to the Council the Minister and Adviser have full discretion to refer the matter to me as High Commissioner. I shall thus have an opportunity of conveying my views to the Council of State without the least prejudice to the procedure provided for in Article 10 of this programme. YI. As regards the Council, it is necessary that it should hold regular meetings at least once a week or even more as may be necessary.0 VII. To facilitate the business of eHicient administration the Council requires a competent Secretary and a clerical stall', for the appointment of whom steps should be taken without delay. V11L All business to be brought before the (Vmncil meeting for discussion should be intimated by the Minister concerned to the Secretary of the Council, who will prepare a list of agenda for each meeting in time for circulation— (а) to the High Commissioner, (б) to all Ministers and Advisers, at least 24 hours before the time fixed for the meeting. As a general rule no question not included on the agenda paper should be discussed at such meeting. At any rate, no formal resolution should be taken on it, except in the case of any matter of great urgency the prompt disposal ol which is essential. IX. The Secretary will attend all meetings of the Cabinet and will prepare a record of the proceedings of such meetings in the form of a list and statement of matters in respect of which resolutions have been passed. These lists will be circulated within 24 hours of such meeting under the Secretary's signature— (a) to the High Commissioner, (h) to all Ministers and Advisers. Each Minister will be responsible to give effect to resolutions of the Council affecting it and to report suoh action to the Secretaiy for the information of the Council at subsequent meetings. In accordance with the usual practice the deliberations of the Council are to be considered confidential and it is not permitted to disclose them outside the Council. X. All resolutions of the Council will be final, subject to their confirmation by myself as head of the Government. I must also reserve for myself the right inherent in me as High Commissioner to veto or modify on grounds of expediency any resolution passed by the Council. XI. In order that the Council maybe kept informed of all matters appertaining to the subjects included in the agenda, the presence of the Adviser will be necessary at the meetings of the Council while any matter affecting the Ministry to which he belon'gs is under discussion. He will have the right iu the course of the proceedings to tender his advice regarding the matter under consideration, but he will not take part in the recording of votes. XII. It is my confident hope that the instructions above set forth in regard to the working of the Council of State and the several Ministries and their relations with myself on the one hand and with the Advisers on the other will conduce to the smooth progress of the administrative machinery at Headquarters. As regards the central departments at present engaged in the work of administration, in view of the fact that for several years past they have been working smoothly, the attachment of them to the new scheme of Government, after the necessary adjustments, should offer no serious difficulty. As regards the administration of the provinces, it is probable that we shall be confronted with a good many difficulties—but In'Shallah they will admit of solution. XIII. As you all know, the administration of the various districts and sub-districts of Jraq is still, as it has been for some time past, conducted by an organisation of British Political Officers, with suitable local personnel in minor administrative posts as D.A.P.O.'s and Mudirs, &amp;c. ; some districts are still in a disturbed state and British troops are still present therein ; consequently in such places it is difficult to make the change from British to indigenous personnel in the immediate circumstances ; on the other hand, there are districts in which it is possible to take the necessary steps in the desired direction as soon as competent personnel is forthcoming. XIV. A nd whereas it is among the duties ol the Council of State to devise administrative measures to promote the speedy pacification of the provinces, the said Council should give their early attention to the selection of experienced and suitable candidates from, indigenous elements of the population for appointment by degrees to those posts where such appointment is expedient. Having done so, they should formulate their proposals with the names of candidates recommended in each case for my consideration and orders. • # VIII.—Copy of Letter from High Commissioner to each Member of the Electoral Law Committee, dated 12th November 1920. Sir, 1 have been informed by the President of the Committee for the 'Iraq Elections that the said Committee has now completed the task for which it was convened by Sir A. T. Wilson, Acting Civil Commissioner, in August last, and that the draft Electoral Law prepared by it is now ready for submission to me. 1 have accordingly directed that the Committee shall be considered dissolved with effect from the 7th November 1920 (the date of the above-mentioned letter of the President), and 1 desire to mark the occasion by recording my very high appreciation of the manner in which you have acquitted yourself of the task entrusted to you as a member of the said Committee- 3153 B6 For three months you have laboured in a cause which, T am convinced, will prove of sreat and lasting benefit to your Country, and I feel sure that, when the Electoral Law, which%ou have helped 10 frame, assumes its final form and is put into operation in connection with the election of members to the National Assembly, which it is my intention to convene as soon as possible, your fellow-countrymen will realise that you have amply earned the thanks which I now conveyed to you on their behalf and on my own. 1 hope that it will be my good fortune to see you hereafter continuing to take as prominent a part in the public life of your country as you have done during the past three months by participating in the framing of an Electoral Law for 'Iraq.

The Council met informally on Wednesday the 10th November 1920, and the draft instructions framed by the High Commissioner were read over and discussed. Section 1 thereof was accepted. Section 2 w^s accepted, but the Minister of Defence asked for an explanation as to his present functions before the convocation of the Assembly. It was resolved that an inquiry be made from His Excellency the High Commissioner in that connection. Section 3 was accepted. Section 4 was accepted, but the Council resolved that the wording should be :—' It will k ' be incumbent on the Adviser to refer communications and papers so received to his Minister without delay, in order that the Minister may be able to take action for the disposal of the ' matter after consultation with the Adviser.' » Section o was accepted. Section (i was accepted. Section / was accepted and the Council suggested the appointment of Saiyid Husain Effendi Afnan as Secretary, and agreed that he should nominate a sufficient number of clerks and submit their names to the Council for approval. Sections 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 were accepted. Sections 13 and 14 were accepted, but the Council suggested the amendment of the wording as follows :— And whereas it is among the duties of the Council of State to devise means for ensuring peace and order outside (in the provinces), the Council thinks it advisable that the Ministry of Interior be permitted to find and select experienced and suitable officials from the indigenous elements of the population for appointment by degrees to those posts when such appointment is expedient. Having done so, it will submit their names and their duties to the Council and these will, after confirmation, be submitted to His Excellencv the High Commissioner for orders.' His Excellency the Minister for Education, Izzat Pasha, asked for 10 days' leave to proceed to Kirkuk on private affairs, and. stated that he would ask the Minister of Interior, His Excellency Saiyid Talib Pasha, to act for him. The Council agreed to this. It was decided that the next meeting should take placed on Saturday next the 13th November 1920, at 8 o'clock (Arabic time). ft was then resolved as follows : Whereas the pacification of the provinces is a matter of great importance and this depends on the improvement of certain conditions in the provinces and seeing that one of the improvements is the pardoning of some of the deportees who have not committed an unpardonable offence, among them being Shaikh Mukhif, it would be desirable therefore that, if the Government agreed to pardon him, and to order his return to Baghdad, reliable securities be taken from him pledging him to obedience and submissionto the orders of the Government so that no trouble may be caasefl by him in future. Plus action will be useful for the purpose of attaining the object we have referred to above, viz., the pacification of the country and the encouragement of the insurgents to submit. Should there be no reason which is unknown to us, we would request that action be taken in this direction. • m mt . ai i i ci - i i The said request should apply to certain other deportees, viz., bhaikh Ahmad al bhaiKU Daud, Jafar al Shabibi, Muhammad EITendi al Mustafa al Khalil, Saiyid Khairi Effendi Hindawi, Rauf Effendi and his companions from amongst the people of Hillah, viz., Saiyid Ahmad ibn Saiyid Salim, Jabbar ibn Hassani, Ali ibn Hammadi al Hasan, Saiyid Abdul Salama Effendi al Ivhatib and laufiq Edendi ibn ^Mnlla Ljaila, and Abdul Ivahiuan Lffendi ibn Hasan Effendi of Kirkuk. Dated 10th November 1920. True Copy. (Sgd.) ABDUL RAHMAN, Naqib al Ashraf, Baghdad. XI.-Letter to His Highness the Naqib in reply to his Report on the Proceedings of the second informal Meeting of the Council of State. Office of the High Commissioner, Baghdad, 12th November 1920. To—His Highness Saiyid Abdul Rahman Effendi al Naqib. I am directed by His Excellency the High Commissioner to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your report on the proceedings of the Council of State at its meeting of yesterday, the 10th* November 1920. His Excellency notes with pleasure that the draft of instructions issued by him for the guidance of the Council has met with its general approval and has directed me to make the following observations on the points of detail raised by the Council. As regards the remarks made against para. 2 of the draft His Excellency would like to discuss the question of tlie present functions of the Minister of Defence with .I afar Pasha al Askari and will arrange a meeting with him. ... ■ ^ u As regards para. 4 the wording proposed by the Council is approved by His Excellency. The words ' it will be incumbent on the latter {i.e., the Adviser) to refer communications and ' papers so received to his Minister without delay, in order that the Ministei may be able to ' take action for the disposal of the matter after consultation with the Adviser ' are being substituted for the words ' it will be incumbent .... disposal of the matter in the original draft of this section. As regards para. 7 His Excellency the High Commissioner is pleased- to approve the appointment of Say id Husain Effendi al Afnan as Secretary to the Council, and hopes that he will be able to take up his appointment at an early date. The question of his staff should be taken up by the Council in consultation with the Ministry of- Interior. As regards paras. 13 and 14 His Excellency notes the views expressed by the Council, and has in accordance therewith decided to substitute the following for the wording of the original draft of para. 14 in the hope that it will meet the wishes of the Council, namely % ' Para. 14. And whereas it is among the duties of the Council of State to devise administrative measures to promote the speedy pacification of the provinces, the said ( ouncil should pay their early attention to the selection of experienced and suitable candidates from indigenous elements of the population for appointment by degrees to those posts when such appointment is expedient. Having done so, they should formulate their proposals with the names of candidates recommended in each case for my consideration and orders.' With regard to the application of Izzat Pasha, Minister of Education, for 10 days' leave to visit Kirkuk on private affairs, I am directed by His Excellency to express the hope that he will defer going on leave for a few days in order to be present at the next meeting of the Council on Saturday, 'the 13th November 1920, at 2 p.m., when His Excellency the High Commissioner hopes to have the pleasure of a formal meeting with the Council. Finally with regard to the views expressed by the Council regarding the pardon or release of certain individuals at present under detention in connection with the recent disturbances, 1 am directed to inform you that the matter will receive his early and sympathetic consideration with a view to the necessary action in cases in which such action can be taken without prejudice to the interests of the State. The High Commissioner will communicate again with the Council as soon as he has examined the record. H. S t . J. B. PH1LB\, for Secretary. # XII. (a).—Telegram No. 12988, dated the 26th October 1920, from His Excellency the High Commissioner to the Secretary of State for India. I submit progress report as follows :— After seeing notables at Basrah, I visited Nasiriyah and then proceeded by river from Basrah to Baghdad, halting at Qurnah, Qalat Salih, Amarah and Kut. At these centres all 3153 Cs important Shaikhs and leaders of opinion were assembled to meet me, and both publicly in Durbar and privately in conversation with each important individual, 1 explained policy of His Majesty's Government and nature of my mission ; adding that while 1 was anxious to hear what they had to say 1 did not propose to come to definite conclusions until J had visited Mosul and settled down at Baghdad. Since reaching Baghdad 1 have paid a visit to Mosul. In the Basrah Wilayat 1 found no enthusiasm for the idea of a National Government. The merchants and people oC Basrah itself have grown rich, their trade in prospering ; they fully appreciate the advantages of British Administration and have no active desire for a material change. In the Qurnah, Qalat Salih and Amarah Divisions the Shaikhs and land owners, though obliged to pay revenue regularly, do so willingly now that they are secure in their tenure and immune from the necessity of periodically bribing rapacious officials. They contemplate with some dismay the prospect of Arab Government and urge that it would be a betrayal on our part if after rescuing them from the Turks we were to deliver them to the uncontrolled mercy of Arab rule. They were reassured, however, that Arab officials when they came would work under proper safeguards and British supervision. All seemed unanimous in opinion that if National Government had to come it must be a monarchy under our effective supervision. In the Baghdad and Mosul Wilayats the type and temper of the people are different. They are not to the same degrees immersed in commerce, and they are in closer touch with the West. The practical benefits of British Administration are less apparent to them and its disadvantages more pressing. Among them there is a very general and impatient desire for a greater share in the administration and the early establishment of a National Government. The majority of the intelligentsia are no doubt strong Nationalists, but, realising that they cannot walk alone, are inclined to trust in our assurances and look forward to gradual formation of a National Administration under our auspices. In the minority is the extreme element composed of a few old firebrands and a number of ambitious and visionary young men who believe that if we were not here they could run the Administration and have the plums for themselves. A few Aveeks ago they were convinced that if they made a vigorous and immediate effort, they could get rid of us and our Mandate, and having done so enlist foreign experts at their pleasure. They have in a great measure been disabused of these illusions, partly by our vigorous repressive measures and partly by recent benevolent announcements by His Majesty's Government which have taken the wind out of their sails. To be continued in my next following telegram. XII. (b)—Telegram No. 12987, dated the 26th October 1920, from His Excellency the High Commissioner to the Secretary of State for India. The actual political position is now as follows :— If the rebellion has not entirely subsided, it no longer gives cause for serious anxiety, and it only remains to clear up the debris in certain localities. Meanwhile, in connection with my coming, the general public are expectant of some immediate step in the direction of National Government wdiich will finally demonstrate the bona fides of our intentions. It is clear that the question of the precise form of the future government and the type of ruler to be selected can properly be decided only by a representative congress of all communities and sections of the people. In this connection a Committee of about 30 ex-deputies have been occupied for the last few weeks in framing an electoral law for this particular congress. The draft will be complete in a week or so, but at least three and probably more months must elapse before k the election can be completed, and a decision reached on the above fundamental issues. Meanwhile it does not seem to me advisable or possible that I can sit still. On the one hand, if no action is taken public opinion, which is now mainly friendly, will become disappointed and distrustful. Likewise from our own point of view, it is urgent that a National Govern- • ment of some form should get to work without delay to raise local forces with a view gradually to relieving our troops. Moreover, many questions are now arising which concern the future of 'Iraq, and which I do not feel justified in deciding without consulting a representative body of the people of the country. I have therefore taken the following action in order to form a provisional Government:— 1 have invited His Highness the Naqib of Baghdad, whose public prestige and the respect with which he is generally held make him eminently suited for the position, to form and become President of the Council of State for the conduct of the administration under my control until such time as the National Assembly meets and decides upon the future Government. For present purposes it is essential to make it representative of all Wilayats and communities. It will therefore consist of 17 or 18 members. Of these, eight will be given portfolios and work the existing departments under the advice of the present scretaries and subject to my supreme control. In order that it may have a National and not British faeade it has appeared to me important that the invitation to members and the distribution of duties should emanate trom the Naqib and not from myself, and this has been done; but each item was suggested or approved by myself.9 The distribution is as follows: — 1 - President ol' Council and Recon- The Naqib. struetion. Interior - 9 3. Finance - 4. Justice - - - - 5. Auqaf - 6. Education - - - - 7. Defence (i.e., Levies, Gendarmerie, &amp;c.). 8. Public Works _ _ _ 9. Commerce - - - - Saiyid Talib Pasha. (Of Basrah.) Sassoon Effendi llaskail. (Held office iiL Ottoman Government before the War.) Hassan Pachachi (leading lawyer of Bagh dad). Mustafa Alusi (formerly Qazi of Mecca). I/zat Pasha of Kirkuk. Jafar Pasha. (Major-( Jeneral in Faisal's Army.) Mohamed Fadhil. (Mayor of Mosul.) Abdul LatifjI'asha al Mandil (leading merchant of Basrah). The remaining nine include a leading Christian from Baghdad and one from Mosul; a prominent Kurd of Sulaimaniyah ; the head of leading Shia family of Baghdad and two of the most influential Sheikhs among settled Shia tribes. It has not been possible to consult you in advance as it was important to act at the psychological moment, that is, when 1 had made sure of the co-operation of the Naqib. The advantage of using the Naqib was that it enabled me to include Saiyid Talib without making him President, a course which would have excited opposition in certain quarters. Please publish such portions of above as you think lit. Addressed Secretary of State, repeated India. XII.
