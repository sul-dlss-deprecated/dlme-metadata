August 1, 1883. Memorandum respecting the Conveyance of English Mails on the River Tigris. WE have no arrangement with the Turkish Government with regard to the conveyance of the English mails on the Tigris; hut I have ascertained at the India Office that on the 16th June, 1875, a contract was signed between the Secretary of State for India in Council and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company for the conveyance of mails between Bussorah and Bagdad. By that contract the Company engaged to maintain and keep in complete repair and readiness two good and efficient steam-vessels for that service, and to establish and maintain a line of communication from Bussorah to Bagdad and back three times in every month, unless prevented by political disturbances or other circumstances over which the Company had no control. They also engaged to carry all mails of the Government of India (including post-office stores and all articles sent by post, as well as the bags or boxes in which they were conveyed) which might be required to be conveyed on such voyages between Bussorah and Bagdad, or any of the intermediate places. The subsidy to be paid by the Secretary of State for India in Council for this service was fixed at 3,600/. a-year; but it was further agreed that, if at any future time during the currency of the contract the number of vessels 'permitted by the Turkish authorities to run ,, should be increased from two to three or more, the Govern ment should have the right of requiring the [1205]• i • q i4 n p of communication Company to maintain every from Bussorah to Bagdad an a .....luced week, and that the subsidy should e from 3,600;. to 2,400/. a-year. On the 23rd January, 1880, this las o the contract of 1875 was cancelled, and it agreed that a line of commumcatxon shou d he kept up between the ahove-meutioncd places and back once every week, for which the Company should be paid 3,600;. a-year. In this contract the Company engaged to keep in repair and readiness all such good and efficient steam -vessels as might be necessary for propei y maintaining such weekly line of communication. The other clauses of the contract of 187o were confirmed. The contract of the 16th June, 1875, expires on the 30th April, 1884. This, however, would appear not to have been the first contract entered into for the com eyance of mails between Bussorah and Bagdad, for Sir Arnold Kemball alludes to the subject m his Memorandum on the ' Dromedary Dak/' which he drew up on the 26th February, 1875. It may be mentioned that this postal service from Bagdad to Damascus was established about the year 1831-32, and that the Porte endeavoured to put a stop to it in 1875, on the ground that the authorization was originally given solely for the conveyance of the official correspondence with India, whereas it had been used for the conveyance of private letters destined for places within the Turkish dominions; but on Sir H. Elliot address ing a letter to Safvet Pasha, in which he said he was sure it could not be the wish of the Turkish Government to inflict such inconvenience as the stoppage of this post would entciil upon tlic merchants and others to whom rapidity and punctuality in the transmission of their corre spondence was a matter of impoitance, the practice would appear to have been jllowcd to continue. But with regard to the conveyance of mails by steamers on the Tigris, I am not aware that any such permission has been given by the Porte, nor is the India Office aware of any; but as a ' matter of fact, the Euphrates and Tigris Companyhave conveyed the boxes or hags containing the mails the same as ordinary goods. With regard to the question of the right of Messrs. Lynch to navigate the Tigris, I am not sure whether I made it sufficiently clear in any previous Memorandum that the Porte allowed Messrs. Lynch, in 1875, to replace one of their old steamers on the Tigris by a new one. I alluded to the fact in my Memorandum of the 27th March, 1881, hut I did not quote the words of Safvet Pasha's note to Sir H. Elliot. It was dated the 31st March, 1875, and ran as follows:— ' Le Ministere Imperial a re9u en son temps la note que votre Excellence a hien voulu lui adresser le 2 Juillet, 1874, relativement aux bateaux a vapeur de Messrs. Lynch et Cie. affectes au service de la navigation du Tigre. Confor moment au d6sir exprime par I'Ambassade de Sa Majesty Britannique, la Sublime Porte consent a ce que Tun des deux bateaux que Messrs. Lynch et Gie. emploient en vertu d'un Firman Imperial pour le service des passagers et des marchandises par le Tigre soit provisoirement remplacee par un autre, sans que le nombre des navires autorise par le susdit Eirman puisse etre augmente, &amp;c.'
