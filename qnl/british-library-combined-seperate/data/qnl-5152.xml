Most of the letters are from the Political Agency in Bahrain to the Ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa informing him whether the court will be held or not. Shaikh Hamad's replies confirm whether he will be attending the court sitting or not. In cases where Shaikh Hamad was unable to attend, the Agency sent letters to both Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al-Khalifa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa requesting them to attend the court sitting on his behalf.In general, the court was held on Wednesday of each week. However, cases were postponed on some occasions if they were not urgent and letters were sent to the Shaikh to inform him that there was no need for him to come to the court sitting.The main correspondence is between the Bahrain Political Agency, the Ruler of Bahrain (Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa) respectively, and Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain. Most of the file is in Arabic.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Courts</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00027b#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00027b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00027b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
