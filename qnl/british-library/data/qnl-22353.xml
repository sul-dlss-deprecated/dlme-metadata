No. C/965 Dated the 14th December 1940 I feel that what we now require Is a recreation ground on which matches, football, cricket, etc., can be arranged and the occasion utilised for inviting the younger Arabs and Persians to come either as spectators or players. V'e should then have the opportunity of getting to know them in somewhat informal surroundings. It would be necessary of course to provide chairs and refreshments, i.e. tea, etc. I know that in other places I have been in this worked very well and I am anxious to start it here. There is a piece of ground on the way to Jufair which the State can let me have at a nominal rent like other recreation grounds nearer the town, and this I could arran ^e to have levelled and prepared for about K 500/-. There would be some running expenditure for transport of chairs to the place and ^ack a^aln and for provision of tea, cakes etc., but ve could probably do this on about fe 50/- a month. I have discussed this with Dr. Holmes and Howes and they both entirely agree that this is one elusive way in which to gain contact with these rather iQQV&amp;i&amp;e sons of the notables whom we already know. I think that a move like this is really very necessary and the sooner we could proceed with it the better, as I am told that many of these young men spend their leisure time in reading clubs imbibing wron^ ideas from outside literature. I feel anxious therefore to get on terms with them and also to introduce them to the Navy and to other British residents here so that they may not feel themselves excluded from acquaintance with the British. I believe that you are in agreement with the object T have in view and will therefore /- The Hon 1 ble Lieut-Colonel C. G. Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buahlre.1 i u - 2 - therefore carry on v/ith trying to get the ground prepared as far as funds permit me which is not very far. But If you could very kindly obtain some financial assistance from Government both for this and other purposes of a propaganda nature It would, I think, be well worth It from the point of view of the Government of India. If I could have a lump sum of money for expenditure on propaganda purposes it would make a number of desirable projects possible. Amongst them is the entertainment of local people to cinema exhibitions by the Publicity Officer in one of Uie Agency rooms which I hope to be able to do when the Publicity Officer is given &lt;v a proper cinema nachine, which again will entail,certain amount of expenditure on entertainment which 1 at present am unable to afford without financial assistance.

Publicity Officer is however without cinema and the one fortnightly news reel offered by Middle East seems inadequate. Perhaps His Majesty's Government night be approached to place at our disposal adequate sum for purchase of standard cinema and for hire of suitable films direct from distributors in India. P. If sanction reaches Bahrain by January 1st equipment can be obtained at nearly 50^ saving from the United States of America. A grant of Fs 15,000 for this purpose and for hire and purchase of films should suffice in first instance. 3. Films offered by Middle East seem inadequate and performances might consist of news reel, propaganda film and full length film of pro-British tendency. Ministry of Information might also be asked to s end a good supply of war films for use by Publicity Officer. Government of India may have a number of these in their possession v/hich could be sent at once. - Political - Copy to Publicity Officer i \( 1Ir O l- ^ ^' • /\ v ' ' * c Telegram 'Q' Political Resident, Bushire.

I feel that the surroundings in which a film is shown can either add to or detract from its value to a certain extent and Inasmuch as the gency represents the centre of British influence in Bahrain it would, I think, enhance the value of these films if they were shown here rather than in a building owned by an Arab merchant, which is also the place where all kinds of o^her common films are bein^ shown. Prominent indi viduals still esteem it a great honour to be invited to the Agency and the occasions on which we cnn invite so many people are so few and far between that I am sure it would be a great pity to let such valuable opportunities pass.

While I was in Cairo last week I did my best to interest the Ministry of Information in the Middle East in taking a film of the Persian Gulf. The Ministry have a mobile film unit which has taken some excellent pictures and it was decided that the unit could probably come to the Gulf after operating in the Sudan in February or March next year. I was asked by Ryan who is the Controller in Cairo of the Ministry of Infor mation if I would put up a programme for the unit and make suggestions for the actual 'story' of the film. 3. Thsre is however no certainty that the unit will in fact be sent to the Gulf in the spring for ais I had reason to realize when in Cairo the Persian Gulf is very low on the list of Middle East priorities and any one of the Ovher countries of the Middle East with the possible exception of the Yemen would certainly be given preference over the Gulf. I therefore consider that we should encourage India to take the film. 4. Quite fortuitously I had an opportunity of talking to Bozman yesterday evening and he told me that India f s technique had very much improved but that he was surprised to learn that they would be able to spare a unit to travel round the Gulf. He asked me whether the offer had been made by the Information and Broadcasting Department or by some Military body. Urfortu- nately I was not in a position to obtain the papers at that time and was therefore unable to tell him that the suggestion came /from The Hon^ole Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I .E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain.the External Affairs Department, However, from what Bozman said It appears that there is no certainty that we shall get the unit from India and before we tell the Middle East that we do not want them I suggest that we ask the External Affairs Department whether they can guarantee that the pictures will be taken in the spring. 5. Having no experience with scenario or script writing I find it very difficult to understand exactly what is required but I will outline a few subjects the photographing of which will I think be profitable not only to the Gulf but to India as welll^ (a) A scenic short showing tribal dances, hawking, picturesque town and desert scenes in Kuwait, on the Trucial coast, and in Muscat territory. (b) A story short describing the pearl fisheries from the actual diving to local dealing in Bahrain and on to the Bombay pearl market and the treasures of Indian princes. Scenes of the divers' home life, brokers 1 dealings, and the work of the Majlis-al-Ghaus could be introduced. (c) A trading film starting with the construction of dhows at Kuwait to their loading with dates in the Shatt-al^ Arab and their voyaging to Indian ports to discharge their date cargoes and reload with Indian goods. Scenes could be taken at Kuwait, at sur, in Karachi, in Bombay, and in Calicut from where most of the wood for the vesseb is obtained. Scenes of Aden, Zanzibar, and the Red Sea showing Kuwaiti or Suri vessels could be woven into the story. This is a very broad outline bub if the External Affairs Department is favourably impressed then I will be perfectly prepared to endeavour Co sketch a detailed story showing the actual scenes to be shot for one or all of my three suggesticns Yours sincerely, •H* D.O.

ADDRESS BY BRIGADIER CLAYTON. C.B.E.Conference of Post Officers, October, 1^44 SECRET /?/?. — ^ , , ADDRESS BY BRIGADIER CLAYTON, C.B.E. ys* Muuf eutu. 4, ( CO vering Item XI, papers 1 and 22 of the Conference) fa t • It is frequently said that when you are on the crest of // o /dfyy victory you can put across anything you like, more or less. In 1918 v/e had just defeated the greatest Empire that the Middle East had ever known, and we defeated it single-handed. In Egypt in 1919* in Iraq in 1920, we had serious trou ble, and the French had the sane in Syria in 1921, 1923 and 192?, and the reason is that when we are on the crest of the wave of victory, so to speak, it is the tine at which all theso smaller peoples think that we aro going to make final decisions and thoy got in with their claims at once. There is another point as regards the difficulties with immediate post-war periods. During a war, political crises are not desperately acute because you can always plead the exigencies of the war for staving them off. In fact, I think personally that Sir Harold MacMichael's tour as High Commissioner was, except for the first year, in some ways one the easiest tours there has b^en, because any political Hdestion could be postponed owing to the prosecution of the war# Once the war is over in Europe is becomes difficult to plead this convincingly. During the war, except for the Iraq trouble in 194-1, we have had very little cause for anxiety from a political point of view, I speak from personal knowledge as I have been re sponsible for watching the Middle East politically since 1940 and have never had really a moment's serious anxiety. For example, we have never had a single major case of sabot age in the Middle East, I wonder v/hat the reason is? Was it blind faith in our victory, or determination to be on the winning side? If so, it must have needed very strong faith in 1940, 1941 and 1942. I personally like to believe that it is because they think that we stand for something better than the Germans and that they like us better. I remember meeting in October 1939 Saadullah Jabri and AdiX Aralan, two of the most implacable anti-French Syrians one can fina. They said to me, 'Quite frankly, we want to see the backs of the French in Syria and we would like to see your backs in Palestine, But for this war,we aro whole-heartedly with you both against the Germans,' I believe they were genuine. It is often stated that the Arab is a materialist without ideals, and only wants the fruits of office. This is not true. If it were true, the President of the Syrian Republic could have enjoyed the fruits of office for the last twenty-five years instead of spending most of them in exile. The same may be said of many leaders in Egypt or even in Palestine, With regard to the actual problems. First of all, there has taken place in the last fortnight in Cairo an event which is going to have a powerful effect on many of the political problems of the Middle East. That event is the holding of the Arab Unity Conference at Alexandria, I have been an un repentant Pan-Arabist in my beliefs for the last twenty-five years. I believe that some form of it is inevitable; I be lieve that it is good for the Middle East in the long run and therefore good for us. But it may, in some of its aspects V. ^ •,,and/•• 2 •• and results, prove a thorn In our side. It is quite possible to ieaa and guide the League which the Conference has brought Into existoriGe; they are asking for leadership • and assist ance, Opposition will not danp it down but merely turn it against us, Ar ? b fiT A t ca ? e t0 th0 fore ai'ter Mr. Eden»s pFGclanation in 194-1, quite a lot of people have been setting j o; ^ l suc ^ 1 i^oas as one kingdon, federation4 etc,, n u rJV lnpilan ^ ly ^ knocking these ninepins down and saying that such things are impossible. In actual fact, there has never recently been in the minds of any of the leaders any an yJ^itary state or even of a federation. What they hoped to achieve was some form of association, and this is what it looks as though they have achieved. As regards the decisions of the Conference, they affect, • 5 oun ^ies that have adhered to it f but probably r,or, of i 2^ J?, future » tho resolutions on the Leba non and Palestine are likely to be the most in the public eye. ^anese question is affected in two ways. Firstly, a resolution was passed to the effect that the in- aependence of the Lebanon within its existing frontiers is T*h« g T v! th 5 s Jg nato r^s to the Protocol, since they ^ e mu4 0 declarod their policy of independence a ^ a t the other States are not going to Suf ? £ upon th ? tehanon unless, and this is only implied the Lebanose again submit to French political domination, in ^ Wi i 1 insider themselves at liberty to try to detach the Hoslem territories from the Lebanon. ma** ^resolved that no State among the signat'oriec ? reat y which is prejudicial either to the in- Lealuo' Thl$ Or . to ? hos £ of an y onG nenber of the resolution is almost certainly ained at the pos- 4-2 trea ty bolng concluded with the French, which is a w*?™ a 4-F r f Qged and Pre-eminent position. This nvfir question to-day in the Levant States, and one over which we are most likely to becone ourselves involved. Vit.Jh 0 e* a y c Sald i: hat J sub J oct to the independence of the cSZ?? States, we freely admit the pre-eminence of France in nat ^ 0 ? s * This was affirmed by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on September 8th 1941 in a in vhich he said. 'We admit that insofar as aS ? n 5tion has a privileged position, that position will ^ Frenoe. ' He went on to say thai he hoped for a i? S concluded between the French and the Syrians on the lines of our treaty with Iraq. on wn-v, ? ren 2l2 2 re Pressing very hard indeed for a treaty rBn^ai e r- st ? t0S ' They claim that it was provided for in it Is neoaa^^ ii? ati ? nS 4.J n 1941 1 and now asse rt that of termination of the Mandate, m point of say nothin 8 abo ut tho termination nan ^ ato a s being in any way tied up with a treaty, and 1041 Catroux in a letter which he wrote on June 23rd spoke of a treaty to regularise relations, but he said that in order to conclude such a treaty it was first of all ririn^of tho utont £ eva S, t ^etes should be withdrawn from the regime of the Mandate. Tho Syrians and Lebanese flatly refuse if thov I Privileged position to anybody, though I think that +2 agr ee to do so they would prefer to give it to n c'o £ er u 8 r ? a ® on t0 believe that both the Americans and the U.S.S.R. have stated that they will not recognise the pre-eminence of any country in the Levant. •..Opinion/Opinion in Syria is solid agr.inst any treaty. Opinion in tho Lebanon is a little noro divided. It was considerably divided until the action of the French on Novenber 11th of last year, when they arrested tho Lebanese Cabinet. That action caused considerable reaction and produced an imediato reaction over the whole Arab world; even the Sultan of Lahej sent a telegram of protest without any pronptinc at all. Furthernoro ? the Christian connunities are being don- 5i(iorably propa^andod to stir up their fears that unless they seek the protection of sone v/estern power, for instance France, they will be absorbed by Syria. It was to counter this propaganda partly that this resolution was passed. The P.renier of the Lebanese Republic nade a public declara tion and had it confirmed by Parlianent, just before he cane the Conference, stating that the boundaries of the Leban on would be maintained. Als^, quite recently the Maronite Patriarch and the Greek Orthodox Patriarch both sent letters to the * President of the Lebanese Ptepublic stating that they were strongly opposed to any treaty that would tie the hands of the State before the Peace Conference; that they wished the State to go to the Peace Conference completely free from any treaties. It is rather significant because the Haronite Patriarch has always been rather inclined to stand for the lesser Lebanon, but ho has come over. If within those two states the French do succeed, with help and connivance from us, in re-establishing themselves, or should they attempt an armed coup, even if we remain com pletely neutral, I think it would have a shattering effect on our position in Iraq and in Palestine, and in fact over the whole Arab world. As regards the future between the two States, there is always the possibility of a certain pressure from tho Syr ians to got back the Syrian Irridenta, namely, the four Cazas and the Port of Tripoli, A groat deal will depend on how the Lebanon runs its own show. It is not very good at tho moment5 if it becomes very inefficient there may be a uove on the part of some of the Moslems in the Forth Lebanon to go to Syria, but I do not think that is going to happen In the period in which we are at present interested. i think this Protocol has removed that danger for a very considerable time. I think the success of the Lebanon and the retention of its existing frontiers is of importance to the whole of the Middle East, The State is fairly evenly balanced as regards its various communities and confessions. Actually, the figures work out with about 25 per cent of the total being Ilaronites and Catholics, 25 per cent Greek Orthodox, 23 per cent Sunni Moslems, 24 per cent Shia Moslems and the balance Druses. The latter, although representing only a small proportion, are always quite capable of looking after themselves. It provides a balanced state amongst various •..confessions/11 confessions and creeds 'which, if it works well end retr.ins Its present frontiers in the present proportions, ni^ht well provide an exanple for minority questions in the rest of the Middle Erst, and I think it nir'ht easily provide the solution. There is another point about it too, that in its present 'boun daries it is an Arab ritatc» If it wore reduced to a Maronite Mountain it would becone once again nerely a bastion of IHurope and it v ;ould be very nuch handicapped in a role which I think it nay well fill now of providing a channel through which Western thought, and the best Western thought, apart fron the naterialist froth on the top, can pass to Arab ninds» But that depends on its renaininc Arab, otherwise it will not be accepted. On Palestine there is a ^ood deal to be said. The inne- &lt;!tlrte period after the '.European war is likely to present us v/i Ji one rather grave crisis v;hich nay provoke a clash. Once the Dardanelles arc open and the Black Sec coasts are free, it is novo than possible, and even probable, that lar^e numbers of Rounanian, Bulgarian and Hungarian Jev/s that have been able to escape will be shipped to Palestine, Of the 75,000 allowed in the White Paper there are only round about sone 15,000 left. I would not swear to these figures, but I think that is about it. They ni^ht easily ship then in throe ship-loads - and they have cot the ships. Once that quota is passed, the authorities in Palestine are faced with a problen. If we let then in, we have torn up the White Paper and shall have trouble with the Arabs. If we stop then, we shall have trouble with the Jews* V f hat the solution is I do not know. The Phite Paper renains the present public policy of His Majesty's Governnent, but they are under very heavy pressure In ..'Jierica and in Bn^land. The two ./icrican parties, as you know, have published their party progrannes for the conplote cbandonnent of the Vliife Paper and the establishnent of a Jew ish state in Palestine. The Labour Party in England presented a resolution to the Labour Conference (which did not sit - therefore that resolution has not yet been discussed) not only to establish a Jewish state in Palestine but to transplant the Arabs fron that State to Iraq and 3yria, Fron the point of view of publicity or propaganda, it is hard to see what can be d^ e. Two parties are doing their own - one side very efficient the other side not so efficiently; in fact the other side is rather conspicuous by its absence of propaganda. All one can say is there are the nakinjs in Palestine of a packet of trouble and it is a problen over which a groat nany are- scratching their heads and no-one has found a solution yet. The -whole fact of the natter is that the Palestine problen at the nonent is not situated in Palestine really, but in Washington and London, and that is where the key of the solu tion is and it will be settled there eventually. Iraq is very closely interested injDcth Palestine and Syria, and it was the Palestine question nore than any other one question which put then in the franc of nind which pro duced ^ the Revolt of 1941. I believe it still to be a burning question, and I do not think it is right to say that it only .,,interests/there but not in the sane proportion, rhat tho future is going to be one cannot say. V.'hat they want is an independent status. They want independence with a close alliance with Great Britain. What they are asking for and what the vast Majority would like is soncthing encroaching a nandato with the status of Transjordan; thoy would accept a considerable amount of British advice and control, rhether wo shall ci vo ^ to then or whether wo shall take it on I have not tho slightest idea. I do not know that it would bo a paying pronosition. It would cost us noney 9 but it ni^ht be worth while for tho well-boing conorally of tho Middle East. What happens to Cyronaica and Tripolitania is coing to have a considorablo effect on tho future of the Arab world, because if one of these becones independent states it is r 'oing to bo very d:lff:.cult for the French in Tunisia, Morocco and Alciors. It opens up a very big vista to which certain poodle in *is country have their eyes fully open. They deserve well fron us. Tho Cyrenaicans. as I say. In tho beginning of June 1940 were the first to rally to us and have boon very loyal over since. Tho nain problen is not so nuch whether, but to what extent we are prepared to take connitnonts thore and how much wo want. V*o nay want an aerial base thoro. IVhen those were in onony hands it npoved a gro^t nuisance to us, I think that nore or less covers tho Arab countries, and now there is the question of Russia. I do not think thore is any need to oonsider it a bogey. I do not believe fron the evidence that I have been able to see so far, that Russia has any very definite nlans. There are no signs of any dofinito plans, but there are r;any signs that she is taking every opportunity of increasing her influence and prepared to use any instrunent that cones to hand. Tho Important thing perhaps fron our point of vioW| and certainly fron the point of view of tho Post Officer and propaganda, is tho attitude of tho people of tho country. Tho Greek Orthodox Catholics in Damascus rang thoir bells for an hour after the news of the fall of Stalingrad and tho Grook Orthodox Patri. rch, an Arab who was educated for eleven years f&gt;t Merv in Russia, when ho.heard of tho projected visit of a dolegatlon fron the Russian Church, was delighted. Tho Arnenion Church has just sent a representative down to enquire into various natters concerning tho Armenian Church in Syria and Falostlne and reports say that ho is quite openly sugcocting to Armenians that their future lies in Soviet Armenia, If the French try to recover their former position - if for oxamplo, they refuse to hand over control nf arned forces to the local govemnents , I think it is not at all beyond the bounds of possibility that those two states will say, 'There are hundreds of efficient, able, well-trained Russian generals •• we will turn to then for help.' I do not think they- 9 ~ i viar\t$ to! but It is a possibility t I have r.ot touched 'ersir, v/hich is really rather a partipular subject, and it is very difficult a^ein there to see mat is Going to crop ur). Ve have got to take decisions. There are all sorts of interests there. Fothin ' can ;;et array from the fact that northern Persia is foing to be tied to Tlussia, and Southern Persia will continue to look to a certain extent to India. Developnent of railvays rather alter this and nelo to tie Southern Persia uo to the Torth.

It was now believed that, by the Spring of 1945, the Iraqi Array would be in a position whore it no longer had to accept humiliation at the hands of the Kurds and would bo able to deal with any possible Kurdish insurr- oction. Incidentally, it mirht be difficult to prevent a strong and confident Iraqi Army from interveni.ig jhould there be troublu in Palestine or Sjria.

SIMPSON aft^r omphasiaing the unity existing between x^rab States on external political orobleas, referred to the ^^e.lwncss Ox the Oovernments of Syria and the Lebanon, and said that the support of a European power was essential in the present sta^o of development of the t'.vo states. At the present time the British wore popular and probably more accepto.ble than any other power f although Russian influence was notably incroasing. The French hB&amp;. boon spending largo sui'ic on propaganda, which had had soiuo effect among the Christian mii -ority, but nevertheless the general attitude towards the French was still v^ry hostile. The A?r.orioans # main interest ^/as commercial, and they had shown surprisingly little political activity. There was no doubt that attention w^s focussed on Britain, and it was realised that the futur , of the Levant depended largely on British policy.

Ki. HOLI-iE touched eriefly on the support which the - Zionists received froia abroad. lie considered th:.t support for the. Jewish cise from Britain itself would always oj more important than the soe/nirgly more active support which was received from the Unxted States. For example, the recent resolution of the Oritish Labour Party was more dangerous than /theu - 11 - the statements made during the American presidential campaign. It must be realised, however, that the Zionists received very considerable financial aid from the U.S. and also from South Africa. . 'P® CONTROLLER thought that the Arab case was not efficiently presented or sufficiently pressed in London. T^e Colonial Office had been fighting a lone battle to secure recognition of the Arab position in the Palestine problem, on which as a ivhole 'they had to take an objective view. The general pcpulacc wore conpletoly ignorant of the Arab case, though* they woro deeply, though sentimentally, Imoressed by the Jewish case. 3i&lt;IGADr5H CX^YTON observed that the Arab was extraordin arily bad at putting over his case. Part of the trouble was due, to the lack of competent personnel. There was an office in London dealing with publioity for ^rab affairs, but it was not efficient. LT»-COL. SCAIFE referred to Paper No» 1 (Democracy or Oonmunism ?) and emphasised the necessity for a positive statement of what we meant when we said that we stood for democracy. A democratic framework was meaningless without a motivating spirit. Without such a spirit democracy would be lit .le more than an empty word. Democracy depended on individual sensibility, but the sudden impact of western habits was tending to blunt that sensibility rather than foster it. It must be remeiabered that spiritual stimulus was obtained by western races through the senses, but the Arab received this stimulus through the discipline of his religion. The danger of this sudden indigestible impact of western culture was that it destroyed this discipline without replacing it with any fresh sot of ideals; and the result w s that thu Arab tended to d- generate into a pure materialst he felt that tins must be ta^cen into consideration when discussing proT&gt;aganda in the M .E.

ELAN OF PROPAGANDA FOR PERSIA . SECOND REVISION OF C HANNE LS. PAPER NO. 331A . This paper is based on information received up to the end of Ifoveniber, 1944- A. FIELD CONDITIONS. I. STAFF &amp; ORGANISAT ION. Since the issue of the last Channels (Paper No. 297), there has been a general expansion'of the work of the M .O .I# in Persia, both in the capital and in the provinces, and considerable changes have taken place in the organisation of the Public Relations Bureau in Tehran. Following the sudden death of Mr. S. L. Childs early in 1943, Mr. C. A. G. Savidge was appointed Director of the Bureau, with the rank of First Secretoc^ of the Embassy. Mr. Savidgo was recalled by the Government of India and in July ^iVf Lt .-Col• D. P. S. Graham was appointed Press Attachfe. In Appendix 'A' will bo seen a complete list of the staff in Tehran, as known here at present. Appendix 1f C' shows the administrative set-up in Tehran. The Bureau is run in seven separate sections, at the head of each of which is a British Head of Section ranking as an Attach^ of the Embassy. These Divisions arc: 1. Persian Press Section (Press Attache's Office) with its attached Persian Publications Sub-Section. 2. Central Section with Registry and Accounting Office Sub-Sections. 3. Broadcasting Section. 4. 'Daily News' Section with Printing Office Sub-Section. 5. Visual Riblicity with Distribution Sub-Section. 6. Films Section. 7. Allied Liaison Section. Some scaling-down in these divisions is to take place very shortly. AccomraDdation is still in 'Victory House', but the increased volume of work has necessitated the leasing of four flats nearby to provide accommodation for the Bureau's activities. In 1943 a Packing Room and a Central Store were built, and this year a folding-room was added to the Printing Office. A bookshop (British Informatif^ Centre) and an Exhibition Hall have recently been rented in the main square of Tehran, and a cinema hall - the Akhbar Cinema - in the main shopping street is now in the hands of the Bureau. The Bureau acts in close and constant cooperation with H.M, Smbassy, of which it is in many ways an integral part. The senior staff oi the Bureau possess diplomatic status and on all matters of policy the orders of H .M. Ambassador are obtained. II. FINANCE . • In the approved budget for 1943 -4 (December-November) operational expenditure was estimated at £^9 f 008 and staff expenditure at_£67,593. Receipts in respect of the sale of films, photographs and publications was expectecT'to be £15,066. A budget for 1944-5 has been received, which shows that actual operational expenditure did not reach the amount budgeted in 1943'4» ^he new proposals arc less than the previously authorised estimates, but indicate actual expansion. Staff proposals shovv an increase due mainly to increased on account of cost of living, medical care and increments. The details of the budget are being examined, and, in the light of the scalin3 dovn described in paragraph I above, it is likely that final proposals on a reduced scale will be presented. A proposal to install printing machinery has been approved; this will involve capital expenditure of £7,125 on plant and recurrent expenditure of £750 yearly, against which it is estimated that thexc will be an offset of £^,893 annum in present recunert expn^^ture. P.T.O. .111 • V. r ORK IN TH E PRO VINCEo . Details of the activities of the Bureau outside Tehran are set out in Appendix 'B'. Provincial publicity activities have increased considerably during the past 18 months. Reading rooms, Display centres, Bookshops and Radio Halls have been established in each of the 12 Consular'areas, and this type of organisation has been extended in certain areas to cover the outlying towns and villages. These posts are supplied with material from Tehran by means of a courier lorry service. A peripatetic Regional Publicity Officer was attached to the Bureau; ho spent the greater part of his time touring in the remoter areas in order to promote and encourage local publicity activities. This post is now vacant, however, as well as two other similar posts for which Budget provision exists. TV. C2NS0HSHIP . The tripartite Persian, British, and Russian censorship to cover corres pondence and press messages is still operating: close contact between the Bureau and the British Censorship authorities is maintained. The effect of the Soviet censorship is that a certain proportion of British material is held up, and in some ca.ses destroyed by the Russians. V. GOivIMiJNI CxiT IONS . Publicity material taken from London to t he Middle East is routed through Cairo: the time taken from Cairo to Tehran by rail is normally five weeks, material sent by sea to a Persian post takes considerably longer. Communications with India, have improved by the introduction of a regular lorry service operated by the Bureau between Tehran and the Zahidan railhead. Air services to and from Persia are better: a regular thrice-weekly ba.g service connects Tehran with London and with other posts in the Middle East. Correspondence by air takes approximately 10 days to reach London. Radio ser vices are on the whole satisfactory, but cable communications are less efficient and are subject to considerable delays. Internal communications are, in a country like Persia, not easy: sea and overland services are slow, and rail and road transport leave much to be desired. The courier service has greatly accelera.ted the deliveries, of material between posts in the provinces: it operates as follows fa) Tehran-Isfahan (Shiraz)-Yezd-Kerraan (Bandar Abbas)-Zahidan. (b) Tehran-Meshed-Birjand (Zabul)-Zahidan. (c) Tehran-Tabriz-Hamadan-Kermanshah. (d) Tehran-Ahwaz-Khorramshahr (Bushire). As well as facilitating the distribution of publicity material these services play a part in supplying the general needs of British Consulates. VI. REPORTING . Monthly reports on the general course of provincial publicity are received from the Consulates. Recently t7;o-monthly reaction reports have been sent to Tehran. These have indicated the success or failure of particular lines of propaganda, and the results are collated perioddically and reported to London, Cairo, and the Government of India. P.T.O.- 3 - CHANNELS. I. RADIO . (a) Field Conditions . Broadcasting is, in Persia, a fairly satisfactory publicity channel, though the lack or poor quality of electric power in the provinces discourages listening on a large scale. The Bureau owns a small number ot radio sets in various parts of the country (see Paper 297, page 4# Section V); the maintenance of these sets is the responsibility of the Bureau. No proper facilities fbr maintenance exist, however. Where the electricity supply is particularly bad or non-existent, battery sets are used, relays of allied broadcasts in Persian are given in conjunction with the reading rooms set up in the provinces, and sometimes in public places on loud-speakers. Application is being made for further sets in order to maintain an efficient and widespread relay service of this type. W Local Stations . Excellent relations exist between the Bureau and the Persian^News and Broadcasting Department; assistance in maintaining equipment end in securir^ supplies is given from time to time to the Persian authorities. cO 1 ,000 is paid yearly for special broadcasts. Reception in the provinces of Radio Tehran has been poor on the whole, but with the installation of new transmitters it has improved recently. Half-an-hour daily is now allotted to the Bureau for British and Allied broadcasts on Radio Tehran (MW 2kw and SW 28kw and T^kw) * A small proportion oi this time is handed over to the Allies in Tehran for their own purposes. It ispropDsed to relinquish this half-hour in the near future, and the matter is under consideration. The Bureau's programmes are made up in two parts to appeal to 'popular caftb or street audiences as we'll as to a more serious, intelligent part of the ^ P population: little time is devoted to the dissemination of world news, .as the B.B.C. serves this field adequately. 'The Voice of Britain' concentrates mainly on commen taries and talks related to recent news items. Guest speakers, prominent Persian and British personalities, broadcast fairly frequently, and a lady announcer introduces talks for somen. The new schedule, which was introduced in August, has enabled uhe Bureau to 'lighten' its programmes. They now include one radio play, one short story, and one radio feature every week: a talk on new films is given every other week, alternating with talks on English and Persian books. L.T.S. material, scripts and records, is received in satisfactory quantities; it serves as background for radio scripts and occasionally is reproduced in the local press. Material for broadcasts is prepared locally in great quantities and is received from Cairo. (c) B.B.C. broadcasts in Persian ire beamed from London at 10.30 - 10.45 G.M.T., and 16.00 - 16.30 G.M.T. These programmes, cover world news, features, talks and music. They are widely listened to throughout the country, and reception, where'local conditions are reasonable is fairly good. Recently there has been some evidence of outside interference, sometimes of a serious charactelr. (d) iill-India Radio broadcasts from New Delhi in Persian from 1 / 18.15 G.M.T. daily. The programmes consist of world news, talks, music, end 1caoures with an Indian angle. These broadcasts are not very popular, mainly owing to poor reception, but also the prejudice existing in Persia against India.^ The qualify of the programmes and the reception is, however, improving, and with them the scopo 01 the programmes is widening. Both London and the Govemi ient of India are supplied jy tr.c ui'j.-u &gt;.i ^ 1.0-tcrial of local interest, jid are ,':c^t u^ to date v .ith listeners' reactions. B, P.T.O.(e) Reporting .

Reports on the reception of B.B.C. and New Delhi programmes in the provinces are sent to London end New Delhi. H. PRESS &amp; PHSSS SERVICE S. ( Cl ) Fie 1:1 conditions . a11 matters connected with the local Pe^ian Press are hrjidled by the Persian Press Section of the Information Bureau unde- the Press .\ttach6, Miss Lambton. The price of newsprint is high in Persia, stocks vary according to the transport situation, and printing is very expensive. About 80 tons of newsprint per annum are needed by the Bureau; this and stocks of printing ink are received from Cairo end adequate supplies are at present in stock. On the whole the attitude of the Persian press has been cooperative during the past year; most of the newspaper editors have shown readiness to publish material distributed by the Bureau. Copies of a daily summary of the local press are still made by the Persian Press Section, and are sent to London, Cairo, and New Delhi. (^ ) ) Local Press . A number of persons hold licenses to publish newspapers who at present are not doing so. As,' however, many newspapers are financed entirely by blackmail, the possession of a license to publish is in itself used as a dangerous weapon to threaten opponents; this tendency has been so general tha.t during the past few months there are signs that the policy is beginning to lose its attraction, though the soberer newspapers do not yet enjoy such a good circulation as those which are devoted to well-spiced abuse. 'Ittila'at' has the largest circulation and publishes mainly 'straight' soberly presented news: the editor lias, however, other news-sheets at his disposal in which he can attack his enemies and thus maintain th^tone of his officia.1 newspaper. Their policies are fluctuating. 'Sadayi', 'Iran', and 'Sitara', have been the only consistently pro-British newspapers; inost others have allowed the news of the moment to dictate their policy from day to day. The same influences affect their attitude towards domestic affairs end groups, policies and alignments are fluid and change with remarkable rapidity.' 'Rahbar' and 'Mardun' have followed a consistently pro-Russian policy and are popularly -considered to be to all intents and purposes Russian organs, % An analysis of the Persian p&gt;res3 is given in Appendix 'D'. A detailed list of the provincial newspapers is not possible to compile; they have but slight influence and tend to be influenced almost entirely by the Tehran press. Subsidies are not paid by the Bureau in cash to the local press; indirect assistance is, however, given to selected newspapers in the form of supplies of newsprint and payments for advertisement and notices# Similar practices are resorted to by the Government, the court and the U.S.S.R. P.T.O.(o) • News Agencies . 1. Reutei^s. Porcereuter and Globereuter sorvices are used for the 'Tehran Dai3y News' (see below 'Local Production').

A.F.I . sends two daily messages to Agence Pars. 4. U.S. Agencies . U,P. has tried during the past year to set up in Persia, so far with no success; an attempted agreement with the Agence Par's failed, as no pick-up was able to be arranged. U.P. and O.W.I, are monitored regularly by the Bureau. (d) Empax material sent on: i. 2.

This material is used in locally produced bulletins and magazines, and is distributed to local Persian newspapers and serves as background for programmes from Radio Tehran. (f) Local Production . All local printing is now carried out by the Bureau owing to the unsatisfactory service and the exorbitant charges of the Tehran printing offices. The ''Victory House Press' turns out both English and Persian publications and by this means a great saving in expense has been effected. A proposal to install modern equipment has been approved, as the former hand-sotting arrangements were economical neither in time nor labour• •j # 'Tehran Daily News' .has replaced the News Bulletins and Daily ^ News Summary described in Paper No. 297« It has a cir'culation ol c.bout co^ieo in Tehrai/^md the provinces, is the only English-language paper in the country and appears every day in the week except Saturday (three times weekly in a four page edition and three times as a two-page broadshe&gt;t). It is composed of articles on current world news, feature articles.and a small number of items of local interest. It is sold to the public at a price of one rial (l.9d.). The cost of printing, rent of machinery, ink, paper, cliches, and wages of compositors is £10,000 por annum, and receipts in the budget year 1943-4 were £6,000. It is widely read by British and Allied military personnel in Persia, as well as being of particular value in main taining interest in the English language and point of view .among Persians. It nas recently gained an increased number of Persian readers, who now number about 1 ,uuu a 2. Persian News Commentary. (Tafsir i Khabarta-i-Jahan) appears weekly. It has a circulation of 10,000 and is distributed free to^ individuals^ in all parts of Persia: the commentary is particularly popular among the intelligentsia and its articles are often reproduced in the local press. It is mainly composed of subjects relating to the projection of Britain and the war, although news and current events also appear in its pages. 3. Children* s Newspaper (Nov Nafcalan) consists of 8 pages and caters for children from 10-16 years of age. Distribution (18,000 copies sold fortnightly) is confined to schools. The paper has been in existence for about one year, its cover varied subjects such as the war, British institurtions, school life in Britain and the Dominions, serial stories translated from standard English authors, bi-lingual articles and an amusements page. It has been a very great success. 4. Women's Magazine (Alemi Zanan). A monthly; 4 issues have been already prepared; approximately 3&gt;000 copies are sold each month. The magazine i i designed to educate Persian women in citizenship and to interest t.em in the activi ties of women in Britain and other countries. P T 0III.

The demand for most of this material Is on the increa.se, and a large field remains to be explored before saturation point is reached. 'Britanski Soyuznik' (500 copies) and other publications in Russian are supplied to Russian personnel in Persia and are much sought after. .n.n increased quantity of publicity matter in French, Polish, and Czech is also received and eagerly read by Allied nationals who come to get their copies, P,T.O.lh - 7 - (b) Books. looks in English, especially those dealing v;ith British life and institutions .and biogr- hips of v;ell-kno-n personages ore ^elcoued by the intelligentsia.

A good deal of the material formina these displays is received from London and Cairo, but is supplemented on a considerable scale by locally produced pictorial matter. Exhibitions illustrating 'war subjects and the xjrojection of Britain, consistin •~of~250-300 photographs and a number of coloured posters are shown xor a nonth at the British Information Centre and then circulated m the provinces. Radio and Press publicity are coordinated to give special prominence to tha subject 01 the exhibition, and they are known to have a wide popular appeal. Window Displays. Pour large windows are available for displays in Tehran and others in the provinces are at the disposition of the Bureau. An average of / large photo raphs surrounding a central coloured motif are prepared to celebrate anniversaries or to illustrate contemporary events, e.g. /jiglo-Soviet-Peisi .n irw j, the Battle of Britain, Sicilian campaign. Copies of these displays are prepared simultaneously and sent on a fixed provincial circuity fb} Photographs. The Bureau has a library of over 10,000 photographs, all of which are classed 'cold'. A serious obstruction to the effective use of these Dhotosraphs is the bottleneck caused by the time taken in preparing and checking tnc captions. Radio pictures have recently begun to come through to Tehran, but no infor mation as to the use that is being made of them is as yet available. Lar^-e supplies of photographs of the battle fronts arc received regularly from Cairo, and coloured enlargements are sent from London. They are used for press distribution, displays, and are placed on sale. P.T.0.( c ) Mnps , cove-in^ the war theatres have been prepared in advance by the Bureau. They are in English and in Persian, and many have been distributed in the provinces. ■ ..arge coloured niaps have been produced in Tehran — a good exanple was one measuring 200 cm. by 1ZfO cm. used in a window display to illustrate the liberation of Europe. (d) Posters are received in bul-c from Cairo end high class coloured posters from London; The average supply from London varies between 300-30,000 copies monthly according to tue popularity of the subject: London produced posters are never topical, but treat subjects of lonr-term interest. V. FILMS * (a) Field Conditions . Outside Tehran are found very few jood class cinemas, but in spite 01 this Persians throughout the country are becoming more and more film- minded. No local film industry exists, and chiefly old films of 0 U.3. origin have been seen up^ to now, though modern ones are beginning to appear: Russian films take second place, out British fili.is are a lon^ way behindhand. This important chanrf^. is receiving close attention. Close and cordial relations exist between the Films Section of the Bureau -.nd local cinema proprietors: assistance has been given on many occasions in obtaining films and maintaining equipment • It has recently been agreed that theJVI # 0.I. will facilitate the purchase of ten pairs of projectors by Mr. Jacobson - a local cinema-chain proprietor. This transaction is p. costly one and is especially important as it is the first occasion on which British projectors have been used in Persia, hitherto a German field. The 'Akhbar Cinema' is owned by the Bureau: it is equipped -I hold 330 pesons and regular daily performances are given from 3*30 p.m.-9 p.m., the programne s are made up of a newsreel, short, cartoon, and comicfeature films arc only occasionally shown. Special -film performances are given now and again in 'Victory House' - in the hall in winter and out of doors in summer. (b) N ewsreels . Five copies of War Pictorial News are received weekly from Cairo and five copies of Movietone News from London] the commentaries of these films are in Persian, A small revenue is obtained from hiring newsreels to local exhibitors and this plan is also adopted by the Russians; U.S. authorities, on the »9ntrary, issue one print in French of United News at intervals free of charge. A^Tinterchange of British and Soviet newsreels has been arranged with the local Russian authorities. ( c ) Shor ts. Supplies are received from london and Cairo; every suitable short made by the M.0.1. has been sent to Pe sia, but it is reported from Tehran that difficulties have been encountered in making up and maintaining varied and inter esting i:rogrammes for 'Akhbar' and for Mobile FiLm Shows. The modernised version of 'Grass' has been the most popular documentary in Tehran and the provinces, a few shorts dubbed in Russian have been successfully shown in the Soviet-occupied zone, but supplies of these have now ceased. The British Council have sent educationa.1 ^ and cultural films dubbed in English and Persian in good numbers. Requests for films to be shown to audiences of children will be satisfied as soon as suitable films for this purpose have been made. 'Desert Victory' has been one of the nost successful shorts exhibited in Persia. (d) Features , Pew have been sent to Tehran. 'Mrs. Miniver', imported commercially, achieved considerable results. ( e ) Carto ons Sc. Comi cs are exceedingly well-received throu^hour Persia: during 19^+4 seventeen comics have been sent to Cairo, and it is expected tha.t they will be available very shortly for Middle East territories. P,T.0,- 9 - (f) Non-Theatrico.l Exhibition, fleet of 7 mobile cinemr. vans equipped with 35 nim. pr-ojectors is maintained by the Bureau; six of these are kept touring in outlying areas, and the seventh visits schools and other centres in Tehran.. Regular performances have been arranged in schools and colleges during the year .and the Bureau has maintained close cooperation with the British Cpuncil, and the Persian Minister of Education. Pour 16 mm. sound projectors owned by the British Council and s'even 16 mm. silent projectors (the property of the Ministry of Education on loan.to the Bureau for operation on their behalf) are maintained by the Bureau. The existing stock of films for showing on these van tours is improving. (g) Local Production . Some very successful newsreels and shorts have been produced in Persia by the M.I.M.E. cameraman assisted by the Bureau's Films Officer. VI, PERSONAL CONTACTS . Advantage is taken of opportunities for individual Anglo-Persian cooperation: formal parties take place periodically at 'Victory House'; at these a feature film is usually shown. In connection with the 'Children's Newspaper', veiy successful chil dren' s.^ilm parties for readers have been given at the Akhbar Cinema. Good relations exist between the Bureau's staff and the press representa tives of the Persian Government and of foreign missions to the capital. Some senior officers of the Bureau have visited M.I.M.E. and visits have been exchanged between members of M.O.I. London and the Bureau in Tehran. VII. CO OPS RAT ION WITH OTHER BODIES . (a) Propaganda to Allied Nations . This is an important feature of the Bureau's work. A special Section - the Allied Liaison under Mr. E. Sykes - is devoted to organising publicity towards foreign nationals in Persia. Special attention has Ijeen paid to fostering relations with the .Americans, Russians, Poles, and Czechs, and publicity material designed to meet their needs is distributed in increasing volume. A feature of the Bureau's work in this respect has been the organising of English lessons for Polish, Czech, and Russian nationals: this activity has now been handed over to the British Council.' Some 600 foreigners have benefited from the English classes instituted by the Bureau. Assistance is given to foreign communities in the publication of their bulletins by the provision of cliches, photographs, and articles. (b) The British Council - Relations betv/een the Bureau and the British Council are excellent. The Bureau gives much practical assistance to the Council and its ^stitutes at Tehran and Isfahan in such matters as the organising of exhibitions and performances of filjjis. Recently the Bureau undertook the publication for the Council of a textbook used in conjunction with a series of English Radio Lessons broadcast five times weekly for 15 minutes from Radio Tehran. Representatives of the British Council attend the weekly meetings of the Bureau's Heads of Sections in order to coordinate the activities of the two organisations. (c) Army Public Relations . The Bureau works in close cooperation with officers of the Indian Arny Public Relations Units and provides them with considerable practical assistance. (d) Other Government Bodies . The Bureau helps to give publicity to material prepared by the Middle East Supply Centre. Close relations are also maintained with the U.K.C.C. who give assistance in the distribution of publicity material from their various centres in the country. (e) Commercial Firms . The distribution of films and reading matter in the important Abadan area, is carried out by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which has recently displayed a welcome interest in the Bureau's activities. Close contact is maintained with other British firms, such as the Imperial Bank of Iran.» r proparraiida Activities in the Provinces.

(3) HAI LAPM. This post publishes a daily cycle-styled news bulletin which is sold to some 500 subscribers. A reading room and display centre is located in the main street and a 'cr^fe close by is utilised for radio broadcasts. A feature of the publicity work at Ham dan is the locally organised addresses given over a microphone once a. week. This post shares the Kermarshah c ire ma van which tours the outlying villages. (4) ISF-'JIAIT. Isfahan posresses a well-equipped reading room with a win^y for displa.y purposes; in addition, a separate small exhibition hall is main tained in the main street. Recently a, bookshop has been taken over end converted into a publicity selling agency subsidised by the Bureau. Distribution of material is carried out on a wide scale. One of the Bureau's cinema vans is permanently located at Isfahan and is used for performances in the local schools and villages and at the British Institute. The Bureau's work is in charge of a British Officer attached to the Consulate. A daily cyclo-styled news bulletin is also issued. (5) SHIRAZ. This post has a reading rook and bookshop round which the local, publicity activities are centred. Local British Officers carry out dis tribution in outlying tribal cjreas and the post also publishes a daily bulletin in Persian. S- iraz shares a cinema van with Bushire. (6) BUSHIHE . publicity activity centres mainly round the very popular re a. ding room and club which is organised on a subscription basis. The club possesses a radie and a second reading room ha.s been opened in one of the la.rger villages nearby. Owing to the poverty in the area free dis tribution of periodicals is greater than in other districts. Bushire shares a cinema van with C'liiraz. P .T.O.A P P E N D I X JIG'.

Howes, who is now working in that Department as Deputy Secretary in charge of Foreign Publicity, is going down to Bombay to talk to the film people during Zmas week, and the idea is that a film unit should go out to the Gulf, say late in March, and go round with this script filming suitable scenes, staying on of course until the pearling season starts. I suppose they had better go first to Bahrain where they will be able to gfet in touch with Hickinbotham. Yours sincerely. Sd/- Olaf Caroe. LI The Hobble 5ir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf.'7 Tiki iWc-IxJ: GULF. Jand and palms sc ene . Shot of Has Musandira (mountains at I have no doubt that the immediate mental reaction to the words ' Persian Gulf' on the part of the members of the Indian Institute of International Affairs, as of other well-informed people, is aome comment on the climate of those sun-smitten and scantily-watered coasts; and even «f its most ardent devotees do not pretend that it is 'Fardaus bar-rTj-yi-zamin'. I do not want to open this paper with a discussion of that absorbing topic, the weather, but it may be of interest to see just how and why the Gulf enjoys its unenviable reputation. It has nobody but itself to blame, and the reason is the shallowness of its waters. Inside the narrow Straits of Kormuz, the Gulf rarely sinks below 50 fathoms. For miles along the mouth 01 Gulf; coast ( in particular over the great Pearl Bank) the soundings rarely'exceed 10 fathoms, and near the islands are great stretches which dry out completely at low tides. In fact, we may take the average depth of the thousands of square miles of the Gulf's waters to be something like the height of the India Jirch in New Delhi. One has fcnly to think of the effect of leaving a saucer containing a millimetre's depth of water to stand in the sun on a hot day. Picture yourself living at the end of the saucer, and you have the Gulf in July. 2. Well, I only opened this subject of the weather, because I want to draw conclusions from it. The point I am aim to bring out is that mankind needs strong reasons to induce him to live in so uncongenial a climate, accompanied by its brackish water and scanty vegetation, indeed, only where there is any break in the sandhills of the Arab side or the sun baked mountains of the Persian coast. The answer which I believe to be the truth is that the Persian Gulf has a unique appeal to adventurers. To live there is to enjoy a spaciousness of life which is unknown in more highly civilized and closely administered countries and for those engaged in commerce, there are many chances of quick and easy wealth, away from the harsh competition of their home countries.

The first merchant adventurer in these waters whose name will occur to everyone is the legendary name of Sinbad. Though legendary, he is actually representative of a former ( very much alive) class of Middle East' merchants. What fortunes his voyages down to the v/aters of the Gulf brought him, Sheherazad told better than I ever can. We cannot, of course, say for certain v/here Sindbad's enchanted islands lie. Much of his history bears the imprint of the tales of the universal longshoreman, who is the same all the world over; and some of his adventures are the exact counterpart of those with which Ulysses must have so often wearied Penelope, when after his wandering from fallen Troy, he at length regained his home at Ithaco. Sheherazad, it seems, owed her life, in part at least, to the genius of blind old Homer. It seems fairly clear that some at least of Sindbad's voyages were to the East African coast, to which and from which the dhows of Kuwait and Basra still ply on the seasonal breezes of the winter, returning to tks the Gulf for the great pearl dive of the summer, when the monsoon is blowing in the India Ocean and sailing crait cannot face the weather outside. Sindbad ( I am still using his name, though by him I mean the me reliant adventurers of Basra) iksngk undoubtedly also visited India, Ceylon and even further India-Burma, Malaya and Java. He may even have gone so far as China.-2- Perhaps here cut in Picture of a medieval galleon. iinimation on map. Omit in filming Shot of Muscat. Trucial Coast scenes Sea scene Muscat harbour 4. But after him the curtain of history fall again till fiuropean galleons sail in at the Straits of Hormuz, having rounded the Cape of Good Hope in the wake of Vasco da Gama. Then began the struggle of Portuguese, Dutch and English for the trade of the Gulf, for the favour of Pers ian Khans and princes, for the establishment of their factories ( agencies, as we should now call them). The details of that struggle I need not give. The significant thing for us is that the two main rivals based themselves on India; and the struggle passed slowly from a contest of i^ngland v/ith Portugal to a contest of Bombay with Goa. Incia, after her forgotten wave of expansion to the is lands which now are the jNetherlands East Indies, again began to look beyond the seas; and it was to the Persian Gulf that her eyes turned. Jask, Bandar .abbas, Bushire - all along the Persian coast the East India Coy. established its factoties; until finally in 1763, Basra became its chief trading establishment. The southern, or Arab, coast, as you see, was left neglected. The treasures of oil, which, aided by the xenophobic commercial policy of the late Shah of Persia, have in the last half-centujay swung the balance across the Gulf, still lay undreamed of below the surface. 5o Side by side with the urge to peaceful trade went responsibility for peace, health and safe navigation in the Gulf coasts and waters; and the next phase was the slow transference from the interests of a strictly commercial company to the wider outlook and developing policy of a Government. This started long oefore the transference of actual government in India from the Company to the Crown. Early in the 19th century, the Company appointed its Political Agents in Muscat ( and it is a tragic commentary on the devotion of these men, as well as on the Muscat summer, that three out of the first four die4 at their post, and now lie on the shore of a lonely little bay opposite the Political Agency, surrounded by mountains and accessible only by sea). 6o India's first great problem in developing her new field of trade was the suppression of piracy. Along the southern shore of the Gulf, formerly called the Pirate Coast, in the multitude of salt-water creeks lurked the Jawasimi corsairs - Qawasim, to give them their correct pronunciation. One by one, their strongholds were reduced until a final expedition was launched against Ras-al-Kiiaima ('the headland of the tent 11 - the name probably derived from a look-out post encamped on the end of the spit of land, past which ships must sail to enter the lagoon)o The pirates were crushed and the 'maritime truce' of 1820 signed by every Shaikh. ( From this truce the coast derives its present name of Trucial Coast, a rather more respectable title than the old 'Pirate Coast';o The Gulf was safe for India's trade from the hand of man. It is perhaps of interest to remark that a few years ago, a gold dinar of Kumayun's reign was dug up on the beach at Ras-al-Khaima, and was presented by the writer to the British ^iuseum. 7o After the ravages of man, the next enemy to be tackled was the stormy and uncharted sea, full of reefs, rocky islets, tide-rips and overfalls. To this, tafek the ships of the Bombay Marine, direct progenitor of the Royal Indian Tjavy, betook themselves, side by side with their sisters of the Royal Navy. Their names, with the name of every ship that has anchored in the harbour, are painted in white on the steep volcanic rocks that surround the port of Muscat. Above them flashes the modern light-house whicj^ with scores of other buoys and beacons, commenorates their achievement. Warships, cargo ships, and passenger ships have all written their names in this unique ' visiters' book.' French shipsi ■4 Shot of ship's name (close- up). Omit in film ing.

It was not enough to have peace for man on the high seas. Ke must have liberty on land also; and as the body ox treaties between tiie i^rab rulers and the Crown grew, each in turn outlawed the slave trade. They did not, of course agree to abolish domestic slavery; that was too deeply rooted in the custom of their states, and in fact it is not. even now certain that the house-born slave alv/ays desires his liberty, a story v/hich is a 'chestnut' in Gulf circles may perhaps be permitted here, ^n old man was talking to the Agency Surgeon in one of the Shaikhdoms and mentioned that he had a certificate to prove that he v/as the slave of so-and-so, granted him by the ' Baliuz'. ,l Bal]Luz'is the universal Gulf word for a Political Agent, probably derived from the Greek or Vasilevs, which was the title of the Genoese envoy in the 16th - 17th century at the Sublime Porte® Several people interrupted protesting that the 'baliuz' could not possibly have given him such a certificate. The old man flew into a rage. 'Your lieif I have a certificate that I am the slave of so-and-so, and he is bound to feed and clothe me'. Proudly he produced his manumission certificate with its crossed Union Jacks and the Political agent's signature that he was a freed man. 9o Furtively and spasmodically, a few slaves are still kidnapped, mostly from Persian Baluchistan, and run ashore to be taken to Ibn Saud's dominions and sold. The men who dabble in this trade have taken advantage of the pre occupations of the Royal Indian Navy and the Persian Gulf Division of the Royal Navy with more deadly foes, to revive a traffic which before the war was almost stamped out. In Bahrain, indeed, even domestic slavery has been formally abolished; but everywhere else where there is a Political Agent, nobody need ba a slave who chooses to apply at the Agency for manumission, and no-one from the Shaikh down ward dare disregard a manumission certificate. 10o After man* s freedom, his health, and the important task ( in a maritime society) of quarantine. All posts nov/ have doctors of the Indian Medical Department, who look after the British and Indian communities and their local servants, board ships to grant or refuse pratique, advise the rulers in urban hygiene and sanitation, and dlo magnificent charitable work among tJbe local populations. 11. Perhaps I have talked long enough about the impact of the Gulf of civilizing influences from without, and ought to have given attention earlier to the indigenous peoples of the Gulf. I do not propose to delve into ethnological history. The important thing to remember is that a navigable stretch of sea like the Persian Gulf is a bond of union between its two shores rather than a dividing barrier. Se we have a larg^ Persian trading community in Bahrain, and a considerable leavening of Persiais on the Trucial Coast. Similarly on the South Persian littoral from a point midway between Bushire and Lingah, down to and beyond Lingah itself, the coastal tribes are of Arab origin, speak Arabic, and have ' Shaikhs' instead of 'Khans' In this area, the Persian gendarme or customs official looks an outlandish stranger. Round Bushire itself are j ;u f if •••-4- Bahrain grave yard «. Nomad tribes migrating: flocks &amp; herds. the few tribes which are of purely Persian origin. In the hinterland of the coast, between Shiraz and Bushire, v /ander the C^ashqai nomads, their name derived from the Turkish Kachmak ( to run away ), because they split off from the Seljuk Turks; and further south, above Lingah, are the grazing grounds of the Khamseh, the five tribes v/hose Arabic name oetrays their racial origin. 12. The population is no less mixed on the Arab coast. Kuwait, indeed, with its close commercial links with the Bedu dwellers of the desert is nearly pure iirab. Bahrain has a Shia population called the Baharina ( the name is merely the itrabic ' broken plural' of Bahraini) who represent the original population which dwelt there before the $ax±g±M±x conquest of the island by its present rulers, the a 1 Khalifah-a sub-branch, originally, of the great Ajman tribe. It would be too tempting, and too commonplace, to bring in the familiar name of 'Phoenician' in describing their origin. However, south of the town of Lanama, the capital of Bahrain, is a vast area of tumuli, covering perhaps ten square miles of the island 1 s surface; a phenomenon which gives point to the gibe of old inhabitants, when asked what Bahrain is like, ' well, it has the largest ^TravRy^g# graveyard in the world'. It is claimed by those who have excavated these tumuli, that the articles buried with the dead, anc the posture of the skeletons ( their knees drawn up towards their chin) prove that the race which buried its dead here originated from the Mediterranean area . v 13. Phoenician or not as its inhabitants may have been, it is interesting that in the Middle Ages the Garmathian sect of the Ismaili Shias were strongly represented in Bahrain, from where they sent help and support to the Omit in filming Fatimid Caliphate in iigypt. Now, however, Ismailis in Bahrain could be counted on one's fingers, and the strong hold of that sect in the Gulf is at Muscat. This is, of course, a fresh irmnigration from India, and large numbers of the Khojas and Aga Khanis there still possess British nationality. Indian Dunnis are mostly to be found on the Trucial Coast, where they are ^Qncrlcally called ' Hyderabadis'. They speak Arabic and wear Arab dress, except that they affect the coloured turban rather than the white, hanging Kufiyah of the desert. ■yx Hindu temple at Muscat Pearl diving scenes 14. Apart from Muslims, there are, of course, consider able colonies of Hindu traders all up and down the coast; and their local name of 'banians' truly indicates India's predominant interest in the Gulf, namely the export trade to it. In Muscat the Hindu coilony ( nearly all Gujeratis) is particularly strong, and they have built for themselves a very fine temple in the best-watered part of the town's outskirts. A tragic memento of the former heyday of India's trade with the Persian coast of the Gulf is found in the presence of a Hindu temple in Bandar Abbas, now deserted. However, with the end of autocracy in Persia, we may hope for a mor^liberal commercial policy there, and puja may soon again be done in the temple at Bandar Abbas. 16. Indian traders are not only interested in the export trade; many of them engage also in the pearl trade. On the pearl banks the divers plunge from the side of their ships all through the summer days, with their simple equipment of a clip for the nose and a wire basket for the-5- oysters torn from the sea bed. They go down on one rope, to which a heavy stone is attached; they are pulled up on another rope, two tugs on which are the signal for their 'puller' to oend to his task and get them as quickly as possible to the surface where they can ease their strain ing lungs. Among the anchored ' sarabuqs ' move the sailing ooats ( or more often, now-a-days, launches) of the ' tawwafs', merchants who regularly visit the banks and buy their pearls direct from the ' sambuq' captains. These latter are no mere ' deck officers'. They are the business head and representative of the whole toiling community that comprises their ship's crew. One fifth only of the season's takings is reserved for the captain; the rest, after paying the ship's expenses and the share of the owner, is divided among the crew, divers receiving twice the share of the pullers, and even the ship's boys a small share. One may imagine how the captain is on trial in the eyes of his men as he sits on the poop of his' ship, and hands coffee to the visiting Arab or Indian 'tawwaf', before engaging on long and technical arguments about the merits of the pearls he has to sell. 16. In these days, the natural pearl trade is facing of grave competition from the growth of the science/^culturing pearls. Heavy punishment attends the introduction of a cultured pearl into the Gulf market; but other waters t'oo produce oysters which can be artificially stimulated to make pearls by the introduction of a tiny grain of grit a between the flesh and the shell. It is/fortunate circum stance that at the very time .when the pearl trade of the Oil drilling and Gulf began to wane, a bright new star of prosperity refinery scenes, appeared on the horizon in the form of the scintillating dividends of oil concessions. At present every ruler in the Arab coast, from the sultan of Muscat down to the Shaikh of tiny Ajman, holds a concession with one company or another. The pearl fleet has grown smaller and smaller year by year; but the men who formerly sought their living with bursting lungs and straining ear-drums, can now earn better pay helping to manipulate a drilling rig, driving a lorry or regulating refinery gauges. I will not say whether this is progress or not; but it is at least prosperity. 17o Naturally, venturesome Indians have not been slo^r to avail themselves of the change of well-paid jobs that the Gulf now affords. In all oil companies a very high percentage of responsible technical and office posts are held by Indian, whose salaries add to -that great sum which represents the coiiimercial value of the Gulf to India. 18. Airways have not yet been mentioned , but this is not from any lack of importance. They may in the future become India's strongest link with the Gulf, but it v/ill perhaps suffice to say this much, as a furtner paper specifically on communications in the Gulf is to be pre pared by the writer for the Institute. 19, If then we may draw a general conclusion, it must oe that on this highway to the heart of the Middle Kast, which is India's most natural sphere for commercial expansion, as it is the sphere in which she can most usefully contribute to the security of Asia, India has a-6- v7 long as a and profitaole history of enterprise; and she has, member of the British Commonwealth, a tradition of friendly and cooperative relations with the xirab rulers. In latter years, the pre-war regime in Persia caused a contraction of India's interests on the Persian side of the Gulf; but there is reason to believe that they will revive fifter the war, and increased trade both direct with India and with Indian traders on the ^rab coast may again lead to settlement of Indian enterprise on the northern shore of the Gulf.C OilMUKICAIIONa IN THE PSRSIAN. GULF . Our globes show us that a vast barrier of mountains and desert, stretching from the Karakoram to Aden, shuts India off from communication with Europe and the Middle East. This barrier has its passes through which a conquering army can come, as India has often found to her cost. But for the contacts and commerce of peace time, sea-^ays are the necessary vehicles, and.of these there are two. The Red Sea, thpugh she does not breach but only out-flanks the barrier, lifts her two fingers in the V-sign, as if in token of the supremacy she has enjoyed since the cutting of the Suez Canal, But that supremacy was not always here, and there are signs that it is already passing back again to her age- old rival, the Persian Gulf. 2. This stretch of water, thanks to the narrow breach in the mountain-desert barrier which the history laden straits of Hormuz afford, lays open to princely highway for Indian venturers to the very heart of the Middle East, the valley of the two rivers which cradled civilizations, when Indian' and Europe alike were barbarous and unlettered. 3. I spoke of the two sea lanes as rivals, and this indeed they are. It was the invention of the steamship even before the Suez Canal was opened, that made the R e d Sea the highroad to India. The Ked Sea is no route for wind-propelled vessels, for in it the winds at each end flow inwards to the centre. Anyone who has sailed even a dingy knows that a run before the wind followed by a dead-beat into the wind's eye, is a far slower business than a reach all the way. Moreover the old square-rigged ships of East India Company days and earlier would hardly sail within six points of the wind, and a dead-beat often meant that they would tack back and forth, gaining no ground at all. It may be remembered how Ireland was saved from invasion by Napoleon through the fact that a strong wind got up which blew straight down the narrow stretch of Bantry Bay, up which the laden transports were trying to beat, and blew them clean out into the ocean. The Red Sea has to thank James Jatt, then, for her recent victory in her contest with the Cape route; and before that again she had to fight the Persian Gulf. 4. In those early days ? the Cape route to the Indies was unknown, and travellers had to choose between a short overland haul across the Suez Isthmus followed s by interminable days of beating back and forth in the Red Sea; or the longer trek from the Mediterranean to Basra, followed by the shorter sea voyage of the Persian Gulf . The latter had the further advantage of tapping rich markets en route ^ whereas the Red Sea throughout its length is nothing but a continuation ( to put the cart before the horse) of the Suez Canal. Communications between India and Europe along the shortest route, that of the Persian Gulf, have necessarily depended on the attitude of the inhabitants of the land-neck that inter venes between the Gulf and the Mediterranean, that area which Prof, Breasted so well describes as the 'fertile crescent', up from the land of the two rivers, across by Mosul and ancient Palmyra, and down through Syria and Palestine to Egypt, Passage through this belt from the northern approach also depended on the whim of the hole ers-2- of the Bosphorus. Thus in the Middle Ages, the Venetians, who quarrelled with the rulers of Constantinople, had to go and settle at Alexandria and Hosetta, in order to continue their eastern trade. The Genoese then succeeded to the inland caravan routes across Asia, which they held despite occasional disputes with the ^eljuk Turks. 'Finally the capture oi Constantinople ( which thBnceforth became Istanbul) by the Turks, closed this door to the Christian nations of the west, and provided the stimulus which led to the discovery of the Cape route to India. 6. As I have said, it was steam that revived the Red uea route, and it is petrol that is swirling the balance back once more to the overland-cum-Persian Gulf route. 1 will avoid obvious truisms of nomenclature such as 'the transport medium oi the future' and pass on to remark tnat the Persian Gulf route, with its land Continuation across Iraq and Palestine, presents an ideal route for a predominently coastal and maritime association^' of nations such as the British Commonwealth. It is no accident that British Overseas Airways have for years pinned their iaitn on Hying boats - not land planes - for the main Empire route to Australia; and it may be predicted that when India herself begins to operate inter-territorial airways, she will find the flying boat best suited to a large majority of the territories surrounding the ocean whicn bears her name, to which she will want to run air services. The xirab shore of the Persian Gulf provides an ideal route for flying boats because of the string of enclosed xagoons and creeks which it possesses. The principal 'seadrome' ( if I may use this hybrid word) is that of Khor Kaliya at Bahrain, an almost entirely enclosed lagoon, 2 miles long and 1^ miles wide, the flying-boat dream. Sheltered water is of course the one alighting surface which is always dead level ( for all practical purposes), and which needs no outlay on construction or maintenance. /. Previously, Imperial airways used land-planes and flew down the Persian shore of the Gulf. This had the advantage of being the inner segment of the curved coastal route from Basra to Karachi; but eventually the xenophobic policy oi the late Shah of Persia made Imoerial Airways' position there intolerable, and they moved, bag and baggage, to the iirab shore. Their decision was, of course, reinforced by the growing commercial imoortance of tnat shore, with the discovery of rich oil-fields all along it. Lost oil companies before the war preferred to pay air passages for their executives when going on leave or returning from it, to losing their services for the greater length of time involved in a sea passage. ( Unlike Govern ment of India employees, oil company personnel count their leave only from the date they reach their home country). Hence for many years, Bahrain was the second most profitable stop ( coming after Southampton) on the route. kany a passenger has counted among his ( or her) most Sharjah fort and interesting experiences of the Orient, a night-stop in guards the airways rest house at Sharjah, a square fort-like building with loopholes at the corners, which normally calls forth comparison with that popular novel ' Beau Geste'. The scallywag Arab, guards provided by the Shaikh of Sharjah are growing comparatively indifferent to being photographed for British or Americans albums in which, did they but know it, they undoubtedly figure either as 'Shaikhs' or as 'bedouin', neither of which of course, they are. 9. Turning now to seaways, we find rather the reverse.9 *L -3- v' riciiiGJ-^ tiicit, the 001011111111031/10113 lor th.6 Gulf are Ocirpied. on despite 'the oa.dness of the anohorsges for ships# Leaving aside the Shatt-el-Arab ports of Basra jin.idaaiK and Khorr- amshahr, only kuscat ( with the neighbouring town of Llatrah) has a really sheltered harbour, where shi|9s can discharge iu practically all weathers.

It is fair to say that the entrepot trade of the Gulf, as opposed to the direct Iraq-India trade, has been carried out despite the difficulties of delivering merchandise, rather than from the attraction of easy handling. This, however, visualises only stearaer-borne goods. We must not forget that a very high percentage of India 1 s trade with the Gulf is carried by dhows, which can come iKxl inside to the piers or creeks which afford sheltered water. The handicap of the dhow trade lies i'u^^j je i.ue uUll, namely the fact that dhows cannot sail from India during the south-west monsoon. It is during this period that the Gulf's own sailing ships stay inside its jaws, and large numbers of their crev/s change'from sea men to pearl divers. 10. A paper on communications must not omit to mention cables and wireless. The Gulf is well provided with both of these. Bahrain in particular has a powerful wireless station, while Bushire is the post where cable communi cations irom India, Great Britain and other countries are put on the Persian land-line network for Tehran and other towns. In Iraq the cables come ashore at Fao, at the mouth 01 the Shatt-al- Arab, and forward stxs^ckist coramuni- cation from there is by Iraqi land line. Maintenance of cables is unfortunately a serious problem in tne Guli. The water is generally so shallow and so warm that deterioration of the insulation and protecting cover ings of the cables is rapid. Barnacles and such like creatures proliferate rapidly; and sharp edged coral rock adds to the difficulties of picking up cable for repairs. 11 o ^ue specialized aspect of the Gulf 's communications must be mentioned- the pilgrim traffic. Not only is the usual overload: Gulf the highway for Shia pilgrimage to the holy places of desert back- Iraq, Kejf and Kerbele; but in later years, with the improved k cable ship at work. Lorry with ground capacity of lorries and cars to make the difficult journey across 3ijg'di Arabia, more and more pilgrim traffic for Lecca itself has passed through Kuwait and Bahrain. Ik. Finally, then, we come to the strategic value to India of• these- methods of communication. To assess these, it is only necessary to look at the story of this war and the last. In both of these an army based on India has opera ted in Iraq. In the last war it fought an open enemy, the Turks; in this war the concealed but deadly weapon of the Fifth Column. After this, Persia and Iraq Force (Paiforce, as it is known) stood by as a second line to the Russian defence of the Susiaxx Caucasus. By the grace of God the battles for the defence of India, which were fought at Stalingrad and ill Alamein, went in our favour. Had it not been so, we should certainly have seen hostile armies fighting their way towards our frontiers across the 11 fertile crescent 1 ' of Palestine, Syria and Iraq, and over the•&lt; : *p5*w- -4- plateaux of Persia. How vital the Persian Gulf would then have been to us can be easily understood. Even as things were, its Persian ports, Khorramsh^hr, Bandar Shapur and Bushire, all formed terminals to that steady stream of war material fcr Russia which, at vastly less cost in ships and lives than the Archangel route, gave our Allies the strength they needed for victory on Germany's Eastern front. oa) $EXPRESS LErTER From To Political Agent, Bahrain.

The relations of France and Levant States are defined by some form of written agreement. This is quite irrespective of any question of a privilege position for France in Levant. 3 « H.M's. Government have no intention to withdrawing their General Catroux declaration June 1941. Point out that he made this declaration on behalf of his exiled Government but Lt was upheld by Provisional Government of Liberated France which is • \ fully competent to negotiate agreement. Other powers. (Franco-Soviet treaty is an example). • ' i 1 4. (a) H.M's. Government recognize right of France to a strong position amongst European nations in Levant States always without prejudice to States independence. The object of our assurance in this sense to French was to convince them that we did not intend to supplant them or to obtain for ourselves in Levant States a position similar to that which we hold in Egypt or Iraq. But if France is to obtain any special position of this nature in Levant States it must result in free negotiation. Our assurance to French certainly did not mean (as has sometimes been represented) that we recognize any French right over Levant States. (b) The ( MUT ) should be used only in correcting misstatements. The question of French pre-eminent position should not be raised by us and discussion of it should be discouraged whenever possible. United States and Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have not recognized French right to pre-eminence in any form. * ■ h5. (a) An intelligent indication is essential if any solution is to be found. Inflamatory ^3ronuncements by States of either side are unhelpful and should be discounted. (b) For declaration of a British policy the public should not rely on private individuals but on pronouncements of responsible British Officials. See in particular Mr. Bugatti's account in ( HUT ) of ( I.XIT ). 6. Civil disturbance. In the event of any outbreak of violence it should be stressed; (a) that those responsible for outbreak are damaging their own cause and portion of war effort and must forfeit / British policy of re-establishment of both scopes. (b) If British troops leave it is with no intention of tricking either side to gain tenacity over exiled. Intervention would be designed to restore order and prevent threat to secure foreign ar^a under British operational command. (c) Without defeating independent powers no State anywhere can hope for independence. French and British troops incomparable fighting side by side to ensure that defeat. 7. Troupes Speciapek. Each side can make a strong case for their attitude. We should not take sides but should point out that these troops are performing services for allied, ' command and that any action which threatens their loyalty or discipline is prejudicial to war effort and therefore to be discouraged. - asfflassadoh -?• R.B» Telegram Cypher.

CimiSTOPHER KOIVK) ON BHIIIdil PUBLICITY IN PALESTINE, AND ITS RELATION TO OTHER FUNCTIONS OF QOVBUDilNI. OIVEN OK I ARCH 13, 1946. The status of the Public Information Officer of Palestine probably differs slightly from that of the Ministry of Infora- ation officers in other overseas posts. The Public Inform ation Office is an integral part of the Secretarial of the Palestine Qovernmeat« Palestine has had a Public Information Officer since 1936 f previously to that there had been a Press Officer for some years. Karly in 1939 an officer was appoint ed as assistant to the P.I.O. for the specific purpose of counter-propaganda. the new appointment was made as the result of a meeting at which the War Office and Foreign Office, as well as the Colonial Office 9 were represented. I believe it was probably the first case of an officer being appointed to a British administration overseast during the 'sub war* 1 period t for the specific purpose of counter propaganda. The aim of the activities then set on foot by the Palestine Government in co-operation with the military authorities of Palestine may be summarised as an attempt to wean the Arab population away from the Axis. The large majority of politi cally conscious Arabs were at that time pro-Axis| they looked upon Britain as the sponsor of Jewish imiaigration 9 and there fore their enemy. I should like to emphasise that the Arab conflict with the Jews is not basically religious 9 though that may sometimes appear as an irritant} indigenous coranunlties such as the Yemenite Jews have always been tolerated by the Arabs. The objection Is to the penetration of the country by European immigrants! an objection based on fear - fear of the European Jews 1 superior skill| higher culture, and greater power of economic organisation. Fear drives to desperation; and it was desperation, allied to poverty and under-employment, that drove the Arabs into the hills. It was part of our news policy to represent the many Arabs who took active part in the rebellion at that time as Bandits. Some of them probably were, but a good proportion were intellectuals, inspired c by a genuini if misguided, idealism. On the outbreak of war with Qermany in 1989, the rebellion was called off. possibly on an order from Baghdad. The reason: for such an oraer were probably that the frift^s advisers told him, first, that the rebellion had been militarily crushed y as it certainly had been; second, that the British Governmentkat 4k4« 44MAe«i4 VThite Paper policy was at least in part a satis faction of the Arab claims; and lastly, that to declare loyalty to the British Government at this difficult time might be a wise move and store up Arab credit for the future. Whatever the exact reasons, the rebellion was called off; but this did not mean a complete change of heart on the part of the Arab leaders, who remained exceedingly reserved. Publicity's Job was to convert an audience not onlv hostile but x unwilling to listen. All information from British sourct was suspect, so that much resistance had to be broken down befoi propaganda could take any effect. I think we may have started with the idea that propaganda was something you manufactured, and handed out, and then watched it take effect. In practice-2- i it was not quite as simple as that* First an audience had to be created, and to do this the first measures taken were restrictive. A drastic press censorship was imposed} and this on the tfhole tsas welcouied by the Arabic press | since the pre* vious practice of suspending a newspaper only efter it liad oiTfexidad left thern open to terrorist pressure. The Jewish press was rather loss plonsed with tho censorship, but accepted It as a necessity at tnis time* Vliy result or this censorship, which was Impartially applied wu the whole press, was virtually to ban political polemics in Palestine newspapers tor 2k years. Xho iioxt task of Lhe Public Information Officer, and his staTf wuti Uo help re-establish personal contacts. Since the rabellioHf evea the simpler adrainlstrstive contacts had lapsed; alien ihese were restored - as gradually they nere - the work of propaganda twca^ie ea.ii^r. I must point out that in this inswuice the P.I.O. was only carrying out the policy of tao Adiainistration, zo whoji credit for the restoration of these persorial contacts should cniefly belong* I think the results of our influencing of Arab public opinion in Palestine uiay be looked upon as successful* W# had to contend with various elements likely to have an unsett ling effect on the public mindt there was the Hashid All rebellion in Iraq and the focus of infection represented by the Vichy French in Syria* British forces were uunerically weak, and for son»e time there was the direct threat to Palwsvlne by uie Axis armies through ^ypt* In spite of all this, it is true to say that during the war years there has baen no important deterioration in public security due to Arabs* (Banditry and robbery with violence, which are andemic in Palestine, sank to rather below their usual level)* In my view, the credit for this «a44«^aeM satisfactory state of affairs can be given tot 1* x'ha White Paper policy* 2* I'iie presence of isilitary force, improved police methods and censorship* 3* Progressive expansion and improveuient of administrative services* 4* Kconoaic revival due to the war* 6* Propagantia* I must say sooiething about the actual working of the Public Information Ofrice* It is housed separately frow the Secretariat, of which it is a part, and has greatly expanded since 1939* the staff now numbers about 100, which brings the Public Information Office about to the level of a Palestine Government Department* It acts also, of course, as the Palestine Office of the Ministry of Information, which bears much of the expenditure. As an example of 'Ministry' activity, it is worth mentioning that audiences for ii*0*I. films in Palestine are closely comparable in numbers to those in Sgypt, to which they are next iii order of importance* This is because Palestine is a country organised on Kuropean lines) larre sections of the population have their eyes turned towards Europe, and this applies in soma degree to the Arabs as well as the Jews* fhe fact that the Public Information Office is a department of the/-~3- of the Palestine government and that Palestine Is a British administered country, means that certain adjustments have to be made. In a foreign country, where the Publlcty Officer Is attached to the British diplomatic mission, it may be good propaganda to make a splash; In PeF«Palestlne this may have to be ^voided, and the Public Information Office has to move in step with other Government departments# This proper regard for economy has to be reconciled with the efficient performance of information work, of which, by virture of being a Government Department, the P.I.O. is probably expected to undertake rather more than any other Posts. The work has to be performed with due regard to the functions of other Departments: liaison also has to be maintained with the British Council. All this sounds rather compllcted, but in actual practice it works out quite easily, mostly in terms of personal contacts. One of the most Important jobs of the Public Information Office was and is to organise contacts between the people of the country and their Government. One of the best media for this is the monthly press conference given by the Chief Secretary, and organised by the P.I.O. The Chief Secretary answers questions put to him by represent atives of the Arabic and Jewish press; major political questions are barred, but grievances can be aired, which is most valuable and Important in a country without a Parliament. w The Public Information Officer holds weekly press conferences, and also organiSes contacts between press representatives and heads of Government Departments. The P.I.O. sends a representative to Hie meetings of the War Economic Advisory council. This officer takes the minutes, and where security considerations do not Intervene, prepares a report for the press. I would like to say something about the present condition of the Palestine Arabs. They must not be thought of as Beduin; there are some Beduln, but the mass of the Arabs are peasant cultivators. Although land in Palestine is poorer than in Bgypt, they are probably better off than the Egyptian fellahln. This is because they are better protected by law and looked after by the Administration. Nevertheless, like most peasant cultivators, they live under the shadow of debt. The agricultural economy of Palestine is on the Mediterranean pattern, which means living on a very narrow margin. If crops are bad, the peasantry have nothing with which to buy necessities or seed for their next crop, and so they borrow, which means 14v4iig-eii-a-- that two bad years running may leave them in debt. British Mandatory Government has done a good deal to alleviate this Aate of affairs; one Important measure has been the conversion of former communal villahe holdings into small holdings. A communal system of land tenure sounds very progressive, but in practice it meant the Impoverishment of the land and consequently of the peasantry. £ach family cultivated a strip of land for one year in turn, and then moved on to the next strip, as in the Mad Hatters tea party. There was no incentive to put capital improvements into the/- \-4 U^T into the land, During the war the scarcity of agricultural imports, and the demand for labour on military works, have meant a period of considerable prosperity for the fellahin, and this has boon a factor in internal security. Literacy fiL ^ong Palestinian Arabs is higher than in Sgypt or in Syria. Under the Mandato, a ^oo^i percentafe of Arabs get education up t^a standard hign for the Middle East; they also get instruction in jt improved methods of agriculture in Gcvcriment schoolst of which, however, there are not nearlv enough. Here i .s probably the rignt point to say that, in considering expansion of any information activities in Palestine, the claims on available manpower of other Government services. «9, for instance, education, have to be borne in mind, I mention education because information work cennot, in my ^iew, be divorced from it. To sum up, the Arab's attitude to the Palestine problem is not governed by primarily racial or religious consider ations. liis attitude is that cf any native people to foreign lirnii grants. He had no anti-Je^ prejudice before 1922. we must remember that the Palestine problem is one we ourselves have created, primarily for idealistic reasons. The Zloaist argument that we support the Jewish National Komc! only from imperialist~c motives, because we want to maintain our inxluence in countries adjacent to the Suez Canal zone can, I think, be dismissed. We shall obviously keer- our looting in the Canal zone, Zionism or no Zionism, so lone as wo are a preat power. The ar^uciant takas no account of the Zionist idea, which, after developing among British Christians as well as Jews for 60 years or so, finally finmd expressi&amp;c Ih the Balfcur Declaration. • Jewish immigration Into Palestine has come in waves. The earliest came mainly from Russia. The Social-Democrat and Nationalist ideology of these early Russian Jewish immigrants was from the start in conflict with Russian CoumunisKU a conflict which has persisted to this day. 3ext came waves of Polish Jews; and with the beginning of the Hitler persecution a new type of immigrant began to arrive. The first to be displaood by persecution were naturally those with the fewest roots, mostly from the friogea of Nazi expansion. At first those Germans who were politically exposed and so had to leave their homes, mostly chose to go to the western states or to Russia^* Many of those who went to Palestine, being people easy to displace, ^ere perhaps of a type which a discriminating Qovernment, solicitous for the welfare of the country, might class as undesirable. Parallel with this however, there was a acceleration of ajKfgtttciifry specifically Zionist immigration, mostly young people who had accepted pioneer training - in England or other couiitries of origin - and were placed in agricultural settlements. The original ideal of Zionism was settled on the land, in communities; but even Zionists have to admit that this ideal has not been fully attained. Of the 600,000 Jews now in Palestine, only 30$ are settled on the land; and it is worth noting that 130,000 live in Tel Aviv, uany of them in what can only be described as slum conditions. It has now become the official view of the Zionist leaders that Palestine must be industrialised. It has become plain that settlement on the land will not provide for the ,, miillons ,, whom the Zionists now talk of bw4R4*g-4jR bringing in; the only answer must be industrialisation; which has, of course, been given an enormous stimulus by the war. The war in fact brought Palestine industry to life; to the great benefit of the Jewish inhabitants, who found outlets for their special skills and talen for economic organisation. The war/-The war has regenerated the econonlc but not the cultural life of Palestine. It brought a wave of 'last-resort' Iwalgrants - Jews who caMe to Palestine because they could not go anywhere else. They have naturally not settled happily; they feel frustrated. Frustration In fact is at the root of the aoral side of the Palest ine problen. It weighs heavily on both Jews and Arabs, who see all Govemmert posts of any importance, and all effective political power, in the hanas uf 'aliens»•. This^nobody^ fault; the cause brings us back to the basic problea created by two conflicting populations, nei ther of which can be expecte&lt;i to supply officers who will be loyal to anything but their omi community. It is in fact the better type both of Jew twpd Arab nho feels this coaiaunlty loyalty Most strongly. Jews from Europe suffer from an extra sense of frustration &lt;iue to living in a small restricted community, which puts &amp; deadening limit to the deg ree of distinction which can be attained by any individual; this is particularly stifling to the artist. This state of affairs is of course, inevitable in any small nationalistic state. It is necessary to s&amp;y soEething about terrcrisa. It is of course a manifestation of Nazism, which came late to Palestine, which like most small nationalistic countries has developed late politically. , Enrolment in one of the several terrorist organisations is an outlet for the Jewish youths who find the training provided by the Hagana, (the para-mllitary organisation sponsored by the Jewish Agency) too tame for them. I should say that roughly 1 in 20 of the rising gen eration of Jews was a potential candidate for a terrorist organisation. The dissipation of this feeling of frustsation should be a principal aim of our work; but until the Government declares a policy for the f future of Palestine, we can do very little in this direction. Ahat we can and are coing, however, is to try to convince the people of Palestine that membership of the British Commonwealth of Rations is a fine and desirable thing; that it laust be to the advantage of any country to join this Commonwealth, whether as a full member or as an associate, like for instance Iraq. We must convince the Palestinians that the time has passed when we exploited the world for our benefit - if there ever was such a time it ended about 1900: our aim now is to develop from existing institutions a peaceful world in which our ideals of democracy anc tolerance can be applied. Before we set out to sell our ideal of democracy to Jews and Arabs, it is as well to clear our minds as to what the word means to us; and also to remember that our whole conception of democracy must be alien to these Eastern peoples, whose hiitory is so tifferert from our own. They have had no long period in which to develop toleration in living together. When mm an Arab now says **1 am in favour of democracy M he really means 'I accept your ideas since you are winning the war and I wish to stand well with you'. The next generation may come to understand the meaning of the word democracy, which at present is not much wot* than a convenient label. PABg 11. QUESTIONS AND AKSWERB. Miss Sarrell asked whether those Jews who had a nostalgia for Bur- ope and had failed to settle down in Palestine i^ould be likely to go elsowhere after the war. Answeri They will certainly wish to leave Palestine but it is un- likely that they will be able to do so. Europe will bo so disorgan ised that they will probably wish to go to England or the U .S., and it is improbable that thoy will be allo^od to do so. Much depends on what news reaches them from their former homes. Br. Graves Law asked whether the Palestine Government kept the P. 10. ♦INFORMED OF POLICY D3CI3I0N3, so that publicity could be closely re lated to Government policy.

Graves Law also asked if any thing was done to keep the Far Eastern war in the public eye. Answer : In accordance with Ministry of Information directions publicity is firlv«n to the 6 Far Sastern war in publications and broadcasts. Public interest is very litiited, the public tendency beinU to think that the end of the Qerman war will neand the end of all restrictions, anrt an immediate return to peacetime cond itions. To coroat this view 1« ono of the tasks of publicity* # Asked wn«ther there was tendency amongst the older Arabs to look back upon the Turkish regime as the 'good old days 11 and to reieret then, Mr. nolroe said this only happened when the Arab or Arabs concerned had a grievance against the British Government, Further points wnlch emerged from tne discussion werei- a) that; the Arab population had almost doubled under the Mandate; b) that the ^rab population increased at a higher rate than the Jews; these figures applyinn only to the birthrate and tak ing no account of Immigration, c) tnat It was one of the meior tasks of publicity to combat the PaXestlnians 1 sense of isolation by opening their eyes to wider horiasons. As much information as possible about the world outside Palestine was carried in publications, broadcasts, films and so on. d) In the industrialisation of Pelestine, the Jews tended to see themstlves as the employers, with the Arabs only as operat- $ Ives.

This paper is based on information received up to the end of February, 194-5* Since the First Addendum to the Appreciation (Papf.j.' No. 2&amp;~]k) vas drawn up, the situation in Persia has not radically altered. The Tehran Declaration, following the Conference of the three Allied leaders in December 1943i was regarded in Persia as a charter of that country^s independence and integrity; and particular value was attached to the fact that the U\ S.A. had joined in the guarantee* Unhappily the good effect of the Declaration has been largely offset recently by the undisguised interference of. the U .S.S .R. T^ith Persia's indepen- ''\ce in the matter of the oil concession which they demanded. Such sections of people as had always regarded Russia with suspicion - have had anple Justifi cation for their fears in the attitude taken 'up^ by the l. S.S'.H ., and even those hitherto less hostile to the Soviet have been anta.gonised. Russia is, in fact, now almost universally regarded and feared by Persians as n an aggressive, grabbing power' (Mil. Att. Int. Summ. No. 47, 27.1-2 Soviet pressure on Persia in the matter of the oil concession was reinforced by the venal press and by the Tudeh party, which showed itself to be entirely pro-Russian on^ this issue. But the country as a whole felt that with the sacrifice of the Prime Minister Sa'ed they had gone far enough in the way of concessions to the Russians, and this gesture was followed by a stiffen:ng of their- attitude .to Russia which surprised even the Persians themselves by its proof ci. at least a degree of moral strength and courage* The British public attitude, which could'be shown as ^eing one of great caution and restraint, was condemed by certa.in sections of the people as lacking in courage and a betrayal of her share in the responsibility for the Declaration. ' , , The U.S. Mission, headed by Dr. Millspaagh, who has now resigned, has incurred general antagonism, and has to some extent united certain apparently irreconcilable elements in Persia. Against this background it can be seen that the attitude towards Britain, if it has not improved, v ms a*, least not deteriorated. Internal Situation . This has not improved; Mr. Savidge, the late Pres Attach6, reported in^the sui-^r of 19A4 that the 'executive Government is at •its lowest ebb - corruption ana political dishonesty are everywhere the order of the day, and^the^lot of all but the privileged is indeed an unhappy one' . The. prevalent feeling is one of disillusionment, especially among the younger and more educated Persians, and of pessimism as to the present and future of Persia. Nevertheless, in spite of the traditional Persian tendency to attack Britain for most,of the country-s misfortunes, there has been exhibited a growing realisation in the press of late that the Persians themselves are largely responsible for the present state of affairs, and that the remedy lies to a great extent in their own hands: a number of new mag'sines hatre appeared recently in which responsible writers are urging the need lor drastic ruiorms in public life. Inflation is still serious, there is a chronic currency shortage and crises, particularly in transport and gra^n distribution, are recurrent; recently prices have fallen a little, but this has been rather in anticipation of the end of the European war with the inevitable lessening of shortages of commodities, than due to the real stabilisation of the economic situation; merchants have heavy stocks in hand and fear that a fall in wholesale prior,s wf 11 come as soon as the war ends. P.T.O.Labour Troubles have appeared from time to time, and there^has oeen^unrest among workers especial^ in Isfahan; there has also been a considerable increase in the Tudeh (Communist) Party's activities, supported, it is alle S^» 1)y th ? Soviet authorities in Persia. An attempt was made by th ® to introduce a Mitional Service Bill which would have subjected Government ^ industrial employees to conscription; it received, however, considera 1 opposition and was rejected. It is recognised by the governing ^s that the withdrawal of the occupying troops and the subsequent u^mplo^ent win p o fruitful soil for subversive activities; M. Beyat, the Prime Minister ho succeeded M. Sa f ed after the oil concession dispute, is trying to deal with situation as it develops. But his own position is precarious. The tribal situation is undergoing a gradual and steady _J he recent report from Shiraz suggests that there is a lessening of attachment to tribal life and loyalties, due largely to the impact of the war on these areas. This fact is not yet fully appreciated by the Persian administration, t serious efforts were made now to dispose of outstanding disputes ^ ^ ^laims and to settle the tribes on the land, it is probable that c o ns ^ er ^ b ^ could be made which would be beneficial to the government, to the tnbespeople themselves, and to the general security of the country. Two distinct trends have been noticed during 1m: with the big Qashgai and Bakhtiari confederations there was a consolidation of that power. ^ on the other hand, the disunity of the Kurdish tribes enabled ^ he J 0 reestablish its authority in areas from which it had effectively been exolu since 1941, and in Khuzistan again little difficulty was experienced in disanntng the Arab tribes - a process which was still going on at the close of the y Relations with other Countries . Relations with Britain and all their historic misunderstandings have been outlined in previous papers; there has been little change, though at tunes fleeting amelioration has taken place, if only due to an increase ^ th ® between Persia and the other two 'occupying' powers. British Council activities are on the increase both in the capital and in the outlying areas. The belief is generally prevalent that Reza Shah was kept in power by the British ^d now ouf reluctance to interfere with the present is apt to be misrepresented as typical of British indifierence. It is frequently stated that Sa'ed Zia is a tool of the British - a conviction carefully ^fostered by the Soviet - and Persian opinion is divided on the desirability of his presence in the country. Relations with the U.S.S.R . have already been touched on in the first para graph. It may be added that, although for the moment the storm has abated^the recent oil bill introduced by Dr. Musaddig and immediately accepted by the Majlis is hardly likely to be accepted by the Russians as the last word m the matt . Relations with the U.S.A . The Persian criticism of the U.S.A. takes two forms: (a) The almost universal antipathy to Dr. MiUspaugh and his Ms^ion, which resulted in the formal abrogation of his economic powers and finally his resignation; the Mission continues in Persia but with considerably less influence. (b) The presence of U.S. troops in Persia without the sanction of any treaty. Another influence disturbing to Persia is the rivalry Shell groups. But the Millspaugh Misaian, against a local background of administ tive and economic chaos and extremes of riches and poverty, provides the most constant and irresistible target. r P.T.O.Per sipji opinion ia centred on two main problems: (a) What vdlll happen on the expiry of the Treaty six months after the end of the war, and (b) What status will Persia enjoy at the Peace Conference as a reward for her 'sacrifices'. In the li^ht of these problems and of the military situation in Europe^ our publicity policy in the territory will have to be reviewed. Conclusiona « An important point which must be stressed in our publicity is the fa«t that there can be no icnodin^e amelioration of conditions in Persia after the war with Germany is over, as tireyasport and supplies will still have to be rigorously curtailed raid controlled until the Pacific War is won. Although it is laid down in the Tripartite Treaty that the allied troops in Persia are to be withdrawn 6 months after the conclusion of hostilities (which, so far as we arc concerned, includes the war with Japan), we must be prepared for increasing demands for thajy ^aj^urture after the war witJ^ CkiJcmatiy is over, (indeed) the demand that thc^y should Lc-cai^ j^-pc^ r. now is already boiug made in the press). We must therefioru begin to thinkdT^w ia^guration and ■aojjvteaacice of the activities -which we intend.to carry on oiter that sta^c is reached* . These probably lie ra^in^ in the field of commerce. There will be strong conpctition| but the time has when we must lay the foundations for post-war economic reLatioas between Britain and Persia - the influence which Will result from coDLiercial tics should prove an effe/M;j-v&lt;» • British 11 ooataA' cXtirr with&lt;fe;vTai the aoup-t^r*SECRET. OVERSEAS PLANNING COMMITTEE. PLAN OF PROPAGANDA FOR PERSIA . AIMS &amp; OBJECTIVE S. PAPER NO&gt; 35OA . AIMS . (1) The chief aim of British propaganda in Persia should be to encourage the emergence as soon as possible of a united and independent Persia friendly to Great Britain. (2) It must be our further aim to encourage and support all efforts made by the Persians themselves to proncte the internal security of the country, its political and economic stability and necessary social reforms. Note; The main theme underlying all our propaganda should be to prove to the Persians that insofar as political and economic stability and administrative and social progress are conceded, the interests o^ the two countries are identical and that we mean to cooperate with Persia, botn now and after the war. OBJECTIVES . 1 ' TO CONVINCE THE PERSIANS THAT BRITAIN IS CONCERNED TO SEE A PERSIA WHICH IS UNITED. PEACEFUL, &amp; I N DEPENDENT . The tendency to blame Britain for all Persia's ills, which is almost endemic in the country , can probably never be overcome, but it may be countered to some extent by demonstrating that a peaceful, independent, and progressive Persia is as much to our advantage as to that of Persia herselfJ that we are greatly concerned to see programmes of social and administrative reform carried through, aid are prepared to help in any way we can. Full publicity must repeatedly be gi^en to all promises and engagements in which we have undertaken to safeguard Persia's independence and integrity, such as tne Tehran Declaration of 1st December,. 1943* We must let the Persians know that we intend to carry out these pledges. IK TO PUBLICISE AW MEASURES TAKEN BY THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES WHICH CAN BE SHOWN ' ' TO HAVE BENEFITED PERSIA, &amp; TO ENGAGE SO FAR AS POSSIBLE XN CONSTRUCTIVE EFFORTS TO ^MELIORATE CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRY . Partly as a result of the war and partly as a result of the inefficiency and weakness of a succession of governments in Persia in the last few years, the the economic situation of the country is serious. There is dire poverty, but even greater die tress might have been experienced had it not been for the various measures taker by the United Nations in such directions as the anti- locust campaigns, the provision of medical supplies and mobile dispensaries, etc. These should all be publicised whenever possible. This Ministry's con structive work is ne^sj^sarily limited in scope - all the more so since it has now been decided that humanitarian activities are the responsibility of the Foreign Office rather than this Ministry - and must relate mainly to the fields of general education and heal': v . One of the principal services we can render the Persian people is helping the;n to improve bheir knowledge of the world and overcoming problems connected with public health. In that direction we can and do assist the Persian authoritirs in undertaking anti-malaria and anti-typhus campaigns and in gi^aig film shows in technical and educational institutions all over the country. In such a field we are sure of the active interest and cooperation of the Pe.sians; and any service we can render them will be repaid in increased friendliness. P.T.O.- 2 - 111. to encourage a sense of civic responsibility /tmongst persians . Many Persians are aware of the deficiencies in their adirdnistrative system which have given rise to some of their country's difficulties. This awareness should be turned to account by encouraging anong the more critical and educated Persians a sense of corporate responsibility and by fostering any signs of awakening social conscience. Material on British social services, labour organi sation, the prevention of inflation, should be supplied, and information about progress in these fields must be made available for individuals and bodies who are interested in these subjects. Purthermnre, we can, while avoiding a patronising or critical tone, rein force by quotation, etc. (on the B.B.C. and in the English Press if possible) any progressive and authoritative articles written in the local newspapers or magazines which stress the point that the salvation of Persia ultimately depends on the efforts of the Persians themselves. We can, and should, add that we are greatly interested in the success of their efforts. IV « PROJECTION OF BRITAIN . ( a ) General . The projection of Britain by itself will have no lasting effect. It must be linked up with the actual needs of the people in the country. So where it can be shown that Persia will benefit from a study of British institu tions, etc., no opportunity should be lost of giving the Persian Government authorities and the more progressive Persians all the information we can. Plans for the future should be publicised in relation to events as they take place. (b) war Effort . This aspect is still important in Persia even though the end of the European war approaches, and it must not be allowed to lapse in order to combat the illusion of British militaiy weakness. The Persians should not be allowed to forget the price that Britain has had to pay in order to bring the war to its present stage. 'It is probable that there is still much ignorance in Persia as to the extent of our sacrifices, and we must continue to project this aspect of Britain in every possible way. (c) Conmiercial . Britain^ economic vitality and the part she intends to play in post-war world commerce must be stressed. Until, however, the Govern ment's export policy has been defined, we must be content with publicising Britain's progress in the industrial field along the lines laid down in O.P.C. Paper No. 50QB, under III in O.P.C. Paper No. 55&amp;B, and in S.I.C. Paper No. 33A. V. TO FOSTER GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN PERSIANS AND BRITISH TROOPS OR SUBJECTS IN x. The M.O.Z* representatives in Persia can, and should, do much in their own way to reinforce the work of the British Council in this field. It is particu larly important in a country like Persia where misunderstandings are prone to arise owing to ignorance of each other's language and whose people are perhaps exceptionally sensitive and suspicious. The close collaboration between the P.R.B. and the Military and Commercial authorities in Persia is also essential to the achievement of this objective. In actual fact close collaboration with the British Council in Persia and with the Persian Government authorities in many directions has for some time been a cornerstone of the policy of the P.R.B. Efforts in this direction should not be relaxed. VI, FAR EASTERN WAR . This is a subject in which so far there is very little interest or knowledge in Persia. The following aspects of the Par Eastern War should be stressed: first , that until victory over Japan has been achieved there can be no slackening of the war effort and little diminution of sacrifices in any part of the world; second , that Britain has responsibilities in the Par East which she does not mean to avoid, and is contributing her full share to winning the war in that area. It is necessary therefore to prevent any undue complacency in Persia about the end of the war and to combat impatience with wartime restrictions which must remain in force for some time to come. Emphasis on the shipping problems that will prevent full supplies from reaching Britain while the war in the Pacific is being waged is of the utmost importance. PERSIAf. ^/3 S.O.
