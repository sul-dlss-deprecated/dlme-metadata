B. M's Political Agent, Bahrein. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith in triplicate my annual Reports for 1348 together with Budget for 1349. This is the fifth Budget which I have had the honour to submit. I was unable to complete it before owing to pressure of work. The past year had been a bad one, financially, and the expenditure has been heavy owing to cost of the electric scheme. The State completed the year with a balance to its credit of Rs. 3,40,365/- as against Rs. 5,50,479/- at the end of the about • , previous year, and liabilities amounting to/hs. 50,600/- due for completion of electric work which will be paid from the funds in Bombay during 1349. It has been suggested that a Budget covering four or five years ahead should be made. If the Revenue greatly exceeded the expenditure this could be done but as may be seen in the ne?/ Budget the estimated Revenue only just covers the essential A expenditure. There is no possible margin for any new large schemes. The Sea Road to Muharrak has been started and it is the most ardent wish of Shaikh Earned that it should be completed-Jl ^^jSo GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. - 2 - Unfortunately it has only been possible to allocate a very small sum to this work. The possiblities of a loan were discussed but owing to the bad pearl season the chances of raising it were nil*? I have the honour to be Sir, Your obedient servant.

Revenue. For the last four years owing to steadily increasing revenue it has been possible each year to estimate an in crease in receipts. In my last annual report I wrote that it was generally thought that the trade prospects for the coming year were not promising. Owing to trouble on the mainland and the Persian question it was thought that trade would be adversely affected. Unfortunately this predic tion was true and in addition to these reasons an abnor mally bad year on the pearl market has resulted in general trade depression which is reflected in a serious falling off in revenue. In my opinion and in the opinion of the mercantile community in Bahrain the prospects for the new year are even ?/orse than those of the past year. Unless there is a complete change in the condition of the pearl market the financial position in the new year will be very serious For these reasons instead of budgeting for an increased revenue I have reduced the estimated customs collections to Rs 8,30,000/- which is one lac less than the estimated collection for 1348 and Rs , o o less than the actual amount collected during that year. It is hoped that the revenue will exceed this amount but I feel that it would be dangerous to expect any more. The Customs collections are the main revenue of the State, its other sources of income are almost negligible. Miscellaneous . Rs 20,000/-. This heading includes various fees and duties collected by the customs such as tobacco tax, harbour dues, etc. and also passport fees, the last two items did not exist before this year.- 2 - Jndicial Receints . Es 20,000/-. This includes all fees (ft collected^the Land Department on registration and sales of property* These registrations are to be made com pulsory in the new year and some changes are also being made in the collection of court fees which should result in an increased revenue from both these sources. Rents from Government Land . This includes Rs 10,000/- which is paid by the Eastern General Syndicate as rent on the oil concession, also £ 120/- per annum being rent of aerodrome and leases of Government ground which was formerly occupied freely by squatters. The last item is a steady and increasing revenue which has only commen ced this year. Electricity . The receipts from electrical supply are somewhat problematical and depend partly on the Y/eather, but according to the present load the costs of the staff and of running the engines should be covered by the pay ments made by the consumers, which include the payments made by Government departments and by the Municipality for street lighting. Loans recoverable . This large sum consists of money lent to members of the Ruling Family and others for the period of the Diving season. The amount would have been consi derably larger but owing to shortness of funds H. E. Shaikh agreed definitely to refuse all further applications for loans. The money is lent without interest and in some cases with no security except a personal guarantee. In previous budgets the money which is on deposit and current account in Bombay has been shown in the annual budget and has been allocated on the expenditure side to some particular objects. In the 1349 budget this has not been done. As there is every prospect of an extremely-3- extremely bad year it is not proposed that any of this a amount shall be expended so the present budget shows nothing except the actual revenue and loans recoverable. The amount on deposit in Bombay is shown on the balance sheet of the State. Recurrent expenditure . Allowances to Ruling family. The Civil list and allowance have now been definitely limited to not more than five lacs. Actually the present payments amount to about two thousand rupees under the five lacs. Tutor. The tutor to the Shaikh’s sons is shov/n separately as his services do not fall under the general heading of Public Education. His cost is considerably increased ® provision fee to be made for passages, leave and pension contributions according to Government of India rules which are more generous than those applied to other officials employed by the Government of Bahrain. Protection. Although the number of the Indian Police has been considerably reduced, there were originally 110 and there are now 83, their cost is only slightly less than it was last year. This is because a large proportion of them are now due for leave and allowancesr be have to/made for the cost of their passages. It is not possible to reduce the number of nature in Manamah and Muharrak but it is expected that some reduction can be made among the naturs in the outside villages. Government Departments . Customs. This department shows an.increase of Rs over last year. This accounted for partly by the regular increments to the staff, the Provident fund, and an additional number of house allowances which are paid to clerks enlisted from abroad ?/ho are permitted to have their families in Bahrain. The first two reasonsreasons slightly increase the cost of all the Government departments, each year, but against this may be urged the advantage of increased experience and loyalty. Secretariat. This department shows an increase of sion of leave fares for the Adviser who becomes entitled to leave, with passages during the summer of 1349. Land Department. p/t/e surveyors are now working in this department as mil as the ordinary office staff. The work is steadily increasing and will increase still more when registrations are made compulsory. It is possible that in the coming year the collection of fees will cover the expenses of the department. Judicial and Wakfs. This amount was over estimated in the last budget owing to some uncertainty as to the cost of the newly established shia lakf department. Passport department. This department was started at the end of 1348 and is now under the control of the Police, not, as formerly, a part of the customs. The receipts will easily cover the cost of the Depart ment, staff and printing. Public Education. The State provides free education. It has been suggested that fees should be charged but undoubtedly the greater proportion of the parents are too poor to pay and to discriminate between their fin ancial condition would be almost impossible. The amount this year has been reduced from Rs 90,000/- to Rs 60,000/-. Various economies are to be effected by a ie- change in the rates of the masters 1 pay and no new schools will be opened during the year. A detailed report on Education is enclosed. Municipalities. The monthly subsidy to Manamah Muni cipality has been reduced from Rs 2000/- per month to this is partly accounted for by the provito Rs 1000/- per month as the Manamah Municipality has become a comparatively wealthy institution. The sub sidy to Muharrak Municipality remains at Rs 2000/- per month. In addition to these sums they receive bet?/een them the tobacco tax and the motor tax which amounts roughly to about Rs 4000/- per annum to each municipality. Electric Supply. This includes entire cost of running including salary of Engineer who is to be lent to the State for one year by Messrs. Callender's Cable and Construction CoJ:. Ltd., Bombay. Public forks. The provision for repairs to roads and Government buildings, which includes the Customs, has been reduced to the least possible amount. Compensat ion. This covers payment orders, which are frequently made by orders of H. E. Shaikh Hamad to des erving persons whose cases are heard by him and to victims of fires, wrecks and also to persons y/hose pro perty has been wrongfully sold under the late rejime. Special projects.- Muharrak Road. The Government promised to assist the Muharrak Biladya with a special grant of Rs 40,000/- to pay for the sea road which was built along the Muharrak foreshore. Of this amount Rs 20,000/- was paid during 1348, see the remaining Rs 20,000/- is to be paid in two instalments, half during 1348 and half during 1350. Crane. A crane has been required by the Customs for some time. The import of motor cars and of heavy cargo is increasing and the lack of a crane causes much inconvenience and delay. A fee will be charged for its use and the cost of purchasing it should be re covered in course of time. Manamah-Muharrak Road. Owing to lack of funds, it has been impossible to allocate a larger amount to- 6 - to this important undertaking. Should the revenue exceed the estimated amount an additional sum will be set aside towards building the road. Agriculture. It is proposed that some experiments in agriculture should be made on a fairly large scale by the sinking of several artesian wells in a suitable area. The State now owns a well boring machine and the amount shown under this heading is to cover the cost of boring and preparing the ground. ********General. Notes On Reven u e For 134 -8. The revenue for 1348 shows a very serious falling off. The is decrease/mainly in the Customs collections, the ch^jf revenue of the State. The reason is apparently general trade depression, an abnormally bad pearl season, which shows no sign of recovery, and, to a lesser extent, the disturbances on the mainland caused by the recent rebellion. There has been a noticeable decrease in the actual wholesale cost of most imports, except rice. Shortage: of money occasioned ^ne bad pearl season, has reduced the local purchase of most forms of luxuries. The following is a comparison of the revenue for the last five years. YEAR. TOTAJ.

The Customs collections are the real indication of the financial condition and they reflect the material condition of the ’-'t'-.t-. me totsl revenue includes such items as sales of lands etc. and so cannot be taken as a'genuine representation of revenue. 5’rom the year 1344 until this year there has been a steady increase in Customs revenue. This year it has fallen back to almost as low as it was in 1344, an admittedly bad year. Although the revenue was estimated in the 1348 Budget on a very conservative basis the actual receipts fell short of the budgeted amount by Rs. 32,Ono/-. Revenue collected by .the Customs Department includes boat, pearling and motor licenses and also^up till now, passport licensed These items have not decreased seriously.The collections of duties on ships 1 cargo etc. shows a falling off of Rs. 1,64,561/- as compared to last year f s figures. The loss of over a lac and a half is a very serious matter when the whole estimated revenue of the State, from all sources, for 1348 was about 10-g- lacs. The following comparison shows under various headings where the decrease ocurred- 1347. 1348. 1. Steamers cargo Rs. 6,25,786/- Rs. 4,88,674/- 2. Native Craft ' 1.00,091/- tt 1,11,011/- 3.

It can be assumed that about Rs. 50000/- of this decrease is caused by the delay in the arrival of a direct rice boat from Calcutta which would usually reach Bahrain before the end of the year. There has been a. decrease of about Rs. 30000/- in Customs Duty on silk and cotton piece goods partly owing to the deprivation of A about 25,'s in the wholesale price of these goods, and also owing to a diminished import for which the disturbances on the mainland are partly responsible.ihe reduction in the wholesale cost of coffee and sugar ’ has resulted in a decrease of Rs. 15000/- and Rs. 6000/- respective ly in Customs collections. The import of sugar is similar to • that of the previous year in spite of the increased vigilance of the Persian authorities. Local exports to Persian ports do not seem to have been affected as much as would have been expected, similar reductions m the wholesale price of grain and tea have reflected on the Customs collections and caused a decrease of about 25^ from the preTwjoSyear. native Craft shov/s a satisfactory increase of Rs. 10,920/- mainly due to the import of ghee by native craft instead of by steamers. Parcel duties sho?/s a decrease ofl almost Rs. 6000/- due to the decrease in importation of luxuries. Passenger Baggage shows a decrease of nearly Rs. 15000/- owmg to the fact that carpets and abbas are now worth about 40^ less than they were last year. The fall in the price of carpets^ presumably owing to the general trade depression, carpets being a luxury find no market when money is tight. Tne decrease of Rs. 10000/- in transhipment duty is mainly due to the recent war on the mainland which affected trade very seriously. Miscellaneous includes Rs. 3000/- being sale proceeds of unclaimed cargo as well as the Harbour flue of Rs. 10/- imposed on every motor passenger launch which is not registered in Bahrain ^nd which enters the port.

Previous state of Education. The Government schools, which previously consisted of one school in Muharrak and one school in Manamah, were founded about ten years ago by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, after his return from his first visit to England. Both schools were Sunni. Until this year they were nominally under Shaikh Abdullah’s direction, assisted by a Council of Education consisting of merchants chosen for their wealth rather than their learning. In practice they were managed by Haji Yusuf Fakhroo, the Treasurer, and Said Othman Hurani, the Syrian headmaster of the Muharrak school. A sum which finally reached Rs 3370/-, was paid monthly by the Government to the Treasurer, and no questions were asked as to education or accounts. Interference by the Government in school matters was considered impolitic. Originally about three lacs of rupees were collected from the public to start the schools. The building of the Muharrak school was supposed to cost two lacs, an incredibly large amount. Much publicity was given some years ago in the Egyptian press to the gross mismanagement of pub lic money by the Treasurer but nothing was definitely proved. Most of the teachers were appointed by the Muharrak headmaster, who introduced a number of his own relations; another member of the Council, the son of the notorious Shaikh Abdul Wahab Ziayanim, supplied a large proportion of the teachers from his own relations. Nepotism flour ished to an extraordinary degree and salaries depended not on the ability of the teachers but on their friendship with the headmaster and one or two members of the council.- 2 - It is hardly surprising that the standard of education was low and boys who had attended school for several years were incapable of doing the most simple work in any of the Governmen t offic e s. At various times incidents occurred which were commented upon in the foreign press which has always taken a some what impertinent interest in Bahrain educational affairs, probably owing to the number of foreigners who have held posts in the schools. An example of one of these 'Incidents” was the dismissal and repatriation of Shaikh Hafiz Wahba, who was a master in Muharrak, about years ago. This gentleman, who was thought at that time to be organising anti-English propaganda in Bahrain, now holds the important post of representative of King Ibn Saoud in England. Appointment of Inspector of Education . Towards the middle of the year, after the dismissal of the headmaster of ffea the Manamah school by the Council under somewhat irregular circumstances, Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa asked that the admin istration of the schools and the accounts should be under the direct supervision of the Government who should also appoint a suitable Inspector A Education to supervise the teaching. Mr. Faik Adham, a Syrian, was well recommended by the President of the Beyrout University and appointed to the post. He holds a B.A. degree from the University and a degree from the Islamieh College of Beyrout. He brought with him his wife, a qualified teacher, who was appointed as headmistress of the new Manamah girls r school. School masters strike . The appointment of an Inspector was bitterly resented by Othman Hurani and many of the masters as well as one or two of the Council. Previously they had mishandled educational affairs and accounts.with-3- with impunity. When certain irregularities in the accounts were discovered the Treasurer of the Council resigned. A regular system of accounts and payments was instituted. All these changes were very unwelcome to the headmasters of the schools. On find Ramadhan, 1348 without any warning, the head masters of Manamah and Muharrak declared a strike of masters • and boys. The students were harangued by the two head masters, the schools were closed and for several days the boys paraded about the towns making violent speeches in the bazaars which they admitted afterwards they had been taught by their masters. The masters took a solemn oath that they would stand together and several members of the Council were undoubtedly in favour of the strike and secretly encouraged it. Attempts were made to per suade the other schools to join the strike, but without success. Shaikh Abdullah immediately sent for the two headmas ters to call on turn at the Government offices. They refused to come. Later they sent a long letter making a number of impossible demands which included requests that their retention should be guaranteed and that they should be appointed members of the council. They were promptly informed in an official letter that until they returned to their duties none of their demands could be considered. They refused to go back to work unless every thing that they asked for was granted. They were both dismissed, their salaries were paid, and they were sent back to their homes in the Lebanon, via Muscat, Karachi and Busrah as there happened at the time to be a boat in the port on its way down the Gulf. A proclamation was issued closing the two schools for ten days. The dismissal of the two masters caused0?€$ J -4- caused a great deal of excitement. Public petitions were organised, deputations called the Shaikh and schoolboys broke into the Muharrak school and destroyed a quantity of furniture and fittings. The Kozaibis and others sug gested, as a threatjthat they would open a new school in opposition to the Government schools. 4 In ten days the schools were re-opened,at first the attendance was small but within a month it reached the normal number. Throughout the affair most of the parents of the boys protested that they did not approve of their sons f behaviour but they were powerless to stop it or to send them back to school. It is an actual fact that here in Bahrain, with a few exceptions, from the family of the Ruling Family downwards, quite small boys are absolutely independent of their fathers 1 wishes. Newspaper attacks . The departure of the two masters was promptly followed by a series of abusive and anti- English articles in Iraki, Persian and Syrian newspapers. Their vituperation was mostly directed against the poli tical agent in Bahrain and the British policy in Bahrain. The pe? reason for the masters dismissal was given as being their refusal to make English the teaching language of the schools, jealousy of the English at the success of the Arab schools and the wish of the English to forbid the teaching of religion. These, and other causes, all of them equally untrue, were circulated by the masters who remained in Bahrain. Shaikh Abdulla as President of Education, published a brief notice in f? Al-Iraq Tt ggl contra dicting the newspaper statements and stating the reason for the masters dismissal. Some articles were also pub lished giving a true account of the circumstances in respectable newspapers.-5- Pronosed Reforms . The chief fault in education uptill now has been an attempt to teach too many and too advanced subjects, which even if they are understood will be of no use to boys who will mostly become divers, boat owners or petty shopkeepers. The present curriculum includes: Algebra, Geometry, Chemistry, Physics, Music and English in five out of eight classes. Not only are these subjects useless but in most cases the teaching of them is badly done. Shaikh Abdullah, who, although he has only the elements of education himself, is a man of unusual intelligence, in consultation with the Inspector of education and myself has decided to make radical changes at the beginning of the next school year. The services of most of the present foreign masters will be dispensed with. By 'foreign” is meant persons from outside the Gulf. They will be replaced by four of the young Bahrain men who are being educated at Government expense at Beyrout University. Two new headmasters will be imported for Manamah and Muharrak, if possible one of these will be an 'Aalim' of some reputation but holding modern views. The names of two well known religious and educational personages in Syria have been mentioned. The rest of the masters will be local pupil teachers from the schools themselves. Efforts are being made to obtain a man to teach practical carpentry and another to teach agriculture. English will only be taught in the tvro or three top classes, the other subjects will be religion, Arabic grammar, reading and writing, history, geography, arith metic drawing and singing. Scouting will be introduced into the Manamah and Muharrak schools. The programme in the smaller schools will be more simple consisting of religion, reading, writing and arithmetic.- 6 - The present council of education v/ill be abolished and a new committee will be appointed consisting of Shias and Sunnis. This change, which has already been discussed with both parties, and approved by them, is an interesting political advance as some years back such a combination in a matter which concerns schools, in which questions of religion are involved, would have been an impossibility. The President, as before, will be Shaikh Abdulla, but the committee itself will have no power to decide the question of pay or of appointments of masters. It is hoped that when these changes are made the condition of the schools will improve and the public will not feel, as they do now, that a great proportion of the very large sums that have been spent on education up till now have been spent with very little result. The Shia Schools . The Jaffarieh (Shia) school in Man- amah has occupied its new building for over a year. It is managed by a committee, who are mostly illiterate but influential umder the presidency of Syed Ahmed bin Syed Aloui, a much respected Bahrain merchant. The Shia Kadi, Shaikh Abdulla bin Mohomed Saleh, an unexpectedly broad minded cleric, takes an active interest in its progress and frequently visits the classes. The teachers are mostly Irakis as the Shias in Bahrain are even less able to furnish educated men than the Arabs, never before having had schools of their own. The progress of the school has been fairly satisfactory although owing to quarrels among the committee, and some misunderstanding over the adjust ment of the classes, the attendance has diminished lately. There is a small subsidiary school at Suk al-Khamis, a centre near several villages, which attended by the chil dren of the fellahin. It is difficult to persuade them to educate their children as from a very early age they w«t.i-7- they work in the gardens. The Shia schools have not yet been brought under the supervision of the Inspector, except as regards finance, this will be done when the new mixed committee is appointed. The Manamah school has a troop of boy scouts, which is very popular, they have also a band which was given to them by some of the local merchants. Girls 1 schools . Only a few years ago the very idea of female education in Bahrain would have roused furious opposition. There are still many who disapprove of it. They say y seriously, as the main argument against it, that they do not wish their women to read or write because if they are able to do so they will correspond, privately, with persons who are not their legal guardians or masters. Apart from the ultra-conservative faction there is a large party of more enlightened Arabs, and foreigners, who of their own accord asked that there should be girls T schools. The first one was started in Muharrak, over a year ago, owes its its ewH/existence to Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa and partly to the well known pearl merchant, Mohomed Ali Zainal whose chief interest is education. The latter by talking to many of the leading people convinced them that such a the school was needed. When it was first proposed,Kadi of Muharrak denounced it in the Mosque at the Friday service. It is now a flourishing institution. The Manamah school was opened this year, in response to numerous requests. The headmistress is the wife of the Inspector of Education. She is a fully qualified teacher, trained in a college for school teachers in Syria. The school is attended by Sunnis and Shias and by Indians and Persians as well as the local people. The lessons consist of religion, reading writing and arithmetic and sewing and£6 - 8 - and embroidery. A number of girls who had previously attended the Mission school transferred themselves to this new Government school. The school is very popular and the attendance is as much as can be dealt with by the pre sent staff. Bahrain boys at Bevrout . The seven boys from Bahrain eefe schools who have been educated for two years, at Govern ment expense, at Beyrout University have been well reported on. Three of them, sons of Shaikhs, spent the last sum mer holidays in Bahrain. Their knowledge of English seemed to have improved* considerably. Doubtless the success of this experiment will be anparent when the boys return here at the end of the present term. four of them will then enter the schools as masters. The cost of this experiment has been heavy as although several of the boys are sons of wealthy parents wvery- thingi has been paid for them by the Government. The boys were selected at a time when I was on leave and in my opinion the choice of two or three of them was unfortunate. They are sons of people who are notoriously mischievous and inimical to the Government. They were chosen by one of the two headmasters who were dismissed.rlAt the time of the strike four of the boys at Beyrout sent to the masters a sympathetic and encouraging telegram. It is to be hoped that this no indication of their future line of conduct. Hussein Yateem, son of a local merchant, who died some years ago, is still at school at Brighton. From unofficial sources I hear that he is doing very well, he speaks English excellently and has apparently assimi lated the manners of an English school boy. Persian and American Schools. As these schools are notnot in any way connected with the G-overnment very little is known of their work. Originally there was one Persian school which has been in existence for about sixteen years. It fe&amp;e bees is subsidized by the Persian G-overnment and managed by a committee of local Persians. With the exception of one Mohamedan Indian the masters are Persian. Two years ago, owing to quarrels on the committee an opposition school was started. Both now continue to flourish. The schools have now drop ped their aggressively military attitude and no longer march about the town carrying Persian flags and beat ing drams. About sixty boys attend the two schools. The American Mission has a boys and a girls school. The greater proportion of the students are Jews and Persians; Arabs do not send their children as they dislike the possibility of their receiving religious teaching. The standard of education at the boys school is extremely high, they are taught by Mr. Hakken a member of the Mission, and an assistant and as the numbers are few they receive more individual attention than at the Government schools. The opening of the Shia school and the girls school in Manamah greatly reduced the attendance at both the American schools. Tutor for the sons of H. E. Shaikh Hamad. For several years the question of obtaining a tutor for Shaikh Hamad's four youngest sons has been under dis cussion. Eventually, about five months ago, Mr. Abdul Qayum Khan, a Mohomedan Indian, was appointed in this capacity. He holds a B.A. degree from Ajmer College, and was acting Tahsildar, Ajgier.■Bnanm mm, - 10 - Shortly after arriving he joined the Shaikh at Sakhir where he has been giving lessons to three of the younger sons, Shaikhs Mubarak, Daij and Ahmed. The boys do not take easily to education as until now they have never been bound to any regular routine. Considerable progress hov/ever has been made with Shaikh Mubarak who in three months has acquired some knowledge of English. He is also being taught the rudiments of Law and accompanied by the tutor he attends Courts in Manamah for instruction and has lately been appoint-e ed as a Magistrate on the Small Joint Court. The two younger boys are making slight progress. In addi-tion to their lessons from the tutor they are taught twice a week by the Inspector of Education. The tutor on his arrival could speak no Arabic, which was a serious handicap, but he has now acquired a working knowledge of that language. General . In Bahrain, as in many other places, Education is resented by the unprogressive religious party, especially by the Kadis and Mullahs. Their own know ledge is so slight that they are afraid of losing what prestige they have if the community, becomes more edu- cated. On several occasions the A Kadis, who are appo inted and paid by the Government have preached against education in the mosques. Otherwise education is generally appreciated by the public, especially by the ever increasing number of Arabs who travel abroad. Unfortunately the Ruling family, with a few exceptions, do not appreciate the necessity of educating their sons. The very slightest knowledge of reading and writing was sufficient for them in the past, and they seem to think that it will be sufficient for them in- 11 - in the future. One of their arguments against the need of education is that most of the biggest pearl merchants are uneducated and illiterate. This is true but it is well known that much of their money disappears in the hands of clerks and agents. The same applies to the Khalifah; if they had even sufficient knowledge to be able to keep accounts properly they would be very much richer than they are now. One of the most remarkable differences in the last year or two, which is not only confined to school boys, is the increasing popularity of out door games. All the schools have football teams which constantly play against each other, and there is also at least one regular football club. Two or three years ago people playing football would have been held up to ridicule, now they play every evening outside the towns. A most important result of the increase in education is its tendency to minimise the bitter animosity that exists between the Sunnis and the Shias. Before the present Shaikh came into power the intense hate of the shias for the Sunnis was concentrated in the Shia feeling against the Khalifah family. This feeling still exists, but mostly among the older men. That the Shaikh has given schools to the Shias, as well as to the Sunnis, and that he pays for their education, is genuinely appreciated by them, and the mixing on terms of equality of Sunni and Shia boys must eventually diminish the bitter feeling that used to exist between them. Education allotment during 1348 was Rs 90,000/— Actual expenditure ' RsJUDICIAL. 3 ^ Bahrain Court♦ Shaikh Salman bin Earned Al-Khalifa and She Adviser, No* of cases dealt with approximately, 2&gt; o o o tt Tt new TT tT 11 ^ o o Court fees collected @5 3 ^ • The Khalifa Murder Cases* The most important cases dealt with by this court during the year were the Khalifa Murder Cases, which included the unsuccessful attempted assasination of H* E. Shaikh Earned in 1926. The fact that the court was empowered to try the Khalil Shaikhs, and also to pass a death sentence in the case of another murder, has considerably strengthened its j ■ ■■ reputation and importance in the eyes of the people. The Khalifa Shaikhs who were convicted were, Shaikh Hamud bin Subah, previously prQgdident of the Mujlis ut Tijarah, Shaikh Hamed bin Abdulla Al-Ghatem and Shaikh Ebrahim bin Khalid bin Ali, a nephew ofl Shaikh Isa bin Ali. The actual murderers, or would be murderers_&gt;in all the cases were a gang of Hassawis and Uejdis under the leadership ofl a man named Mohamed A1 Mullah. These,men were ready to hire themselves out for any work of this sort. They resembled in fact a gang of Chicago Gunmen. They were undoubtedly responsible for most of the murders, attacks on villages and robberies with va.lence which occured in Bahrain during the last 10 years. Many of their exploits took place after the retirement of Shaikh Isa when conditions were somewhat disturbed and also immediately after the excitement caused when a Baluchi Levyman ran amuckyshot an Idian Officer and an Indian N.C.O. and wounded the Political Agent. ill though the men remained in Bahrain flmwB of them were■HiWHHWKHI A 3i - 2 - were suspected at the time until by chance one of them was Police and the imir of Manamah obtained clues as to the existence of the gang. One by one they were traced and MM&amp;M arrested. Police investigations revealed that the same men were implicated in a series of murders and dacoitry terminating with the attack on Shaikh Earned and a raid on a village two miles from Manamah shortly afterwards. The investigations required very careful handling. The position of the Police was extremly delicate as the principals in the crimes were members of the Ruling Family with influence in the highest places. Haji Salman, Superintendent of the irab Police, deserves particular credit for his work in the case and for the undoubted risks which he ran. Eventually the murderers themselves were tried in the Agency Court, being foreign subjects. Most of them confessed and they were found guilty and sentenced to various terms of penal servitude. The general public, with little knowledge of legal niceities, considered that the men should have been excuted especially because they had made an attempt on the life of the Ruler. During the trial one of the accused tried to escape and was shot down by the guards. In the course of the trials the accused gave evidence against the Khalifa Shaikhs who had ordered them to commit the offences. H. E. Shaikh Earned was informed of the accusations made against his relations and after some consideration he decided that they too should be tried, by the Bahrain Court, augmented for the occasion by Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa A1 Khalifa. Shaikh Kamud bin Subah was found guilty of instigating an attack on the house of one of his tenants at Tubli, eight years ago. The o?/ner of the house was killed. Ee was sentenced to pay Rs corresponding to 7 ^*^ 0 Riyials, blood money, according to Arab Custom. The son of the murdered man refused to accept it, demanding a life for a life, and though he was urged many times to take the money he persis- arrested a boat at the end of 1928. The Localpersistently refused to receive it. Finally this amount, and also the fine in the Ghattam case, was added to the amount subscribed by the public for building the new Shia School. The case had not been tired before,although at the time of the murder the witnesses and the relations of the victim, all of them ohias, were summoned before the Sunni Kadi. Their refusal to appear v/as apparently taken as an admission that they withdrew their case. Shaikh ilamed bin Abdylla A1 Ghattam had been previously ttied by Shaikh Earned for instigating murder, and rape, in the house o± one of his tenants at Farsia. The previous judge ment was ambigious and though a fine was imposed, there was some doubt as to the meaning of the judgement. The Court examined the whole case again, found the accused guilty and retified the previous judgement ordering payment of blood looney. The relations of the victim refused to take the money. bhaikh Ibrahim Bin Khalid was iound guilty of instigating the attempted murder of Shaikh Earned. At that time he was living on the mainland having been banished for fsr his comp licity in two murderous attacks on villages in Sitra. The ammunitions used against Shaikh Earned was sent by him to the leader of the gang and an incriminating letter from him was found in the house of one of the gang. The question of his punishment was referred to Shaikh Earned. For political and family reasons, and because the attempt had been made against his own life, Shaikh Earned granted nim a pardon. It is a matter of opinion whether this generous act of clemency was altogether well judged. Throughout the trials the Shaikhs adopted an insolent attitude indicating that they did not consider the court qualified to deal with them. Their only defence was obstinate denials of all evidence that implicated them. The trials caused a great deal of local interest. Fort Murder Case, In another murder case a ****'!***** young Bahrani, living un d-^r th. m - ■MB-4- •(-Jiq Porteuese Fort, was found guilty oi murnering his A neighbour's wife, with whom he had an intrigue. He was sentenced to death and excuted by shooting. Liquor Cases. The importation and consumption of any form of alcohol is forbidden in Bahrain. Unfortunately during recent years the illegal manufacture of liquor has increased very considerably. A number oi rains were made by the Police during the year and hea-vy sentences were imposed on consumers and makers oi liquor. Cultured Pearl Case. A case which attracted much attention both locally and outside Bahrain was one in which a local merchant was convicted of importing two cultured pearls, one of which he sold knowing it to be cultured. The merchant was a brother- in-law of Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa, brother of the Euler, and most unsuitable efforts were made by some 01 his highly placed relations to prevent a conviction. The case was brought by the Police and tried in the Bahrain Court. A committee of experts including the Continental pearl mer chants, was consulted as to the pearls themselves. The culprit, Abdulla A1 Zaid, was sentenced to pay a line oi Rs. 3000/- and forbidden to trade in pearls in Bahrain for thPee years_, /34^ * /2&gt;SQ. The imposition of this sentence was greatly appreciated by the pearling commmnity who realise the danger to their trade which results from traffic in cultured pearls. Siadi Estate Case. The most important civil case dealt with during the year was the Siadi Estate Case in which two cousins are the parties. Property and money exceeding in value seven lacs of Rupges are involved in theS case which has not yet been completed. The court fees alone, collected upX till now3i - -5- now, on the actual cash, amount to over Fifteen Thousand Rupees* Other courts consist of:- 1* Sunni Shera Court* presided over by the three Sunni Kadis. 2. Shia Shera Court , presided over by the Shia Kadi. 3. Bahrain Small Court , dealing with cases under Rs. 200/-. 4* Muilis Taiara .consisting of 22 leading merchants of which 11 sit each week under the presidency of a Shaikh of the Ruling Family dealing with questions of accounts and local mercantile customs. 5* Diving Court , consisting of two paid members and two honorary members who deal with diving cases and sit during the off season.-3- feet high. The walls are of large Murrabba Stones on the inside and the outside with a filling in the centre ofl Fishti Stone. They are not cemented. At intervals of 300 feet a double cross wall has been built and culverts will be inserted later on. It is estimated that the bridge will cost six lacs to complete, including the cost of a ferry over the deep channel close to Muharrak. About Rs. 12000/- has been expended upi till now. Notices were issued calling for tenders for filling in with Fishti but only one application was received, this was not accepted. Artesian Well. An artesian well was sunk for the Government between the Agency and the Government Offices by Mr. Khalil ^ Kanoo at a cost of Rs. 1400/-. A tank was built by the Government and pipes were laid giving a water supply to the Hospital, the Agency and the Government Offices, and also to the public. The first two wells which were sunk in Bahrain cost Rs. 50000/- each. The following less important works were carried out:- Compound wall round open reclaimed ground between Sea Road and Government Offices. Construction of Passport on the lower verandah of Police Station, A Construction of three corrugated iron garages. Roads. The main road from Manamah to Ruffa, as far as the end of the date gardens, has been thoroughly repaired to the distance of about 4-g- miles from the Muncipal boundary. Twelve culverts were rebuilt and widened and in many places banks of irrigation channels bordering on the road were reinforced. The road was resurfaced with clay and well rolled. A piece of road about 5 miles long which passes through the tombs on the Ruffa well has been cleared of loose stones wmmSibs _4_ i stones and greatly improved. The recent acqu&amp;sftion of a motor lorry has made road work much easier. 'If roads were metalled they would undoubtedly last longer but the initial cost would be high, a new and heavier roller would be needed ana tnere would be great difficulty in many places where no water is obtainable. Palace Garden. ihe artesian well in this garden has constantly given trouble. It appears to be leaking under the ground so badly that the area adjoining the well becomes a swamp and all cultivation perishes. The area of the garden has now been increased by including another piece on the northern side. ihe garden at present grows little else than dates and lucerne. Land Registration. There is a steady increase in applications for registration of sales and of titles although at present the registration is voluntary. The fee of each title deed is Ps. 10/-. The title deeds are on stout paper with a plan of the ground, on terro paper fastened to the back. A new scale Oi charges has been laid down which is to come into force in the new year by which fees on registration of sales to be charged on a scale according to the sale price of the property. No. of sales registered 262. M ' ,t titles tT 177. ( !T ” gifts ' 20. reports with survey plans submitted to the courts 14. government title deeds bear the signature of The Shaikh ano. are regarded as being inviolate by the courts. They are only sealed after careful examination and after public proc lamations which are exhibited in the case of registration of for titles/three months and in the case ofi sales for one month* These registrationsjfentail considerable work, the ground has to be surveyed and measured, water rights are verifiei mmmmm wmm m-5- ——H verbified, proclamations prepared and finally the title deeds are written and copied into the registers. I Government Lands. I Another branch of this department is the leasing of I Government land!, mostly on the edge of Manamah and Muharrak, I to persons who previously occupied it with no legal right or permission. The leases are very low, usually about Rs. Zj- I per month, and in many cases at a nominal amount of two Annas I per month, but the principle involved is important and prevents! much valuable property being lost by the State. 1 The question of tne vast areas of cultivat^able ground which are claimed by the members of the Ruling Family as their private^property, by virtue of scraps of paper recklessly issued^shaikh Isa gifting whole villages and the ground between them, has not been entered into yet. The matter is a pressing I one as lately some of these persons have sold pieces of this alleged property and others applying for registration. If this form oi ownership is admitted about three quarters of the land which appears to be suitable for cultivation in the Islands will be lost* The claimants make no use of the ground but if any of their tenants cultivate a small plot they ignore it for a year or two and then, when the cultivation begins to yeild an income they claim it as theirs. It would be difficult for the Government, even with The Shaikh f s approval, to repudiate the so-called title deeds while Shaikh Isa is alive. A possible solution of the problem would be the imposition of a land tax | on hhXlT uncultivated ground. Land Settlement. Four surveyors and one draftsman have been employed ior aoout half the year. Three of the surveyors are working ! in the country and have completed the survey of the following villages and cultivated areas; Boori, Saar, The Baria of Tashtasij .'&lt;ork in the gardens during the summer is very bad for the health ' mm- 6 - health owing to the quantity of mosquitoes so it is pronosed that the surveyors will commence work on Muhkrrak and Hedd early in the New Year.WAKF DEPARTIffiMS. @ ® Hi- Sunni Wakfs. The Sunni Wakf Department continues in an extremly unsatisfactory condition. The fakfs are administered by the three Sunni Kadis assisted by a minor Shaikh of the Ruling Kamily and a staff of clerks, all of whom receive salaries from the Government. Two of the three Kadis are elderly men with neither the ability lor the inclination to interest themselves actively in supervising the Wakfs estates which consist of many valuable gardens, house and bazar property in Manamah, Muharrak and Hedd, and a number of fish traps along the coast. Owing to lack of supervision the revenue is not properly collected and the expenditure is uncontrolled. Many of the rents are collected directly by the Imams of Mosques to which they are dedicated, and there is no check on the amounts collected or the way ini which the income is spent. Mosques which have property specially dedicated for lamps or mats or water are almost destitute of the requirements and it is a well known fact that the Walis divert the funds for such objects to their own pockets, numerous fakfs exist for non existent! schools, these also are absorbed by the administrators. It is a significant fact that the dedication of Wakfs has greatly fallen off, among the Sunnis, during recent years. The public are aware of this and the Government is much criticised for allowing such a state of things to continue, but any reforms in this direction should be instituted by the Ruler himself. Another fact which the public reseht is that the management! of the Wakfs is in the hands of the three Kadis who are also the Shera Court. Frequent disputes occur over the authenticity of Wakfs and these cases are referred to the Shera Court, Not unnaturally people think that the Kadis are liable to be biased in favour of the Wakfs which they themselves administer. The Kadis themselves receive a considerable income from Wakfs. ■■■■■■MB-tilUnless tne system of administration is entirely changed there is a small chance of f the conditions improving. Any enquiries into Wakf matters are strongly resented by the Kadis and also by the various Mullahs who are responsible for spending the money. • Shia Wakfs, The organisation of the Shia Wakf Department as an institution entirely unconnected with the Shia Kadi has been a surprising success. The Wakfs are managed by a committee of the leading Baharana from Manamah and the villages under the pres idency of beyed Ahmed bin Seyed Alawi. The Mujlis has his office m the Shia School. The members are men with practical knowledge of agriculture. The Mujlis has hki own account in The Eastern Bank. All Wakf property/MS registered and leased out by the Department which collects the rents and distributes payments to the persons who are appointld/falis. The Department insists on the production! of receipts for all money spent. Meetings are hela once a fortnight and all questions which cannot be settled ( by the members are referred to the Kadi. bach member is responsible for looking after the Wakf property in his district and for reporting any injury or mis management by the tenants. In addition to this a sub committee consisting of three members each working for a specified time, visited every piece of Wakf property in Bahrain and reported on them to the Mujlis. Owing to this inspection many of the leases were revised and many small gardens were entered in the register which had previously been ommitted. It has been possible during the year to set aside definite sums for the repairs of Wakf property, Rs. 6000/- was spent on work in date gardens which included the planting of a large number new date trees ana several mosques and Matarns were repaired, ihe Mujlis decided that for the present none of the innumerable uinea mooques are to be rebuilt but existing mosques which are in repairs are to be mepded. The inooe of the Shia Satf Dep--3- Department is about Rs. 30,000/- per annum but if the present administration continues it should increase to twice this amount in two or three years. The expenditure of a definite sum each year on repairs will certainly result in higher rents which the peonle are glad to pay for well cared gardens. All controversial matters are referred to the Kadi for his decision and although perhaps at heart he rather resents not having absolute control of the fakfs, as his predecessors had, he invariably gives the Department his help and support. The fact that he has no direct dealings with the Wakfs adds to his reputation of impartiality in cases in which Wakfs are concerned. The Department is very popular among the Shia Community as a whole. The success of the Shia Wakf Departmen serves tp emphasise the failure of the Sunnis in management of their Wakfs.MDNCIPiLITIES. 1. Manama. The Manama Municipality, notwithstanding an inclination to interfere frequently in matters which in no way concern it, has done a good deal of useful work during the year. Apart from the ordinary work of town cleaning and upkeep of roads the following improvements have been carried out. Bazaar Improvements. Several roads in the town and in the bazaar have been widened and opened up. In order to do this poritions of buildings and shops were demolished; In cases where much of the building is appropriated compensation is paid, otherwise the building is only repaired. During the last three or four years the Manama bazaar has changed to a remarkable extent, many of the narrow lanes have given way to broad streets where motor traffic is possible. The owners of the shops appreciate these improve ments, even though they have to sacrifice part of their property, as in every case the rents have improved where the streets have been widened. In addition to the work of the Municipality a number of handsome well constructed new shops and offices have been built by private individuals especially in the neighbourhood of the Pearl Bazaar. The road from the Municipal Offices to the Sea Road was rebuilt and macadamised. For this work an expert was hired from Basra. So far the result seems to be very satisfactory but the cost of the work was very high, the road 750 r I 21* cost Rs. 7601/** Local stone was used, but the tar was imported and the high cost of fuel in Bahrain, added greatly to the cost of the work. Sea Road. A new mud surface is being laid on the Sea Road. The eastern half was completed during the current year. Much inconvenience and even danger was caused on the Sea Road by person who were reclaiming ground inside the road leaving huge heaps of- 2 - bcH of stone on the side of the road. This now hesS been for- A bidden and four Slipways have been built which are used for carrying stone up from the sea sh^re into the town. The boats now unload stone on the shore below the road and it is carried MI up on donkeys directly to the place where it is required. A pier has been built on the centre of the eastern side of the road on which gutch and other building material can be stored until it is removed 14 into the town. Fire Stations. Six fire stations equipped with alarm bells have been made in various parts of the town. Previously when a fire ocurred it was the practice of the Nature to raise the alarm by firing their rifles, a dangerous and unsatisfactory method. Cemetrv fall. A disused cemetry behind H. E. Shaikh Hamed T s Palace was surrounded by a stone wall. The work was done by contract. Boring Machine. The Municipality shared with the Government in pur chasing a boring machine which is to be used in reboring several of the town wells which have run dry. Electric Light. Cu A separate note on this subject is attached. The Manama Municipality contributed 20fi of the total cost of the installation. Municipal Election. The election^took place towards the end of the year and for the first time they were organised according to a regular - system. All property owners in the Municipal area are eligible to vote. The different communities, Arabs, Baharana, Persians, Nejdis etc, each elected members, and a certain proportion were appointed by the Government. The system of ballot box and voting cards was instituted. An intense amount of interest was taken in the elections and 99$ of the eligible members of the ! community voted. The new Mujlis is a thoroughly representative-3- A2 representative one and includes most of tde leading men of Manama. Members who ha&lt;£&amp; sat on the retiring Mujlis were debarred from being re-elected by the Public but the Government retained the right of re-appointing them. Eventually only two of the old members returned. An indication of the interes taken in the elections was the fact that in some cases large sums of money were spent in endeavours to obtain votes. It was found that in the Hindu Community only three persons were entitled to vote, and in the Mohammedan Indian and Jewish Communities only about ten persons were eligible to vote. A letter was written by the President of the Mujlis to the members of these three communities informing them that owing to the smallness of their numbers their communities would be allowed to nominate a member from each community who would be accepted on the Council subject to the approval of the Government. The Jews accepted this concession and nominated munities refused to nominate anybody unless the clause in which the approval of the Government was mentioned was with drawn. The clause was nob withdrawn so there are now no Indian members on the Municipal Council. In spite of their own refusal to elect members it is understood that the reason for their non representation is being ascribed to political motives on the part of the Government. Muharrak. The Muharrak Municipality is a newer and a less wealthy institution than that of Manama and its work, although very useful, is less consppcious. It will take several years of regular scavenging before the back part of Muharrak town become; really clean. Seal Road. The most noticeable work carried out during the year was the construction of a sea road, similar to the one in Manama, along the foreshore of the town north of the Customs. a representative who was accepted, but both the Indianso -5- Arabs. iliis was the first regular election to be held in Munarraic and the local public appeared to take very small interest in it.General. Diving. ite 1348 pearl season was the worst that there has been for many years. The catch was a poor one and the market was abnormally bad_, the foreign buyers made unusually small purchases and when they returned to India most of the Bahrain merchants had not sold their pearls. The Bahrain merchants followed the buyers down to Bombay, failing to obtain better prices they refused to sell, the prices of pearls fell, the Bahrain merchants,instead of cutting their losses, held IMS on, Waiting xor the market to imrove. The market became worse t-nid tne xoreign buyers sailed for Burope leaving the Bahrain merchants with most of the year's catch in their hands. It is a fact that in many cases people who at first refused an offer were eventually unable to find buyers who would pay half of the original amount. When the new season drew near most of the Bahrain mer chants instead of coming back having sold their pearls and bringing the first instalment ot the price returned with money which they hafife recoi-ved by mortgaging their pearls with Indian iponey lenders in Bombay. Only three or four of the leading Bahrain merchants^ sold their goods, these include? Salman bin Mattar, Jsbar bin Mussalem, end Ali bin Sagar, the second of these was the tajar who financed in tne boat which brought/the record pearl. The pearl was even tually sold in Bahrain for £ 15,000/- to Mr. Habib, it changed hands in Paris for £ 35,000/-. The position is most serious for the small and medium men who nave no capital to fall back upon. The wealthy mer chants such as Kanoo and Gosaibis can afford not to sell for e season and by being able to lend money at a time when it is very difficult to obtain they can acquire an even greatei^control in hhhbbbbin the diving tpede whicli incre&amp;ses theip ppestige end power* state of pearl market is said to be the result of the disturbed condition of India, the recent financial crisis in America, and the increased production of cultured pearls. It is to be hoped that the conditions in India and America ?v r ill soon improve, but the cpiestion of cultured pearIsis not a temp orary matter f The authorities in Bahrain cannot prevent this trsue, out tney do all thatc^Bossible to prohibit the importation or circulation of cultured pearls in Bahrain so that Bahrain may acquire and retain the reputation of exporting only real pearls. The general condition of divers is gradually improving and this improvement is due entirely to the cc diving reforms*' whose beneficial results are now beginning to appear. Most of the older divers are so heavily in debt that only death will •free them, but the youger men who started to dive shortly before or after the diving reforms are no longer heavily in debt. They frequently earn enogh to cancel their debts so that they can dive 1 with whoever they wish to, and Quite a large proportion owe only four or five hundred Rupees which under the present system they should be able to nay ZSh off in three or four years. The merchants dislike the freeing of the divers very much indeed and I am sure that very shortly determined efforts will be made to revert to the old system. It is when the effects of the reforms become apparent that the critical time M will occur. A very harmful practice has crept in lately by which Nakhudas evade the regulations. The merchants make advances of money and hupH. to their divers charging heavy interest on m side account which is not checked by the diving clerks and is not entered in the divers books. The courts do not regard these debts as binding the divers to dive but the men themsl¥&amp;s are ignorant and many of them beleive that these side debts are as binding as the regular advances. The time for the Sallaf, which is the advance before the season ocurred at the end of the year. After the usual sfcaK-——i consultation with tne heads of the diving community the amount was settled at Rs, 80/- for a diver and Rs. 60/- for a puller, in each case Rs. 20/- less than last year. A proclamation was issued but the divers refused to go out on this amount. The persons who had first asked for this amount to be laid down requested from the Government that an increase should be made. There was a certain amount of trouble and some danger of disorder, though none actually ocurred. Finally it was settled that each diver might take an advance, up to Rs. 20/-, from his tisgam allowance at the end of the season. At this time a number of Nakhodas urged Shaikh Hamad to revert to the old state of things and to allow unlimited and unregul ated advances* The prevention of the unlimited advances and the institution of regular amounts laid down by law were t?/o of the most important features of the Reforms* A Aagnificant proof of the value of the Reforms is the fact that quite lately the Euler of Qatar instituted diving laws in his country on the same lines as those in Bahrain. In connection with the diving question it is interest- ing to notice that Lady Simon, in her book TT Slavery n quotes from Dr. Harrison’s 'Arab at Home Tt stating that divers neverg get out of debt and that in seven years he never met a diver who had freed himself. Dr. Harrison’s book was written about five years ago HI ; his remarks on divers debts, and various other matters, wrere probably true at that time but they are not the case now. El ectrification of Manamah. The project of introducing electricity into Manamah has been under IM consideration for five years or more and for some time funds were aet aside in Bombay for the purpose. /Au Until 1928 nothing definite was done ini the matter* In that year the Bahrain Government obtained from the Governmenhj of India the services of Mr. Stevenson, Electrical Inspector in Sind, who spent some time in Bahrain and prepared a scheme for the lay out with plants and a rough specification. TheThe question of supply and demand was gone into and it was ascertained that about 2000 lamps and 200 fans would be required, including street lights and Government buildings. The yarp happened to be a good one, financially* since then were two of the local merchants whose requirements/among the larg est have gone bankrupt, and many others are now in a somewhat critical MM financial position. A Public meeting was held in Manamah and it was decided that a company should be formed in which the Government and the Manamah Municipality and the general public were each to have an equal share and equal control. The local merchants, as representing the public, declared their willingness to purchase shares. Later on, for various reasons, the idda of a company was found to be unfeasable and the suggestion was cancelled. Copies of the plans and the specifications prepared by Mr. Stevenson were forwarded by the Government to the leading electrical firms in India and Irak with a request that if the undertaking interested them they should prepare tenders. Most of the firms replied that they could ft**- not tender^the whole scheme but could undertake part of it, this did not suit the requirement of the state, others appeared to consider that Bahrain was too far off the beaten track for them to work in. Messers. Callender T s Cable &amp; Construction Co. Ltd,, however v/ere prepared to tender for the whole scheme and on their own initiative they sent represent- A ative to visit Bahrain. In the summer of 1928 I was in England on leave. I had a number of meetings with Mr. Stevenson and with him I called upon several of* the firms ¥/ith whom we had corresponded through their Indian agencies.

In Sepetember, 1929 Mr. Jordan of Callender’s, arrived as their iiesidentt engineer with some of his workmen, others arrived later.

Lntil now no such people have been imported and the Public hade placed all their orders in the hands of Callender's Cable &amp; Construction Co. Ltd., The wiring of Government buildings, rslbce, Customs etc., including an ire light on a seventy five feet standard to be placed on the peer, amounted to about X Rs. 15,000/-. It had been proposed at first that the Shiakh's Palace, which is only occupied for about four months of the .w--.-.:, snould be provided for^by a subsidiary engine. On further consideration it was decided to extend the main supply to the Palace. The extra distance was about 2000 yards, some surplus material was utilised But, the extra poles and cables cost Rs. 10500/-, including the 7/ork of erection and an addition si transformer Kiosk inside the Palace itself. Arrangements were made with the A. P. 0. C. for a regular supply mil of fuel to be shipped monthly from Abadan to Bahrain on S. S. 'Kuzistan', but unfortunately we were informed by them that no voyages would be made during July and August. It was therefore necessary to purchase an extra oil tank which was obtained from Karachi.A small tanker was built in Bahrain consisting of a Jaliboat with a wooden tank which so far,seems to be a success. Messrs. Callender's offered &lt;tn provide an adequate staff, including an engineer, for twelve months, charging 10% over their actual pay. The offer of Asiatic staff was refused. A Power House suprintendant and two engine drivers who were personally known to and recommended by the Engineer were obtained from India direct.

Tt is estimated that the ouside cost of running, including pay of engineer at Es. 1250/- per month, will be Rs. 31,600/- for the first 12 months. The revenue during the first 12 months is estimated at the same amount. It is veiy unfortunate indeed that the first year of tne elcetric supply should be a year when there seems likely to be abnormal trade depression in Bahrain, undoubtedly numbers of people who would ordinarily have installed electricity in their shops and houses are deterred from doing so by lack of funds. Up till now about 1200 lights and about 200 fans, including street lights and Government buildings, have been def initely oraered or actually installed. I beleive in an ordinary season perhaps half as many again would have been ordered. enclosed is the Budget for the electrical supply for the lirst year but it is inevitably a somewhat problematical estimate as electricity is an entirely new thing in Bahrain and it is diffi cult to judge how much will be actually used by the local pop ulation. Quarantine. The Quarantine Gamp which is on the sea shore in the suburb ox Kozaibiah south east of Manamah town was reported by the Medical Officer to be unsuitable owing to a number of new houses having been built in the neighbourhood. After lengthy negociation the Bahrain Government sold the camp to the Royal Air Force for the sum of Rs. 13,000/-, which includes the foreshore between the camp and the sea. The R. A.

The place is at present occupied by servants of Shaikh Isa.. Theses people are to be removed to a. site on the shore north of Muharrak where they will be given some land and fully compensated for being moved. The position is a very suitable one; it can be reached by boats at all tides, it is connected to Muharrak by a narrow isthmus, it contains an artesian well and there is a large amount of stone which will be used for the new buildings, the remains of the old Arab fort of Gala Bu Maher. Nota ble Visi tors. In the middle of December the Hondble the Political Resident paid his first visit to Bahrain and various official functions were arranged for the occasion. In February H. M. King Ibn Sac d paid a sudden visit to Bahrain leaving a few hours after his arrival. Towards the end of the year Sheikh Mohamed bin Khal^fan, of Asalow, came to Bahrain and remained for about two months. His purpose was to borrow money. He was given a loan of Rs. 5000A until after the Diving Season. Other visitors included the following- Shaikh Juma bin Maktoom of Dubai. !t Rashid TI Khalfan Tf Shargah ft A li 11 luma TI Br^imi. tf Jaber tf Mohamed ft Asalow. ft Alleg tf Earned It M agabs. tt Mobumed Tt Saleh tt Oharak. ft tT n Isa Tt Muscat. aw asir. There has been no further influx of Dawasir, nor, in myin my opinion, is it likely that there will be at present, ohainn nbdiil Lattif, the head man of the Section of the tribe who are living at Budaya, has lately become somewhat childish, he has incessant quarrels with his sons and is heavily in debt. The Shaikhs 01 the Dhammam Section frequently visit tneir property in Bahrain and occasionally hint that if they were granted special concessions and privileges they might consider returning to Bahrain. Ahmed bin Abdulla, the son of the late Shaikh of the tribe, is mainly responsible for thi attitude* h. E. Shaikh named still thinks that they mean to return. The part 01 the town which is not occupied is becoming each year more ruinous. Boa t Making. This is almost the only local industry in Bahrain, apart from pearling. In spite of a bad financial year 78 sailing boats were built locally and 28 motor launches. In order to encourage the launch building industry the duty on British manufactured marine engines on launches fitted in Bahrain is remitted to the importers. By this concession it is hoped that Bahrain will be established as a centre of this industry.BAHRAIN, t &lt; 6th Nwyember 1930. Nf&gt;» D.0» 6S» In connection with the remarks in annual report for the last year about the Bahrain boys who have been educated at the American University of Beyrout for two years, it may interest you t© hear further developments Before the boys returned at the end of the term it was decided that they were not t® be sent back to Beyrout. fhis decision was made partly for financial reasons and partly because it was decided that the education of these boys at Beyrout, at an American University^where the teaching language was other than their own, was not altogether to be recommended. The parents of the boys were notified of this fact and Shaikh Hamed himself wrote a letter t® each parent saying that when his son returned he would be expected, if s© required, to^ work as a teacher in one of the Government schools. Several of the parents expresaedthe opinions that they had no wish whatever far their sans to go^o Beyrout. The boys arrived and and at once caused a considerable amount of criticism by expressing what were considered in Bahrain as being improper and irreligious views; they apparently told their relations that the usual Mohamedan farms of warship were old fashioned and unnecessary. The sons of Shaikhs ^©hamed and Abdulla are shortly to be married and apparently their parents had decided beforehand of their own accord that they did nat wish the boys t© return to Beyrout. / The son of Shaikh Ibrahaim bin ^ohamed, who had done one yearmili!e at Beyrout than the others^, was anxious to return there. He is a hard working young man but slow and not very intelligent. His own relations all consider that if someone else had gone instead of him more satisfactory results would have been achieved. His knowledge *f English is poor and he is very bad at mathemat^ However as he was s© anxious to continue his studies it has been arranged for him to join the Baghdad Government school where he will be partly assisted ©ut ©f Government funds. He left ^ for Baghdad about a month ago. The teaching language there is Arabic not English and I hope he will get on better than he did ~The other boys, who are sons of local merchants, called on me twice after their return. Their spokesman and leader is a youth called Ahmed bin 0 M ran.

Finally, after several interviews, the son of the Kadi, who has several relations in the schools, agreed to work as a master. Hone of the others h-'v.e accepted the pasts. 'Shaikh Abdulla himself was extremly angry at their attitude and told them exactly what he thought of them.

The amount spent on educating these boys was about Rs 50 ;QQ and'at prosent I, personally, see very little public advantage from this very large sum which has been expended.

Sir 9 du I have the honour to forward herewith in Explicate Arabic a report on the progress of the Bahrain State during the past year which has be- n sent me by Mr Pelgrave, Financial Adviser to His Ex- cellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa. The report is most interesting, and gives an excellent resume of the finances of the State and the events of the past year. I fully agree that the trials of the al Thaiifah which he mentions and their convictions have done a great deal to strengthen the hands of the Bahrain Court, and I alluded to the matter in my Administra tion report. It is a matter for profound regret, however, th t more productive work wag not undertaken during the years of plenty, and now that the lean years have come money can ill be spared except for immediate needs. The Customs, the ragne pain of the Bahrain State, urgently needed extensions to its pier and better shelters and faci lities for handling cargo, and even the v&lt;ear and tear of the trolly lines has not been made good. Still, there is xaxasnaxix nothing to be gained in regretting the past, and one can but hope that tne State will profit by the lessons of experience.

Dated &gt; r. iat«» From The Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith the annual report of the Bahrain State for 1349 together with new Budget for 1350. This is the sixth budget which I have had the honour of submitting to you. The year 1349 has been a very disastrous one finan cially, the revenue of the State has decreased to an alarming extent. With the exception of work on the Manamah-Muharraq. road, the building of the Quarantine and the payment of the balance of the Ifeinamah Electric scheme, no important new works have been carried out. It has been necessary to draw on the funds, which are invested in Bombay, to the extent of Rs 1,70,000/-. At the end of 1348 the total balance of the State T s funds was fa 3,40,365/- not including Rs 300,000/- reserve. At uke ena of 1349 the total balance was Rs l,l3,856/-/2. a nd a reserve fund of Rs 3,00,000/-. ® len making the budget for 1349 I was aware that the year was likely to be a bad one and therefore I allowed a decrease in the revenue of Rs 83,000/- less than- 2 - than the actual receipts of 1348. Unfortunately the decrease in 1349 exceeded my estimation by Rs 2,33,000/-. The reason for this serious falling off in revenue is not a local one but has been caused by the effects of the present world wide trade depression which parti cularly affects a luxury trade such as the pearl industry on v/hich depends not only the prosperity but almost the very existence of Bahrain. I feel confident that when trade conditions improve in Europe and imeriea there will be a similar improvement in Bahrain but until this occurs the revenue of the Bahrain State will decrease. The estimated expenditure in the new budget has been confined to the narrowest limits consistent with carrying out the bare administration of the State but in order to obtain the revenue for doing this it has been necessary to increase the Khanchia duty by an amount which is estimated as being likely to produce one lac of rupees as a temperary emergency measure. 'This matter is fully explained in the notes on the new Budget for 1350. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Financial Adviser to Bahrain Government. Adv/N.BUDGET - 1350 * * * gftvenue. Customs receipts include the % customs duty, which is the main source of revenue, pier fees, biladya tax and the royalty paid by the Landing Company to the State. The budgeted figures have been estimated by me after considering the actual receipts of the first ten months of 1349, owing to my proceeding on leave before the end of the eleventh month I am unable to examine the figures for the whole year. For the first ten months of 1349 the customs receipts, excluding Khanchia, were Rs 4,62,000/-. I have estimated in the Budget for 1350 that the customs receipts excluding Khanchia, will show a decrease of Rs Rs 14.000/- throughout the completed year, when compared with the 1849 collections, presuming that the last two months 1349 produce a similar average to the first ten months of that year. On customs receipts of Rs 5,40,000/- which is the esti mated amount for 1350, the Khanchia at the existing rate would amount to Rs 60,000/- thus bringing the total customs receipts up to six lacs only for the whole year* This six lacs, with the addition of the other items of revenue which the State derives from all other sources would then fall short of the required sum which is absolutely necessary to cover the ordinary recurrent expenditure, which has been reduced to the very minimum amount, by one lac of rupees, without drawing again heavily on the Reserve fund it would be impossible to cover the ordinary expenditure during the coming year. The Revenue must be raised by one lac of rupees. On examining the State’s present sources of income, apart- 2 - apart from customs, I find that there are none which can be reasonably raised or which could produce anything near the amount of extra revenue which is required. These other sources of revenue in themselves only amount to about one sixth of the estimated customs revenue. I consider it inadvisable to tamper with the present 5$ ad valorem customs duty on imports. A flat rate has much to recommend it; it has been fixed by treaty and also being a low rate it creates a satisfactory impression among infe intending importers, though this is perhaps somewhat of an illusion as including all incidental dues and fees to the Landing company etc. almost 7-g^ is now paid on imports before they reach the market. There remains the Khanchia. The Khanchia fee is somewhat in the nature of Demurrage, or a warehouse due. It is in the first place collected on all imports which are then allowed to remain in the customs wHarehouse for ten clear working days excluding holidays. On the expiration of this ten days if the imports are not re moved another Khanchia charge is levied and the goods may remain for a further ten days, in practice this^frequently done. The Khanchia is levied according to a list of set rates which were decided upon many years ago by the local merchants, the rates are very inconsistent and appear to have been made with no regular system. It is proposed to charge a new rate of one anna per maund on all bag cargo from the beginning of 1350. This increase will produce an additional lac of rupees which will balance the budget. It will be clearly indicated that this is entirely an emergency measure. If trade improves after lo5Q, or if the necessary amount is realised before the end of 1350 this addition will be withdrawn and the rate will-3- will revert to a iiodiiied i orni or to the previous rate. Apart from the present necessity of increasing the Khanchia there is a real need of revising the charges on other cargo as well as cargo and curing this emergency ueriod this revision will be dealt with. The increase will undoubtedly cause a general outcry among the merchants but it will scarcely raise the cost of living as for instance in the case of rice, which is the largest import affected, the additional duty will only add 2 annas to the cost of one bag of rice. at present it is proposed to apply the increase only to bag cargo, which forms 70% of the whole cargo af#ee but when the rates are permanently revised the revision should apply to all sorts of cargo. It is unfortunate that it should be necessary to increase tasation but at the same time it is a well known fact that’ Bahrain is more lightly taxed than any other State in the jU.1i . With the exception of the customs duty and a local nouse tax in Manamah and Muharrak which collected by the Municipalities there are no local taxes whatever. me revenue from other sources such as pearling licenses etc. has been estimated at a correspondingly low rate owing to the expectation of another bad year* Under the present conditions it would be rash to expect a larger income from these headings. ihe item 'Loans Recoverable' includes sums lent to local merchants and also Rs 2500/- which was unfortunately lent to a .Persian Shaikh, Shaikh Mohomed bin Ahmed Al-Harami who is now supposed to be in very serious financial difficulties* It is in opinion very doubtful whether this sum will be repaid. Ihe dangerous practice of lending money without interest and without security will not be continued in future.BUDGET - 1350. The expenditure for 1350 has been reduced to the very minimum amount end no provision has been made for any deve lopments or new undertakings. The total expenditure Rs 832,516/- represents the ordinary recurrent expenses of the State including such items as medical and educational works, public sucurity etc. etc. I. Allowances to Ruling Family . According to the correspondence which has passed on this subject the Civil List has been reduced by 10% and all the additional allowances have been cancelled, the total expenditure under the heading, after the reductions is slightly over half the whole esti mated revenue of the State for 1350. II* hrorection . The estimated expenditure on protection has been diminished by about Es 30,000/- less than last year T s allocation by means of a large reduction in the Indian Police force and a slight reduction in the naturs. The Budget allows for a force of 50 Indian ranks, with the Commandant of Police and Indian Officer, and a force of 50 local police with Superintendent and about 125 naturs. HI .Government departments . The total allocation for this heading shows a reduction of about Es 12,000/- in compari son to the previous year, this has been achieved by a reduction in the number of the staff. IV. Education . A reduction of Rs 10,000/- under this head ing is mainly obtained by the State no longer having to pay Tor the education of Bahrain students at Beyrouth Medical . A reduction of Rs 9,000/- has been made by deciding not to send the hospital boat out to the pearl banks Tor lour months but to arrange for the Indian doctor en tour The banks in a motor launch, three times during each month of The pearling season. kunici-p alities.

ETatE 0l&lt; TEE TRADE. In the annual report for 1348, it was stated that the season was the worst there had been for man T years. ihe 1348/49 season has been far more disast rous than the previous one and it is said that the market has not ooen so bad for over twenty years* The catch was not a good one but the real reason for the slump is owing to the present world wide commercial depression which affects a purely luxury trade even more seriously than it has affected ordinary commerce. The foreign buyers who bought pearls in Bahrain last sea son sold only a small proportion of them in Europe but in spite of this most of the big buyers returned to Bahrain in 1349 including Mr. Victor Rosenthal, Dr. Bienenfield, Mr. Pack, Hilal al Materi of Kuwait and several Indians. Mohomed Ali Zainal came to Bombay very late and did not visit Bahrain. At the time of the buying season in Bahrain the financial situation in Paris became very critical. Mr. Habib, formerly a big buyer in Bahrain, was reported to have become bankrupt, Mr. Pack left very hurriedly for Paris and the pearl market practically closed down, very little business having been done during the season. Only three or four of the Bahrain merchants sold and the remainder were left with this year f s and most of last year T s stock on their hands. Again a number of the Arab merchants followed the foreign buyers down to Bombay, but they have found the market there equally dull and several of them are contemplating taking their pearls themselves to Europe in the hope of finding buyers. Owing to last year f s bad season the small and medium merchants were badly hit, this year the big merchants as well have been seriously affected and at present only two or threethree of the leading pearl merchants are in possession of any iuno.s. rhey all hold large stocks of pearls which they cannot sell at present even at a great loss. Debts and ins talments are not being paid and merchants who two or three years ago could easily command several lacs of rupees are now hardly pressed to find a few thousands. If one of the big men failed he would pull down with him in his fall numbers of others. THE TESQUM ADVANCE. At the end of the diving season the usual trouble ocurred over the Tesquam advance. As stated in the previous report at the beginning of the season the divers went on strike and refused to go out unless the amounts were raised. The government increased them in order to pacify the divers. At the time of the Tesquam, some months after the cloi^se of the diving, the merchants who finance the industry were un doubtedly suffering from the effects of two bad years. H. E. Shaikh Hamad ordered Shaikh Sulman and the Adviser to hold a meeting of the leading men in the trade, suggesting himself that as usual a definite sum should be fixed for the advance and those who were unable to pay it should release their divers for the next season. It was decided at the meeting that the advances should be Rs 55/- and Rs 45/- for diver/ and puller respectively but the suggestion that those who could not pay should release their divers to dive with any Hakhuda who would pay them^raised most violent opposition^so it was settled that if the Nakhuda could mot give his diver the authorised advance he should give him a ?f Barua* allowing him to dive with any one else but paying l/4th of his earnings to the original Nakhuda to whom he was in debt. This was a slight variation of the usual custom by which a diver is released on a VBarua tilth 17 , paying l/3rd instead ofof l/4th to his original Nakhuda. Jabr bin Msallem, one of the biggest men in the trade, ownei of obout t-nirty boats, wa.s away when the meeting ocurred witu oiu.iivii iiouuxla oin Isa* A proclamation was issued accor* ding to the terms arranged at the meeting. Shaikh Abdulla and Jabr bin Hsallem returned. Hone of the Hakhudas gave their divers any advances neither did they give them 'Baruas' and deputations of merchants called on the Shaikh asking him to revise the proclamation. The divers complained and several hundreds of them marched outeto Sakhir to see the Shaikh, however he sent them a message telling them to go back to Manama. There was a. certain amount of alarm in the bazaar. The following day H. E. Shaikh Hamad came to Manama. He took a very strong line, decided that the rights of the divers were being abused by the merchants and himself drafted a proclama tion ordering the advances as laid down to be paid within live days failing which the government would release all divers who were not paid their advances, and allow them to dive freely during the next season. The suggestion of the !T Baruas' r for l/4th or l/3rd earnings was cancelled. About half the divers were paid their advances, though in most cases not the full amount, many thousands were given free baruas by the government, and the remainder were either given baruas by their nakhudas or came to an agreement with them THE SELAB' hJJVAHCE. The next advance will be due about a fortnight before the diving starts, this year the Rekba will /ik ' , /£ / *v be on Muharram, the feyofr day of 1350. It is quite impos sible for trade to revive before then so it is expected that ftost of the Hakhudas will release their divers in which case very few boats will go out for the new season. The Selafieh system, for the time being, will almost cease and divers who can G °llect a few hundred runees will hire a boat and go outout ^or snort sporls on tne KhainiEiQ.s systonij which, menns thst they will take no advances and the Nakhuda will receive l/5th of the profits. This system has to* much to recommend it and is almost universally practised on the mainland. It is free from many abuses that exist : in the Selafieh system, the divers themselves obtain a fairer share of the profits without increas ing their debts to their Nakhudas, but it is not popular with the Tajaas as they have no prior claim on the catches end they lose their hold on the divers. PROSPECTS fOR COMING- SEASON. Owing to the decrease in the b© boats which will probably go out diving in the coming season it is likely that the catch will be very small, although this will affect the divers very badly, and cause much want and unemployment, it will be perhaps advantageous to the industry as a whole. The pearl banks will be less/ disturbed for a season and may therefore produce better results the fol lowing year, when it is to be hoped the market will have returned to normal condition, the unsold stocks of pearls which are now held by the Bahrain merchants are sufficient without any ne?/ pearls, to supply the market for a year. COMPARISON OF SEASONS 1347/l348 and 1348/49. From figures obtained from the officially recognised diving clerks of Muharrak and Hidd a fairly accurate estimate of the results of the two seasons can be obtained. Many of the biggest boat owners keep their own diving clerks but the following statistics are from 249 boats whose accounts are dealt with by the Diving clerks. . 1347/48 1348/49 Total number of bo&amp;ts which went to the bakks from Bahrain. 538 509 249 boats: total value of sales 1847/48 - Bs 27,09,000/- If do 48/49 - 10,50,000/- This sum. represents the value of the pearls obtained by the Ifakhudas of the boats which is divided amcmnCi the NakhudaHaknuda and the Clivers, It does not represent the real value of the pearls as before they reach the final purchaser in Bahrain they often change hands several times and are frequently sold &lt;jnd lesola again in India* As an instance oi this miring a previous season a record sized pearl Y/as found which was bought by the taja^from his Nakhuda for Rs 75,000/-. It was eventually sold, during the same season, in Bahrain for about Rs 200,000/-. trom these ligures it is shown that the original amounts paid to the Makhudas for their pearls amounted to less than half the prise paid last year. The proportion of this decrease v/hich is owing to the bad market and that owing to the smallness of the catch cannot be differentiated. The Catch Wa.s Scio. go be a poor one, not as good as the previous year f s. It can be assumed that the remainder of the sales were proportionally the same. Out of 249 boats only the divers of three boats received any shares in the profits, the rest of the beats paid no dividends as the expenses not only swallov/ed up the whole of the profits but exceeded them so that at the end of the season the divers received nothing, but their debts to their Uakhudas increased. These expenses include advances ana interest on the same, cost of rations, licenses and also the hakhuda’s share from the sales, what remains is supposed to be divided among the divers. DIVERS 1 DEBTS. One poor season, one bad season and the prospect of another very bad season will have an unfortunate efiect on the important question of the gradual reduction of divers T debts. From the time of the diving reforms until 1346 there was a steady decrease in the amounts owing to the Ndkhudas by the divers, but from 1347, there has on the whole been an increase though owing to the government’s policy ofof restricting the advances they will never assume the dimensions which they used to and if two or three favour able seasons were to occur all the younger divers would become free of debt though the older men and are many of them, will never be able to pay off the huge amounts which they ere still supposed to owe.POLICE MD PUBLIC SECURITY'. In spite of lack of employment and general poverty there have been very few serious crimes during the year. Several prosecutions were made against persons for manufacturing and selling liquor but apart from these most of the cases dealt with by the Bahrain courts were for theft, assaults and im morality. The greater proportion of crimes are committed by foreigners and so are not dealt with by the Bahrain courts. On the whole the general state of public security is better than it has been for several years so much so that it has been possible to withdraw the local, guards from the village of Senabis which during previous years was raided several times. Ho. of Police prosecutions during 1349 - 378, Owing to the undisturbed condition of the country which is undoubtedly the result of continuous stable government, it has been possible to make certain changes in the Policee force. The Indian Police are being gradually reduced and the local Police are being proportionately increased by which a considerable saving has been made in expenditure on public protection. It is proposed that by degrees the whole of the Indian force shall be substituted by local men. Originally the Indian Police Force consisted of 110 men and the local police amounted to about 20. There are now 05 Indians and 30 local police. During the first quarter of the new year the Indians will be redu ced to 50 and the local Police will be increased to about 60. When sufficient suitable men have been enlisted in the local police they will be gradually put through a course of intensive training. Previously it has not been possible to 1° tnis as the numbers were insufficient to allow for a whole motion to be relieved of their duties while being trained. ■^t present a section of local police are quartered at Hedd a nd detatchments of Indian Police are stationed at Muharrak,Muharrak, Rafaa and at whatever place H. E. Shaikh Hamed happens to be residing in, a guard is also provided for the Political Agency. The jail duties are now carried out by local police instead of, as previously, by the Indian branch. These various duties, together with the bazaar patrols ab sorb most of the force but leave sufficient number of men available as a reserve in the fort. I consider that the present force is (piite sufficient for the ordinary local needs. Originally the old Levy Corps was intended to provide a force against possible attacks on Bahrain from outside. It was at one time considered quite likely ixiao the Dawasir might muse an armed attack on Bahrain. I am personally of the opinion that there is no likelihood whatever of this ochrring, The present force is quite suf ficient for the internal needs of the State and as it has aLrays been assumed that if Bahrain was made the object of an attack by a foreign state the British Government would com®.'to its assistance. I consider it unnecessary for the State to incur heavy expenditure on a more powerful and effective military force than is available at present./ LJVID DEPiBTMENT. Land Keg istration.

Date gardens especially are being sold at half the price which they would have realised during the previous year. The numoer of sales has also diminished very considerably. Besides the registration work this department submitted 15 reports with plans to the Courts in connection with land cases. In spite of efforts made by various people including /including iii^iily placsci lUGiubsps of th.6 Khalifoh. iamily to set aside Government title deeds H. E. Shaikh Earned adheres to the policy of never cancelling a title deed when once it has been signed after the proclamation has been issued call in i or claims on the property* The value and the integrity of tne whole system depends upon this and since the immutability of government title deeds has now been established their value is thoroughly appreciated by the public. Ihere has Deen an increase in the number of applicants who claim ownership by right of occupancy for over 13 years and a large proportion of their applications have been regis tered. The right by occupancy can only be claimed if the appli cant can prove that he lived on the ground, without paying rent and without vacating it, for ten years from 1336 so each ^rear the period increases. Land Settlement . (Land Registration and Settlement — total expenditure — its 21,355/lQ/~. ) -he towns of Muharrak and Hedd were surveyed during the year, trie various sheets which include the Muharrak survey have been reduced to the scale of 200 f x l ?f and a map of the town has been made similar to the map of Manamah. •The villages of Saar, Draaz, Qarriyah, Tanabiah,. Beni Jamra, Markh, Hamalah and Damistan, on Manamah island, have been surveyed. The records of rights of these villages has not yet been prepared as the question of plots of cultivation in the pos session of the Bhia fellahin of the villages, which are claim- e T by members of the Ruling family, has not yet been decided. Last year when the village of Barbar was surveyed Shaikh Lohomed bin Isa al-Khalifah claimed that all gardens in the-3- the district for which the owners held no documents were his by right of a gift paper in which Shaikh Isa bin Ali gifted him the district of Barbar. In order not to raise the ques tion no further steps were taken in the registration of rights in that area. This question is one of great importance. At present almost all the ground in Bahrain which is capable of culti vation is claimed by various members of the Ruling Family who make no use of it and prevent any increase of cultiva tion in the islands. If the Shia fellahim had the oppor tunity they would gladly cultivate a large area of ground by means of small wells which they axe capable of making themselves. Many of the claimants consider that not only the open ground belongs to them but also all the patches of culti vation, or dulabs, which in most cases existed before the gift documents vrere signed. One of the few members of the Ruling family who does mot make these claims is H. E. Shaikh iiamed, the largest claimant is Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa. Public Works . Total expenditure Rs 8,446/12/-. Very little new ?/ork was done during the year owing to the necessity for strict economy. The usual repairs to Government buildings and roads were carried out as cheaply as possible. A wall was built along the shore on the north of Muharrak to Busatin in order to reclaim a fine stretch of ground which the sea formerly covered at exceptional high tides. This ground is the only direction in which the town of Muhar rak can extend and in course of time it will become a valua able building site.■n m*f&gt;, EDUCATION. Aftoinistration . The progress of Education during the year has been tranquil in comparison to 1349. There have been no serious disturbances but a certain amount of trouble has been caused by the two councils who resent not having the complete control of the finances and the power to decide the pay and appointments of teachers. This prerogative was formerly a valuable one and much abused as many of the members introduced their own unqualified relations into the schools as masters. The members of the councils are inclined to regard the schools as their private property, though contributing nothing towards their upkeep. Although few of them have any knowledge of Educational methods they resent what they regard as the interference of the government in school affairs. It was stated in last year’s report that the two councils were to be combined into one but this sugges tion, unfortunately, was impossible to carry out as the Shias were unable to overcome their suspicions that the Sunni members of the Hejlis would interfere in their religious matters. Before the beginning of the new term two new councils were chosen in each of which half of the members were elected by the public and half appointed by the govern ment. Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa alKhalifah was made Minister of Education with supreme control in all matters oi educa tion over the two councils and a local Alim, Shaikh Mohd A1 Jishi was appointed, after consultation with the Shia Qiadi, as President of the Shia council. Unfortunately his appointment has not been altogether a success. It was arranged that all schools should be under the-2- the direct supervision of Mr. Adhaii, the Inspector of Education who arranged the programmes of the schools and suorni b Led tnem uo 'fcriQ councils ion ctpiDPOYol* The existence of these councils of education, composed almost entii Ox persons with no loi owl edge or experience is oi no real assistance to the government and is the cause of constant disputes. Their only advantage is that they are able to encourage the public to send their children to school. It would be far more satisfactory if all educational matters were dealt with by Shaikh Abdulla nimself, repxesenting the government, v/ith the assistance o± the Inspector ox Hue at ion who is well Qualified to supervise the public education. he?/ masters . At the end of the previous term all the teaching staff were given notice. Five new masters and three Semale teachers were recruited from Syria. They were selected by the Inspector of Education and Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa alKhalifah, who was, as usual spending the summer in Syria. One of them, the headmaster of the Manama school had been previously recommended by the Beyrout University, the others were provided by the Islamieh College of Beyrout. A certain number of the old teachers ?/ere re-engaged to gether with three of the j^ouths who were educated by the government in Beyrout, and three Shia teachers wrere obtained with much difficulty, from Iraq for the Shia schools. The new staff were taken on regular contracts and agreed to the rules and regulations for the teaching staff Y/hich had been previously prepared and printed by the Government, tne scale of pay was laid dovn at definite rates according bo the qualifications of the teachers. The Majlis dis approved of this as they considered that the local men should be paid more.ih© oujj.ni teacLcrs included two Alims ol* coiisidsrabl© reputation/ and broad minded opinions and one teacher, from Beyrout, who holds a B.A. of that University. The new term proceeded uneventfully though there was some trouble at first at the Muharrak school which grew from the seeds which were sown by the previous headmaster and some of the members of the Majlis; the headmaster of tne Manamah ohia scnool also resented somewhat being* under the supervision of the Inspector and has created some difficulties. Schools and attendance . There are at present eight government schools, six for boys and two for girls, four of the boys f schools are Sunni and two are Shia. The registered numbers of stu dents is 500 ooys and 100 girls, but the actual average oi daily attendances is somewhat lower. The schools are situated in Manama, Muharrak, Hedd, Rafaa and Suk alKhamis. Previously, when the schools were under the direct administration 01 the two councils their monthly expendi ture amounted to Rs 5,600/-, at present the average monthly expenditure is about Rs 3,600/- which includes the salary of the Inspector and a proportion of the pay of the agri culturist who teaches in the schools, the total attendance is not less than before and the standard of education is very much better. This saving has been achieved by a proper control of the finances by the government instead of independent control by the two councils. Education is provided freely by the State and the schools ore open to anybody of any sect or race. The students are supposed to pay for their books but in practice very few pay anything at all and all requests for payment are met ty opposition from the councils. Ajo adard of Educat ion.The schools whose numbers permit the arrangement are divided intwe into two grades, Kindergarten and Elementary, but in the larger scnools there are in some cases as many as six classes, which is far more than is really required. Several of the schools require re-grading but if this ’were done many of the parents would remove their children as they invariably resent any alteration in the class in which their boys are working, unless it is a move forward. The difficulti over schools and education in Bahrain are increased by the fact that parents apparently invariably act in accordance to the wishes of their youthful sons and when spoken to on any sub ject they reply that they do not like to force their children to do anything that does not please the children. Parental authority seems to be practically non-existent. All teaching is done in Arabic, but the English language is taught from the fourth grade, upwards, at the special desire of both the councils. The school term is 9 months and the schools open from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and 2 p*m. to 4-30 p.m. The subjects taught includei— The Opran, .Arabic reading, grammar, syntax, writing, learning powms, composition, arith metic, geometry, bookkeeping, history, geography and hygiene. Games for^a great part of the school programme and lately football matches have been organised between the various schools and local teams. Scouting is also taught. The same text books are now used in all schools and the curriculums of each school is as far as possible the same. During a recent mild epidemic of small pox a large number of the school children were vaccinated, free of charge, at the schools, but this unfortunately caused a protest from the councils. On the whole the gevernm- public appreciate the efforts of the government to encourage education but the slightest-5- innovdbion Q-Ppcsps 'bo ppovoic© q . g6iiGP8.1 ouijcpy so all improvements have to be effected very slowly and carefully. Tutor to the sons of the Ruler. kr. Abdul ^ayum Khan, who was acting as tutor to the younger sons of H.E. Shaikh Earned did not have his contract renewed after completing his first year. His efforts, £ from no fault of his, were not on the whole successful. He was from the first heavily handicapped by not being aole to speak Arabic. ms pupils resented being expected to do regular lessons and only attended very occasionally. The eldest of the four boys who were supposed to be learn ing, Shaikh Mubarak, attended only four or five times a month. H. E. Shaikh Earned though wishing them to learn, did not insist on their working, the result was that the tutor, an educated and well qualified man, was merely wasting his time at considerable expense to the government In the summer, Shaikh Abdulla bin Earned, the second of the four boys, went to Bombay for treatment to his eyes and Mr. Abdul gayum accompanied him. They travelled by land from Karachi to Bombay and visited a number of n native states on the way down. When Shaikh Abdulla reached Bombay Mr. Abdul gayum returned to his home and on completion of the year he relinquished his temporary appointment with this government. Shaikh Abdulla, when he came back to Bahrain asked that an arrangement should be made for someone to teach him and he is now taking lessons from a local man Y/ho used to teach in the Muharrak school. Any attempts to educate the young Shaikhs in Bahrain will undoubtedly be a failure unless strong measures are taken to make them do some work and this is impossible without the co-operation of their father from whom it isis unlikely that pressure will ever be forthcoming. The two elder boys are getting on in age, and both married, and there is small hope of their education • ever improving, the third boy, Daij, can never be made to do anything which he does not wish to do, and it is unlikely that he will learn of his own accord. There remains the youngest of the four, Ahmed, who is about twelve years old. He is still young enough to learn and if he could be sent to school somewhere he might receive a proper education.MANiilAH miCIPiiLITY. Pi nance« Total revenue 1548 Rs 1,06,358/10/7 Expenditure 1349 Balance end of '49 1349 62,287/7/4 68,662/8/- 47,763/14/1. The Municipal revenue, which depends partly on local taxation, shows a considerable falling off apart from the 1348 to Rs 12,000/- in 1349. Trade depression has affected the payment of taxes, some seven hundred householders have failed to pav most of them being divers who made nothing during the last season and received no advances this year. The Municipalities should eventually become self sup porting but this cannot be done without raising the muni cipal taxes on shops and houses, which are at present very low especially in the case of bazaar property. The taxes were assessed according to no regular system and the amounts are very inconsistent. It was proposed that a reassess ment should be made but this proposal, like any others that are likely to affect the purses of the members of the council themselves, was received with no enthusiasm. In matters of finance which touch their pockets the municipal coun cillors show a conspicuous lack of public feeling. The following improvements were carried out during 1349» Cemeteries . A disused cemetery at Kozabia was surrounded by a six feet wall, it is no longer used as houses have been built very near to it. The Sunni and Shia cemeteries on the south of the town have been walled in, leaving enou h space for expansion, inis has much improved the appearance of the southern side of the town, and has provided work for numbers of boats employed in bringing reduction of the Government subsidy from Its 24,000/- inbringing stones from the sea. The funds for this work have been set aside during past years and owing to the un employment this year it was decided to start the work. Lunatic..^s.^ylum . The Municipality took over the charge of a number of indigent lunatics who were en a public nui sance, housed and fed them in a hired building. The Govt, recently granted them a piece of land outside the town on which a permanent building capable of holding 16 persons has been built. The as*ylum is under the supervision of the Medical Officer. Weights and measures . 500 sets of brass weights were made in England for the two Municipalities and are being sold at cost price to local shopkeepers. Sea wall . A piece of ground belonging to the Baladiya at Houra has been reclaimed by building a stone wall Y/hich keeps out the sea. Dangerous buildings . About forty houses v/ere partially demolished in most cases the ruinous upper rooms being removed, as they became public dangers during the abnormally heavy rains. Ice machine . A half share was purchased from E. E. Shaikh Hsmed in the local ice machine, after protracted negociations Y/ith the other half owner, a Mr. Yusuf Khunji of Manchester. The Municipality was granted by the Government a five years monopoly for manufacture of ice for sale in Bahrain. The machine was worked for about 3 months and ice was sold at 7 pies per pound instead of, as previously from 2 to 4 as. per pound. leils. Three wells were bored at places where previous wells had become filled in. Draining laud. A subsidiary drain 500 feet long was built from the Mission square to the main drain which ?/as built * from the municipal garden to the sea. The large accumula-accumulation of water from the rain was carried off by this. n’or several years there has existed on the south of the town several acres of ground covered with pits and depres sions where mud anci. stones were previously quarried. This p±avr place was usually full of water and became a breeding ground ±ox ilies and mosquitoes. It was claimed by Khan jj&amp;lis dur iiotiul xiziz 11 . 0 z 8 .il)i 8s liis prop©riy # •After warnings from the government last year the Mejlis deoided to fill it in, at public expense, with town rubbish, thus manufacturing a most valuable property for the owner. Inis year, owing to excessive rain, the water increased enormously and the place became a public danger. Dr. Dame wrote a letter to the Mejlis pointing out the danger to the Pub-hie ne&amp;x in, ulie Political Agent anci the Bahrain Government o wrote go tne fiejlis on the subject pointing out very forcibly that it was imperative that they should take active meaauies in the matter* ‘The Question was discussed, the Mejlis hired an oil engine and pump and the water is being pumpea out and drained, off to the nearest point on the shore* The question of the ownership was decided and it was found that t of the area claimed by Khan Bahadur Kozaibi was government property. General work * Several streets have been widened in the bazaar, some lanes leading down to the sea road have been filled in, 1000 feet of the sea road have been resurfaced, cement traffic signs have been built at dangerous comers on the roads in the town and some town planning has been carried out on the south of the tom. ihe Municipality is fortunate in possessing a very hard- working and enterprising secretary who is greatly responsi ble for its progress. During the absence of Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa in Syria Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa acted as President of both councils. Owing to hard times very little private building has beenbeen done in Manamah except work on the Kanoo buildings, a lerge blocx oi shops cno. oixices adjacent to the customs on the sea side of the Qovernment Road.muhbrai mum c ipality . This institution being of mere recent growth than the fenama Municipality has less funds available for its setivi- bies. aUS xollouing tvorks have been carried out apart from the usual town cleaning. 25 shops were partially demolished in order to widen roads in une oazaar. me gradual widening of the streets though destroying much that is picturesque, makes the town very much less dangerous in these days of increasing motor traffic, 13 houses were partially demolished in order to widen roads in the residential part of the tom. n iodd. iron une old snore of the town to the new Sea— road has been filled in. a road, suitaole lor mobor traffic, has been made from the fea noad through the tov/n to the plain on the north of Muhar— rak which relieves the narrow bazaar road of much of the pre vious traffic. xhe bay opposite the Customs house, previously an evil smelling backwater, has been filled in and the reclaimed ground is now a very valuable site. Several drains have been made from wells inside the town d down to the sea to carry off surplus water in which mosqui toes were breeding. Four shops and two offices were built tty the Municipality on a piece of Municipal ground. The roofs of the bazaars have been repaired in numerous places. Attention has been paid to house drains and water shoots which were previously in many cases insanitary and dangerous to the public health. the Government gifted a piece of lend on the north of the town as a future municipal garden but owing to necessity e# ^ 0r eco:tlo Eiy a well has not yet been bored on it. j-he town as a whole is remarkably clean especially inin comp8i'ison oo i us condition som© y©8i*s b©!*op© 'tli© days o% the Municipality. Both the local people and visiting nrabs invariably comment upon this fact and compare it to its previous state. Owing to the absence of foreign members on the council its proceedings are less acrimonious than those of the Manama Majlis, which unfortunately^much affected by local politics and by dissentions among the leading ^nrab and foreign mer chants.AGRICULTURE. iPPOIRTUEtl-i- 1 OR Lll iiGrtlCULiUltluT. Towards the middle of the year the government obtained the services of an agriculturist Mr. Said Abdul Hour, from the experimental farm at Rustum, Baghdad, a department of the Iraq. Ministry of Agriculture. Unfortunately owing to lack of funds this year his work has been somewhat restricted. Attempts were made to start an experimental garden. Major Holmes advised the government that water would probably be found by boring on the plain at Aali which is a very suitable area for cultivation and has particularly good soil. Three attempts were made but only a small quantity of water was obtained at 300 feet and it was I strongly impregnated with sulphur. An area of about 60,000 sq. feet is now under cultivation and experiments are being made in growing cotton, vegetables, potatoes etc. The first sowing of cotton failed to germinate but the vegetables, corn V.. etc. grew fairly well in spite of freguent incursions by camels and donkeys belonging to the Khalifah Shaikhs. I 01 iiQRIGULTUIill . Lessons in practical and theoretical agriculture are being given in the schools and once a week the ooys are taken out to Aali where they work themselves in the garden, preparing the ground, putting in seeds and learning how various crops should be planted. The lessons are very popular. —~ x - :; ^-axwOri. The date crop this year was extremely bad owing 1 to irequent swarms of locusts which attacked the trees and | ^ evoure ^ ^ le y°ung shoots. H. E. Shaikh Earned on account of tths issued a proclamation ordering all tenants who had sustained damage to inform the government within a certain time. B &amp; commit Gee of Sunnis and Shias was appointed to visit all the B gardens and investigate the complaints and according to their assessments a proportion was deducted from the leases of all °se who complained. The governments action ?/as much resen-&lt;^(- 2 - 11 2 / resented by landlords who, with some justification, complained that tenants einwAd should take the good years with the bad years; if the crop had been extra heavy they would not have paid higher rent so it was unfair that they, the landlords, should be made to suixer. In a few cases the assessors found that they crops exceeded in value the amount of the leases fce* but on the whole the crops did not produce sufficient to cover the leases. In Bahrain it is usually found that there are more people wishing to lease gardens than there are gardens available, so the leases are auctioned and frequently the Bahama take a gar den for more than it is really worth with the result that they are generally unable to pay the whole rent but in almost all cases the landlord waives some percentage of the amount, or if the tenant leases it again for another two years, his back rent is added to the new lease, which is an unsatisfactory system. The payments are made partly in cash and partly in kind, usually at the time of the date crop and occasionally if they are not paid the tenant disposes of the crop and declares that he has no money. In the case of one garden belonging to H. E. Shaikh Earned the tenant, a very old man owed Rs 16,000/- and eventually paid nothing. He was made bankrupt and his belongings were sold but they only received realised a few hun dred rupees, in another case a tenant of Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa failed to pay an accumulated lease of about Rs 8000/- and the landlord lost the whole amount. It is incidents such as these which have provoked in the past retaliatory attacks by landlords on their tenants. Since the introduction, about eight years ago, of govern- ment leases of over Rs 50/- per annum, and which extend for two years, the system has greatly improved. The prospect of the next date harvest is very good andand unless the crop is severely damaged by locusts there should be double the amount of dates in 1350 than there were in 1349. The present local consumption of dates exceeds the amount that are grown in iSa-hiodn so tne industry is one to be encouraged IHCRiiJhliij Ox 1 oUjiIi/n'l'Ivni. dince it has been possible to obtain water by boring artesian wells, in certain parts of Bahrain, the area under cultivation has increased. Several local mer chants and some members of the Ruling family have acquired ground or used ground which they previously owned and by sinking wells they have been able to increase their date gardens. H. n. Shaikh Earned recently obtained a very large supply of water by boring a well at Seddad, on the coast west of Manamah. A considerable area of ground has been planted by him with date trees and lucfrne but a great deal of water is still running- to wasoe into the sea. .about 4500 young date trees, for planting, were imported into Bahrain during the first 9 months of 1349 and also a selection of other fruit trees which were purchased by private owners. ihe goverrment endeavoured to buy several hundred trees from nustum farm, Baghdad, but unfortunately they no longer supply them and so far none have been obtained. SElilili GARDES' H. E. Shaikh Earned has arranged for one of his finest gardens, which contains over 2000 date trees and which is conveniently situated close to the town of Manamah, to be managed by Mr. Said Abdul Nour. Experiments are being carried out in pruning and manuring on tae lines followed in Iraq, and other countries.. The manuring of date trees is a thing unknown in Bahrain and the local cultivators regard the experiment with much suspicion. They are aggressively conservative and dislike innovations which fl&amp;y entail in the future an increase of work. file system is that of trenches round the base of the trees waicn are filled with rich old manure. It is hoped that sue--4- success will justify the experiment. (TRiTETiAL - Lack of funds this year has somewhat restricted anv activities in the direct of agriculture and also the difficulty in finding a suitable place for an experimental garden has made this project impossible at present. The whole water bearing area along the coast has been examined but unfortunately no suitable place has been found which is not claimed as property of the .al-Khalifah nearer than Zellag about 17 miles from Manamah. It is both expensive and incon venient to make the garden so far away from Manamah and it is hoped that some arrangement may be made closer to the town rossibly by acquiring a lease over port of the well watered ground of Mohomed Yateem, a local merchant,at Barbar.QTMRMTIKB. iotal cost of contruction - Rs 9000/- iifter long and difficult negociations the Baluchi hangers on of the Khalifah fanily who were previously living at '.^alat-^bp-Mehir, the site of the new quarantine camp, were persuaded to move.

Pier. ft ihe work was carried out by the government under the super vision of Mr. Mohomed Khalil. both the site and the buildings are in every way superiorELECTRICITY. Tne serious trade depression has affected the electric scheme severely. Undoubtedly if times had been better a far greater number oi consumers would have been obtained though actually the present number of fans and lights resembles very closely tne numbers estimated when the scheme was originally discussed almost three years ago, me necessity ior economy has also restricted the output to some extent as there has been a complete cessation of those social activities which are usually a feature of the .Arab life in Bahrain and which call for extra expenditure on electricity It was never supposed that the-scheme would be a paying proposition during the first year though in the last years Budget the revenue and expenditure for the electric scheme were assessed at ecLual amounts, the allocation for expendi ture however was considerably greater than the actual amount was expected to be. Tne whole position can be clearly ascertained from the accompanying returns which form part of this report. The position is briefly as follov/s:- Total Revenue 1349 — Rs 20,749/14/- Expenditure — 25,91?/l0/6 Loss, including depreciation - Rs 26,986/9/3. a scheme for assisting intending consumers by means of a payment by instalments system which was arranged by the Manama Municipality though offering very fair terms, produced practi cally no result whatever. The demand for current in the residential part of the town has been fairly satisfactory with the exception of the Sunni Persians who have almost all declined to take any, but the demand in the bazaar has been very disappointing. The demand tor power is small but with the transfer of the Municipal ice plant to the Power House, and possibily/ a supply to the wirelessfireless station tnis demand will soon increase. The running expenses include the salary of an Engineer lent at present to the State by Callenders Cable and Const ruction Co. Ltd., who receives Rs 1000/- per month which is somewhat expensive an item. It is necessary for the State to obtain its own Engineer and the question of his appoint ment is now being considered. If the present pay was offered the recipient would work as a State Engineer, not entirely as an electrical engineer and his pay would be portioned accordingly. In normal times the need for an engineer would justify the expenditure though during the year 1349 very little work of building etc. was done. It is hoped that during the coming year, with the addition al consumption which should be obtained from Muharrak, that the revenue will cover the depreciation, in which case the scheme should begin to pay dividends in the following year. MUIIAEREI EXTENSION . Towards the end of the year it was decided to carry out the Muharrak extension. The people of Muharrak had pre viously complained, with some justification, that though the main scheme was paid for out of public money of which a very large proportion was contributed by Muharrak, being almost equal in size to the town of Manama, yet Muharrak obtained no benefit from the scheme whatever. They considered that they should share the benefits in this scheme which was paid for by the State funds obtained from both towns. Messrs. Callenders Cable and Construction Co. Ltd., sue- mitted a tender for the extension which was linally accepted after some modifications which were suggested by cue C.R.E., Iraq who very kindly advised the Bahrain government on the subject. The final amount was for Rs 53,000/-.This subsidiary scheme includes overhead cable, carried on poles, irom Manama to Muharrak, with a submarine cable section across the channel and a lay out, including street ana bazaar liguts, which will distribute the current through out the main residential area of Muharrak. The actual dis- tribution is liaole to certain alterations which must depend on the demand in the different districts. ihe poles between Manama and Muharrak are to be built into the southern wall of the Manama Muharrak sea road, ht the places where the poles are to be put the wall will u e Duilt uO its lull neight, strengthened by cement, and protectea on me north side by loose coral stone which has been proved go oe a most e^iective method of oreservina 1 the inside wall. The south side of the wall is well sheltered but the northern side received the full force of the sea. So far the demand for electricity in Muharrak has been very small and only a few buildings have been wired; the inbahitants apart from being very badly off this year, are loath to incur the expense of wiring their houses before the power is actually available. The Manamah Baladiya paid 20$ of the whole scheme in Manamah. It has now been agreed that the Muharrak Baladiya shall pay a similar share in the scheme, i.e., 20$ of the . nain Manama scheme and also 20$ of the Muharrak extension and at the same time the Mamma Baladiya will pay 20$ of tue Muharrak extension. In this way the payraent for the extension will be almost covered by the further contribu tions of the two municipalities, but as the funds of the Muharrak Baladiya are very limited, their contributions will be paid to the government in instalments over a period of six years. At the request of H.B.M's Political Agent, the signing-4- signing of the agreement for the Muharrak extension was held up for Messrs. Callenders to make some efforts to reduce the noise caused by the Po?/er House which makes itself a nuisance to the Agency. The contractors referred the whole question to the makers of the machinery in England who are sending out a complete outfit of appa ratus for one engine which, it is thought, will effectively reduce tuie sound. When tue si i,e ol the lower nous© was originally decided H.3.M*s .Political Agent protested against its being so near to the Agency but withdrew his protest on being informed tnat the noise would not inconvenience the inhabitants of the Agency. This information was given by the Bahrain government on the assurance of the Resident Engineer whose opinion was accepted as that of an expert. Any delay in the commencement of the work which may result from postponing the signing of the agreement after the contractors are prepared to start working will cause fin ancial loss to this government, so it is hoped that the question of this complaint will not cause any further delay.

Bahrain has as usual attractad considarable attantion during tha yaa.r in tha local Arab and Persian press currant in this part of the Hear East. Most of the criticisms have been of a hostile nature especially those emanating from Egypt. Tne following are some of the most pointed remarks which indicate the nature of the various nev/spaper articles, *ML-QMRliE' Egyptian Arabic Review (Safar 1349) #/ The Ruler of Bahrain is Shaikh Hamed bin Isa alKhalifah who was appointed by the British to act in the place of his father Shaikh Isa (who is still alive) as he was too N old and not fit to rule the people. Men he (Shaikh Isa) was managing the affairs of this unfortunate country he used to cancel his .orders immediately if they were noi approved of by any of his sons. His sons used to quar rel and fight with each other in order to gain power, this fact led to an anarchic state of affairs; when the British saw this, they removed him, (Shaikh Isa) and appointed his son Shaikh Hamed in his place. ^Shaikh Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah, the Shaikh of Bahrain is 50 years of. age. He is tne Shaikh of Bahrain in name, but not in reality, as the management of the affairs of this country is in the hands of the Adviser and British Consul (Political Agent). He (Shaikh Hamed) receives a monthly allowance of £ 700/-. The inhabitants are very pleased with the justice administered by the said Adviser and want no one to rule them other than the British Shaikh Hamed does not know any language, but he can read and write Arabic. He is in the habit of passing witty remarks and talking much. He is very sincere to the exalted British Government and prays inwardly and openly for their glory and existence. ''The members of al-Khalifah receive large allowances from the State without doing any service to the State whatsoever. It would have been better if these -went were spent on re forms, as the State is in need of many reforms'^ for which it is in need of money. 'There are many big pearl merchants in Bahrain, but it is regreted that they spend nothing of what they have collect ed in the interests of their country. 'The majority of the Arabs in Bahrain are sincere to His Majesty bin Saud the King of Hijaz Najd and dependencies. They (the Arabs) pray always for the glory and progress of his country. They say that Ibn Saud is npt the King of Hijaz and Hajd alone, but that he is the King of all the Arabs. Undoubtedly he is the man who sprang among the Arabs and is looked upon as the most prominent person. mT Both Persian and Arabic papers commented on the questionquestion of the oil concession granted by this State to tne has ter n and Greneral Syndicate, They appeared to supnose uuau it was a very recent natter. The Arab papers contended that it was entirely within the rights of the Bahrain Govern ment, to grant the concession, the Persian papers obviously, regarded it as an infringement of their sovereignty over Bahrain. ?, iil“Ihram ?t Cairo, 31st August 1930. ^One who does not know Bahrain will truly believe that Shaikn iiamed bin Isa, the Shaikh of Bahrain, is the person who grancs concessions and does things which suits him. ire iact is that the Shaikh cannot do anything, not even can he visit his father, without asking the advise of the British. The rule^in Bahrain is in tlie hands of the British. ^The British ^dviser is the person who rules over Bahrain and iv levies taxes. He collects the reve nues and the Customs duties of the country. He orders and he executes, and the Shaikh puts his nonoured signa ture on all -papers which the British Adviser submits to him, without giving any, opinion of his own. In return for this, (the signature] the Shaikh gets from the British (Eastern) Bank in Bahrain, on the first of everu-Arabic month, the hlloY/ance which was fixed by-him forurm by the British Government namely its 10,000/- or EE7Q0/-. The Shaikh of Bahrain is therefore the ruler in name where as all the power is in the hand cf the British Adviser whowas appointed by the Colonial Office, London. The Shaikh visits the Government offices for half an hour every fortnight. From this it will appear that the concession which the British Oil Company obtained in Bahrain was granted by the British and not by the Shaikh, and the Adviser is the person who entered into agreement with the Company. The Shaikh had signed the 'deed of agree ment without knowing what was written and may not have even read the terms of the concession* tm Tf Fata al-Arab 11 1st Septr. 1930. referring to the oil con cession.— 'Ife do not know whether her protest wall have some effects as her previous one or if the League of Nations will lay aside and pay no attention to it, but we know/ that her claim is absolutely baseless for Bahrain ^is a pure Arab State which became under Persian control for a short time and then they (Persian) lost it since a long time. , If we deny the Persians their rights in Bahrain islands, it does not mean that Bahrain should be under British control for the peculation of these islands are pure Arabs as we -m said before and the national theories have occupied their minds perfectly in the last years and it became their sole intention to vet rid of British control and to join one of the two neighbouring Arab kinddoms of Nejd and Iraq. But they should do nothing as their opinions are hardly pressed and they have no note in what England does whether from the economical or political point of views.-3- The news that the Residency was to move from Bushire to Bahrain was announced in the English and hxabic papers of Iraq, and was commented on in whole irab press of Syria, Egypt and Iraq.

'Tith a little encouragement a very large number of the Battar Arabs would undoubtedly leave Qpttar and settle permanently in Bahrain. Bahrain Subjects in Persia .

This proves the steadiness of the inter—coastal traffic, and justifies efforts made to en courage the development of the mot or-car go-launch. Two of such craft now ply regularly between Bahrain and Kuwait, and irregularly, as cargo and passengers offer, betv/een Bahrain and D$bai. The reasons for the decrease in the Customs receipts are (D the world’s trade depression which has hit the pearl trade so seriously(B) last year’s pearling season was bad, and the tajirs had very little fresh stock to offer for sale: (S) the price of rice and wheat and flour from India has, during the past half year shrunk to quite one half of the previous year’s price (4) lack of money has prevented the purchase of so much piece goods as before (5) the export trade in loaf sugar has practically ceased following upon the bankruptcy of the principal firm speculating in this commodity (6) generally, there has been a shrinkage in wholesale values of imports.■Hi - 5 - Reasons Nos. 1 &amp; 2 also account for the decrease in receipts from pearling licenses, since owing to lack of money many craft are unable to go pearling this season. In the year 1348, 5,58,490 packages of cargo were brought to Bahrain by 106 steamers. In the year 1349, 5,01,805 packages of cargo were brought to Bahrain by* 96 steamers.

Two noteworthy improvements have been effected in 1349, (l) the erection of the Customs light, consisting of two 500 watt lamps, one shining out to sea, as required, and the other to illuminate the Pier when night cargo-work is in progress. In this connection the Marine Superintendent of the B.I.o.N.Coy, Ltd., writes ^— .. it is considered that the lighting of Bahrain as it stands has been a decided benefit to shipping n (2) the efection of a hand-worked crane up on the Customs Pier, capable of taking a five-ton lift, which in time will prove of real assistance in the landing of cargo. All the Customs premises are now lit with electric light, which adds to efficiency to working at night. Local craft . There are registered in Bahrain at present, 1279 sailing craft, and 60 motor launches; also 28 motor boats have been built and sold to other ports.

Sir, X have the honour to forward an interesting report by Mr. Belgraye,Financial Adviser t® the Bahrain State during the past . ' ■ ' j Arabic year, i Last year I prophesied a bad financial year,and the prophecy has unfortunately been fulfilled.but next year will 1 fear be worse as almost the majority of the pearl merchants have exhausted their capital in fitting out such boats as they have been able to send to the Banks this year. The advent of the Bahrain Oil Company has given a spurious sense of confidence to the public,but nothing but a revival of the pearl trade can effectually assist Bahrain and the only effect so far has been to raise the price ©f labour. H 2. X regret I do net consider that the present budget will V balance and I estimate that the year will see a further redxjetien '■\ in the State reserves of at least a lakh. The budget is clearly a starvation one,save for the Al Khalifa who wtill receive more than half the total revenue,and it is to be deplored that more money was not spent on productive works during the years of plenty. As I pointed out last year,the Customs receive but a fraction of the money they earn and the installatien of a crane is a belated recegnitien ef their importance te the state. The extension ef the pier to deep water is beyond the resources ef the state at present but should be undertaken at the first opportunity. 3. The passpert revenue X consider far toe high,and the eof passports and subsequent visas bears hardly ®n peer people. it wili. be noticed that the Bahama at Kuhairwerah have contributed largely to this revenue. 4. I concur with the view expressed by the Adviser that the Indian Police could be gradually supplanted by local men.but they will require much more serious training than they are given at present if they are to be of value. The Commandant ©f Police does uisplay groat industry in this respect,and it recently transpired that the Indian Police*who are supposed to be on a 5. The situation in the schools deteriorated after Kr.Belgrave 1 1 departure * or -England and ene ©f the religious teachers began to give trouble. Fortunately the end of the term was at hand and since his servicew are being dispensed with it is t© be heped tha^ next year will be freer from these difficulties. As Ifr.Belgrave • ‘X. ' ' ' , 1 says,the school committees are quite useless and do nothing excepl intrigue with the teachers and the scheels would be better off without them. 6. The figures given under Transhipment oargo for the past year are misleading. Owing to a change in the system of collection much transhipment cargo is new shewn under the main heading of x 1 ^ 4 I been ©old in the past year,but that they have been sold since the iilitary footing, have only fired a course once during their five years in Bahrain.. ”iitearner Cargo 5 * and 'Native Craft”,but the actual volume of \ much transhipment cargo to the mainland remains/the same* The remark that 28 motor boats have been sold does not mean that they have commencement ©f the industry here seme six or seven years ago.3. had already dropped from 24 t© 17 feet and that if the pressure was fur-her reduced it would soon be necessary t© pu©p water* 8* j he shrife&amp;ing incoise has provided Mr•Belgrave with isany difficulties and he deserves every credit for the determination with whicfeihe has tackled them.

As was foresliadowed in my letter Bo. 58 - T, dated 15th November, 1930 has been a bad year for Bahrain, and the year’s working showed a deficit which made, it necessary to draw on savings invested in Bombay to the extent of Rs 1 , 70 9 QQQ/-. 0# ' ^ lQe that the Political Agent (paragraph 2 of his letter) is of opinion that the present budget will not oalance and that the yeax' will see a further reduction in the sia reserves 01 at least one lakh. With regard to these fore- cassia we can only wait and see if they sare fulfilled, 'i'he financial Assistant ^.s of opinion tliat the budget will balance* 4. The finances of the State would at any rate seem to be -u a fairly sound basis. There is a State Reserve Fund of Rs 3,00,000 and the balance of savings invested in Bombay total Rs 1,13,85 6/-/2 . 3. An early return to prosperity,unfortunately can hardlv be^expected. The pearl trade, on which Bahrain depends, has been oaaly hit by the world economic depression, and since it is a luxury trade the market is unlikely to show any renewed life sc2 « m 0 long 4 s the economic conditions of hurope and America remain depressed. Bat.^ith the increase of Khanchia Duty which is esti matsd to bring m an annual revenue of one lakh of rupees,it is hoped that this year's accounts will balance, and that it will not be necessary again to make incursions into the savings of past years.
