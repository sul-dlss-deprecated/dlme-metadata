Kemball writes that an attack by Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh’s subjects at Dammām, with the assistance of the Wahabee [Wahhābī] ruler, has taken place against Bahrain. The attack, which involved 120 boats and 2,000 men, was unsuccessful and resulted in heavy loss. Kemball states that the British Agent in Bahrain [Hajjī Jāsim] was in Dammam and Katiffe [Al-Qaṭīf] shortly before the invasion took place, yet appeared to detect nothing of the attack’s preparations, and has betrayed “much want of sagacity”. Kemball discusses at length the implications of Wahhābī interference in the hostilities between Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah and Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh, and the difficulties of Britain’s position in relation to these hostilities. Kemball writes that he intends to visit Bahrain immediately, specifically to ascertain the future plans of Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah, and whether he intends to go to war against the Wahhābī ruler Ameer Fysul [Emir Fayṣal].The following enclosures are included with Kemball's letter:1. The summary translation of extracts from a letter (folios 54-55v) from Hajee Jassim [Hajjī Jāsim], the British Agent at Bahrain, to Kemball, dated 6 July 1854;2.
