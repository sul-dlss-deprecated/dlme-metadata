This block shows a number of motifs drawn from such scenes. Their asymmetrical arrangement and the size of the object itself raise questions about the original purpose of the block. It may be an artist's model or a fragment of a stela.</p>", "summary": null, "rank": 0, "label_date": "2008-08-01", "date_added": "2008-09-26 00:00:00", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 7127958, "name": "Saqqara, Egypt", "type": "Reportedly from"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "37.1394E_NegA_SL4.jpg", "id": 158077, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/37.1394E_NegA_SL4.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/37.1394E_NegA_SL4.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 76}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 152}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 305}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 610}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1221}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/37.1394E_NegA_SL4.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": "unedited master file", "caption": " <em>Large Tag for Mummy</em>, 664-332 B.C.E.
