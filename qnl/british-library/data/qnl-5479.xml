There w a s considerable difficulty about getting it past the Duzdap Customs, but eventually (partly I am told through a misunderstanding) it reached Meshed. On the road it was slightly damaged and it has been working for nearly 3 years, so certain spares are required as the Wireless operator has been having considerable difficulty in picking up Rugby.

I do not want to spend any portion of my small allotment on batteries which have no chance of passing the frontier. .Final Ly what are my chances, in these times of •national emergency', of being allowed to keep up this Wireless Telegraph set. It is very nice to have our own Wireless Telegraph receiving set out unless it was sent here as a ossiole means of getting orders and instructions through to this distant outpost in times of emergency, I regard it rather as a pleasant extravagance than as a necessity. We suoscribe to the ’’Messager de Teheran' which publj sht d mucq more complete British news than our own operator can hope to take down. Without our Wireless Telegraph set we could get our news 4 or 5 days later than do now *]■MftphMHib 1 do now.

I shall l)e sorry to see it &amp;o, hut it seems to me to he the thing we can most easily spare. Can you let me have any indication as to the mariner in which, if at all, the Government of India’s economy campaign is going to affect us here in Meshed ? If the Wireless Telegraph is to go it is unnecessary either to spend money on spare parts or to risk a clash with the Persian Government in trying to get them through.

My grant under supplies and Services proved last year to he harely sufficient to keep up the wireless plant for which it is alloted. The plant was unfortunately damaged when it arrived here. Mr. Hart of the Indo European Tele graph Department, a very highly skilled operator was able to patch it up sufficiently to v/ork, and considering his * difficulties his successor has been able to carry on satisfactorily. The plant has however been giving trouble batteries are running out, and I anticipate much increased expenditure during the current year. Normally I should have applied for an extra grant but owing to the present 'National emergency' I think that if and when the cost of upkeep begins to exceed the grant the better course would be to close down the tireless Telegraph temporarily until the emergency is over. I am fortified in this position by the difficulty experienced in importing spare parts necessary for its satisfactory working. This difficulty is inherent in the present Persian trade monopoly law and is increased by the Government’s suspicion of all wireless telegraph plants. 7 For instance I have recently, after several months delay,six Marconi 1* / | deiay, 'been givei pr^n|is^i^n |,o import D.E. 5 valves: tpree Marconi D.E. 5.B. valves: 12 one j -\r» ° volt ary cells Giri.d Bias8'“battery proviaed I can satisfy the Customs authorities that they are needea for a Radio Concert set. Unfortunately this Consulate's apparatus cannot he used for Radio Concert. 8. My proposal therefore is to decrease the amount of my budget allotment for Contingencies for the year by Rs.14*000 and if for any reason such as an apprecia~ tion in the Persian exchange I find that my anticipation of savings under this head cannot be fulfilled, or if I find that I am exceeding the allotment under Supplies and Services I propose to shut down the wireless telegraph set. In case this course may be necessary I request that I may be favoured with instructions as to what should be done with Mr. tfajid Ali, the operator. He has been sent to Meshed for 3 years and draws an allowance of Rs.125 per mensem. The expenditure on account of this allowance would presumably be saved if he returned to India, but on the other hand Government would have to incur expenditure of approximately Rs. 400 for his travelling expenses. The longer the return of the operator to India is delayed the less of course will be the saving to Government, but I am hopeful that it may prove unnecessary to take the step here suggested.

The Government of India in March last (Viceroy’s telegram 520-S of 10th March) recommended the provision of a wireless receiving set to enable the Consul to meet Russian propaganda with trustworthy and up-to-date news. The Foreign Office (letter of 19th April: P. 1940) agreed that this was desirable, and the Government of India v/ere so informed in the Secretary of State’s telegram of 4th May on P. 1940. A draft to the Foreign Office, comnxmieating their proposals for action on the lines approved, and asking for an assurance that Imperial revenues will bear half the expenditure involved, is now submitted for approval.

From The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, To His Majesty's Under-Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London. Dated Simla, the 11th July 1928. Wireless receiving set for the Seistan Consulate. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with the telegram from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, No.1206, dated the 4th May 1928, I am directed to say that the Government of India also agree that His Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain should be provided with a wireless receiving set. 2. The initial cost of this set plus freight to India and thence to Sistan will be the same as that for the set proposed for the Meshed Consulate General, viz..« £350 approximately, vide my letter No.476-N., dated the 10th March 1928. The Consulate’s one and a half horse power engine charging 50 volts will be sufficient for charging the batteries, and for the present the Consul’s own motor mechanic will look after the work. It is therefore estimated that the maintenance charges will be about £25 per annum. 3. As regards the operator the Goverrment of India have, after consulting the Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department/Department, Tehran, decided that a suitable man should be posted to Sistan after a few weeks training at Quetta or Karachi to work as an operator in addition to his ordinary telegraph duties and be given a wireless duty allowance of Rs.50/- per mensem. 4. The Government of India are of the opinion that the expenditure in this connection should be divided between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India like other diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia, and I am to request that if this is approved the sanction of His Majesty's Government may be communicated as soon as possible in order that arrangements may be made for the supply of the set and the training of the operator. I have, etc., (SD.) DENYS BRAY. Foreign Secretary to the Governnent of Indir OPY OF 1940/28. Political Department. The Foreign Office appear to concur generally in the views expressed in our letter of the 7th April as regards the continued political importance of Seistan and the necessity of continued effort by His Majesty*s Government and the Government of India to counter Russian extension of influence there. The views of the Government of India seems to have been based very largely, if not wholly, on the somewhat defeatist despatch of Mr. Skrine, British Consul in P.1734/28. Seistan, which is discussed in the departmental minutes endorsing the supply of a wireless receiving set to our Consul, it may serve to make the Government of India attach greater importance to the question generally and carefully consider what more can be done.

Your telegram dated 10th March No.520-S Seistan. I am glad to hear that activities of Russian Consulate now appear less vigorous than at first reported. But this in my opinion does not justify any diminution in our efforts but affords opportunity rather to recapture any lost ground. Foreign Office concur in my view that Seistan is not and is not likely to become politically a backwater and that His Majesty^ G-overrment and your Government should pursue an active policy there with a view to prevent Russian economic and political penetration and retain predominance for British influence. I await your further views regarding means to carry out this object. Meantime Foreign Office agree that Consul should be provided with wireless receiving set in order to enable him to counter Russian propaganda with up-to-date news from trustworthy sources.COPY o F &amp; DFT/^^vSRA/liVVo (102-groups.) 1056. COPY OF I £ L E G HJLM. From Viceroys Foreign and Political (COPXKS - Departeients to Secretary of CIRCpUTED) State for India,, Dated Ne* Delhi, l©th March, 19S8. Received 12.15 p.m., 10th March, 1928, X X £20-SL, Our telegram 305-So Skrine, vho has teen discussing question with Biscoe and was in Delhi recently, reports that activities of Russian Consulate slackened off considerably after first month, that funds at its disposal do not appear to be so large as at first advertised, end that there is no evidence as yet of any anti-British propaganda or other objectionable activities. Owing to advent of motor car and deflection of trade to the direct Duzd&amp;p-Birjand route Selstan is now politically and conwerclally a backwater, end it seems possible that the Soviet realising this have decided it is not worth much expenditure and have their eye more on establishing footing in western Afghanistan than on undermining us in South-east Persia. We are considering following measures and will inform you of the results in due course. Whether to reduce or Increase our efforts in future must of course depend on the extent of activity to be counteracted at any given moment. (1) Encouragement- of trade by a reduction in existing double freight rates on the Nushkl-Duzdap Railway and by other minor concessions. Attention of the Minister has already been drawn by the Consul to the existing Customs difficultiesdifficulties at Duzdap, and any amelioration of these will, of course, te of value. (2) increase in the funds at the disposal of the Consul at Seietan for intelligence purposes. (3) Provision of a wireless receiving set to enable the Consul to meet Russian propaganda with trustworthy and up to date news. Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Tehran, 27 .t.COPY OF Telegram P.No.2606-S. Dated the 20th December 1927. From Foreign, Delhi. To Consul, Sistan. (Repeated Minister, Tehran h T o.65-T.) Please see your telegram No. 307 and connected correspondence. His Majesty's Government wish to know whether anything can be done to counter Russian activity in Sistan. Please let us know as soon as possible whether you have any suggestions to make.Telegram P. No. 363 dated and received 27th December 1927. From Consul, Sistan. To Foreign, Delhi. (Repeated to Tehran No.56) Reference is invited to your telegram No. 2606 dated the 21st Instant. To encourage trade by further subsidy in shape of reduced Railway freights would be most effective method. Double outward rates between Ahmedwal and Duzdap are particularly burdensome and practically neutralise existing rebate. Cheap return passenger fares between certain Indian stations and Duzdap would also help trade. As regards activities of this Consulate (1). Our secret service organisation has already been extended considerably but present grant of Rs.3000/- is inadequate. Prior to 1910 secret service grant was Rs.2400/- and Toshakhana Rs.2500/- and I suggest a secret service grant of Rs.6000/- inclusive by which I will be able to counteract Russian Consulate propaganda in Sistan and keep in touch with their intrigues (with?) various Afghans from across the border, instances of which have already come to my notice. (2) Lack of mobility owing to ruinous cost of either keeping own car or hiring for long journeys over bad roads between Sistan, Duzdap and Birjand is anotner serious handicap. Russians have two Office care and I suggest purchase and upkeep by this Office, one touring motor car and one light lorry. If approved proposals for initial expenditure and upkeep will be submitted. (3)/(3) If Russians are allowed to keep their wireless receiving set we should have one too, as late arrival of news makes it difficult for us to refute Russians spreading rumours. At present owing partly to lack of funds and partly to congestion on Indo-European Telegraph Department lines we do not get even Reuter’s summary. (4) Abolition of regular escorts here and at Duzdap is somewhat unfortunate at this juncture. Venture to guess that agitation at Tehran in this connection may be traced to Russians who would like to see us deprived of privileges that they do not enjoy. Suggest reconsideration of question and treatment of Sistan as a special case in view ofius strategic position and remoteness from Tehran. You are being addressed separately regarding Duzdap Infantry Guard referred to in your telegram No.2396-S of 30th ultimo. (5) Finally I suggest the present Indo-European Telegraph Department sigialler who is an Armenian should be replaced by an Englishman. The present signaller Alexandrovsk, a man of unreliable character and always in debt, is on intimate terms with the Russian Consulate Staff which is chiefly composed of Armenians. The Superintendent, Indo-European Telegraph Department Frontier Sub-Division, agrees.Telegram P. No # 25. Dated (and received) 14th January 1928. From Consul, Sistan. To Foreign, New Delhi. Razzaqzadeh Yazdi is Soviet Consult Agent at Karachi. His telegraphic address is Razzaqoff.British Consulate, D.0,28. Sistan, 16th January, 1928. Exurese Letter . From Consul, Sistan. To Foreign, Delhi. My telegram 363. Chief Russian aims seem to be (1) to spoil our trade via Duzdap and capture of market (2) to embroil us with Persia and Afghanistan by means of intrigues with tribes on both sides of the border in Sistan and the Sarhad (3) to gp-in access to India for their agents via Dusdap. (1) Besides freight and other concessions already advocated I would urge early measures to deal with Duzdap Customs (See my telegram 347 and 355 and diary for December, paragraphs 120-122). Apart from attitude of Ministry of Finance, behaviour of Customs officials at Duzdap is most objectionable. ConsiiL-General, Meshed, has reason to believe that Inspector Ataullah Khan is employed by Russians to annoy merchants and damage trade in every way. I have no definite information yet but I think this is a very probable explanation of behaviour reported. If Ataullah Khan and Provincial Director Moreau who is complete nonentity were replaced by good men I would withdraw my suggestion that railway service be discontinued west of Kuh-i-Tftan station. (2) I have got hold of Soviet Consulate’s chief agent and adviser, a well-known wool-broker, from whom I have/(2)/ have the following (a) Russians spend equivalent of Hs # 1800 on Secret Service last month, I h ve the names and addresses of 11 agents with details of amounts paid to them. (b) Soviet Consul has already received visits from several transborder Afghans and has arranged with one of them Ali Khan Bamdin of Chakao, to tour in Chakansur and Farah districts later on. (c) He is cooperating in Kerman Consulate's intrigues in Persian Baluchistan and is trying to get into touch with Dost Mohanmed through Baluchis of southern Sistan, whose leaders are however already in our pay and are blocking the scheme. (3) No agents have yet started but several are standing by. Soviet Consul is receiving letters from one Razzaqzadeh Yezdi of Karachi whose correspondence should be censored. Assuming that Russian advance is to be opposed and that no understanding on lines of 1907 Convention is conceivable, my idea, apart from all-important encouragement of trade, is (I) to expand our intelligence system rather than to indulge in counter-propaganda (II) to counter Russian Consulate's activities by increasing our own generally. Taking proposals contained in my telegram 363 seriatim: - (1) Total of Rs.500 per mensem would be spent roughly as follows: Rs.300 on pay and rewards to agents; Rs.100 on presents and services to important Persians e.g. helping Governor of Sistan to get films from India rather than through Soviet Consul for his new cinema (Diary paragraph 116); Rs.100 reserve.(2) This post involves travelling several thousand miles by road annually. It cannot be compared with ileshed or Kerman where most of work is concentrated in one large town. Activities of Russians render mobility on part of our representatives even more important than before. Owing to trying climate, high cost of supplies and absence of metalled roads, private motoring costs from Re.l/- to 1/6 per mile per car including depreciation. Hiring rates are corrrespondingly high. Travelling allowance being annas 10/8 per mile therefore, proper touring involves officers in heavy loss. (3) Could legation be consulted regarding possibility of wireless receiving sets for this and any other Consulate that wants one? If Russian Consulates have them, expense which would be relatively small would be more than justified on grounds of importance (1) of keeping our Consulates in touch with Government and news agencies (2) of insisting on euqal treatment with Russians. (4) I will not press for retention of my cavalry escort if its abolition will help Legation. Question of Duzdap Infantry guard should however be treated separately I addressing you shortly regarding latter. (5) Inspector Frontier Sub-Division, Indo-European Telegraph Department is corresponding with Tehran office regarding transfer of Armenian signaller.

The proposal made by Colonel Biscoe that he should be allowed a wireless set is not unreasonable, though the cost seems very high. Both the Minister and the Foreign Office support it. The one difficulty likely to arise is that mentioned in paragraph 4 of Sir Robert Clive's Despatch of 5th November, viz. that the Persian Government, who are becoming rather restive about the maintenance of wireless sets within their territories, might take exception to the installation of a set at Meshed. The Minister however does not seem to think that they are likely to refuse to allow the possession of sets which may receive messages but are uma. ole to tranauit them, and we need not perhaps therefore further consider this difficulty.at the moment. I would suggest therefore that the proposal might be put to the Government of India who might also be asked to consider whether, if they are in favour of granting it, more economical arrangements could not be made than the Consul-General suggests.

Neither Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe nor I feel that the disadvantages which he foresees as likely to arise are sufficient to outweigh# the considerable economy which the cessation of tha Government of India's responsibility for the line will effect, and I see no other objection to this proposal. 3. It would, I hope, be possible to induce the Persian Telegraph Authorities to take proper measures to minimise errors in the transmission of telegrams. 4. I think it undesirable that His Majesty's Consul General should be dependent on the receipt of newspapers by post for his general news. I trust, therefore, that it will be possible to consider favourably Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe's suggestion that he should be provided with a Wireless receiving set. As you are aware from my despatch No.543 of the 5th November 1927, the /Persian The Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P., FOKhIGN CP KICK.Persian Government are taking measures regarding the use of wireless sets, but I cannot believe that they will refuse to allow the possession of sets that can only receive messages and are unable to transmit them. X have the honour to be with the highest respect* Sir* Your most obedient humble Servant* (Signed) R.H Clive\ If the line is handed over to the Persian, the Consul General and Military Attache will be (i) deprived of Reuters telegrams, (ii) dependent entirely on lines maintained by the Persians for coiamunication with Tehran t±nd India, since the Itoshed-Duzdap line is also run by the Persians. As regards (i) newspapers from India aT from England take 16 to 18 days in summer, and frequently over three weeks in winter to reach Meshed. To be invariably about three weeks behind the times is frequently a serious drawback. As regards (ii), during the summer a certain number of telegrams were sent from Tehran through the Persian office instead of through the I.E.T.D., They were almost invariably so mutilated that great difficulty was experienced in decoding them, and repetitions had to be asked for, and ultimately representations were made to His Majesty’s Legation when arrangements were made that, in, future, all telegrams should be sent by the I.K.T.D., and , ^ no further difficulty was experienced. In view of the general condition of administrative inefficiency which prevails in eastern Persia, it is not improbable that the working of the line would be very unsatisfactory. The working of the Kermanshah-Hamadan line is aaid to be reasonably satisfactory, but I doubt if this is a safe criterion. The former line is on iron poles; the latter on wooden poles of mried shapes and sizes, while everything in /eastern©astern Persia is run on much less efficient and up-to-date lines than in western Persia. In short, handing over the line to the Persians will result in the politioAl and military officers of the Government of India being wry much more isolated than they are at present and a good deal of delay in communicating with them may be looked for. Moreover, during the disturbances which occurred in Khorasan in 1926, the Consul General at Meshed was able to talk over the wires direct with His Majesty's Chargi d'Affaires, and should any crisis arise, this is a valuable method of settling matters in a few minutes. In the future this will, of course, be impossible. It is, however, for the Government of India to decide whether they consider, from a political and military point of view, the advantages of the present arrangement worth the expenditure involved. If they consider that it is not,then perhaps, in view of the fact that they would be saving about £,2,300 per annum, the Government of India would be willing to give the Consul General a wireless receiving set. The Director of the I.&amp;.T.D., states that the initial cost would be about £400 to £500, the cost of maintenance about £100 per annum, while a suitable clerk could be obtained on about Rs.300 to Ks.400 per mensem. This would enable the officers at Joshed to receive the British official wireless and German wirelessSir, British Legation, Z JAN 1928 Tehran, v [.■■■ m 14th Deoamber, 1527. vith reference to your telegram ffo* 165 of the let instant, authorising me to make a communication to the Persian Government on the subject of the Tehran-Meshed Telegraph Line, I have the honour 1 to transmit herewith copy of the Kote which I yesterday addressed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs* 2* The Hote has been sent in full agreement with the local Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department.
