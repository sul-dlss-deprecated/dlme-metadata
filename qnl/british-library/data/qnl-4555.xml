MOORE CORPORATION, ROCHESTER, After a customer has purchased one of our Loose Leaf Binders he becomes so im- pressed with the many advantages of Moore’s Modern Methods that he very soon V wants another Binder for some other purpose; in fact, the more records he keeps in | our books, the more he wants to keep in them, the result being that eventually he finds JT j desirable to have a suitable cabinet for holding the record books. To meet this constantly growing demand, we have put in stock a complete line of special cabinets, made in various sizes for holding any number of books, from two to twelve, each cabinet containing a separate dust-proof com- partment for each book. The compartments are of a proper size to hold our standard Binders, measuring 5 inches wide by 8^4 inches long by 3 inches thick. The twelve and eighteen volume cabinets, being made in sectional form, can be '^Jir stacked together, thus making a complete cabinet of any desired size. They fit together without any unsightly metal connections and are made of quarter-sawed White Oak, the Each cabinet is complete in itself, t0p ’ L b L aC , k an 1 d e ? d , s being bai ? d and does not require an extra -S * rubbed and P ol, * bed m . all .8 bt ton or base to oive it a r I finished appearance.
