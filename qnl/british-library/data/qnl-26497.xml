How they came by their English name is not known 5 the Arabs call them the Islands of Bin Ghalfan after an Arab family who seized them in 1836. She Islands consist of little but bare granite and were only valuable in the middle of the last century because of their guano deposits. These were exhausted by I860, and since then the islands have been very rarely visited by Europeans. It is beleived that earlier in this century De Montfried made use of them as a convenient depot for the hashish in which he used to traffic between the Red Sea and India, but there is nothing oq record to show when the last official visit was paid to them. Nominally they are a part of the Aden Crown Colony, but for administrative purposes they are under the control of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The islands are five in number* Four of them form a line running due east and west and covering some fifty miles, The fifth Gharzaut, lies somewhat to the north of this line, and consists only of a pinnacle of red granite and a gleaming white shelf which is presumably covered with guano. We approached the islands from the west and came first to Haskiyah, which is about a mile square and composed of light red granite faintly whitened with guano. It was here and at Jibliyah, the most easterly of the islands which has a very similar appearance, that the guano deposits were worked in the last century. These deposits were presumably the accumulation of thousands of years, and from the sea they do not appear to have been built up again to any appreciable extent since the work was abandoned. We saw no birds whatever on Haskiyah although it is reported to be the home of thousands of gannets. Possibly it was-I \ EXT was not the right time of the year for them* i i' W. J The next island Suda is about twelve miles f#ojft h ; Haskiyah and is the second largest in the group* We had been »told that a woman and her four sons were living on it, but although we cruised all round it we saw no sign of hjiman habitation. We were later able to confirm from the people of Hallaniyah that it is uninhabited. It is three miles long and two broad and consists of one granite sugar-loaf hill which rises to a height of 1380 feet. There are some bushes close to the shore on the south siM of the island and there is said to be a well of brackish water. The next island Hallaniyah iix miles away is the largest in the group, being more than seven miles long and more than three miles broad. It is composed of a ‘tangled mass of granite hills with a dark serrated ridge rising to 1600 feet near the eastern end and a magnificent red bluff at the north-western corner. This bluff forms one end of a bay which affords a sheltered anchorage during the south-west monsoon. There is a fair amount of rather brakkish water on the island, with a few bushes here and there close to the shore. In 1901 the island was reported, I think wrongly, to he uninhabited. We approached theiisland at its north-east corner and some figures quickly appeared on a small beach. We at once went ashore and were greeted, by two men and four boys. They were of poor physique and the boys were miserably thin. All wore their hair short and not long as is the custom ub is the uirstom amongst the Arabs on the mainland in these parts. They talked Arabic but said that their real language is Shihri which they explained as being the same as talked by the people of Murbat. They claimed affinity with the same people but were unable to say to what tribe they belonged. Murbat is a small port on the Dhofar coast with a mixed population, nearly 100 miles distant from Hallaniyah. They said there were about seventy people on the island and that they had been there since time immemorial; the oldest man of the party who was, about 60 daid he had been born on the island and had always lived there. Practically their sole occupation is fishing. Theyit TS / \ 1 ^ 4 'U their fish p-fca-ced-at- r They own no boats of any kind but catch most of rectangular basket-traps which I understand are . considerable depths and retrieved by diving. Their main catch is the flsafi 1 a small black fish of which as many as a hundred may be caught in one trap at a time. These they dry and sell to the people of Murbat whose boats visit the island from time to time bringing millet, cloth and the few other articles which are necessary for their extremely primitive mode of life. Boats from Masirah island also come at certain seasons of the year for the shark-fishing, but otherwise they appear to have few visitors. The islanders own about fifty goats which we did not see but which we were told are in poor condition as there has been no rain for three years. We were however offered some milk. After we had talked for some time we were taken to the village which was situated a few hundred yards away across a small ridge. It is a hollow amongst low ridges and is very difficult to see until you are almost inside it. It eonsists of about ten huts built of loose stones and roofed with all sorts of rubbish including fish-bones, seaweed and odd bits of tin. There was onw house much superior to the rest with a mud roof which we were told belonged to a merchant of Sur near Muscat who had gone off to Zanzibar with a cargo of dried fish, leaving his family on the island to await his return before the monsoon. The whole village appeared completely deserted, and we were told that the inhabitants had all gone fishing or were living in booths elsewhere on the island, but I suspect that they had all fled with their movegble property to the hills being doubtful whether our intentions were strictly honourable. The party who met us however showed no signs of fear. They posed for a photograph without a minute's hesitation, just as if they had done so many times before and immediately on our arrival at the villageone of the men darted off and produced some specimens of ore for our inspection. We spent about an our on the island and before we left handed over to the party who had assisted us some bread and cigarettes and a few Maria Theresa dollars which are the local currency. They begged us for sugar but we had unfortunatelyunfortunately brought none with us* The fauna of the island are described as whip-snakes, scorpions and centipedes. We saw none of them except one scorpion but we made enquiries about the wild-goats. We were told that there are no ibex (wa^l) on the island but that •dhabi* are found. This is the word used in other places for the gazelle which is an animal of the plains and hardly likely to be found on an island consisting entirely of crags and precipices. It is possible therefore that there may be some kind of short-horned wild-goat or wild-sheep on the island. The last island Jibliyah is sexteen miles east of Hallaniyah. We did not pass very close to it, but from the distance it looks very much like Haskiyah, being about the1006/47 8th Uay 9 1947 Dear Sir, &gt; X asi desired to acknowlecige with your letter of 2 nd Mcy about the p^iaaens of iron ore wiiioti we sent you# The help you have given in this Matter is ration appreciated.

Major Stewart Political Agent Muscat was also on board. k 2. A full geographical description of the islands is given in Volume II of Lorime^s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf at pages 1043-1046. We passed close by Haskiyah and Jibliyah islands which are still white with guano, cruised all round Suda and landed on Hallaniyah. 3. We examined Suda closely owing to a report that a woman and her four sons were living on the island, but saw no traces of human habitation and were later able to confirm from the people on Hallaniyah that Suda is uninhabited. When we approached Hallaniyah a few men and boys appeared on a beach at the western end of the island and I went ashore withjthe Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf and the Political Agent. We were greeted by two men and four or five boys. They were all poor specimens physically and the boys were miserably thin. They informed us that there are about 70 persons living on the island. They have been settled on the island for a very long time and the oldest man in the party who was about 60 said he was born on it. They do not know to what tribe they belong but say their language is Shihri, and that it is the same as is spoken at Murbat. They also speak Arabic. They live by fishing, but own no boats and catch their fish mostly in basket-traps. The chief fish they catch is the ^afi* which they dry. Boats from Murbat come from time to time to buy their fish and give them millet and other necessaries of life in exchange. Fishing-boats also come from Masirah to catch shark. They own about 60 goats but there has been no rain on the island for three years and the grazing is very poor. We were taken to their village which is a small collection of stone huts inside some low hills at the western end of the island. Drinking water is said to be plentiful and we saw one well near the beach. No inhabitants appeared except the party who first met us and we were told they were all fishing. The women had probably been hidden in the hills. The best house in the village was said to belong to one Nasir of Sur who had gone off with a cargo of\ 2 of fish to Zanzibar leaving his family otnj the islandu There is no recognised Shaikh on the isljand and the oldest inhabitant is regarded as its head.—The-people we talked to seemed surprisingly sophisticated and one of the first things they did when we came to the village was to produce some specimens of ore. They stated that the last European to visit the island w$s a Political Agent from Muscat in the time of Sultan Taimur who abdicated in 1932. It is believed that Simon de Montfried made use of the island in the course of his drug-trafficking activities. We handed over some bread and cigarettes to the party which met us but were unable to satisfy their main requirement which 4.

In the draft of the Aden article in the- new Act which was first considered here and in the draft to which the C.O. agreed (flags A on the file), the province of Aden was defined as including the Kuria Muria Islands. The whole definition, however, was omitted from the Bill as introduced (at the suggestion, I understand, of Parliamentary Counsel, though there is nothing on record as to his reasons for the omission). The Islands were ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Puscat in 1854 and are British territory. They have been regarded as part of Aden, though administrative control was transferred to the Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1931.

There is no doubt that the Islands are British territory, and have always been regarded as part of Aden, (see, for instance, Bray’s answer No.149 in the Legislative Assembly on 5th September 1929). As an administrative step, the islands were transferred to the charge of the Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1931 but this did not affect their status (see the Government of India’s letter of 12th August 1931, No.F.163-N/31 and connected correspondence). 2. It is clearly desirable that the Islands should cease, with Aden, to be part of British India, and this presumably will be automatically Effected by the transfer of the Chief Commissioner’s Province of Aden as existing on the Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, K.C.I.E., C.3.I., M.V.O., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department, Simla. appointed/appointed day under Article 288 of the Government of India Act, 1935, inasmuch as their present legal status is that of one of the dependencies included in the province of Aden and despite the administrative decision of 1931. Could you let me know whether the Government of India agree that this will he the legal position? In order to remove any possible doubt that the islands are part of the Province of Aden fb r the purposes of Article 288, we included in our first drafts of that Article, a definition of the province of Aden: the phrase was 'the settlement of Aden and its dependencies inclusive of the villages of Sheikh Cthman, Imad, and Hiswa, the Island of Perim, Little Aden, and the Kuria Muria Islands”; but the definition was omitted from the final draft because the parliamentary draftsman thought it unnecessary* 3. In order to make the position clear, it might be desirable that the Islands should by administrative act be transferred back to the charge of the Chief Commissioner, Aden, before the 'appointed day”. If you agree, we will accordingly write officially to the Government of India asking that this should be done. it does not seem to matter/■ — l 3. matter greatly whether actual control, so far as any is necessary, is exercised from Aden or the Gulf, hut if it is felt that there are reasons of convenience in favour of the latter, the matter could no doubt be subsequently so arranged in practice, if the Colonial Office agreed, 4. Do you agree with the suggestion in paragraph 3? I am sending a copy of this letter to Fowle. Youi*8 alno©F©ft&amp; : Sd.) J. O, WALTOKh^0^ 78120/36.

Dear Clauson, I understand that James had a word with you on the telephone regarding the position of the Kuria Muria Islands in relation to the impending separation of Aden from British India. These islands became British territory in 1854 by virtue of their cession to the British Crown by the Sultan of Muscat, but it is not clear that they have ever been administered or formally annexed to British India. For many years they were nominally in the administrative area of the Resident at Aden, but in 1931 administrative control was transferred to the Resident in the Persian Gulf. In this connection please see the enclosures to our letter No. 89277/31 of the 20th May, 1931, and the subsequent correspondence ending with your letter No. P.Z.7139/31 of the 24th November, 1931. When the future status of the islands came to be considered in connection with the transfer, it M. J. CLAUSON, ESQ. wasamong was at first proposed that they: should he included the other named, dependencies of Aden in the definition of Aden in the Government of India Bill (see Walton's letter to Cowell No. P.Z. 7155/34 of the 22nd November, 1934), but the islands were not, in fact, specifically mentioned in Section 288 of the Act. The question was, therefore, left unsettled, but I believe Laithwaite had in mind that the position could be dealt with by making the islands part of the Province of Aden before the 'appointed day'. This would ensure that when the Order-in-Council contemplated by Section 288 of the Act came into force the islands would automatically cease to be part of British India, and become part of the Colony of • Aden. We should he glad to know what decision was ultimately reached regarding the method of dealing with these islands and whether any action which may be required has yet been put in train. Yours sincerely.M, &gt; ■ $ P.Z.7489/34. Extract from Colonial Office letter No.37960/34 dated 7th December 1934, to J.C.Walton, Esq.

Stewart, 'X?, Please see the note below submitting a d*o* letter to the G.O. about the Kuria Murias. To give efiect to the conclusion of this morning’s discussion,Clause 255(5) might perhaps be as follows: ”255(5). In this section the expression Aden means the 4 settlement of Aden and its dependencies, inclusive of the villages ol Shaikh Othman, Imad and Hiswa, the island of Perim, Little Aden and the Kuria Muria Islands, whereof the government was before this Act came into operation under the superintendence, direction and control of the G.G. of India in Council'’. This definition is partly based on the definition of the Province of Aden in Schadile A of Regulation II of 1932, which follows Sect.2 of Regulation II of 1891 (copies attached), but. the phrase 'whereof the government is under the super in tenderue direction and control of the G.G. of India in Council” is on the analogy of Section 33(3) of the G.of I. Act. Would it be permissible to consult the C.O. confidentially and demi-officially on Clause 255 as a whole? The matter, of j course, affects them closely, and it might perhaps be desirable to make sure that the proposed method of dealing with Aden - viz: by applying the British Settlements Act, 1887* is adequate and suitable from their point of view. On a further small point, it might also be as well to let them know of the proposed reference to the possibility of % contribution from the revenues of Aden towards the expenses of the Bombay High Court (even though this is only a power to be conferred on H.M. in Council). J.C.W. 19.11.34.I have kept a copy, for consultation m th Parliamentary Council, of Mr. Walton 1 s proposed definition clause. I see no objection to the C.O. seeing the draft clause for comment, provided a typed copy of this clause only is sent, saying -we are considering a claim on these lines for inclusion in any Bill -which emerges from the Report, but I would wait till Thursday (when the report is published) to send it.

Department. &gt;s 4H }' 'V lc. s, $ The Karia Maria Islands are situated about Long. 56° E., Lat. 17° 30’ N. off the southern coast of Arabia, which here forms part of the dominions of Muscat. They are five in number. In 1926 the Political Agent, Muscat, reported that only one island was inhabited (by a patriarchal family of 35 persons). The islands were ceded in 1854 by Muscat to the British Crown. They were valuable only for their guano deposits (which were reported m 1926 to be exhausted). A licence was granted in 1856 to certain British subjects for five years to collect guano and other substances; this project failed, as the licensees’ employees were expelled by the Arabs. A British telegraph station was established m 1859, but removed in 1860 in consequence of failure of the cable. In 1931 some correspondence took place with Mesas. J.A. Hunter and J. Konst of Harbin, who applied for permission to undertake guano farming. Reports on the applicants were unfavourable, and their application was refused. In connection with this correspondence Col. Reilly, in his letter to the Govt, of Bombay of 24th April, 1931, suggested that, though these islands were regarded as a dependency of the Aden Settlement, questions affecting them could more conveniently be dealt with by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, since the mainland adjacent to them was within his jurisdiction. |Col. Fowle agreed, pointing out that for air purposes the islands were already included within the area of responsibility of the A.O.C., Iraq, as it extended along Ithe mainland to Ras Shajir, a point westward of them, which was/ 2956 6000 7/31was also the limit of the Political Resident’s jurisdiction. With the concurrence of the C.O. orders were accordingly given that control of the Kuria Muria Islands should be transferred from the Readent at Aden to the P.R. in the Persian Gulf. It would be desirable that this portion of British territory should be separated from India along with the Settlement of Aden, especially in view of the possibility that the islands may acquire strategic importance as a result of the establishment of R.A.F. seaplane bases on the southern coast of Arabia. ^ Aw/ A?, ^Draft Paper. H.R. Cowell, Esq., C.M.G., C.O. Department. ^ 2 NOV 1954 Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with G.O. letter of 16th October, 1931, No. 89277/31, in which it was agreed that the control of the Kuria Maria Islands should be transferred from the Resident at Aden to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It i s thought here that we ought to provide in the forthcoming G. of I. Bill for the separation of these islands (which are British territory) along with Aden from India. Apart from the fact that they do not, geographically or naturally, form part of India, there is the possibility that they might at some future time acquire some degree of strategic importance. In this connection, please see Reilly’s letter of 24th April, 1931, to the Govt, of Bombay (enclosed with his despatch No. 96 to the G.O.), in which he pointed out that the establishment of R.A.F. seaplane bases between Aden and the Persian Gulf is leading to increased contact with the neighbourhood of these islands. Separation from India could be effected quite easily by including them among other named dependencies of Aden - ; Shaikh Othman, Imad and Hiswa, Little 1 Aden and Perim - in the definition of 2800 5000 5.34 Aden/Aden in the Bill. I am not sure whether this would make it necessary to go through the formality of reversing the administrative orders passed in 1931 which transferred the control of the islands from the Resident at Aden to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. But if so, it would still seem possible, as a matter of administrative convenience, to arrange subsequently that any control should be exercised by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (acting in this behalf as, agent of the Home Govt.), if such arrangement should at any future time be thought convenient in practice. Could you kindly let me know your views as early as possible? If the C.O. see no objection, we could confirm by official letters, that the Kuria Muria * Islands are to be regarded as one of the dependencies of the Aden Settlement, ,« Mo.

Sir, beg to acknowledge receipt of your valued letter of the 4th July 193l( No.C/36i), in which you state that the Political Agent of Muscat reported the guano deposits of the Kuria Muria Islands to be exhausted in 1926. This report causes us to change our original plan, which contemplated exploitation of such guano deposits as might be found to exist on the islands, ye now propose to apply to the islands a method which has been styled 'guano farming' and has been tried with great success on the exhausted guano islands of Peru and of South Africa. It briefly consists in accelerating the accumulation of fresh deposits of guano by artificially increasing the number of guano-producing birds, this to be achieved mainly by keeping down the predatory birds which annually destroy great quantities of the eggs and chicks of the guano birds. The natural conditions enabling such a scheme to be carried out, viz. an abundance of small fish to serve as food for increased numbers of guano birds, and an arid climate to keep the newly deposited guano from deteriorating, are no doubt present at the Kuria Muria islands. In Peru the guano harvest occurs every thirty months. Obviously, such a scheme can only repay its initiators in the course of a considerable time. V/e therefore beg to grant us a long time concession, and in this connection beg to call attention to the fact that a great many islands of the Pacific are leased to 'Levers Pacific Plantation Go,' for 99 years, beginning from 1902. The principal object of thatis cocoa nut that Company, to the beet of our knowledge, is cocoa nut growing, which as regards the time within ^hich a returns are to be expected msy probably be considered a s of w^jdchxx® approximately the same nature as H guano-fa raii ng'.

Subject:- Kuria Mu ria Islands. Sir, I have the honour to forward an extract from a letter dated the 14th January 1931 from Messrs. Hunter &amp; Company of Harbin applying for a concession to explore deposits of guano or phospbace on the Kuria Muria I slands. 2. I have replied to Messrs. Hunter and Company that their application is being referred to the Government of India; I have at the same time informed them that the guano on the Islands is said to be exhausted. 3. I take this opportunity to draw attention to the anomalous position of the Kuria Muria Islands. By virtue of their cession to Great Britain ( by the Sultan of Muscat in 1854 they are technically i | British territory . As such they are regarded as a dependency of the Aden Residency, but are not part of H the Aden Protectorate, the control of which is now vested in the Colonial Office. 4. In practice, however, the Resident at Aden has no dealings and no means of communication with them. Their history and present condition was described in this Residency letter No.A-l74-2502, dated the 20th AprilApril 1929. 5. Hitherto the status and control of these Islands have been of little practical importance, but the establishment of Royal Air Force Sea-plane bases between Aden and the Persian Gulf is leading to increased contact with their neighbourhood and it appears desirable that the question of their control should be settled. The mainland adjacent to them is within the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and I suggest that questions affecting them - including the application received from Messrs. Hunter and Company - would be dealt with by him more conveniently and more suitably than by the Resident at Aden. I have the honour to be, etc., (SGD.) B.R. REILLY. Resident, etc.COPY Bxtract from a letter dated the 14th January 1931 from Messrs. Hunter and Company of Harbin. We, the undersigned, viz. James Alexander Hunter a British born Subject, born, at Maryborough, Queensland Australia, in 1886, and Mr. Joh.B.Kunst, a German citizen both residing at Harbin, North Manchuria, China, beg to apply herewith for a concession to explore deposits of Guano or Phosphate, and to work such as may be found workable subject to the conditions to be stipulated by the Political Residency of Aden, on the following two groups of Islands, viz:- (a) The Kuria Muria Islands. To the best of our knowledge only one of these five islands, viz. Hallaniya, is inhabited, and we engage to respect any property rights of the native inhabitants may proffer to any deposits of Guano or Phosphate which possibly may have been discovered on the said island. The other four islands, and notably Haski island, on which the most promising indications of workable deposits of Guano or Phosphate thus far known to us are located, to the best of our knowledge neither have been inhabited at any time nor are they being made use of or by the inhabitants of Hallaniya island,^of the adjacent coast of Arabia, or anybody else, so it seems that no private property rights to them, such as could conflict with our claim, can possibly exist. We are aware that the Kuria Muria Islands have been leased for the exploitation of Guano Deposits in 1856 (eighteen hundred and fifty-six) but assume that the rights of the then concessionaires have lapsed long since.4.

M JUN0 H . The islands were valuable only for the guano deposits which were found on them and which are now exhausted. Her late Majesty Queen Victoria granted a x license, dated the 20th February, 1856, to John Ord, of Litherland, near Liverpool, Joseph Hindson, and James Henshall Hayes, of Liverpool, for the sole and exclusive right, for the term of 5 years, to raise and take away guano and other substances capable of being used in manuring land. This project, however, failed, Mr. Ord and his men being expelled from the island by the Arabs. 3. A British telegraph station was established there in 1859 and removed in 1860 in consequence of failure of the cable.4. The Political Agent, Muscat, who was asked in 1926 to give some inforaation about the present condition of the islands, replied that the only inhabited one of the group was AX Hallaniah, where a patriarchal family was living, the total population being 35, and that the remainder of the islands appeared to be inhabited mainly by noxious insects of various kinds. 5. Although the islands are British by treaty, it appears that they have never been administerei o r formally annexed to British India, vide footnote one page 273 of Naylor*s Manual revised up to 1st January 1892.

If so, why did this elucidation become necessary now ? (b) Was the Government of Bombay consulted with regard to this transaction ? If not, why not ? Sir Denys Bray : (a) While the Bill was before Parliament, the question arose whether the expression “ Aden ” covered its dependen cies like Perim, or whether a specific reference to them was desirable. The Government of India, on being consulted, advised the latter. (b) There was no necessity to consult the Government of Bombay since the point was one not of substance but of drafting. Mr. Gaya Prasad Singh : Is it not a fact that, in the Bill as originally introduced, there was no specific mention of the hinterland of Aden being included in the term Aden t Sir Denys Bray : I think my Honourable friend is under some slight misapprehension. What he says is perfectly true ; but the point actually before Parliament was not that, but this : Aden, for the purposes of the Government of India Act, include Aden settlement and also certain de pendencies, like Perim and the famous Kuria Muria islands, the in habitants of which comprise one patriarchal family, and an unstated num ber of noxious insects. (Laughter.) The only point in Parliament was whether the term Aden automatically included Kuria Muria and so forth, or whether those dependencies should specially be referred to in the Bill. Mr. Gaya Prasad Singh : Is it a fact that the Government of India made a suggestion to His Majesty’s Government defining the expression Aden, after the introduction of the original Bill in Parliament ? Sir Denys Bray : That is so, Sir. For information, W. T. OTTEWILL. X NOTE.- -A copy has also been referred to ^ Department.

I am to add that the fact that the islands are named in the definition of Aden given in Section 2 of Aden Laws Regulation II of 1391 is not actually a ground for holding that they are not covered by the definition.^C If the islands are a dependency of Aden and are administered by Bombay through the Resident (as it appears they must be held to be) they are e_o fhcto included in the definition.
