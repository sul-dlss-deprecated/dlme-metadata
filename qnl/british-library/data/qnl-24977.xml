Having been appointed by you a Committee to submit proposals for a Constitution for Mesopotamia in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations and the published declarations of His Majesty’s Government and with due regard to the communicatons you have received from His Majesty’s Government, we have the honour to submit this preliminary report. ft 'A* ~ v ' COVENANT OF LEAGUE AND ANGLO-FRENCH DECLARATION. 2. Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Anglo- French Declaration of the 8 th November, 1918, are set out in Appendix A to this report. CONDITIONS LAID DOWN FOR THE CONSTITUTION. m 3. The conditions which the Constitution must fulfil may be sum marized as follows: — (a) Subject to the tutelage of a Mandatory Power the Government must be an indigenous Government. (b) The form of Government must be adopted by the free will of the people subject to such powers as are necessary to enable the Mandatory Power to perform its mandate. (c) The Constitution must contain the necessary securities to enable the Mandatory Power to perform the trust confided to it, of ensuring the well-being and development of the people. This implies the maintenance of peace and order.. 0 LOCAL FACTORS. 4. Amongst the chief factors which require consideration in the pre paration of a constitution for Mesopotamia, attention may be drawn to the following: — (1) The most recent estimate of the population of Mesopotamia, which however is liable to wide margins of error and is subject to revision, is set out in appendix B. The population, exclusive of that of Sulaimaniyah, is estimated at 2,694,282. Of these 992,785 are Sunnis and 1,494,015 are Shi'ahs. The Sunnis are in a large majority in the northern part of the country whilst the Shi‘ahs are in a large majority in the southern. The dividing line may be drawn roughly east and west through Baghdad. (2) The Turkish Government being Sunni, the Shi'ahs sect has for many generations been oppressed. The sect was not recognised in the schools or in the Courts of Law, and Shi £ ah religious teachers were excluded from all public benefits. Broadly speaking Shi‘ahs were entirely excluded from Government employment. The tenets of the Shi‘ah sect are a potential source of difficulty to any Government. For it is claimed for the Shi‘ah Mujtahids, who are the chief religious authorities, that they are divinely inspired and that their decisions are superior in authority to those of the State. The senior Mujtahids of Najaf and Karbala are the leading Mujtahids of the Shi‘ah world. They look to Persia rather than to Mesopotamia, and they influence and are influ enced by public opinion in Persia. In the presence of the Foreigner of an alien religion and as a result of the increase of national feeling which has resulted from the war, there is atpresent a certain drawing together of sections of the Shi‘ah and Sunni Com munities. But if the Occupying* Power were to withdraw the differences between them wxmld widen and would at an early date lead to open rupture. ()3) Amongst Arabs both in Mesopotamia and elsewhere who still live undent a tribal system of government, tribal feeling is stronger than racial feeling. The Turks never possessed sufficient force, nor were they capable of a sufficiently wise and steady policy, to maintain control over tribes remote from the centres of Government. For some ten years before the war the lowerJSuphrates had been in a state of armed rebellion. ' f) The free Arab tribesman, both in Mesopotamia and elsewhere, has alwa s affected contempt for towns and has despised town dwellers. The tow/ 'nan on the other hand, even if of tribal origin, considers himself on a sup r level of civilisation to the tribesman, and in general has no sympathy foi/ »esmen or tribal civilisaton. The natural antagonism between the two cUsses^has been increased in Mesopotamia by the Turkish policy of making grants of tribal land to townsmen, a policy which, except in areas close to the towns, led to perpetual friction between the townsmen landlords and the tribesmen cultivators, and culminated in the tribesmen appealing to force and ejecting the landlords or refusing* to allow them or their agents to visit the districts where their lands were situated. The antagonism between the two classes was also increased by the exac tions and dishonesty of the minor officials employed by the Turks, who were usually townsmen. (5) Under the Turks the most important administrative positions in the country were filled by Turks. The minor administrative positions, which were filled by natives of the country, were poorly paid and did not attract the better classes. Few men who held them withstood the corrupting influ ences which were rife under the Turkish regime. The country therefore at the present time is almost devoid of natives who have had previous administra tive experience of any value, and in this respect it differs materially from Egypt as it was in 1882. ( 6 ) The standard of education in the country is very low, and except amongst the Jews and Christians* there is a total absence of men -who have received an education on Western lines. The country is at least two generations behind Egypt in respect of education. Amongst the more pro minent Mohammedans in Baghdad we cannot recall anyone who can speak or write a European language. (7) The present administration have had the greatest difficulty in finding Mohammedans who are competent to fill even the lower admin 1 ’strative appointments. We are of opinion that where a native of the country can be found cap able of filling an administrative post, he shoiild be employed in preference to any other person. We are also’ of opinion that on this canon it will soon be possible to employ more natives of the country than hitherto, and in higher posts. But we desire to place it on record definitely that in the tribal areas for many years to come direct control by British Officers in charge of Divisions is a sine qua non, since no one else commands the confidence of the people to a degree which will* ensure obedience to the orders of Government without the presence and not infrequent use of armed force. NECESSITY OF SAFEGUARDS. 5. If the above short summary of some of the factors which must be taken into account in the preparation of a Constitution for Mesopotamia em phasizes the difficulties which have to be surmounted in the establishment of an indigenous form of Government rather than the objections incidental to the establishment of a form of Government which is not indigenous it is because there is no difficulty in framing a native constitution on paper. The Turks were adepts at the art. The difficulty lies in framing a form of gov ernment which while giving real power to the native element will yet hold out reasonable prospects of maintaining peace, law and liberty. And this can only be done if safeguards are introduced to overcome the above difficulties. OPINION OF NOTABLES IN 1919. 6 . The Anglo-French declaration of the 8 th November, 1918, stipulates that the form of Government to be set up should be adopted by the free will of the people. This is necessarily subject to the provision of the Covenant of the League of Nations that the people are subject to the tutelage of the Man datory Power. It is not an easy matter, even in a country which has long been accus tomed to self-government, to ascertain the will of the people. In Meso potamia, where the majority of the population have no knowledge of political science and no political experience, the matter presents special difficulties.3 In accordance with instructions from His Majesty’s Government, the following- questions were, in the spring- of 1919, put to the leading men in every Division : — ^ ' * • O' * (1) Do you favour an Arab state stretching from the northern bound ary of Mosul to the Persian Gulf? (2) In that event, do you favour an Arab Ruler? (3) In that case, whom do you prefer as head? Public opinion was unanimously in favour of the establishment- of a - single state extending from Mosul to the Persian Gulf. ■ 7 The Jews and Christians were in favour of direct British rule^, v The very great majority of Muslim opinion advocated British protecton, ant, iny favoured, at least temporarily, direct British rule. / &gt; The majority were against the immediate appointment of an An^jjut an influential minority (especially at Baghdad, and the Shi‘ah religious towns of Karbala, Najaf and Kadhimain) were in favour of such an appoint- ■* ment. The enquiry produced in the towns considerable excitement and / an ebullition of fanaticism. The enquiry covered only three points in the Constitution and cannot, we think, be regarded as a complete fulfilment of the Anglo-French Declaration. ASCERTAINMENT OF THE OPINION OF THE PEOPLE. 7. We think it necessary that a more thorough attempt should be made to ascertain what the wishes of the people are, but we consider that before this can be done with hope of success:— * (a) The mandate must be granted. • (b) The government of the country lyust be carried«on for a short time under a provisional constitution to allow the country to setfje down after the disturbances caused by the war. MANDATE SHOULD BE.GRANTED SOON. 8 . Until a mandate is granted it is impossible to elicit a frank expres sion of opinion. The great majority of the population accept the occupation and are content to accept such form of Government as the Occupying Power may set up. But there are various sections of the population which are not so content. These include some of the most important relig-ious authorities; a small but active section of political agitators, mostly centered in Baghdad; all the pro-Turk party; and a small Syrian party. We have already experienced the influence which they are able to exert in Baghdad and Najaf by appeal to religious and national feelings. It is difficult for men of moderate views to resist the pressure which the extremists can bring on them by representing that in accepting tutelage by a Christian Power they are betraying their faith and their race. The extremists have on their side all the strength of an appeal to emotion and to religious pre judice, and the all possibilities of corruption. It would not be fair to the supporters of the policy of a mandate that they should again be liable to be abused as unbelievers 'and traitors; and in the absence of any declaration of future policy on our part we cannot expect the indefinite continuance of support. With the possibility that the Turk will return, no honest opinion can be expected from a considerable section of the population. To allay unrest and to enable the British Government to define and explain their policy, the mandate should be granted as soon as possible. We therefore recommend that a mandate should be granted at the earliest possible date. Following the wording of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the effect of the mandate will presumably be to entrust to the Mandatory Power the tutelage of Mesopotamia to be exercised by them on behalf of the League. We consider it desirable that the mandate should state that the Mandatory Power is vested with the necessary powers to carry out the mandate, e.q. (in the words of the Covenant) to secure “ the well-being and development of the people ”. NECESSITY FOR A PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTION. 9. It appears to us that there would be very great difficulty in ascer taining the wishes of the people immediately the mandate has been granted. It is true that a definite announcement of the conditions on which His Majesty’sThere is no doubt that when the notables of the country were consulted as to whether or not they desired an Amir, the large majority of the popula tion were opposed to an Amir. There is no person in the country of a sufficiently outstanding posifkm to be generally acceptable as an Amir. Since the notables were last consulted, owing to the elimination of other candidates and to the fact that Faisul has for the time being made good his claims to Syria, the party in favour of having one of the sons of the Sharif of Mecca as Amir has grown in strength. If the issue whether or not there should be an Amir were now put to an Assembly we think it possible that the answer would be in the affirmative and that Abdul lah, or one of the other sons of the Sharif, would be chosen. It by no leans follows that the same would be the case a few months hence. Having regard to the divisions in religious opinion in the country 1 to local jealousies, no one who has been mentioned as a candidate up to the mt would be able to retain his position except through the support of the la- tory Power. On the other hand an Amir, who did nut loyally accept th^rfTTm- date, would be a source of embarassment to the Mandatory Power and of weakness to the country. If the stories which have reached this country of posts and appointments made by Abdullah, or in his name, to his Syrian sup porters are true, it would not, we think, be possible to accept his nomination; and there is the general objection to the establishment of any member of the Sharif’s family as Amir of ‘Iraq, that the appointment would be extremely unpopular with the Amir of Najd and with other independent Arab Rulers. These considerations, in our opinion, strengthen the arguments for delay which we have set forth in paragraph 9. In the rest of t^is report we assume that during the period of the Provi sional Constitution there will be no Amir. COUNCIL OF STATE (OR OF MINISTERS). 15. (1) We recommend the establishment of a Council of i^tate to act as the principal executive authority of the*State, and, as explained later, as a Second Chamber of the Legislature. - (2) The Council of State to consist of a President and say eleven members each appointed by the High Commissioner and removeable from the Council at his pleasure. (3) The President to be an Arab, the first President to hold office until the constitutional question has been submitted to the Assembly. He should not necessarily be connected with any departmental work. As he would be in a sense the Arab head of the State, he ought to be a person of good social status and prestige, and have leisure for sooial functions. It might not be possible to find such a man who would, be willing and capable of departmental work. (4) The Members of Council to be either Members for a particular Depart ment of State or Secretaries of a Department of State. A Member who is un able to attend to be represented by a Deputy. (5) The Constitution should not lay down how many members of the Council should be Arab and how many English. We contemplate that in practice, to start with, a majority of the members would be English. If the members excluding the President are eleven in all we suggest that to start with six should be English and five Arab. Tims in practice the Council might be composed as follows: — English. Arab. President ... ... ... ... — 1 Department of Interior ... ... ... I 1 Department of Justice ... ... ... 1 1 Revenue (including lands) ... ... I 1 Education ... ... '... ... 1 1 Finance ... ... ... ... 1 — Public Works or Health ... ... ... 1 Auqaf ... ... ... ... — 1 6 6 Departments which were not directly represented on the Council would be represented by one or other of the members of the Council: thus if the Secretary of Commerce is not a member he might be represented by the Secretary for the Interior. (6) The President of the Council to have a vote only in case of equality of votes. (7) The High Commissioner to have the power of over-ruling the decision of the majority of the Council and thereupon the decision of the High Commis sioner to be deemed for all purposes the decision of the Council.(8&gt; The Council of State to be the Chief Executive Authority of the State. State executive decisions, and executive decisions of the various depart ment- issued to the public, should be issued in the name of the Council of State. (9) The British Secretary of a Department, to begin with, to be the Chief Executive Official of the Department. Arab Members of Council to be attached to various departments, to be consulted by the Secretary on all mat ters of importance and to have access to all departmental papers: and to have the right to refer to the Council of State any difference of opinion between thenpelves and the Secretaries. Other departments (except perhaps some of •the J^hhnical departments, e.q., Public Works) in which there were no Arab mer Y'S of Council, would yet ordinarily have Arab Advisers or Assistants. v Arab Members of Council not to be necessarily selected from the Leg^itive Assembly, but to be e.r-officio members of the Assembly with the right to vote. British Secretaries of Departments and other heads of Departments to have the power to attend the Legislative Assembly and to speak, but not to vote. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. CONSTITUTION. 17. (1) We think it necessary that the Legislative Body either be elect ed, or, which seems to us preferable, appointed by Local Bodies who will themselves be elected. This would however not apply to the Arab Members of the Council of State who, we have advised, should be e.r-officio members of the Legislative Assembly. The present Divisional Councils are in fact probaflbly more representative of the people than they would be under a system of election^ but as they are nominated bodies, a Legislative Council elected by them would be^open to the objection that they were the nominees of the British Authorities. The method of election requires further study and con- siTltation with local authorities, and we are not in a position to submit final recommendations; but we submit in Appendix C methods of election which, subject to modifications to suit local requirements, we believe to be practicable. (2) The exact composition of the Legislative Assembly also requires fur ther study. We suggest provisionally it should include: — (a) Elected members for the towns and country districts approximately proportionate to their population on the basis of one to 50,000 inhabitants; (b) elected members representing the Jewish and Christian Com munities ; (c) Arab members of the Council of State who, as we have already advised, should be ex-officio members. (3) On the above lines we calculate that the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly, including the ex-officio members of the Council of State, would work out at about 50. (4) The President of the Legislative Council should be an Arab nominated by the Council of State. He should not necessarily be an elected member, as it may very well be found that among the elected members there is no suitable candidate for the post. (5) In spite of the disadvantages under which they would labour, we think that, in view of the difficulty of finding competent Arab members of the Executive Council, British Secretaries of Departments should have the right to attend the Assembly and to speak and introduce measures but not to vote. (6) There should be a British Joint-Secretary to the Assembly to assist in matters of Procedure. (7) Members of the Legislative Assembly would receive a fixed allow ance per session. FUNCTIONS OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. 18. (1) The Egyptian Organic Law of 1913, may serve as a precedent subject to modifications. (2) Laws to be issued and taxes imposed by the Council of State— (a) normally with the concurrence of the Legislative Council; (b) but if the Assembly refuse to pass the Law in the way desired by the Council of State, the Council of State after conferences and again submitting the Law, to have power to issue without their consent.V . . f \\ e consider it essential that the Council of State should in case oi neces sity have power to pafss laws without the concurrence of the Legislative Assembly. (c) There might he a provision that Bills submitted to the Assembly, if not rejected before prorogation, may he deemed to have been passed. (3) As under the Turkish Constitution, the Council of State to have power to issue Temporary Laws, which however must he submitted to the next session of the Legislative Assembly. (4) Private members to have power to initiate Legislation, except s re gards constitutional matters and taxation. (5) The Assembly to have power to pass resolutions as to matte on- cerning internal government of Mesopotamia. If Government d« lot accept them it must explain reasons. (6) Annual Budget to be issued by Decree of Council of State, to be previously submitted to Legislative Assembly for advice and observation. If advice offered not accepted, reasons must be given. No existing rate of taxation to be increased or new tax imposed except by a Law. (7) Annual accounts to be submitted for remarks. (8) Members may ask questions in writing. THE CAPITULATIONS. 18. Except for the limited suggestions put forward as regards reserva tions in favour of foreigners, the foregoing proposals take no account flf f the exceptional position which the capitulations gave to foreign powers. This Committee has no information as to the policy of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the capitulations. It may- well be that,* as a condition of foregoing their rights under the capitulations, foreign powers may insist qji safeguards or some representation in the Government. The Committee has not the information to enable them to put forward proposals. Safeguards which should not he difficult to devise would also he neces sary as regards the jurisdiction of the Court-s over foreigners, at least in the case of penal jurisdiction. i ? ' ENQUIRY INTO WORKING OF SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AFTER A PERIOD OF YEARS. 19. In conclusion we advise that, besides the examination of the con stitution provided for in paragraph 9, there should he at the end of a fixed period of years (say seven) an enquiry into the working of the system of Gov ernment, the growth of education, and matters connected therewith, with a view to making recommendations whether and to what extent it is desirable to modify the system of Government and to extend or restrict the power of self-go vern m ent. Presumably the enquiry would he undertaken by His Majesty’s Govern ment. If so, the arrangement should he set out in a recital rather than place.d in the body of the document establishing the Constitution. • • E.

TREATY OF PEACE BETWEEN THE ALLIED AND ASSOCIATED POWERS AND GERMANY. Signed at Versailles, June 28tli, 1919 PART I. The Covenant of the League of Nations. Article 22 .—To those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the Lite war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which forujRrly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stamlvby themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, thej^'hould be applied the principle that the well-being and development ■of Ty * peoples form a sacred trust of civilization and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in this Covenant. The best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility and who are willing to accept it, and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as Mandatories on behalf of the League. The character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people, the geographical situation of the territory, its economic conditions and other similar circumstances. Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stag-e of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal con- siden^ion in the selection of the Mandatory. Other peoples, especially those of Central Africa, are at such a stage that the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions v*hich will guarantee freedom of conscience and religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic and the liquor traffic, and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other Members of the League. There are territories, such as South-West Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, dr their remoteness from the centres of •civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory, and other circum stances, can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above-mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population. In every case of mandate, the Mandatory shall render to the Council an annual report in reference to the territory committed to its charge. The degree of authority, control or administration to be exercised by the Mandatory shall, if not previously agreed upon by the Members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Council. A permanent Commission shall be constituted to receive and examine the annual reports of the Mandatories and to advise the Council on all matters relating to the observance of the mandates. APPENDIX A (ii). Anglo-French Declaration of November 8th, 1918. The end which France and Great Britain have in view in their prosecu tion in the East of the war let loose by German ambition is the complete and •definite liberation of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks and the -establishment of National Governments and Administrations drawing their Authority from the initiative and free choice of indigenous populations. In order to give effect to these intentions France and Great Britain are agreed to encourage and assist the establishment of indigenous Governments in Syria ancl Mesopotamia, which have already in fact been liberated by the Allies, and in countries whose liberation they are endeavouring to effect and to recognise the latter as soon as they shall be effectively established. Far from wishing to impose any particular institution on these lands, they have no other care but to assure by their support and effective aid the normal work ing of the Governments and Administrations, which they shall have adopted of their own free will. To ensure impartial and equal justice, to facilitate economic development by working and encouraging indigenous initiative, to fostei; the spread of education and to put an end to the divisions too long •exploited by Turkish Policy : such is the role which the two allied Govern ments assume in the liberated territories.wma 10 They are t-Jiemselves elected by the tribesmen under them, and they elect the Shaikh of the Tribe subject to confirmation by the Authorities. In areas where the tribal system is not in force the problem is more diffi cult Such areas may include small towns, villages and in a few places a sea. ”ed resident population. In the small towns there would be no diffi culty in forming municipalities in accordance with the Turkish Law. In villages and areas with a scattered population, councils of elders for the village or area (nahiyah), which were supposed to exist under Turkish Law but which in practice rarely did exist in Mesopotamia, might be formed. The jnunicipalities of the small towns, and the village and “nahiyah cou) Us might appoint delegates in numbers proportionate to their inhabit ant and such delegates could meet together and elect the member of the Divioional Council. We think a system of selection on the above lines is best suited to the requirements of the tribal areas. It could not however be brought into force immediately, for some of the present Divisional Councils which are nominated bodies have only been recently formed and to dismiss them at once would rouse the resentment of members, many of whom have done useful work and deserve well of us. It is necessary therefore to have an alternative method. Method B. —(1) Members for towns large enough to be represented by one or more members to be elected by the Municipal electors. (2) Members for Districts where the tribal system is in force to be elected by the tribal headmen or by delegates appointed by such headmen. (3) Small towns and villages, and areas where the tribal system is not in force, to be grouped together. The municipalities of such small towns and the village or district councils to choose delegates proportional to their number who would meet and elect their member. &gt; • ** APPENDIX D, * QUALIFICATIONS FOE CANDIDATES OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.

Brief Summary of the report of the Committee follows. Telegram—R. Pty. From—Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. To—Secretary of State for India, London. No. 5111. Dated 26th April, 1920. My immediately preceding telegram. —Committee summarise conditions which constitution must fulfil as follows: — (a) Subject to the tutelage of a Mandatory Power the Government must be an indigenous Government. (b) The form of Government must be adopted by the free will of the people subject to such powers as are necessary to enable the Mandatory Nation to give effect to its mandate. (c) The Constitution must contain the necessary securities to enable the Mandatory Power to perform the trust confided to it of ensuring the well-being and development of the people. This implies the maintenance of peace and order.12 7’wo.—Committee draws attention to the following factors which require consideration in this connection. (a) The population of Mesopotamia consists roughly of a million Sunnis and million Shi‘ahs, the former being in the large majority in the north and the latter in the south, dividing line being drawn roughly east and west through Baghdad. (b) Shi‘ah sect has for many generations been oppressed. They were not recognised in Schools or Courts, their teachers were excluded from public benefits. * (c) Shi‘ah tenets are however a potential source of difficulty to any Government, for it is claimed that the decision of Mujtahids transcend those of any secular authority. (d) There is at present a tendency for Shi‘ahs and Sunnis to coalesce but this is a result of our occupation and were we to withdraw an open rupture between the two sects would follow very soon. (e) Tribal feeling is stronger than racial feeling amongst Tribal Arabs. ihe lurks neither had the force nor the wisdom requisite to maintain control over tribes and for some years before the War the Lower Euphrates had been in a state of armed rebellion. Tribesmen despise townspeople who reciprocate. Turkish Land Policy has increased estrangement between the two classes and dishonest officials invariably appointed from town have made the feeling still more acute. (/) Tinder Turks all important Administrative positions were filled by Turks. Such Administrative posts as were filled by local inhabitants were poorly paid and did not attract the better classes, and few men who held them withstood corruption. The • country therefore at the present time is almost devoid of natives who have had previous administrative experience of any value, and in this respect it differs materially from Egypt as it was in 1832. (g) The standard of education in this country is very low, and except amongst the Jews and Christians there is a total absence of men who have received an education on Western lines. The country is at least two generations behind Egypt in respect of education. Amongst the more prominent Muhammadans in Baghdad Com mittee cannot recall anyone who can speak or write a European language. (h) The present administration have had the greatest difficulty in find ing Muhammadans competent to fill even the lower administrative appointments. (i) Committee desire to place it on record definitely that in the tribal areas for many years to come direct control by British Officers is a sine qua non, since no one else commands the confidence of the people to a degree which will ensure obedience to the orders of Government without the presence and not infrequent use of armed force. Three .—There is no difficulty in framing on paper a Native Constitution. The Turks were adepts at the art but difficulty lies in framing a form of Gov ernment which will give a real power to native element and yet hold out reasonable prospects of maintaining peace, law and liberty. And this can only be done if safeguards are introduced to overcome the above difficulties. Four. The Committee consider it necessary that a fuller attempt should be made to ascertain the wishes of the people but consider that before this can be done with a hope of success:— (a) A mandate must be granted. (b) After grant of mandate the Government of the country must be carried on for a short time under a provisional constitution to allow the country to settle down. (c) They consider it impossible to elicit frank expression of opinion until a mandate has been granted and extremely difficult for some lime afterwards and urge that this should be done soon. They express the opinion that it is desirable that mandate should state that Mandatory Power is vested with the necessarv powers to carry out the mandate. Five .—They recommend the formation of a Legislative Assembly on lines proposed below whose opinion as to the nature of Constitution within the limits imposed by the terms of the mandate should be ascertained not later than 2 years from date of mandate, till when country should be governed under provisional constitution outlined below.rr-'V-v* V &gt; 13 * Six .—Committee makes specific recommendations regarding terms of mandate which should he embodied in the documents establishing provisional constitution. Seven .—Reservation of authority to Mandatory Power. (a) Committee consider that the document establishing the Constit ^^n should make it clear that the Mandatory Power possesses the necessary powers to fulfil the mandate. {b) External affairs, foreign relations, including treaties and war, should be reserved to the Mandatory Power. (c) As regards internal affairs it should be made clear that the Manda tory Power has the right to insist that its advice on matters which it considers essential for'the well-being and development of the people will he followed. {d) Reservation will also be necessary regarding foreign subjects and religious rights. (e) Committee remark that if these powers are laid down in the Con stitution much future misunderstanding will be avoided and observe that a great deal of the bitterness now’ existing in Egypt is due to the undefined position which Great Britain has occupied in that country. (f) Committee do not recommend the appointment of an Amir at pre sent although such appointment would in theory facilitate establishment of an Arab State on lines desired by H.M.G. but it wdll be open to Legislative Assembly in two years or sooner if High ( ommissioner thinks it desirable to make recommenda tions in this connection for the consideration of the Mandatory Pow r er.

Under provisional constitution Government would be carried on by Council of State and a Legislative Assembly. Council of State— One to be the principal executive authority and the second Chamber of Legislature. All State executive decisions and executive decisions of depart ments issued to public to issue in its name— 1 ico to consist of say 11 members and the President all nominated by High Commissioner— Three —President to be an Arab of good status and prestige and not neces sarily connected with a Government department— Four—members to be either Arab members for departments or British Secretaries for Departments (British Secretaries remain Chief Executive authority of departments but Arab members for departments to be consulted on all impoitant matters and have access to all papers. In some departments, e.y., P.W.D. there would be no Arab member but an Arab adviser or assistant)— Five —the Constitution should not specify relative numbers of British and Arab members. In practice at first there would be English majority for example 6 to 5 who might represent following departments Arabs' Interior, Justice, Rev enue, Education, Amjat; British Interior, Justice, Revenue, Education, hinance, P.W.D.

One —members to be elected, or preferably chosen by elected local bodies. Method of election requires further study and consultation with local author ities but Committee consider election of local bodies which would be really representative quite practicable and put up tentative proposals— Two —to number about 50 members and consist of (1) elected members for town and country at rate of one member to about 50,000 inhabitants (2) members elected separately by Jewish and Christian communities and (3) Arab members of Council— Three —President to be an Arab nominated by the Council of State. Owing to lack of experience of Arabs in public affairs he would not necessarily be chosen from elected members. Functions of Legislative Assembly— One —The Egyptian Organic Law of 1913 may serve as a precedent subject to modifications— Two —Laws to be issued and taxes imposed by the Council of State nor mally with concurrence of Legislative Assembly but without this concurrence if Assembly refuse to pass law after joint sessions and submission of law a second time. Committee consider it essential to retain for the Council of State power to pass laws without the Assembly’s concurrence in case of necessity— Three —Council of State to have power enjoyed by Council of Ministers under Turkish Constitution to pass temporary laws on condition that these are submitted to the following session of the Legislative Assembly. Fo%t,r —Private members to have power to initiate legislation, except as regards constitutional matters and taxation. Five —The Assembly to'have power to pass resolutions as to matters con cerning internal government of Mesopotamia. If Government does not accept them it must explain reasons.

From ClvCom Baghdad To Wingate Muscat. No.7910dated 30/6/2Q. Your letter dated the 13th June 1296 I have decided to put all our deportees on HenJam. I have hiwever not yet made arrests in Najaf.lith June XV Thought for a moment that my sins were to recoil on my head, ^ut I think I told you, from bitter experience that all the persons mentioned by you were v ry ian^rous. Mohaln Shellash is a strange case. In political matters he is unreliable, though ho is fairly pro us if treated right. Even when I was there he had a sentimental and intellectual leaning towards the entirely Arab state. His financial dealings are also bound to involve him in all this Intrigue, Sayid Alwan is one dangerous of the most and intelligent men in Iraq, I imagine Abdul Wahid al Haji Sikar is one of the Mishkhab people. He is also clever. I probably know these people better than anybody else and I really believe that their desire for an Arab state is a perfectly genuine thing. They are all very wealthy and very intelligent, Theyx Tr^re never ruled, by the Turks* They have complete Tiold over their fellahs or tribesman, and the proximity cf Naj&amp;f makes them perfectly safe. They are the mofit civilised of Agricultural Arab. You are up against a vary different thing with these people than with the majority of the tribal Arabs, However this is not the point, as I am now speaking after a year, it is the question of the probable effect of such people in Muscat even if only for si;-; months, Vuscat ir&gt; very cut off from the world, and above all from the rest of Arabia. Ac far as I know the panArab movement has as v et not spread here or in Oman f though a recent report mentiore tne intention of a panislamic society of sending delegate. 1 * to Muscat. A few of the mo^-e intelligent Arab mercirmts speak a out the matter in a vague way, but there is not much danger of luscat itself which looks to India which is of c&lt;antiArab, ever taking up the cry with anthuaiaan* With tha interior it is howaver very different. There for the moment a* owing to.^t^eiT intense ignorance the British still have a name, and it is by the policy of making the Sultan strong and making the people of the interior realise that we are behind him that I hope to alleviate the Muscat muddle. But should the panArab cry be raised, w the Sultan is a creature of the British, and the Imam stands for Arab freedom etc ', the effect might be serious. These people if brought to Muscat would certainly raise this cry. There is nothing for them do except Intrigue, and neither I nor the. Sultan ceii stop |j - them communicating with the interior. They are very wealthy and even if they were on subsistence allowances I know of many merchants here who would honour theii* drafta for about twenty lakhs . Here I am surrounded by a web of Intrigue, and I have no system of comba&amp;ing it except by myself as I have no auali' ami no money. The bultan or Maocollua are In even woase e^ce as there le not a man whom they can trust. The pi whence of such people will be a very great embarassaent to them, arid also to me, an t»ne whole of tne politics with the interior are conducted by me ( under tne rose )• I can assure you that I have never faced ouch a difficult Job. I am desperately overworked as tnia is entirely a one man job. It lu for these reasons that I hope you will not add to my anxieties by putting these people whom unforcuhately I know only too ^ell,in Muscat if there is any oth r reasonable alternative* Z nave no-, the wind up xn aiiy way but I am bound to take all reasonable precautions. I agree that Muscat would be a terrible penance for them. I have never struck such an appalling climate in my life. The Sultan is not yet back and I expectwill put off hie return till the last possible moment. Mac Collum will be going on leave to India till the beginning of August shortly. He must get away.

My wife has been very ill In India.Summary of a report by a Committee appointed by the Civil Commissioner to submit proposals for a Constitution for Mesopotamia in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations and the published declarations of His Majesty’s Government. The Committee consisted of the following persons :— SIR E. BONHAM CARTER, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., Judicial Secretary, Chairman of the Committee. LT.-COL. E. B. HOWELL, C.S.I., C.I.E., I.C.S., Revenue Secretary. MAJOR H. F. M. TYLER, C.I.E., I.C.S., Political OJJicer, Hillah. LT.-COL. F. C. C. BALFOUR, C.I.E, M.C., M.G., &amp; P.O., Baghdad. MAJOR R. W. BULLARD, C.I.E., Deputy Revenue Secretary, Secretary to the Committee. 1. Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations read$ thus : TREATY OF PEACE BETWEEN THE ALLIED AND ASSOCIATED POWERS AND GERMANY. Signed at Versailles, June 28th, 1919. PART I. The Covenant of the League of Nations Article 22. To those colonies and territories which. as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which’are inhabited b\ peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilization and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in this Covenant. The best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best undertake this responsibility and who are willing to accept it and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as Mandatories on behalf of the League. The character of the Mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people, the geographical situation of the territory, its economic.conditions and other similar circum Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of deve lopment wheie their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of adihinistrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory. In every case of Mandate, the Mandatory shall render to the Council an annual report in refer ence to the territory committed to its charge. The degree of authority, control or administration to be exercised by the Mandatorv shall if not previously agreed upon by the Members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case the Council. ' uy A permanent Commission shall be constituted to receive and examine the annual reports of the Mandatories and to advise the Council on all matters relating to the observance of the Mandates. (A portion of Article 22, relating only to such territories as Central Africa and the Pacifir Islands, has been omitted.) , / THE ANGLO-FRENCH DECLARATION OF NOVEMBER 8th, 1918, says 2. 1 he end which France and Great Britain have in view in their prosecution in the East of the war let loose by German ambition is the complete and definite liberation of the peoples so* lomt oppressed by the Turks and the establishment of National Governments and Administrations draw mg their Authority from the initiative and free choice of indigenous populationsIn order to give effect to these intentions France and Great Britain are agreed to encourage and assist the establishment of indigenous Governments in Syria and Mesopotamia, which have already in fact been liberated by the Allies, and in countries whose liberation they are endeavouring to effect and to recognize the latter as soon as they shall be effectively established. Far from wishing to impose any particular institution on these lands, they have no other care but to assure by their support and effective aid the normal working of the Governments and Administrations, which they shall have adopted of their own free will. To ensure impartial and equal justice, to facilitate economic development by working and encouraging indigenous initiative, to foster the spread of education and to put an end to the divisions too long exploited by Turkish Policy : such is the role which the two allied Governments assume in the liberated territories. CONDITIONS TO BE FULFILLED BEFORE THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE CAN BE ASCERTAINED. 3. We think it necessary that an attempt should be made to ascertain what the wishes of the people are, but we consider that before this can be done with hope of success :— (a) The Mandate must be granted. (b) The government of the country must be carried on for a short time under a provisional constitution to allow the country to settle down after the disturbances caused by the war. WISHES OF THE PEOPLE TO BE EXPRESSED BY AN ELECTED LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. 4. It appears to us that there would be very great difficulty in ascertaining the wishes of the people immediately the Mandate has been granted ; and it is considered that the body which is to give its opinion on a matter of such moment as the constitution should have an opportunity to see constitutional government at work for a short time and to realize the consequences of any decision they may give. It is therefore proposed that the opinion of the Legislative Assembly (as described below) on the constitution should be ascertained, but not necessarily immediately. It should be stated, as soon as the proposals for the elections to the Assembly are published, that the Assembly v^ill be invited, not later than the third session, to discuss the constitution (within the limits imposed by the terms of the mandate), and that until then the government of the country will be carried on under the provisional constitution outlined below. It would be advisable to retain for the High Commis sioner the power to dissolve the first Assembly and to put the constitutional issue before its successor. FRAMING OF A SUITABLE FORM OF GOVERNMENT. 5. There is no difficulty in framing a constitution on paper. In Turkish times there was a complete constitution on paper, but many of its provisions were disregarded. The difficulty lies in framing a form of government which while giving real power to the native element will yet hold out reasonable prospects of maintaining peace, law and liberty. And this Ccfn only be done if safeguards are introduced. We are of opinion that where a native of the country can be found capable of filling an admin istrative post, he should be employed in preference to any other person. We are also of opinion that on this canon it will soon be possible to employ more natives of the country than hitherto, and and in higher posts. CONDITIONS LAID DOWN FOR THE CONSTITUTION. 6. The conditions which the Constitution must fulfil may he summarized as follows : {a) Subject to the tutelage of a Mandatory Power the Government must be an indigenous Government. (b) The form of Government must be adopted by the free will of the people subject to such powers as are necessary'to enable the Mandatory Power to perform its mandate. (c) The Constitution must contain the necessary securities to enable the Mandatory Power to perform the trust confided to it, of ensuring the well-being and &lt;levelopment of the people. This implies the maintenance of peace and order. MANDATE SHOULD BE GRANTED SOON. 7. We recommend that a mandate should be granted at the earliest possible date. Following the wording of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the effect of the mandate will presumably be to entrust to the Mandatory Power the tutelage of Mesopotamia to be exercised by them on behalf of the League. We consider it desirable that the Mandate should state that the Mandatory Power is vested with the necessary power to carry out the Mandate, to secure (in the words of the Covenant) “ the well-being and development of the people ”. I RECITAL OF THE MANDATE AND ITS PURPOSES. 8. We think that the document establishing the provisional constitution should recite the Mandate, the appointment of the Mandatory Power, and the objects of the Mandate as defined by the Covenant of the League and by the Mandate itself.3 RESERVATIONS IN FAVOUR OF THE MANDATORY POWER. 9. We consider that the document establishing the constitution should make it clear that the Mandatory Power possesses the necessary powers to fulfil the Mandate. As regards external affairs, foreign relations, including treaties and war, should be reserved to the Mandatory Power. . As regards internal affairs it should be made clear that the Mandatory Power has the right to insist that its advice on matters which it considers essential for the “ well-being and develop ment of the people ” (to quote the Covenant of the League) be followed. If these powers are laid down in the Constitution much future misunderstanding will be avoided. RESERVATIONS IN FAVOUR OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBJECTS. 10. Having regard to the xights formerly possessed by the Powers in Turkey and to the relations between Mesopotamia and the League of Nations, it will, we believe, be advisable that the Constitution should contain safeguards of the rights of foreign subjects. RELIGIOUS LIBERTY TO BE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. 11. We recommend that the Constitution should contain a proviso guaranteeing religiou liberty to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia. COUNCIL OF STATE (oh OF MINISTERS). 12. (1) We recommend the establishment of a Council of State to act as the principal execu tive authority of the State, and, as explained later, as a Second Chamber of the Legislature. (2) The Council of State to consist of a President and say eleven members each appointed by the High Commissioner. i (3) The President to be an Arab, the first President to hold office until the constitutional question has been submitted to the Assembly. He should not necessarily be connected with any departmental work. As he would be in a sense the Arab head of the State, he ought to be a person of good social status and prestige, and have leisure for spcial functions. It might not be possible to find such a man who would be willing to do departmental work. (4) The Members of Council to be either Members for a particular Department of State or Secretaries of a Department of State. A Member who is unable to attend to be represented by a Deputy. (5) The Council migfit be composed as follows :— President •••* . Department of Interior Department of Justice Revenue (including lands) Education Finance Public Works or Health Auqaf Arab. English. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 6 Departments which were'not directly represented on the Council would be represented by one or other of the members of the Council: thus if the Secretary of Commerce is not a member he might be represented by the Secretary for the Interior. (6) The President of the Council to have a vote only in case of equality of votes. (7) The High Commissioner to have the power of over-ruling the decision of the majority of the Council and thereupon the decision of the High Commissioner to be deemed for all purposes the decision of the Council. (8) The Council of State to be the Chief Executive Authority of the State. State executive decisions, and executive decisions of the various departments issued to the public, should be issued in the name of the Council of State. (9) The British Secretary of a Department, to begin with, to be the Chief Executive Official of the Department. Arab Members of Council to be attached to various departments, to be consulted by the Secretary on all matters of importance and to have access to all departmental papers : and to have the right to refer to the Council of State any difference of opinion between themselves and the Secretaries. Other departments (except perhaps some of the technical depart ments, e.g., Public Works) in which there were no Arab members of Council, would yet ordinarily have Arab Advisors or Assistants. (10) Arab Members of Council not to be necessarily selected from the Legislative Assembly, but to be ex-officio members of the Assembly with the right to vote; British Secretaries of Departments and other Heads of Departments to have the power to -attend the Legislative Assembly and to speak, but not to vote.4 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY—CONSTITUTION.

We suggest provisionally it should comprise (a) Elected members for the towns and country districts approximately proportionate to their population on the basis of one to 50,000 inhabitants ; (b) elected members representing the Jewish and Christian Communities ; (t) Arao members of the Council of State who, as we have already advised, should be ex-oijicio members.

(1). METHOD OF ELECTION TO LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. Method A.—(l) Members for Towns large enough to be represented by one or more members to be elected by the Municipal Councils. Such Municipal Councils to be themselves elected by tax-paying male house-holders approximately in accordance with the Turkish Municipal Law of 5th October, 1887. (2) Members for the Divisions to be elected by Divisional Councils, excluding those members of the Divisional Council who represent towns which elect their own member to the Legislative Assembly, or (if it is thought advisable) by separate panels formed out of the Divisional Council representing respectively tribesmen and non-tribesmen. The Divisional Councils to be themselves elected. T he method of the election to Divisional Councils requires further study. It is thought that in Districts where the Tribal System is still in force (and this includes much the greater part of the country) the representatives of such districts should be elected by the headmen of the tribal sub-sections. These tribal headmen are the chief men of the smallest tribal territorial unit. I hey are themselves elected by the tribesmen under them, and they elect the Shaikh of the Tribe subject to confirmation by the Authorities. In areas where the tribal system is not in force the problem is more difficult. Such areas may include small towns, villages and in a few places a scattered resident population. In the small towns there would be no difficulty in forming municipalities in accordance with the Turkish Law. In villages and areas with a scattered population, councils of elders for the village or area (nahiyah), which were supposed to exist under Turkish Law but which in practice rarely did exist in Mesopotamia, might be formed. The municipalities of the small towns, and the village and nahiyah ” councils might appoint delegates in numbers proportionate to their inhabitants and such delegates could meet together and elect the member of the Divisional Council. We think a system of selection on the above lines is best suited to the requirements of the tribal areas. It could not however be brought into force immediately, for some of the present Divisional Councils which are nominated bodies, have only been recently formed and to dismiss, them at once would rouse the resentment of members, many of whom have done useful work. It is necessary therefore to have an alternative method. • Method B. — (1) Members for towns large enough to be represented by one or more members to be elected by the Municipal electors. is in force to be elected by the tribal (2) Members for Districts where the tribal system headmen or by delegates appointed by such headmen. f3) Small towns and villages, and areas where the tribal system is not in force, to be grouped, together. The municipalities of such small towns and the village or district councils to choose delegates proportional to their number who would meet and elect their member. (2) QUALIFICATIONS FOR CANDIDATES OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. (1) 'Age : o say 30. . (2) Alust pay a fixed sum in direct taxation in the constituency, or must own immoveable property of a fixed value therein.

At baghdad the advanced mechanical transport depot was com- -pletely burnt down to day It is suspected that this was due to enemy action as it was situated in tne middle of the town. As we have had to lend the militaryx some of our civilian stock, spares are likely to be more than usually difficult to obtain for at least six months, and the greatest care should be exercised in the use of mechanical transport.

Office of the High Commissioner Baghdad, December, 1920. CIRCULAR. Ij 1 ? High Commissioner lias under consideration the conditions of Service of lintish Officers in Iraq particularly in view of the re-organization no • in progress. The policy of His Majesty’s Government is the creation of a Rational Government m ‘Iraq; and to this end a provisional Council of State lias been appointed and Ministries formed. This re-construction at Head quarters must be followed, with due regard to the local situation 1 v &lt;orrespondjng measures m the districts, and will necessitate both the reduc tion of the existing staff of British Officers and the formation of a new cadre tor those who remain. 2.

I am to add that the High Commissioner will be pleased m considei rny personal representation you may wish to make by letter in connection with the proposed scheme. C. C. GARBETT, Secretary to the High Commissioner. Telegram. From—High Commissioner, Baghdad. To—Secretary of State for India, London. No. 13639. Dated 10th November, 1920. Supposing that H.M. Government are prepared to endorse the trims thereof, more particularly the first two paragraphs. I propose to send following message to Mesopotamian Agent in Bombay and London for com munication to all Officers on leave, begins. Following applies to executive officers, i.e., P.O.’s and A.P.O.’s only. Proposals are under con- siderafion of H.M.G. for foination of peimanent Middle Eastern Civil Service. Officers selected for retention in Mesopotamian Service will automatically become members of this if and when it takes shape. No information available at present as to pay and pension of proposed service nor can it he stated whether permanent service in Mesopotamia can be guaranteed. Inauguration of National Government will involve considerable reduc tion of British executive staff and I contemplate reduction of about 50 per cent, to begin with. Please therefore state whether you desire your name put forward for retention or not. Those not selected for retention will receive same treatment in respect of gratuties as if their Contracts had been terminated by Government on three months notice. Every effort will be made to release those who are not selected for retention at the time most convenient for them. Kindly telegraph confirmation, and if text approved, instruct Mesopo tamian Agent, India Office accordingly.2 Telegram—IT From—High Commissioner, Baghdad. To—India Office, London. No. 38 S. Hated 7th December, 1920. Please -see my telegram No. 3639 of 10th November, 1920. While awaiting reply I have found it expedient to proceed further with the scheme for re-construction with .following results:— ' Firstly have appointed five officers as Advisers to the various Minis tries of the National Government. Two Adviserships are still vacant namely. Defence and Commerce and these I hope to fill in due course when suitable Officers are available. One Adviser, namely Sir Edgar Bonham Carter is leaving Mesopotamia in the spring and other vacancies may occur in I he future. In any case all the posts must be regarded as special appointments to he filled by selected Officers whencesoever obtainable and if necessary from outside the ordinary cadre. These Officers should in my opinion be engaged on five year contracts guaranteed by H.M.G. on the understanding that those of them who belong to other services of Government should be seconded from those services for that period of secondment should he extended as may he necessary hereafter. It is probable that all the Officers concerned will he .officers of Government services. ^ ^Secondly .—In addition to the above staff of Advisers at headquarters 1 an cf opinion that it will he necessary to form a service of Inspectors and Assistant Inspectors to supervise the conduct of the administration in the provinces when the administrative posts therein are filled by locally recruited personnel. The functions of such Officers will he advisory anil educational not executive though m some cases where local conditions demand it Inspectors may he appointed to act temporarily as Mutasarrifs until suitable local personnel is forthcoming. In such cases the advisory func-* tions of Inspectors will be temporarily in abeyance. Thirdly .—On my arrival here I found some 120 British Officers engaged in the work of general administration as Political Officers, etc. Of these I propose to retain only forty as Inspectors, etc. under the new scheme, dis pensing with the services of the rest on the termination of their present con- tracts. Subject to confirmation it is contemplated that these forty officers will he distributed as follows namely : four Inspectors first grade on Rs. 1,700. Six Inspectors second grade on Rs. 1,350. Ten Assistants first grade on Rs. 1,000. T en Assistants second grade on Rs. 800 and ten Assistants third grade on Rs. 600. Above rates of pay are mean rates including overseas allc-wance. Fourthly .—I should anticipate some further reduction of this Inspecting staff in the near future if things go well and for this reason I would suggest that one-quarter of this staff be engaged on one year contracts only under guarantee of H.M.G. I cannot foresee any likelihood of being able to dis pense with the remaining thirty Officers of the Inspecting Staff while our responsibilities under the mandate continue. In order therefore to attract the best type of Officers for such service I consider it essential to offer at least five year contracts under the same guarantees as suggested in the case of Advisers. About one-third of the officers in question are likely to he officers of no regular Government service and therefore without prospects. In their case it is particularly urgent that H.M.G. should guarantee their contracts and offer generous compensation in the event of untimely termination Hereof. Those belonging to Government services could be seconded as suggested fm Advisers. Fifthly .—The question of pensions require consideration. Officers of existing Government services would presumably remain entitled fo the pen sions attached to those services on the understanding that the Mesopotamlan- Government would contribute thereto in respect of the period of their seivice in this country. In the case of other officers pensions payable by the Meso potamian government and guaranteed by H.M.G. and calculated on the basis of the number of years service in this country would have to he offered, fhe actual basis of calculation could he worked out later. Lastly.—I beg that, in the interests of this administration and of the . fticers concerned, H.M.G, may he pleased to give this matter their urgent and favourable consideration and to reply at their earliest convenience. Tliese proposals only concern the central advisory organisation. The question of technical and other departments which will form branches of the actual ad ministration of the State requires separate consideration and will be dealt with piecemeal in due course in consultation with the National GovernmenT Such Departments are Police, Works, Education, Medical, etc. COX.
