The Government of India’s gene ral policy regarding man-power is ekplained in a Press communique, which points out that the question relates not only to supplying purely military requirements, but also to securing the maintenance of all in dustries necessary for the defence of India, the needs of the people and ! the prosecution of the war. \ “it is probable,” says the com 'vnunique, “that the majority of the public now realise that in modern war success depends almost as . much on the normal functioning of in dustry as on purely military mea sures in the stricter sense of the word; and it is, therefore, essential to ensure that every man in the country is used to the best possible advantage. It will also be appreciat ed that what is required is a steady flow of man-power Into the .right channels, with a minimum of dis location of ordinary life. “An Ordinance has already been issued relating to the registration of European British subjects. It is obvious that a beginning had to be made with this community owing to its limited size and to the fact that parallel obligations have already been imposed upon its members in the United Kingdom. The question of the larger communities will be dealt with as necessity arises, for the struggle is the concern of all VOLUNTARY REGISTERS “The Government of India wish to acknowledge with grateful thanks the great assistance which they are receiving in this connection -from the voluntary emergency register ' prepared by the European Associa tion, in India. They also appreciate the. willingness of members of the 4pglo-Indian and Domiciled Euro- • pc an community and other commu- to enrol themselves in a simi- ff^iar register. These voluntary regis- ters are of the utmost value to the T Government of India in compiling the central register unfler Ordinance H., and it has already been possible ff' for the European Association to supply names from their registers y- i n response to the immediate re- ' quirements of local si$fcoritie$. The ir official central- registeriutfn4er the; w Ordinance will utilise;*to' the- full these voluntary registers. “At the same time it tyiDt be real ised that those who have registered in a voluntary register ate in no way relieved from their liability tp enter their names and particulars in the compulsory register prepared under Ordinance IL un&lt; Ru pis hoi dr&lt; ch; et Tt th ini of Si at ju fe m w Rl PFFERS TJF SEK V ICE - No Dislocation Industry: v 'Q' “The Government of India are re ceiving hourly offenr bf service from members of all communities. They Warmly appreciate the spirit S Which these offers are made, but would explain that the time for edif* sideling or tpr dealing with them has not yet come. Schemes for the allocation of national service to members of the larger communities are under consideration and will be promulgated as the necess ity arises . '■Members of the public, MHSSnkt, are requested not to abandon at present their ordinary pursuits in order to volunteer for service in India or elsewhere. The dislocation of industry which might result from such action on a large scale would far outweigh any advantage. Em ployers are asked to endeavour to dissuade persons in key positions in important industries from leaving their posts and to report to Uje De fence Co-ordination Department cases where they have failed to pre vent such action. Should the number of such cases assume any consider able proportion, it might be neces sary for Government to take ap propriate powers, but it is hoped that this appeal to the public will be sufficient. EUROPEAN COMMUNITY “As far as the European com munity is concerned, its members have registered or are registering themselves under Ordinance II or have registered themselves in the emergency register prepared by the European Association. They may well ask, ‘What Is the next step’. The Government of India v/ould like to assure them that their various roles in the task of natio nal defence will be allotted to them in due course. In the meantime,’ they should wait until they have received a communication either from the Central or local authori ties or from the authorities at the Centre. Calls on their service will be made as specific needs become apparent. Pending these; they are i!™.sked to carry on .—Associated Reserve of Officers SIMLA, September 6. In accordance with standing in structions issued by the War Office, officers of the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Territorial Army Reserve of the British Army, domicil ed in India, unless they have receiv ed special orders to the contrary direct from the War Office, are re quired to report to the military. au thorities in India.

Mr. Waller 1 s salary was paid up to and including November 30th, 1939* It rather looks as though, for some reason not apparent, Mr. Waller had determined to serve the Forceb rathor than to remain in this Company 1 s service at Bahrein. We have no guide to the reason for such a preference. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H. R. Ballantyne. .P. Gibson, Esq., jadia Office, nitehall, S. W. 1.97 / 39 . INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.

It is a rather disappointing sequel to our securing his release from E.A.F.service in September at your request, but, as you say, it seems as if he was determined to leave Bahrain and I imagine there was nothing further that we could have done in the matter.

I agree with you it is a rather disappointing sequel to Waller’s release from service, and I certainly think that there is nothing further that you could have^ done in the matter. You will recall that another man named Cotsall was released by the Admiralty to return to work for the Company., Subsequently, however, Cotsell persisted in the view that he could be of much more use serving with H.M. Poreas than with the Company. Arrangements were made to replace him- and Cotsell accordingly left the Company's service. - Black, the other man released at the same time as Cotsell, is back with the Company at Bahrein, and apparently content to remain there. * Last Friday, Mr-. Thornburg told Mr. Peel that the Company is adding another half dozen highly trained Operatives of U.S. American nationality to the Staff at Bahrein, in order to minimise the risk of the Refinery closing down, should the British Employees in Bahrein be called upon to serve with H.M.

The Hon’hle His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein Island, Persian Culf. Dear Sir, With reference to my letter dated the 18th March 1940, regarding A.R.P. measures in Bahrein forwarded by the Company's Personnel Manager to your goodself, I take this opportunity to invite your personal attention to the fact that with the recent developments, Bahrein which might have been considered in the past as being immune from an air attack no longer appears so. Under the circumstances the only defence which is open to civil population is passive defence i.e. precautions and pre parations, designed to give the enemey as vague and uncertain a target as possible and to minimise the effects on any bombs that may be dropped. These preparations must be made and practised in time of peace and cannot be hurriedly improvised at the spur of the moment. In the interest of the civilian population in Bahrein, I think there is the immediate necessity of practising 'Black out' on a certain date throughout the Island specially at the Awali and Refinery and the effect to be watched by Civil and Military Air Craft. If the Local Government feels interested in this, I can submit a comprehensive scheme for practising 'Black out' and the preliminary as measures regarding restrictions for the street and exterior lighting, vehicle and interior lights. Further, with the permission of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, of which I am an employee, apart from my ordinary duties I beg to offer my services as an Honorary Air Warden or in any other capacity that I may be considered fit for.

I (ft op A / v j- | X thlnlf X should report the background to my telegrams ✓ Nos. 182 and 183 of the 18th JUne since it may seem that X have been rather precipitous la my action. 2. Though X am sore that you can appreciate the feelings of Britishers in Bahrain as a result of the recent news from Burope t X am not quite so convinced that the reactions of overseas Britons are fully appreciated at Home. The pallia tives applied last September and the stream of propaganda that has been put out since about the success of the economic war and the inevitable victory of the Allies can no longer satisfy people who have hoard, in the dismal accents of the B.B.C. announcers, that France has fallen, that our Air Force is still vastly inferior in numbers to the enemy's, that the Hun has been able to put into the field an overwhelmingly superior force of tanks and other mechanised vehicles, that Britain cannot even provide rifles yet for If million men and that only in the last few days have the arsenals and munitions factories started to work on a war schedule. The bitterness and excitement which this news has caused are difficult to exaggerate. Men who remained at their tasks here at the request of Kis Uarthsty's Government last September remember t hat they have helped to produce and refine oil some of which had gone to Italian possessions and practically none ef which, so far as they know, has yet been bought by Hie Majesty's Government. It was therefore only to be expected that a very awkward situation would arise. They began to L * 1 talk about resigning, to demand to come to see me with a view to /- le Lieut-Colonel 3. Prior. C.X.JS*! i Political ^isident in the Persian Gulf. Buahira.. 2 • to getting away; some of them even pat in their resignations; end the old talk of the wrongness of able-bodied Britishers working to increase the profits of an American concern began to revive* The news of the formation of a Volunteer Defence Force did not satisfy them. They did not want to w play at soldiers”, they wanted to go and fight* 3* From the experience of last September when a very different military situation existed, 1 apprehended that unless some action were taken quickly we should find it difficult to prevent a wholesale exodus involving very serious dislocation of oil production here* I therefore got in touch with Thornburg and Black and asked that they should begin a preliminary examination of all possible methods of releasing men who might be required for active service, without in any way curtailing operations designed to maintain output and refining at fullc opacity. They got down to it at once following certain suggestions which I made for simplifi cation and cancellation of long leave* By these means, and by increasing working hours and taking in some Americans from the Mainland they can at need release about 100 men of varying ages within a comparatively short time* is, of course, recognised that continuous long hours here are not .feasible and a certain number of men must ultimately be brought in from America in order to reduce working hours to a more appropriate periodj This was on Monday night. On Tuesday morning I received an urgent request from the British employees of the Company to go and talk to them and Z did talk to them last night. Z think every man off duty was there. In effect Z said that His Majesty's Government were examining the problem of mobilisation of British man-power overseas and that in preparation for demands which might come the Company were irgently considering what releases could be effected* I reminded A- 3 - reminded then that an oil field and refinery euoh as we have in Bahrain are worth a division of troops any time and I said that His Majesty's Government were most insistent that nothing should he done which might result in a diminished output* I told them that it might he possible to let Some of them go provided that the whole scheme was worked out in a thoroughly business-like and disciplined manner. (1 gave no Indication . of the probable number). This would mean that to allow some men 1 to go others must definitely be prepared to stay hare, to work longer hours, to expect no long leave and in general to obey orders just as much as if they were members of the fight- p#: ■ v; w . ing forces themselves. They must accept decisions as to who could or could not be spared, and if any did go they must go where they ware sent and not where they themselves wanted to go. Meanwhile X told them to join the Volunteer Defence Force where, even if they did not have uniforms and equipment at once, they could at least learn discipline and the rudiments of a soldier’s training. This address was received very well, and I think it will serve to keep thS men quiet for a time. But it must be appreciated that its effect will not last long. Directly I receive a reply from you to ray telegram asking whether volunteers are to go to 5!gypt or elsewhere it is essential to send off a small 'token detachment'. This first detachment can be released by pure simplification of office and operational procedure. For the rest I repeat my recommenda tion that a Compulsory 9ervic|» Act^ bd applied here. I have explained in my telegram No* 182 why volunteering will not work. The keenest volunteer is often a key nan who simply cannot be spared and he is liable to resent the release of another volunteer in a less important position. Xf we have compulsory service, that includes compulsory service in any undertaking producing vital war materials, and it will enable us /&lt;1 ^— as not only to ensure that the Oil Company continues to work at fall pressure bat also that a very useful number of British- ers f many of them with technical qualifications which should be of immense value either in the Air Force or in other Mechanised Forces, are sent for service. Meanwhile there are about 30 British employees of the Company on leave in England (we do not know the exact number as we do not know how many, if any, have already been enabled to leave England to return here)* The Company have telegraphed to their London Office saying that if these men are of use for national ser vice they need not return here as it is possible to arrange to carry on without them. 4. Finally, since there can now be little doubt that every man in the Empire is needed, ought we not to encourage the Company to arrange for the progressive replacement of almost all able-bodied British employees here by Americans ? It is pertinent to note that all those Britishers who do go now will be assured of re-employment after the war, if they survive. I may add that there is equal enthusiasm in Manaaa itself among the British population. Some of us recognise sorrowfully that we have no chance but others are already Yours sincerely, lUlsL* applying to go.Telegram From To Repeated No. India Office, London. Political Resident, Bushire.

It is not even worth while keeping them in order to enlarge Local Volunteer Defence Force since we shall have more than enough to deal with any local disturbance and can in no circumstances cope with sea or air attack on any scale in absence of adequate weapons. 3. Company are far more ready to aid now in arranging release of British employees than they were last September. Unless we take advantage of this attitude and work on controlled plan I foresee grave difficulties ahead since men will resign (without notice) in increasing numbers. | This is very serious risk since men have been^greatly affected by recent^broadcasts indicating (a) that British Industrial War Effort hitherto has been inadequate and ) ' i / (b) that England is in imminent danger of invasion. Many object to working in American Company of whose products^ i [ f / §Si His Majesty's Government^have so far taken^microscopic fraction compared with Italy. To obtain maximum results \ i I &gt; ' ' we require powers to decide (in consultation with Company) some how many pan go ^and how many pnust be^kept^here under form of industrial conscription. Speed is desirable since in next few weeksseveral replacements can be made from i / L ) California Arabian Standard Oil Company.2 4.

To, H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrein. Sir, During the last Great War of 1914, I have rendered services as a special recruiter and was detailed to work with Major Bomes, The Divisional Recruiting Officer camped at Bhatgate, Lahore. My disc, number was 673. Until 1919, I recruited a considerable number of men and then went to Hong Kong with Eisari Regiment. I served in Tieshan with 1st Loyal Regiment and at Madras with Lancashire Fusilier Regiment in the capacity of a tailor. I am now at Bahrein working as a Tailor Master. Being a loyal supporter of the British Crown and its constitution, I take it to be my duty to volunteer my services for the benefit of our King &amp; Country. I shall therefore be glad to know if you wish to avail my services either as a recruiter, or Military tailor. I may mentioned that I am placing myself at your disposal and can join immediately at any time. Furthermore, I am pleased to inform you that two of my brother's sons are also serving in the present war. I beg to remain, Sir, your Most Obedient Servant, SYED SHER SHAH.No. C/538-12/19 Politics.!

Yours faithfully, ■ - L Political Agent, Bahrain.I- June 20, 1940. H.B.M’s Political Agent, BAH REIN. We, some of the loyal Indians in Bahrein, would like to ganize an Indian Volunteer Corps (I.V.C.) by way of contributing • might towards the Empire’s effort in putting an end to this ;hless war. It is our idea that 1. This corps shall consist of loyal Indians between the ages of 20 and 45 resident in Bahrein. Many are the mg Indians that are in the employ of the various firms and jewhere in Bahrein and an organization of such a unit would go rreat way in helping the cause of the Allies in enabling as jh of the regulars to be released to the front. 2. This shall be on the lines of the Territorial Force. Without prejudice to the interests of the concerns jrein we are working, we will be available for duty. But a bit training would enable us to be of immense help to look to the )al safety; i.e. safety of the local offices and concerns against .ferage, sabotage and the like. 3. This corps shall work in conjunction with the local defence and under instructions and guidance from your •dself. If this be organized well, many are the uses it could be i to. It is thought that the Unit would easily muster a hundred •ong what with the willingness several have expressed. May be it there are several others too willing to volunteer. Should this scheme meet with your approval, kindly favour with an interview so that furtherance of the scheme could be 'ected without any loss of time. I would, in this connection luest you to fix up the time for interview sometime after 5 P.M. week days or at any time on Friday.

I understand that it is not at present desired to encourage volunteers from overseas to come to United King dom for military service. Having regard to potential im portance of Bahrain oil we feel that these men are doing useful work by remaining in their present employment. In so far however as any who wish to leave can be spared it would seem preferable that instead of making the difficult journey to United Kingdom they should go to India if they can be usefully employed there e.g. in munitions work. Would Government of India welcome offers of service from such men in connection with munitions or even military expansion programme ? / Retaxandum -Telegram ’'S” \0 From Political Agent, Bahrain.

I cannot disguise fact that prospect of voluntary service military or otherwise still further east in India will content very few men. 3. Men have known for months that considerable numbers could be released without damage to oil output by methods indicated in my reports. While war was static they felt no great concern but common anxiety now is to get Home and do something in England to help against forthcoming invasion advertised in backs-to-wall style by B.B.C. 4. Short of taking effective legal powers the only practical method of keeping men content in their jobs is for His Majesty’s Government to declare openly that fighting services in England are full and have no use for them and that there is no opening for skilled men from overseas in *ar industries at Home. 5.

Hnds H • nn Britconsuli TALK BY M. W. THORNBURG TO BAP CO EMPLOYEES - 14th JULY 1940. -Hj 1 3- It has been suggested that:I make some appropriate itements concerning the Company’s attitude toward, and mentions concerning, certain matters of current importance. I have said that I would, and I am here now for that ?pose. Until now I have, in the main, kept away from current sstions that were not strictly Company matters - feeling that Litary matters should be handled by the military - British tters by the British - Community matters by the Community, c; leaving Company matters to be handled by the Company - t it has become apparent that - at a point - all these matters velop common aspects, and it is only proper that Company ployees should know along what lines Company policy is formings At such times rumors and misunderstandings are iundant. To avoid further confusion arising out of what I i going to say to-night, I shall follow closely these notes lich I have written, and a written report of what I say will &gt; available for those who are not present - and for review by lose who are The present. matters which I / shall discuss/are First: Company attitude toward British subjects leaving Bahrein for active service. Second: Local Defense and the Local Volunteer Defense Corps. Third: Contributions of money to meet needs arising but of the war. Finally: I shall be glad to discuss any other subject which can be discussed appropriately before this gathering, or answer any questions that I can answer which are relevant to these discussions. I will say too that I shall be available to any individual or group for the same purpose.Page £. First, with respect to British subjects leaving Bahrein for active service, I shall outline briefly the background against which Company policy must be viewed. We operate here under a concession from the Bahrein Government which, by virtue of certain treaty relationship between that Government and involves a number of obligations on the part of the Company toward H.M.G. Some of these become operative when a state of war exists. These are now in operation. Under them we are com mitted to a programme of uninterrupted full-capacity operation with the primary purpose - to which all private Company interests are subordinate - of supplying essential products for essential war purposes - as directed by appropriate offices of H.M.G. I repeat that this obligation is now upon us, and - if I need to say it - I will add that it is accepted at its full face value by the Company, and no other consideration takes priority over it. To maintain uninterrupted full-capacity operation demands that we maintain a certain force of men. We have been told that H.M.G. considers these operations of great importance, and that it is not desired by H.M.G. that they be hampered by Britishers leaving for active service until they are cailed*■ j^i'WS-jhave been told that, if men are called from here, we could indicate individuals who were — in a practical sense - essential to continued operation and that - if possible - such individuals would be released from other duties to remain here. We have asked that a formal order be issued relieving the individual men here from the necessity of making their separate decisions as to joining up, by establishing them as on essential duty here until they are released individually as arrangements could be made to protect essential operations. This was to insure against a sudden decimation of our force I without allowing opportunity for replacement or re-organization.Page 3. No such order has been forthcoming. We have informed H.M.G., officially, that we have .bout 30 men on leave in England and about to return to Bahrein, torn we do not need for operation under emergency conditions, nd who are therefore available for other services at home or Isewhere. We have the reply that it is H.M.G.»s wish for these en to return to Bahrein. They are now on their way here. We have analyzed - or are analyzing - every operation prformed here with the aim of determining its importance under resent or certain future conditions - and planning as best we !«n, by eliminating, combining or modifying essential operations 1- insure that they can be/performed with minimum, personnel. We ive prepared plans for raoajgajMH&amp;ieg/hours of work for the same irpose. we have worked out plans for replacing individual men io are subject to call, under normal procedure, with other dividual men who are less likely to be called, or with such ericans as are available. We have arranged for a small group of trained operators km America to come to Bahrein as a reserve against sudden need, iy will be here shortly. We have arranged for a larger group , be selected at home and held in readiness to leave immediately call for them. All these American operators are for emergency Ly, and not t© ^displace - but only to replace British operators I are called away. We have arranged to secure, on short notice - the ■lest possible support from Casoc, to tide us over any emergency it may face us. No British employee should entertain the idea that se arrangements for replacements of British by American loyees indicate anything but one aspect of our program for ntaining these operations on a full-capacity basis regardless what happens. If you do not know it, I shall tell you that our cession Agreement requires that we use British subjects totie greatest possible extent consistent with security and fficiency. Consequently, by making temporary substitutions f Americans for British operators, we impose upon ourselves tie further necessity of getting other Britishers when this ecomes possible, training them and releasing the Americans s rapidly as this can be done. To suppose that the Company would voluntarily under ake such a program, except as a means of meeting a vital scessity, is absurd. Some months ago John Black was called to active srvice. Since at that time our situation in respect of srsonnel was in even a worse state of uncertainty than it is »w, we acted upon advice we had received from H.M.G. and squested his return to Bahrein. He was returned and has iken an invaluable part in our preparations for dealing with lat may come. A few days ago he was again called. This time he is the only one of our three Managers here, both Reith and Lpp being in America. However, our answer was 'More power ) you, Lieut. Commander Black, and God bless you'. As far as its own interests are concerned, the Company is only this same word for each one of you. As an important, if not essential, unit in Imperial sfense, however, other interests must be consulted. Here, 5 may say that some of you can be spared now, more as soon as •W i 0 ^utZu**ir’ iztu* tLU'ttU-t ljustments can be made, and finally a 11^ jf-noVnl ha. But on lis, we defer to H.M.G.'s wishes or instructions The next point I shall deal with in fewer words. As for our local defenses we have had plans under svelopment for a considerable time. These plans have not Jen initiated nor directed by the Company - except as to jtail. Our Company’s commercial interests do not, in our )inion, warrant any extensive or elaborate plan of defense atBahrein. Our market is worldwide, and so are the sources of our oil. However, we have dene here what appeared to be warranted on other ground from time to time, and intend to continue to do so. Recently a program has been put forward to form a I Local Volunteer Defense Corps. This unit is not provided I for the purpose of defending any private interests of this I Company. I repeat that our private interests do not appear to us to ^tate^any active part as our own. Our broader I interests^ however, impel us to give it every possible support. It is not for me to define its function nor describe fits process of organization, beyond what I have said. Whether ' its P ur Pose is to guard against local disturbances, to protect against invasion or to provide preliminary training for those ( who may later b « called to training centers is not a direct concern of the Companys. As an officially sponsored program of H.M.G.^however, it must be clear to all that this Company will give it full support. My next - and last - topic is the matter of raising i funds in this community to meet needs arising out of the war. What I say here is not a matter of Company policy. Part of my reason for discussing it is that I wish it made clear that it is not a Company directed program. My own part in it came about as naturally and accidentally as in the case of each of the dozen or so in the group who discussed it a day or two ago. This group grew to 30 or 40, all apparently of the mind that our community should adopt an immediate and effective program which would insure a regular and considerable contribution toward needs of various sorts arising out of the war. The plan has been outlined in writing and the outline distributed to European residents throughout Awali and Manama.Page 6 . hare been asked t© direct attention to the plan and to the .ct | which I think can scarcely be questioned 1 that it will finish the best means of securing promptly and regularly from .ch member of the community the only contribution which we here n make, which is m*ney. There are many others here who can discuss all phases I this plan, although it would appear to require little «oussion. The only observation which I make personally, and mply as one of the Community, is that under the stress of ie uncertainties which confront all of us these days, it is .sy | too easy - t© confound trivialities with grim actualities, irely this is a time when we must each of us wipe out from ir own minds the 'fifth column' of dissension and hyper-sensitive •iticism, and deal with tides real. needSaasis**!'others directly id sslidly.I Telegram From To Repeated No. 'S'.

I should hope that it would suffice to reaffirm that in national interests men in key positions should remain but if not I will consider the matter further.

Probably only New York office could extricate accounts of each and advise exact pro portions of Bahrain Company's transactions in different currencies. I gather however that Bahrain Petrolem Com pany's sales transactions are normally in currency of country to which oil is'shipped. Germany and Italy were exceptions before war; and Japan still is, American dollars being demanded in the^e cases. 3. In India for instance Company's rupee£ sales serve to finance Indian Oil Concessions as well as providing rupee currency required here by both Bahrain Petroleum Company apd California Arabian Standard Oil Company. 4. With exception of Australia which has entirely separate currency control I believe surplus receipts in Empire countries go to London where Company apply for dollar exchange.

We operate here under a concession from the Bahrein jvernment which, by virtue of certain treaty relationship stween that Government and H.M.G., involves a number of ^ligations on the part of the Company toward H.M.G. Some of these become operative when a state of war cists. These are now in operation. Under them we are com- Ltted to a programme of uninterrupted full-capacity operation Lth the primary purpose - to which all private Company interests re subordinate - of supplying essential products for essential ar purposes - as directed by appropriate offices of H.M.G. I repeat that this obligation is now upon us, and - f I need to say it - I will add that it is accepted at its all face value by the Company, and no other consideration takes riority over it. To maintain uninterrupted full-capacity operation gmands that we maintain a certain force of men. We have been told that H.M.G. considers these perations of great importance, and that it is not desired y H.M.G. that they be hampered by Britishers leaving for ctive service until they are called, j' - We-have been told that, f men are called from here, we could indicate individuals who ere - in a practical sense - essential to continued operation nd that - if possible - such individuals would.be released rom other duties to remain here. We have asked that a formal order be issued relieving he individual men here from the necessity of making their ep'arate decisions as to joining up, by establishing them as on ssential duty here until they are released individually as .rrangements could be made to protect essential operations. 'his was to insure against a sudden decimation of our force rithout allowing opportunity for replacement or re-organization.No such order has been forthcoming. We have informed H.M.G., officially, that we have it 30 men on leave in England and about to return to Bahrein, i we do not need for operation under emergency conditions, who are therefore available for other services at home or swhere. We have the reply that it is H.M.G.’s wish for these to return to Bahrein. They are now on their way here. We have analyzed - or are analyzing - every operation formed here with the aim of determining its importance under sent or certain future conditions - and planning as best we 4 by eliminating, combining or modifying essential operations insure that they can be performed with minimum personnel. We •e prepared plans for reorganizing hours of work for the same •pose. We have worked out plans for replacing individual men &gt; are subject to call, under normal procedure, with other lividual men who are less likely to be called, or with such sricans as are available. We have arranged for a small group of trained operators om America to come to Bahrein as a reserve against sudden need, ey will be here shortly. We have arranged for a larger group be selected at home and held in readiness to leave immediately i call for them. All these American operators are for emergency ily, and not to displace - but only to replace British operators 10 are called away. We have arranged to secure, on short notice - the xLlest possible support from Casoc, to tide us over any emergency hat may face us. No British employee should entertain the idea that hese arrangements for replacements of British by American mployees indicate anything but one aspect of our program for laintaining these operations on a full-capacity basis regardless if what happens. If you do not know it, I shall tell you that our Concession Agreement requires tnat we use British subjects toe greatest possible extent consistent with security and ficiency. Consequently, by making temporary substitutions [Americans for British operators, we impose upon ourselves e further necessity of getting other Britishers when this comes possible, training them and releasing the Americans I rapidly as.this can be done. To suppose that the Coippany would voluntarily under- ke such a program, except as a means of meeting a vital cessity, is absurd. Some months ago John Black was called to active rvice. Since at that time our situation in respect of rsonnel was in even a worse state of uncertainty then it is ,w , w© acted upon advice we had received from H.M.G. and iquested his return to Bahrein. He was returned and has iken an invaluable part in our preparations for dealing with tat may come. A few days ago he was again called. This time he is the only one of our three Managers here, both Reith and Lpp being in America. However, our answer was 'More power ) you, Lieut. Commander Black, and God bless you”. As far as its own interests are concerned, the Company is only this same word for each one of you. As an important, if not essential, unit in Imperial jfense, however, other interests must be consulted. Here, 3 may say that some of you can be spared now, more as soon as ljustments can be made, and finally all if need be. But on ttis , we defer to H.M.G.’s wishes or instructions The next point I shall deal with in fewer words. As for our local defenses we have had plans under evelopment for a considerable time. These plans have not een initiated nor directed by the Company - except as to etail. Our Company's commercial interests do not, in our pinion, warrant any extensive or elaborate plan of defense at/ Page 5. jahrein. Our market is worldwide, and so are the sources if our oil. However, we have done here what appeared to e warranted on other ground from time to time, and intend o continue to do so. Recently a program has been put forward to form a ,ocal Volunteer Defense Corps. This unit is not provided or the purpose of defending any private interests of this lompany. I repeat that our private interests do not appear o us to dictate any active part as our own. Our broader nterests, however, impel us to give it every possible support. It is not for me to define its function nor describe ts process of organization, beyond what I have said. Whether ts purpose is to guard against local disturbances, to protect gainst invasion or to provide preliminary training for those 110 may later be called to training centers is not a direct nncern of the companys. As an officially sponsored program If h.M.G. however, it must be clear to all that this Company 111 give it full support. My next - and last - topic is the matter of raising funds in this community to meet needs arising out of the war. What I say here is not a matter of Company policy. ’art of my reason for discussing it is that I wish it made clear ;hat it is not a Company directed program. My own part in it came about as naturally and incidentally as in the case of each of the dozen or so in the ;roup who discussed it a day or two ago. This group grew to 50 or 40, all apparently of the mind that our community should idopt an immediate and effective program which would insure a regular and considerable contribution toward needs of variou sorts arising out of the war. The plan has been outlined in writing and the outline listributed to European residents throughout Awali and ManPage 6 . ■ ; have been asked to direct attention to the plan and to the 'act - which I think can scarcely be questioned - that it will urnish the best means of securing promptly and regularly from ach member pf the community the only contribution which we here an make, which is money. There are many others here who can discuss all phases f this plan, although it would appear to require little iscussion. The only observation which I make personally, and imply as one of the Community, is that under the stress of he uncertainties which confront all of us these days, it is asy - too easy - to confound trivialities with grim actualities, urely this is a time when we must each of us wipe out from ur own minds the 'fifth column' of dissension and hyper-sensitive riticism, and deal with this real need and all others directly ad solidly.

I do not think we need worry unduly about men whose contracts expire and refuse re-engagement. Company hatee their arrangements made at all times for replacement of time-expiring men who are not likely to re-engage and such expiries do not come in unweildy batches. (In wartime Company have to look more to Colonies and America than to London for replacements). Men who refuse to re-engage could therefore be given their exit permits (and would presumably be picked up in India or United Kingdom for compulsory service). Real value of exit permit system ±e to prevent whole sale premature departures. 3. I have complete draft Notice ready based on latest instructions and information from London and India which lays strongest stress on His Laiestu's Government's requirement that key men must stay and which defines key position as one 'requiring special knowledge or qualifications for which substitute cannot readily be found'.

NOTICE Volunteering^by Britons living Overseas for service in the Armed Forces The Political Agent has received the following instructions from His Majesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom, 2. His Majesty 1 s Government have now decided that, subject to the conditions set out below, British subjects living overseas who desire to volunteer for service in the Armed Forces should be given encouragement. At the same time His Majesty’s Government desire to impress on all concerned the importance of maintaining at t heir utmost efficiency all British commercial and financial concerns abroad and they therefore state that volunteers who occu py key positions in British concerns may not be accepted. His Majesty’s Government further state that in view of the importance of Bahrain oil they are concerned to ensure that there shall' be no diminution or interruption of the output of petroleum products from these Islands. His Majesty’s Government hold that employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company are engaged in work of national value and they reaffirm that men in key positions serve their country best by staying in their present jobsf consequently the above qualification prohibiting acceptance of volunteers in key positions will apply equally to them. In view of the above it devolves on the Political Agent, Bahrain, to exercise the responsibility of deciding, in consultation with the responsible heads of companies or firms 5 in^Bahrain, whether or not any volunteer is occupying a key position (which may be defined as a post requiring special knowledge or qualifications for which a substitute cannot readily be found). 3. His Majesty’s Government have pointed out that in so far as any British subjects who wish to join the Armed Forces can be spared it is preferable that insuead^of^ making the long and difficult journey to the United King- | &lt;3om they should join the Forces in India. The Government ' of India have stated that they would welcome offers of servicea and desire information about the qualifications and ages of any volunteers who can be spared. They further add that men are particularly required for the Corps of Engineers and as Ordnance Mechanical Engineers. the age limit for the latter being from 25 to 50. In addition they would welcome men between the ages of 19 and 35 who would be suitable for Commissions in the Indian Army pro vided they are passed medically fit for general service in any theatre of operations. 4. It is recognised that there may be some volunteers to whom the prospect of service In India is distasteful and in such cases the Political Agent has instructions to telegraph their applications to the Umbed Kingdom, though it /-4 lb' it must be understood that His Majesty’s Government mayfdecide, if only for transport reasons, that openings for suitable applicants should be found in th$ Middle East Military or Air Forces rather than in the United Kingdom® Attached to this Notice are statements showing the categories in which volunteers are required for the Royal Navy, the Army and the Air Force* 5® Applications from volunteers may now be sent to the Agency giving all necessary particulars, enclosing a medical certificate of fitness for general service, and stating whether the applicant is prepared to join the Forces in India, Volunteers will thereafter be in formed whether they can be spared for service in the Armed Forces in the near or distant future or not at all, and in view of the statement of His Majesty’s Government’s policy defined in the second paragraph of this Notice, such decisions must be accepted as binding® It should be observed that a decision one way or the other conveys no reflection whatsoever on the merit or ability of the volunteer concerned, whether or as a potential combatant® .8 present occupation 6 . The Political Agent further notifies all concerned that the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, acting on the instructions of His Majesty’s Govern ment, has issued a Regulation, having effect from the 29th July 1940, prohibiting the departure from Bahrain of any male European British subject unless he is in possession of an Exit Permit signed by the Political Agent® / / • } , !/\j - , HoBoM 3 s Political Agent, Bahrain®in which volturbeei-s are rsquired.

Dear Sir, f In reply to your memorandum No: C/643-12-19 of 6 th August, 1940, about the application of Mr. R. S. Day to join the Royal Air Force. Mr. Day will not amend his letter. He admits that his real desire is to go to England and that he is so anxious to get there that he would rather enlist - on his own terms - than remain in the East. The Company is able to spare the services of Mr. Day. ’ You will probably be inclined to refuse his application, but I submit that under Para 4 of the Notice of S 7 th July, 1940, his application ought to be sent to the United Kingdom. If His Majesty’s Government do not need his services in the United Kingdom I suggest that, because he does not want to serve in the East, he ceases to be a ’suitable applicant' so the question of his joining the R.A.F. in the East will not arise.

M's Political Ageat, Dear Sir, Clarification is sought of the Political Agent's Notice about volunteering for service in the Aroed Forces. 1. Th® first part of Para 3 suggests that volunteers «boald join the Forces in India. Para 4 states that even if the P.A. telegraphs explications to join in the United Kingdom, His Majesty's Government nay decide that openings for volunteers should be found in the Middle East. ds' Under the heading ARMY, sub-sections (d)(e)(f)(g) and (h) seem to assume that all volunteers for the Army will be sent to the United Kingdom. There appears to be some contradiction here and it is not clear whether volunteers who possess the qualifications listed under ARMY, sub sections (a) and (b) will invariably be sent to the U.K. for enlistment. 2. The second part of Para 3 states that the Government of India would welcome offers of services and that they desire information about the qualifications of volunteers. This does not seem to square with sub-sections (a) and (b), under the heading ARMY, where specific qualifications are layed down. Unless these the te qualifications apply only to those volunteers who are to be U.K. for enlistment f sent to May it be assumed that the Government of India will accept volun teers who do not possess any of the qualifications listed under ARMY, sub sections (a) and (b) ? 3.

His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent BAHREIN. ’ Dear Sir, In reply to your letter C/719-12/19 of September 16, 1940 aDout Mr. Chandler. Mr. Chandler is right in saying that it is 'because Mr. Barrett will not return for another contract that the Company is now unahle to release him (Chandler). But he is wrong in saying that Mr. Barrett never intended to re-engage. Mr. Barrett did say he would come 'back, 'but now he feels he must go to his home in Rng i anfl for a time. He will only re-engage with the Company if we will send him to England and 'bring him out again. Because of the long delays esperienced in getting our employees out of England we are instructed not to send men home on leave; and if a man insists on going home we may not re-contract him. As you will readily realise, many of our men are anxious to spend at least some of their long leave in England, and we are trying to produce a scheme to permit them to do this. The present idea is to send long leave men to South Africa with instructions to start on their way hack 'by a given date. 'What they do between arrival and departure is their own responsibility and some may decide to make a short visit to England. If s uch a scheme comes into force it may appeal to Mr. Barrett and he may again be willing tof CON-632. - 2 - I 7fi 21 st September, 1940 1, a ga in in OTO ^ 16 matter 0f Vr ' MaKee ’ ,tr - Ohaniler is , McKee was not an ordinary Eefinerv chpmi =&gt;+ and was far too brilliant and highly Sid to h^nSt S^ WiM ^iSi ? for n such t a G pSIt aP Ss e Sont^ at t MS p ® rsonalit y unsuitable ror sucn a post, his contract was terminated. tit ir^v , Th ® 0om Pany is now searching for a man to take Ir.

His age is 29; he is certified medically fit; he is a bachelor of science in engineering (LOndon), an Associate Member of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, and an Associate of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. 2.

In view of his technical qualifications, it seems a pity not to avail ourselves of this offer; and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, through whom I am sending this letter, has said in the course of a telephone conversation that he thinks you would be able to make use of his services either afloat or in a technical job ashore. 4.

IgjHMll lI Britons living for_.s_ervice in the. Armed Forces—™'~ •ed v* +^+ S esty 1 s Government have now decided that subject to the conditions set out below, British subilcts Ai V ^5®T? 0Versea v W ^ 0 ^ es ^- re volunteer for service in the Armed Forces should be given.encouragement. At the same time His Majesty’s Government desire to impress on all concerned the importance of maintaining at their utmost S 1 B fv tls 5 comaier, cial and financial concerns abroad and they therefore state that volunteers who occu rs .Positions in British concerns may not be accepted. His Majesty’s Government further state that in view of +!? e + : ^P ortan ? e Ba * ira i' n - oil they are concerned to ensure that there shall be no diminution or interruption of the output of petroleum products from these Islands. His Majesty’s Government hold that employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company are engaged in work of national value and they reaffirm that men in key positions serve their country best by staying in their present jobs; consequently the above qualification prohibiting acceptance of volunteers in key positions will apply equally to them. In view of the above it devolves on the Political Agent, Bahrain, to exercise the responsibility of deciding, in consultation with the responsible heads of companies or firms in Bahrain, whether or not any volunteer is occupying a key position (which may be defined as a post requiring special knowledge or qualifications for which a substitute cannot readily be found). 3. His Majesty’s Government have pointed out that ip. so far as any British subjects who wish to join the Armed Forces can be spared it is preferable that instead of making the long and difficult journey to the United King dom they should join the Forces in India. The Government of India have stated that they would welcome offers of service® and desire information about the qualifications and ages of any volunteers who can be spared. They further add that men are particularly required for the Corps of Engineers and as Ordnance Mechanical Engineers, the^age limit for the latter being from 25 to 50. In addition they would welcome men between the ages of 19 and 35 who would be suitable for Commissions in the Indian Army pro vided they are passed medically fit for general service in any theatre of operations. 4. It is recognised that there may be some volunteers to whom the prospect of service in India is distasteful and in such cases the Political Agent has instructions to telegraph their applications to the United Kingdom, though it /-- 2 - mavfeecide 6 if d on^v°? d t + at His Ma J e sty ! s Government f orsnit«hT p f f tran spo^t reasons, that openings S 1 applicants should be found in the Middle KiSadom 1 At+o°J F °?’ ( r es rather than in the United .. ^ , ° . achea to this Notice are statements showing ^ Which volunteers are required for the Royal Navy, the Army and the Air Force» .

Volunteers will thereafter be in formed whether they can be spared for service in the Armed Forces in the near or distant future or not at all, and_in view of the statement of His Majesty’s Government’s policy defined in the sesond paragraph of this Notice, such decisions must be accepted as binding* It should be observed that a decision one way or the other conveys no reflection whatsoever on the merit or ability of the volunteer concerned, whether in his present occupation or as a potential combatant. 6. The Political Agent further notifies all concerned that the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, acting on the instructions of His Majesty's Govern ment, has issued a Regulation, having effect from the 29th July 1940, prohibiting the departure from Bahrain of any male European British subject unless he is in possession of an Exit Permit signed by the Political Agent» H.B.M 3 s Political Agent, Bahrain*^§jjegorie3 i .Ir^jA^ich volnnt.
