COMPILED IN THE DIVISION OF THE CHIEF OF THE STAFF.PREFACE. The following notes, prepared by Captain C. M. Gibbon in the Persian Section of the Intelligence Branch, give in a consolidated form the main facts of the arms trade. It may be remarked that, so far as our information from Afghan istan and tribal territory goes, the importations of modern arms into those areas may betaken as at least 30,000 rifles and 3,000,000 rounds of ammunition annually, and we are aware that so many additional merchants, financed by high authorities, if not by the Afghan Government itself, are now embarking on the trade that in all probability these figures will be largely exceeded in the coming season. Am unsatisfactory feature, of which at present no adequate explanation is forth coming, is the large number of New South Wales and New Zealand Government Martini rifles now being imported into Afghanistan vid Masqat and the Makran coast. Probably these were sold out of the service for a few shillings apiece. Our most recent information shows that they sell at Kabul for Rs. 210, or ^ 14, and as they are in excellent condition they are in strong demand. As showing the enormous profits to be made it may be mentioned that a short Lee-Enfield rifle, costing about £ 6, will sell on the Afghan and tribal border for the equivalent of from ^ 66 to ^ 80. That the arms trade, for some years past a serious matter, is now rapidly assuming an even more menacing complexion is amply proved by all our trans frontier reports during the last few months. Many thousands of modern arms have been disposed of during the past summer in the Kabul bazars, and of these a very large proportion have found their way into the hands of the turbulent and warlike tribes on either side of the Durand line, thus immensely increasing their capacity for mischief. i$th September igo8. W. MALLESON, Lieut enanU Colonel,Correction to tlie pamphlet “THE ILLICIT Tit ALE IN ARMS AND AMMUNITION BETWEEN THE PERSIAN GULP AND AFGHAN ISTAN.^ x / Page 1, paragraph 7, line 3 :—■ For “ 200 ” read “50.’'1. It is not necessary to rewrite the political aspects, and the past history of the Arms Trade in the Persian Gulf. This has been fully and completely discussed by Mr. Lorimer in his memorandum on “ The Arms and Ammuni tion Traffic in_ the Gulfs of Persia and Oman The various Appendices here however deal with the history of the trade in detail during the past two years. 2. The trade during the past three years has increased enormously having nearly quadrupled itself in that time. The Consular Trade Report for Masqat for 1905-06 gives the total value of the arms trade as Rs. 1,074,380 and that of 1907*08 as Rs. 4,185,390 {vide Appendix IV). 3. The fact is also apparent that the coming of the Hamburg American steamers to the Gulf has given an immense impetus to this trade on the Continent, and that the greater proportion of the trade is falling into the hands of non-English manufacturers, (For details vide Appendix V.) 4. During the past year serious steps have been taken to stop the import of arms into Persia, but with very small results, namely a couple of dhows captured by the Navy, and one or two small shiploads thrown overboard by dhows when chased. What little success there has been has resulted from the efforts of Mr. New of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who has instituted a system of guards along the Makran coast to watch the gun-runners. A short resume of the scheme will be found in Appendix I. 5. The Persians were also induced to make an attempt to stop the caravans between the coast and the Afghan Border, but the results effected were nil. A history of the action taken will be found in Appendix III. 6. The accompanying map illustrates the routes which the individual arms caravans were reported to have taken between the coast and the Afghan border. Appendix II contains all particulars available regarding the caravans. ^yC 7 - Jhe double company at Robat was this year (1908) reinforced by 500 men whilst the caravans were on the move, and the Jashk detachment was in- forced by 2oo men owing to rumours that the gun-runners intended to revenge themselves on the posts for injuries and losses sustained at the hands of the Navy during the present year, and at the hands of the Robat detachment during the past year. 8. To sum up ; the traffic has increased to an enormous extent during the past twelve months, and all steps taken to interfere with it have proved ineffectual. The Navy appear to admit that they are practically powerless to accomplish anything with the means at their disposal, the Persians have proved that they are helpless, the detachment at Robat has shown that it can do nothing to interfere with the progress of the caravans, whilst the proceedings at the Brussels Arms Conference have not as yet afforded much hope of a satisfactory settlement. 9. From the accompanying appendices the following figures have been arrived at. 1906. — Rifles. Percentage. Ammunition. Percentage.

The figures of the present year show a considerable improvement as regards rifles, but there is very little information as regards ammunition. We have had no estimates of recent years as to the numbers of rifles imported into the Masqat hinterland. 10. Appendix X shows the various species of rifles and ammunition imported into Masqat and the Gulf. The Martini-Henry shows a constant percentage of over 75 per cent, during the last three years. However, it must be recollected that probably the greater proportion of the small bores imported come from the Continent, and are not included in the data for the figures given in the Appendix, not being available. The figures show that there has been a con siderable increase in the quantity of *303 ammunition in the present year, the proportion having risen from 14 per cent, to 44 per cent. This may probably be accounted for by the fact that Martini-Henry cartridges can be obtained and re-loaded in every large town in Persia, and that *303 ammunition must all be imported. A considerable number of *303 rifles, and a large amount of the *303 ammunition must be absorbed by the Persian Province of Pars, vide this Divi sion’s report on the subject of the distribution of arms in Southern Persia. It may be considered that a very large proportion of the small-bore rifles are ab sorbed in Western Persia, and that by far the larger proportion of the rifles which find their way into Afghanistan are Martini-Henrys, but with prices ruling as high as they do the importation of thousands of magazine small bores into Eastern Afghanistan and tribal territory may be regarded as inevitable in the immediate future. 11. A list of the firms connected with the arms traffic into Masqat is to be found in Appendix IX. The principal exporters of rifles during the present year have been— Laubenherg 8c Co. ,,, Birmingham. Livingstone, Zeytoon 8c Co. ... ... Manchester. S. K. R. Cama 8c Co. London.© 3 The principal exporters of ammunition have been— Haji Ali Akbar &amp; Son E. W. Carling &amp; Co. ... ... Livingstone, Zeytoon &amp; Co. *•« .«» Langstaff, Ehrenberg &amp; Poliak .m The principal importers of rifles have been— Ali Khan bin Musa Khan. A. Goguyer. Purshotum Dhunji. Mirza Muhammad. The principal importers of ammunition have been— Padumsi Mulji. M. Husain. Ali Khan bin Musa Khan. Manchester. London. Manchester. Liverpool. A. Goguyer. 12. Attention must be directed to the discrepancy existing between the value of British arms and ammunition trade into Masqat between ist April 1907 and 1st April 1908 as given by the Masqat Consular Trade Report, and as obtained from the Shipping Returns. The former shows the value of the trade at Rs. 1,521,480 and the latter at Rs. 1,067,298, a difference of Rs. 454,182. Less than a lakh of this difference is accounted for by the fact that some of the ships had sailed from England during the previous year, and that some had sailed from England before the 1 st April 1908 and had not reached Masqat in time to be included in the Trade Report.4 APPENDIX I. Scheme inaugurated by Mr. New, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, for the prevention of illicit Arms Trade on the Makran Coast. As it was found that information regarding the landing of arms on the Makran Coast was invariably received too late by His Majesty’s ships employed in the suppression of Arms Traffic, a proposal was mooted for the initiation, in T , , 0 . co-operation with the Navy, of a system Letter from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian r i j ,1 j 1 T* .

Mr. New’s scheme was submitted to the Government of India in December 1907, and the plan of operations decided on and now working is briefly as follows:— (i) A Jemadar and nine patrols with a small corps of camel sowars are engaged to watch the dis tricts between Jashk and Chahbar. These are posted on the principal roads at points about 30 miles from in the vicinity of the tele- Letters from Mr. New, to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, No. 96 , dated 1 st December 1907 , and No. 99 . dated 33 rd December 1907 . Letter from Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, to Foreign Department, No. 194 -?., dated nth March 1908 , the coast, while the remainder patrol graph line and along the coast. (3) Telephone stations have been established along the telegraph line at Arduri (24 miles from Jashk), Gabrig (40 miles from Jashk), Sadaich (62 miles from Jashk), Surug (80 miles from Jashk), Rapch (100 miles from Jashk and Chahbar), Bandani (80 miles from Char- bar), Bir (60miles from Chahbar), Kair (50 miles from Chahbar), Sirgan (25 miles from Chahbar), and Rodi (30 miles east of Chahbar). The line guards in charge of these stations watch the country along the telegraph line. ( 3 ) News of intended landings of arms obtained by any of the patrols is immediately sent in to the nearest telephone station and transmit ted to Jashk or Chahbar. It is then forwarded on to His Majesty’s ships and to the Political Agent at Masqat. (4) Arrangements have been made with a few trustworthy Baluchis at various points above the telegraph line to impart information, for which they are rewarded. (5) The Telegraph Officers in _ charge at Jashk and Chahbar have been supplied with maps showing rivers, hills, villages, roads from up country, and telephone stations, with full particulars of the scheme to guide them in transmitting information received from the line. (6) The Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf has agreed to two of Telegram from the Political Resident in the Subsidized Vessels be- Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Department, No. 682 , ing available for the SUD- dated the 28 th November 1907 . 5 &amp; 1 pression of 'arms traffic. One of these is always at Jashk or Chahbar and instead of, as formerly, ineffectually cruising off the coast, now relies wholly on the information supplied by the patrols before running out. It will be seen from the events of this year that these arrangements have met with some small measure of success. It is hoped at any rate that they will act as a deterrent to arms traffic between Masqat and the Makran coast which up to the time of their institution has been carried on practically with impunity.1 © 5 APPENDIX II. List of the arms caravans known to have made their way from the Makran Coast into Afghan territory during the years igoj and igo8, giving the routes followed by them, 1. An arms caravan of 150 camels travelled in March 1907 by the following route:— Bazman. Pan sura. Hanjira. Ab*i-Rais. Shuru. Mazarab. Nakhilat. Kal Amas. Ab-i-Khara. Chah*Duzak. Chah-i-Mastan. Kusagu. Chah*i*Kaftargu. Chah-i-Butago. Safidawa. Chah Nafar. Bal-i-Kumab. Chakau-Spr. Lash Juwain. From Bazman to Gurg this route lies in the Kirman desert and seems to be little known. From Gurg it follows the caravan road to Neh. It then turns east across the Palang Kuh range. The Bandan-Baring road is crossed on the Kain border near Hauz. 2 3 2. A caravan of about 200 camels with 80 men, in spite of an attempt to intercept it in the Kacha Gorge being made by the Chagai levies succeeded in reaching the Helmand in March T907. They took the following route :— Bazman. Pansura. Shurab. Murghak. Padai. Kaleh-i-Bid. Chaunali (?). Dukduh. Katar Kanjak. Kharnai. Manzilab. Siah Karai. Ab-i-Ahuan. Kacha. Zireh. Helmand. 3. On the 30th March 1907 an arms caravan which was following caravan No. 2 above mentioned, was ambushed by the Robat and Saindak levies in the Kacha Gorge and captured.The capture proved to consist of nearly 800 rifles and 70,000 rounds of ammunition. 4. A caravan of 200 camels received news of the Kacha capture at Bazman and being bound for Kandahar proceeded as under in May 1907 Bazman, Din. Shurab. Dig-i-Shikan. Chah Ghabi. Khwash (Washt). Dehan-i-Gazu. Rig-i-Malik. juzhak. Lut of Zeh. Zalu Chah, Chah Azam Khan, Hasan Khan of Khwash is reported to have taken 60 rifles and 5 pistols from this caravan, while Mir Jiand furnished guides, no doubt for a consideration. 5. This was a caravan of 30 camels for Herat. It travelled with caravan No, 4 as far as Bazman and then followed the same route as caravan No, 1 as far as Ab-i-Khara on the Nasratabad-Neh track. From this point it turned south- east to Turshab, apparently with the idea of crossing the frontier near Band-i- Kamal Khan; becoming aware of the presence of a force of Sistanis at Baluchab, a very short distance off, it turned from its line and making north, joined the route followed by caravan No. 1 at Safidawa. 6. A caravan consisting of 120 camels with 50 ra en made its way through into Afghanistan in April 1908 and took the following route Narmashir. Mazarab. Darshur. Panj Angusht. Baluchab, Jaru. Shila. Helmand (S. bank). Khwajeh Ali. Girishk. Kandahar. 7. An arms caravan consisting of about 80 camels with 50 men attempted to cross a corner of British Baluchistan in May. It started from Dashtiari and proceeded via Dizak. Kuh-i-Safid. Talab River. Juzhak (S. of Amalaf). Meeting however at this point the reinforcement proceeding to Robat under Colonel Fowler and being turned back by them it escaped with all rapidity from such a dangerous vicinity and doubling Robat proceeded vid Mirjawa. Ladis. Dizuk. Galuga. Dumagh. Baluchab (Pain).7 Here it came into collision with 270 Sistanis under Sardar Purdil Khan, but forcing its way through these without loss or diffi:ulty reached Afghan territory by Pu zeh- K un-i - D agal. Dasht-i-Mahi. Dak-i-Dela (on the Helmand). 8. The main Afghan Arms caravan consisting of over 1,000 camels with about 750 men and carrying about 12,5°° rifles and 2 million rounds of ammuni tion most of which had been landed in the vicinity of Jashk started from the coast at the beginning of May 1908 and proceeding by two routes one being via :— Angushki, Sirik, Taling, Jaghin, Manujan, and the other by— Jaghdan, Anguhran, assembled at Chah-i-Malik io miles south-east of Rigan on the 22nd May. On the 26th May it was attacked at Dashtak by 50 Persians under Shau- kat-uI-Mamalik but after a skirmish proceeded unharmed to Garagheh via :— Shuru, Mazarab, Gurg, Nasratabad Sipi. At Garagheh the caravan split up into two parties in order to facilitate the march through the dithcult country between this place and the Helmand. The river was reached by one party on the 9th June via Tappeh-i- Khakd-Darvish. Rigawak. Dak-i-Dela. And by the other party on the 1 ith June via Baluchab (Pain). Shila. Dasht-i-Tarakhun. Bandd-Kamal Khan. ft was reported later that the Dak-i-Dela party marched for Herat and the Band-i-Kamal Khan party for Ghazni. q. A small caravan headed by one Jodha a Kubdani crossed in May 1908, a corner of Baluchistan into Afghanistan. From Jalk he appears to have taken the following route :— Talab River. Talab Spr. Nodu. Borghar where he crossed the trade route. Darana Koh. Zireh. Bandd-Kamal Khan.APPENDIX III. A pr ecis of the action taken by the Persian Government to suppress the running cf arms caravans through South-East Persia in igo8 % Although the Persian Government gave certain assurances as to the mea sures it proposed to take for the suppression of illicit arms traffic and issued orders to the local administrations of Provinces through which the caravans of arms traders would pass, no practical result ensued. The sum-total of effort, however, consisted of certain half-hearted and isolated attempts to intercept arms caravans on their way from the Makran Coast to the Afghan border. The first attempt was made near Rigan where a large caravan of about 75a T , ,. „ men and over 1,000 camels had assembled. Telegram from Mr. James, telegraphist at Bam, tt i i r d 1.1 01 to the Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan, Under Orders of the Dam authorities Shaii- 20 th to a 8 th May 1508 . kat-ul-Mamalik with 50 men attacked this caravan at Dashtak on the 26th May, but his force being insufficient he retired after a skirmish and the Afghans proceeded on their way unharmed. On the same date a force of 400 men under Rifat Nizam left Bam with the avowed intention of attacking and capturing the above-mentioned caravan, but were, of course, too late and never came up with it. Rifat Nizam on reaching Fahreh disbanded his troops and returned to Bam. Peremptory orders were also issued to the Deputy Governor of Sistan Telecra’n from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and Rain to Send Out troops tO intercept for Sistan and Kain to the Foreign Department. arms Caravans as attempted to paSS through their territories, but no expenditure was sanctioned or organised arrange ments made for supplies. Sardar Purdil Khan was put in charge of the operations in Sistan. He e . t T &gt;. , c . .. q succeeded in assembling about 200 Sistan Diary No. 10 of April 1908 , . . 0 1 , • , • and 400 bistam sowars and placing his main body at Turshab, sent spies down the various roads by which caravans might approach. About 50 men also were collected at Varmal but little was expected of them. Chagai Diary No. 21 of July 1908 . armed with rifles. It was reported, moreover, that out of these numbers only about a hundred were On the 18th May Purdil Khan hearing of the advance of an arms caravan made dispositions to cut it off and moved out towards Baluchab. This caravan (No. 7) was the same one as had essayed to cross a corner of British Staff Diary of Officer Commanding the Baluchistan but had been turned back at Robat Column, 15 th to 24 of May 1908 . Juzhak by a detachment of Colonel Fowfler’s Dilr^Na^oniily xtol Uly I908 ana Chagai force Proceeding from Quetta to Robat. It consisted of about 50 men and 80 camels. Soon after passing Baluchab it came into collision with the Sistani force. As was to be expected the latter did not show up well. Apparently the men took good care to keep out of danger with the result that the loss they inflicted was nil and the caravan escaped with ease. After this fruitless effort Sistan Diary No. 25 , of July 1908 . Purdil Khan and his men returned to Lutak. No resistance was offered to the main caravan which passed through shortly afterwards, beyond the capture and decapitation of two Afghan stragglers who were found asHep, Purdil Khan contending that, as the attempt to capture the smaller caravan had been a failure, there was still less chance of success with the larger one, and his force might as well be withdrawn. Certain inadequate arrangements were, at the same time, under the orders of the Governor-General of Khorasan, made by the Shaukat-ubMulk, the Deputy Governor oi Kain, for dealing with Afghan arms caravans that might pass through his Province.9 i j Muhammad Yusuf Khan was put in charge of a force of about 800 men Sistan Diaries No. 4 of May 1908 and No. with his head-quarters at Bandan. Doubt* 24 of June 1908 . less the Shaukat-ul-Mulk did his best, but the bulk of these troops were armed with obsolete weapons and could not be expected to effect anything against strong parties of well armed Afghans. It was a cause of much relief to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk that all the Afghan caravans made their way through Sistan and that he was not called upon to oppose them. To sum up; although ample warning had been given to the Persian Government of the march of Afghan arms traders through south-eastern Persia and full information of the movements of the various caravans communicated to the local authorities, not a single one of these caravans was intercepted or so much as turned from its way : all that had been done was to incense Afghan feel ing against the Persians by the latter’s attempt to interfere with the caravans and by the murder of the Afghan stragglers. The arms smuggling traffic has now almost assumed the character of an armed invasion of Persia, and as the Persian Government would appear to be totally incapable of protecting its frontiers, jt seems that once the arms have been safely landed on the Persian coast there is little or no further impediment to be feared by the caravans.10 APPENDIX IY.
