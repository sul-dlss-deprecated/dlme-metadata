The circular mouth of the bottle is very small in comparison to the rim. The sides of the bottle are decorated with a sharply incised pattern of upward pointing chevrons linked by a central line. The bottle sits on the flat bench-like back of the horse whose slab-like forequarters are ornamented with another set of chevrons. The forequarters support two long, square-sectioned necks with small rounded heads whose only distinguishing elements are vaguely indicated ears. A curving handle arches from the back of the bottle to the back of the horse(s). The flat forms of the body, neck and legs suggest that the figure was built of clay slabs rather than modeled with rolls or coils. In contrast to the angular forms of the rest of the vessel, the tapered round tail curves up to touch the back.", "medium": "Clay", "dimensions": "height: 7 1/2 in. (19 cm)\r\nlength: 5 1/8 in.
