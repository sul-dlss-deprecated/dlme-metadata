The &lt;.iain points at issue are that the Saudi Covernaent's claim to the Jebel Nakhoh, v/hich is within P.C.L's Qatar concession, and the Xhor-e 1-Oueid wiiich is regarded by H.M.G. as within the territory of the S eikh O of Abu Dhabi. The question is whether the moment is yet opportune for an approach to Ibn Saud, in view of the ccmiaenooment of operations by the Oil Companies, or whether the matter should remain doonaant until his death, if Is hoped that the views of H.M.

The passage from Cairo to the U. K. would have to be authorised by the Priorities Board in Cairo. What I suggest you should do, therefore, is to send to Herbertson here (Captain J. J.W. Herbertson, M.V.O., O.B.E., Ariel House, W*C. 1) a letter explaining that you are anxious that Prior should be given an air passage home, considering that he has been at his post since the outbreak of war. Herbertson will then forward it to our man at Cairo, Colbeck, who deals with these things, and ask him to do anything which he finds possible. At the same time, perhaps you would tell Prior what you have done and advise him to write to Colbeck to find out if the passage will be forthcoming.

It seems therefore that there ought not to be difficulty about your recessing if the state of business permits and the I esident and the Government of India concur. to you, which you ought to discuss with Sir Trenchard in the first Instance. I am only sending you this line to ease your mind, as you were, I think, rather alarmed at the prospect of being stuck at Bahrein was not sure what, if any, arrangements there are trosVf 2.

I* E« , Croston Rectory, X^reston, Lancs.2. ‘;V Tmcial Coast s P.C.L* have obtained a concession from the Sheikh of Debai and that is out of the way. They have also obtained a concession from the Sheikh of Shargah but he is . ,jibbin;; at the moment about accepting the Political Agreement and Kxchan *e of Notes# Presumably he will yield to the pressure of the Political Authorities as* until he comes into line, it will not be possible for him to have H.M.CK’s approval of the concession and he will consequently be unable to get his money# As regards the rest of the Trucial Coast, it is not certain yet what the Company will do. It is probable that they will put off any further negotiations until the Autumn when the weather improves, but they have been asked by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to go and talk business with him, and it is possible that they may want to get on with that at once. Powle has said that he has no objection to either course# The real difficulty on the Trucial Coast has been the fear of competition from the Americans (The Standard Oil Company of California). We told than some months ago that * in view of the fact that P.C.L. had obtained options from the Trucial Coast rulers and were negotiating for concessions, ^ H.M.O# regarded P.C.L. as having prior rights in this area and could not approve of another company entering the field at that ■’ . V stage. The Standard Oil Company (for whom Mr# Ballantyne, a London solicitor of standing, acts as well as for the Bahrein Petroleum Company) replied that they understood the position and would do their best to meet H.M.G. *s wishes , but they added that they would be interested in obtaining Trucial Coast concessions if and whenever the opportunity occurred for them to do so with the consent of H.M#C&gt;. It is therefore not open to the Standard Oil Company to enter into negotiations with any Sheikhs without coming to H.M.O# first# If they should do so H#M.O# would almost certainly now take the line that as \ P.C.L. were first in the field (they have actually obtained3 . concessions from two Rulers) and as it is most undesirable that there should be more than one oil Company on the Trucial Coast, H.M.G. could not give their consent to any negotiations by any other Company. Communications to this effect have, in fact, been made by the Resident to the 3heikh of Umm-al-iaiwain (from whom P.C.L. have not got an option) and the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah (whose option expired on August 1 ). ■ 4 atar . P.C.L. have taken over the A.P.O.C. concession and things are, I think, running fairly smoothly though there have been various disputes about money between the Sheikh and the Company. 3o far as we ;:now, the Company do not propose to undertake any operations in Qatar for the present beyond boring wells for the Sheikh and the like. Kuwait . The Kuwait Oil Company* s operations continue without incident. They have discovered a certain amount of oil about 5,000 ft. down but the results were disappointing. They are now drilling (or are about to drill) in another spot - this time on the south side - and hope for better results. The main oil question in Kuwait at the moment is in regard to the Neutral Zone. P.C.L., with the approval of H.M.G. (the Foreign Office) have recently offered Ibn Saud £100,000 for an option over all his outstanding oil rights with a view to entering into negotiations for oil concessions. These rights would, of course, include his rights in the Neutral Zone in respect of which he is already committed to the Standard Oil Company of California who hold an option on them. The idea was that out of the £ 100,000 he would be able to buy out the Standard Oil Company. The latest news is, however, that Ibn Saud says that he would be unable to get out of his commitment to the California Company by buying them out, and it may be that the whole P.C.L. scheme will come to nothing. If, however, it should go through we shall be faced with a proposal by P.C.L., possibly in combination with the California Company, for a joint concession (from Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kuwait, who.i 'jam ■' 1 of ooirso, have oqvu.l eoverei^i righto therein) for tlio do lagrthlng Khleh would help Ibn Head to get oone money into hie powUfi since the friaaEidtiil|» and stability (Including» of cmr^eji the financial stability) of Seudi Arabia is felt to be K«HACK'S prime dj 03 idera^.im in the present delicate situation in the Middle last (delicate because of ales tine and Italian intrigue)* ^hey would f therefars* an (PMMl grounds* Hte* to see a Heutral ^one concesalon granted* On tli© other hand, the Sheikh at Kuwait lias hitherto been strongly averse from any development of the Neutral zamo since he Is understood to hop© to gain complete sovereignty over it in the event of the present Saudi regime coming to an end* He may* therefore, be unwilling to grant his share of the proposed joint concession* Moreover* if a joint concession is granted innumerable difficulties will no doubt arise in regard to the adrainlotration of the Seme. It might accordingly be for consideration how far pressure should be applied cm the Sheikh of Kuwait In furtherance of H*^*d* *s general policy and how far such pressure* If exercised* would be effective, /f’lhls, of course* is bound up to sense extent with the question of 'tightening at ; r iwait mentioned below^y 7 i.lnBoat. Nothing very rrr.ich is happening at present. For one thing the Sultan is generally absent from Ms capital and it is difficult to transact business. , 2his is a tendency which H.I1.G* would like to check as far as possible. His Highness is apparently contemplating a tour of Europe* perhaps extended to the United States* He apparently wrote to the President of the United States about it and has been invited to visit Mm In Washington. The Sultan had mi&amp; nothing to us shout a tour and a letter of taplled rdbutu it being addressed to him by Major Watts. You will probably hear Heutfal Sane. H*U*a. are anxious, at the present time* to5 from Colonel Fowl© what the reactions have been, if any. The difficulty is, of course, that the Sultan is an independent Ruler and, indeed, has treaty relations with the U. 3.A. But it is, of course, the policy of H.M.O*, as far as possi ble, to treat the Sultan in the same way as the other Arab rulers, and to have all his correspondence with foreign powers going through them or, at any rate, with their knowledge. There are various small questions connected with Muscat at the present moment regarding the cocmerciai treaty, air matters, etc., but I do not think there is anything worth mentioning here. Trucial Coast . There is not, I think, very much happening except in regard to oil. One matter of general political importance in this respect is that the Oil Company are very anxious to get information about the boundaries of the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms inter se and the precise political allegiance of the hinterland areas. We have taken up this point with Fowl© and shall have to discuss it with him when he cosies home. He will no doubt discuss it with you. H.M.O. are anxious to let the Company know as soon as possible roughly where they stand in this matter. There were recent disturbances arising out of the succession to the Sheikhdom of Kalba and the Sheikh of Ras-al- Khaimah got himself into trouble over this, but I think that has all died down now. Qatar . The main trouble recently has been a conflict between the Sheikh of Qatar and the Naim tribe who live in the 2Subarah district on the west coast. The tribe appealed to the Sheikh of Bahrein for assistance and His Highness was anxious to intervene in view of the fact that he has ancestral claims to the area in question. He was, however, warned off by the Resident, with H.M.G.’s approval, and the incident has, I think, been closed by the submission of the tribe to the Sheikh of Qatar. There may, however, be further6 . repercussions. H.M.G.^ general attitude on this is entirely in accord with Powle’s. They do not want to ofl'end the Sheikh of Bahrein if it can be avoided. But they do not see how any Bahrein claim on the mainland of Qatar can be allowed at the present day and they are anxious, while not offending the Sheikh of Bahrein, not to rouse false hopes in his breast. In any case, they are, of course, anxious to avoid the issue if it can be avoided and the submission of the tribe may make it possible to let the whole question be dropped. Kuwait,. There are the usual questions going in respect of Kuwait! the Date Gardena, the Saudi Blockade and the question of smuggling between Kuwait and Iraq. H.M.G. have, of course, been unable to implement their undertakings to the Sheikh in respect of the Date Gardens and the Saudi Blockade, and this must affect to some extent our approach to the main constant factor in Kuwaiti relations, namely, the question of 'tightening up’ 1 control over the Sheikh. It is definitely H.M.G.’e policy to tighten up as and when the opportunity occurs, but there are two difficulties, as we see it in the India Office. The first is that it is difficult to say what practical steps can be taken to tighten control over a person like the present Sheikh. The other difficulty is the unfulfilled promises referred to above. If, however, any opportunity should occur nevertheless for tightening control H.M.G. would always be glad to consider profiting by it. Kuwait questions are not likely to be very active for a bit since it is understood that the Sheikh is just off to Cairo for dental treatment and is not expected back in Kuwait until the middle of September. ^di Arabian Boundaries . This question ought to be fairly dead for the next few months. It has become clear recently that Ibn Saud is notr* •*/m - ? IMHRiRIIMHiP 7. ready to settle the houndary question and it will have to be left in suspense for some time* One minor question may» however# arise. It has been suggested that some sort of topographical mission or fact-finding committee, riiich would include representatives of the Saudis, H#M*Q* and the SheiJch of ^atar, might investigate the area around the Jebl Nakhsh at the foot of the ; atar Peninsula, which is the main bone of contention between H*M*G* and Ibn Saud, with a view to persuading Ibn Saud that it is not really his territory as he claimed. The details of the scheme would have to be worked out by the departments concerned (including the Treasury) in consultation with Jedda and Bushire, if Ibn Saud is disposed to accept it in principle. The thing to remember, from our point of view, in this connection is that it is desirable to explain matters carefully to the Sheikh of Qatar lest he should think that we are letting him down in any way, and that he should be represented on any committee or commission* Sishire_He s1dency Move* We have discussed this and I think you might have a word with alton about it. In any case, we are agreed that the question will not affect you as Resident. It is, at present, between the Secretary of State and the Viceroy. Air mattei’s. Empire air mail arrangements but no questions of policy arise in this connection. I think that Imperial Airways have now got the facilities they want both for their land planes and for their sea-planes. The present idea is to try and get some seaplanes flying regularly down the Gulf about October this year* No other points occur to us at present as being worth mentioning to you. Walton has approved what I have written.— masaammmgmr* »&gt; / iJ* C? 4746 1937 ETPAffl. (33 groups o) 3470 (COPIES CIRCULATED) DECYPHER OF TELEGRAM.

Fowle to come home for a short period in the late summer on leave combined with deputation, in order to discuss with this Office and other Depts. the numerous Gulf problems in which H.M.G. is interested, and decisions on which can be expedited by oral discussion. This arrangement has been found to be of considerable value. Col. Fov/le, in his d.o. letter to the G. of I. of 6th lay, proposes to come home as usual by air at the end of July, and as Col. Loch, who has usually acted for him in his absence, is now on long leave, that 1 ajor Watts, Political Agent, P. use at, should act for the Political Resident this year during his short absence . It will be seen from the telegram below that the Viceroy does not agree to this latter suggestion, and will therefore be unable to grant leave to Col. Fowle( though he appreciates the desirability of his coming to England) unless other arrangements can be made. There seems no reason to dissent from the Viceroy’s view of the matter and we might, as suggested in the telegram, approach Hr.

Fowle has accordingly applied for such short leave and deputation combined this summer, and contemplates leaving the Gulf by air at the end of | July- I hear from I etcalfe that, though the Viceroy appreciates the desirability of Fowle coming to this country as usual, a difficulty has arisen on this occasion in making adequate acting difficulty H.E. has proposed that you should be asked to curtail your leave and go out to act for Fowle during his the current problems of the Gulf as accordingly asked me to approach you immediately and ascertain whether you c«0 arrange to arrive at Bushire by the O.K.

With regard to tne question of permitting the Political Agent, Kuwait, to recess in Palestine during future years, tne Government of India will be glad if you would examine the question in more detail. In particular they desire to know (a) whether the proposal entails any extra expense to Government on account of travelling expenses or postage and telegr&amp;piiie charges, and(b) how much longer* if at all, it would take instructions issued by you from Buahire to reach the Political Agent recessing in Palestine by post or telegram tiian it would if he would continue to recess at Karachi.4424 5000 1/36 Minute Paper.

It will, it is hoped, be agreed that since both the Government of India and H.M.G. (who pay half the charges involved) are satisfied, and since this Department can testify to the great practical advantage of having Colonel Powle here for a month or six weeks in the autumn, the arrangement is one that can safely be approved.

We have no objection at all to the proposal that Fowle should be allowed to take leave for a couple of months each summer and should be placed on deputation for a month or six weeks in interruption of the period of his leave. Indeed, as you know, our view is that the more closely we can keep in personal touch with him on all the various complicated political questions we have to deal with through him,the better. We note that this arrangement will be subject to review after two years 1 experience. Yours very sincerely. qq r%\y c.C MY RY AIR J.c. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C.D.O. No.F.32(55)-E/34. A.

I discussed the question with Fowle when he was here lately. Your suggestion was that the Resident (on the assumption that local conditions permit) should he allowed to take leave for a couple of months every summer, should pay his own way home and hack, and should he placed on deputation for a month or six weeks in interruption of the period of his leave. Fowle also considered that this was the best suggestion. The Government of India are prepared to accept this arrangement provided it remains open to review after two years in the light of conditions then prevailing and that the cost of the leave and deputation is as usual shared in moieties by the Home and Indian revenues. Will you kindly obtain sanction of His—— '' ' ' - - ' ~ Majesty's Government to the proposal and inform us as soon as possible? I presume that you may want Powle to come Home this year after Loch comes hack in July; so it would he convenient to have orders passed without delay.

During at least 5 weeks he was constantly employed either in discussions in the Department on various outstanding points connected with the Gulf or in attending conferences. It was much the same last year and so long as the Gulf remains as much in the forefront as it is at present I should very much doubt if the Resident will escape much more lightly on any future occasion when he happens to be in this country. I do not think I need labour the arguments for fairly frequent consultation with him.

I think; to. Grist 1 s solution is probably the right one. For some time to come, unless there is a material change in conditions in the Gulf, it will be of the greatest advantage to nave tne Resident available for personal consultation once a year. If the Resident is prepared to pay his own way home (subject perhaps to — (V*. *A-lvs hi lAjft' C*m KA.h' AAAi&lt;-Lv~) i*_AA/ the possibilityfrrT a Government grant every third year^ and to accept deputation for a month or six weeks during the period of his leave, this would meet tne case with relatively snail expense to Government. 3. If you agree I will put up a draft to to. Ivletcalfe pressing the case for annual leave (subject always, of course, to suitable acting arrangements being possible and toCSonditions in the Gulf admitting of this}, a portion of which could be turned into deputation in the event of our using tne Resident as much as we nave used him this year and last year, we can develop the factors which make tne position of tne Resident essentially different from that of tne ordinary Indian political officer, who does not deal direct with the Departments of H.If.G. % 4-Financial Secretary, The Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf last x year raised with the Government of India the possibility of some special arrangement being made the effect of which would be to secure that he should come on annual leave to this country from the Gulf - see corresponaence attached. 2* The objections seen by the Government of India to Colonel Fowle's proposal are set out in kr. ketcalfe's letter of 8th February, P.Z.1307/34. The Resident in the Persian Gulf is'ina different position from any Ihdiai resident In tnat he is primarily responsible to H.L.G. and that at least four Departments of the Imperial Government are closely interested in his work anu collaborate in the drafting of instructions to him. There is, therefore, a a good case on general grounds for having him home every year* On the other hand, fee Resident hass only a limited amount of (leave at his disposal ana the difficulties in increasing the amount of leave on average pay which he can take are set out in hr. Metcalfe’s letter. We should like, if possible, to be able to put some constructive suggestion to the Government of India on ( w f' vCtui *&gt; »cuu4-h-e( btKtJ the subject when letting them knowfthat for official reasons it is regarded as desirable if possible to secure an annual visit (even if not a long one) to this country uy the Political Resident. The main alternatives that occur to me are; (a) some special contribution to the cost of his passage (his leave counts from door to door ano if he is not to spend an undue portion of it in travelling it is necessary that he should come home by air); or■ « a.

Whax would be the financ±a± effect^of placing the xiesident on deputation during leave? Prom our point of view some ad hoc arrangement on these lines is probably desirable, because if it proves impossible to arrange it we may be driven, as we were last year, to bring the Resident home on duty (paying his passage both ways) for a fortnight or three weeks to discuss outstanding questions. cCe f t C - S % &lt; j ^ nr cx/vw/ ^^7 4^ 0W U _ /ii ^ ^ 4, A, 44 ^u4/- (r~, ^ u C^, C-^^eCu A.mm — From (COPIES CIRCULATED &gt; Dated Beoeivsd Laeutanant Colonel TcC ft W, Fowle, CoB^E.,, to Secretaiy of Slate for India* Bushire* 5th June* 1934* 7,45 pciri.j 5th June* 1934« 537 o Addressed to Goverrorisnt of India* 537* repeated to Tehran* 74 v India Office, 537, Subject to sanction of higher authorities concerned I propose to proceed on 3 months leave from July 19ih* I suggest that Loch acts for me here and Worth for Loch at BahreincI mentioned the question of Colonel Loch acting for Colonel Fowle in the event of the latter being granted leave this summer to you yesterday.

On receipt of Fov/le 1 s letter of which copies were sent to you and Hoare we at once took up the matter with the Foreign Office, who had simultaneously heard from Hoare.

Please refer to the correspondence ending with my yf}( Demi-Official letter No 187-S of 19th February last to Metcalfe copy of which I sent to you.Briefly the situation is as follows. I suggested tentatively that when the Resident went on leave he might be given a special rate of pay-though I remarked that I quite realised the difficulties of altering the regulations to suit individual hard cases.Metcalfe replied that he regretted my suggestion was not practical. 3. There remained the question of my going on leave on ordinary rates of pay with Loch to act for me here.This also Metcalfe said could not be granted.I took the opportunity of discussing it with him when I visited Delhi the other day and found that (as you had informed him) the difficulty lay in the fact that the Foreign Office were adverse to Loch acting for me.Metcalfe took a lot of trouble in going into the question of whether any officer outside the Gulf could be deputed to act for me, but the long and short of it is that there is not .So if Loch is not allowed to aet tot me I cannot go on leave,which is rather herd. I need not reiterate all the arguments'which I have already put forward*for the Resident going on short leave;apart t from anything else his* persona^contacts 1 with the Departments at Home,are very useful,as were mine last year.On another aspect I should like,however,to lay stress. n ue is not a r( 2 ). A ssnatori^UHi in tne iiot weatner,and I hare had exactly three months leave in the last rive years» 4* I discussed with Xks Metcalfe the question of Loch acting for me and made* the following points* (a) That Loch was really quite a level headed fellow,was doing well in Bahrein (he has just,for instance,concluded success fullythe delicate matter of purchasing the land required by Govt)and except for the Bassidu business did all right when act ing last year*If it had not occurred there would presumably have been no objection for his acting for me this year* (b) That before Loch took over from me he could be given a suitable warning or advice. (c) Having been given this advice he would be most un likely to go off the deep end again .That it is very hard to damn a man for one mistake.We have all of us made mistakes in our careers,aftd most of us have been fortunate enough to be given a sec ond chance• (d) That the period of my proposed leave,middle of July to middle of August, is generally a pretty dull one in the Gulf. (e) That if there were crises in the offing I would not proceed on leave and if anything serious cropped up when I was in England I could return by air in a few days* b* under these conditions M.etcalfe agreed to Loch ararfc‘ , fr‘»g acting* tfhen I met Hoare at Ispahan I put up the same arguments and he likewise agreed* As all the three authorities on the spot,the Govern ment of India,the Minister,and myself(after all I certainly would not entrust my post to ahyone whom 1 thought likely to make a mess of it) are agreed that Loch can carry on well enough,I trust that the foreign Office will withdraw their objection* I am sending copies of this letter to ho«e and Mete \—(r L vLt^ ^^If e* 6 . 7*' — • — — - «i INDEXED b~ r n / i r® U.

Fowle adds that he has been giving him great satisfaction as P.A.,Bahrain, and he tells me that he proposes to write to you personally about the question. I realize of course that Fowle is very anxious to go on leave which may perhaps colour his opinions about Loch T s capacity to carry on. Our position is merely that we can let Lock to officiate for him and no one else; if he is not accepted Fowle cannot go on leave. J.C.'Walton.

I am sorry(^but not altogether surprised) to hear that there are likely to be objections to Loch acting again for Fowle, and I may add that I entirely agree that we ought to take steps to avoid the very awkward situation which will arise if that objection is taken in an official form. The solution which you suggest is attractive at first sight, but after careful examination of the List I am afraid that there are practical objections which cannot be overcome. Fowle who is the permanent Resident only counts his seniority in the Political Department from June 1914,and,it would,I think, be unreasonable to expect any officer senior to him in the Department to go to Bahrain merely with the expecta tion of officiating for Fowle for two or three months in the summer. It is true that Loch is himself senior to Fowle, but he was sent to Bahrain because we had no other job for him at the time and the only other people of about that seniority who could be considered suitable for an exchange would be Skrine or Wingate. Wingate cannot be spared from here and would certainly object strongly to being transferred to Bahrain on such condition^and Skrine would■M would, I think, also object and we should find it very- difficult to persuade Baluchistan to let him go. The next difficulty we are up against is that Loch’s relief would have to be senior to Bremner, if he were intended to act as Resident in preference to Bremner. This leaves us only about 16 names to choose from of whom four are on Foreign Service, two are Indians, one (Wickham) has retired and of the remainder only Major G.T.Fisher can be considered as having any qualifica tions for a post in the Persian Gulf. Had Fisher been now available, I should have been inclined to try for an exchange between him and Loch, but unfortunately he cannot now be spared from Hyderabad, since D.G. Mackenzie is going home on leave and Fisher himself intends to take a year’s leave in the autumn. It is therefore quite clear that we can do nothing about removing Loch from Bahrain this year, nor should we be owing able/to an acute shortage of officers to send anyone else from India to act for Fowle. The irresistible conclusion to my mind is that,if Loch cannot officiate^ Fowle cannot get leave this year. By next spring matters will, I hope, have cleared up considerably. Both Loch and Bremner applied for leave this year which was refused and it may be expected that both will go on leave next year. In that case-3- case we can fill these posts with officers of considerably less seniority who would have no strong claim to the acting Residency when Fowle takes leave. In that case we should I think propose that Dickson,who will have had his leave this year, should act for Fowle and I take it that this would satisfy all Departments of His Majesty f s Government and also the Minister at Tehran. There may be difficulties regarding an officer on a temporary contract acting as a First Glass Resident, but I fancy that these could be overcome. Would you let me have your comments on thli snggestioni as soon as possible, as we shall have to decide before long whether Fowle is to get his leave or not this yearl J.C.Walton,Esq.. C.B..

Prjvatg mid Personal You will have had by now my air mail letter of 5th January, No. P.Z. 8138/33, about the proposed annual leave of the Resident. Fowle's proposals on this point raise, however, another question of some delicacy, to which I was anxious to give more thought before writing to you, and that is the position of Loch, whom, as you will remember, Fowle recommends to act as Resident during his own leave. 2. As I think you gathered when you were here in the autumn, the F.O.(and also, I understand, Hoare personally as well as Mallet) were very critical of Loci^s handling of the Basidu situation and made it clear to us I informally at the time that they thought he had shown a lack of the qualities required in a post so important as that of Resident. We, I need not say, although we had ourselves an uneasy feeling that Loch had started very well but had become rather wooden and inelastic as the situation developed, consistently maintained in our discussions with the F.O. that we could not listen to any criticism of him, and/ 1925 5000 G.334-/ z. and that he hadthout^i^y done very well in difficult circumstances. 3. After Fowle’s return to Bushire, however, the F.O. tactfully but clearly intimated to us privately that while they A regarded the filling of any acting vacancy as entirely a matter for the Gr.of I. and the S/S, they would definitely prefer that hsr should not again be left in charge at Bushire. IBris,' I 1 need not say, was irot-^oenveyed -t-Q ua officially^ They made no positive request,and did not say in so many words that they would formally object if Loch were in fact to officiate. But,,-little room w-aa_laft fe-r doubt on— jhis point; and the position as we now see it is that there is a real risk that if Loch is formally proposed the F.O.(or Hoare, whose consent to the appointment of an Acting Consul-General, Bushire, would, of course, have to be obtained under the existing procedure) may object. It would of course be almost awkward if this were to happen at short notice, and it is because of this and because of our anxiety both to avoid any reflection on Loch and to give the F.O no excuse for interfering officially vrith the filling of the Besidency that I now toko the-mat Wr up with you.3 Draft Paper. 1925 5000 ' ~ ' ~ - ' Department. 4, [4cfully recognise the delicacy of the position. On the one hand, while, as I say, we may have had some doubts about Loch from time to time, we think he has done most useful work in the Gulf and shown himself interested and keen, and we would be most reluctant in any way to prejudice his future or to allow any reflection to be cast upon him merely because of his handling of affairs when he was acting as Resident last year. On the other hand, the attitude of the F.O. is as I have described it; and to send a senior^fficer from India to act as Resident over Loch’s head in Fowle’s absence would be a very marked criticism of him. (Apart from that, there are obvious disadvantages, when the Residency is, as at present, of first class importance politically, in bringing in an officer without local experience merely to fill an acting vacancy for two or three months, on the expiry of which he would revert to India.) The only way out of the difficulty which occurs to us is an exchange between Loch and some officer with the qualifications needed for Gulf service at present holding some post of comparable standing in India ( - without suggesting names, which we 6.33 are not, of course, in a Position todo, the type of exchange we had^in mind would he, e.g., with Skrine, who is at present P.A. Kalat, and who is of much the same seniority). If something on these lines was possible it might he the out easiest way/of a situation which has the makings of considerable awkwardness. 5. I fear that to add this last and worst problem is a poor return for all the assistance you have given us over various delicate posting questions in the last few months, but I am sure you will share our views as to the desirability both of saving Loch’s face and of keeping the F.O. out of/these appointments, and that you will understand that we are approaching you and asking for your help only because in the circumstances I have described above there hs can be judged-, a real danger that if we have not cleared the ground well in advance we may be faced with a situation which we would both be anxious to avoid. I need not say how grateful we shall be for any help or advice you can give us. (B4.) J. C. W ALTOS.--fz StiS r 'i' Mr. Walton, Please see Colonel Fowls 1 s letter below to Mr. Metcalfe on the subject of annual leave for the Political Resident. The case for this, if it can be arranged, is, 1 think,a strong one. Particularly now that the Gulf is in such close touch with London and that so many departments are interested in its affairs, it is of the greatest assistance to nave the Resident available for informal discussion every year. I ao not know if you would think it worth writing to the Government of India on the lines of the draft attached? It might strengthen Mr. Metcalfe's hands if there are any local difficulties. 2.

Just as important, or perhaps more important, is the official benefit which is obtained **rom the fact *hat he is available during his leave for consultations with the various Home departments interested in the Gulf, and during mv last leave, as you know, 1 did a good deal in the way of consultations, and was very pleased to do so. ^rom the time point of view London is now no further from Bush ire by Air than Karachi is by sea, and in the near future when all night flying comes in may be even nearer. My colleagues, too, in the Middle d a st, bubassador, Baghdad, High CfcmniBBioner, Palestine, Kinister, Jedda, get home every hot weather. I think therefore that it might be accept-ed as a principle x hat the Besident should get home on leave every Bummer? 3. dith regard to the period of his leave. ^wo months/ The Hon ’ble Mr.H.A.B.MetcalfejG.B.T., c.i.h. ,ji.v.o* , foreign Secretary to the Goveivi- ment of India, Hew deihi.months is rather a rush: I should say three months is suitable, and not excessive: 'tyan, as far as 1 remember, told me he had four months in ^upland, nhile the ^eeident f p leave of course counts from door to door. 4. With regard to the Wesident’o pay shile on leave, ^hin of course Is laid down under the Government of India regulations on the subject. 'briefly, shat it comes to is that if the Resident is in the happy position of having three months (sav) on full nay to his credit he can fro on leave for that period on full oav; but if he has less than that amount to his credit he tfoes on half pay for the balance. When I went on leave this year, bavin* taken none for nearly four vears, I had four months on full oay ^in the bank M . 1 took three. Next year if I *o on three months, havinr earned another month in the interval, I shall have only two months on full pay, and one on half. ''Mo is rather hard, and the year after that (193P) my position sill be still worse, since 1 shall only be able to take one month on full nay, and as of course my fare by air both ways comes out of my own pocket I shallhave to think twice about *oin* on leave at all.

The ^ arrangement in question is briefly that the Political Resident is directly responsible to, and corresponds directly with, His Majesty’s Government, as represented by the Colonial Office, stcr, on questions affecting Ibn Baud, except when Ibn Baud is in the Hejaz. Communications to the King of the Hejaz and Nejd when sent through the Persian Gulf are to pass through the Political Resident, except in cases of a wholly exceptional character and of very great urgency, in which case they may pass through officers subordinate to the Resident who are in direct contact with Ibn Baud or the Sheikh of Koweit. There is no reason to oeiiove that difficulty is experienced in transmitting messages to His Majesty during the hot weather/weather recess, and there is no record ol any difficulty ever having arisen in this connection.

It will be remembered that, consequent on a complaint from the Senior Naval Officer that the administration of the Gulf during the hot season was made difficult from his point of view by the fact that the Political Resident and his staff and the Political c Agents left the Gulf for a recess of three or four months (as to which no information was available here), the question of recess arrangements in the Persian Gulf was taken up with the Government of India in Mr. Wakely's letter of 20th December to Sir Denys Bray on P. 6497/28, flagged. 2. Prior to the issue of this letter, on 6th December (see P. 719) Sir Frederick Johnston had , written to the Government of India on the question of the headquarters for the summer recess of 1929. In his letter he strongly recommended that Shiraz, which had hitherto been used as the summer headquarters, should be abandoned, and that the Resident should b,e allowed to recess at Karachi, spending, however, June in Simla. 3. The detailed recommendations of the Political Resident and of the Government of India in reply to Mr. Wakely’s letter of 20th December will be found in the Viceroy’s telegram of 5th March on P. 2007, and Sir f Frederick Johnston’s letter of 22nd January on P. 2113. The Government of India and the Political Resident agree in considering it in the public interest, on a broad view, to maintain the present arrangements for a hot weather recess. Sir Frederick Johnston remains of the opinion previously expressed by him that Karachi is preferable for this purpose to Shiraz, and comments on the general unsuitability of Bushire. The Government of/ 3222a 5000 11/28of India recommend, however, that Shiraz should be retained in the case of the Political Resident, the Political Agents, as hitherto, being allowed to recess at Karachi. Nothing is said about the permanent retention of a British duty officer at Bushire, as suggested in Hr. Wakely’s letter, but Sir Frederick Johnston, in his letter of 22nd January, expresses the opinion that no such officer is necessary so long as the Resident is on quick wire. On the question of codes the Government of India offer no observations, but Sir Frederick Johnston considers it unnecessary to leave codes at Koweit, Bahrein or Muscat. 4. Since the matter was taken up with the Government of India, both the Foreign Office and the Admiralty have referred unofficially to the unsatisfactory situation created by the withdrawal of senior British personnel from the Gulf during the summer, and more especially now that the position in the Gulf of the Government of India is being attacked, it is desirable to go so far as possible to meet them. On the other hand, the arguments set out in the Viceroy's telegram of 5th March in favour of a hot weather recess are very strong; Sir Frederick Johnston's resignation illustrates the strain imposed by the climate on an officer so senior as the Political Resident is normally likely to be; and in the interests of securing a degree of continuity of service in the different posts in the Gulf it seems difficult to resist the Government of India’s contention that a recess should be allowed, subject to adequate arrangements for the return of officers to their posts without delay should the situation necessitate this. 5. In these circumstances the Department would submit for consideration the following recommendations;- (a)/Minute Paper. political Department. s/ 3222a 5000 11/28 (a) that we should agree with the Government of India as regards recess, on the understanding stated in the last sentence of their telegram of 5th k.arch; (b) that we should accept their view that Shiraz - unsatisfactory as that may be in certain ways - rather than Karachi, should be the recess head quarters of the Political Resident. (In the case of the Political Igents the objections to Karachi are possibly less strong, though, whatever about Muscat, it will take the Political .\gent, Koweit, a long time to get back from Karachi to his post in the event of trouble. The summer, however, is likely to be a quiet time in Koweit. Under Sir Lionel Haworth's regime the Political Agents are understood to have summered at Shiraz with the Political Resident.) (c) that, with a view to reassuring the Imperial Departments concerned, we should ask the Government of India to arrange that a duty officer shall be permanently kept at Bushire, despite Sir Frederick Johnston's opinion to the contrary. It is understood from Sir Lionel Haworth that it was his practice, when Political Resident, to have an officer there permanently during the summer (although the duty officer had been temporarily recalled to Shiraz at OX. by the time of the Tamb incident), and, as a Secretary and Under-Secretary, it ought to be possible to arrange for this without imposing an undue strain on any individual; (d) that the question of ^codes at Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat should be dropped, unless the Admiralty desire to pursue it. If there is a duty officer at Bushire with whom the Senior Naval Officer can if necessary/necessary get in direct touch, it should rodtrao tne- igiportttfico of the absence erf' codes- in tho outlying 6. It will be desirable to consult the Imperial Departments concerned (Foreign Office, Colonial Office, Admiralty - Air Ministry are hardly affected) on the arrangements to be made. It is perhaps preferable not to circulate Sir Frederick Johnston’s letter, despite th3 references to it in the Government of India’s telegram, in view of its statements as to the unsuitability of Bushire, which might be used against us in favour of the removal of the Residency from Persian soil, on which we are at the moment anxious to keep a free hand.'T’- Draft Paper.

The safeguards &lt; referred to in the last paragraph of the Government of India’s telegram should ensure that no serious difficulty arises, but Lord Peel is inclined to think that it would be well, if possible, to arrange, in addition, that a duty officer shall normally be present at Bushire throughout the i hot weather in possession of the confidential codes.

A sick officer or an officer with broken nerves is worse that no officer at all and there are few salamanders wno can see a not weather through in this climate. unless it is desired to have the Gulf considered the penal settlement of the Political Department, where none will willingly go and all be discontented, you will either have to give two or three months Gulf leave in addition to that under the fundamental Rules or raise the local allowances to some labulous figure which will induce the financially straitened to risk their healths in return. The system of recess ± in Karachi has created no trouble in the past and 1 see no reason why it should do so in the future. In case of need an officer can leave forth with for his charge and be there in a few days. When his opinion, not his presence, is required, he can under existing postal and telegraphic facilities give it no less promptly from Karachi. What is required in the Gulf is some continuity of tenure and health by Political Agents and any attempt to limit the small amenity now enjoyed would, 1 am convinced, effectually preclude these. fou will doubtless also consider the aspect that the acceptance of the principle of denying recess to Political Agents in the Gulf would necessitate a drastic revision of all recess arrangements among officers of the Political and Department in india/that the application of the principle might possibly be further expanded. As regards the location of the Resident, with communications what they are, a steamer once a week or once a fortnight, it does not seem to matter suds tantialiy where he is located provided the following conditions are satisfied!* (1) He must oe within prompt ana direct telegraphic communi cation and witnin reasonable postal communication havingmamm mm Tr having regard to conditions in the Gulf. (ii) He must have with him a complete office to enable him to deal promptly with all references. (3 ) He must be able when occasion arises to proceed promptly to any place within nis. charge. 'ML (4J ne must be in a place where is is accessible to all who wish to visit him and from which he can move freely without vexatious restrictions. (5J He must have the reasonable amenities of climate allowed to other first class Residents. Conditions ^1} to ^4j are absolutely unfulfilled in the case of Shiraz and conditions (3) to(5) in the case of Bushire. Personally I can see no advantage under the changed condftions oi tne last few years in remaining on Persian soil where our presence is now of no advantage ana condi tions under Persian passport regulations are daily approximating to those of an internment camp, shipping conditions are difficult, and the staff are now justifiably asking for extra allowances on account of the increased cost of living under tne new Persian Customs rates. fours sincerely, Sd.

The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi. Summer Headquarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. £v«- ^ &lt;JL Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the summer headquarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for the ensuing summer. 2. Sir Lionel Haworth has at various times pointed out the unsuitability of Bushire as a summer residence and there is no doubt as to the correctness of this view. An officer of the age at which first class Residents are appointed cannot be expected to withstand so trying a climate, and there seems to be no reason why the Resident in the Persian Gulf should not be allowed the same amenities of climate as other Residents of the first class. 3. As a summer residence Sir Lionel Haworth advocated Shiraz, but I am very doubtful if this is suitable. It is situated in Persian territory and the presence in Persia of the Resident for the Persian Gulf is not nowadays very acceptable to the Persians. It adds to the inaccessibility of Bushire as it is 200 miles from Bushire over a bad road which is always liable to be interrupted by weather or brigandage. Transport is very expensive so as to prohibit the move of any essential part of the office. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Utter No. 3 M. Dated 1 ; j AN tiered 2 8 JAN. 132S 4.4# 0n whole I consider that Karachi is preferable, ihe various Political Agents have in the past been in the habit of recessing there and touch is enabled to be main tained with them. Muscat is nearer Karachi than Bushire an postal arrangements from elsewhere are about equally con venient. Sea transport being cheap an essential part of the office and staff can be taken there at reasonable expense and there is no reason why a further economy should not be efjected by combining the move to and from Karachi with a tour of the Gulf. Further in the event of necessity arising there is always available at Karachi some vessel in which the \ Aratl ports can be reached. As however the climate of Karachi is exceedingly trying in June I consider that the Resident should be allowed to recess for that month in Simla. This will enable I him to obtain that touch with the Government of India which has been greatly wanting in the past. 5. As regards expenditure there seems to be no reason to expect that the cost will be any greater than that of the move to Shiraz. In fact owing to the reduced telegraphic expenses it is possible that there might be an eventual saving. Bungalows for the Resident and for the office can be obtained for the summer at a cost of about Rs.3,000. It would not seem to be unreasonable to require the Resident to provide his own accommodation during his recess at Simla, receiving only the same railway facilities as are given to other first class Residents. 6 - 1 shall be glad to receive early orders on this reference as it is necessary to consider arrangements for the forthcoming summer. I have, etc., Sd/- F.W. Johnston, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.f l-. Cx I'Uyjq/ /(XfcA Under Secretary of State , The chief point of interest in this submission is the Senior Naval Officer’s complaint that the various Agencies, etc., in the Gulf are left vacant save for an Indian subordinate, who does not possess any confidential code, during the hot weather recess. This is a point which came to notice earlier in the summer when, on the occasion of the Tamb incident, there was no British officer at Bushire in possession of the codes, the Political Resident and his Secretary, Under Secretary, etc., being in recess at Shiraz. Department serving in the Persian Gulf are allowed a three months' recess during the hot weather; that up to three or four years ago the Political Agent, Muscat, used to recess in Kashmirr that since then he £s not^allowed to go farther afield than Karachi. It would, of course, be very hard on the Political Resident and the Political Agents in Koweit, Muscat and Bahrein that they should be required to forfeit their hot-weather recess, particularly in the Gulf climate, but it is perhaps for Consideration whether some special arrangement could not be made to have at any rate one representative of the Government of India in possession of the confidential codes in the Gulf during the hot season, more especially while the Gulf is so much to the fore as it is at present, and the point is one which it may be thought worth taking up with the Government of India, either privately or officially. The ordinary practice in Indian Provinces is, I understand, to leave an Under Secretary or a Secretary to I understand that officers of the Political represent/ miP.6497.

Admiralty by the Senior Laval Officer, ^rith particular 1928 with end. reference to his complaint tlmt the Gulf Agencies and the Residency at Bushire are left witliout a British officer {and incidentally, it is 3U£5^eated / without any confidential codes) for three or four nonths during the recess. We are not very clear as tc.* the exact arrangei^nts in this natter which bars bean approved by the Gtovernnent of India, I understand from TLarcrth that it is in fact the case that, largely on grounds of health, the Political Agents and the Resident and his staff all receco at Shiras or in India for three months or eo during the hot weather, but that he lias Sir D. de 3. Bray, ClE,,CSI.,CBc,.,IG3. Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.. endeavouredendeavoured in the past to keep a duty officer (the Secretary or Under Secretary) at Bushira with the codes* This arrangement however appears to work rather uncertainly, for dutinp* the Tanib incident a cause of complaint alike by Senior Naval Officer and Foreign Officer was that there was no British officer at Buohire and Haworth I gather bad in fact temporarily recalled him to Shiras without replacing him. Moreover as regards the Resident himself* it seemed to us that he might as well have been in London or Simla for all the use he was in Shiraz, The Secretary of State fully appreciates the difficult conditions under which officers serve in the Gulf, and the need for a hotwaather recess. Fa feels, however, that it is very* desirable, at a time when the Gulf is so much to the fore, and when the position in it of the Government of India is being challenged, that we should Jfe.ve no loophole for criticism; and he desires ma to say that he would be glad if the Government•mr ^ 3. Goveroiwnt of IncUa would examine tho question (on which we may be pressed by the Fo^eipi Office) in consultation with the Political Hesident (whose experience, however, is necessarily limited) and in the light of the practice, which, it is understood, prevailed before Sir L.Haworth’s tenure of the appointment, and lot him have their considered views on it as a whole, w^iat is desirable, if the existing recess arrangoiranta are maintained, (a point on which the Secretary of State is not at present satisfied) would appear to be the permanent retention of a British duty officer at Buahire, coupled possibly with regular visits by a British officer during the recesa (whether the Political Agent, or the Secretary or Under ^crebexy to the ^eaident) to tho various %sncies, 3o fsr as the confidential codes pre concerned, it may be joaaible to arrange tliat certain at aiiy rate of these (other i'orei^pi Office ooii$4) should be left with the Indian officer v?Iio is in chcTge of the office in the Political Agents- v. Agent's absence; but this is a minor ooint, and the real difficulty is no doubt, the uncertain value of information received from an official of relatively inferior status, and the impossibility - of reposing the complete confidence in his appreciation of a situation which could be given in the case of a responsible Political Officer of standing. But all these considerations will already be fully present to the Governrnant of India ana the Political Hesident, iSa) L- 0— — &gt;' ■ MfiT Any further ecunmuniention should he addressed to— The Secretary of the Admiralty, London, S.W. ] Sir, L.P.—No. 8. / A &lt;hnh ally, &gt;V.

Consequently I think that permission to proceed on recess Ast real booh on the Political Agent would not prove injurious to Government interests. I therefore heg to recommend that a hot weather recess for the Political Agent, runrit, whenever the exigencies of the service permit# may he sanctioned* As regards the length of recess, I heg to suggest that the maximum period of the Political Agent's absence from his post shouldshould ha fixed three norths. 7nis is the period sanctioned for , 413 c*r ; 9 end nould practically coincide vith the period away if the Political Agent were allowed two months in India as are ohe Political officers at Bahrain and Bunder Abbas, because it would take the Political Agent some ten or twelve days to get to India. Perhaps it will not he out of place here to suggest that tk trie period of recess might he made the same for all the appoint ments for which it is sanctioned and fixed at three months; this would secure uniformity, and in any case as the voyage from Bahrain to India t o kes about ten days, and one possibly cannot get a steamer exactly st the time when two months in India has been completed, the difference is only tv.o or three days one way or the other, and, I think immaterial. In regard to the place at which the Political Agent should spend his recess, I suggest ^ny place in India within forty- eight hours of Karachi as is allowed for the other officers enjoying the privilege of recess; hut I would also suggest as an alternative that now that the overland route from Baghdad has been establish ad and working .veil, the Political Agent might he permitted, if he so desires, to proceed to the Lebanon for his recess, provided that the Government is put to no more expense than would be the case if he want to India. Should ^ this he granted the Political Agent would be able to enjoy a little over two months in a perfect climate, and he m telegra phic touch with Kuwait and with politics of Syria and T Irag which are hound up with those of Kuwait. Under present condi tions the journey takes considerably under a week, as follows :- From Kutwait to Basrah 12 hours, Basrah to Baghdad (by ordinary tr in) 36 hours, Baghdad to Damascus 24 hours; Damascus/to Lebanon few; hours, total (say) four to five days; a considerably shorter time than it would take to get to Karachi.
