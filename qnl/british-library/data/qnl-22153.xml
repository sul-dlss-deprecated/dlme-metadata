The French Sloop 'Bougainville”, flying the Flag of Contre Amiral Rivet, Officer Commanding, Levant Station, arrived on a visit to Bahrain on the 14th February. In the evening the Admiral and several Officers came to tea at the Agency and were taken for a drive and shown round the bazaar by the Assistant Political Agent in the absence of the Political Agent on tour. They all appeared to be voracious readers of Arabian travel books and nearly all talked English.' (ii). On the 15th February the Assistant Political Agent called upon the Admiral on board the 'Bougainville', which was gaily decorated with washing of an intimate nature. On landing the Admiral inspected a Guard of Honour at the Customs Pier and a salute of thirteen guns was fired. He then called on His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ! Isa A1 Khalifah at the Palace. His Excellency returned the Admiral’s call, in accordance with custom, at the Agency. (iii)• The Assistant Political Agent entertained the Admiral and four Officers of the Ship at luncheon at the Agency and afterwards took them to the Oil Field where they were shown drilling operations in which they were very interested as this was their first visit to an Oil Field. On their return they met the Political Agent who had come back from tour that after- noon. (iv). To anticipate the next report, the Admiral held a luncheon party on board the 'Bougainville' on the 16th and sailed for Bushire on the same afternoon. At the entrance to the Admiral’s dining room was a framed copy of the Carte Gastronomique of the Ecu de France! (v). H.M.S Fov/ey saluted the Admiral’s Flag when passing the 'Bougainville' and the latter replied. The usual calls were exchanged.3 (vi)• It is understood that the French sailors requested an old man, who goes out to ships to sell things, to find women for them at Milch he was deeply affronted. On their arrival on shore they aired their knowledge of the English language by demands for !, Drrrink? Women?”! They were told that the former was prohibited: but it Is understood that their other require ments were supplied. The populace seemed to be much diverted. 21 . TBUCIAh COAST . CD. Has al K-haimah . (a) . The ”Bougainville” visited Ras al Khaimah on her way to Bahrain. The Shaikh of Has al ^-haimah did not come on board, but met the Admiral on the beach with some five hundred follow ers. The following conversation,as recounded by the Admiral, is not without humour and is also possibly an useful Indication of the Shaikh’s state of mind:- Shaikh: Are you British or French? Admiral: I am French? Shaikh (hopefully): Are you at war with the British? Admiral: No, we are friends. Shaikh: Have you any arms: will you give me some? Admiral: I have arms for my Ship, but none to give away. Shaikh: Well - will you sell me some? The Admiral led the Political Agent to infer that he had not sold his arms to the Shaikh. (b) . An individual who was sent to Has al Khaimah for that purpose reports that eight Officers and a Somali Interpreter landed at Has al Khaimah. He confirms that the Shaikh met the party on the beach with horses and took them to his Fort. They were there for about one and an half hours and tea and coffee /wasXi. y / 4. was served* The Shaikh then told two of his nephews to take the party round the bazaar. The returned to the Fort to say good bye to the Shaikh, who is rumoured to have given them a letter in which (so it is presumed locally) he asked them to arrange for a geologist to see if fresh water can be had at Has al Khaimah. This fits in with a wish expressed by the Shaikh in November 1934 for an examination of the hills behind Has al Khaimah for water and oil. (c). H.M.S Bideford called at Tunb Island in response to a signal from the lighthouse keeper and reported that on the 29th December 1934, the Shaikh of Has al &amp;haimah had sent to Tunb Island a man, Nasir, who removed his flag and flagstaff. The Residency Agent, Sharjah, was ordered by the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to enquire from the Shaikh the reason for his extraordinary action. The enquiries are proceeding and the matter is under the consider ation of His Majesty’s Government. (S )• Abu Dhabi . On the 8th February the Political Agent arrived at Abu Dhabi in H.M.S Fowey.

On the 14th February the Political Agent visited Abu Musa Island in H.M.S Fowey to see the Company*s Mining Engineer, who had just arrived in order to start mining operations. 22. BAHRAIN . (a) . The old standing ill-feeling between the Sunnis and Shi*ahs (Baharinah) of Bahrain has again become acute and the latter put forward a number of x-&gt;olitical demands, some reason able and others of an extravagant nature and started open agitation in support of them. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin * Isa A1 Khalifah had already had under consideration certain 7 measures designed to improve the position of his Baharinah subjects and this policy will be pursued, though the leaders have been warned, both by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad and by the Political Agent, that they will be held personally responsible for any breach of the peace and the agitation has subsided. (b) . Elections to the Manamah Municipal C ounC il were held on the 12th, 13th and 14th February.

Reports have been received that Ring Bin Sa ! ud is pressing the California Arabian Standard 311 Company to land their material at Ras i'anurah and that the Sa'udi Minister of Finance will go into this question with the Company’s represent ative during his forthcoming visit to the Hasa Coast.

On the 24th March he received a demand from. Kajjli 1 Abdul Nabi al Bashir1, a Persian subject residing in Bahrain, for the repayment of an old debt of Rs.900/-.

Later / f Abdullah3 / ( 3 ) ’Abdullah al Qusaibi took Haj.li ’Abdul Nabi to task for writing to Hamad Sulaiman bin Hamdan and said ft you cannot get the money and no one will recover it for you because Hamad Sulaiman is a delegate of His Majesty King Bin Sa’ud** H&amp;jji ’Abdul Nabi is said to have replied that he was a Persian subject under the protection of the Political Agent and that if he did not receive the money the same day (S4th March), he would file a suit against Hamad Sulaiman in the Agency Courts* At this stage one Ahmad bln ’Abdullah al Dosari intervened and arranged a compromise for Rs.300/-.

That transit dues on overside delivery should be abolished, (iii). That transit dues on goods landed and re-shipped should be reduced, and (iv) • That the tt Ahmedl Tf incident should not be repeated. (2) . After several discussions the Bahrain Representatives, on the grounds of ancient friendship, agreed?- (a) that goods up to the value of two lakhs of rupees annually for King Bin Sa’ud’s personal use would be passed through free, provided the Bahrain Government received a communication from the Sa’udi Government Informing them that the goods were for the King, (b) that the concession of overside delivery from steameTs which had hitherto been limited to consignments of 1,000 bags or over would be reduced to 100 bags, and (c) that the n Ahmedi n incident would not recur.4. • I (3) * The Sa f udi Hepresentatives also asked that manifests, should be Issued to all dhows going to Sa ! udi ports from Bahrain and that the duty on Hasa dates should be revised. The Bahrain Representatives agreed that manifests would be Issued on a basis of reciprocity, and that the duty on Hasa dates would be levied at 5% ad valorem on dates entering Bahrain and 2fo ad valorem on dates shipped through Bahrain. This latter repre sents a big concession since the existing duties were fixed some ten years ago. The tentative settlement arrived at appears to have satisfied the Sa^dl Representatives. ( 4 ) . Hamad Sulaiman bin Hamdan was summoned urgently to the mainland and left for ^ubail on the 20th March. He returned to Bahrain on the 22nd. It is understood that the reason for his going to the mainland was an apprehension that the delegation^ telegraphic communications were being tampered with in Bahrain. (5) .

The occupants of the launch informed Mr. Barnett, the representative of the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company Limited, who was working on the Island, that they were merchants and were on their way to Dibai from Longah, and asked him if they could be of any assistance.

ABU DHABI . Mr. F.T.Cox, a geologist of the Anglo-Persian On Company Limited, visited Abu Dhabi from the 6th to ±6th March to examine the possibility of finding artesian water for the Shaikh. Mr. Cox found the Shaikh very apathetic. His attitude was that there had been plenty of rain this year and there was no shortage of water and in consequence did not require anyone to search for water for him. The Shaikh, however, arranged for Mr, C 0 x to visit one or two places in the interior of the principality. The result of his examin ation confirms Mr. Cox* previous opinion that there is little chance of finding water at shallow depths. £0. METEOROLOGICAL .

RECREATIONAL CENTRE TO BAHRAIN. 1* Trie communique regarding the evacuation of Hen jam and Basidu and the transfer of the Naval Recreational Centre to Bahrain was issued on tne 4th April. Bad weather delayed the arrival.of tne four Sloops which comprise the Persian Gulf Division. 2. Prior to the evacuation of Henjam and Basidu the Senior Naval Officer’s Staff Officer, Lieutenant-Commander Hewitc, came to Bahrain to make preliminary arrangements ashore, and to buoy the passage to the anchorage in Khor Kaliyah and erect beacons. This latter work could not be initiated until the communique was issued. H.M.S Bideford and H.M.5 Lupin arrived outside the channel into Khor Kallyah on the 9th April, and completed the construction of the beacons commenced by Lieutenant-Commander Hewitt. H.M.S Lupin moved into Khor Kaliyah on the 10th April. H.M.S Bldeford returned to Basidu* 5 .

A ceremoni&amp;l march past was to have been held on the 15th April, preceeded by official calls, but was cancelled in view of the disaster which occurred on the 14th April and which is reported in detail below. 5. In connection with the evacuation of Henjaa much assistance was rendered to the Persian duif Division by The Bahrain Petroleum Company limited who provided a large number of sacks to facilitate the moving of coal from Henjam and Basidu. These sacks were taken away by H.M.S Bideford on the early morning of the 1st April. In addition The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited rendered much assistance in the erection of the flagstaff at Jufair by providing material for blasting a hole in the rock, and a motor lorry for general use on the 13th April, 6 . The more of the Naval Recreational Centre to Bahrain does not appear to have had any form of political repercussion within Bahrain* The Ruling Family appear to feel that it strengthens their position from outside aggression. Employ ment is being found for many out-of-works, and the meat, egg and chicken markets are enjoying an unprecedented turn over.

In reply to their demand, the ling is reported to have told them that if they considered that he was indebted to them, they should produce their books to the Sa f udi Audit Department for scru tiny.

It was reported that the Qusaibis are being pressed by the Sastern Bank Limited, Bahrain, to pay up a loan, and that a obtained a /letter/115 2 Letter from Bin Samuel to the ?oI. tica .

They told the Political Agent that Bin Salad’s fears regarding British aggression or peaceful penetration of Arabia were produced through advice from certain outsiders whose names they would not disclose. It is reported also tin t tae King has helped the Oukaibis with a loan of thr e lakhs of rupees. 3# Bin Sa, T ud is sa d to have ordered the replacement of the M.T dollar by the rupee as the unit of currency in his east ern dominions* It is said that hold sovereigns worth £.45,000 have been shipped to India from Sa*udi Arabia to purchase rupees. * In the meantime three merchants, two of whom are British subjects, have been given permission to export dollars free of any customs impost.

He inf or me cl the Political Agent that he was proceeding to Baghdad for medical treaternent. The Shaikh f s journey from Abu Dhabi to Bahrain occupied eight days. The fact that his usual source of funds (Ahmad bin iChalaf, to whom ne owes much money) appears to have dried up # was accompanied by unverified complaints of exactions from Hindu merchants (the geese who lay the golden eggs for him) lends some doubt as to whether the Shaikhs visit to Baghdad was for purely medical reasons. The Shaikh is, however, a very sick man and suffering from chronic anaemia and the question of his successor is a topic of local conversation. His failure, however, to mention his prospective journey when H.H*S Shoreham visited him a few days before his departure or to ask for the usual letter of good offices’ gives reason for the above suspicion. If9. BAHRAIN. 1.

Xu is understood that tobacco will be cultivated on a large scale as well as English and Indian vegetables. It is understood tnat certain local merchants intend entering into pc*rtnership witn a view to starting an ice manu— facturing plant. The present plant is inadequate to su ply local requirements and any project to increase the supply of ice during the summer months deserves sympathetic consideration.

(iv) Doctor Blegvad said that several countries had offered to take up his fish enquiring work, but that the Iranian Minister concerned had decided on Denmark, because years ago he had seen the milk collecting system and had been deeply impressed by the honesty of a people who could leave cans of milk standing unguarded by the roadside.-5- Q§&gt; (v) Doctor Blegvad said that His Majesty the Shah had asked him whether it was possible to establish commercial fisheries in the Persian Gulf and that he had replied that it could be done if money was put into it.

Letters have been received from the minor Shaikh Hamad bin Sa'id and the leaders of the Naqbiyin tribe stating that the boy Hamad-3- b±n Sa'id has been elected by the people of Kalba as their Shaikh. Fo mention has been made of who is intended to act as Begent. ihe Shaikhs of Has al Khaimah, Sharjah and Unm al Qai- wain were warned not to interfere in the affairs of Kalba and trike any part in the choice of a successor to the late Shaikh and this warning has had effect in the case of the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Shaikh of SaBaabdaHOMOt-Umm al Qaiwain but it was reported that the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah left for on the 7th June. He passed close to the village of Dhaid where Khalid bin Aimad the ex-Shaikh of Sharjah had gathered a small force with a view to entering Kalba if he was asked to d o so by the people. This individual hoped that he would be successful m becoming Eegent but a peaceful attempt of his to enter Ka i^ some few days before was repulsed. The Shaikh of Ras al Khai- mah is reported to have endeavoured to enlist Khalid on his side but Khalid would have nothing to do with him. The Shaikh 01 Ras al Khaimah then proceeded with 12 followers to enter Kalba and this information was followed immediately by further news that Mohammad bin Ali, the leader of the Beni Kitab tribe who are in alliance with Khalid had declared themselves hostile to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah. The situation looks unplea sant for the Shaikh of Ras a1 Khaimah as the Beni Kitab are a bedouin tribe who can, if they wish, interpose themselves bet ween Kalba and Ras al Khaimah.

At the request of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain the Shaikh of Qatar was asked whether he would agree to a meeting between His Highness* close relatives and his own within the Qatar territory as a further endeavoui to settling this difficult question. This letter was despatched from the Agency and in the meantime the repres entatives of the Shaikh of Qatar present at Bahrain announcec tne fact tnah the negotiations were concluded unsuccessfully and presented a letter from the Shaikh of Qatar to the effect that he considered his undertaking not to interfere with Naim no longer binding on him as the negotiations had been terminated. The Honourable the Political Resident was immediately communicated with and pending a communication from him, the Qatar representatives were required to remain in Bahrain. On Wednesday the 23rd June a reply was received from the Shaikh of Qatar to the effect that he would be willing for the meeting proposed by His Highness the Siiaikh of Bahrain to take place within the Qatar territory. He suggested the village of Ghariyfch. This village is just northnorth of Doha. The Bahrain Government immediately got in touch with Qatar authorities and a meeting was arranged for Saturday, the 26th of June. Shaikh Abdullah bin ’ Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad accompanied by Mr. Belgrave, the Adviser, left for Ghariyah on Saturday the 26th. The Qatar representatives left Bahrain on Tuesday the 29th June and returned to Qatar. On the morning of Wednesday the 30th June, as no communication had been received from the Bahrain representatives and as a severe shamal had been blowing for several days the Agency Launch 'Felix Jones' was despatched to Ghariyah with letters for the Adviser and water in case the party were running short.

On the morning of July the 1st, a letter was received from the Ruler of Qatar to the effect that he intended to take action and restrain those alleged to be his subjects from violating the laws of the country. The same day it appears that the advance troops of the Shaikh of Qatar attacked the Fort at A1 Thaghab in which there were about 50 of the Naim. The Naim resisted the attack of the Shaikh of Qatar 1 s troops and there appears to have been a minor engagement between the Shaikh of Qatar f s troops and a small party of the Naim who were coming to the relief of those garrisoning the Fort at A1 Thaghab. Without much difficulty the Shaikh of Qatar*s Forces succeeded in reducing the Fort and in taking possession of the garrison. It appears that some five or six persons were killed on either side during this engagement. The engagement seems to have had an unfortunate effect on the morale of the Naim as immediately afterwards the;y sent representatives to the Shaikh of Qatar and sued for peace. The Shaikh of Qatar obtained a document from Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad of the Naim to the effect that they would observe the / laws3* laws of Qatar while they remained in the State and that in the event of their desiring to leave the State of Qatar they were in full liberty to do so» There was considerable excitement in Bahrain among the Ruling Family during the first few days of July while exaggerated rumours were coming from the Qatar Peninsula* There was no indication that it was likely that there would be any demonstration by the inhabitants of Bahrain in favour of the Naim and in actuality no such demonstration did take place. About the 6th of July the Shaikh of Bahrain determined to withdraw the pearling dhows from the pearling banks in case there should occur any incident between his dhows and those belonging to the Shaikh of Qatar. He was informed that there was no objection to this course of action and the dhows returned to Bahrain. The advent of such a large number of individuals without work might possibly have resulted in a pro-Naim demonstration but in fact no such demonstration took place. As soon as it became clear that affairs on the mainland had quietened down, the pearling fleet once more returned to the pearling banks. This was about the 9th or 10th of July. In the early days of the month before it was known what the situation in Subarah would be a few families, principally of the Bu Khwara tribe, took refuge in the Island and were suitably fed and accommodated by His Highness the Shaikh. The Shaikh asked for jA. written permission to allow the Naim to come to Bahrain if they so desired which was granted, but the Naim did not appear to desire to leave Qatar where they had sufficient grazing for their flocks which probably they would not have been able to obtain in Bahrain. Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad of the Naim interviewed the Political Agent on the 13th of July and stated generally as had been recorded above. It appears that the Shaikh of Qatar did not intend to disarm the Naim but only took a total of 90 rifles from the tribe. The Naim are not living in the ZubaraZubara area as the grazing for their flock has been used up and have moved further to the south to new grazing land* Shaikh Rashid bim Mohammad of the Naim stated that they were not suffering any hardship from the Shaikh of Qatar and in fact as soon as he had signed the above mentioned truce with the Shaikh of Qatar everything had been peaceful and the Shaikh of Qatar had been at some pains to see that any rifles which were inadvertently taken after the truce were returned* A number of tribesmen and their families from the smaller tribes such as the Bu Khwara have come over to Bahrain during the past 15 days. The number is between two and three hundred persons* They are either living in houses which they had owned previously at Muharraq or they are staying with their relatives and friends who live here. So far very few, if any, of the Naim have crossed over. &gt; , ' . • . • v His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain decided that in view of the recent events in Qatar he was not disposed to continue the transit due privilege which he had previously extended to the Shaikh of Qatar. This means that from the date of this praclamation, cargo in transit for Qatar will be required to pay the usual 5% duty as opposed to the previous privilege duty of 2%o Further His Highness the Haler of Bahrain has prohibited the entrance of Qatar subjects into Bahrain. 112 and 113.

POSITION IN THE ARABIAN GULF. BY A CORRESPONDENT FROM MUSCAT When the turn for Oil Concessions came. Rulers of Dubai and others raced to receive offers from the foreignex s before it vvas too late for them to lose the ' s \ booty. D ! Arcy Co. Limited in which The Anglo-Iranian Oxx. Co.Limited of Abadan is associated came forward and placed their otiers for option, and concluded Agreements with the Rulers for the payment of:- Es 3000/- per mensem to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi Es 1000/- per mensem to the Ruler of Dubai M 700/- per mensem to the Ruler of Sharjah 700/— per mensem to the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah is 500/- per mensem to the Ruler of Ajman. but the Ruler of Umm al Qaiwain did not come to an Agree ment up till now. This option was for a period of two years which will expire shortly. The Geological Survey Party had visited the respective places where it took them a period of 8 months exploiting and surveying the lands and preparing maps. Today they are ©camped at the last stage of Abu Dhabi and on Qatar boundary. As that the period of the option expires ere long and within which period they were not able to attain their object, they tried to extend the Agreement, but of no avail, it was accordingly decided that negotiations for Oil Concessions to commence with all the Rulers within the period of these two years. The Ruler of Dubai was first to be approached ggg and it was agreed that he should be paid an approximate sum of £ 4300/- for his grant of Oil Concession for whole of his territory and dependencies, and that he will have no future claim whatsoever excepting to receive a sum of is/-- 2 - Es 5/- per ton on discovery of Petrol or any other liquid minerals. They have hound him with difficult conditions which he accepted without giving the matter due consideration. One of which is that if any unforeseen incident occurs to any of the Company employees, the punishment, as and might ■^e considered necessary, will he levied hy and at the dis cretion of H.B.M ! s Government. This condition made the people to raise their objec tions and some whose hearts were brightened hy the Grace of God the Almighty explained j?he serious consequence of this condition, hence the completion of the Agreement was deferred for a period of eight months and Mr. Holmes, the negotiator and the Concessionaire of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited departed for the place.- He recently returned and found the position more acute than when he had left it. Has AL SHAWRA (The previous name of the Newspaper substituted by , AL SHABaB) to offer any advice to its breth ren and guide them to the right path in regard to the Condi tions of the Agreement. If so it should not hesitate. During the Geological Survey in the boundary of Abu Dhabi, there arrived in the Coast an Englishman, a Member of Parliament in London, for the purpose of fighting locusts. This gentleman toured whole of the Trucial Coast traversing deserts and barren lands exploiting the territories where locusts lay their eggs. God only knows what was the object of his visit. Were his efforts to hunt locusts or to hunt us ourselves? AL SHABAB . They have hunted you through your Rulers and there is no necessity therefore to hunt you all individually. Our advice to you is that you should get in touch with the Newspapers of the Arabic World and they will publish and c irculate your complaints, feelings and the tyrannies you&lt;S) -3- are put into.

In Palestine which is in the heart of the civilised world similar acts or even worst are happenings of which you have already heard, especially during this year. I am therefore glad to be able to get in touch with the outside world where I am at safety* This des cription is adequate enough to make you understand of what is being caused to your brothers the Arabs in this world especially b w the British. With regard to what has happened in the Gulf in the absence of AD SRAWBA Newspaper, I may briefly enumerat«MK hereunder :u.ny of the Incidents# 2he Arabian Coast represents six large and smaller States bound v.ith Government by conventions# When Braiisi ¥;as under the control of fl Saud their influence extended to these six territories and others. Some of these Sheikhdoms, due to religious and creed relationship submit to Saudis up till now. The Emarets were on the best possible terms with Saudis till the conclusion of Jeddah convention with its clause 6. Some were under the impression that this convention was signed under obligatory circumstances, and they therefore remained under the former friendly connexions awaiting an opportunity. The situation of the Sheikhs towards Britain was well known# Similar to what hap. ened to the Euler of has 1 Knai- mail about whoa a mention was made at h~4 ShhVhw. at the time* 'When the Iranians drove away the British from their country and compelled them to change their Air bine route from the Iranian littoral. Thereafter they came to the Coast of Oman and negotiated with the Emirs for the construc tion of a handing Ground and a Post Office. The attitude of the Sheikh of Has ai Khaimah was under stood and so the British Government left ^him and approached the Euler of Dubai to whom, they offered an approximate sum of £ 10000 /-, but this offer was put down. Subsequently s Government approached the Sheikh of Dubai through the medium of Sheikh Ahmed Jabtr Al Sabah, Euler of Kuwait, &amp; friend and a lover of the British more than a Britisher to British But the Kuler of Kowsit failed in his attempt and returned b ck to his home* Within this time the Beside cy Agent arranged secretly | with the Sheikh of Sharjah to call upon the other Sheikhs in order to arrive at an agreement with then. He actually wrote to them and they visited him, but when the news w. re circulated4 to his brothers * nd Ms subjects ell in one tone opposed his actions. However incidents lengthy to describe occurred, but it ended v.ith the success of the Euler of Sharjah through the assistance of the British and the intrigues of their sup porters who are now repenting for their doings* The Agreement was then concluded and the Euler of Shar j&amp;h received £ 2000/- per annum as rent for the aerodrome in his country, thus he has opened the gate of the Coast for Bri tish who attained their object* The Emir Ms repented for hat he has done for the sake of the pounds (£), but at the same time he is enjoying his booty which he successfully ac quired. Some of the Arabs of Sharjah immigrated to Has al Khaip&amp;h on account of what has befallen it i.e* Colonisation* Many prominent persons including the ex Viceroy of India passed through this aerodrome* On the occasion of the arrival of the ex Viceroy of India, the place was beflagged thus those territories have become a British Colony* and the Emirs assembled together and guns were fired andSDCKBT No.13 of 1937.

(i) The rumour in the town is that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company^ operations in Saudi Arabia are not progressing too well, and in fact that a deadlock has arisen between the Saudian Government and the Company. The Saudian Government are apparently annoyed by the Com pany’s failure to export oil within the period contracted and by the nonfulfilment of the obligation that the Com pany should invariably employ Saudi Arabs except where highly technical skill is required. The Company argue that they are unable to find competent persons of Saudi national ity in sufficient numbers, that they cannot construct ^ sto rage tanks for oil until a jetty has been built, and that they do not see why they should meet the whole cost of the jetty when the Saudian Government expect it to be free and open for all. It is believed here that other companies must have made offers to the Saudian Government and that the Government therefore c onsider they are in a good posi tion to demand their full pound of flesh from the Califor- nia Arabian Standard Oil Company or even more. Mr. Ohliger the Company’s Manager, left on the 9th November for Riyadh to see the King in this connection. (ii) Petroleum Concessions Limited have started work again in Qatar. A party of two g eologists, one driller and a wireiess expert left for Dohah on the 8th November to fix sites for oil and water wells and to arrange for the erection of a camp to accommodate the personnel which will be employed later.
