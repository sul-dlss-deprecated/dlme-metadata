I am Sir Your obedient Servant The Under Secretary of State India OfficeK 677/677/234. P.Z. 1334 FORIJGN Ic^fcQ. J S. W.1. 1st March, 1940. Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to refer to Treasury letter H 27816 of the 2nd February, 1939, concerning the Vice-Consulate at Abadan Reach and to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, that, in view of the fact that the recent adjustment of the Iran-Iraq boundary has brought Abadan Reach within the territorial limits of Iran, it is proposed to place this office, which has heretofore been under the superintendence of His Majesty’s Consulate at Basra, under the superintendence of the Consulate at Ahwaz. Although His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr will remain as titular Vice-Consul at Abadan Reach, the latter post will be maintained as a Shioping Office distinct from Khorramshahr. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in a letter of the 13th December last of which an extract is enclosed, has made certain financial proposals wnich have necessitated the reconsideration of the office allowance assigned to the post. A statement of a proposed new allowance prepared in this department is enclosed. 2. It will be observed that His Majesty’s Minister suggests increases in salary for both Indian clerks. Lord Halifax considers tne higher salaries proposed to be fully justified; in the case of the senior, in view of his promotion to the rank of pro-Consul, and in that of the second clerk, who has received no increase since his apnointment in 1936, as a reward for his satisfactory services. Payment of both/ The Secretary to the Treasury.both clerks in rupees is considered as desirable; in view of the Iranian currency restrictions the clerks desire to receive their salaries in free exchange and His Majesty’s Minister is of the opinion that there is some danger of their resigning, with consequent breakdown of the office, if this privilege is not conceded. 3. Their Lordships will observe that, in addition to increases for the clerks, the appointment of a second messenger is proposed, as also a uniform allowance for both messengers. For the reasons advanced by His Majesty’s Minister, Lord Halifax regards these proposals as desirable and approves their adoption. The messengers will be paid in Iranian currency. 4. In conformity with the existing practice whereby expenditure incurred in maintaining Diplomatic and Consular establishments in Iran is shared with the Government of India, that government will be requested to meet a moiety of the expenses of the post, while the revenues of the post will be shared equally with the Government of India. 5. I am to draw to Their Lordships’ attention the generous offer of Captain Napier, the Vice-Consul in charge of the post, to forego £150 of his allowance for supervision of the office as a contribution to the State during the war. However, this generous gesture, which offsets the proposed increased expenditure may not be emulated by his successor should he be replaced during the course of hostilities. 6. I am to express the hope that Their Lordships may be moved to give apnroval for the contemplated changes and to sanction the assignment to Abadan Reach as from the 1st April, 1H40, wnen it is suggested that the changes should take effect, of/of the office allowance detailed in the enclosed statement, and composed of £100 plus 8,400 Indian rupees plus 13,100 rials, subject to the Government of India accepting a moiety. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) A. B. HUTCHECcopy (K 677/677/254) (670/ll/o9) P.Z. 1334 1940 j Extract from letter 670/11/59 from Tehran Chancery to Co n sular Department deted the ll ; ?th Decembeft D The financial problems which have unfortunately delayed our reply concern the payment of the clerks* salaries, and the taking and remittance of fees, in the face of the Iranian currency regulations* After discussing with Gardener, who has consulted with Napier at Khorramshahr, the question of how to levy fees and pay the salaries of the two Indian clerks, to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government and without imposing hardships on these almost indispensable people, we have at last worked out what we feel is the best proposal. With regard to fees we agree with Gardener and Napier that the best course would be to continue the present arrangements taking advantage of Note 5 to Annex 2, Chapter IX of Consular Instructions which says that feee 'are to be paid in money which is legal tender or current in the locality where the payment is made'* The clients of the shipping office are the Oil Company and Messrs* F*0*Strick and Company, v^ho would continue to pay a lump sum in Iraqi Dinars quarterly in Basra for the fees they have incurred during that period* It would only remain for His Majesty's Consul at Basra to show the fees in his account as a credit on behalf of Khorramshahr. The oil Company, for whose benefit the shipping office is primarily maintained, would presumably be content with this arrangement as they are bound to the official rial /rate Consular Depart aent, Foreign office.rate of exchange and obtain their dinars vith ease* Messrs* F*0*StricK and Company might possibly infringe the local law by obtaining rials at the black rate and then demand the right to pay consular fees in rials at the official rate of 80 » £l, which is still adhered to in all other consulates in Iran* on the other hand as no such attempt has yet been made although Abadan Reach has been Iranian territory for some time f the danger seems remote* Moreover the fees collected from this company amount to only about 7 of the total receipts* A great advantage of the collection of fee© in free currency abroad is that it avoids the necessity of paying salaries in rials in order to dispose of rial receipts* We feel that it ie advisable to pay the two Indian clerks in rupees (as at ihorramshahr) or in dinars (as in the past) for several reasons* The most important is that they infinitely prefer to have free exchange in India, and that unless they are content there is the danger that they may resign, causing • he breakdown of the office. Since the machinery for payment in rupees in India already exists at Khorramshahi' there should be no difficulty over this point* The enclosed statements A and B prepared by Gardener and Napier show a comparison between the present and the proposed budget for Abadan Reach, one or two items of which require some explanation* Captain Napier has offered to reduce his allowance for the supervision of the office by gl&amp;O per ar:num. This offer is made as a contribution to the State during the present crisis, in view of the reliance which he can place on the head clerk. He recommends however, and Gardener agrees, that Mr. Tulwar, who has been the head clerk of the shipping office for fifteen years and has received only two increases of pay, /eacheach of I*D* 36 per annum# ehould be granted the rank of p’o Consul and that his pay be increased from I.D. 34S per annum (equivalent to Rupees 399 per mensem) to Rupees 460 per mensem. He has always been very efficient and reliable and hie services at the present time, owing to his thorough knowledge of shipping work and his skill in handling men, are of great value. His promotion to the rank of Pro Consul would give him greater authority in dealing with both masters and seamen and would add considerably to his dignity among the Indians. The second clerk who is also well worth his salt is recount ended for an increase of salary from I.D* 180 per annum (equivalent to Rupees 210 per mensem) to Rupees 260 per mensem. As regards office messengers, the former establishment was one of I.D. *±6 per annum. One has been found to be quite insufficient and the second clerk has frequently had to do this work himself with consequent lose of efficiency. When the fence now being erected along the waterfront is finished, distances from the office to ships will be Increased and a second messenger will become all the more necessary* Napier proposes and Mr. Gardener agrees, that two farrashes at Rials 300 and Rials 260 per month respectively be provided for. Apparently no provision has been made in the past for uniforms for the messenger. An allotment of Rials 600 is suggested to provide the two proposed farrashes with uniforms in accordance with local practice In Iran. The former provision for sundries was I.D. , oOO fils. It is now proposed that Rials 800 should be allotted in the new budget to this account, as postal and telegraph charges will presumably be met by the Foreign Office in the me normal way and no budgeting for them is necessary. ,v&gt;/. r -2, pi 0 . ^ A^j In any further communicatifih on this subject, please quote | \«4 irn »w &gt; 1*Wn4 ,« ,r*, / ^ No. K and address —not to any person by name, but to— “ I'^xTrider-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, iQXQ &amp; le | * 1843 f“ n, S.'W. i. ^ THE Under-Secretary of Skto ^ 4^kgiJAffairs presents his compliments to JUL^vsj^lu^ O 1 ^ ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop ns P of the under-mentioned paper. £&gt; Foreign Office, , 193b .

Jt n ' r&gt;4^ * i C OBFID I'SJI AL. 29th January,19S8 I have the honour to infoxrta you that I have recently hah under conaideration the positio/i with regard to the British Vice-Consulate.Abadan Reach. 2. As you are aware,the poet of Ris Majesty*s Vice- Consul, Abadan Reach,is held by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr. But the two posts are quite distinct,the post of Vice-Consul,Abadan Reach being in all respects subordinate to His Majesty’s Consulate at Basra. $he Iranian Government have,however,no official Knowledge of the existence of this separate post. To them the office of this Vice-Consulate is simply the shipping office of His Majesty’s Vice-consulate at iChorramshahr.maintained at Abadan for the convenience of British shipping using that port. i'his anomalous arrangement has worked adequately during the past five years,and no diffi culty has been made by the Iranian Government. The position is,however,inevitably delicate,and it is always possible that it may give rise to trouble. The circumstances which gave rise to the present unusual arrangement.namely that shipping at Abadan lay in Iraqi waters,will disappear when Iraq has ratified the recent frontier settlement. It therefore seemed that it might be desirable to review the existing arrangements and consider whether the shipping office at Abadan should not be made an integral part of His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Khorramshahr and thus subordinate to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz. As a further possible reason fer rjlIiJLng this change, it appeared from the information available that the shipping / companies’companies 1 practice in paying the shipping office fees in Iraqi dinars at Basra might he an infringement of the Iranian exchange law and that they ought to he paid in Iran in rials. I therefore decided to consult His K&amp;jesty's Embassy at BaghdadjOnd Kis Majesty's Consul at Basra regarding the desir ability or otherwise of abolishing the separate post of British Vioe-Consulate,Abadan Beach and amalgamating the shipping office with Hie Majesty's Vice-Consulate at Khorram- shahr. 3. Mr. 0. Scott while in charge of Eis Majesty’s Embassy at Baghdad informed rae that both and Eis Majesty's Consul at Basra shared my view that it was desirable to terminate the existing arrangements as soon as possible. Mr. Bricicell explained that the accounting arrangements for the Vice-Consulate,Abadan Beach involved considerable work and expense which could be avoided if the suggested change were made. He would therefore welcome the change. With regard, however,to the exchange position,my enquiries showed that there was no infringement of the Iranian law,at least so far as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were concerned, fhe fees paid by that Company,which form by far the greater part of those collected by the Abadan shipping office,are paid from their foreign exchange allotment and are accou ted for to the Iranian Oovernment. Thus there Is no necessity to make the suggested change on this ground. Further,consideration of the actual administrative changes involved in amalgamating the shipping office with His Majesty's Vice-consulate at Khorramshahr,shewed that the position was greatly complicated by the fact that His Majesty's Vice-consulate is subordinate for administrative purposes to the political Resident in the Persian Gulf and staffed and organised on Indian lines, in view of the possibility of changes in this respect taking /placeplace in the fairly near future,there would he advantages in postponing any changes In the existing arrangements at Ahad&amp;n Reach until the general reorganisation takes place. I would therefore suggest for your consideration that it might be decided in principle that the existing arrangements should be terminated,but that the reorganisation should be postponed for the present. The position migfet,however,be reviewed from time to time,as for instance when tne frontier settlement has been ratified by Iraq. 4.

With reference to your telegram No*3 of December 21 regarding the irregular levy of fee No*96 at the Vice-Consulate at Abadan Reach, I have the honour to report as follov/s:- On November 5 Captain Bazalgette, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr addressed a circular letter to the various Shipping firms at Abadan to the effect that in future the shipping Office ?/ould close on Fridays and open on Sundays. This was brought to my attention about December 5. I asked Captain Bazalgette whether there was any authority or precedent for this change and as he said there was not I requested him to report the matter in an official despatch copy of which I enclose herewith. On the receipt of your telegram No.3 f conxiunicated th&lt; contents to Captain Bazalgette, who thereupon gave the necessary instructions that the Shipping Office would only close on December 24 and 25 and January 1 as in past years. I explained to him that no changes in office hours should be made until I had obtained a decision from you on the subject. I enclose herewith copies of a despatch and of a semi-official letter from him explaining the reasons why he had proposed to close the office from December 24 - January 1* It will be noted that he only followed the practice instituted by his predecessor, which presumably was never reported to this office or to you. In /In vie\7 of Captain Bazalgette* a representations I have the honour to reconmend that the necessary sanction may he given for the Shipping office to close on Fridays instead of Sundays and to observe all Iranian gazetted holidays* I have etc., (Signed) D.F.H.Brickellcopy , (K 1411/1411/293) NO* 513/1 British Consular Shipping Office f Abadan Heaeh, 31st December, 1936, Dear Brickell* Would you please refer to your D.O*Letter No*2379 of the 23rd December, 1936 and our conversations regarding the Holidays of the Abadan Shipping Office? I enclose two memoranda giving my point of view and opinions and hope you will agree with me. I think X should point out that my position as Vice- Consul at Khorramshahr and Vice-Consul at Abadan Reach is probably unique. The Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr under the supervision of the Consul at Ahr/az is recognised by the Iranian Government and his district includes Abadan* Prom the Iranian point of view, the Abadan Chipping Office is a branch of the Khorramshahr Vice-Consulate, to facilitate the internal routine of British ships”, and that that office is subordinate to you is unknown to them* It is to be noted, too, that for administrative purposes the Khorramshahr office is subordinate to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and] the Government of India, and therefore, observes the holidays gazetted by the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (Signed) J.E.A*Bazalgette D.P.H.Brickell, Esq., His Majesty’s Acting Consul, Basra.32 No* 614/1 British Consular Shipping Office, Abadan Reach, 51st December, 1956 Prom:- The British Vice-Consul, British Consular Shipping Office, Abadan Reach* To:- His Majesty’s Acting Consul, British Consulate, Basrah. Friday is the Official Holiday in Iran and all Government Offices, Banks and Firms, whether Iranian or Foreign, close on Fridays. I think I am right in saying that British Consular Offices close too on that day* Certainly the Consulate- General at Bushire and the Consulates at Kerman and Bandar Abbas do* Ho v ever It is more convenient for British Subjects to consult me at the Khorramshahr Vice-Consulate on their private affairs on their weekly holiday rather than on a working day.Also as the Indian and Buahire Mail arrives on Thursday, by working on Friday, it can be asnwered by return post* My Xhorramshahr Office therefore remains open on Fridays. This is purely an arrangement for the convenience of the British Subjects and the efficiency of that Office. S. Abadan is in practice a private port of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, and the Iranian authorities allow no passengers or goods, other than for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, to land there. The ships dealt with in the Abadan Ship ing Office are tankers loading Oil Fuels and Merchant ships belonging /mmmm belonging to or chartered by Messrs. Prank C* Strick bringing nateriel for the ,4nglo-lranian Oil Company. The Abadan Shipping Office deals with no ships unconnected with the oxglo-Iranian Oil Company. 3* Ships however» do not observe holidays or office hours and between 4 &amp; 6 ships arrive at or leave Abadan daily# Fridays and Sundays included. The work is so heavy that I d:&gt; not think there Is a holiday in the year on which the services of the Shipping Office are not called for# and the working days are few on which these services are not required after office hours. In fact the situation is such that it is not a question of which day the clerks will have a complete holiday# but on which day Fee No.96 will be charged in what would otherwise be 'Office Hours”. Following are the sums collected during 1936 (other than under Fees 95 and 96) on Fridays and on Sundays# which shows that there is but little difference betv/een the pressure of work on either day bearing in mind that the amount collected on Sundays is for Urgent Work and that collected on Fridays is for routine work:- J|UNpA^£3. 443*16.6. PKIDAYS . £94.13.0. 4. A fair consideration should# I think# be given to the clerks. If they work on Fridays when the Anglo-Irani an Oil Company Offices are closed and routine work is slack they may well be wasting their time# with little work other than urgent matters to deal with whereas on their dunday holiday they may be called upon for urgent work and find it to be routine. Again on their Sunday holiday their friends are at work. If they take a Friday holiday# they will not be called upon except for urgent matters /matters since the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Offices are closed and further they are able to make that kind of personal friendship with the Company’s staff which goes a long way to smo th over the minor difficulties which may well arise between Government servants and servants of a large firm. I am of opinion, therefore, that the Abadan Shipping Office should be closed on Fridays and if you have no objection, I propose continuing this arrangement.

When the duties of the Acting British Vice-Consul, Abadan Reach were performed by the Assistant Port Officer, the Iraq Government gazetted holidays were observed* These, as regards Christmas, were Christmas day, Boxing Day and New year’s Day* 2# On the transfer of the Shipping Office to the shore in February, 1933 and the appointment of the Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr as Vice-Consul, Abadan Reach, subordinate to the Consul at Basrah, the custom arose for the Shipping Office to conform to the Khorramshahr Vice-Consulate hours. 3. As the Shipping Office is in no way administered by the Government of India but by the Consul at Basrah, I can see no justification for this. However Christmas Holidays on the Indian Scale i.e. 24th December to 1st January were observed in 1934 and 1935 and fee No*96 was charged without complaint by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 4, The following suras were collected under Fee No*96 in what would otherwise have been office hours on the days other than Official British Bank Holidays during the Christmas Holiday* 1934* 53*6*6* 1935* 55.14*0* Although /Although the sum Involved Is small I do not think it can he justified. The Shipping Office is for the convenience of British Shipping Companies and the nglo-iranian Oil Company and should, I consider, observe the Official Iranian Bank Holidays.

With reference to my despetch No*5 oi B’ehruary 15th enclosing a copy of a despatch to the Foreign Office about Consular shipping duties at Abaonn Reach, I enclose a copy of the reply that X have now received* V' ! ^.&gt;* 4 **.. ■ 8* With regard to paragraph 2, I should be glad to learn whether an opportunity has oc curred of mention ing casually to the Governor of Abadan or any other local authority that it is proposed to establish a shipping office at badan. It would, I think, be a good thing to do so if a natural opening occurs, and anything like secrecy or mystery should of course be rigorously avoided, but I doubt whether it is necessary to create an opportu ity or to seek permission* 2m This does not mean that I am not prep: red for Persian objections. We told the Foreign Office at the outset that the Persians might object, but that that was no reason for not making the experiment, as the worst that could happen would be that the experiment might have to be discontinued* 4. I think our best course is to proceed as if we thought (and are sure the Persians will think) that what we are doing is the most natural thing in the world - this, not as a matter of tactics but because it a perfectly natural thing, subject to the important condition that I makd H.B.D.Bybbon-inonypenny, Ksq.» His Majesty’s Consul, Ahwazmake below. The moat likely Persian objection is to the Vice-Consul at Mohanuaerah having 'two posts'* This is a point about which the Protocol Department are very fussy, but it has nothing whatever to bo with the political problem of the Shatt-el-Arab frontier. In any case, I am quite confident that the practical convenience of the arrangement is sufficiently natural to absolve ue of any charge of disingenuous proceedings* y condition is this* hatever Lincoln does on Persian soil he must do, vis-A-vis the Persian authorities, on the authority oi his position as Vice-Consul at fetohammerah. It is no concern of the ersian authorities whom Lincoln may have consulted or iroa whom he may have received orders, on matters which have no inter national aspect whatsoever, before tacing action. The action is his (subject to the supervision of yourself and the Legation). It is consequently no concern of the Persian authorities how many instructions incoln receives from Selous, still less that he remits to him his lees and accounts. That is a purely 'internal concern of the Vice- Consulate', to use a ohrase of which the Persians are very t ond 5, But if Selous were to come to Abadan anct ta&gt;&lt;e over the direction of some case, a very different position would arise and one to which the Persians would rightly take the strongest exception. My concurrence in the performance of these duties by Lincoln from a shore office at Abaaan has all along been given on the understanding that nothing of the sort should happen: and I had hoped that my despatches, especially my despatch No.70 had made this abundantly clear. 6. Fortunat- ly, the difficulty is likely to be more theoretical than real. I do not know much about shipping workwork, but I gather that &amp;ost of it ie of a routine nature i that caees in which the Persian authorities could becoiiie involved are likely to be very few. If a difficult case arose in which a visit to a vessel lying in the stream were necessary, there is no reason why Selous and Lincoln should not sect on board the vessel in question. Selous would never have entered Persian territory and his movements in ’Iraq territory have nothing to do with the Persian authorities. But in the unlikely event of Lincoln having subsequently to make any commu nication to the Persians, he would have to make the oomnunication in his own name. Of course, if a sailor gets into trouble while on shore, that is not a '’shipping' question at all, but one with which Lincoln would aed in his normal capactiy. 7. When is the arrangement lifeely to £tert anu h'.ve you come to any decision with Selous and Lincoln as to the designation of the offleeV (8gd) R.H.aOARK,Copy Copy (5 6323/^90/298} 4695 L PRKIGN OFPICK 9 S.W.l. 8th June, 19o2. &gt;:y dear Ho a re, &amp;!any thanks for your letter of l ay 5th (807/1-7} about the consular shipping duties at Abadan Reach. The projected arrangement by which Lincoln is to take on the work cannot of course be introduced until sanction hae been obtained from the Treasury for the office at Abadan. Before asking for this we had been waiting to hear whether the possible objections of the Persian Government would rule the scheme out altogether; but as you have apparently decided not to go out of your way to sound them on this point beforehand, we are now writing to the Treasury and will of course let you know the result as soon as we can. So far as any subsequent discussions with the Persian authorities are concerned, we are quite ready to leeve it to you to present the matter as you think best* In particular we see no reason why you should mention Lincoln s relations with Basra and we do not mind what title is given to the office at Abadan. Having regard, however, to the legisla tion under which consuls are empowered to levy fees, • am ftraid that, technically at all events, Lincoln would have to be re garded as vice-consul at Abadan Reach and hold a letter or nulrot* ity as such. This letter could be issued by the consul at Basra or by the Foreign Office. The former would of course te the normal procedure and we should prefer to adopt it in this case since the letter need not be shewn to the Persian Govemmen' If by chance the latter wished to see the authority under which Lincoln was discharging his new duties, we could always sene nil another letter for the purpose from here.

Sir, -7 Foreign Office, S.W.l. 25th August, 1951. With reference to Foreign Office letter of July 15th j , (K 7949/1628/295) regarding consular services to shipping at Abadan Reach, I am directed by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to explain, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that these duties have hitherto been performed by the staff of the Iraqi port directorate on behalf of His Majesty’s Consul at Basra. The Iraq.! Government, however, recently intimated that they wished their officials to be relieved of the work as soon as possible. Various alternative arrangements were then examined and found impracticable, and the Secretary of State now wishes to reconsider a proposal that the work should be done for the British Consulate at Basra by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah from a floating hulk in Iraqi waters. This suggestion was previously discarded as it seemed probable that it might throw too much work on His Majesty’s Vice- Consul, but no feasible alternative appears to exist and it is now felt that the duties would not be unduly onerous and that the difficulty might be overcome by the grant of a special compensating £250. allowance of two hundred and fifty pounds per annum. 2. His Majesty’s Consul at Basra is now enquiring in a letter, of which a copy is enclosed,whether Mr. Lincoln, His Majesty’s Vice Consul at Mohammerah, would be prepared to assume the duties on these terms and the Secretary of State is calling for the views The Under-Secretary of State,I £250. viev/s of His Majesty 1 s Minister at Tehran. Should no insurmountable difficulty be revealed, it is proposed to inform the Lords Gommissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury that the duties could be undertaken by Mr. Lincoln and to request Their Lordships to sanction the payment to him of an allowance at the rate of two hundred and fifty pounds per annum. I am to enquire whether the Secretary of State for India would be able to concur in this course. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,*4 i*, Doctor lincolu My de«r Linoolw roimuttneraiji I iuiWQ been goliw into tne rafetter of the from Mr. s«loas ooneuiur shipping daties in Ao&amp;dan ^eacu daring i#y leave and I have just learnt that tue Aduilralt^ have valid reasons for not wishing their fuel inspector at Abadan to assume tne additional duties of acting Vice-Consul in respect of Abadan Re&amp;cu. This position urines me oaoit to tne point where X was when I w&amp;a discussing the matter with you during our last ?aeeting. You will remember that (a) you felt rather doubtful about the degree of inconvenience which the wotk, if (o) you were douotfui as to whether tne labour and inconvenience involved would oe adequately remunerated by the proportion of iarte III and IV which under present arrangements are allocated to the Basra ort Directorate official in charge undertaken by you, would involve you in, and of/of taeso duties. 2he Foreign office are no r. r ooneaiting the India office and 'reiirt n and, provided no T insut. ountabie difficulties are revealed from these sources and provided you are willing to undertake the wortf, they h&amp;ve agreed to ask the treasury to sanction the payment to you of a special allowance of two hundred and fifty pounds per annum. Tne alternatively calm and hectic character of the work in Abadan Reach has been taken into account in fixing the remuneration to be sought on your behalf and X feel sure you will not think it ungenerous. If all goes well, I think it should be possible for you to assume the duties towards the end of tne year and I hope soon to hear from you that you will be willing to undertake tne work on these terms. The joo will entail, as we re Used when we were discussing it together, inconvenience at certain moments when a bunch of tankers are in together, but Commander Klbrow told me /■■I me th&amp;t there were always good oalm periods between the rashes when yoar preseace might not be required in vb&amp;d&amp;n Beach for several days at a time* In any c&amp;se I Mve endeavoured to make the duties involved interesting enough from a pecuniary point of view to make you feel that the game was worth the candle.
