We should like to know what advisers you would think it desirable to have in these three states - e.g. financial adviser in Koweit, assistant and possible successor to Belgrave in Bahrein, adviser on Foreign Affairs in Muscat, possible British police officers in Koweit and Bahrein, and any others you would wish to suggest - and also your views on the chances of securing the agreement of the various rulers to such appointments.

Bear Donaldson, ^ Please refer to your letter No. Sxt. aated the 17th August 1946. 4 945/46 2. I had a long talk with Shaikh Saurian on the 2nd September in the course of which I endeavoured to stem a stream of eloquence about Zubarah with suggestions that money should be spent on improving conditions in Manamah and Muharraq* 3. Amongst other things I asked the Shaikh how long he thought Belgrave ought to continue to hold his present office. This produced a paean of praise of both Belgrave and Mrs. Belgrave. The Shaikh referred to the services Belgrave had rendered to his father and himself, talked in glowing terms of his ability efficiency and energy and remarked that he was doing the work of four men. This gave me an opening to suggest that he required an assistant. The suggestion was not favourably received the Shaikh remarking that ne did not consider an assistant was necessary. 4. I have an idea that -^elgrave hopes that his son who is now 16 and has recently entered a college at Beirut will in due course come to Bahrain as his assistant and subsequently succeed him, and that the Shaikh is privy to tnis plan. 5. I propose to press the suggestion that Belgrave should be provided with an assistant either directly or through the Political Agent as opportunity arises. Personally I do not consider the matter one of great urgency, and I think it unlikely that the Shaikh will be shifted from his present attitude until Belgrave shows obvious signs of collapse or until some serious disturbance or breakdown of the administration gives proof of his inability to carry on single-handed. 6. So far as the present administration of the State is concerned, although there is much that could and should be done it is greatly in advance of anything the other Gulf States can show, as the Shaikh remarked in reply to some of my criticisms. 7.

I t fcki A Please refer to paragraph 4 of your personal- —j confidential letter No. Ext. 3606/46 of the 20th June 1946. 2. Belgrave has now been in Bahrain for 20 years and this long time in such a trying climate and constant association with Arabs has undoubtedly affected his mentality and sapped his powers of initiative. In addition he is the possessor of an artistic temperament which rarely goes hand in hand with outstanding administrative ability. 3. He is, I think, popular with the Shaikh and though there is ill-feeling against him amongst certain classes there is no sign of any open agitation. My instinct at present is to make no immediate change. 4. Belgrave will reach the age of 65 in December 1949, and we should do our best to ensure that he goes then if nothing has induced him to retire earlier. Meanwhile the Political Resident and Political Agent must prod him continuall in order to induce him to carry out the reforms and develop ments which Bahrain* s importane as a centre of oil production and air communications has rendered necessary. Before very long we shall have seriously to consider suggesting to the Shaikh the desirability of finding an assistant for him, who if he proved satisfactory would eventually succeed him. 6. The above are my views at present after consulting Galloway who is in general agreement. If after a few months* further stay in Bahrain I find good reason to change them I will inform you accordingly. % 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Weightman. Sd/ W.R. Hay E.P. Donaldson Esquire, C.M.G. The India Office, London.It is now nearly two centuries since tine Islands of Bahrain have become under the kind protection of the Gre£ Britain and we have enjoyed the kind control and organisat ion of all your officials without any exceptions, but an idea was created twenty five years ago that we should have a financial adviser to which we were thankful at the beginn ing and would have remained so had it not been that we were so unlucky to get the wrong type of man to maintain this post. Hereunder we beg to give an outline of our disapproved and most gravely position. Mr. G. Dalrymple Belgrave, the financial Adviser took office in Bahrain in 1921 and he was only to manage and organise the financial side of the country which he did for a certain period as there was a strong Political Agent in the person of Major Daly, so he was watched carefully and put back to the right track from now and then. Since about ten years this gentleman has declared his dictatorship over Bahrain and ignored every one on these Islands including our Shaikhs and most of the Political Agents also unless they are exceptionally outstanding figures. i On the occasion of conducting the agreement between Bahrain Government and American Oil Company, this man took the liberty without consulting either the local authorities nor the public representatives and limited the wages of Bahrain employees in each category no matter what their capability or ability may be they should not exceed that limit. People brought from abroad for the same job receive twice or even more that a Bahraini and both the persons work in the same post and under the same roof. Lately this gentleman to give Bahrain Petroleum Company as much help as he can he stopped Bahrainis from leaving to Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia, ^atar Peninsular etc. where they get much more pay and cancelled all the Pass ports previously issued. This action only to force them to work with this American Company and to show his authority and his unresistible dictatorship. This man has utilised the weakness of our present ruler and had his own way. Below we enumerate the posts at present are occupied by ei ther Brit ish or Indian Officials in Bahrain, but only namely as they cannot do any single thing in their own jobs whatever their experience is. It might not be believed when we state that he even interferes in Doctors directorship of hospitals etc. causing one of the best British Doctors we ever had Dr. Jhons to resign: 1. Finance (his own no doubt) 2. Director of Customs &amp; Port Officer. 3. Education Director. 4. Commandant State Police. 5. State Medical Officer. 6. General Chairman of Municipalities (Moharraq &amp; 7. The Head Judge of the Law Courts. Manamah) 8. The Head Judge of Criminal Courts. 9. State Engineer. 10. Passport Officer. 11. Superintendent Public Works. EDUCATIONISDUCATION. This is no doubt the most i mismanagement does not only affect the presen its mischief to the future generations* 19 rtant subject as its extends This institution was founded in Bahrain 28 years ago and was managed and financed by a group of wealthy mer chants of Bahrain and things were going in the right direction. Hr. Belgrave did not like such an institute quite separated from his own personal influence and immediately took steps dissolving that committee, taking over the funds and started from the beginning. Certainly he ruined the whole system. Had it not been for the kind attention of the Political Agent, the Hon’ble the Political Resident and the British Council in Cairo we would have had no schools by now on the Island s . Mr.J .F.Y»akelin was appointed by tVie British Council as Education Director, Bahrain. This certainly was a nice blow to Mr. Belgrave*s influence. Mr. Wakelin adopted new Education methods on the most modem system and brought Egyptian teachers and conditions improved nicely, but on the long run the Adviser started putting obstacles in Mr. Wakelin f s way, sometimes creating financial excuses, other limiting Mr. V/akelin's lectures and speeches in the schools until he was so annoyed and was compelled to resign. We feel sure that the Political Agent’s files have got a great deal to say on this point. So we lost another most capable man as a victim of Mr. Belgrave* s egoism. We all think that if this man remains in power there will come a day when we will find ourselves going back to the middle ages. tfe perfectly know that the Great Britain is one of the leading if not the leading, nations to encourage education and spread the knowledge amongst every people they came in contact with, but unfortunately, we have been treated by this man otherwise. COURTS. It cannot be imagined that a country existing in the 20th century and has an important worldly situation such as Bahrain has got no Law of its own. It is still difficult to realise that this man took office in 1921 and since became the main source of regulation and never thought of compiling a law to enable the citizen to know the right and avoid the wrong. We admit that we must compile our own laws, but that if we were left free of his misnuling and dictatorship. In the past we use to have one court only and that is 'SHARA' based mainly on the holy “QURAN' which most of the Moslems learn by heart. So the faults are quite obvious and avoidable, but after this man has established several courts appointing himself as the head judge of them all, things became so complicated and vague. Moreover he had appointed as assistants judges some youths of the ruling family, who are not only lacking education and illiterate, but have got not the slightest idea of courts or any amount of life experience and no doubt your honour will be surprised to know that all these hardly can sign their own names correctly. In the hands of these ignorant lots of young shaikhs are the lives, the wealth and the interest of the Bahrain population is lying. Dountless you find several cases of the same nature and same circumstances, but diff erent judgement. This depends mainly how one of the Parties is related, or friend of one of those occupying the Court Chair. Relationship, friendship etc. play the most important part on this stage. No matter how the proofs may be clear and genuine, one must suffer when those elements are against him. We could very easily give several examples on this subject, but not to waste your honour’s time, we will only mention one. Two persons were accused of drinking liquor - which Belgrave made one of the most serious crimes - they were tried,one of them was sentenced six months vigorouswhen children lost their lives as the police carried out a surprise - 3 - the an imprisonment, which is correct in accei*dance prevailing law for this purpose, while‘the other &lt; ne who enjoys the friendship of an autho ri ty ■ an&lt;i- serves in important department, w a s fined Rs.1000/- and. set free. It must be clear that the one got the imprisonment is quite wealthy and runs a well known firm in the country. So it is clear that the country is left without a law so as to enable Mr. Belgrave and his school to satisfy their own feelings when a victim is caught, by varying their law there and then on spot to cover the present demand. P011 Clli COMial^BANT. As a police commandant Mr. Belgrave has a vast field to show his influence and overrule. Amongst the most disgusting orders he had made a s a rule, the searching of every Bahraini’s house at any time a policeman wishes without any warning or searchwarrant. This is only to please the Shaikh Mr. Belgrave pretending to be one of the most careful moslems wanting to eradicate the habit of drinking from Bahrain. It so happened on several occasions^attack on certain houses during late hours at night, hunting for liquors. Because of the kind control of the Political Agent here the foreigners do not suffer from such an attitude. A search warrant must be obtained from the Political Agency before any house can be raided _ and that warrant is not issued, but after careful study of the matter and the importance attached to it. Prom this your honour can imagine our state of affairs and that we are not even left free in our own houses and we have no personal liberty at all. The other appearance of savage ness is the whipping of those who play gambling ’’publicly in the 'Wednesday” bazaar' a sort of punishment used in 'the Middle Ages and still Mr. Belgrave the modem man applies it here in the 20 th century. Certainly* he finds several excuses by throwing such a blame on the Shaikh’s shoulders, but this is not true as the Shaikh does not approve of such a thing and if he does he must be taught better. tfe think that your honour now have a clear picture ot the conditions in Bahrain, so we request the Great Britain to change this man and send to* us a true type of Englishman who has wider knowledge and can handle things in a better manner. \ .Following are our immediate requests without which we cannot be any better*- &lt; 1. Releasing the present adviser and appointing • another one limited to his own sphere. XI 2. Appointing a capable Education Director and setting his hands free to fulfil his own responsibilities• 3. The present State Engineer is the right person required for Bahrain, but should be given fuller authority to handle his own job without inter ference of others. 4. Forming of a Legislative Committee to compile a Law for Bahrain and remain in power to supervise the interior affairs and organisation. 5. Forming of a Labour Committee to safeguard the interests of the labourers on the Islands. We attach help and assistance quite essential for grateful and most ment.

Prom The Hon’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K#C.I#P., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs department, New Delhi. 3i r, \ I liave the honour to refer to Government of India letter No. D.9680-MS/45 dated the 2nd August 1945 regarding the Bahrain State budget 1564. 2. I regret that it has not been found possible to make much progress with the recommendations of the Government of India. In the first place the above mentioned letter was received in my absence and Mr. Belgrave proceeded on leave almost immediately afterwards, and it was not possible to take up the matter with him until my recent visit to Bali rain. There had of course been an abundance of correspondence between myself and the Political Agent, but in the absence of the Financial Adviser to the State it was difficult to come to any tangible conclusions. 3. In the first place I feel that I should comment on the statement in paragraph 4 that Mr. Belgrave ’’had done so much in recent years to put the finances of the State on a sound foot ing”. The fact is that Mr. Belgrave is at present the main obstacle to any administrative improvement in Bahrain. It is not merely the question of the budget, though that could be cri ticised from almost every angle, but the general administration of the State which requires overhauling from top to bottom. During the war this Residency was kqpt so short of officers that it was impossible to attend to matters that were not urgent and until recently the Bahrain State were unable to obtain personnel or plant according to their requirements. Consequently it was impossible either to make plans for the future or to oblige the Adviser to conform to a higher standard of efficiency. I have, in fact, begun to doubt whether it will be possible to make much improvement during Mr. Belgrave’s tenure of this post. 4. As regards the points mentioned in paragraph 6, Mr. Belgrave has not apparently felt able to give effect to the suggestions. I must confess that I myself am doubtful of their value in so small a budget, and they will have the drawback that it would render comparison with past budgets more difficult. Further, it must be remembered that Mr. Belgrave is obliged to submit his budgets to His Highness Shaikh Salman whose grasp of financial matt ers is somewhat limited. In this connection it is relevant to mention that Kis Highness* father was quite unable to comprehend a budget expressed in figures, and it was necessary to redraft them for hinl in the foim of a letter* Finally it appears to me that the proposals in this paragraph depend upon the estimated life of the oil fields. So far as I am aware no accurate estimate is available, and such information as I have gleaned places it between 15 and 50 years. It will be seen, therefore, that the matter is not so simple as it appears. 5. I thought it would be useful to go over the adminis tration of Bahrain with Mr. Belgrave and draw his attention to the defects both in this and in the budget. I did this on my last visit, after carefully studying the ground with the Political Agent and enclose a copy of the note I recorded after these discussions. It will be seen that the whole administrative machinery of the State requires consideration, and in some cases, reconsturction, and that it must be admitted that we have not yet succeeded'in 'maintaining the requirements of the Government of India. I can only say that the matter is being pursued to the best of our ability and amongst many other preoccupations, and that where itis found possible to give effect to the recommendations of the Government of India this will be done. I have the honour to be, Si r, Your most obedient servant, 3d. GEOFFREY PRIOR. * - , Political Resident, Persian Gulf.— iH! MOTE OH DISCUSSIONS v.ITH lim. BELGEaVE aT BAHRAIN ON 16TH MARCH, 1946 vL&gt;' : I began by pointing out that the actuals for 1362, 1363, and 1364 bore little connection with the facts and showed that the. budget was almost worthless as an accurst© guide to the financial r^nts in the State. The surpluses owing to under expenditure and under-estimated revenue were over 7 lakhs in 1362, over 19 lakhs in 1363 and although the actuals of expenditure were not given for 1364 it is clear that there must have been a saving of over 13 lakhs owing to the greatly enhanced revenue received. Mr. Belgrave said that this was due to the excess receipts of custom^ revenue and stated that it was difficult to estimate this accurately in advance. I enquired why he had estimated for a drop in 1364 when it was quite obvious that the war would be going on for some time and that there was little chance of a drop in prices. I could not follow Mr. Belgr&amp;ve's reply to this. - I pointed out that the original plan of saving 14 - 15 lakhs a year was now obsolete as the life of the oilfield was obviously secure for some time to come since the Oil Company were sjpe/nding a great deal of money in installing fresh plant. I added that so far as I was aware, the life of the field was estimated at between, at the minimum, anotner 15 years, and possibly as much as 50 years. Mr. Belgrave did not appear to be aware of this. I drew his attention to the fact that the remark in his report two yesrs a^c that people were dying of starvation in villages read^oddly when one reflected that the State'had at that time over half a million pounds in the bank. Mr. Belgrave said that this was really due to the fact that these people were upset by the change of diet necessitated by the cessation of rice supplies. I drew his attention to the fact that the word he had used was 'starvation'. Mr. Belgrave volunteered the statement that when the capital sunk in food supplies was realised the actual balance of the State would be over a million pounds. I said that this gave point to my view that some capital expenditure in the State was Justified and added that I felt certain he ’would have to face rising opposit ion from the public if nothing was done in the very near future. 2. HBaLTH . I drew Hr. Belgrave’s attention to the remark in his report that the staff had been leaving for India owing to inadequate pay. Mr. Belgrave agreed that the State co&amp;ld well afford to pay c»s good wages as the Government of India, and said that the position was now quite satisfactory as the staff were contented with their present terms. I enquired the State Medical Officer’s financial powers, and Mr. Belgrave siad that he was allowed to spend any amounts in his budget. Hr. Belgrave mentioned that there was a 9-bed hospital for women in Muharraq with a Lady Doctor which was always full, and added that there was men’s out-patient hospital there as well. He agreed that Dr. Snow should be asked for his views as to future medical policy in the State. o • ENGINEERING. I enquired the State Engineer’s financial powers and degree of control over the other engineers and the Oil Gauger. The Adviser said that the State Engineer could spend any sum in his budget, but I was not very clear regarding the degree of his control over the other engineers and the proposed Oil Gauger. Mr. Belgrave seemed to take the view that the Oil Gauger's appointment would be completely separate, but I pointed out that it was essentially an engineering job and that in the past the State had had to use the State Engineer for this duty, and that they would almost certainly have to do so again. I gave it as my view that what the State required was an able and highly qualified engineer who would control all the engineering works in the State as Chief Engineer. I remarked on the difficulty that was always experienced in combining' electrical and mechanical work with building and roads, but said that a. single engineering department was obviously desirable. I was not very clear what the qualifications of the new engineer were but understood Mr. Belgrave to say that his work would be more on the lines of roads and buildings. I drew attention to the fact that he had been engag ed without reference to us, a point which is being dealt with later on in this note. I suggested that some standardisation of theelectrical plant might be possible so that spares would be inter- vchangeable, and Mr. Belgrave described the existing plant and said that the point would be borne in mind in the future. I mentioned that the condition of the roads was disgraceful and that so wealthy a State could and should improve them. Mr. Belgrave agreed with this and siad that he hoped something would now be done. He mention ed that new motor vehicles had been ordered and said that they were awaiting the arrival of the consulting engineers to conclude the ter supply agreement. I drew his attention to the agreement with tncjr supply agents in England, which I observed had been concluded without reference to us, and drew attention to the serious defects in it. 4* EDUCaTICN . I pointed out the advantages of getting a man from the British Council to run education in Bahrain and said I would make a final attempt to get one from them. If this failed then the Bahrain Government would have to make their own arrangements. In any case there was little object in anyone corning out now as the school term had not much longer to run. The disadvantage of a large number of boys being educated in Egypt was discussed and this point is still under consideration. I said that it was essential that the v technical school must be run by B^FCC and urged fcah that an early opportunity be taken to include this obligation in the Concession. Colonel Galloway said that this matter was before the Directors o*f the Company and it was agreed that they should be pressed to under take this function. i y* o. I enquired the financial powers of the Director and. Mr.^Belgrave explained that he was empowered to spend any sums incluci ed in his budget. I enquired whether there was any plan of re organisation of the pier of the possibility of having's, bonded ware house. Ur. Belgrave replied that there was proposal to fill in the , dock between the existing pier and the Kanoo Building but said that the question of having bonded warehouse system was introduces as merchants would then be able to make this a centre for the whole Gulf and have a much wider scope open, to them. Mr. Belgrave inquired whether they would not be wiser to take the money while they could get it. I pointed out that the £&gt;tate did not fequire the money and that the time to prevent Has Tanura developing was now as once trade links were forged they were very persistent. It was agreed that the position would be investigated. I enquired from Mr* Belgrave that progress he was making in codifying the regulations and publishing thereof, a task I suggested should be undertaken 15 years ago when I was Political Agent, Bahrain. He replied that the work was proceeding but that its condusion was _ problematic. He is considering the appointment of shaikh Salman oin Hamad bin Isa to devil for him, a duty which will give him an opportunity to discover how much legal knowledge this young Shaikh has acquired in Palestine. Mr. Belgrave confirmed that there was no compilation of State laws and rules in existence, and that the Sudan Penal Code, though relied on, had not been * formally introduced. Apparently His Highness did not care about having the courts bound by set rules for punishments. The Sudan Civil Code is not apparently in force. 7 - ^ PPiJSff• I began by saying that the police in Bahrain were e costly and inefficient and drew attention to some highly discreditable instances that had occurred recently namely the theft of ammunition , Jidda island where it transpired that nearly half a million rounds had not be properly handed over and were in charge of a Lance- JNaik. ^ Mr. Belgrave could give no adequate explanation of this, or indeed of the. fact that an important prisoner in this case had been allowed tu escape by the police and I stated frankly that I thought trie whole matter was highly discreditable and reflected seriously upon him. 1 enquired the iunctions oi the new British Police officers These are apparently making themselves useful and it is intended that' they should prosecute cases in court in which Europeans and Americans are concerned.

I enquired Mr. heIgrave 1 s plans for the future and understood that he is reviewing tne whole matter of the police force and will let us have his conclu sions shortly. S* FIIIaNC^. I observed that hr. Belgrave was approaching the end of his term in Bahrain, and that it was essential that there should ^ someone who should be fully equipped to take over from him. I enquired whether he did not consider there was a case for reverting tc the old position whereby there were three executive officers in the State and having ^n Assistant Adviser now. hr. Belgrave considered th.-. t there was a good case for such an appointment. I enquired aboui the auditing of the State accounts. This is still conducted by a firm domiciled in Basra -who have enough work &gt;in the Island to keep their personnel here for some five months in the year. They are able to audit accounts in Arabic and Mr. Belgrave expressed himslef tho roughly satisfied with their efforts. I asked Mr. Belgrave to be good enough to arrange for his budgeting in future tc have a closer connection with realities, and understood that he hoped to do this. 9 * Apparently little has been done in the way of town planning beyond a proposal to turn the present import yard into a bazaar when the customs sheds are moved out to the dock that is to oe filled in. I drew attention tc the extremely unsightly and completely unorganised rabbit warren of a bazaar and stated that what was wanted was a definite plan for the centre of the town by which proper roads would be intorduced so that decent shops could be erectec Mr. Belgrave said that the land was in various ownerships but I ieplied that there was no reason why a plan should not be worked out anu the various obstacles overcome. Mr. Belgrave undertook to con sider this. x IivBl^TdY . I said that, to my regret, I had ceen unable uo find any industry that could be effectively encouraged in Bahrain with the possible exception of a briquetting plant which apparently involved difficulties. It appears that the coke has a nign sulphur content which makes it unsuitable for blacksmithing, but if the coke could be briquetted and exported to Persian it would be a very valuable counter in producing supplies in return, so the matter is not simply one for the Gil Company but one in which Bahrain gen erally n«.s a vital stake. The great drawback in locating any industries in Bahrain is tne high cost of labour as compared with xndia, «.nd trie xact that they would not oe sheltered benind a high tariff wall as in Persia. 11. I enquired what progress had been made in agriculture and Mr. Belgr^ve said that it was proposed to engage an Egyptian who was shortly leaving the SaUdi Arabian service. I pointed out the draw- bacus of engaging men in this haphazard way and siad it would be much better lor Mr. Belgrave, if he wanted Egyptian agriculturists, to fly to U.iro and go into the matter there where a much larger selection would be available for him. ^ drew Mr. B^lgrave’s attention to recent instances of the engagement of Eurppean personnel without reference to us and reminded him that he had been warned about this on earlier occasions.

I said that the matter would be taken up with the India Office who would be asked to see ' in future tnat such action was not taken without reference to us and re mnded him again oi the position for his guidance in the fut'ure. 13.

I asked him t© give us ample notice in due course of his intention to retire so that we could take steps to arrange for a successor. 2. I have reason to believe that one of the reasons why Belgrave may be anxious to stay on as long as possible is that he will have very little to live on when he retires. It is true that the Bahrain Government are subscribing to a Provident Fund for him but I do not think that this will bring him in an adequate income especially in these days. It would probably assist him to make up his mind about retiring if we could find some further employment for him. He told me that he had been offered some kind of job at home but that it was not very attractive. I think he would probably prefer employment outside the United Kingdom. E.P. 3. One of the reasons why i have been unwilling to press more strongly for Belgrave*s retirement is that I am not certain whether the Shaikh would readily agree to take another British Adviser in his place. He is more likely to do so if, when the time comes, the Shaikh of Kuwait has accepted one or more British Advisers. Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, LONDON. S.W.l■ F1L CO NFIDENTIAL o. 1672-S His Majesty'^ Commonwe PERL IAN GULF BaHRaIN , the 19th September 1947 INDEX-( State for Copy to the Political Agent, BAHRAIN MLEORAIIDUM Owing to labour from Bahrain being attracted by the higher wage rate prevailing in Saudi Arabia the Bahrain Government some time ago imposed restrictions on the migration elsewhere of Bahraini employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, and of the Bahrain Government and on artizans required for building projects in Bahrain. 2. Recent increases in the wage rate of Arab labour in Saudi Arabia have had an unsettling effect on labour in Bahrain. The local labour of the Bahrain Petroleum Company have threatened to strike and leaflets have been circulated denouncing the Bahrain Government, and in particular the Adviser, Mr. Belgrave, for the keeping down of wages and the orders mentioned in paragraph 1 above, restricting the free and economic movement of labour. 3. The Bahrain,Petroleum Company have met the situation by agreeing to increase the basic wage for Arab labour from Rs.1/12/- to Rs.2/12/- per day. The management is however concerned at the situation and have reported the matter to their New York Office.- 4. The growing projects of the American Arabian Oil Company and of Petroleum^Development (Qatar), Limited, and the construction of the Riadh Railway will greatly increase in the near future the demand for Arab labour on the mainland. The Bahrain Petroleum Company are reported to be prepared to-a pay sufficiently attractive wages to retain their labour voluntarily. In order to prevent more serious labour unrest and dissatisfaction with the administration it will be necessary for the Bahrain Govern ment to adopt a sufficiently attractive standard of wages. I am informed that the Bahrain Government are urgently considering measures. Sd/- a.C. Galloway. Political Resident, Persian Gulf. ATTESTED &gt;/.

Prior’s letter No* 398-3, dated the 5th April 1946 to the Govern ment of India, and enclosure.

Persian Gulf Residency, Bush ire, 5 th April, 19 4 6 . From - The Hon’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.F., Political Resident, Persian Gulf. To - The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, NEW D E L H I. S ir, I have the honour to refer to Government of India letter No. D.9680-ME/45 dated the 2nd August 1945 regard ing the Bahrain State budget 1364. 2. I regret that it has not been found possible to make much progress with the recommendations of the Government of India. In the first place tVie above mentioned letter was received in my absence and Mr. Belgrave proceed ed on leave almost immediately afterwards, and it was not possible to take up the matter with him until my recent visit to Bahrain. There had of course been an abundance of correspondence between myself and the Political Agent, but in the absence of the financial Adviser to the State it was difficult to come to any tangible conclusions. 3. In the first place I feel that I should comment on the statement in paragraph 4 that Mr. Belgrave M had done so mych in recent years to put the finances of the State on a sound footing'. The fact is that Mr. Belgrave is at present the main obstacle to any administrative improvement in Bahrain. It is not merely the question of the budget, though that could be ccriticised from almost every angle, but the general administration of the State which requires overhauling from top to bottom. During the war this Residency was kept so short of officers that it was impossible to attend to matters that were not urgent and until recently the Bahrain State were unable to obtain personnel or plant according to their requirements. Consequently it was impossible either to make plans for the future or to oblige the Adviser to conform to a higher standard of efficiency. I have, in fact, begun to doubt whether it will be possible to make much improvement during Mr. Belgrave’s tenure of this post. 4. As regards the points mentioned in paragraph 6, Mr. Belgrave has not apparently felt able to give effect to the suggestions. I must confess that I myself am doubtful of their value in so small a budget, and they will have the drawback that it would render comparison with past budgets more difficult. Further, it must be remembered that Mr. Belgrave is obliged to submit his budgets to His Highness Shaikh Salman whose grasp of financial matters is somewhat limited. In this connection it is relevant to / mention...i mention that His Hi^iness* father was quite unable ^ comprehend a budget expressed in figures, and it was necessary to redraft them for him in the form of a letter. Finally it appears to me that the proposals in this paragraph d epend upon the estimated life of the oil fields. So far as I am aware no accurate estimate is available, and such information as I have gleaned places it between 15 and 50 years. It will be seen, therefore, that the matter is not so simple as it appears. 5. I thought it would be useful to go over the administration of Bahrain with Mr. Belgrave and draw his attention to the defects both in this and in the budget. I did this on my last visit, after carefully studying the ground with the Political Agent, and enclose a copy of the note I recorded after these discussions. It will be seen that the whole administrative machinery of the State requires consideration, and in some cases, recon struction, and that it must be admitted that we have not yet succeeded in maintaining the requirements of the Government of India. I can only say that the matter is being pursued to the best of our ability, and amongst many other preoccupations, and that where it is found possible to give effect to the recommendations of the Government of India this will be done. I have the honour to be, S ir, ^ Your most obedient servant, Sd. GEOFFREY PRIOR. Political Resident, Persian Gulf. RHL.KOTE ON DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. BELGRA at Bahrain on igth march 19 46. I began by pointing out that the actuals for 1362, 1363 and 1364 bore little connection with the facts and showed that the budget was almost worthless as an accurate guide to the financial events in the State. The surpluses owing to under eapenditure and under-estimated revenue were over 7 lakhs in 1362, over 19 lakhs in 1363 and although the actuals of expenditure were not given for 1364 it is clear that there must have been a saving of over 13 lakhs owing to the greatly enhanced revenue received. Mr. Belgrave said that this was due to the excess receipts of customs revenue and stated that it was difficult to estimate this accurately in advance. I inquired why he had estimated for a drop in 1364 when it was quite obvious that the war would be going on for some time and that there was little chance of a drop in prices. I could not follow ' Mr. Belgrave # s reply to this. I pointed out that the original plan of saving 14 - 15 lakhs a year was now obsolete as the life of the oilfield was obviously secure for some time to come since the Oil Company were spending a great deal of money in installing fresh plant. I added that so far as I was aware, the life of the field was estimated at between, at the minimum, another 15 years, and possibly as much as 50 years. Mr. Belgrave did not appear to be aware of this. I drew his attention to the fact that the remark in his report two years ago that people were dying of starvation in villages read oddly when one reflected that the State had at that time over half a million pounds in the bank. Mr. Belgrave said that this was really due to the fact that these people were upset by the tfiange of diet necessitated by the cessation of rice supplies. I drew his attention to the fact that the word he had used was ’’starvation” . Mr. Belgrave volunteered the statement that when the capital sunk in food supplies was realised the actual balance of the State would be over a million pounds. I said that this gave point to my view that some capital expenditure in the State was justified and added that I felt certain he would have to face rising opposition from the public if nothing was done in the very near future. 2. HEALTH . I drew Mr. Belgrave’s attention to the remark in his report that the staff had been leaving for India owing to inadequate pay. Mr. Belgrave agreed that the State could well afford to pay as good wages as the Government of India* and said that the position was now quite satis factory as the staff were contented with their present terms. I inquired the State Medical Officer’s financial powers, and Mr. Belgrave said that he was allowed to spend any amounts in his budget. Mr. Belgrave mentioned that there was a 9-bed hospital for women in Muharraq with a lady Doctor which was always full, and added that there was a men’s out-patient hospital there as well. He agreed that Dr. Snow should be asked for his views as to future medical policy in the State. 3. ENGINEERING . I inquired the State Engineer’s financial powers and degree of control over the other engineers and the / Oil.. .Oil Gauger. The Adviser said that the 3pja^ Engineer could spend any sum in his budget, but I jw as n ot very clear regarding, the degree of his control over ^he other engineers and the proposed Oil Gauger. Mr. Belgrave seemed to take the view that the Oil Gauger’s appointment would be completely separate, but I pointed out that it was essentially an engineering job and that in the past the State had had to use the State Engineer for this duty, and that they would almost certainly have to do so again. I gave it as my view that what the State required was an able and highly qualified engineer who would control all the engineering works in the State as Chief Engineer. I remarked on the difficulty that was always experienced in combining electrical and mechanical work with building and/roads, but said that a single engineering department was obviously desirable. I was not very clear what the qualifications of the new engineer were but understood Mr. Belgrave to say that his work would be more on the lines of roads and buildings. I drew attention to the fact that he had been engaged without reference to us, a point which is being dealt with iater on in this note. I suggested that some standardisation of the electrical plant might be possible so that spares would be inter changeable, and Mr. Belgrave described the existing plant and said that the point would be borne in mind in the future. I mentioxned that the condition of the roads was disgraceful and that so wealthy a State could and should improve then. Mr. Belgrave agreed with this and Said that he hoped something would now be done. He men tioned that new motor vehciles had been ordered and said that they were awaiting the arrival of the consulting engineers to conclude the water supply agreement. I drew his attention to the agreement with their supply agents in England, which I observed had been concluded without reference to us, and drew attention to the serious defects in it. 4. EDUCATION. I pointed out the advantages of getting a man from the British Council to run education in Bahrain and said I would make a final attempt to get one from them. If this failed then the Bahrain Government would have to make their own arrangements. In any case there was little object in anyone coming out now as the school term had not much longer to run. The disadvantage of a large number of boys being e ducated in Egypt was discussed and this point is still under ^ consideration. I said'that it was essential that the technical school must be run by BAPCO and urged that an early opportunity be taken to include this obligation in the Concession. Colonel Galloway said that this matter was before the Directors of the Company and it was agreed that they should be pressed to undertake this function. 5. CUSTOMS. I'inquired the financial powers of the Director and Mr. Belgrave explained that he was empowered to spend any suma included in his budget. I inquired whether there was any plan of reorganisation of the pier or the possibility of having a bonded warehouse. Mr. Belgrave replied that there was a proposal to fill in thd dock between the existing pier and the Kanoo Building but said that the question of having bonded warehouse had not been considered. I drew attention to the fact that Has Tanura was now being put on the slow mail run and said that I feared this would divert a good deal of trade from Bahrain which could probably be retained if a bonded warehouse system was introduced as merchants would then be able to / make.. ..- 3 - a much vW ether th&lt; ider make this a centre for the whole Gulf and scope open to them. Mr. Belgrave inquire would not be wiser to take the money while it. I pointed out that the State did not require the money and that the time to prevent Ras Tanura developing was now as once trade links were forged they were very persistent. It was agreed that the position would be investigated. 6 • judici al. I inquired from Mr. Belgrave what progress he was making in codifying the regulations and publishing thereof, a task I suggested should be undertaken 15 years ago when I wag Political Agent, Bahrain. He replied that the work was proceeding but that its conclusion was problem atic. He is considering the appointment of Shaikh Salman bin Hamad bin Isa to devil for him, a duty which will give him an opportunity to discover how much legal knowledge this young Shaikh has acquired in Palestine. Mr. Belgrave confirmed that there was no compilation of State laws and rules in existence, and that the Sudan Penal Code, though relied on, had not been formally introduced. Apparently His Highness did not care about having the courts bound by set rules for punishments. The Sudan Civil Code is not apparently in force. 7. POUCE. I began by saying that the police in Bahrain were costly and inefficient and drew attention to some highly (discreditable instances that had occurred recently namely the theft of ammunition from Jidda Island where it transpired that nearly half a million rounds had not been properly handed over and were in charge of a Lance-Ha ik. Mr. Belgrave could give no adequate explanation of this, or indeed of the fact that an important prisoner in this case had been allowed to escape by the police and I stated frankly that I thought the whole matter was highly discreditable and reflected seriously upon him. I inquired the functions of the new British Police officers. These are apparently making themselves useful and it is intended that they should prosecute cases in court in which Europeans and Americans are concerned. They are mounted on motor bicycles. Mr. Belgrave said that they were popular with His Highness, which is very fortunate. I inquired the suitability of having an Iraqi officer in the Police and Mr. Belgrave replied that he was an excellent man and most useful. I expressed surprise that in 15 years it had not been found possible to train up a team of highly reliable local men. I inquired Mr. Belgrave’s plans for the future and under stood that he is reviewing the whole matter of the police force and will let us have his conclusions shortly. S. finance . I observed that Mr. Belgrave was approaching the end of his term in Bahrain, and that it was essential that there should, be someone who should be fully equipped to take over from him. I inquired whether he did not consider there was a case for reverting to the old position whereby there were three executive officers in the State and having an Assistant Adviser now. Mr. Belgrave con sidered that there was a good case for such an appointment. I inquired about the auditing of the State accounts. This is still conducted by a firm domiciled in Basra who have enough work in the Island to keep their personnel here for some five months in the year. They are able to i / audit./ - 4 - audit accounts in Arabic and Mr. Belgrave ex pressed hims thoroughly satisfied with their efforts. _ Belgrave to be good enough to arrange for his budgeting in future to have a closer connection with realities, and understood that he hoped to do this. 9. TOWK PLANNING . Apparently little has been done in the way of town planning beyond a proposal to turn the present import yard into a bazaar when the customs sheds are moved out to the dock that is to be filled in. I drew attention to the extremely unsightly and completely unorganised raboit warren of a bazaar and stated that what was wanted was a definite plan for the centre of the town by which proper roads would be introduced so that decent snops could be erected. Mr. Belgrave said that the land was in various ownerships but I replied that there was no reason wby a plan should not be worked out and the various obstacles overcome. Mr. Belgrave undertook to consider this. V 10. hh GOU IUGhMA T O P INDUSTRY . I said that, to my regret, I had been unaole to find any industry that could be effectively encouraged in Bahrain with the possible exception of a briquetting plant which apparently involved difficulties. It appears that the coke has a high sulphur content which makes it unsuitable for blackmsithing, but if the coke could be briquetted and exported to Persia it would be a very valuable counter in producing supplies in return, so the matter is not simply one for the Oil Company but one in which Bahrain generally has a vital stake. The great drawback in locating any industries in Bahrain is the high cost of labour as compared with India, and the fact that they would not be sheltered behind a high tariff wall as in Persia. 11. I inquired what progress had been made in agri culture and Mr. Belgrave said that it was proposed to engage an Egyptian who was shortly leaving the Saudi Arabian service. I pointed out tbe drawbacks of engaging men in this haphazard way and said it would be much better for Mr. Belgrave, if he wanted Egyptian agriculturists, to fly to Cairo and go into the matter there where a much larger selection would be available for him. 12. I drew Mr. Belgrave # s attention to recent instances of the engagement of European personnel without reference to us and reminded him that he had been ’warned about this case had been imagined that matter would be asked to see on earlier occasions. He replied that the discussed with the India Office and that he this had been sufficient. I said that the taken up with the India Office who would be in future that such action was not taken without reference to us and remin/ded him again of the position for his guidance in the future. 13. I inquired whether the swing bridge had paid for its cost or not. Mr. Belgrave replied that it had not yet paid for its initial cost but that this position would shortly be reached. The intention then was to make the bridge free of all tolls, which I said I was glad to hear. Sd. GEOFFREY PRIOR. 25th March 1946. RHL.£ CONFIDSN CIAL . D.O. No.C/395. POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. 14th August, L947. Dear Colonel Galloway, Will you please refer to your roamorandum No. 1413-3, dated the 30th July, 1347, regarding petition dated 21st July, 1947, from ’‘Bahrain island Population , ‘ to the Minister of Colonies, London. 2. I am afraid I have not been able to discover who are the authors of this petition, but my comments on it are as follows:- (a) General Administration. There is no doubt that Belgrave has over- cencralised control of the 3^ate administra tion in his own hands, and abstains as far as possible from delegating any responsibility for decisions, financial or otherwise, to the various heads of departments. (b) education . . Belgrave has done little to influence His Highness to agree to the appointment of a new British Director of Education, vide pelly’s demi-official letter No.c/754, dated the 29th of June, 1947, to you, and demi-official letter No.C/453, dated the 10th April, 1947, to Peutigrew. (c) Administration of justice . The codification of the Bahrain State Laws remains uncompleted. (In this connection please see paragraph 6 of Sir Geoffrey prior’s ’’Note on Discussions with Mr. Belgrave” dated the 13th March, 1946). My own experience of the judicial worA of the members of the Ruling Family is con fined to that of Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad, in the Junior Joint Court. His services tnere are adequate, perhaps because he rarely expresses an original opinion. (d) police . It was in 1932 that Belgrave first assumed, /in addition. The Hon’ble Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, C.I.3•, O.3.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN .In addition to his own duties, those of the Commandant of police on the retire ment of Captain Parke who had until.then been Assistant Adviser and police Officer. The separate post of police Commandant was then H temporarily' 1 retrenched on the grounds of financial stringency. It has since become merged with that of the Adviser, although even in the very beginning, in a D/0. C.35, dated the 11th January, 1333, to Colonel Loch dealing with this question, Belgrave admitted that he could not really afford the necessary time for the work which he had to do in connection with the police in addition to his own ordinary duties, in spite of this, however, Belgrave has clung tightly to the position of Commandant of Police from then until now, and has resisted any suggestion that he should relinquish it. There is no doubt, however, that the Bahrain Police Force has long needed a regular Police Officer to command the State Police, and it seems to me that at the present time when many experienced officers of the Indian police are leaving India it should be possible to recruit a suitable man for the x post. The Police Force as it stands is, with the exception of the British Section, InSfficTent nehd corrupt, and lacks an^ proper system of organisation and training. (e) I do not favour the appointment of either Legislative or Labour Committees in Bahrain, at the present time. Yours sincerely, 3d./- H.D.H. RANGEWith the Compliments of the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State Colonial Office, downing Street, S.W.l.As the address of the Minister we beg to address this to you MANY THANNS. concerned is unknown to us for ownvv’ard transmission please.Bahrain 21st July, 1947 S/S The Minister of Colonies, ! * ^ f ^ 1^7 United Kingdom, London. I Your Excellency, We the Bahrain population have the honour to put the following petition to your honour requesting you to be kind enough to study it carefully and give it the necessary attention. It is now nearly two centuries since the Islands of Bahrain have become under the kind protection of the Great Britain and we have enjoyed the kind control and organisation of all your officials without any exceptions, but an idea was created twenty five years ago that we should have a financial adviser to which we were thankful at the begining and would have remained so had it not been that we were so unluaky to get the wrong type of man to maintain this post. Hereunder we beg to give an outline of our disapproved and most gravely position. Mr.C.Dairymple Belgrave, the financilar Adviser took office in Bahrain in 1921 and he was only to manage and organise the financial side of the country which he did for a certain period as there was a strong Political Agent in the person og Major Daily, so he was watched carefully and put back to the right track from now and then. Since about ten years this gentleman has declared his dectatorship over Bahrain and ignoredd every one on these Islands including our Shaikhs and most of the Political Agents also unless they are exceptionally outstanding figures. On the occasion of conducting the agreement between Bahrain Government and American Oil Company, this man took the liberty without consulting either the local authorities nor the public representatives and limited the wages of Bahrain employees in each categary no matter what their capability oi&gt; ability may be they should not exceed that limit. People brought from abroad for the same job receive twice or even more that a Bahraini and bothe^ persons work in the same post and under the same roof. Lately this geiitleman to give Bahrain Petroleum Company as much help as he can he stopped Bahrainis from leaving to Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar Peninsular etc. where they get much more pay and canc elled all the Passports previously Issued. This action only to fore them to work with this American Company and to show his authority and his unresistible dectatorship. This man has utilised the weakness of our present ruler and had his own way. Below we enumerate the the posts at present are occupied by either British or Indan Officials in Bahrain but only namely as they cannot do any single thing in their own jobs whatever their experience is. It might not be believed when we state that he even interferes in Doctors directorship of hospitals etc. causing one of the best British Doctors we ever had Dr.Jhons to resign^: 1. 2 . 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8 . 9. 10 . 11 . Finance (his own no doubt) Director of Customs &amp; Port Officer. Education Director. Commandant State Police. State Medical Officer.

(Moharraq &amp; Manamah)PAGE No.2 EDUCATION. This is no doubt the most important subject as it5misman agement does not only effect the present, but extends it mischief .to the future generations. This institution was founded in Bahrain 28 years ago and was managed and financed by a group of wealthy merchants of Bahrain and things were going in the right direction. Mr.Belgrave did not like such an institute quite separated from his own personal influence and immediately took steps dissolving that committee, taking over the funds and started from the begining. Certainly he ruined the whole system. Had it not been for the kind attention of the Political Agent,the Honble. Political Residant and the Brirtish Council in Cairo we would had no schools by now on the Islands. Mr.J.F.Wakelin was appointed by the British Council as Education Director, Bahrain. This certainly was a nice blow to Mr. Belgrave^ influence. Mr.Wakelin adopted new Education methods on the most modern system and brought Egyptian teachers and conditions improved nicely, but on the long run the Adviser started putting obs- ticles in Mr.Wakelin 1 s way, sometimes creating financial excuses, other limiting Mr.Wakelin 1 s luctures and speaches in the schools until he was so annoyed and was compelled to resign. We feel sure that the Political Agent's files have got a great deal to say on this point. So we lost another most capable man as a victim of Mr.Belgrave*s egoism. We all think that if this man remains in power there will come a day when we will find ourselves going back to the middle ages. We perfectly know that the Great Britain is one of the leading, if not the leading, nations to encourage education and spread the knowledge amongst every people they came in contact with, but unfortunatley, we have been treated by this man otherwise. COURTS. It cannot be imagined that a country existing in the 2oth century and has an important wordly situation such as Bahrain has got no Law of its own. It is still difficult to realise that this man took office in 1921 and since became the main source of regulation and never thought of compiling a law to enable the citizen to know the right and avoid the wrong. We admit that we must compile our own laws, but that if we were left free of his misruling and decta- torship. In the past we use to have one court only and that is u SHARA' based mainly on the holy ’’QURAN” which most of the Moslems learn by heart. So the faults are quite obvious and avoidable, but after this man has established several courts appointing himself as the head judge of them all, things became so complicated and vague. Moreover he had appointed as assistants judges some youths of the ruling family, who are not only lacking education and illitrated, but have got not the slightest idea of courts or any amount of life experience and no doubt your honour will be surprised to know that all these hardly can sign their own names correctly. In the hands of these ignorant lots of young shaikhs are the lives, the wealth and the interest of the Bahrain population is lying. Doubtless you find several cases of the same nature and same circumstances, but diff erent judgement. This dependss mainly how one of the parties is related, or friend of one of those occupying the Court Chair. Relationship, friendship etc. play the most important part on this stage. No matter how the proofs may be clear and genuine, one must suffer when those elements are against him. We could very easily give several examples on this subject, but not to waste your honour's time, we will only mention one. Two persons were accused of drinking liquor,-which Belgrave made one of the most serious crimes- they were tried, one of thek,was sentenced six months vigorous imprisonment, which is correct in accordance with the prevailing law found for this purp ose, while the other one who enjoys the friendship of an authority and serves in an important department, was fined Rs.1000/- and set free. It must be clear that the one got the imprisonment is quite wealthy and runs a well known firm in the country. So it is clear that tne country is left witout a law so as to enable Mr.BelgravePAGE NO. 3 3 and his school to satisfy their own feelings when a victim is caught, by varying their law there and then on spot to cover the present demand. POLICE COMMANDANT. . As .a police commandant Mr.Belgrave has a vast field to show his influence and overrule. Among the most disgusting orders he had made as a rule, the searching of every Bahraini’s house at any time a policeman wishes without any warning or search warrant. This is only to please the Shaikh Mr.Belegrave pretending to be one of the most careful moslems wanting to erradicate the habit of drinking from Bahrain. It so happened on several occasions when children lost their lives as the police carried out a surprise attack on certain houses during late hours at night, hunting for liquors. Because of the kind control of the Political Agent here the foreigners do not suffer from such an attitude. A search warrant must be obtained from the Political Agency before any house can be raided and that warrant is not issued, but after careful study of the matter and the importance attached to it. Prom this your honour can imagine our state of affairs and that we are not even left free in our own houses and we have no personal liberty at all. The other appearance of savageness Is the whipping of those who play gambling publicly in the “Wednesday' bazaar” a sort of punishment used in the Middle Ages and still Mr.Belgrave the modern man applies It here in the 20th century. Certainly he finds several excuses by throwing such a blame on the Shaikh* shoulders, but this is not time as the Shaikh does not approve of such a thing and if he does he must be taught better. We think that your hnour now have a clear picture of the conditions in Bahrain, so we request the Great Britain to change this man and send to us a true type of Englishman who has wider knowledge and can handle things in a better manner. Following are our immediate requests without which we cannot be any better;- l 1. Releasing the present adviser and appointing another one limited to his own sphere. 2. Appointing a capable Education Director and setting his hands free to fulfil his own responsibilities. 3. The Present State Engineer is the right person required for Bahrain, but should be given fuller authority to handle his own job without interfere nce of others. 4. Forming of a Legislative Committee to compile a a Law for Bahrain and remain in power to super vise the interior affairs and organisation. 5. Forming of a labour Committee to safeguard the interests of the labourers on the Islands. We attach the greatest of hope on your hnour’s help and assistance over these points as all of these are quite essen tial for Bahrain at present and we will be very grateful and most thankful to you and to the British Government. Certainly removing of this man will smooth things nicely as Bahrain had sufferred quite long enough during his office. We have the hnour to be sir, Your most obedient servants.

As you are aware Byard was for some three years Officer Commanding the Muscat Levy until about last September when the Sultan, unwisely in my opinion, dispensed with his services. I know Ryard personally, he is an excellent officer, did well in Muscat, and will, I am sure, do equally well in Bahrain, both in the directionof looking after the Police and any other duties allotted to him. Belgrave is communicating direct with Byard on the subj ect of terms etc., and unless our advice is specially called for by either the Bahrain Goveriment or Byard, I do not think we need inter vene further. * I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and Weightman.

They aeemed to thin* that auca an officer would be more under tneir c onto A. than one actually in Government service. They also laid atreas on the fact that the officer chosen should Know Arabic. Then the Ghaikh called on me today, with members of his family, I touched on the subject, and said that natur ally if they did not want Mir. Jenner I had no intention of preaging the point. They confirmed that this wa$ so, though they aeemed to appreciate my attitude, and there the matter rests. This is a pity as what the Bahrain Police need is a Police Officer for a few years in order to train them in police work. */e have therefore to look round far anotner officer. In this connection as you jcuow (see correspondence ending with my letter No. 167- 3 of 10th March) tne Sultan of Muscat has some idea of dispensing witn the services of ^aptain Byard* the Officer Commanding of the Muscat Infantry, and having instead a /azir (a British Officer) to look after his foreign affairs and assist him generally in the administ ration of his State. My own opinion is that Captain T3yard is quite capable of performing those duties, but if the lultan thinks otherwise he of course will have to go. In this case Captain Byard would, I think, do well for the post of Officer Commanding Bahrain Police (though doubtless not so well as Mr. Jenner who is a trained police officer), and ex officio Assistant to Mr. Belgrave. Captain Byard's contract with the Multan of Muscat expires in October next, r have already given my opinion of Captain Byard *9 capabil ities and will not repeat it.4 As yoa are aware when I see the -Sultan in London I propose approaching him on the question of Captain lyard. Should the Sultan confirm his decision to dispense with Captain Byard’a services we can approach the Bahrain Government with the suggestion that they should employ him. 3d.

I am not quite sure whether this solution would really be satisfactory to Mr. Belgrave. I gathered in conversation with him that he enjoys looking after the police force, and regards it as a very pleasant change from his office duties. On the other hand, I do not think we can intervene again at this stage, and it is no doubt the case that, if a reliable and experienced officer can be obtained from the Indian Police, he will be able to take a good deal off Mr. Belgrave’s shoulders in judicial as well as in purely police administration. Indeed, he might quite well be the sort of person who could act for Mr. Belgrave when he is away. ? put by and await any developments. If we see Colonel Loch this summer we might be able to find out from him whether the arrangement is likely to be satisfactay. It is possible also that I may see Mrs. Belgrave, who is, I think, going to be home this summer.NDEXEH f By Air Hail, f D.O. Bo.F.582-11/36. ^ . r Foreign and Political Department. ;jb r ' Be* Delhi.

On a recent visit to Bahrain a suitabie;,opportunity of taking up the matter with the Shaikh occurred as he him self had written to the Political Agent, suggesting the appointment of an Assistant for Belgrave. As a preliminary step, with Loch and Belgrave, I went into the latter’s work and found that his time was taken up with an immense amount of detail. This detail was mainly under two heads: the State’s accounts, and the Shaikh’s private accounts and general business connected with the Shaikh’s private property. A third direction in which Belgrave had to spend his time to some extent was to supervise buildings. 3. Whatever else the Assistant could, or could not, do it is obvious that he would not be of much use in dealing with the above details, and it would of course take time to procure a suitable individual to fill the post. I therefore made the suggestions to the Shaikh which are contained in Loch’s letter No.c/496-4/3 dated the 23rd November 1936 to the Shaikh, copy of which I enclose. These suggestions Belgrave heartily welcomed. When the subordin ates mentioned in Loch’s letter are appointed much petty work will be taken off Belgrave’s shoulders, and he will have / Mo J* Claus on Esquire, The India Office, London. regd. pol. 12 JAN 1937 IN Da OrFiQE.Mb -2- l.. • «».,&lt;* /%-. 4 ^ t S ” * have far more time for his important duties in connection with the supervision of the State, and in other directions.

'^u^' hm o. 1 ble Lieut.Gel*l.v. -.i £ ewle* # ®C) a WALTON.a / rs The question of an Assistant for Mr. Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrein Government, was discussed with Colonel Powle during his deputation at the India Office. It was pointed out that the original proposal had been made from the Hesideney and approved in 1934 and that the only reason why an Assistant was not appointed was that the man in view turned out at the last moment not to he available* Colonel Powle exjilained that he had changed his view since then and that he was now inclined not to favour the proposal on the ground that there was no immediate danger, in his opinion, of a breakdown of the administrative machine and that it was better for the Bahreinis to learn to help themselves and not to be depending on a large European staff* Colonel Fowl© was informed that the Indie Office and the Government o r India were impressed by the arguments in support of the proposal, e*g* the great expansion of work resulting from oil development, the air route, the transfer of the Naval Base, etc,, the probability that the expansion would continue, the risk of a bi^eakdown in Mr* Belgrave’s he?ilth, and the desirability of providing for continuity of administration during his absences on leave* It was suggested to Colonel Fowle that the proposal for an Assistant^ to Mr. Belgrave need not in any way run counter to the principle, wh ch we recognise to be sound in itself, of the Bahreinis running their own affairs, and the appointment of an Assistant might be linked with special instructions to Mr. Belgrave that he and his Assistant should devote part of their attention end time to training up t e Bahreinis, particularly the members of the Buling Family, to undertake administrative duties. It seemed clear that at the present tine they v/ere not in fact competent to do so* The/The Government of Indie in March 1936 informed the Resident that they left the quest on of ©n Assistant to hit discretion. The Government of India have, however# reverted to the subject since (see attached extract of a letter from them). Colonel Fowle said that he would 1&gt;ok into the matter again on his return to the Gulf and would discuss it with Colonel Loch and Mr. Belgrave. It was agreed that the India Office would await the report from Colonel Fowle# which might be expected quite shortly, before considering the matter further.Extract from letter from the Government of India, Foreign end Political Department, dated the 27th August, 1936. provided always that the Shaikh^ attitude is favourable, we cannot help feeling that the very great increase in the importance of Bahrain, coupled with the extension of administrative activities which must inevitably follow the expansion of the oil industry, the arrival of the Navy and the impending transfer of the Residency, indicates that Fowle’sview is too conservative. ' e do not wish to risk a break down in Belgrave’s health and suggest that opportunity should be taken during Fowle's visit to England to press on him the arguments which suggest that he should review his opinion* We have no particular officer in view, but the post would be suitable for a junior officer o-p the Political Department on deputation who might shew a predilection for Arabs and Arabia*Llt~+ ~L /^» A ‘ It Jo 4* 2^ We have taken the opportunity, as requested in Menon’s letter of 27 August, to try to persuade Fowle to revise his opinion on the question of an Assistant for Belgrave. I agree that the case for this is a very strong one. I see that Fowle himself agreed to the proposal in 1934 and an appointment would have actually been made if Luard had been available. But Fowle subsequently changed his opinion on the grounds of the principle that Bahrein should so far as possible be administered by Bahreinis. We feel that this is a good principle but that it can only be applied gradually. Meanwhile, the accumulation of work falling on Belgrave (the Court, the Police, the extra work resulting from the increased importance of Bahrein in respect of oil, air, the Naval base, etc.) and the prospect of the work continuing to expand fully justify the appointment of a European Assistant; it would be a calamity if Belgrave’s health broke down from overwork. In deference to Fowle’s point of view, I suggested to him that he might see his way to recommending an appointment on the understanding that the Adviser and his Assistant would devote part of their attention to the question of training up Bahreinis for/for administrative jobs. He seemed to think this' was a good idea, and said that he would look into the question again with Loch and Belgrave on his return to the Gulf. I hope the result will be that he will waive his objections.a i P -Z_ 6,4 t ^ / 3C , Mr. Walton . A precis of the correspondence about an Assistant for Mr. Belgrave is attached. The position appears from f*f4i M LfxU it to be that in 1934 the Resident, political Agent, Government of India, India Office, and the sheikh were all agreed as to the desirability of the post and the terms to be attached to it. It was only by an accident that an Assistant was not then appointed. Since then the only new factor in the situation is that Mr. Belgrave^ terms have apparently been slightly improved; on the other hand the financial position of Bahrein has become sgeoe^ingly prosperous and the State can easily afford an Assistant. All the arguments in favour of the appointment of an Assistant remain and are indeed increased (the B.P.C.Refinery, the establishment of the Naval Base, and the activities of P.C.L. are new factors increasing the Adviser * s work). The main argument on which Colonel Fowle insists is that tha Bahreinis should administer for themselves. This seems to be covered by Colonel Loch»s 18th July 1934, especially paragraphs 2 and 6\ v« / In his letter of 18th July 1934 (P.Z.5533/34) Colonel Loch, when Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, recommended to the Government of India the appointment of an Assistant to Mr. Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrein Government. He explained that owing to the development of Bahrein in the last decade from complete obscurity and almost Bedouin rule to a State administered on modern lines the Adviser had more work than one man could do. Endeavours had been made to delegate work to members of the Ruling Family but owing to lack of aducation there was no one who could undertake such duties as complicated work connected e.g. with oil and air developments. Further, the British Commandant of Police had been dispensed with, as an economy, and his duties taken on by Mr. Belgrave. Mr. Belgrave was gravely overworked and leave had become essential to his health. Temporary arrangements had been made for carrying on in his absence but these were not ideal. What was wanted was an Assistant not only to relieve the Adviser but also to provide continuity in his absence (which must necessarily, in that climate, be reasonably frequent). Colonel Loch emphasised that this proposal did not in any way signify a desire to ’westernize* Bahrein. On the contrary the ’Al Khalifah family were being made to function as far as possible as a kind of Executive Council. The possibility of getting an Arab Assistant had been considered but there was no suitable local man. Colonel Loch added that he understood the Sheikh considered the appointment necessary, and Colonel Fowle A agreed, provided the matter was submitted to the Government of India before the Sheikh was consulted. in/In a letter of the same date to Mr. Metcalfe, Colonel Loch said a man called Luard, at the time employed by the A.P.O.C.* was a suitable candidate for the post* In their telegram of 1st August 1934 (P.Z.5533/34) the Gov ernment of India approved the proposal generally as an experimental measure for one year provided the Sheikh was agreeable. In a letter to Mr. laithwaite dated September 6th 1934 (P.Z.5856/34) Colonel Loch forwarded a draft Contract for Mr. Luard,saying that the sheikh had approved of the terms and of Mr. Luard»s appointment, and that Colonel Fowle had suggested approaching the A.P.O.C. through the India Office. The A.P.O.C. were approached in a letter from this Office dated 24th September 1934 (P.Z.5856/34) but replied (P.Z.6043/34) that they did not find themselves able in existing circumstances to release Mr. Luard from his engagement to them. It was accordingly deemed impossible to aarry matters further. On March 3rd, 1935, Colonel Loch wrote to Colonel Fowle (P.Z.2721/35) confirming the conclusions reached in a conversation between them regarding proposals Mr.Belgrave had made for a revision of his terms of service. Oib of these conclusions was 'that if the pay of the appointment of Adviser were to be raised, it would be inadvisable to create a post of Assistant to the Adviser and that, as Mr. Luard is not available, the proposal should be dropped and an attempt be made to place responsibilities for some of the work now done by the Adviser on to others and to add to his higher clerical staff* 1 . Colonel Fowle forwarded the proposals in regard to Mr. Belgrave^s terms of service to the Government of India who agreed (P.Z.3673/35) in their letter/3 letter of 8th May that the proposals should be put to the Sheikh. in a telegram of 28th May 1935 (P.Z.4189/35) they added that they were considering the question of an Assistant in connection with the Baharinah question, and that the agreement to Mr. Belgrave’s increased remuneration 'need not be read as definitely excluding consideration of proposal for Assistant'. Meanwhile on March 18th 1935 (P.Z.4177/35) Colonel powle had submitted a despatch on the subject of the grievances of the Baharinah in Bahrein, particularly in respect of the law courts. In this connection he mentioned that in order to minimise these grievances the Sheikh had for some time made Mr. Belgrave sit on the bench in the Joint Court. This Colonel Powle regarded as undesirable (apart from the extra work thrown on Mr. Belgrave) since 'it is not our business in Bahrein to administer justice for the Bahrein Government b\t to induce and teach the latter to administer justice themselves, and it is a reflection on the judicial system of that Government that justice can only be ensured by the placing of a foreigner on the bench'. In their reply of the 6th November 1935 (P.Z.8485/35) the Government of India (after consultation witn the Secretary of State) said they were reluctant to concur in the suggestion that the presence of a European State Official on the Bahrein Court should be dispensed with, since 'the Ruling family still have much to learn in the matter of judicial probity'. 'They admit that the addition of this duty to the multifarious duties of the Advister must result in overwork for Mr.Belgrave, but they would suggest that the solution lies not in any suggestion to remove him from the Court but to provide him once more with an Assistant.” The Government of indja went on to refer to the proposal (see above) that as Mr.Belgrave»s emoluments/4 emoluments were being slightly increased the idea of an Assistant should be dropped, and urged on Colonel Fowle that in view of air, oil, etc., developments and the undesirability of removing Mr. Belgrave from the Bench, he ahould re-examine the matter. In his reply (P.Z.2501/36) of the 22nd February 1936 Colonel Fowle said that in view of the desirability (to whiah he had referred in his letter of 18th March quoted above) of making the Bahreinis administer for themselves he was not in favour of this proposal - at any rate for the present. The appointment of an Assistant would mean that the Bahrein Government instead of doing more for themselves would do less. “Moreover the various problems connected with Bahrein Administration need the personal attention of Mr. Belgrave and not that of an Assistant. The addition of an Assistant wouldcost the State an appreciable sum in salary, and would doubtless not be popular. If, however, in spite of these objections I find that in the future such an appointment is necessary I shall not fail to recommend it.” The Government of India in their reply of March 26th said they were content to leave the matter to Colonel Fowle’s discretion. There the matter rested until it was raised by Mr. Belgrave during the Sheikh's visit. It has now also been raised by the Government of India in their demi official letter of the 27th August (P.Z.6618/36) in which it is suggested that if colonel Fowle is induced to review his opinion some junior officerbf the political Department on deputation would be a suitable person to be Assistant (they have nobody definite in mind).Foreign and Political Department, Simla, The 27 f August 1936.

My dear Fowle, I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter dated the 18th December 1934 from Belgrave about the proposed improve ment iiihis terms of service, which we discussed during your recent visit to Bahrain. 2. We agreed that the conditions of Belgrave’s appoint ment have so changed and the responsibility so increased that an improvement is fair. In view of the signing of the Mining Lease it is reasonable to think that the State will be able to bear the cost. 3. Belgrave asks for improvement in (a) his pay, (b) his passage concession, and (c) his Provident Fund. 4. After discussion we agreed on the following views:- (i) That an improvement in the Provident Fund on the ' ground jbut forward by Belgrave would be difficult to support and would be likely to give rise to similar demands from elsewhere which it would be hard to resists it was therefore decided to recommend an improvement only in the form of pay. (ii) That the proposed improvement in the Passage Concession can be made with the result of a small saving to the State and can be recommended in the best interests both of the State and of the individual• (iii) That it was undesirable to give the proposed improvement in ^ay in the form of an immediate increase of Rs. 200 /- a month as to do so might give an handle to propaganda against the Adviser; and that the improvement had better be given by making that increment in his time scale (at present Rs.800-50-2200) Rs.lQO/- with effect from the increment due at the beginning of this (Arabic^ year. This proposal has the further advantage of giving a benefit which increases as (it is to be hoped) the oil royalties increase. (iv) That if the pay of the appointment of Adviser were to be raised, it would be inadvisable to create a post of Assistant to the Adviser and that, as Mr.Luard is not available, the proposal should be dropped and an attempt be made to place responsibilities/ The Hon'ble Lt.Col.T.C.Fowle, C Political Resident in •B.E., the Persian Gulf i Bushire•-2 responsibilities for some of the work now done by the Adviser on to others and to add to his higher clerical staff. 5. Pay . I enclose a statement ♦A* showing the effect of the improvement in pay (i) as proposed by Belgrave, and (ii) as it will be if the increment is increased and the Provident Fund proposal dropped. It will be seen that on the assumption that Belgrave will serve for another ten years, the latter will give him Rs.1615/- more than his own proposal, bit is not so beneficial in the earlier years. It, however, avoids the sudden increase at the beginning before the full effect of oil development is felt. Belgrave accepts the change. 6 . Passages . I also attach a statement*B* showing the cost to the State of allowing Belgrave to go Home for four months and ten days (the time of air passage there and back) every second year, with half a fare for his wife. There is a slight saving of money to the State. 7. I recommend that the political Agent should be autnorised to place the matter before the Shaikh. Yours sincerely, sd. G.LOCH.

My dear Victor, Your letter of December 1st about Jock Luard. I have ascertained that on September 24th the Government of India and the Sheikh, having been consulted and having agreed to the appointment, the India Office wrote officially to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, at Loch’s request, asking whether they would have any objection to the appointment of assistant to Belgrave at Bahrain being offered to Jock. The company replied that they found themselves unable to release Jock from his engagement to them, without stating their reasons. I enclose a copy of their letter for your information. 2. This letter was, however, preceded by oral explanations at the India Office (I think fror Gass) to the effect that it might embarrass the company in their relations with the Persians if one of their former employees were to be employed. V.A.L. Mallet, &amp;8q. , 0.M.G* , British Legation, Tehran.- 2 - eiaployed in Bahrain. L&amp;ithwaite, who is my informant, is clear that they based their reluctance to let him go on this and not on the risk of possible misunderstandings among the Arabs. It may be that Jock misunderstood Elkington, or that Ga&amp;s misunderstood Elkington, or that the company are apprehensive on both scores 5 upon the whole their apprehensions with regard to the Persians seem rather more reasonable than their apprehensions with regard to the Arabs. 3. In any case the India Office accepted as final the statement that Jock could not be released (they gathered that this meant he would not be free for a year or more) and for that reason did not give muc 1 consideration to the additional question of how far the company’s oral representa tions were justified. They accordingly informed Loch that Jock could not be released, and added that Fowle, who wee then on leave and knew about the oral representations, would bring further explanations. The India Office are not veiy clear as to what the present position is in regard to the filling of this post. They are under the impression that the pressure....-3- pressure on Belgrave is severe and that the local authorities will be anxious to find somebody to help him out as soon as possible* They have also heard rumours that other names are being considered, but have so far taken no action in the matter themselves, as the appointment is one which does not concern them until the very latest stage. 4* As regards the question of the company^ veto, there is of course no such thing. On the other hand, it is always open to the Company to represent to His Majesty's Government that any proposed course of action on their part, such as the employment of one of their company's former employees in a particular place, is likely to be prejudicial to their interests; and if they do so the representations must be considered on their merits. In the present case it is difficult to say how either the Foreign Office or the India Office would regard the company's contention that Jock's employment at Bahrain would be a cause of suspicion either to the Persians or the Arabs; so much would depend on the exact nature of their arguments (of which we have only the bare outline at present). The company may of coursecourse be in a much better position to judge the probable Persian reaction to an appointment such as this than we ere* but, subject to that, at first sight neither the Eastern Department generally nor Laithwaite personally can see why Jock’s employment at Bahrain should matter to anyone* provided that he had really and truly severed his connexion with the company. X suppose that in fact if other difficulties were overcome it might be possible to arrange for a short interval to elapse between his leaving the company’s service and his appearing in Bahrain. b. There is no objection to your telling Jock that the India Office have been told by the Company that he is serving under contract with them* and they are not prepared to release him; and that* though the India Office do not know what the present position is, they imagine that tin local authorities must be turning over in their minds the possibility in these circumstances of finding someone else for the job# He can then decide for himself whether or not to tell Fowle and Loch that he is free to leave the company's service at three months' notice, notwithstanding the company's letter.-5- 6. But the question of what Jock should do if Fowle and Loch reply 'very well, come along in three months* tiae f * is much more difficult. ¥e cannot guarantee that if the company then renewed their representations, these representa tions might not prove on a detailed examination to have more substance than they appear to have at present; nor can we guarantee that even if we and Laithwaite considered the apprehensions of the company to be Quite groundless our views would be shared by the higher authorities in either office. 7. I can only suggest that yoxi might tell Jock, as from yourself, that it seems to you that Silking ton *3 objections would have been more intelligible If he had said 'Persians' instead of 'Arabs'; and that it is just conceivable that the employment of an ex-Anglo Persian Oil Company man in Bahrein might be a cause of complaint, however misguided and silly, by the Persians; you could add that it is obviously impossible for any private company to have a right of veto on the acts of the government (or of the Sheikh of Bahrain), but that if a company of the standing of the /iglo-Persian Oil Company telle the government that a certain course of action will be prejudicialr' —6— pi*e judicial to its interests the government naturally has to consider their representations very carefully; and that while officials at home to whom you have put the point in quite an abstract and general way do not themselves see any reason for thinking that the employment of an ex-Anglo Persian Oil Company man in Bahrain need necessarily cause difficulty to either His Majesty’s Government or the company* they cannot commit themselves in advance in regard to arguments which they have not heard. 8* X am very sorry personally for Jock* though I should have thought the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was a good thing to be in (incidentally I am surprised that Slkington was able to raise the wages of one of the company’s employees off his own bat* I imagined their salaries* rises* etc** were fixed as those of a civil servant). Elkington had of course no right to speak as he did* but we can hardly take the matter up with the company without making Jock’s position with them untenable* (Signed) L.

I enclose a copy of Mallet’s letter to me and a draft of a reply. Please let me know if you concur. J.G.Laithwaite, Esq., India Office.COPY. /“'N BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRA1T. VERY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL. December 1st 1934. My dear Lacy, Here is rather an odd story for you. You perhaps know that Jock Luard has for some months 'been in the running for a job as assistant to Belgrave at Bahrein. I don’t quite know how Jock heard of the job, but as early as last February vdien I was at Bahrein Loch asked me about him, and later in July, I think, he wrote to me for a 'character' of Luard. Yhen Loch came up here he saw him and liked him, and after that all steps were put in hand and a contract drawn up for the Bahrein Govt, to engage him. Meanwhile Luard had not mentioned the matter to the A.P.O.C., as he didn’t want them to hear about the idea until it was certain that he would have the refusal of the Bahrein job, for fear it might prejudice his future with the company if they got the idea he was dis contented. However as soon as the thing seemed settled, Luard applied to the A.P.O.C. to release him from his contract, which actually has, I think, another year to run. Under the terms of the contract he was entitled to give notice of three months to terminate, forfeiting of course the right to have his journey home paid. At//-“N At this point Elkington let him know that he would not he allowed to leave them to take the Bahrein job; so off he went to Abadan and there he found that Elkington took the line that the Company could not have one of its ex-employees working in the Gulf, as the Arabs would never believe that he wasn’t still working for the company. Jock argued that it must surely be for the Bahrein people to take this into consideration, but he soon gave up arguing as it was made clear to him that the Company would get a veto interposed in London; I suppose the idea was that Cadman would go to you or the India Office and get you to over-ride Powle and Loch v/ho had been trying to engage Jock. Finally Elkington asked Luard whether he wasn’t content with his position in the Company and on getting the answer 'No” at once offered him £200 a year extra salary to stay on with them. Luard has perforce had to accept this, though his heart was very much in the Bahrein plan; he says that he doesn’t consider himself bound to Elkington and if he felt sure that Elk was only bluffing him he would have no hesitation even now in cancelling his contract and joining Belgrave. Now the point is 'Was Elk bluffing - or are we to 'believe that the Company have these dictatorial powers as regards who shall and who shall not work in Govt.services or/'or the services of the Sheikhs in the Gulf?' Jock hasn f t quite asked me to find this out in so many words, hut he has asked me for advice, and I’m hlessed if I know what to tell the poor lad; so far I’ve only said that I thought he had acted wisely in howing to the inevitable. But I should he very interested to know what you think of this tale and whether you - in an official capacity - approve of the Company’s point of view. Do send me a line, and say in it whether I may or may not pass on its substance to our friend Luard. (Signed) Victor (Llallet)IE.7544/G tiz &lt;i 1 1 ' 1,'lZ 1*'+**^ ^.Vr y ~*‘ t5T ^ ! .

My dear Metcalfe, Will you kindly refer to my letter No.682-d, dated the 18th July 1934, recommending the appointment of an Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. 2. It is not easy to fill a post of this kind, for which special qualities are needed, but I have had recommend ed to me a candidate (Mr. J.M. Luard, now working for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Tehran), who appears very well suited to the appointment and who has, besides other qualifi cations, a knowledge of oil practice, which should be especially valuable in connection with measuring oil for the purposes of calculating the royalty payable to The Bahrain Petroleum Company. I have made enquiries from the Legation at Tehran and have received admirable accounts of him. I should like to arrange for an offer to be made to him in the immediate future, as if Luard f s appointment falls through for any reason, it would be well for Belgrave and Fowle to be able to look out for other candidates , before they return from leave. 3.

From The Deputy Secretary to the Goverimarit of India in the Foreign and Political Department, The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Dated Simla, the August 1934. e and passage congessions for cars oT the Bahrain State. Sir, In continuation of telegram frctn the Goverrment of India in the Foreign and Political Department, No.1661, dated the 1st August 1934, I am directed to say that, having regard to the development of air transport and the fact that the European officers of the Bahrain State have to vrork under adverse climatic conditions, the Government of India would be glad of your opinion on the suggestion that sane revision might be made in the terms of the leave and passage concessions at present allowed to these officers. I am therefore to request that they may be furnished with your views on the desirability of so drawing the neur contract of Mr. Luard, and so revising the contracts of Messrs. Belgrave and de Grenier as to allow of shorter periods of leave at more frequent intervals, substituting air rates for sea passage concessions now admissible. Provided that annual leave and recess are added together it would appear that approximately four months’ leave could be taken after each twenty months service on the analogy of the concessions granted to Foreign Office officials in consular posts in Persia. Should it be thou^it that the full cost of passage by air at such frequent intervals would be beyond the capacity of the Bahrain State budget, the State might be required to pay the equivalent of concessions now granted, the officials making up the balance. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- 0. K. Caroe, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India./ \# It. No *6 82-3 of 1954 L ^ir fail Gonl ident ial. Bxif is N -Nfl.s idepcy ^ Gonsulate-3e neral, The foreign secretary to the Government of India, I have the honour to recommend the appointment of an assistant to the adviser to the Bahrain Government. performed hy one man. Nvery endeavour has been made to delegate his worK to members of the Buling family and others, but owing to lach of education there is no one who can undertake a great part of the adviser's duties, which include complicated work connected with, for example, oil and air developments and can only be carried out by a man of education and trained intelli gence. It is well to remember that Bahrain has sprung in the .last decade from complete ooscurity and almost bedouin rule to a State administered on modern, ii xirab, lines, and the last three years have seen an oil field come into being with all the changes and difficulties which that implies. Protection, control of foreign affairs and Jurisdiction over foreigners is in our hands and it is essential to our position that the administration should be properly conducted. 3. Some two years ago it was found necessary, for financial reasons, to dispense with the services of the Commandant of Police and to add responsibility for the Suspire, the ibthJuly 1954 The Hon* i rQ 3 4 Ho n • b IV- Lie-ute-rrsirtr Go 1 o ne 1 Gor do n Lo ch, I. . Officiating Political Besident in the Persian Gulf. To Sir 2 The Adviser has much more work than can be training/training and administration oi the Bahrain armed Police and of the Body of Nature (armed watchmen) to the duties performed By the Adviser. The present Adviser has done the duties well (and has Been aBle to do them owing to his long experience of Bahrain) But they add a consider- aBle Burden to an already overworked post. 4. It/ is, moreover, inevitaBle that the work of the Adviser should continue to increase owing to the opening up of Bahrain, to increased means oi communica tion, to the development of an oil field, and to the fact that other neighbouring Governments (’IraQ., Najd and Persia) have adopted to a greater or less extent western methods in conducting their affairs. 5. Mr. Belgrave, the present adviser, has Been gravely overworked, and the grant of the leave, which he is now enjoying, was essential to preserve his health, otherwise I should have Been loath to agree to the temporary arrangements that have Been made. An Assistant is required not only to relieve the adviser of work, But also to ensure continuity in the absence of the the Adviser on leave, which must Be given fairly frequently in the climatic and otherwise trying conditions of Bahrain. 6. I would emphasise that the proposed appoint ment does not signify any desire to westernizse Bahrain. On the contrary, though some years ago we were compelled to interfere drastically and to introduce widespread reforms, every endeavour has Been made to create an administrative machine suited to and worked By the Puling family and their people, for example, a kind oi Executive Council of the Al Khalil'ah is gradually coming into Being and local men are employed so far as it is possible to do so in all Branches of the admin is tration.7. The possibility ol employing an Arab as assistant to the Adviser has been considered, but there is no local man suitable tor the appointment and it would be most unwise to employ an Arab from oyria or elsewhere, as his appointment would arouse a resentment which would not be felt in the case of a British Assistant, and to do so would be politicals ly imprudent because of the special interests which we have in Bahrain. 8. The more important or the terms proposed for the appointment are 800-50-2,000. Rs.200/- a month. Pay Provident Bund Accommoda tion Leave Pass age s. A free furnished house or an allowance of Rs.100/- a month in lieu thereof. furlough it months for each year of approved active service. Annual leave to be taken out of Bahrain one month a year ( can be accomulated up to two months). free passage to the United Kingdom after every 2i years* service at the rate of a second class passage by the Overland Bo ute. Fedical Attendence at State expense. fe rmina tion Three months* motice on either side. a contract will be made on the lines of those concluded with the Adviser, the Director of Customs and Port Officer and the late Commandant of Police. 9. There is no question of any difficulty over the financial aspect of the appointment, so long as the oil field continues in commercial production. 10. I understand indirectly that His Axcellency Shaixh Hamad bin *Isa a 1 Khalifah considers the appo intme nt/appointment necessary and Lieutenant-Colonel iowle agrees that the appointment is necessary, hut directed me to submit the proposal to the Government of India before approaching the Shaikh on the subject. I hope that in the circumstances which I have explained I may be authorised to arrange the matter in consultation with the Shaikh. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- G.

Dear Laithwaite, I enclose a copy of a letter which I have sent to Ballentyne. His suggestion interested me only from a financial point of view as I believe the Company would be prepared to pay heavily to obtain me. I do not wish to appear mercenary at this juncture but I have been intending for some time to make a request for a revision in the rates of my pay and certain conditions in my contract. My work and responsibilities in Bahrain have increased a very great deal since I first served there and in addition to this the cost of living is now much higher than it used to be, mainly owing to the Oil Company. I am loath to ask Shaikh Hamed for a rise in pay as I know quite well that if I asked even for something quite unreasonable he would almost certainly grant it. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

Reference No- SECRET 35 , Old Queen Street, London, S.W.i. 7th April, 1934. hear Y/arner, I enclose herewith copy of a^l^ber from halrymple Belgrave to a eminent ex-official in this country. There is nothing particularly secret in the contents, but as neither the writer nor the recipient know that it is in the possession of His Majesty’s Government, perhaps it had better be treated as a secret document. V/ould you very kindly send it on safely to Donaldson when you have read it ? Yours ever. C.F.A.Warner Esq.,COPY I ought to*have written a long time before to thank you for your letter and to tell you how greatly ’I appreciated it. I have had a lot to do lately and expect to be even more busy during the next month before I go on leave on 20th April. It is the end of the Arabic year and I have a great many things to do before I go away. I have sent my family home ahead of me, today they must be nearing Constantinople, and they will stay at Montreux until the middle of April and then go to my father-in-law^ house at Brighton until I arrive. In May we hope to get a small house in London for about two or three months and I look forward to seeing you and then. A few days ago, I met someone who you used to know quite well in Egypt - a Mr.Knabenshue (I am vague about the spelling). He is now the United States Minister in Iraq and came here for a week on his way to Muscat where he was going on a mission to visit the young Sultan on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the treaty between Muscat and America. I liked him very much, we had many friends in common in Egypt and he was not so aggressively American as most of the oil people. We talked much of you and he said how much he would like to see you again. He and his son and a secretary hoped to go across to visit Ibn Saud but, as fre quently happens, they received no reply from Ibn Saud so eventually they had to go on to Muscat by the mail boat. He was the guest of the head man of the Oil Company and his wife and they gave several dinners to meet 'His Excellency' and I was amused to hear that the emphasis on the 'Excellency' very • • •- 2 - very much annoyedi all the Americans here* I really !o not know if it was correct or not* The first oil tanker arrived here from California about a month ago* 1 saw a cutting from an American paper about it. They wrote a most ridiculous description of conditions here, describing Bahrain as a sort of savage island full of wild Arabs with some very rude remarks about 'the old Shaikh 1 ' • I thought that it was intended to be a comic description but X v\o.s told that this was not the case* She brought material for the pipe line and when this is completed the ship will take away the first cargo of oil. I believe that the oil is to be sold to Japan. There are now about sixty Englishmen and Americans working here for the Company and it is definitely known that the oil field is a proved success* It is a relief to me as for the last year or two I have been very worried at the prospect of the State becoming insolvent. Eor some time the revenue has been rapidly decreasing owing to the slump in the pearl trade but when we begin to get royalties on the oil we shall be quite rich. I regret more and more that it is not a British Company. like everywhere else, Bahrain is being flooded with Japanese goods. A few years ago there wis very little Japanese stuff in the bazaar, now there is hardly anything else. The Arabs are so badly off that it suits them but neither the merchants or the public have a good opinion 01 the Japanese imports, the merchants find that what they buy fran Japan one day can be imported even more cheaply next day so that they lose money. The Arabs have coined a new word n Japani vlT meaning anything that is cheap and second-rate. But all the same they buy the stuff as they cannot afford anything better • ••-3- better. We hear very little of Ibn Sand these days except that he is very short of money. He has raised the customs duties on his Arab ports in some cases to 500^, with the result that he kills the goose that lays the golden eggs. In Kuwait, I hear that the A.P.O.C. and the American Company who have been trying to get an oil con cession from the Shaikh for some years have now combined instead of bidding against each other and in the next few weeks it is likely that a concession will be given to a joint Company. Shaikh Ahmed A1 Jabr, the Ruler of Kuwait, is a clever man with modern ideas and more than a match for the concession hunters. The Persians continue to be as aggressive as before. The difficulty is that we have to treat them as a civilised nation which they are not. They disregard all the rules of ordinary diplomatic usage. The Sha&lt;i^refuses to meet any of the foreign ministers and all the conversation has to be with the Persian Ministers who are so terrified of their master that they dare not tell him anything which would displease him. The consequence is that nothing is done. I have just seen an article in the Cairo paper Mokattam about Bahrain and mostly about myself. Although this time it does not abuse me personally, the whole article is so violently anti-English and implies that I, though in the service of the Shaikh, am the tool of the wicked English Grovernment. As a matter of fact, in some ways, it is true2 I hope when we get some revenue from oil that I shall be able to t ake on an assistant which I need badly. I had to get rid of the English police officer two years ago ...ago owing to the need of economy and since then I have been running the Police. I have made a new police force of locally enlisted men and they have turned out very well, there is a sprinkling of Swahilis and Sudanis and manumitted slaves among them. I am really very proud of them. General Hay, the head of the Military Mission to Iraq, was here the other day and he had a look at them and was very pleased with them. I am looking forward very much to getting home. I hope to do some more research work at the British Museum Library while I am in London as some day I want to write a book about Bahrain. I have dug up a good deal of local history about the place. I wonder whether you will be in London in May and June. Yours sincerely, (SIGNED) C.DALRYMPLB BELGRATE•- 2 - Balgrave for the carrying on of the latter’s work during his absence seem adequate, ana in addition - as Colonel Loch points out in paragraphs 6 ana 7 of his letter - provide a wholesoae opportunity for the Shaikh ana the i.uling Fa&amp;ily, within the limits of certain fc&amp;iefeUarua, to exercise more responsiDility in managing their own internal afikirs. sd.

Political Agency, Eanrain,tiie Sutn January 1934* i.0.Ko:Q/2Z-b/l Dear Colonel Fowle, r#C.I.Belgravt l AOTiser to tne Baiir&amp;in Government, proposes to apply to ,ia ^ ceilency i; tenth E&amp;ataa bin ’lea Al rbaliran ter leave lor seven months iroa tne beginning ot April to October 1934. I consider tiiat it is essential tfc&amp;t r.Eelgrave should get t «&amp;y lor a spell ol leave. Bis work lor the Gt&amp;ie is worthy ol the highest aamiration,hut he has been greatly overworked,especially during tne past two years,owing to the fact that he has held the post ol Commandant ol loiice m addition to his own duties, it is very much in our interests tnat he should have leave m order to preserve ms health,lor we should find it naru to obtain another Officer with his qualities and guaiilications for tne post. 3. A copy is enclosed of a auau-afiiciai letter Ao:C/109 datec the loth leeember 1033,in which r.5elgravt,at my request, has Biade suggestions lor dealing with the work during his absence. 4. The appointment oi a substitute,or of &amp; Commandant of !olice,who could also temporarily ta^e ensrge oi the post ol Adviser,is impossible at present owi% to the linsncial stringency o. Ihe eaaential points in *?r.heljrave f s proposals may be aumiiariaeu as follows:- ; imnce . The budget of 3333 will be prepared by r.delgrave sna be approved by his Excellency Shai/.h ^smad before r.helgrave leaves. ' ayments will be made strictly according to the budget ana will oe supervised by r.ae remer ^tne . irector of Customs;, i /whowho will have orders to report to the Political Agent should any dilTiculty arise. I agree that accounts should be sent to the Political Agent monthly. haw and Order . The Police will be under the direct orders of His Excellency haiKii Hamad,but the work will be done by the Police Officer,Kaji Salman,ana the Political Agent will keep a close watch on the Force. The «lail will be under the Police Officer and arrangements will be made for the etical Officer-in-charge, Victoria i emorial Hospital to visit it at regular intervals. Land ReKistration lepartment . The Supervisor of the i^and department will hold charge and will have orders to report to the oiitical „gent in case of any attempt to evade the land regul ations, especially by embers of the Huling Family. 'umcipalities . She residents (who are brothers of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad) will be m charge ol the Municipalities. The Political -.gent,who himself sits with them from time to time, will keep a watch on important matters. education . Shaikh T Abcullsh bin f Is&amp; a! Khalifah is in charge of the Lepartment,but the inspector of Education will do the practical work,and the Political agent will watch matters. «iudicial . Shaixh Salman should be -^uite capable of carrying on the work of the Bahrain Court (the senior State Court),but I agree that a younger relative should sit with him. The opportunity is an admirable one to test Shaikh Salman with a view to his doing the work in future without the Adviser to help him. lie will be given an increase in pay for his mcreasea responsibilities (which will incidentally be an excellent way of settling certain difficulties over his present allowances,into which I need not go here;. Perhaps I should add that the Political Agent (or a Joint Court of the Political Agent ana His Excellency Shaikh Hamad)has jurisdiction in cases in which British subjects and Foreigners are concerned. Customs . Mr. de Grenier is well able to deal with Custoras matters and is in close touch with the Political Agent. 6. 1 would emphasise tnat the Political Agent will not interfere openly in any matter,if it can be avoided,but will keep in close touch behind the scenes. There will no doubt be some falling off m what we call efficiency,but we gain an opportunity of letting the Ruling Family show their capabilities,and so of enabling us,I hope,m the luture to delegate to them some of the work of the much overworked adviser, ^ven il they prove inefficient,the time will not be long enough for,I trust,any real derangement of the administration. It will be seen that the financial arrangements are so made that no attempt can be made to spend money,other than the usual monthly salaries and other fixeu payments,without inform ation of it coming to the knowleuge of the Political Agent. ?. A most important point is that contained in the ninth paragraph of r.Belgrave’s letter,that is to say,that in the case of important matters,financial,oil or political,His Excellency Shaikh Hamad should be asked to discuss the question at issue with his brothers,Shaikhs Muhammad and T Abdullah,and his son, Shaikh Salman. This is already done in practice to a large extent,and to do so as regular procedure during tuis period would tend to place on a recognised basis an existing general practice, and so gradually to provide the i~tate with a kma of executive Council of their own design. 8. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad must,I think,manage his own private money affairs himself (unless he asks ^r.de Grenier to help him),and i will endeavour to see that he does not embark on any expensive project such as building mosques.4 4. iW 9. in the circumstances I trust tnat there is no objection to His Excellency Shaikh Lamad granting to kr.Belgrave, the leave for which he asks and which he certainly requires. I would ask for early orders as ir.Belgrave has not yet approached His excellency Shaikh Iiamad,who is,however,unlikely to raise any objection. lours sincerely, Sd/- G.Loch, The Honourable Lieut-Golonel T.C.d.Fowle,C«B#E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Confide ntlaI .

Bear Colonel loch, I make the following suggestions for dividing up my duties v/hen i am on leave next summer. i should like if possible to get away early in April and to return in October. 2. FINANCES. The Budget for 1353 will oe prepared by me and approved by Shaikh Hamecioefore I leave. I will also prepare the Annual Deport. Current monthly patient^ LlJC h as oalarifcC, Ci^il List, Municipal *rd Education ctllo^iances will be paid automatically as usual oy the Bank. Other payments such as Police, Bepaitment 0 ! Staffs ^tc. will be made strictly according to the ftate Budget and the vaxious separate budgets which axe prepared for eacn department. DeGr© ier v.i llbe authorised to make all necessary payments, which are usually made oy cheque, according to the Budget. He will operate on the Consolidated Fund ax. the Deposit Account, wa he will also supervise the accounts in my office and submit the monthly returns to you. I suggest that during my absence the returns snoula be sent to you monthly, not every three months as at present, so that you will constantly be aware of the financial position of the State. I think most likely, in spite of the additional monthly revenue from the Oil Company, that there will be very little margin next year between the Revenue and the Expenditure, which is perhaps all for the best. Payment s/Payments of royalty unaer the oil concession are payable half yearly so any royalty on tne oil •which may be shipped in July will not be received until after my return. The State f s reserve is on fixed deposit in Bombay aau I wi-l arrange to xe-invest the one amount of tais sum which is due to fall due while I am away before I leave, otherwise it mignt be suggested that this money shouId be spent which as things are now I think would be unwise. We are not sure of a certain income from the oil royalty after July although it seems to be probable. PROTECTION, POLICE ana NATTJRS. 2. The Police Officer, Hsji Sulman, will be in command of the Police under the direct orders of Shaikh Hamad. The police are a newly formed force and I feel myself that they need constant attention. If they are allowed to get aishc slack it will take time to bring them up to the mark again. Though Shaikh Hamad is interested in them he does not in the least appreciate the importance of strictness anc discipline and attention to details. If you could occasionally have a look at them when they are on parade ana also mention any cases of slackness or bad conduct which you might happen to notice to Ha.} i Sulman it would be a great help. Hs;j i Sulman ix will also be in charge of tne jail which contains foreign as well as Bahrain prisoners. It might be advisable for the M.0. to visit it at regular intervals on behalf of the Agency. At present I do this myself and when necessary I ask the M.O. to come round with me. The naturs will be under the orders of Haji Sulman but controlled as at present by the Amirs of Manama and Muharraq. The Rafaa naturs are unaer tne Amir of Rafaa and those at Budeya are under Haji Aobas. LAND REGISTRATION DEPARTMENT./-3- land registration department. 3- kr.Mohammed Khalil, the Supervisor of the .band Deptt. will ueal with this Department. ^e has woeked in it for eight years ana is very capable. it is in my opinion an extremely important branch ol the administration and one which is liable to frequent pressure by persons, usually members of the *ulins Family, who wish to upset former registrations or to register property illegally, the slightest deviation from the land regulations, which are very well known, is liable to injure the whole land registration system. It is easy for me to keep an eye on this department and to uphold the validity of registered titles. 1 think it is likely that while I am away there may oe difficulties over land questions, j^o hammed jxhalil is extremely sensible but without some support his position is liable at times to be difficult, it would be a great help if he could be a ole to reier to you, privately, any difficult questions which may crop up. ke is sensible and his discretion may be relied upon. The official title deeds are not issued until after proclamation calling for claims to the property, they are signed hy ohaikh Earned, the Ruler, and myself as controlling the Lana Department. During my absence they will be signed by the xoiler only. Municipalities. 4 . ihese will work as usual under the two Presidents. I suggest that they send you a cony of tUe ag/enda of each meeting and of the decisions. Possibly they do this now. They have a tendency to assume privileges which they have no right to such/- 4 - as such^authority to impose taxation other than municipal house taxes etc. oHIA WAKJT DEPARTMENT. 5. The Meglis will have to carry on hy itself. If they ho get into difficulties there is nofcody who can help them, -‘■he Shaikhs are not interested or sympathetic to them as they are concerned solely with Shia wakfs. 6. ELECTRIC SUPPLT DEPARTMENT. Steele is going on leave at the same time as 1 propose going. I am arranging for a temporary substitute from gallenders Cable Coy. 7. EDUCATION. Shaikh Abdulla, as minister of Education, will be responsible for the aJax schools, the practical work of insnecting and managing them will as usual be done by the Inspector of Education, kr.Adham. If you n could occasionally walk through one of the schools it would be helpful. 8. JUDICIAL. Shaikh Sulmam will sit in the Bahrain Court and I shall suggest that one of his relations should sit with him. ne is fully capable of doing the work. I think it would be inadvisable to ask Shaikh Mohammed or Abdulla to sit with him as that would mean bhat he would automatically have to concur with his elder relation's opinion, it would be oetter if a junior member of the family sat with him. 9. In case of imnortant financial, otol or political matters 1 suggest that Shaikh Hamad should be informed and asked to discuss the matter with his brothers albcL/and ShaiKh Suliaan. This is fche present practice and works very saccessfully• 10* Shaikh Hamad's Money affairs. At 'present 1 deal with all Shaikh Hamad's money affairs. 1 hope that hy the time 1 go on leave he will he out of debt. About six months ago he owed nearly Hs. 40,000/- but this amount is gradually being paid off. If he would like de Orenier to assist him in this matter he can do so otherwise he will have to manage his own affairs while I am on leave.

In matters concerning customs, landing Company shipping etc. etc. I suggest that de Orenier should be consulted, he is well experienced in these matters. 12. The possibilities which I am afraid of are, an attack on the Reserve Fund, attempts to increase the Civil List by reducing other expenses such as Education, kunicinalities Police etc etc in order to add to some of the present salaries, pressure being brought on the Land Department in such auestion^s Xka as the Khalifah 'hibas”, and unfair decisions by the Meglis Tajara in cases against divers.

Sir Hugh Biscoe was of opinion that Mr. Belgrave should receive an allowance of Rs* 200/- per mensan for this additional duty but decided in the interests of economy that such allowance should not take effect until the expiry of the leave due to Captain Parke. For this reason and as the Government of India had not then accorded their approval to the proposal to terminate Captain Parke's services the matter was not mentioned to the Shaikh of Bahrain. 3.

SEEN POLITIC^ ^MITTEE, Previous Papers *— ■ 4475b 1000 5.30 Colonel Barrett, in his despatch No. x 385-S of 28th August, 1929,on the question of British interference in the Bahrein Administration and the strength of the British element m that administration, recommended (paragraph 15) that the signs of British influence should be modified by the substitution of Sudanese for the Indian Police Force, and further, 'that, unless a European is required to deal with an influx of Europeans and Americans attracted by the Gulf Oil Company, the services of the European Coranandant of Police be dispensed with at the termination of his present contract'. These recommendations were generally accepted by the Secretary of State, the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office/Office, and the Government of India were informed accordingly. The Government of India, in P. 1457/30, flagged. the light of the Secretary of State’s views, instructed the Resident that the question of the retention of a British officer as Commandant of the Police might be left for consideration until it was known whether Indians were to be replaced by Sudanese or not, and asked him to forward a recommendation on the question not less than three months before the date of expiry of Captain Parke’s / contract. Endeavours to substitute a Sudanese for an Indian Police Force have since failed, while the Gulf Oil Company have commenced boring operations in the islands. Captain Parke’s contract expired on 13th November, but, for the reasons explained in the despatch, no recommendation was submitted until December of last year. The Resident then proposed that Captain Parke should be retained for at least a further year, on an indefinite contract, terminable at three months’ notice on either side. He regarded it as essential that he should remain on, at any rate until the end of next summer, when the Financial Advisor is due for leave and it is proposed that Captain Parke shall act for him. The arguments m support of this proposal are given in paragraph 3 of the Resident s letter of 10th December (passage marked A). The absence of any qualified Bahreini successor, the^impossibility of relieving the Indian police force, and the uncertainty as to the scale on which the American oil operations may develop are strong reasons for retaining a qualified European Commandant for the present; and the GovernmentMinute Paper. Department. V of India have now approved the retention of Captain Parke’s services for a further period of at least one year. Messrs. Belgrave and Parke which has also been approved by the Government of India will have the effect of placing them on an engagement for an indefinite period, subject to three months’ notice on either side.

The delay was due to an over-sight alike in the office of the Political Agent at Bahrain and in my own. 1 did not receive Captain Prior f s proposals till the end of September, and as I hoped to be going to Bahrain about the end of October, 1 thought it better to await till i had an opportunity of discussing the question of the renewal of Mr. Parke’s contract, on the spot. 3. Firstly, l would say that, in my opinion, it is very desirable to retain the services of a European police officer at -Bahrain for some time to come. There is no Bahraini who is in any way qualified to fill this post, or who could exercise the necessary control over the police force or retain the confidence of the general public. The heterogeneous nature of the population of Bahrain and ±±j the latent feuds among them render it most necessary that the State should have at its disposal an adequate force to sent as much depends on certain domestic circumstances. 2. Mr. Parke’s contract expired on the 13th Lovember maintain the peace. Mr.Parke, does not, I understand end to stay on at Bahrain very much longer, but he is filing to commit himself to any definite period at 30JAM193j! mi any case, however, he is prepared to remain on for I another year. His services hitherto have been satisfactorysatisfactory and I have been impressed with the efficiency of the force that he commands, and he has now acquired a good knowledge of the local populace, and, of course, knows the language. l therefore consider it desirable that he should be kept on, for the present at any rate. In this connection 1 would invite attention to the terms of the contracts of the three European officials in the employ of the Bahrain State. Mr. de Grenier is on an indefinite contract terminable at three months’ notice on either side. The first clause however of the contracts of both Mr. delgrave and Captain Parke are worded as follows:- 'the term of contract shall be for four years terminable by three months’ notice on either side. Thereafter the contract is renewable by mutual consent”. I confess 1 do not understand the meaning of this phraseology and it seems to me a contradiction in terms. I understand that a similar formula is adopted in the case of contracts entered into by some commercial firms with their employes, but in such cases it has reference primarily to the rate of pay to be drawn by the employe during the three or four years, as the case may be, of.his service. At the end of that period the employe can ask for better terms if he likes. In the case of the Bahrain employes however their pay is fixed on a time-scale extending over a long period of years and the phraseology adopted in the first xaixsjs clause would seem to be inapplicable. i asked Mr.Belgrave what he understood by this, and he admitted that it was quite ambiguous. 1 would therefore suggest that the contracts of both Messrs. Parke and Belgrave should be amended on the model of Mr. de Grenier’s contract and that they should be given indefinite contracts terminable at three months’ notice on either side. Mr. Belgrave informed me that he would have no objection to this. This would enable the case of Captain Parke to be suitably dealt with and he could retire when he wished to do so on giving a■ a suitable notice, while the State on their side would also oe at liberty to dispense with his services 'when no longer required. it is, I consider, essential that Mr. Parke should remain on till the end of next summer at any rate as Mr. delgrave is due for leave and Mr. Parke will act for him. An officer but recently arrived would find much difficulty in filling the combined appointments of Adviser and Commandant of the police. 4. To sum up: I recommend that the contracts of Messrs. Belgrave and Parke should be amended and that they should be engaged for an indefinite period subject to three months’ notice on either side as in the case of Mr. de Grenier and that the services of Captain Parke should be retained at any rate for one year.

The provide;^t fund of the. three British Officials of the Bahrain State is at present invested in G-overnment of India securities approved by the Hon 1 ole the Political Resident. These securities, as stated in the contracts, will be handed over to the various officials on their retirement from service with this Government.

H 8081/- The three British officials were not engaged from India, and ab it happens not one of them has any connection with India, and it is most highly improbable that when they retire they will have any wish to live in India, when they withdraw their provident funds they will wish to transfer them to England and either realise them in English currency or invest them in England. .Ve view fchi with the gravest appre hension the ijdCKJQC likelihood of a depreciation in the value of the rupee which would cause a decrease in the value of the investmentstherefore investments hy the time they were withdrawn. &lt;Q request that the funds should he transferred to British Government stock, such as b% war stock 1929- 1 47 on which income tax is not payable by residents abroad.

It is therefore incorrect to say that the officers con cerned have now the option of transferring the proceeds of their Provident Funds to British Government Stock.
