The questions for the Committee's consideration were : (1.) With reference to the Muscat subsidy:— (a) Ought the Imperial Government to pay one moiety thereof ? (b) If so, should the payment date from Eebruary 1871, when Seyyid Toorkee came to the throne, or from what other date ? (2.) With reference to the Agency and Consulate at Zanzibar: (a) Ought the Imperial Government to pay one moiety of these charges ? (j) k so, from what time should such obligation be considered to date ? from the 24ith January 1870, as claimed by the India Office, or from what later date ? (c) Upon what scale should the establish ment be maintained ? As regards the first head of their inquiry, the Committee find that on the death of Seyyid Said, Sultan of Muscat, in 1855, his dominions were divided between his sons, Seyyid Thowanee and Seyyid Majeed, the former becoming Ruler of Oman, the latter of Zanzibar. During his life Seyyid Said had been in the habit of paying tribute to the Wahabees, in the interior, the funds for the purpose being' obtained from Zanzibar, which was much richer than Oman. Accordingly, soon after Seyyid Said's death, Seyyid Thowanee applied to his brother Seyyid Majeed for money to pay the tribute and for other purposes, and the latter agreed to pay him annually a sum of 40,000 crowns. Sub sequently, owing to circumstances into which the Committee think it unnecessary to enter, the pay ment of this sum was stopped. Seyyid Thowanee thereupon threatened to go and claim payment by 18516. 1.657. A2 force of arms, and as the Arabs oi Oman are far more warlike than those of Zanzibar, there is little doubt but that he would have been able to carry his threats into effect. The Indian Government, however, interfered, fearing that a war between the brothers might revive piracy in those seas, and would seriously affect the trade of its Indian subjects established in those countries. They there fore ordered Seyyid Thowanee to desist 11 om Ins contemplated expedition, and it was ultimately agreed by the brothers that the whole question should be referred to Lord Canning, the then Governor General of India. In 1861, Lord Canning made his award, by which he formally recognized the division of territory which had become an accom plished fact, and decreed the payment by the Ruler of Zanzibar to the Huler of Muscat of a lump sum of 80,000 crowns, and an annual subsidy of half that amount (8,500/.). The annual payment was declared to be understood neither as a recognitign of the dependence of Zanzibar upon Muscat, nor as merely personal between the brothers, but to extend to their respective successors, and ' to be held to be ' a final and permanent arrangement compensating ' the Euler of Muscat for the abandonment of all ' claims upon Zanzibar, and adjusting the ' inequality between the two inheritances,' which were thenceforth to be distinct and separate. The Committee find that the subsidy was paid regularly by the Sultan of Zanzibar until the death of Sultan Seyyid Thowanee of Muscat in 1866; that from that date until October 1868, during the reign of Seyyid Salem, it was paid through the medium of the British Political Agent at Muscat, by ad vances from the Bombay Treasury recoverable from Zanzibar; that the advances during this period aggregated Es. 1,90,850, of which Us. 1,68,000 were recovered from Zanzibar; that upon the usurpation of the Muscat throne by Seyyid Azzan bin Ghez, in October 1868, the advances were dis continued ; and that, upon the accession of Sevyid Toorkee, the legitimate occupant of the throne, in February 1871, they were not resumed; that de mands for payment, addressed by Seyyid Toorkee to the Sultan of Zanzibar, met with no attention; and that the connection of the Government of India with the subsidy was closed, for the time, by an order passed to the Accounts Department in Oc tober 1872 to write off as a bad debt the balance of Bs. 22,850 due from Zanzibar to the Indian Trea sury on account of the advances made in the vears 1866—1868. ^ Such was the.position of affairs at the period of Sir Bartle Prere's mission in 1873 for the organiza- tion of measures for the more effectual suppression ot the .East African slave trade. It was recognized that, in order to attain the object in view, it would be necessary to conclude treaties with the Sultans of Zanzibar and Muscat, and that, in the course of the negotiations, the question of the subsidy could scarcely fail to be raised. Sir Bartle Erere, asEnvoy of. the Imperial Government, received his instructions from Lord Granville, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. As regards the subsidy, they were couched in the following terms :— ' In the event of your finding that it will faci- ' litate your negotiations with the Sultan of Zanzibar to relieve His Highness from the obli- gation to pay to Muscat the subsidy of 40,000 ' crowns, under the award approved by Lord ' Canning in April 1861, you are authorized to c£ give the Sultan such assurances as may satisfy ' him that the payment of the subsidy will not be &lt;c enforced against him, provided he consents to &lt;c enter into the engagements which you will pro- ' pose to him for the more effectual suppression of the East African slave trade. * ^ « On the ' other hand, you are empowered, on similar con- ' ditions, to give similar assurances to the Ruler ' of Muscat that the amount to which he may be ' entitled under the aforesaid award will be regu- ' larly paid to him from Her Majesty's Treasury, ' Bombay.' It was agreed that the cost of the mission should be shared between the Imperial and Indian Go vernments, and the Secretary of State for India in Council further undertook to pay one half of the Muscat subsidy should it be found necessary, on the one hand, to relieve the Euler of Zanzibar from his liability on that account, and, on the other, to guarantee its punctual payment to the Ruler of Muscat. In furtherance of his mission, Sir Bartle Erer^ went to Zanzibar, but as the Sultan would not enter into the proposed arrangements, no engage ment was made to relieve him from his obligation to pay the subsidy. The Sultan of Muscat, on the other hand, at once signed the Treaty presented for his acceptance. The Treaty contained no stipula tion in regard to the subsidy, but Sir Bartle Erere promised to lay the matter before the Home and Indian Governments, and as the Sultan was at the time pressed for money, authorized him to draw at once on the Political Agent at Muscat for 40,000 dollars (being one year's arrears which were due from the date of his accession in Eebruary 1871), and at the expiration of three months, for a further sum of 20,000 dollars, being half the subsidy due for the current year, unless other measures for settling the question were taken in the interim. In a Memorandum, dated the 3rd May 1873, primarily addressed to the Government of India, but communicated also to the Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs, Sir Bartle Erere, in reporting the above measure, thus wrote : — &lt;e It would have been ' within the letter of my instructions to have given ' His Highness at once a distinct assurance that ' the subsidy would be regularly paid to him from ' Her Majesty's Treasury at Bombay, but I thought ' the assurance would come with more effect from ' His Excellency the Viceroy, and I wished to' comply with the obvious wish of His Highness, « that the two questions of slave trade and suhsi y « should be kept clearly distinct and separate. As regards the future, Sir Bartle Frere, in the same Memorandum, wrote:—' I would subm t, 01 « consideration of His Excellency the Viceroy, that 'the Government of India should assure His 'Highness, by autograph letter from His Exocl- ' lencv the Viceroy, that the Zanzibar subsidy will 'be regularly paid, with all arrears, from the « Bombay Treasury to His Highness s Agent in ' Bombay as long as His Highness abstains from ' all aggressions on Zanzibar, and observ os t je « obligations he and his predecessors have entered ' into regarrling the suppression of the slave tC ' In a' letter dated 2nd May 1873, forwarding to the Viceroy of India the Memorandum from which the above extracts have been taken, bir Bartie Frere thus expressed himself :—' ... I would « submit, for the consideration of your Excellency, ' that a decision in the course to be taken by Her ' Majesty's Government regarding the Muscat sub- ' sidy due from Zanzibar should be arrived at with &lt;J as little delay as possible, and that if your Excel- ' lency approves of the views 1 have taken, they ' should be at once acted on, so far as relates to an ' immediate assurance of payment of all arrears to ' the Sultan of Muscat, whose administration I ' have reason to believe is seriously embarrassed 4 by want of funds.' On receipt of this letter the Government of India, on the 9th June 1873, autho rized the Political Agent at Muscat to make the following communication to the Sultan, Seyyid Toorkee ;—' It affords the Viceroy and Governor General in Council much satisfaction to guarantee ' to His Highness the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy of 40,000 crowns, with arrears from the date of His Highness's accession to the throne of ' Muscat in February 1871, and to assure His ' Highness that, so long as he continues faithfully &lt;f to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his ' friendship towards the British Government, the subsidy of 40,000 crowns will be paid to him ' annually during his rule.' The Government of India reported their pro ceedings to the Secretary of State in a letter dated the 9th June 1873, in which they observed, . . . 'We must leave it to Her Majesty's Government ' to determine the steps to be taken for the reco- ' very of the subsidy from Zanzibar. . . . We ' understand that if any portion of the sums now, ' or hereafter, advanced to Seyyid Toorkee on 44 account of the subsidy be not eventually recovered ' from Zanzibar, the half of such unrecovered ad- ' vances will be repaid to us by Her Majesty's ' Imperial Government.' This letter was com municated by the Secretary of State for India to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on the 29th July 1873, with a remark that the Duke of Argyll understood it to have been decided from thefirst that tliG expensGS referred to would be shared between the Imperial and Indian Treasuries. The Committee find that, in pursuance of the assurance given to Seyyid Toorkee by the Political Agent at Muscat, the balance of arrears due to His Highness from the date of his accession in February 1871 was paid to him in August 1873; that the sum of 40,000 crowns a year has been regularly disbursed since that date from the Bombay Treasury; and that no portion of the amount so paid has been recovered from the Sultan of Zanzibar, although His Highness has not been formally relieved of his obligations in reference to the subsidy under Lord Canning's award. In view of the facts above recited the Com mittee are of opinion that, so long as the Sultan of Muscat fulfils his treaty engagements in re spect to the slave trade, the Imperial Govern ment {a) is bound to pay one half of the subsidy guaranteed to His Highness in 1873 by the Govern ment of India, acting at the instance of Her Majesty's Special Envoy, and (5) is, consequently, bound to reimburse the Indian Treasury one half of the payments which have already beeo made to Muscat on that account, either under the orders of the Envoy in April 1873, or under the guarantee given to the Sultan in August of that year. The Committee believe that the following state ment of the payments which will have been made on this account by the Indian Government, up to the end of the current financial year is approxi mately correct:— Date and Nature of Payment. Amount in Rupees. Official Bate of Exchange. Amount in Sterling. 1873-74: May 1873.—One year's arrears, payment authorized by Sir B. ITrere (40,000 crowns) - - - - - August 1873.—Balance of arrears from February 1871 to May 1873 (50,000 crowns) - - - Ditto, ditto.—Three months' subsidy February 1874.—Six months' subsidy Rs. 86,000 108,000 21,600 43,200 s, d. 1 11 £ 8,280 10,350 | 6,210 1874-75: Twelve months' subsidy - 86,400 1 10 7,920 1875-76 : Ditto, ditto, ditto - - - - 86,400 1 10| 8,010 1876-77: Ditto, ditto, ditto - - - - 86,400 1 9j 7,830 Es. 518,000 - £48,600 The Committee are of opinion that provision should be made in the Parliamentary Estimates of next year for the payment to the Secretary of State for India in Council of one half of the above sum, or 24,300^., subject to adjustment hereafter upon receipt of detailed statements from India, and that provision should also be made for one half of the subsidy for the year 1877—785 which, at an assumeci rate of exchange of Is. 9d. per rupee, will amount to a sum of 3,780^. 18516. BJ/ 6 As regards the second head of their inquiry,--the Agency and Consulate at Zanzibar,—the Committee find the facts to be as follows. The Agent placed by the Indian Governme^ at Zanzibar was, until 1858, simply a Political officer without Consular functions. In that year he was armed with a Consular Commission, m order to enable him to deal more effectually with slave trade cases. In 1861 it was arranged between Sir U Wood and Lord Russell, respectively Secretaries oi State for India and for Foreign Affairs, that upon certain subjects the Agent and Consul should corre spond with, and receive instructions direct trom, the Foreign Office; and at the present time the bulk of the Agent's correspondence is with that Office. i , The cost of the establishment has always been borne by India. In 1864, Sir C. Wood suggested to Lord Russell that it would be more conducive to the public interests that the Agent should be appointed, paid, and controlled by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but Lord Russell dissented from this view. On the 24th January 1870 a Special Committee appointed to consider questions connected with the East African Slave Trade, composed of represen tatives of the Treasury, Foreign, India, and Colonial Offices, and Admiralty, suggested to Lord Clarendon, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that, as so important a part of the duties of the Agent and Consul at Zanzibar was, at that time, connected with the question of the suppression of the slave trade, it would be an equitable arrangement that the cLirges of the Agency and its dependencies should be equally shared between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. This suggestion was accepted by the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and India, but not by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, who declined to charge the Imperial Ex chequer with any part of the expenses of the Con sulate and Agency at Zanzibar. A correspondence ensued between the several Offices, in the course of which the Secretary of State for India intimated that the refusal of the Treasury to bear a share of the Agency expenses would compel him to take immediate steps, through the Government of India, to place the establishment on an entirely new footing with reference to the requirements of Indian interests and commerce. The change thus fore shadowed would, as was pointed out by Lord Gran ville to the Treasury, have involved the loss by the Foreign Office of all control over slave trade ques tions, and probably their entire neglect. But the views of the Treasury remained unchanged. On the 4th August 1871, a Select Committee of the House of Commons on the East African Slave Trade presented their Report and recommended, amongst other things, that ' as the staff of the ' establishment at Zanzibar would be largely em- ' ployed in the suppression of the slave trade, the &lt;e expense should be equally shared by the Indian * ■ i! ir &lt;1 il • 1' and Imperial Governments' Sbortlv after wards, on the 16th October 1871, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs again requested the Trea sury to reconsider their former decision. No immediate result appears to have followed, nor is any further correspondence on the subject re corded ; but, on the 19th June 1872, the Duke of Argyll, Secretary of State for India, apparently with reference to the appointment of a successor to Mr. Churchill, the retiring Political Agent, tele graphed to the Government of India in the fol lowing terms:—' Imperial Government are to take ' half expense of Zanzibar Agency. Foreign ' Office must therefore be consulted. Delay any ' nomination.' The Committee do not find that any practical step was taken to give effect to the new arrange ment, either at the time, or at the period of Sir Bartle Frere's mission in 1873, when it was recog nized by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as being in force. It was not till the Session of 1875 that provision was made in the estimates presented to Parliament for meeting any part of the cost of the Agency at Zanzibar, and, pending a settlement of the question as to the date from which the arrangement should take effect and the scale on which the establishments should be main tained, the sums voted in that year and 1876 have not been applied. The Committee conceive that the principle of an equal division of the cost o£ the Agency and Con sulate at Zanzibar between the Imperial and Indian Treasuries, for so long as tie establishment is con cerned with slave trade matters, is no longer open to question, and that the main point which they are called upon to consider is as to the date from which the liability of the Imperial Government should be held to commence. The India Office, in the correspondence which has taken place with the Foreign Office, has claimed to be relieved of a moiety of the expenses from the 24th January 1870, the date on which the Departmental Committee reported to Lord Clarendon that ' it would be an equitable arrange- ' ment that the charge of the Zanzibar Agency ' and its dependencies should be equally shared ' between the Indian and Imperial Governments.' But, seeing that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury refused to accede to this recommendation, and persisted in such refusal, the Committee do not think that this view can be insisted upon. They consider, however, that the liability of the Imperial Government may fairly be held to commence from the 19th June 1872, the date of the telegram ad dressed by the Duke of Argyll to the Govern ment of India, which must be assumed to have been sent with the assent of His Grace's colleagues in the Cabinet. The Committee are accordingly of opinion that provision should be made in the Parliamentary 9f8 xnuy nave xootowjj. w ■ — . i • i • establishment alone during the period in question is approximately represented by the following liguies, Viz ' *''' £ 1872-73 - - - 2,600 1873-74 - - 4070 1874-75 - - - 3,442 Interest on the cost of buildings, at the rate of 5 per cent, on 9,000/., would add 450/. a year to the above, and raise the total to 19,662/. Various charges for contingencies have, no doubt, also been incurred. On the other hand, it is understood that the receipts of the Consular Court from fees, penalties, fines, and forfeitures are considerable, and these, by the terms of the Order of the Queen in Council dated 9th August 1866, are applicable to diminish the public expenditure on account of the Consulate. The Committee understand that before the period arrives for presentation of the estimates to Parlia ment, statements are likely to be received from India which may render possible an immediate and final settlement, but should this not be the case, they are of opinion that a sum of 9,000/. may pro perly be voted on account of the amount due to the Indian Government in respect of the Agency ex penses up to the close of the current financial year, subject to readjustment. As regards the future, the Committee have had before them the following estimate furnished by Dr. Kirk:— Proposed Budget Estimate for British Agency and Consulate General at Zanzibar. 1875-76 1876-77 3,650 3,650 17,412 Heads of Expenditure. Salaries. No. 1. Agent and Consul General 2. Assistant-Agent and Vice-Consul 3. Judicial Assistant - 1,980 - 750 - 700 50 - 660 - 132 - 108 - 108 £ House Pent Allowance 4. Agency Surgeon - - _ 5.

Durbar Presents - - - - 100 Total Cost of British Agency - £5,996 The Committee think that the above estimate, with an addition of 450Z. for interest on buildings, raising the total to 6,446^., may properly be sub mitted to Parliament as that of the expenses to be divided between the Imperial and Indian Govern ments. As, however, they understand that the receipts of the Consular Court from fees and penalties amount at present to about 900Z. a year, it is improbable that the net cost of the establish ment will exceed 5,5001., or that a larger sum than 2,750/. will require to be voted from the Imperial Treasury. (Signed) L otjis M allet. H. C. R othery. W. H. Wylde. 8th December 1876. I have signed the above Report in order to ter minate a vexatious correspondence, but I wish to say, that in consenting to recommend to the Secre tary of State in Council to accept the 19th June 1872 as the date from which the liability of the Imperial Government for one half of the expenses of the Zanzibar Agency and Consulate should be held to commence, I must not be taken as in any way abandoning the position which has been main tained by the India Office throughout the corre spondence. On the contrary, I continue of opinion that India has an equitable claim to be relieved of one half of such expenses from the 24th January 1870, when a Committee, composed of represen tatives of all the great Departments of State con cerned, unanimously reported in that sense, their 18516. C£ 10 mnplusion beinff accepted by the two Secretaries ot State, and subsequently affirmed by a PaTilamentary Committee. But, as I have said, in order to avoid further controversy, I am prepared t o r ccMnmen d the Secretary of State in Council to yield the point. (Signed) Louis Mallet. I cannot quite agree with Sir Louis Mallet m thinking ' that India has an equitable claim to be 'relieved of one half of the expenses' of the Zanzibar Agency and Consulate from the 24th of January 1870, when the Departmental Committee reported in that sense. I cannot think that either the Report of a Departmental Committee, or even a subsequent Report of a Parliamentary Committee, can be the foundation for an equitable claim against the Imperial Government. In taking the 19th of June 1872 as the time from which the payment should date, I think that we have gone to the ex treme limit. India had, for her own purposes, established an Agency at Zanzibar; and as the officers at this Agency were employed to perform Imperial duties, India asked us to share the ex penses. It is not from the time when the appli cation was made, nor from the time when a Com mittee, however constituted, recommended that these expenses should be shared between the two Governments, that the payment should commence; but from the time when the Imperial Government undertook the charge. As a matter of fact, we have no direct evidence that the Cabinet, even on the 19th of June 1872, agreed to take its share of these expenses; but we have gone upon the assump tion that the Duke of Argyll would not have sent out such a telegram as he did to India unless there had been some such understanding in the Cabinet, or unless His grace believed at the time that there had been. At all events, the Indian Government acted upon that assumption, and instead of reducing the establishment, as it had threatened to do, con tinued it on the same footing. These are the grounds on which I think the payment can be justified. With respect to the question of the Muscat subsidy, I think that it cannot be regarded apart from the circumstances under which it was first established. It appears to me that, whether the subsidy was originally required to enable Muscat to pay the tribute to the Wahabees, or whether it was the means of preventing the warlike people of Muscat from making war upon Zanzibar, in either case to stop it suddenly would have seriously imperilled the trade of those countries ; and as Sir Bartle Fieie has told us that the whole of the trade from Mozambique to Kurrachee, a distance alono the coast of some 12,000 miles, is entirely in the hands of the Indian traders, so that not a ship can be cleared or a cargo sold without their intervention, I If I | / f I \11 it appears to me that the Indian Government have a very direct interest in the maintenance of peace in those waters. I think, therefore, that the offer of the Imperial Government to pay one half of the subsidy is liberal. These views I have expressed at greater length in a Memorandum, of which I have given a copy to my colleagues. • I cannot conclude these remarks without ad verting to a fact, which has only just come to my knowledge, and which seems to me to have some bearing upon the question for how long a time the payment of the Muscat subsidy should continue. From reports recently received from Zanzibar it appears that the Sultan, notwithstanding (or it might, perhaps, be said owing to) the steps which he hap taken to suppress the slave trade in his dominions, has lately entered into an arrangement with the farmers of the customs, by which he is to receive 30,0002. a year more from them than he has ever before done. Now, although I am not about to contend that it would be proper, in the present state of that country, to insist upon Zanzibar herself paying the subsidy, yet the question must in evitably arise how far it is proper that the British and Indian taxpayers should be called upon to defray a charge which Zanzibar, from her growing resources, appears well able to bear, and from which she has, in fact, never been formally relieved.
