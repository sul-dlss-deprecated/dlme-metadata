                           The Timesand these are also enclosed in the file along with excerpts from Hansard dated December 1878 detailing the compliments paid to Pelly by various members of the British Government over his handling of Indian affairs.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>8th Duke of Argyll George Douglas Campbell</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Lord Colin Campbell</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>10th Earl of Wemyss Francis Richard Charteris</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000395#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000395#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
