Replacement of a Motor Lorry . Reference your Express Letter No. F.83-A/35 dated the 11th April 1935. 2. Provision for the replacement of the Consulate Lorry was omitted by Major Gastrell in the Budget Estimates for the year 1935-36 through an oversight while I was on leave. 3. Owing to unfavourable Rial exchange rate in regard to which I am addressing you separately, it will not be possible to effect any savings from the sanctioned budget grants of the East Persia Consulate General for the current financial year and in the cireunstances there is no likelihood of the expenditure of Rs.5000/- required for the purchase of a new lorry or any portion of this amount being met from the savings within the sanctioned budget grants, especially in view of the fact that I have already been asked to meet the cost and transportation charges of a safe amounting to Rs.l400/- from the savings within the funds at my disposal duringduririg the current financial year. 4. In the circumstances I vould request that the Government of India will be pleased to sanction purchase of the new lorry and allot necessary funds for its purchase.m Copy of an express letter No.360/1/81, dated 15th March 1935, from kks Britconsul, Zabul, to Foreign, New Delhi. Please refer to page 3, para.'C.4.Supplies and Services Maintenance of Lorry', of my Despatch No.l447/A/74 of 24th November 1932 - a copy of which paragraph is attached hereto for ready reference. 2. It has just been brought to my attention that in the Budget Estimates for 1935-36 submitted by Major G-astrell during my absence on leave, provision for the replacement of the Consulate lorry was omitted. 3. The lorry was purchased in April 1930 and has thus been in use for five years. It can probably be kept in a serviceable condition for a further six months. After that, very expensive repairs would become necessary. 4. I therefore beg to request that funds may be allotted for the replacement of the lorry during 1935-36. It is proposed to purchase a Morris two ton six wheeler Chassis with cab, and to construct the remainder of the body locally. This is proposed because, owing to certain local circumstances, the types of body which can be had ready-made for this vehicle are not really suitable. The Morris truck has been found to be far more serviceable under conditions in East Persia, than any other make and as Morris Agents now exist in Persia, spare parts are obtainable locally. 5. The cost of Chassis with cab, landed in Zahidan would be approximately Rs.5,000/- (based on present rate of exchange) and the construction of the body locally is estimated to cost about Rupees 300/-. Against this II estimate that we may be able to sell the present lorry for about Rupees 1,000/-. 6 . If therefore a sum of Rupees 4,000/- can be allotted for the purchase of a lorry including freight charges to Persia, this sum would be sufficient on the understanding that any excess, would be met from the existing annual upkeep grant (from which, if the new lorry be purchased in about six months time, I anticipate some saving can be effected, since upkeep of the new lorry will be below the normal at first) together with the sum received by sale of the existing lorry, e.g. that we should be permitted to sell the present lorry and devote the proceeds plus fresh expenditure to the extent of Rupees 4,000/-, for the purchase of the new lorry, plus freight charges, and cost of constructing a body. Expenditure in excess of the above, if any, to be met from Savings from the current year^ annual grant. 7. It will be noted that the total new expenditure under these proposals will amount to Rupees 4,000/- only, as compared with the sum of Rupees 6,000/- expended in 1930 for the present lorry. 8 . The present lorry will, by the time it is disposed of, have been in use for 5i years, whereas it*s life was originally estimated at 3 years. The new vehicle will be in many respects much stronger and more useful, and with due care should x± last at least six years. 9. Since it is important that the present lorry should not be kept in use so long that it would be impossible to dispose of it, and it is very desirable that it skouldo should be sold before expensive repairs become imperative - which will be the case in about six months time; and moreover, as it will take several months to arrange for the importation of the new lorry, and sale of the existing one* it is requested that I may be informed very early, whether the present proposals are approved by the G-overnment of India and if so, that the necessary funds will be provided, 10 , I am not certain whether the fresh expenditure is divisible with His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain. If such be the case, I would beg to request that the Government of India be pleased to sanction provision of the funds in anticipation of the concurrence of the Home Government. The original expenditure having been sanctioned on the basis of a three years life for the lorry, which will have been kept in service actually for 5 i years, I presume that such concurrence would undoubtedly be forthcoming. As explained above the economical proposals made depend largely on our being able to effect the purchase of the new lorry, within heavy renewal expenses, which I think would be unwise expenditure at this stage of the life of the lorry.• © Copy of page 3, para 'C.4.Supplies and Services Maintenance of Lorry' of letter No.l447/A/74, dated the 24 th No vender 1932, from H.B.M's Consul, Sistan and Kain (and in addition H.i'.M’s Consul Ceneral and Agent of the G-overnment of India in Khorasan) to the Foreign Secretary to the Grovernraent of India in the Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi. In spite of increased necessity for the lorry and inevitable increase in its use, I estimate that with strict supervision the sum already sanctioned can be made to suffice. The lorry has been maintained in a high state of efficiency. It was originally sanctioned 6 n the understanding that it should not be replaced for three years. I am, however, glad to be able to report that I anticipate that it will remain in efficient working order for a period of about five years in all, after which time it may become un economical to run further.Groyerrment of India.

In this connection the Government of India consider that as in the case of Political Officers in Indiana mainte nance grant should be fixed for the up-keep of the furniture now sanctioned for Birjand and Sistan.

As these conditions are not fulfilled in the case of His Ha 4 esty f s Consul, Sistan, the Government of India are unable to support the proposal for the grant to him of a conveyance allowance. 3. As regards the provision of a motor lorry, the Government of India consider that it must be difficult for the Consul in the face of Bolshevik competition to do his duty properly without some such assistance in the matter of transport. They tnerefore recommend that a motor lorry may be provided for the Consulate at an initial cost not exceeding Rupees six thousand (Rs.6,000) and a recurring cost of Rupees two hundred and 1 ifty (Rs.250) per mensem.

In their memorandum No.273-3, dated 11th September 1925 the Government of India informed Major Fisher that they were unwilling to incur so heavy an expenditure on motor cars as that recommended by his predecessor, and the matter was dropped. Most of the conditions described by Mr.Gould, however, continue to exist, while a new factor has lately arisen which renders it even more necessary than in Mr.Gould’s time that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan should be provided with adequate motor transport. I refer to the establishment of a Soviet Consul and Vice Consul in oistan, and of a Vice Consul in Birjand. In this connection I would attention to my telegram No.363, dated 27th December 1927 para.(2) and to my express letter No.28, dated 26th January 1928 para.3(2) in which I emphasized the importance of mobility on the part of Consular officers in East Persia as one of the means whereby the increase in Russian activity and the probable spread of propaganda can best be counteractedi 4 . I would therefore respectfully urge that something, on a smaller scale perhaps than TvTr.G-ould’s proposals, he done to assist the Consul and his staff at this post in the matter of motor transport* 3. The Sistan and Kain Consular district differs from others in Persia, such as Meshed and Kerman, in that it contain no large central tov/n in which most of the work is concentrated* Sistan itself is an oasis dotted with mud villages of which Nasratahad, the headquarters of the local administration and of British Consul, is merely the largest* Such importance as h T asratahad enjoyed before the war as an entrepot of the Indo- Persian trade has disappeared since the arrival of the railway at Duzdap/ aid the deflection of the trade to the direct Duzdap—3irjand—Meshed route, and if the Consul is to keep in touch with the outside world, and in particular with the comparatively heavy commercial and passenger uruj-fic ^/hicn passes through Duzdap, it is essentia-L that he should 'visit the latter place at least four or five times in the year. The summer headquarters of the Sistan Consulate is at Birjand, the capital of the Q,ainat, a sub-province at least as important politically and commercially as Sistan; during the summer it is generally necessary for the Consul to visit Sistan at least once from Birjand, and in the winter Birjand from Sistan. Apart from the above journeys, now that the Sarhad is within the sphere of the Sistan Consulate, both Khwash and Dehaneh-i- Baghi have to be visited occasionally; while it is advisable for the Consul to go at least once a year to Leshed to confer with His Majesty’s Consul General on the numerous questions in which both officers are concerned. The distances invol/ed in the above regular touring are as follows Sistan Duzdap Miles* Duzdap Khwash . * .1^6 Duzdap Dehaneh-i-Baghi* 68 Sistan -Birjand(January-July route via Girdi) 325 Sistan -Birjand(August-December route via Bandan) 234 Birjand Meshed. • 3004. Dak bungalows and hotels being unknown in East Persia, and houses fit for Europeans to live in exceedingly scarce outside the towns, it is necessary for the Consul to take his household about with him, and frequently also tents and camp equipment* For this purpose a 1 - or !■£ - ton lorry is the very least that is required; in point of fact my predecessors and I have usually been obliged, on all except the shortest journeys to use both a touring-car and a lorry. 5. The following is an analysis, based on actual figures for the last three years of the running costs of a touring-car and a lorry travelling 400 miles per month in this district. The estimates will be admitted to err, if anything, on the conservative side, when it is remembered that there is not a single mile of metalled road in all East Persia, and scarcely a bridge. The so-called roads are mere cart-tracks which the Persians have 'repaired’* in places by the simple expedient of strewing them six inches deep with gravel and sharp edged fragments of rock. Not even Irish bridges are used for crossing the many thousand of dry watercourses down which at any moment flood-water may breach the track; while attempts at grading or engineering of any kind are infrequent and primitive. The normal wear and tear on tyres, springs and every part of the car is thus three or four times as severe as on properly metalled and engineered roads, and the consumption of petrol and oil is also considerably higher. Owing again to the non-existence of garages and repair-shops, except at Duzdap and Birjand, it is essential to keep a thoroughly competent (and therefore expensive) driver - mechanic as well as a cleaner, even if one drives one f s own car. 1-ton Lorry .

Against this annual expenditure the Consul draws a total mileage travelling allowance (on 4,800 miles at -/l0/S per mile) of Rs.3,200 per annum, to which may be added perhaps 800 from the travelling allowance drawn by members of his staff who use the cars. Another Rs.800 can generally be spared available from Office Allowance under the head of tour charges. Even so, however the net loss works out at 2,604 a year. 7. It will doubtless be urgeg that a touring-car in addition to a lorry is a luxury for which the Consul should pay for, if he wants it, out of his own pocket. In this connection however I would bring forward the following considerations:- d) The figures given for the maintenance of a touring-car cover regular touring only. If those for local ’‘running about' and pleasure-trips are included the total cost of maintenance will be considerably higher. (2) The principle that Consular officers in East Persia require motors for local use and should be subsidized for the upkeep thereof has been recognised by the Government of India in the case of the Consul General, Meshed, who now draws a conveyance allowance of Rs.100/- for this purpose. (3) All the higher Persian Officials keep touring cars, and it is not consonant with British dignity and prestige that His Majesty f s Consul should travel about in a cheap lorry.

In view of the foregoing, I would recommend (i) That a Kotor lorry costing, say, Rs.6000/- be provided by Government for the Sistan Consulate, and a sum of Rs,250 per mensem granted for its maintenance^ This car will be replaceable by Government after a period of not less than three years, if necessary, (ii) That a conveyance allowance of Rs,75/- per mensem be granted to the Consul, on condition that he actually keeps a private car. As a partial offset to this recurring expenditure, the Travelling Allowance grant of the Sistan Consulate may be reduced by Rs.2,000/- per annum and the Office Allowance by Rs,800/- on account of Tour charges* When travelling on tour with the oft ice lorry, a member of the Consular Staff to whom Supplementary Rule 182 applies will draw travelling allowance according to the provisions of sub section (b) or (a) of that rule according as a separate conveyance (e,g. a touring car) is or is not provided by him at his own expense* A question for consideration is insurance. It is not possible at present to insure cars in East Persia; and while each Consul will of course be personally responsible {apart from accidents) for maintaining the office lorry and handing it over to his successor in good running order, he cannot be expectec to undertake liability for serious damage or total loss resulting from an. accident* As T presume that Government will not be prepared either themselves to insure the car or to undertake an unknown liability for future expenditure, I recommend that, in case of an accident iendeimg the car unfit for further use, it may be written off, and the monthly grant for maintenance utilized as required for the hire of lorries from* In any further communication on this subject, please quote N °- K 1558/1358/234. and address— not to any person by name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State.’' Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. r P 941 ■ _ 5 iL J Foreign Office.

The house was partially furnished with camp chairs and tables, to which were added from time to time odd pieces bought from office allowance savings or inherited from East Persia Cordon Eield Eorce messes. Most of the existing furniture hardly suits a Consular residence, and certain articles, such as chests of drawers, side boards, dining table, floor-cloth, etc., are altogether lacking. It is accordingly proposed that the house should now be furnished at a cost not exceeding Es. 1,700/- (rupees one thousand and seven hundred). 2. The Consul has also reported that no furniture has been provided by Government for the Vice-Consul and Medical Officer, Sistan, 7 /ho is occupying the bungalow' built by the Imperial Bank of Persia for their Accountant. A sufficient quantity of good second hand furniture is reported to be availableavailable in the tov/n and the Consul proposes to purchase certain essential articles for Es* 1,200/- (rupees one thousand and two hundred) for the Vice-Consul^ residence. 3. The Consul, Sistan and ICain, has intimated that he and the Vice-Consul,Birjand, are willing to pay rent at 15 per cent,, the rate fixed by the Government of India for such cases, on the capital cost of the furniture, * excluding that in the two reception rooms, which, under the rules in force ( are furnished free at Government expense in the Consulates in Persia and the Persian Gulf.

Sistan Consulate Hospital. Sir, I am directed to address you on the subject of the maintenance charges of the Sistan Consulate Hospital. 2. The construction of a new hospital for the Consulate at a cost of Rs.4,820/- was sanctioned by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India in his telegram Ho.446, dated the 12th February 1926. His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, now reports that, through the munificence of a local merchant who subscribed Rs.3,000/— for the purpose, a much better operating theatre was built than was originally intended, and a larger quantity of stores and equipment'provided than would otherwise have been possible. The work was completed in October 1926. 3. The annual grant for the maintenance of the Hospital was increased from Rs.650/- to Rs.3,150/- (its present figure), with effect from the 1st April 1913, under the sanction conveyed in Lord Crewe’s Political Despatch Ho.129, dated the 21st November 1913. In 1914 the average monthly number of out-patients treated was 2092, and there were only four beds for in-patients. During 1927-28 the average monthly attendance up to the 8th February 1928 was over 5000, and there is accommodation for 20 in—patients. Allowing, in addition, for an annuel &lt;_ ttendance of 24,500 at the Birjend Vice-Consulate dispensary, which is stocked from the Sistan Consulate Hospital, the present grant alloY/s for an expenditure on medical stores and contingencies ofonly *6 of an anna per patient. This means that scarcely any preventive or curetive sera or vaccines, and none of the more expensive special drugs, can he supplied, and the usefulness of the hospital is thus strictly limited. In view of the political importance of the medical work and the probability of serious ■competition with a Russian Consulate Hospital at no distant date the Consul for Sistan and Kain has recommended an increase of Rs.1,850/- in the Office Allowance Grant of this Consulate for Medical Stores and contingencies. This would allow of an expenditure of 1 anna per head on 80,000 patients at sistan a^nd Birjand together, and would also enable the Medical Officer to extend his activities and the influence of the Consulate by occasional tours among the villagers of Sis tan and tyainat. ouch tours are at present impracticable for lack of drugs and camp medical equipment.

From His Britannic ..ajesty's Consul for Jistan and Kain, To The Secretary to the Government of India' in the Foreign and Political Dapartment, Simla. I have the honour to submit a report on the Hospital quarters in the Sistan Consulate. The buildings are a conglomeration of mud built godov/ns without windows or pucca floors which served the purpose of a dispensary and wards when the Consulate was first built, and before a medical ofiicer was appointed. The Sanitary deficiencies and inadequacy of these quarters were brought to notice twantyone years ago, in 1904, He improvements have been made since beyond the addition of a verandah, and the construction of an operating room of a. temporary nature, which has been abandoned as unsafe since the rain of last December. In 1905 proposals were submitted to the Government of India for building a^ new hospital at a total cost of Hs.ll,50o, which was to include the purchase of a sits outside the Consulate. This was not accepted on financial grounds. In 1908 fresh proposals were submitted as a site was available without'extra expenditure in the Consulate area whichn • 2^1 fiiq; ai'd ci Ib^cC l J ox£ix;BJi-i u aiH t x 3. . ; )1IB £ 'X Bfi j-^nT 1 j ifl*.. r icvoE edJ o. ^eJaiDiig sd'V ei-uc , ineai-jRjefi iaoiiiioi one asieiot «fj ai • eJ-IwiroC r,-.isrL eriJ nr f.'wri--fjp j ‘ ■ - 1 - 'A »- -I al .■-•• 3 fi a-i:- •• e:TOvjrTfc eoiJort ©} scQSjcid msw • '16CIP.!f»05?v. 10 ill ;-ri eiij IC C^co i ijo: r; j I■ • jicreoxi we.rt jiubln/cr io'i -iba': -U. b lo espr:oiirq oLjjiOni ui g^v .ioiiv; t i.£; .fj*IjjE'foO s/ij eibisj/jo ■nil no jeJqeooB Xorr s^w siiiT £''•• e : is a sp ; eJ j i£io r jjs fie. r ' *Ipgo€[0^q ifreii .j 4)9X fi T i: T’ eisLaeupO eri ni riurJifeaeq**, si#*.

I now have the honour to request that xresh consideration may be given to the question of building a new hospital on the following grounds. 1. The existing buildings which were considered insanitary and inadequate in 1904, were built in a kacha manner, and have now fallen into so unsatisfactory a condition that I think it would be most unwise to attempt to put them into repair. Tajor Dickson, the Vice Consul and Medical Officer, has informed me that he is unable to perform operations except of an urgent nature in the theatre, which is no longer safe, and that the accomodation for inpatients, especially surgical cases, which was reported to oe unsuitaole in 1908 is far worse than anything he has ever seen as a Civil jurgeon in India, even in a village local dispensary The average daily attendance in 1924 was 118 outdoor, and five indoor patients. 175 operations were performed. 2. The present buildings were adapted for hospital use before the appointment of a British Medical Officer to this Consulate, and at a time when medical work was also carried out at the Russian Consulate, to which a European Doctor was attached, and in our own camp hospital at Kuhak The work that used to be done by these institutions, and latqr by an American Medical mission hospit-1 which has also gone, now falls entirely on ^he consulate dispe.. s.aw, whichwhich, Major Dickson, says is not in a condition to cope with it. iince the rail my has increased the trade wit:, India twenty fold, a large Indian colony has settled in iistan which may he expected to grow considerably when the economic developments now decided on by -he American financial mission are carried out. Prom a political point of view consideration may be given to the fact that the hospital is attended by a large numoer of natients from Persian Jistan as wall as from the Paran, Ohakansur and Rudbar districts of Afghanistan. Major Dickson has told me that he is not able to perform any except emergent operations under existing conditions, and the result of having to refuse to accept patients, who may have come from considerable distances for treatment at a British hospital cannot be anything out extierneit harmful to our prestige. 3 . for the abov- 6 . re- sons it will be seen that we must either practically rebuild the existing builcings on their present site or construct completely new quarters elsewhere Of the two alternatives there can be really no question that it would be far preferable and more economical to build fresh quarters on ground available for the purpose. This was advocated in 19C5 and 190D and the reasons applicable then are far more cogent now. 4 . I accordingly have the honour to submit rough plans for the proposed buildings with the request that in view of the urgency of the work, early orders may kindly be issued sanctioning the proposal.
