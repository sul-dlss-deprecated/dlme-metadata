They are followed by file notes (folios 103-115), which include a dispersed and mainly chronological list of documents in the file (folios 107, 110, 112-114 and lastly 103). The list records both their full document reference number and a simple running number from one of two sequences: S.No. 1 to S.No.17, followed by 1 to 25. These numbers in the list help to identify and locate the documents in the file.</extent><extent>The main foliation sequence commences at the front cover and terminates at the back cover. These numbers are written in pencil and are predominantly found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. A second incomplete foliation sequence runs between ff 45-84. These numbers are also written in pencil, have been crossed out and can be found in the same position as the main sequence. A third, very short numbering sequence runs through the index pages at the back of the file between ff 103-107. These numbers are also written in pencil and can be found in the same position as the main sequence. Circled index numbers written in ink and coloured crayon can also be found throughout the file. Foliation errors: 1A and 1B; 5A and 5B.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains mainly Government of India circular letters and memoranda issued mainly by the Finance Department, Foreign and Political Department and the Office of the Accountant-General, Central Revenues, New Delhi.
