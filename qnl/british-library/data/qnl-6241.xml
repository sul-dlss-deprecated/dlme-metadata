No. c/195. The 12th February, 1948. I enclose a copy of the original Sharjah Air .Agreement and also of Residency Memorandum No.1285-3 dated the 4th July, 1947, and its enclosures, which you saw when you acted as Political Agent, Bahrain. I also enclose a table which I have made out showing the different kinds of payments, and a modification^ and proposals for the future regarding them. 2. Jassim will remember that Ranee visited Sharjah in January, 1947, and after tha^Galloway fwho aofro4 £as Political Agent) reported to the Political Resident that, as regards the air agreement, the Shaikh of Sharjah’s requests concern (i) increase of his personal subsidy; (ii) in the rent of the Rest House; and (iii) rent for the buildings in the addi tional area on the map signed by the Shaikh, received with your memorandum No.781-6/3(B) dated the 11th May, 1944, and forwarded herewith in original ( return reques ted ). Galloway recommended that the Shaikh’s personal subsidy should be increased to Rs.1,000/- per month, that no increase should be made in the rent of the Rest House, and that a ground rent should be paid to him since the date of the termination of the war with Japan for the 'additional area”. In further correspondence with the /Political G.N* Jackson, Ssq., M.B.E., Political Officer, Trucial Coast, S har jah.tmmm Political Resident he emphasized that before opening negotiations for a new Civil Air agreement, we should clear up with the Shaikh of Sharjah the points (just mentioned) outstanding under the current one. The political Resident, in addressing the India Office, asked that he should be authorised to inform the Shaikh that he will be paid ground rent for the 'R.A.K. Camp' (i.e., the 'additional area') with effect from the date of cessation of hostilities with Japan, and stated that he would then make recommendations regarding the amount of rent which should be offered to the Shaikh. He had asked that he should be informed of the future require ments of the R.A.F. and the B.O.A.C. at Sharjah to enable us to consider what form the future air agreement should take, and what payments should be offered to the Shaikh besides the ground rent. Re did not mention Galloway’s proposal for an increase in the Shaikh’s personal subsidy. The Secretary of State for India's Express Letter No. Ext. 1359/47,dated the 26th June, 1947, is a reply to the political Resident's reference. 3. First of all, I should be glad of any comments you may have to make on the civil and R.A.F. requirements as stated in the Secretary of State's Express Letter. Then I should be glad to know if you agree with me that the payments listed in the column 'Under consideration 1 for future' in my statement, are those v/hich we ought to offer the Shaikh for a new air agreement. Those for the guards and the Air Station rent will remain unchanged; I have no record that the Shaikh asked that they should be increased I am agreeing with Galloway that it is not to our interest 6 /to5 -3- to raise the rent for the Rest Rouse, nor have I con sidered raising the landing fee. I am agreeing with Galloway also in accepting the figure of Rs.1,000/- as the future personal subsidy, and with Ranee for quoting Rs.500/- as the proposed rent for the additional area. The arrears of this should, of course, be paid in a lump sum. 4. I should also like your ideas as to the form of the future air agreement, and should be grateful for a draft if you can manage it. 5. A letter from Harrison suggests that as B.O.^.C.'s future requirements are rather vague it would perhaps be preferable, in order to avoid the accusation that we are establishing an R.A. ip, base at Sharjah, for the facilities required by the R.A.F. (and the B.O.A.C. at present) to be covered by an agreement with 'His Majesty's Government or their agents'. This you might bear in mind. 6. I have not checked the list of the R.A.F. require ments given as an enclosure to the Secretary of State for India’s Express Letter with the plan which I am sending you. Perhaps you could do so and even have an up-to-date map showing these requirements made. 7. You should not, of course, yet inform the Shaikh that he will be paid ground rent, for the R.A.F. camp.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, &lt;T) Bri tish Agency &gt; Department. Shar jah .

The Command Auditor, who is here now, confirms that during the war when Sharjah was a regular h.A.F. Station the Officer Commanding was authorized to settle such matters on his own initiative without reference to Air Headquarters. The 38 guards to which you refer in paragraph 3 of your express letter ko. 141 are these guards. They have always been paid by the R.A.F. and they are quite separate from the 37 guards paid for through this office under the terms of the 1932 Air Agreement. 4. The misunderstanding about the guards has arisen because the Officer Commanding of the i.A.F* here, who has a copy of the Air Agreement of 1932, took it upon himself — without fully understanding the position and without consulting this office — to inform Air Headquarters that the R.A.F. here are paying the guards that are already being paid for through this office. marked 46 men to provide a nightly guard of 38 men at the R.A.F. Camp and 18 nen to provide a standing guard of 2 men at the B.O.A.C. Rest House. It appears to me that the pay of 37 guards agreed to in 1932 was in the nature of a payment for police protection. B.O.A.C. here are not so much concerned that the full 37 should constantly be employed as that secu ity should be good. Indeed, the pjzysical presence of so many guards would be an embarrassment to B.O.A.C. xhe Officer Commanding, R.A.F., however, insistson the physical presence at night of all the 38 guards employed by the R.a.F.

Ruler of Sharjah.Translation of letter No* 185 dated the 9th Rabi al Thani 1368 (8-2-49) from Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, to Mr* P.D* Stobart, the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah* After Compliments. I have gone through the draft agreement which is to be renewed now concerning the Civil Air Station and found it to be unacceptable and liable to great modification. The first agreement is preferable to this from various aspects taking into consideration the circumstances under which it was concluded. I, therefore, request you to give favourable consideration to my coments :- (1) The first agreement was coneluded at a time when cost of living and other essential requirements were low and before the world developments and changes* Now as conditions have actively changed from what they were before, it is necessary to give consideration to these changes. (2) Also during the time agreement was conoluded buildings were not erected and the area was not delineated. Colonel Biscoe used to describe the matter to me as very simple; but it appeared to me very clearly to be the opposite* I, however, observed my obligations to the High British not Government as it has/been my habit to act otherwisa I as well as my ancestors have always preferred all along to observe and respect agreements and obligations entered into between us and the High British Government even if such agreements and obligations are prejudicial to our interests* We believe that the High British Governments aim is to administer right justice and equity* (3) The rent fixed for the rest house i.e., the previous place in which the passengers are accommodated which is Ks. 300/- is so small that it . ./even2 even does not represent the rent of an ordinary house in the town. The reason why I accepted Rs. 300 /- in the first agreement is because the British Government took upon themselves payment of building and other expenditure without charging interests for the money. They also supplied on my behalf all the iron windows etc. In this agreement, however, there is nothing of this sort and therefore this must be taken into account and given due consideration. (4) There is a further remark, i.e,, no rent has been mentioned for the additional building added to the rest house in the agreement. (5) The abovementioned remarks is very important and I request you to give it due attention. (6) I cannot agree to the pay for the guards as it is small. During the time the first agreement was concluded a labourer used to get from As. -/8/- to He. 1/- p.d. but now wages of labourers habe gone up and a labourer now gets from the companies in (^atar, Kuwait etc., not less than Rs. 10/- p.d. When the Company start work on this side a labourer will demand more than this. This concerns an ordinary labourer who works for a limited time. People left here in search of work. A guard who carries out his duties and shoulders responsibilties by day and night should be given sufficient wages and this is to be decided in the light of this difference. (7) The personal subsidy is very small. In the past I contented myself with it as the State had a large income out of pearl trade, diving and customs. Attention should, however, be paid to the fact that the principal pearl trade has fallen down, income from customs ... /decree csddecreased and expenses increased due to the present developments. (8) Also the hire of (R.A.F.) Camp the area of which has been extended from time to time is negligible. (9) The rent of &amp;. 500/- which you contemplate fixing for all the present R.A.F. buildings which occupy a large plot of land as pointed out to you in my previous letters, you are fully aware that this rent is not. even sufficient for one building out of those numerous buildings and constructions. (10) The fee in respect of the landing of aircraft should be increased to a reasonably fair figure. I request you to send me a reply to what I mentioned.

Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr, to receive salaries, allowances and rents according to what Mr. G.N. Jackson decided in the agreement and to its continuation letter dated the 8th Rabia al awval 1368 (/-2-49) Oi ich you agreed, that finally ana will effect from that date. Usual Ending. /s wm J ‘ The Persian Gulf nesidency, Bahrain. 17th December, 1949. Dear General Department, In Foreign Office despatch ho. 63 (W1394/15/ 802) of the 3rd August we received instructions on the last of the points which we had referred to you about the new Civil Air Agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah and the hope was expressed that it might now be possible to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. Unfortunately the Shaikh of Sharjah is in hospital in Bombay and there is no prospect of his early return. We nave asked him to authorise his brother Shaikh muhammad, who is acting for him, to sign the Agreement on his behalf, but so far all he has done is to tell his brother that he may draw the additional pay for the guards provided for in the draft agreement. It may be some months before we make any further progress. The Shaikh was given notice of the renewal of the existing Agreement on the 19th April, 1948, and he replied accepting this notice, vide tne translation forwarded with this residency complimentary slip ho.47(81/87) of the 7th May, 1948, and it may therefore be regarded as still being in force indefinitely. We are sending a copy of this letter to the Civil air Attache at Baghdad and the Bahrain Political Agency. Yours ever, Besidency. The General Department, The Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.Confidential: D.O.Ho, 15-0436 British Agency 9 Sharjah# 5th January 1950. Dear Felly, Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr has now agreed to let hie brother sign the Sharjah Air Agreement. 2. I should be grateful for urgent instructions as to the terms finally agreed upon by K*M.G.» as I am particularly anxious to deal with Shaikh Itohanoad who is more reasonable than the Ruler. 3. I suggest that although the old agreement is still in force indefinitely until the signing of a new one# we agree to pay the new rates for guards retrospectively to the time the old agreement really expired. The delay in signing is, after all largely due to Shaikh Sultan f s illness and not entirely to reluctarce on his part. Yours sincerely, m C.J. Felly, ^squire, O.jj.it., Political Agent, Strain.itco Confidential. Political Agency, No.C/TC-8. Bahrain, 14th January, 1950. u«s There has been so much going on here recently that I have not found time as I would have wished pro perly to reply to your D.O.No. 15-0436 of 5th January. I am sending you herewith my file on the Sharjah Air Agreement which I think will give you all the information you require and enable you to draft a final agreement for the Shaikh to sign. I think I myself have got to sign, so perhaps it would be better to have two original copies, one for the Shaikh and one for this office, both to be signed by both of us. (Copies for the Foreign Office and the Political Resident with our names typed thereon would of course be required in addition.) 3. Your point about the retrospective payment for the guards could be taken up *fter the signing of the agreement. 2. In order not to hold up the matter any longer P.D.
