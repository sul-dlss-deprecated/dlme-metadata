On the forehead is a small rim or edging frequently found on these objects and presumably intended to contain an inlay. The workmanship is very good and the piece is quite spirited. \r\nCondition: The object now has a beautiful red and green patina. There are numerous spots of light green suggesting the color of the old incrustation. There is a large gap on the front of the base of the neck. Otherwise the object is in perfect condition.", "medium": "Bronze", "dimensions": "3 3/4 x 3 5/16 x 2 1/2 in.
