A copy of our letter together with a copy of the Company’s letter was sent to Mr. Pyrnan. As you will see, the Company confirmed that if they too&lt;c-over the hancilin of all the external telegraph communications in Kuwait they *ould n t wish to operate the Kuwait-Baera land-line (which is in a bad condition and requires renewal), and asked that it be abandoned. The Company pointed out that the relative traffic couiu . bc^ uis &gt;oseu . of by their direct wireless circuit to Bahrain and thence fy cable to Fao. They also mentioned that during emergencies it had been suggested that a direct wireless circuit could be v worked between Kuwait and Basra, but up to that time th'e Iraqi Authorities had not considered the volume of traffic justified the circuit. In order to avoid too great an increase to the costs of the present users of the landline, the rate for which is 6 annas per word, the Company indicated that they were prepared 1 to reduce the rate via wireless, whether via Bahrain or via/ G.D. Spinney Esq.., Foreign Office.or via the proposed direct emergency circuit, from 12 annas to annas per word, to be shared on the basis of 2 annas for the company and ? annas for the Ira^i \ AdiOinistration. idr.Harrison replied on the 21 st iviay (ref.Pol, (Ext) 1674/48) to the effect that it was thou ht 'desirable to obtain the agreement both of the Pakistan arid Iraqi Governments to the proposed abandonment of . the landline and with a view to the foreign Office talcing the necessary action he sent a copy of his Letter to Major Stewart, who we understand passed it to you. The Company have now informed us that they would prefer to operate a direct Kuwait-Besra wireless circuit with the Iraqi Administration rather than handle the relative traffic via Bahrain. e should be glad, therefore, if when seeding the agreement of the Iraqi 'roveminent to the abaridonriient of the 1 * 3 nciline and to the. j proposed rate of 9 annas for the wireless routes the foreign Office will emphasise the Company’s preference for a^direct wireless circuit as an alternative to the .landline.

After the closure of the landline the telegraph business of the Kuwait Oil Company with Iraq would be transferred to Cable and Wireless Limited and a deposit for this traffic (such as is now held by the sub-postmaster) would be unnecessary.

Deal* Harrison, I should be glad if you would consider the matter raised in the enclosed copy of an official letter we have received from the Foreign Office (their reference XF027(3/48) of the 12th February) in the light of paragraph 4 of Miss Shaw’s letter to me of the oth February of which you already have a copy. Miss Shaw said the Treasury have no oojection to the Political Resident providing fiinds for the operation of the postal services in the Persian Gulf on the authority of the Conmonwealth Relations Office, but would be glad to have particulars regarding control and accounting. We are ready to supply such particulars, but before doing so should be glad to know with which Department the Political Resident accounts. You will no doubt appreciate that it may be necessary for the Postal Superintendent to provide at very short notice/large sums for which he would not be in a position to budget in advance. In our view it would be necessary for him to be in a position to obtain these sums on the spot rather than to have to await drafts from the General Post Office in London. I should therefore be gLad to know whether the Commonwealth Relations Office is able and willing to advance the necessary sums through the Political Resident. If not I am afraid we shall have to ask the Ebreign Office to reconsider their decision. I should add that the sterling equivalent of the sums advanced would be repaid to the lending Department in London by the Post Office at short intervals as is done in the case of similar advances to the Postmaster of Tangier which are a Ebreign Office matter. We are assuming that you have passed on to the Political Resident the Treasury decisions on other points referred to in /Miss F.A.K.

In these circumstances it will be necessary for the Post Office to furnish the Political Resident with sufficient local currency to enable him to meet expenditure chargeable to the Post Office Vote and it is presumed that arrangements will be made accordingly.

Contract*, other than B.I.S.N. contract: The C.O.D. services from the United Kingdom to India, Pakistan and the Persian Gulf have been suspended for some time past at the request of tbi Indian and Pakistan administrations. The number ij of C.C.D. parcels exchanged between India/pakistaij and the Gulf is very small and it is possible thal v/hen control of the Gulf agencies passes to the ^ British administration the Indian and Pakistan postal authorities may desire the suspension of the C.C.D. facilities. In any event, if the C.O.D. services between the Gulf and India/Pakista were maintained they would have to be reconstituted on the lines of the normal inter- natiun-tj. C.O.D. service. In all the circumstance it would oe preferable that, at the outset-■atT'any rate and until some experience of the new conditions is gained, all C.O.D. services to and from the Gulf should be suspended. ui thu assumption that the In lian/pakistan sea and lane, costs would not exceed those estimated in the report, it is not proposed to introduce a special rate for parcels from the Gulf to India and Pakistan but to maintain the existing rate of 6 annas per lb. There would thus be no change in the existing postage rates for any parcels postec in the Gulf. It is proposed that the limits of weight, size etc. of the various types of postal packets which apply in the United Kingdom should be observed in the Gulf. It is proposed to adopt the x^olitical Resident’s recommendation to discontinue the contract with the Kuwait Zubair Transport Co. /(vi) Sea costs.(vi) Sea costs Reference is invited to the relative sentences of the 'Observations' column on pages 2^7 that soa costs have been estimated at l-J annas per lb.

The recommendation of a rate of 3^ annas per ^ ounce to Pakistan for correspondence not requiring air conveyance beyond Karachi has however been met by the introduction of a rate of 3j annas for all Western Pakistan including air conveyance within Pakistan if available. The rate to India and Eastern Pakistan has been fixed at 6 annas per ■§- ounce. Money orders between Agencies and India and/or Pakistan It is proposed to use India/pakistan pattern money orders and to amend existing stock in manuscript as regards heading and reference to Indian Administration, rules and charges. New forms will be headed 'British Post Office Agencies, Persian Gulf'. As accounting for the existing Money Order service between this country and India/pakistan is conducted through Bombay at the request of the Pakistan administration, it is proposed that, for the present, the statements of paid orders of India/pakistan issue which are prepared at Bahrain should be sent to Bombay. Money Orders (Telegraph) Money Orders The •ervice to be provided will follow the (Telegraph) lines of the ordinary Money Order service.

If the Indian and Pakistan administrations agree to the recommendations, they will no doubt issue the necessary notice to the public in the Persian Gulf well before the 1st of April. The British administration will deal with the allotment of call signs after the 1st of April, The question of the transfer of Guadur is under active consideration. aio* Ihese matters are/under consideration. The postal Superintendent, Mr.H.C. Breach, who is already in the Gulf, is examining the conditions with the object of taking over the offices on the 1st of April. No communication regarding Mr. Appleby's recommendations has yet been received from the Pakistan Government.The Overseas Mails Branch, Persian Gulf Postal, eto» Services. As instructed, I journeyed by air from the United Kingdom to Karachi on the 19 th of October for preliminary discussions with the Pakistan postal authorities on the question of the arrangements necessary in connexion with the transfer of the Persian Gulf postal, etc. services to H.M. Government. The preliminary talks over, I proceeded to Bahrain, accompanied by an officer of the Pakistan Post and Telegraph Department, for further discussions with Sir Rupert Hay, the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf, and then proceeded in turn to Kuwait, IJubai and Muscat for inspection of the Pest Offices at those places. I then returned to Karachi for final discussions with the Pakistan authorities. Daring my visits to all these places, I also had many talks with the Political Agents for the territories concerned, with Cable and Wireless representatives, and with others directly interested in the question of the taking over by the British Post Office of the postal, etc. services in the Gulf. In addition, I visited the Shaikh of Bahrain, and was visited by the Secretary to the Shaikh of Kuwait. On the basis of these discussions and inspections the following recommendations and remarks are made, I u will be seen that it is proposed to maintain the present services so far as practicable, but, as will be appreciated, it will be necessary to alter the existing postage rates or charges in many instances, as well as the conditions applicable to particular services, so as to fit in with the machinery of the British post Office., One of the most important features will be the change-over from 'inland' 1 to 'foreign' rates and conditions in regard to postal matter posted in the Persian Gulf Agencies addressed to India and Pakistan, inasmuch as anything going overseas from the Gulf, even to India and Pakistan, will have to be treated as Imperial and Foreign matter under the British Post Office Act and the Postal Union Convention.

The handling costs in the Agencies are very small under present conditions and the sea costs, although not definitely fixed, will probably be in the neighbourhood of 1- 1 7 annas per lb. The present rate of 6 annas per lb. should • therefore adequately cover the costs, and it seems unnecessary to make any change.

If compensation in excess of amount mentioned is desired, recourse must be had to separate insurance system. It is proposed to bring the system into line with the practice in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, under existing (Indian) regulations, registration i.^ obligatory for all parcels exceeding 440 tolas in weight and for all parcels requiring Customs Declarations, i.e. parcels sent from one Agency to another.

In that event, the existing postage rates from India and the Persian Gulf, which have been recently increased, should adequately cover the costs. Parcels frcrrt the Gulf for other countries are not numerous, and as the handling charges in the Gulf are negligible it is recommended that existing rates on these parcels also should be maintained, i.e. the British Post Office to bear any small loss that mi gilt arise due to the cost of sea transport from the Gulf ports to Karachi, Bombay, or Basra by B.I.S.B. vessels. The proposed rates for India and Pakistan have been based on (a) hand ling costs in Persian Gulf (b) sea costs and (c) territorial credits due to India or Pakistan. The costs of (c) are 8a., 8a., 1 rux^ee, 1 rupee 8a., and 2 rupees 4a« respectively for 2, 3, 7, 11, and 22 lb, parcels, and the costs of (a) have been fixed provision ally at the same amounts, although in (fact actually much less under present conditions.

Any transit credits that may be due to India for parcels transiting that Dominion for Pakistan or due to Pakistan for parcels transiting that Dominion for India, have been ignored for the purpose of assessment of postage rates ‘ the British Post Office could bear the small loss, if any, arising in respect of such parcels. The number of parcels posted in the Gulf for India or Pakistan is less than $0 a month. F.D.D. service No service No demand Imperial and \ International Reply Coupons Paid only in Persian Gulf and not issued. Additional notes on mail services. (i) Limits of weight and size of postal packets. The existing limits of weight and size of certain categories of post J. packets vary in some instances from those applicable to similar categories of postal packets in the services from the United Kingdom, and whilst it is desirable that the United Kingdom limits should be adopted as soon as possible, too much stress should not perhaps be placed on this aspect at the outset, since too many changes at the same time will only serve to confuse the native postal officials. The changes could be brought in gradually. (ii) Mail contracts . B.I.S.N. Contract . The Indian P. &amp; T. Dept, have agreed to continue to pa}' for it, and whatever mails are carried by B.I.S.N, steamers, or other vessels under contract with India, will have to be paid for at Postal Union Convention rates. Other contracts . Two other contracts appear to have been made. One for the conveyance of air mails between the Post Office at Bahrain and the airport at a payment of 400 rupees a month to a local contractor. The other, also 400 rupees a month, for the carriage of mails between Kuwait and Zubair (Iraq) by the Kuwait Zubair Transport Co. The latter service is used in preference to the slow steamship service between Kuwait and Basra, mainly for8. 4^ f or the carriage of air nail correspondence; and a copy of the re?, tive ; contract is attached. The political Agent, Kuwait, has hitherto drawn App* A. up this contract on behalf of the Indian p. &amp; T. Dept., and is prepared ^ to continue to do so, if desired, for His .Majesty* s Government, payment for both these services is made by the local Post Offices, and this arrangement should not perhaps be disturbed. As regards, however, the Kuwait-Zubair land service, as the O.M.B- is aware, it has been suggested by the Political Resident that this service should be discontinued, air mails being sent instead by the Iraqi Airways thrice weekly air service between Kuwait and Basra, and the surface malls oy ship; and this suggestion is supported. The O.M.B, are no doubr already giving consideration to the air nail aspect. (iii) Communications . Communication with the Gulf ports has been for some time past, and is still, poor. B.I.S.N. steamers leave Bombay for Basra each week (one a fast service and the other a slow service), but whi?e both fast and slow services call invariably at Bahrain and Kuwait, calls at other ports are very irregular. There is no fixed schedule and calls are dependent on whether or not there is any cargo and the tides, It may happen that no call is made at Dubai and Muscat for instance for as long as 2 months. The B.I.S.N. Company hope tc make an impro* r emer in the situation, but the position should be watched, and if necessary the Indian postal authorities might be asked to press the Steamship Company to make regular calls at all the ports, at least .by the slow steamers. : . (iv) Delivery of mail . Letters are delivered immediately after arrival at the Peso Office, whatever the hour. As a general rule, however, the inhabitants who are aware that a ship is duo, call personally for -cheir mail at the Post Offices where delivery is effected. The position in regard to parcels varies at the different pest Offices and is as fallows:- BAHRAIN . When a parcel is received at the post Office, the addressee is handed a certificate of delivery (specimen aiincxed) which he has to take to + App* B. the Customs Office. The Customs authorities stamp this certificate, and (not cox^ied) the addressee returns with it to the Post Office which then hands the parcel over. The addressee then has to go to the Customs with the parcel for examination of contents and to pay Customs charges, if any. The charges are collected by the Customs and the Post Office is not drawn into the transaction. A copy of the Parcel Bill relative to each, mail is handed by the Post Office to the Customs Office for information. KUWAIT . After the inward parcel bags have been opened in the post Office, delivery receipts are sent to the addressees, and the -parcels are handed to thethe Customs authorities, together with a copy of the relative parcel Bill-. (The Customs actually call for the parcels at tho Post Office.) The addressee signs the receipt, and returns same, to Post Office which hands him a manuscript note addressed to the Customs asking that .ti iG parcel may be delivered. The addressee then collects the parcel from the Customs, paying any necessary duty. MUSCAT . Parcels from India/Pakistan . The Customs Officer calls at Post Office, examines parcels and assesses charges, if any. Post Office sends addressee a delivery receipt, who signs it and calls at Post Office to take delivery on 'payment of any charges which are handed over immediately to Customs. Parcels from- other places . Same procedure as in case of Bahrain . DUBAI . Copy of relative Parcel Bill handed to Customs authorities. Parcels are delivered by post Office to addressees against signature on delivery receipt. Post Office sends a notification in manuscript to Customs (through intermediary of addressee) that delivery has.been effected, and it is up to the addressee to settle Customs charges, if any, direct with Customs authorities. The number of letters and parcels posted for local delivery is negligible at any of the Agencies. (v) Handling costs of parcels in Persian Gulf ports . Under present conditions the costs are small All mails are conveyed from the ships direct to the Post Offices, or are collected from Hie Post Offices for conveyance to the shixis, by B.I.S.N. agents. Such delivery and collection is covered by the B.I.S.N. contract. The B.I.S.N. agents even arrange without payment for the delivery to the Post Offices at Bahrain and Kuwait of mail from the United Kingdom by Strick Line vessels, although whether they will oontinue to do this when the British Post Office takes over is problematical. If they do not, and there is no reason why they should do so without 'payment, the costs for conveyance and delivery to the Post Of!ice will be fairly high, since in the case of B . .rain the Strick Line vessels anchor about 3 miles off Sitra (south east of Balirain island) and the mails have to be conveyed by launch to the- island and thence by road (seme 14 miles) to the Post Office at Manama. Discreet enquiry revealed that the Agents would probably require about 3 rupees per bag for such conveyance. In the circumstances, it is suggested that at the outset no change should be made in regard to the existing terminal credits required under Indian regulations, vizt., 8 a.,8 a., 1 rupee, i rupee 8 a. and 2 rupees 4 a. respectively for 2, 3, 7&gt; 11 and 22 lb, parcels. The matter might, however, be reconsidered later, say after 6 months 1 working, in the light of the conditions then prevailing.10. (,vi) Sea Costs . The Pakistan authorities have conmunicated with the Indian postal authorities regarding the credits they will require for the carriage of mail by B.I.S.N. steamers in the Gulf, and are awaiting a reply. (vii) Composition and circulation of mils . The Persian Gulf Offices will require definite instructions on this point. They have no such instructions at present, and are working from memory on instructions laid down in the dim past. Much of what they are now doing is incorrect, both as regards surface and air mails. (viii) Import and Export regulations, etc . A statement*giving this information for each of the Offices App* 0. concerned is attached. (ix) Compensation for ordinary parcels . Hitherto, no compensation has been paid for ordinary uninsured parcels posted in the Gulf, due to the fact that registration of parcels generally is obligatory. The United Kingdom procedure should now be introduced. Compensation up to the equivalent of £3 being paid for an inland parcel, and up to £1 or £1 12s. (as the case may be according to weight) for an imperial or foreign parcel. (x) Notification of change-over in control to administrations of Postal Union . Such notification, including changes in services, alterations in postage rates, etc., will presumably be done through the medium of the International Bureau at Berne by both the British and India/Pakistan administrations. , . (xi) Parcel rates from India and Persian Gulf . The rates as shown in the October, 19A&amp; edition of the Indian Post Office Guide have been recently increased in many instancy, and particulars of the revised rates are shown on the schedule annexed. AIR MAIL SERVICES The main effect of the change of control will be that communication with India and Pakistan will be international instead of internal. This means that the existing air mail rates from the Persian Gulf to India and Pakistan will have to be increased. An economic rate covering the whole of India/Pakistan, and the use of Indian/Pakistan air services, would be about 6 annas per half-ounce (this is inclusive of, and not additional to, ordinary postage). It might however be practicable to offer a separate air postage rate, say, 3i annas per half-ounce, for letters addressed to Pakistan not requiring internal air transmission v/ithin Pakistan, e.g., for letters addressed to Karachi; and the Pakistan authorities would like this to be arranged if possible. The air postage rates to other countries will be affected by reason of the fact that the Gulf ports are in a different financial zone3 11. zone from India for the purpose of air conveyance charges, and it seems likely that .the air postage rates to countries v/estv;ar can be reduced, while the rates for countries eastwards may have to be increased. For example, an air postage rate of 6 annas per half-ounce could perhaps be justified for letters addressed to the United Kingdom (as compared with the existing rate of '12 annas per half-ounce). Air Mail rates for the Western hemisphere generally might be at slightly less rates than those existing at present: possibly the sum of the rates from the Agencies to the United Kingdom find from the United Kingdom to destination. ■ An air letter ferm at 6 annas might be allowed to any country, including the Western hemisphere. Reports on this subject Have already been sent to Headquarters, and the Political Resident of the Persian Gull 1 and the D. G. of P. &amp; T., Karachi, have been advised that the whole question of the air postage rates is under consideration by the British Post Office and that full details will be forwarded to them as soon as a decision has been reached. / I enclose a copy of a report which I handed on the 14th of November to App. E. the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf on the question of the use of the Iraqi air service between Kuwait and Basra for the conveyance of air mail. Inland air services, i.e,, air services between the agencies. There are at present no recognised official air ma'l services operating between the various Agencies, but on occasions, vlzt., when sea communications have been very poor, opportunity has been taken by local officials to send mail by R.A.F. services: for example by R.A.F. service between Kuwait and Bahrain which is understood to operate twice a week, and between Dubai and Bahrain. If these services can be used officially for the conveyance of air mail, and there seems to be no reason why they should not, consideration will no doubt be given to the question of introducing an internal air mail postage rate for letters to be conveyed lormally by these services, which would afford appreciable acceleration. REMITTANCE SERVICES MONEY ORDERS (Ordinary and Air Mail). 1. Between U.K. and Agencies . There appears to be little demand for the service. A foreign Money Order is rarely issued in the Agencies, and the number paid averages but 2 or 3 a month. It is therefore recommended that the service should not be maintained. The less complicated postal Order system should suffice. 2. Local service between the Agencies . Very little demand - one or two only issued or paid each month. It is suggested that service should be discoatinued. ^fhe postal order system should meet requirements.)3. Between Agencies and India and/or Pakistan . Considerable use is made of this facility in the direction Agencies to India and/or Pakistan. Over a thousand Money Orders per month are issued at Bahrain, ^00 at Kuwait, 60 at Dubai and 100 at Muscat. And the numbers are tending to increase. In the direction India and/or Pakistan to the Agencies, the facility is not used to any great extent; about 23 a month are paid at Bahrain, and 10, 3, 3? a month respectively at Kuwait, Dubai and Muscat, It seems desirable that the service should be maintained, and as far as possible on existing Indian lines. A description of the existing Indian domestic system has already been supplied to the O.M.B. The method of accounting as between the United Kingdom and India/Pakistan should be on the following lines:- From the Persian Gulf to IndiaA 3 akistan. India/Pakistan to pay the original orders and to claim tnem + cashing allowance in the General Account, sending a statement with the paid Orders to the A.G.D., O.R.B. From India/Pakistan to the Persian Gulf. Gulf Post Offices to pay the original Orders issued in India/Pakistan and to forward them with the relative Money Order Schedule to the British Superintendent of posts, Bahrain. After check of the schedules, the Superintendent of posts would list the Orders in duplicate (say weekly) and send the top copy of the list and paid Orders to India/Pakistan with a request that the total amount + %fo cashing allowance should be credited to- the United Kingdom in the General Account. The undercopy of the list should be sent to A.G.D., O.R.B. for accounting and record purposes. It is not considered that this work should be delegated to the Sub-postmaster of Bahrain, at .any rate at the outset. He is already working -under considerable pressure, and it is very doubtful whether with the calibre of the staff available the work could be done satisfactorily. A, Between Agencies and countries other than U.K. and India/Pakistan. Very little demand. Foreign Money Orders rarely issued in the Agencies, and the number paid negligible - 2 or 3 a month. Recommend that service should be discontinued. MONEY ORDERS (Telegraph) . 3 . Between U.K. and Agencies . Very little demand. The service is at present confined to Kuwait only and the number paid or issued averages one or two per month. Recommend that service should not be maintained. ... 6. Between Agencies and India/Pakistan. The service is not used to a great extent: about 20 a month issued at Bahrain, 10 a month at Kuwait and 20 a month at Muscat. No service atat Dubai. It is thought however that the service my tend to increase, and it is recoEmended that it should be maintained (on Indian lines so far as possible). A description of the existing Indian domestic system has already been supplied to O.M.B. Accounting as between U.K. and India/pakistan should be on the same lines as in the case of Ordinary Money Orders. 7. Between Agencies . No demand. Service not to be mintained. Postal Orders. 8 . Imperial Postal Order Scheme . The traffic is not large. Numbers sold average 60 a month at Bahrain, 30 at Kuwait, 4 at Dubai and 2 at Muscat. Numbers paid average less than 6 per month at each office. Hecommend that service should be maintained. 9- Indian postal Orders . An average of 75 P G r month issued at Bahrain, and 3 a month at Dubai. System lias not been made available at Kuwait or at Muscat presumably because of the few Indians at those places. Number paid at Bahrain negligible - about 2 a month, and at Dubai 20 a month. It is assumed that there will be no question of issuing Indian postal orders in the Agencies; and the Pakistan authorities have indicated that the sending of Indian rupee postal orders to the Agencies will be discontinued. Trade Charge Money Orders. The total number of C.O.D. packets (letters or parcels) posted at all Agencies averages 5 a month (all destinations inland and foreign), and on these figures no justification can be found for maintaining the service outwards from the Agencies, On the other hand, about 70 C.O.D. items (mainly parcels) are received at Bahrain each month (from all sources), about 15 per month at Kuwait, 9 u month at Dubai, 40 a month at Muscat. It has not been possible to obtain definite information how these figures are split up as between the different countries of despatch, but the great majority seem to originate from India/pakistan or the U.K. (The U.K. figures can no doubt be obtained, if desired, from the U.K. despatching offices of exchange.) It does seem desirable therefore to allow the service to continue for parcels from India/Takistan to the Agencies and from U.K. to the Agencies, and because of this, the O.M.B. may wash to allow the facilities outwards from the Agencies to India/Pakistan and to the U.K. despite the small use made, A statement has already been forwarded showing the precise treatment at present in operation as regards Trade Charge Orders in respect of C.O.D. parcels from India/pakistan for the Agencies, and a similar statement giving details of the procedure adopted in the case of C.O.D. parcels from U.K. to Persian Gulf is being furnished separately. ItIt is not considered that a C.O.T. service should he provided for postal packets other than parcels ; and there appears to be no demand for a C.O.D. service of any kind to and from countries other than the U.K. and India/Pakistan, SAVINGS lUNK. BUSINESS, BTC. It was explained to the Pakistan authorities that the British post Office was not anxious, at any rate at the outset, to provide facilities of this kind, but was x^ e P^red, if desired, to liquidate responsibility of the Indian Posts and Telegraph:; Department for Indian Savings ikuik Accounts and National Savings Certificates. After discussion, it was agreed provisionally that in the circunstances the best solution would be for the inhabitants of the Gulf Agencies to be advised as early as possible that - (i) the Indian P. &amp; T. Dept, ms giving up the control of the postal etc. services in the Persian Gulf on the 31st of March 1948, and that after that date the British post Office would take over; and (ii) as a result those persons holding Indian Savings Bank Accounts, National Sarings Certificate and other Government securities should take immediate action to close their accounts. Any applications for withdrawal received after the 31 so of March 1948 to be passed to the Pakistan Postal authorities at Karachi for settlement. Thus, the British Post Office would be relieved from any re s ponsibility. The withdrawal of these facilities should not involve much hardship; savings could be paid instead into the local banks. , TELEGdoAPIS The position is as follows:- BAHRAIN Cable and Wireless perform the collection and delivery of telegrams, and the local postal administration handles no telegraph traffic. KUWAIT Thu telegraph line between Kuwait and Basra is maintained by the Indian posts and Telegraphs Department. It is understood that the batteries are maintained in Basra, but maintenance of the lino has to be maintained by Kuwait up to a distance of 77 miles to a place called Safwan. Line runs across desert in four distances Kuwait - Jasrah 22 miles Jasrah - Safwan 35 ” SafVan-Zubair-Basra 43 M A sub-inspector and 2 linemen are stationed at Kuwait. I was advised that the landline was inadequate, in bad condition and requires complete renewal. During interruptions of this'landline, traffic between Kuwait and Iraq is normally diverted via Bahrain/Pao cablecable, • The latter cable is, however, old and always liable to break and during the last few years -has been more often down than up. The monthly messages despatched and received over the line amount to about 600 in each direction. There is no inland telegraph system at Kuwait. MU SCAT Cable and Wireless perform the collection and delivery of telegrams, and there is no local telegraph administration, DUBAI There are no telegraph facilities, GWADUR See portion of report on this place. The telegra.ph situation in the Persian Gulf was fully discussed with the Political Resident (and Cable and Wireless officials), I explained that the Telecommunications Dept,, G.P.O,, London, was at present considering the question of developing radiotelephony in the Persian Gulf and that among the proposals was telephony between Kuwait and Iraq for which three alternatives were being considered. They were telephone landline, wireless telephony and a telephone cable, I explained also that the Telecommunications Dept, preferred to await their final consideration of the whole project before commenting on the question of taking over and maintenance of the.Kuwait-Basra telegraph line, Mr* Hurding, Officer-in-Charge, C. &amp; W., Kuwait, expressed the view that of the three alternatives mentioned above, C. &amp; W, preferred the wireless telephony as being the least difficult to maintain and/or the less expensive. POSTAGE STAMPS It is understood that British postage stamps overprinted 'BAHRAIN' and 'KUWAIT' respectively, and to bear the amounts in local currency, are being provided at the outset in the following denominations 7 =fd. stamp overprint -J- As. 1 d. ' ' 1 ' 14 -d. » ' » 2 d. ' ' 2 ' 2-J-d. ' ' 2-g- ' 3 d. ' ' • 3 H 6d. » » 6 ' and that a similar range of British stamps overprinted with anna values, but not bearing the name of the territory, is being provided for use in Muscat, Dubai, and, if necessary, at Gwadur. As already reported, it is considered most desirable that these should be supplemented as early as possible by some overprinted stamps of higher denominations say 1 rupee, 2 rupees, and 3 or 10 rupees, to meet the postage on parcels and heavy air mail items. WIRELESS&amp; - * 16. VttKELESS LICENCES No lioences are at present necessary for receiving sets; and the granting of licences for amateur wireless transmitting sets is contingent on the joint approval of the Pcliticaa. Agent and the Shaikh after the local Service authorities, e.g. the R.A.P.&gt; have been consulted. The Middle East -Communication Board are then asked if they have any objection. If they have none, the Government of India have hitherto been asked to allot a call sign. The Political Resident assumes that the British Post Office will deal with the allotment of call signs when they take over. The procedure described above may be held to apply to all the Gulf States except Muscat though it has up to date only been followed in Bahrain and Sharjah as no application for a licence has been made in any other State. GYdRDUR. It was explained to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf that the British Post Office was not anxious to take over any telegraph commitments, and to take over only the Post Office would be most uneconomical. The postal receipts averaged about Rs.80/- a month. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf expressed the opinion that from a general political point of view it would bo preferable for H.M. Government to take over postal and telegraph matters in Gwadur, and suggested that Cable and Wireless should be approached with the view of setting up a small wireless station there for communication with India and Muscat. / In that event it might be possible also to arrange for the Company to run the Post Office as a Sub-Post Office of Muscat. I was not able to visit Gwadur and was unable to get any figures of the relative telegraph traffic, but I was later advised by the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi, that the present office does in fact pay its way. The port has very poor communication, ships rarely call, and mails are conveyed by camel once a fortnight to Delhi via Quetta taking a minimum of 13 days in transmission. No air service is available. The existing telegraph line.Gwadur-Panjgur appears at present to be in bad .condition, but such as it is it is very essential to the native population (about 1 CM2,000) for trading i^iirposes. They deal mainly in the export of fish - and I was advised that if the telegraph line is stopped it would strangle trade and possibly result in the evacuation of the inhabitants to Karachi. The inhabitants had teen pressing for a long time past for better cconunication facilities; and there is no lalso explained the position to the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi last week, and he advised roe that the Pakistan adcrdni strati on will be prepared to continue the present postal and telegraph arrangements at Gwadur until such time as a decision has been reached* He expressed the view however that so long as the Pakistan administration run the postal and telegraph services at Gwadur, no change should be made in the existing services, conditions and postage rates, i.e. Gwadur should be regarded during this period as x^rt of Pakistan for postal and telegraph purposes. STAFFING. The Offices in the Persian Gulf are at present staffed as follows:- B/iHRAIN (Manama post Office) Nationality Languages Postmaster Persian Persian, Arabic, Urdu, English Clerk( 1 ) Arab Arabic, English ' ( 2 ) Punjabi Urdu s English and little Persian ' (3) Arab Arabic and a little English (one clerk o t; o jq requirements at time of insx 3 ection) 3 postmen locals 1 inferior servant local BAHRAIN (Muharraq Post Office) Postmaster Indian Urdu, English Postman local KDWJT Postmaster Punjabi English, Urdu, little Arabic and Persian Clerk (1) Persian English, Persian, Arabic, Urdu ' ( 2 ) Indian Urdu, English 3 postmen locals 2 inferior servants locals Sub Inspector Indian English, Arabic, Urdu, Persian 2 linemen ^ ; locals # DUBAI A .* • Postmaster Pakistan Urdu, English, Arabic, Persian Postman local MUSCAT 4 ' postmaster Punjabi English, Urdu, Arabic, little Persian Postman local The Political Resident confirmed that he would be responsible for engaging staff for the post Offices in the Persian Gulf; and he stated that he pro-posed to engage new staff and, if ^possible, locals oh contract18 . tems, say for a period of three years. Those of the x:&gt;resent employees who wished to carry on under His Majesty 1 s Government and who are now employed, by th$ Pakistan/Indian Government on x^ensionable terms would be advised to consider the question of terminating their service, with the Pakistan/Indian administration, taking such pension as they may be entitled to, and to enter into a contract, as mentioned above, for service under His Majesty^ Government. In the meantime, xoresent Pakistan/Indian Staff would be retained as already agreed, and if they were willing, on deputation terms. I understood that the political Resident would be communicating shortly with the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi on the subject. The Political Resident expressed the view that having regard to existing conditions, the salaries or wages paid to the staff, particularly the lower grade staff, were in some instances inadequate, and he assumes that when engaging new staff, or entering into contracts with present staff, any decision he may reach regarding the salaries or wages to be paid will not be questioned in any way. In this connexion, the question arises whether or not zin the case of subordinate staff engaged by the Political. Resident, their wages will be subject to British Income Tax. It appears likely that persons resident abroad drawing wages that have to be paid by the British tax payer may be subject to British Income Tax, and if such is the case, the Political Resident may wish to take this factor into consideration when assessing wages. Payment of salaries, wages, etc. It was agreed that the salary of the postal Sux&gt;erintendent should be paid by the Political Resident who will need to be advised by the A. G.D. of the actual amount to be paid each month, i.e., after British income tax has been deducted. Vages of subordinate staff, rents for Post Office property, etc., to be paid by the Postal Superintendent. Operation of postal services etc . The political Resident assumes that the operation of the postal, etc. services in the Persian Gulf Agencies will be matters entirely for the new postal Superintendent. The latter will, however, be required to refer to the political Resident all questions of policy and also to consult him on any important matters. The political Resident would be prepared, of course, to assist in any case in v/hich the Postal Superintendent needed advice. Supervision of post Office accounts. The political Resident desires that the general supervision of accounts for all Agencies should be undertaken by the postal Superintendent. The Political Resident would need to be furnished only with a statement each quarter showing briefly the income and exijenditure of each of the Agencies. The A.G.D. will no doubt advise as to form in v/hich this statement should beM 1 19. be prepared for submission to the political Resident. Provision of Funds to Post Office. The Political Resident agreed to undertake, subject to necessary authority from His Majesty's Government, to provide the postal Superintendent with fundsfor use in connexion with the operation of the postal services should this become necessary. Renewal of leases for Post Office prerases. This will be undertaken by the political Resident. ill S CEUjAHEQU S Work at Post Offices in Persian Gulf. In general, the staff at the various Post Offices in the Persian Gulf are well occupied, particularly so at the Manama Post Office, Bahrain. There is, however, very little business done at the Muharraq Post Office, Bahrain, the total income, nostlyfrco the sale of stamps, being 125 rupees a month. This Office was opened in 194-6 as an experiment and apart from the sale of stamps receives for posting or delivery about one parcel or registered letter per day. The postmaster and postman have very little to do all day, and it is considered that this Office is not warranted. The question of closing down this Office was suggested to the Political Resident, but he was not inclined at the time to give any definite views on the subject. It is suggested that the British Superintendent of Posts should keep an eye on this Office, and that if he also forms the opinion that it is not justified, he should consult the political Resident on the question of closing it down, and perhaps transferring the staff to Manama, which Office is working under extreme pressure. Quality of staff employed. The staff at each office appeared to be of average intelligence, but did not show any evidence of possessing any high degree of initiative, and I do not think that it would be advisable to make tne Bahrain most Office responsible for maintaining the accounts of the other Post Offices in the Persian Gulf, or to devolve upon that Office any further work as a result of the change-over. The British Superintendent of Posts should take on any v/ork of a general nature, arising from the change-over, at any rate at the outset, and also any correspondence work which might arise in connexion with the Persian Gulf services. Accommodation for British Superintendent of Posts The Political Resident agreed that the British Superintendent of posts was entitled to free accommodation, and would endeavour to find him such accommodation, as well as a small office, near the x^ost Office. Personal Clerk for Superintendent of Posts Having regard to the amount of work which will devolve upon the Superintendent of Posts, it is considered that he should have a personal clerk,m 21 Post Offices othervdse, and it was suggested by the political Resident that the question of the price should be left over for consideration with the general question of the handing over of political buildings in the Gulf frcn the Indian Govemiacnt to His Majesty’s Government. The 0.I1.B. already has a list of the property and equipment in Post Offices in the Persian Gulf, There are no Post Office buildings or land belonging to the Indian Postal &amp; Telegraph Dept, in the Gulf except at Gwadur. Minimum and maximum balances held at Post Offices in Persian Gulf. I enclose statedfnts, for the information of the A. G.D., showing the minimum and maximum balances authorised to be held by the various Post Offices, and the system under which remittances have to be exchanged. As already reported, I think it very desirable that the British Postal Superintendent should be sent to the Persian Gulf as early as possible in order to inspect the offices which will be under his control, to see the class of staff employed and to examine their methods of working. He could at the same time keep a watchful eye on the stores situation to ensure that there will be no shortage at the outset. As already indicated, the above recommendations and remarks have been based entirely on my discussions with the Pakistan postal authorities and the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf, and hove in general been agreed Apps.G.n,I. by them. Copies of minutes on the subject which I handed to the Political Resident, and to the Director General of posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi, before my departure are attached, together with the reply from the Political Resident. Colonel Spear, the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi did not, give me an official reply, but he authorised me to say that he concurred generally in the reca.mendations• He stated however that he had to submit the case to Ids Government for approval and that when this was obtained, he would send an official reply to the Postmaster General, London. In conclusion, I would like to add that this, ny first visit to the East, proved a most delightful experience, and the warm weather, good feeding and above all the most cordial hospitality bestowed on me by all with whom I came into contact made the tour all the more pleasant. I am very grateful to the Department for giving me this opportunity to see a little of the outside world. W. Appleby 23 December, 194770145/46 Dear Mias Shaw, y/ U-!

It is assumed that. a^as at Tangier, the pay of locally engaged staff would not be subject to British Income Tax, There is also the matter of provision of a personal cleric for the Postal Superintendent (see page 19 of the Report), In Vac? , -&gt;i the amount of work involved and the large area to be eoVered we i n favour of this proposal, the more especially as the question of the appointaient of a Deputy or Assistant Postal Super intendent has been deferred for the present, as you will no doubt recall, at the request of the Political Resident, It is assumed that the Political Resident will be authorised through tiie Cotrsnonwrealth Relations Office to provide funds for use in connexion with the operation of the postal services, as and when necessary, and that he vill be empowered to review leases for Post Office premises and draw up local contracts for the conveyance of mails in concert with the Postal Superintendent. ^ The Treasury would of course be consulted if necessary in individual oases and the costs would be met from the Post Office Vote, Subject to anything wiiioh Mr, Harrison may have to say I should be glad if you would give authority for the lost Office and Common wealth Relations Office to proceed on the lines indicated above as early as possible.

Proposed Air Mail Service Kuwait-Basra; I am advised that the Common?/ealth Relations Office, London support your vIqyj that the rapid growth of Kuwait, due to oil development, makes the introduction of an air service there desirable, and that they are anxious to do^whatever is possible to further this idea. So far as the carriage of air mail is concerned, it would cf co&gt;urse be ^referable for this to be handled by a British Company employing British air crews, and before considering whether to accept your proposal that an air mail contract should be placed with Iraqi Airways, the C.R.0., have asked the Ministry of Civil Aviation whether it would not be possible in the near future to make Kuwait a calling place for aircraft of the B.O.A.C. service U.K,~ Bahrain. The C.R.0. pointed out to the M.C.A. that (l) oil development at Kuwait was likely to be on a greater scale than at Bahrain and in consequence the linking of Kuwait with a regular air service seemed most desirable. (2) it would give the Oil Company the greatly improved facilities for the movement of their personnel and ( 3 ) it would do a great deal to enhance British prestige at Kuwait and would be of the ,reatest assistance to the Political authorities in the Gulf. There is^also the further point that it seems probable that an arrangement for regular calls ‘ J f L.O.A.C. aircraft at Kuwait would form a string inducement to the Company to accept responsibility for the control and management of aerodromes there as the Agents cf H.M.G. It is not unlikely that, if asked to do so, they would also co-operate fully in providing the facilities which would be required for the operation of flying boats in the Kuwait Bay. You will no doubt be advised by C.R,0. cf further developments. In the meantime, G.P.0. London is also examining the position. (Sgd) W. Appleby. 14 November, 1947.Appendix G-, The Political Resident, # , Following upon ny recent preliminary discussions with the Pakistan postal authorities, my inspection of the Bahrain and Kuwait Post Offices, and my discussions with you regarding the taking over by the British Post office on the 1st of April, 1948 of the control of the postal, etc. services in the Persian Oulf, I think it well (i.e. before my departure from Bahrain) to set out belov/ the position as I see it up-to-date, and the recommendations which, on the data available, I propose to make to my Headquarters as to the services to be provided. It will be seen that it is x^roposed to maintain existing services so far as practicable, but as you will readily appreciate, it will be necessary to alter the existing postage rates or charges in many instances, as well as the conditions apxjlicable to x-articular services, so as to fit in with the machinery of the British Post Office. One of the most important alterations will be the change-over from 'inland' to 'foreign' rates and conditions as regards postal matter posted in the Persian Gulf Agencies addressed to Pakistan and/or India, inasmuch as anything going overseas from the Gulf, even to Pakistan and/or India, will have to be treated as Imperial and Foreign matter under the British Post Office Act and the Postal Union Convention.

Service (payment of Customs charges by sender) No service This service is available in India and/or Pakistan, but there appears to have been no demand for such a service in the Persian Gulf. . AIR MAIL SERVICES The main effect of the change of control will be that communication with India and/or I-akistan will be international instead of internal . This means that the existing.cheap air mail rates from the Persian Gulf to India and/or Pakistan will have to be increased. An economic rate covering the whole of India and/or Pakistan, and the use of Indian airservices, v/ould be about 6 annas per half ounce (this is inclusive of, and not additional to, ordinary postage). It might however also be practicable to offer a separate air postage rate for letters addressed to Pakistan not requiring internal air transmission within Pakistan, viz: annas per half ounce. The latter rate would be extremely beneficial for air mail letters addressed only to Karachi. The air postage rates to other countries will be affected by reas. : of the fact that the Gulf ports are in a different financial zone from India for the purpose of air conveyance charges, and it seems likely that the rates to countries westwards can be reduced while the rates for countries eastwards may have to be increased. For example, an air postage rate of 6 annas per half ounce could perhaps be justified for letters addressed to the United Kingdom (as compared with the existing rate of 12 annas per half ounce). Air mail rates for the Western Hemisphere generally might be at slightly less than those existing at ’present: 'possibly the sum of the rates from the Agencies to the United Kingdom, and from U.K. to destination, e.g. about IPs. per half ounce for letters for the U.S.A. An air letter form at 6 annas might be allowed to any country, including the Y/estern Hemisphere. The whole question of the air postage rates -is, however, already under consideration by my Headquarters, and full details will be forwarded to you as soon as a decision has been reached. Proposed air mail service betv/een Kuwait and Basra The position is as explained in my report of the lAth of November. Savings Dank Business The British Post Office is not anxious, at any rate at the outset, to provide facilities of this kind, but is prepared, if desired, to liquidate responsibility of the Indian Post &amp; Telegraph Department for Indian Savings Bank Acdounts and National Savings Certificates. During my preliminary discussions at Karachi, it was suggested informally, that the best solution would perhaps be for the inhabitants of the Gulf Agencies to be advised as early as possible that(i) the Indian rest &amp; Telegraph Department was giving up the control of the postal, etc. services in the Persian Gulf on the 31st of March, 1940, and that after that date the British Post Office would take over, and (ii) as a result those persons holding Indian Savings Dank Accounts, National Savings Certificates and other Government securities should take immediate action to close their accounts. Any applications for withdrawal received after the 31st of March, 1948 to be passed to the Pakistan postal authorities at Karachi for settlement. Thus the British Post Office would be relieved of any responsibility. I do not think that the withdrawal of these facilities will involve much hardship: savings could be paid instead into the local banks. The question is however now receiving official consideration by the Pakistan authorities, and the final decision will be communicated as soon as possible. Wireless Licences It appears that licences are not at present necessary for receiving sets, and that applications for transmitting licences, which are rare, are subject to the joint approval of the Shaikh concerned and yourself. I understand that it is your view that this practice should be maintained, i.e t applications for transmitting licences and for allocation of frequencies to be dealt with locally as they arise.

I have also recommended to my Headquarters the desirability of providing as early as possible overprinted stamps of the 1 Rupee and 2 Rupee denominations for use at all Agencies, and intend, furthermore, to recommend the provision of at least one higher value overprinted stamp, say for 5 or It rupees, to meet the postage on heavy air mail packets. Telegraphs, etc. • At Dahraifl, Cable and Wireless performs the collection and delivery of telegrams, and the local administration handles no telegraph traffic. At Kuwait , Cable and Wireless performs the collection and delivery and there is no inland telegraph system. overprint 1 2 anna overprint 1 anna «rv overprint li annas overprint 2 annas overprint 2j annas overprint 3 annas overprint 6 annas The position in regard to the taking over of the Kuwait - Basra land line was explained in my report of the 14th of November. I have not yet visited Muscat, Dubai or Gwadur, but I understand that at Muscat Cable and Wireless performs the collection and delivery of telegrams, and that there is no local telegraph administration. At Sharjah an d b.A.u.C, at present operate a wireless circuit with Cable and Wireless at Bahrain. Dubai , the commercial centre of this area, is some 10 miles from Sharjah, and our only information so far is that telegraph traffic between the two places is conveyed by B.Q.A.C, motor transport. There is little information of Gwadur . Traffic from this area reaches U.K. from the Indian Department at Karachi or Bombay, GWADUR The Jritish Rost office is not anxious to assume control of the telegraph arrangements, and to take over only the Post office at Gwadur would be most uneconomical. The postal receipts average about Rs, 80/- a month. The oritish Post Office would much prefer therefore, subject to the consent of the Sultan of Muscat (which consent, with reservations, has, I understand now been obtained) that the Pakistan Government should be asked to continue the existing postal and telegraph arrangements. As the volume of postal traffic between Muscat and Gwadur is probably very small the British lost office would have no reluctance, if the point is raised, to handling the traffic for the reduced inter-port postage rates under arrange ment with Pakistan. I understand, however, that (i) from a general political point of vie?/ you dislike the idea of postal and telegraphic matters at Gwadur being left in the hands of Pakistan.1 ii) you are of the opinion that the lajid line between Gwadur - ranjgur is m bad condition, needs considerable repair, and is in any case likely soon to cease to function (iii) Your provisional view is that pressure should be put on Cable and Wireless to run a smll wireless station for communication with (a) India and Muscat or (b) Muscat only. In that event it might be possible to arrange for Cable and Wireless to run the Post Office as a sub-post office , of Muscat. It seems therefore that the future of Gwadur is dependent upon (l) the willingness of Cable and Wireless to open up a wireless station there and (2) if so, the length of time required to open it up. Even if willing to do so, provisional arrangements would have to be made for the running of the Post Office unless the wireless station was ready by the 1st of April, 194p. Although you dislike the idea of Pakistan carrying on with the postal and telegraphic business at Gwadur as a permanent measure, you might perhaps be prepared to ask them to continue the present arrangements until such time as a definite decision on the matter has been reached. STAFFING, Etc. It is understood that you propose to engage new staff, and, if possible locals, on contract terms, say for a period of 3 years. Those of the present employees who wish to carry on under His Majesty's Government, and who are now employed by the Indian/Pakistan Government on pensionable terms will be advised to consider the question of terminating their service with the Indian/ Pakistan administration, taking such pension as they may be entitled to, and to enter into a contract, as mentioned above, for service under His Majesty's Government. In the meantime, present Indian/Pakistan staff to be retained, if they are willing, on deputation terms. British Postal Superintendent. It has been recommended to my Headquarters that the British Postal Superintendent should be posted to Bahrain as soon as possible in the New Year to give him an opportunity for inspecting the Post offices which will be under his control, the class of staff employed and their methods of working. I understand that rent free accommodation will be found for him. It seems desirable that accommodation should, if possible, be near the Post Office, and I gather that you are endeavouring to obtain such accommodation. It also seems desirable that the Postal Superintendent should have a personal clerk, if possible a shorthand typist and preferably an Indian, and it is understood that you will endeavour to engage such an officer. Payments of salaries, wages, etc. It is proposed that the salary of the Postal Superintendent should be paid by you, as Political Resident, The actual amount to be paid each month, i.e. after deduction of British income tax, to be advised to you by the Accountant General's Department, G.P.G., London. Wages of subordinate staff, rents for Post Office property etc. to be paid by the Postal Superintendent. OPERATION OF POSTAL SERVICES The operation of the postal services to be a matter entirely for the new postal Superintendent. The latter will however be required to refer to you all questions of policy, and to consult you on any important matter. He may however seek your advice whenever he needs assistance. SUPERVISION OF POST OFFICE ACCOUNTS I understand that it is your desire that the general supervision of accounts for all Postal Agencies should be undertaken by the Postal Superintendent, and that you will need to be furnished only with a statement say, each quarter, showing briefly the income and expenditure particulars of each of the Agencies, v,: RENEWAL P LRENEV/AL GF LEikSES FOR POST OFFICE PREMISES I understand that you will undertake this. PROVISION OF.FENDS FOR POST OFFICES I understand that, subject to authority from His Majestyk Government you will undertake to provide the lostal Superintendent with funds for use in connection with the operation of the postal etc, services should this become necessary (which is unlikely). POST OFFICE STORES, STAMPS, ETC. All Post Office stores, except stamps or other valuable items, to be sent direct to the Postal Agency concerned* Stands and ether valuable items, to be sent to the Political Agent for the appropriate Agency for distribution to the Postal Agency as and when required. POST OFFICE FURNITURE, EQUIPMENT, ETC. The question as to whether this should be taken over by His Majesty's Government and the price, to be considered in connexion with the general question of the handing over of political buildings in the Gulf from the Indian Government to His Majesty’s Government. I shall be very glad to be advised whether you concur generally in the recommendations and remarks quoted above. (Sgd) W. Appleby. ’LD‘ British Post office Representative 24th N cvemb e r, 1947.Ai^pendix H, CONFIDENTIAL D.O, No, 2014-S. PEASIAN GULF RESIDENCY, DAHFAIN, the 25th November, 1547. Dear Appleby, I acknowledge with many thanks your note giving details of the recommendations which you propose to make to your headquarters regarding the postal services to be provided in the Gulf States. I concur generally in your recommendations and have only the following comments to make. 2. With regard to your remarks regarding wireless licences at page 5 the position is that the granting of licences for amateur wireless transmitting sets is contingent on the joint approval of the Political Agent and the Shaikh after the local service authorities e.g, the R.A.F. have been consulted. The Middle East Communications Board are then asked if they have any objepticn. If they have none the Government of India are asked to allot a call sign. I presume that when the G.P.0. have taken over they will deal with the allotment of call signs. The procedure described in this paragraph may be held to apply to all the Gulf States except Muscat though it has up to date only been followed in Bahrain and Sharjah as no application for a licence has been made in any other State. 3. With reference to the remarks regarding telegraphs at Kuwait on page 6 the collection and delivery of telegrams despatched and received over the Kuwait-Basra land line is I believe performed by the post office and not by Cable and Wireless. 4. With reference to your remarks about Gwadur at pages 6 and 7 I should be grateful if you could let me have a further note after you have visited the place. I would suggest that the present overland postal service should be abolished and that all mails should be despatched by B.I. steamers which call regularly in each direction once in six weeks. This should result in a considerable saving and the service should I think be sufficient for the needs of the place in view of the fact that telegraphic facilities are available. 5. With reference to your remarks about staffing on page 7 the Pakistan Government will have to be consulted about the further employment of the present staff and may have their own views on the subject. I will endeavour to obtain a personal clerk for the Postal Superintendent but am very doubtful if I shall be able to find a satisfactory shorthand typist. I should be grateful for early information regarding the date from which the clerk will be required. 6. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the thoroughness with which you have examined our postal system here and of all the trouble you have taken in working cut the arrangements for its transfer to His Majesty's Government. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) W.R. HAY. V/, Appleby, Esquire, BAHRAINAppendix I. To The Director-General, rosts &amp; Telegraphs (-pak.) KARACHI. Subject:- PERSIAN GULF POSTAL SERVICES, ETC., I have now visited the Post Offices at Bahrain, Kuweit, Dubai Sc Muscat, and have had many discussions with Sir Rupert Hay, the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf, with the Political Agents for the tenitLiies Concerned, with Cable and Wireless representatives and with others directly interested in the question of the taking over by the British Post office on the 1st of April, 1940 of the postal etc. services in the Gulf. As a result, and having regard to the further discussions with yourself and members of y~ur staff, I propose to report to my Headquarters on the lines indicated below:- It will be seen that it is proposed to maintain the present services so far as practicable but, as you will appreciate, it will be necessary to alter the existing postage rates or charges in many instances, as well as the conditions applicable to particular services, so as to fit in with the machinery of the British P ; ost office. One of the most important features will be the change-over from 'inland” to 'foreign” rates and conditions in regard to postal matter posted in the Persian Gulf Agencies addressed to Pakistan/India, inasmuch as anything going overseas from the Gulf, even to Pakistan/India will have to be treated as Imperial and Foreign matter under the British post Office Act and the Postal Union Conventi-n.

The No. of V.P. Parcels posted in the Gulf is very small-during a period of A months one such parcel only was posted” and in the circumstances it will rem^i for further consideration by my headquarters whether or not the service should be maintained. It is clearly !undesirable to set up jcomplicated machinery for a I service for which there is no demand. It is proposed at the outset to maintain the existing postage rates for all countries over except Pakistan/India. seas, For Pakistan/India it is proposed that the rates should be - 1 r. 1 ” 2 ' 3 ' 6 ' Up to 2 lbs. i t» ^ ” ' 7 ’•11 ”22 6 a. 9 ' 9 12 ” it u No service The rate! for Pakistan/ India have been based on (a) Handling costs in Persian Gulf (b) Sea costs and (c) Territorial credits due to Pakistan or India. The cost of (c) are 8 a., 8 a, 1 rupee, 1 rupee 8 a., and 2 rupees 4 a. res pectively for 2,3,7,11 and 22 lbs. parcels, and the costs of (a) have been fixed provisionally at same amounts, although in fact actually less under present conditions. Sea costs (b) have been estimated at 6 a, 9 a, 9 a, 12 a, 1 r. 6 a, respectively. Any transit credits that may be due to Pakistan for parcels transiting that dominion for India, or due to India for parcels transiting that Dominion for Pakistan, have been ignored for the purpose of the assessment of xjestage rates - the British P.0, will bear any small loss arising in respect of such parcels. No demand SEA MAIL CONTRACT As regards contract with B.I.S.N. Co., it is understood that the Indian P. &amp; T. Department will continue to 'pay for it, and that whatever mails are carried by these steamers, or any other steamers under contract with the Government of India, will have to be paid for at Postal Union Convention races. AIR MAIL SERVICES. The main effect of the change of control will be that communication with Pakistan/lndia will be international instead of internal . This means that the existing cheap air mail rates from the Persian Gulf to Pakistan/India will have to be increased. An economic rate covering the whole of Pakistan/ India, and the use of Pakistan/Indian Air Services, would be about 6 annas perNo demand: service to be discontinued. Postal •r (23) per half-ounce, (This'is inclusive of, and not additional to ordinary postage,). It night however be practicable to offer a separate air r cs a.o rate, say, £ annas per half-ounce, for letters addressed to Pakistan not requiring internal air transmission within Pakistan, e.g., for letters addressed to Karachi, The air postage rates to other countries will be affected by reason of the fact that the Gulf ports are in a different financial^zone from In^ia for the purpose of air conveyance charges, and it seems likely that the ai: postage rates to countries westwards can be reduced, while the rates tor countries eastwards may have to be increased. For example, an air pcs age rate of 6 annas per half-ounce could perhaps be justifieo for letters addressed to the United Kingdom (as compared with the existing rate of 1^ annas per half-ounce). Air Mail rates for the Western hemisphere generally night be at blightly less rates than those existing at present: ^cs ~ y the sum of the rates from the Agencies to the U.K. and from J.K. destination. An air letter form at 6 annas might be allowed t 6 any country, including the Western hemisphere. The whole question of the air postage rates is, however, already under consideration by my Headquarters, and full details will be for war de c you as soon as a decision has been reached. REMITTANCE SERVICES. Money Orders (ordinary and Air Mail). (1) Between U.K. &amp; Gulf Agencies., There appears to be little demand for the service, and it is proposed to discontinue it. The less complicated postal Order system should suffice. (2) Local Service between Gulf Agencies. There appears to be little demand for the service, and it is proposed to discontinue it. The. less complicated Postal Order system should suffice. ( 3 ) Between Agencies &amp; Pakistan/India . To be maintained as far as practicable on existing lines; considerable use is made of this service. ( 4 ) Between countries other than U.K. and Pakistan/India ana • the Agencies. Little demand. To be discontinued. Money Orders (Telegraph). (1) Between U.K. and Agencies . This facility is at present confined to Kuwait only and very little use 1 is made of it.

(1) British Postal Order Scheme. To be maintained. (2) Indian Postal Orders , Issue &amp; payment to be discontinued, POSTAG-E STAMPS British postage stamps overprinted 'Bnl-iRAIN' 'KUWAIT' respectively, and to bear the amounts in local currency, are being provided at the outset in the following denominations d, stamp, ’ overprint p u m 11 T ± II II II ± 2 2 » '» • H p± it n 11 *-2 ^ 11 11 11 ^11 11 11 A similar range of British stamps overprinted with anna values, but not bearing the name of the territory, is being provided for use in Muscat, Dubai and, if necessary, at G-walur. I have also recommended to my Headquarters the desirability of providing as early as possible overprinted stamps of higher denominations for use at all offices to meet the postage on parcels and heavy air mail packets. TELEGRAPHS. The position seems to be as fellows BnHRrilN . Cable and Wireless performs the collection and delivery of telegrams, and the local postal administration handles no telegraph traffic. dUdnlT . The Pakistan/lndisflaPosts &amp; Telegraphs Department maintain the telegraph line between Kuwait and Basra. I understand that the line is inadequate, in bad condition and requires complete renewal, and that Cable and Wireless can dispose of the traffic from Kuwait by wireless to Bahrain and thence by cable to Fac and on to Basra. Even so, however, the latter cable is old and always liable to break and during the last few years has been more' efteh down- than up. The London G.P.0. Telecommunications Department has under consideration the question of -developing radio telephony in the Persian Gulf and amongst the proposals is telephony between Kuwait and Iraq for which three alternatives are being considered. They are telephone landline, wireless telephony and telephone cable; and the Telecommunications Department has advised.that they would prefer to await their final consideration of the whole project before commenting on the question of taking over and maintenance of the' existing.Kuwait - Basra land line. MUSCAT . Cable &amp; Wireless performs the collection and delivery of telegrams and there is no local telegraph administration. DUBAI . There are no telegraph facilities at Dubai. GWADUR. I was unable to visit this place, and there is little information available. Traffic from this area reaches U.K. from the Pakistan or Indian Department at Karachi or Bombay - but see below. SAVINGSSAVINGS BANK BUSDnTESS, ETC. The British Post Office is not anxious, at any rate at the outset, to provide facilities of this kind, but is prepared if desired to liquidate • responsibility of the Indian Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department for Indian Savings Bank Accounts and National Savings Certificates, It is suggested that in the circumstances the best solution would be for the inhabitants of the Gulf Agencies to be advised as early as possible that - (i) the Indian p* &amp; T. Deptt. is giving up the control of the postal etc. services in the Persian Gulf on the 31st of March 194-S, and that after that date the British Post Office will take over; and (ii) as a result those persons holding Indian Savings Bank Accounts, National Savings Certificates and other Government securities should take immediate action to close their accounts. Any applications for withdrawal received after the 31st of March, 19^-8 to be passed to the Pakistan Postal authorities at Karachi for settlement. Thus, the British post Office will be relieved from any responsibility. The withdrawal of these facilities should not involve much hardship; savings could be paid instead into the local banks. G V/ A PUR. The British Post Office is not anxious to take over any telegraph commitments, and to take over only the rost Office would be most uneconomical. The postal receipts average about Rs. 80/- a month. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf has expressed tho opinion that from a general political point of view it would be preferable for K.M. Government to take over postal and telegraph matters in Gwadur, and suggests that Cable and Wireless should be approached with the view of setting up a small wireless station there for communication with India and Muscat. In that event it might be possible also to arrange for the Company to run the post Office as a Sub-post Office of Muscat. I was not able to visit Gwadur and have been unable so far to get any figures of the relative telegraph traffic, but I understand that the present office does in fact pay its way. The port has very poor communication, ships rarely call, and mails are conveyed by camel a fortnight to Delhi via Quetta taking a minimum of 13 days in transmission. No air service is available. The existing telegraph line Gwadur-Panjgur appeals at present to be in bad condition, but it is very essential to the native population (about 10-12,000) for trading purposes - they deal mainly in the export of fish - and I am advised that if the telegraph line is stopped it will strangle trade and possibly result in the evacuation of the inhabitants to Karachi. The inhabitants have been pressing for a long time past for better communication facilities; and there is no douot that there would be a great uproar if the present facilities were worsened. In the circumstances, the position will be communicated to my Headquarters for a decision on the point. on the meantime, I understana that the Pakistan administration will be prepared to continue the present postal and telegraph arrangements at Gwadur until such time as a decision has been reached. I understand also that so long as the Pakistan Administration run the postal &amp; telegraph services at Gwadur, you would prefer that no change should be made in the existing services, conditions and postage rates, i.e., that Gwadur should be regarded during this peno^ as part of Pakistan for postal &amp; telegraph purposes. STAFFING* * % STAFF I N G. The Political Resident will be responsible for engaging staff for the Post Offices in the Persian Gulf; and he has advised that he proposes to engage new staff and, if possible locals on contract terns, say for a x-^eriod of three years. Those of the present employees who wish to carry on under His Majesty's Government and who are now employed by the Pakistan/India Government on pensionable terms will be advised to consider the question of ^ terminating their service with the Pakistan/Indian administration, taking such x^ension as they may be entitled to, and to enter into a contract, as mentioned above, for service under His Majesty's Government. In the meantime, present Pakistan/India staff will be retained as already agreed, if they are willing on deputation terms. I understand that the Political Resident will be communicating with you shortly on this subject. POST OFFICE STORES. As a result of the change over in control, British forms and documents will have to be printed in place of the present pakistan/lndianforms, etc. Steps to t is end are being taken, but in view of the short time available, I fear that it may not be practicable to get some of the necessary new forms and documents printed and sent out to the offices concerned in time for the take over. I understand that while all existing stores on hand at the Agencies on the 1st of April may be taken over by the British post Office if so desired, the Pakistan administration is reluctant to supply or to loan any further stores after that date because of the paper situation in Pakistan. I gather, however, that in the event of emergency the Pakistan administration will do its utmost to supply at the expense of the British P-st Office such forms as may be required, or otherwise endeavour to arrange for such forms to be printed in Pakistan. No guarantee on this point can, however, be given. POST OFFICE FURNITURE, EQUIrMENT, ETC. The question as to whether this should be taken over by His Majesty's Government, and’the x^rice, to be considered in connection with the general question of the handing over of political buildings in the Gulf from the Indian Government to His Majesty's Government. I wish to emphasize that the foregoing proposals in regard to services, rates, etc. should be regarded merely as recommendations v/hich I shall make to my Headquarters where consideration vail be given to the various points and the decisions communicated to you as early as £&gt;ossible. In the meantime, I shall be glad to be advised v/hether so far as concerns the Pakistan administration, you concur generally in the recommendations and remarks quoted above. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, has seen the recommendations and has in general agreed with them - vide letter annexed the return of which will be appreciated. I should like to add that I am greatly indebted to all members of your staff for the assistance they have readily given me in connection with my enquiries. K.S. Abdul Hamid, the Officer deputed to accompany me to the Persian Gulf ports was very helpful indeed with his knowledge of postal matters generally, and I very much appreciated his efforts (and those of his bearer) to make the tour as comfortable as possible for me. He was in addition a most pleasant and entertaining companion and was well liked by all those with whom we come into contact. (Sgd) W. Appleby. 10 December, 1947V 26 f' r r v 701^.5/46 Tos. January, 1948 Dear Miss Shaw Persian Gulf I enclose two copies of Appleby’s report of the 23rd of December on his tour of the Persian Gulf. .The enclosures to the report, with the exception of two forms and a postal report of limited interest, are being typed and copies will be sent to you as soon as they are available. Certain matters - e.g. those dealing with staffin;' and postage rates - will, of course, have to be pursued individually and we shall write to you separately on these when we are ready, but in the meantime, it would be helpful if you would kindly let us have any observations on mattersof principle or^detail which v/ould assist us in disposing of the points still remaining at issue. \Ve are awaiting a communication from Pakistan (see penultimate paragraph of the Report) but we shall proceed with our arrangements on the assumption that there will be no difficulty from that quarter. We hope to let Breach, our Postal Superintendent, have full instructions by the beginning of March as it will take him some tine to implement them and time is short. You will see that the question of the line of demarcation of authority as between the Political Resident and the Postal Superintendent Miss P.C. Shaw, Treasury Chambers S.W.l,f Superintendent is touched on in the report. We will be writing to Mr. Harrison about this in due course, and also about the communications which should be sent by the British, Indian and Pakistan postal administrations to the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union. I am sending copies of this letter and enclosures to Messrs. Harrison (C.R.O.) and Pyman (F.O.) who will also no doubt comment if they so desire. To get the thing nicely finished off in the time at our disposal will extend us to the utmost. Yours sincerely,1 The Overseas Mails Branch, 'i Persian Gulf Postal, etc. Services. As instructed, I journeyed by air from the United Kingdom to Karachi on the 19 th of October for preliminary discussions with the Pakistan postal authorities on the question of the arrangements necessary in connexion with the transfer of the Persian Gulf postal, etc. services to H.M. Government. The preliminary talks over, I proceeded to Bahrain, accompanied by an officer of the Pakistan Post and Telegraph Department, for further discussions with Sir Rupert Hay, the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf, and then proceeded in turn to Kuwait, Ifcabai and Muscat for inspection of the Post Offices at those places. I then returned to Karachi for final discussions with the Pakistan authorities. During my visits to all these places, I also had many talks with the Political Agents for the territories concerned, with Cable and Wireless representatives, and v/ith others directly interested in the question of the taking over by the British Post Office of the postal, etc. services in the Gulf. In addition, I visited the Shaikh of Bahrain, and was visited by the Secretary to the Shaikh of Kuwait. On the basis of these discussions and inspections the follov/ing recommendations and remarks are made. It will be seen that it is proposed to maintain the present services so far as practicable, but, as will be appreciated, it will be necessary to alter the existing postage rates or charges in many instances, as well as the conditions applicable to particular services, so as to fit in with the machinery of the British post Office. One of the most important features will be the change-over from 'inland” to 'foreign' rates and conditions in regard to postal matter posted in the Persian Gulf Agencies addressed to India and Pakistan, inasmuch as anything going overseas from the Gulf, even to India and Pakistan, will have to be treated as Imperial and Foreign matter under the British Post Office Act and the Postal Union Convention, SERVICES IN THE PERSIAN GULF WHICH SHOULD IT IS PROPOSED BE MAINTAINED OR DISCONTIMJED SERVICE Letters A.

The handling costs in the Agencies are very small under present conditions and the sea costs, although not definitely fixed, will probably be in the neighbourhood of 1-J- annas per lb. The present rate of 6 annas per lb. should therefore adequately cover the costs, and it seems unnecessary to make any change. The number of parcels exchanged between Agencies is/very small - about one a month.SERVICE PROPOSED Rx'iTES OP POSTAGE OBSERVATIONS BMHNMK Registration Insurance. Fees payable in addition to postage; 3 annas covering compensation up to equivalent of £3 A annas covering compensation up to equivalent of £20 3 annas covering compensation up to equivalent of £4-0 and so on up to £4-00 at the rate of an additional anna for each £20 jSee under Registration . The existing registration system in ' the Persian Gulf is not a system of insurance as in the U.K. inland service, a fixed fee of 3 annas being payable to cover compensation of 23 rupees (37/6) per item. If compensation in excess of amount mentioned is desired, recourse must be had to separate insurance system. It is preposed to bring the system into line with the practice in the {Jnited Kingdom. Furthermore, under existing (Indian) regulations, registration is obligatory for all parcels exceeding AA0 tolas in weight and for all parcels requiring Customs Declarations, i.e. parcels ( sent from one Agency to another. This practice should be discon tinued, and registration made an optional service as in the U.K. inland service. The number of parcels exchanged Between Agencies is small - about one a month.

(See that part of this report headed Remittance Services). ' The number of parcels posted in tho Gulf for countries overseas is not large - about 35^ a month - and almost all of these are posted in Bahrain or Kuwait, It is recommended that arrangements should be made if possible for all parcels for the U.K, or transiting U.K ., to be sent by direct ship (strick Line) from Bahrain or Kuv/ait. (This service is already used in the direction U.K. - Persian Gulf.) In that event, the existing postage rates from India and the Persian Gulf, which have been recently increased, should adequately cover the costs. Parcels from the Gulf for other countries are not numerous, and as the handling charges in the Gulf are negligible it is recommended that existing rates on these parcels also should be maintained, i. e. the British Post Office to bear any small loss that might arise due to the cost of sea transport from the Gulf ports to Karachi, Bombay, or Basra by B.I.S.N. vessels. The proposed rates for India and Pakistan have been based on (a) hand ling costs in Persian Gulf (b) sea costs and (c) territorial credits due to India or Pakistan. The costs of (c) are 8a., 8a., 1 rupee, 1 rupee 8a., and 2 rupees 4a« respectively for 2, 3, 11&gt; end 22 lb. parcels, and the costs of (a) have been fixed provision ally at the same amounts, although in fact actually much less under present conditions.7. % OBSERVATIONS ■ ■■ ■ - —— — ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ — ! conditions.

The number of parcels posted in the Gulf for India or Pakistan is less than 30 a. month. F.D.D. service No service No demand Imperial and Paid only in Persian Gulf and not International issued. Reply Coupons Additional notes on mail services. (i) Limits of weight and size of postal packets. The existing limits of weight and size of certain categories of x-ostal packets vary in some instances from those applicable to similar categories of postal packets in the services from the United Kingdom, and whilst it is desirable that the United Kingdom limits should be adopted as soon as possible, too much stress should not perhaps be placed on this aspect at the outset, bincc too many changes at the same time will only serve to confuse the native postal officials. The changes could be brought in gradually. (ii) Mail contracts . B.I.S.N. Contract . The Indian P. &amp; T. Dept, have agreed to continue to pay for it, and whatever mails are carried by B.I.S.N. steamers, or other vessels under contract with India, will have to be paid for at postal Union • Convention rates. Other contracts . Two other contracts appear to have been made. One for the conveyance of air mails beWeen the post Office at Bahrain and the airport at a payment of 1+00 rux^ees a month to a local contractor. The other, also A00 rupees a month, for the carriage of mails between Kuwait and Zubair (Iraq) by the Kuwait Zubair Transport Co. The latter service is used in preference to the slow steamship service between Kuwait and Basra, mainly for SERVICE Parcels (cont*!,) PROPOSED RATES OF POSTAGE8 . for the carriage of air mil correspondence; and a copy of the relative contract is attached. The Political Agent, Kuwait, has hitherto drawn X App. A. up this contract on behalf of the Indian p. &amp; T. Dept., and is prepared ^ to continue to do so, if desired, for His Majesty^ Government, l J ayment for both these services is made by the local Post Offices, and this arrangement should not perhaps be disturbed. As regards, however, the Kuwait-Zubair land service, as the O.M.B. is aware, it has been suggested by the Political Resident that this service should be discontinued, air mails being sent instead by the Iraqi Airways thrice weekly air service between Kuwait and Basra, and the surface mails by shi^); and this suggestion is supported. The O.M.B. are no doubt already giving consideration to the air mail aspect. (iii) Communications . Communication with the Gulf Ports has been for some time past, and is still, pool-. B.I.S.N. steamers leave Bombay for Basra each week (one a fast service and the other a slow service), but while both fast and slow services call invariably at Bahrain and Kuwait, calls at other -ports are very irregular. There is no fixed schedule and calls are dependent on whether or not there is any cargo and the tides. It may happen that no call is made at Dubai and Muscat for instance for as long as 2 months. The B.I.S.N. Company hope to make an improvement in the situation, but the position should be watched, and if necessary the Indian postal authorities might be asked to -press the Steamship Company to make regular calls at all the ports, at least by the slow I steamers. (i v ) Delivery of mail . Letters are delivered immediately after arrival at the Post Office, whatever the hour. As a general rule, however, the inhabitants who are aware that a ship is due, call personally for their mail at the Post Offices where delivery is effected. The position in regard to parcels varies at the different post Offices and is as follows BAKRAIN. When a parcel is received at the Post Office, the addressee is handed a certificate of deliver^ (specimen annexed) which he has to take to + App. B. the Customs Office. The Customs authorities stamp this certificate, and ( n °t copied) the addressee returns with it to the Post Office which then hands the parcel over. The addressee then has to go to the Customs with the parcel for examination of contents and to pay Customs charges, if any. The charges arc collected by the Customs and the Post Office is not drawn into the transaction. ■ A copy of the Parcel Bill relative to each mail is handed by the post Office to the Customs Office for information. KUV/AIT . After the inward parcel bags have been opened in the post Office, delivery receipts are sent to the addressees, and the -parcels are handed to thethe Custoins authorities, together with a copy of the relative parcel Bill. (The Custonis actually call for the parcels at the Post Office,) ihe addressee signs the receipt, and returns same to'post Office which hands him a manuscript note addressed to the Customs asking that the parcel may be delivered. The addressee then collects the parcel from the Customs, paying any necessary duty. MUSCAT . Parcels from India/Pakiston . The Customs Officer calls at Post Office, examines parcels and’assesses charges, if any. Post Office sends addressee a delivery receipt, who signs it and calls at Post Office to take delivery on payment of any charges v/hich are handed over immediately to Customs. Parcels from other places . Same procedure as in case of Bahrain, DUBhl. Copy of relative parcel Bill handed to Customs authorities, parcels are delivered by Post Office to addressees against signature on delivery receipt. post Office sends a notification in manuscript to Customs (through intermediary of addressee) that delivery has been effected, and it is up to the addressee to settle Customs charges, if any, direct with Customs authorities. The number of letters and parcels posted for local delivery is negligible at any of the Agencies. (v) Handling costs of parcels in Persian Gulf po rts. Under present conditions the costs are small. All mails are conveyed from the ships direct to the Post Offices, or are collected from the Post Offices for conveyance to the ships, by B.I.S.N. agents. Such delivery ana collection is covered by the B.I*S,N. contract. The d.I. o.N, agents even arrange without payment for the delivery to the Post Offices at Bahrain and Kuwait of mail from the United Kingdom by Strick Line vessels, ilthough whether they will continue to do this when the British 1 ’ost Office takes over is problematical. If they do not, and there is no reason why they should do so without payment, the costs for conveyance and delivery to the post Office will be fairly high, since in the case of Bahrain the Strick Line vessels anchor about 3 miles off Sitra (south east of Bahrain island) and the mails have to be conveyed by launch to the island and thence by road (some M+ miles) to the Post Office at Manama. Discreet enquiry revealed that the Agents would probably require about 5 rupees per bag for such conveyance. In 'the circumstances, it is suggested that at the outset no change should be made in regard to the existing terminal credits required under Indian regulations, vizt., 8 a.,8 a,, 1 rupee, 1 rupee 8 a. and 2 rupees k- a respectively for 2, 3&gt; 7» and 22 lb. parcels. The matter might, however, be reconsidered later, say after 6 months* working, in the light of the conditions then prevailing.10 . (vi) Sea Costs . The Pakistan authorities have communicated with the Indian postal authorities regarding the credits they will require for the carriage of mail by B.I.S.N. steamers in the Gulf, and are awaiting a reply. ^ (vii) Composition and circulation of mils . The Persian Gulf Offices will require definite instructions on this point. They have no such instructions at present, and are working from memory on instructions laid down in the dim past. Much of what they are now doing is incorrect, both as regards surface and air mails. (viii) Import and Export regulations, etc . &gt;!&lt; * A statement giving this information for each of the Offices App. C. concerned is attached. (ix) Compensation for ordinary parcels . Hitherto, no compensation has been paid for ordinary uninsured parcels posted in the Gulf, due to the fact that registration of parcels generally is obligatory. The United Kingdom procedure should now be introduced, compensation up to the equivalent of £3 being paid for an inland parcel, and up to £1 or £1 12s. (as the case may be according to weight) for an imperial or foreign parcel. (x) Notification of change-over in control to administrations of Postal Union . Such notification, including changes in services, alterations in postage rates, etc., will presumably be done through the medium of the International Bureau at Berne by both the British and India/Pakistan administrations. ( x i) Parcel rates from India end Persian Gulf . The rates as shown in the October, 194-6 edition of the Indian Post Office Guide have been recently increased in many instances, and particulars of the revised rates are shown on the schedul^annexed. ^ App, D. (not copied) AIR MAIL SERVICES The main effect of the change of control will be that communication with India and Pakistan will be international instead of internal. This means that the existing air mail rates from the Persian Gulf to India and Pakistan will have to be increased. An economic rate covering the whole of India/Pakistan, and the use of Indian/Pakistan air services, would be about 6 annas per half-ounce (this is inclusive of, and not additional to, ordinary postage). It might however be practicable to offer a separate air postage rate, say, 3^' annas per half-ounce, for letters addressed to Pakistan not requiring internal air transmission v/ithin Pakistan, e.g., for letters addressed to Karachi; and the Pakistan authorities would like this to be arranged if possible. The air postage rates to other countries v/ill be affected by reason of the fact that the Gulf ports are in a different financial zoneand it seems zone from India for the purpose of air conveyance charges, likely that the air postage rates to countries westwards can be reduced, while the rates for countries eastwards may have to be increased. tf'or example, an air postage rate of 6 annas per half-ounce could perhaps be justified for letters addressed to the United Kingdom (as compared with the existing rate of 12 annas per half-ounce). Air Mail rates for the Western hemisphere generally might be at slightly less rates than those existing at present: possibly the sura of the rates from the Agencies to the United Kingdom and from the United Kingdom to destination. An air letter form at 6 annas might be allowed to any country, including the Western hemisphere. Reports on this subject have already been sent to Headquarters, and the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf and the D.G. of P. &amp; T*, Karachi, have been advised that the whole question of the air postage rates is under consideration by the British post Office and that full details will be forwarded to them as soon as a decision has been reached. I enclose a copy of a report •which I handed on the 14th of November to the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf on the question of the use of the Iraqi air service between Kuwait and Basra for the conveyance of air mail. Inland air services, i.e«, air services between the Agencies. There are at present no recognised official air mail services operating between the various Agencies, but on occasions, vizt,, when sea communications have been very poor, opportunity has been taken by local officials to send mail by R.A.F. services: for example by R.A.F. service between Kuwait and Bahrain which is understood to operate twice a week, and between Dubai and Bahrain. If these services can be used officially for the conveyance of air mail, and there seems to be no reason why they should not, consideration will no doubt be given to the question of introducing an internal air mail postage rate for letters to be conveyed normally by these services, which would afford appreciable acceleration. REMITTANCE SERVICES MONEY ORDERS (Ordinary and Air Mail). 1. Between U.K. and Agencies . There appears to be little demand for the service. A foreign Money Order is rarely issued in the Agencies, and the number paid averages but 2 or 3 a month. It is therefore recommended that the service should not be maintained. The less complicated Postal Order system should suffice. 2. Local service between the Agencies. Very little demand - one or two only issued or paid each month. It is suggested that service should be discontinued. (The postal order system should meet requirements.) 312. 3. Between Agencies and India and/or Pakistan. Considerable use is made of this facility in the direction Agencies to India and/or Pakistan. Over a thousand Money Orders per month are issued at Bahrain, 400 at Kuwait, 60 at Dubai and 100 at Muscat. And * the numbers are tending to increase. In the direction India and/or Pakistan to the Agencies, the facility is not used to any great extent; about 25 a month are paid at Bahrain, and 10, 3&gt; 3? &amp; month respectively at Kuwait, Dubai and Muscat. It seems desirable that the service should be maintained, and as far as possible on existing Indian lines. A description of the existing Indian domestic system has already been supplied to the O.M.B. The method of accounting as between the United Kingdom and India/Pakistan should be on'the following lines:- From the Persian Gulf to India/pakistan. India/pakistan to pay the original orders and to claim tnom + -§70 cashing allowance in the General Account, sending a statement v/ith the paid Orders to .the A.G.D., O.R.B. From India/Pakistan to the Persian Gulf. Gulf Post Ofl’ices to paj - the original Orders issued in India/pakistan and to forward them with the relative Money Order Schedule to the British Superintendent of Posts, Bahrain. After check of the schedu.bes, the Superintendent of Posts would list the Orders in duplicate (say weekly) and send the top copy of the list and paid Orders to India/pakistan with a request that the total amount + cashing allowance should be credited to the United Kingdom in the General Account. The undercopy of the list should be sent to A.G.D., O.R.B. for accounting and record purposes. It is not considered that this work should be delegated to the Sub-Postmaster of Bahrain, at any rate at the outset. He is already working under considerable pressure, and it is very doubtful whether with the calibre of the staff available the work could be done i satisfac torily. 4. Between Agencies and countries other than U.K. and India/pakistan. Very little demand. Foreign Money Orders rarely issued in the Agencies, and the number paid negligible - 2 or 3 a month. Recommend that service should be discontinued. MONEY ORDERS (Telegraph). 5. Between U.K. and Agencies . Very little demand. The service is at present confined to Kuwait only and the number paid or issued averages one or two per month. Recommend that service should not be maintained. 6. Between Agencies and India/Pakistan. The service is not used to a great extent: about 20 a month issued at Bahrain, 10 a month at Kuwait and 20 a month at Muscat. No service atat Dubai. It is thought however that the service may tend to increase, and it is recommended that it should be maintained (on Indian lines so far as x^essible). A description of the existing Indian domestic system has already been supplied to O.M.B. Accounting as between U.K. and India/Pakistan should be on the same lines as in the case of Ordinary Money Orders. 7* Bo twee n Agencies . No demand. Service not to be maintained. Postal Orders. 8. Imperial Postal Order Scheme . The traffic is not large. Numbers sold average 60 a month at Bahrain, 30 at Kuwait, 4 at Dubai and 2 at Muscat. Numbers paid average less than 6 per month at each office. Recommend that service should be maintained, 9. Indian postal Orders . An average of 75 P c r month issued at Bahrain, and 3 a month at Dubai. System has not been made available at Kuwait, or at Muscat presumably because of the few Indians at those places. Number paid at Bahrain negligible - about 2 a month, and at Dubai 20 a ^onth. It is assumed that there will be no question of issuing Indian postal orders in the Agencies; and the Pakistan authorities have indicated that the sending of Indian rupee postal orders to the Agencies will be discontinued. Trade Charge Money Orders. The total number of C.O.D.- packets (letters or parcels) posted at all Agencies averages 5 a month (all destinations inland and foreign), and on these figures no justification can be found for maintaining the service outwards from the Agencies, On the other hand, about 70 C.O.D. items (mainly parcels) are received at Bahrain each month (from all sources), about 15 P e *' month at Kuwait, 9 a month at Dubai, 40 o. month at Muscat. It has not been 'possible to obtain definite information how these figures are split up as between the different countries of despatch, but the great majority seem to originate from India/Pakistan or the U.K. (The U.K. figures can no doubt be obtained, if desired, from the U.K. despatching offices of exchange.) It does seem desirable therefore to allow the service to continue for parcels from India/Faliistan to the Agencies and from U.K. to the .agencies, and because of this, the O.M.B. my wish to allow the facilities outwards from the Agencies to India/Pakistan and to the U.K. despite the small use made, A statement has already been forwarded showing the precise treatment at present in operation as regards Trade Charge Orders in respect of C.O.D. parcels from India/Pakistan for the Agencies, and a similar statement giving details of the procedure adopted in the case of C.O.D. parcels from U.K. to Persian Gulf is being furnished separately. ItIt is not considered that a C.O.D. service should be provided for postal packets other than parcels , and there appears to be no demand for a C.O.D. service of any kind to and from countries other than the U.K. and India/Pakistan. SAVINGS BAM BUSINESS, ETC. It was explained to the Pakistan authorities that the British Post Office was not anxious, at any rate at the outset, to provide facilities of this kind, but was prepared, if desired, to liquidate responsibility of the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department for Indian Savings Bank Accounts and National Savings Certificates. After discussion, it was agreed provisionally that in the circumstances the best solution would be for the inhabitants of the Gulf Agencies to be advised as early as possible that - (i) the Indian P, &amp; T. Dept, was giving up the control of the postal etc. .services in the Persian Gulf on the 31st of March 1948, and that after that date the British pest Office would take over; and (ii) as a result those'persons holding Indian Savings Bank Accounts, National Savings Certificate and other Government securities should take immediate action to close their accounts. Any applications for withdrawal received after the 31st of March 1948 to be passed to the Pakistan Postal authorities at Karachi for settlement.‘ Thus, the British Post Office would be relieved from any responsibility. The withdrawal of these facilities should not involve much hardship; savings could be paid instead into thd local banks. TELEGA, d-HS The position is as follows BiJilbdN Cable and Wireless perform the collection and delivery of telegrams, and the local postal administration handles no telegraph traffic. KUWAIT The telegraph line between Kuwait and Basra is maintained by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department. It is understood that the batteries are maintained in Basra, but maintenance of the line has to be maintained by Kuwait up to a distance of 77 miles to a place called Safwan. Line runs across desert in four distances Kuwait - Jasrah 22 miles Jasrah - Safwan 39 ' Safwan-Znb air-Bas ra 43 A sub-inspector and 2 linemen are stationed at Kuwait. I was advised that the landline was inadequate, in bad condition and requires complete renewal. During interruptions of this landline, traffic between Kuwait and Iraq is normally diverted via Bahrain/Fao - cable.cable. The latter cable is, however, old and always liable to break and during the last few years has been more often down than up. The monthly messages despatched and received over the line amount to about 600 in each direction. There is no inland telegraph system at Kuwait. MUSCAT Cable and Wireless perform the collection and delivery of telegrams, and there is no local telegraph administration. DUBAI There are no telegraph facilities, GWADUR See portion of report on this place. The telegraph situation in the Persian Gulf was fully discussed with the Political Resident (and Cable and Wireless officials), I explained that the Telecommunications Dept,, G.P.O., London, was at present considering the question of developing radiotelephony in the Persian Gulf and that among the proposals was telephony between Kuwait and Iraq for which three alternatives were being considered. They were telephone landline, wireless telephony and a telephone oable, I explained also that the Telecommunications Dept. to await their final consideration of the whole project before commenting on the question of taking over and maintenance of the Kuwait-Basra telegraph line. Mr. Hurding, Officer-in-Charge, C. &amp; W., Kuwait, expressed the view that of the three alternatives mentioned above, C, &amp; W. preferred the wireless telephony as being the least difficult to maintain and/or the less expensive. POSTAGE STAMPS It is understood that British postage stamps overprinted '‘DtHRAIN' and ’’KUWAIT' respectively, and to bear the amounts in local currency, are being provided at the outset in the following denominations •Jd, stamp overprint 1 2 As 1 d. ' tl 1 11 14-cU ' II 'll * 2 11 2d. ' It 2 ti 2i&amp;. ' II it 3d. II 3 ti 6 a. ' II 6 it and that a similar range of British stamps overprinted with anna values, but not bearing the name of the territory, is being provided for use in Muscat, Dubai, and, if necessary, at Gwadur. As already reported, it is considered most desirable that these should be supplemented as early as possible by some overprinted stomps of higher denominations say 1 rupee, 2 iirpees, and 5 or 10 rupees, to meet the postage on parcels and heavy air mail items. WIRELESSWIRELESS LICENCES No licences are at present necessary for receiving sets; and the granting of licences for amateur wireless transmitting sets is contingent on the joint approval of the Political Agent and the Shaikh after the local Service authorities, e,g. the R.A.P*&gt; have been consulted. The Middle East Communication Board are then asked if they have any objection. If they have none, the Government of India have hitherto been asked to allot a call sign. The Political Resident assumes that the British Post Office will deal with the allotment of call signs when they take over. The procedure described above may be held to apply to all the Gulf States except Muscat though it 'has up to date only been followed in Bahrain and Sharjah as no application for a licence has been made in any other State. GWADUR. It was explained to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf that the British Post Office was not anxious to take over any telegraph commitments, and to take over only the Post Office would be most uneconomical. The postal receipts averaged about Rs.80/- a month. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf expressed the opinion that from a general political point of view it would be preferable for H.M. Government to take over postal and telegraph matters in Gwadur, and suggested that Cable and Wireless should be approached with the view of setting up a small wireless station there for communication with India and Muscat. In that event it might be possible also to arrange for' the Company to run the Post Office as a Sub-Post Office of Muscat. I was not able to visit Gwadur and was unable to get any figures of the relative telegraph traffic, but I was later advised by the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi, that the present office does in fact pay its way. The port has very poor communication, ships rarely call, and mails are conveyed by camel once a fortnight to Delhi via Quetta taking a minimum of 13 days in transmission. No air service is available. The existing telegraph 'line Gwaclur-Panjgur appears at present to be in bad condition, but such as it is it is very essential to the native population (about 10-12,000) for trading i^urposes. They deal mainly in the export of fish - and I was advised that if the telegraph line is stopped it would strangle trade and possibly result in the evacuation of the inhabitants to Karachi. The inhabitants had teen pressing for a long time past for better ccmmunication facilities; and there is no doubt that there would be a great uproar if the present facilities were worsened. In the circumstances, I promised the Political Resident that I would communicate the position to ny Headquarters for a decision. I ' alsoalso explained the position to the Director General of posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi last week, and he advised ne that the Pakistan adr.iinistration vd-lu. be prepared to continue the present postal and telegraph arrangements at Gwadur until such time as a decision has been reached. He expressed the view however that so long as the Pakistan administration run the postal and telegraph services at Gwadur, no change should be made in the existing services, conditions and postage rates, i.e. Gwadur should be regarded during this period as part of Pakistan for postal and telegraph purposes. STAFFING, The Offices in the Persian Gulf are at present staffed as follows:- ItiHRAIN (Manama Post Office) Nationality Languages Postmaster Persian Persian, Arabic, Urdu, English Clerk(1) Arab Arabic, English ' (2) Punjabi Urdu, English and little Persian ' (3) ' Arab Arabic and a little English (one clerk short of requirements at time of inspection) 3 postmen locals 1 inferior servant local BiJIRAIN (Muharraq Post Office^ Postmaster Indian Urdu, English Postman local KTOJT Postmaster Punjabi English, Urdu, little Arabic and Persian Clerk (1) Persian English, Persian, Arabic, Urdu ' (2) Indian Urdu, English 3 postmen locals 2 inferior servants locals Sub Inspector Indian English, Arabic, Urdu, Persian 2 linemen locals Dubai Postmaster Pakistan Urdu, English, Arabic, Persian Postman local MUSCAT postmaster « Punjabi English, Urdu, Arabic, little Persian Pos tman local The Political Resident confirmed that he would be responsible for engaging staff for the post Offices in the Persian Gulf; and he stated that he proposed to engage new staff and, if possible, locals on contract termsterciSp say for a period of three years. Those of the present employees who wished to carry on under His Majesty^ Government and who are now employed by the Pakistan/Indian Government on 'pensionable terms would be advised to consider the question of terminating their service with the Pakistan/Indian administration, taking such pension as they may be ^ entitled to, and to enter into a contract, as mentioned above, for service under His Majesty’s Government. In the meantime, present Pakistan/Indian Staff would be retained as already agreed, and if they were willing, on deputation terms. I understood that the political Resident would be communicating shortly with the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi on the subject. The political Resident expressed the view that having regard to existing conditions, the salaries or wages paid to the staff, particularly the lower grade staff, were in some instances inadequate, and he assumes that when engaging new staff, or entering into contracts with present staff, any decision he may reach regarding the salaries or wages to be paid will not be questioned in any way. In this connexion, the question arises v/hether or not in the case of subordinate staff engaged by the Political Resident, their wages will be subject to British Income Tax, It appears likely that persons resident abroad drawing wages that have to be paid by the British tax payer may be subject to British Income Tax, and if such is the case, the x^olitical Resident may wish to take this factor into consideration when assessing wages. Payment of salaries, wages, etc. It was agreed that the salary of the postal Superintendent should be paid by the Political Resident who will need to be advised by the A. G.D. of the actual amount to be paid each month, i.e., after British income tax has been deducted. Wages of subordinate staff, rents for Post Office property, etc., to be paid by the Postal Superintendent. Operation of postal services etc . The Political Resident assumes that the operation of the postal, etc. services in the Persian Gulf Agencies will be matters entirely for the new Postal Superintendent. The latter will, however, be required to refer to’ the political Resident all questions of policy and also to consult him on any important matters. The Political Resident would be prepared, of course, to assist in any case in v/hich the Postal Superintendent needed advice. Supervision of post Office accounts. The political Resident desires that the general supervision of accounts for all Agencies should be undertaken by the Postal Superintendent. The Political Resident would need to be furnished only with a statement each quarter showing briefly the income and expenditure of each of the Agencies. The A.G.D. will no doubt advise as to form in which this statement should be19. be prepared for submission to the Political Resident. Provision of Funds to j-^ost Office. The Political Resident agreed to undertake, subject to necessary authority from His Majesty*s Government, to provide the Postal Superintendent with fundsfor use in connexion with the operation of the postal services should this beccme necessary. Renewal of leases for Post Office premises. This will be undertaken by the Political Resident. Ivil o OELLi J'JEQU S 17ork at Post Offices in Persian Gulf. In general, the staff at the various Post Offices in the Persian Gulf are well occupied, particularly so at the Manama Post Office, Bahrain. There is, however, very little business done at the Muharraq Post Office, Bahrain, the total 'income, nostlyfrcm the sale of stamps, being 12f&gt; rupees a month. This Office was opened in 1946 as an experiment and apart from the sale of stamps receives for posting or delivery about one parcel or registered letter day. The postmaster and postman have very little to do all day, and it is considered that this Office is not warranted. The question of closing down this Office was suggested to the Political Resident, but he was not inclined at the time to give any definite views on the subject. It is suggested that the British Superintendent of Posts should keep an eye on this Office, and that if he also forms the opinion that it is not justified, he should consult the political Resident on the question of closing it down, and perhaps transferring the staff to Manama, which Office is working under extreme -pressure. Quality of staff employed. The staff at each office appeared to be of average intelligence, but did not show any evidence of possessing any high degree of initiative, and I do not think that it would be advisable to make the Bahrain Post Office responsible for maintaining the accounts of the other Post Offices in the Persian Gulf, or to devolve upon that Office any further work as a result of the change-over. The British Superintendent of Posts should take on any work of a general nature, arising from the change-over, at any rate at the outset, and also any correspondence work which might arise in connexion with the Persian Gulf services. Accommodation for British Superintendent of Posts The Political Resident agreed that the British Superintendent of Posts was entitled to free accommodation, and would endeavour to find him such accommodation, as well as a small office, near the Post Office. Personal Clerk for Superintendent of Posts Having regard to the amount of work which will devolve upon the Superintendent of posts, it is considered that lie should have a x^efsonal clerk,20 , clerk, if possible a shorthand-typist and preferably an Indian. The political Resident supports this recommendation, and on the assumption that no objection will be raised will endeavour to engage such an officer. POST OFFICE STORES As a result of the change over in control, British forms and documents will have to be printed in place of the present Pakistan/Indian forms, etc. Steps to this end are presumably being taken, but in view of the short time available, I fear that it may not be practicable to get some of the necessary new forms and documents printed and sent out to the offices concerned in time for the take over. I understand that while all existing stores on hand at the Agencies on the 1st of ^ipril may be taken over by the British Post Office if so desired, the Pakistan administration is reluctant to supply or to loan any further stores after that date because of the paper situation in Pakistan. I gather, however, that in the event of emergency the Pakistan administration will do its utmost to supply at the expense of the British Post Office such forms as may be required, or otherwise endeavour to arrange for such forms to be printed in Pakistan. No guarantee on this point can, however, be given. Specimens of the forms now used in the Persian Gulf are enclosed in the accompanying file. Supply of stores. Stores, except stamps or other valuable articles, should in general be sent direct to the Postmaster at the Agencies concerned. Stamps or other valuable articles should be forwarded to the Political Agent of the territory concerned for distribution to the Postmaster against receipt, as and when required. ?ree clothing for postmen and inferior servants. At present postmen and inferior servants are, in general, supplied with a cheap local dress twice a year for protective clothing. It is reccnnended that this practice should be maintained; the clothing could be purchased locally out of Post Office funds. / Money Order and Parcel Post Agreements. It was suggested to the Pakistan postal authorities that the exchange of money orders and parcels from the Persian.Gulf might be based on the exchange of correspondence rather than official agreements, and while this was agreed provisionally, it was desired that the British Post Office should -write to the Pakistan administration, as well as to the Indian administration, on the subject. POST OFFICE FURNITURE, EQUIPMENT, ETC. It is assumed that all Post Office furniture, equipment, etc. on hand at the Post Offices in the Persian Gulf will be takien over by His Majesty’s Government, indeed it would not be practicable to run the PostM 'App. ,P. (not copied) Apps • G. p # \ Poet Offices otherwise, and it was suggested by the Political Resident that the question of the price should be left over for consideration with the general question of the handing over of political buildings in the Gulf fren the Indian Government to His Majesty’s Government. The 0,1'uB. already has a list of the property and equipment in Post Offices in the Persian Gulf. There are no Post Office buildings or land'belonging to the Indian Postal &amp; Telegraph Dept, in the Gulf except at Gwadur. Minimum and maximum balances held at Post Offices in Persian Gulf. I enclose statements, for the information of the A.G.D., showing the minimum and maximum balances authorised to be held by the various Post Offices, and the system under which remittances have to be exchanged. As already reported, I think it very desirable that the British Postal Superintendent should be sent to the Persian Gulf as early as possible in order to inspect the offices which will be under his control, to see the class of staff employed and to examine their methods of working. He could at the same time keep a watchful eye on the stores situation to ensure that there will be no shortage at the outset. As already indicated, the above recommendations and remarks have been based entirely on my discussions with the Pakistan postal authorities and the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf, and have in general been agreed ije by them. Copies of minutes on the subject which I handed to the Political Resident, and to the Director General of Posts 6c Telegraphs, Karachi, before my departure are attached, together with the reply from the i Political Resident. Colonel Spear, the Director General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi did not give me an official reply, but he authorised me to say that he concurred generally in the recommendations. He stated however that he had to submit the case to Ids Government for approval and that when this was obtained, he would send an official reply to the Postmaster General, London. In conclusion, I would like to add that this, my first visit to the East, proved a most delightful experience, and the warm weather, good feeding and above all the most cordial hospitality bestowed on me by all with whom I came into contact made the tour all the more pleasant. I am very grateful to the Department for giving me this opportunity to see a little of the outside world. ¥. Appleby 23 December, 1947*A' • \ —DEPTL.

You will observe from the contents of my letter No.C/997 dat ed the 5t h October and from my preliminary report of our conversation in my derai-o^ticial letter No.C/999, dated the 6 th October 1947, that the Shaikh has changed his ground since I saw him, and does not now agree to drop his claim to run his own postal administration. He now wishes to raise the question of administration of the post office, as well as that of special stamps for Bahrain, in the 'least possible time*. 4 . I understood, however, that you felt it was unreasonable to expect the Shaikh to relinquish indefinitely his right to administer his own post office and that his agreement to His Majesty’s Government's administering it for the present would suffice. 5 . While I see no objection to the Shaikh's having special stamps for Bahrain, I feel that the standard of efficiency of the Shaikh's internal administration e£=the £ 9 sfc= 0 £££ee=be£ 9 ?e i s at present so low that his assumption of the administration of the Post Office before these standards have been raised very considerably could only result in a marked deterioration in efficiency, if not in a breakdown; and I consider that the 'least possible time* he mentions must extend well into the future. 6 . I am also of the opinion that the Shaikh does not really wish to administer his own Post Office; but has opposed His Majesty's Government's wishes in this matter as a means of expressing his dissatisfaction with our attitude to his claim to Zubarah.

I saw His Highness yesterday morning and he agreed to His Majesty's Government's undertaking, for the future, the postal administration and control in Bahrain and all foreign postal business with Bahrain. He also agreed to His Majesty's Government's using, for the present, British postage stamps overprinted with Indian currency values and surcharged 'Bahrain”. 3. While agreeing not to pursue the question of estab lishing his own postal administration, His Highness wishes to maintain his claim to have special stamps for Bahrain, if possible with his own image on them; and he quoted as examples Ibn Baud's own stamps for Saudi Arabia and King Abdulla's stamps for Transjordan. 4. I said that the issue of special stamps now would be a complication that would mitigate against a smooth change over in the limited amount of time at our disposal, but that there was nothing to prevent his raising the question at a later date. I added that, while I could not commit His Majesty's Government, I was sure that his proposals would be examined with that care and consideration that his proposals, always received. 5. He asked me to write to him on the subject, and said that he would reserve the right to raise the question of special stamps at a later date. 6 .

Strand, W.C.2. 16 OCT 134 ; Dear Ratcliffe Cousins, I enclose, for your inforaation, a copy of an Express Letter No. 2036-41/7 dated 2?th September 1947, from the Political Resident, Persian G-ulf, about the introduction of an air mail service for i ^veit. ~ ' We support the Political Resident’s vie.v that the rapid growth of K«weit, due to oil development, makes the introduction of an air mail service there desirable, and we are anxious to do whatever is possible to arrange this. As I expect you know, the Kuwait Oil Company already employs a large number of Biitish and American operatives and it is certain that this number will be substantially increased in the near future - possibly to as many as 300. So far an the carriage of air-mail isis concerned, it would of course be preferable for this to be handled by a British Company employing British air crews, and before considering whether we should accept the Political Resident's proposal that an air.mail contract might be placed with Iraqi Airways, we should like to know whether it would not be possible a to make ;&gt;v4it a calling place for aircraft. &lt;*f- £he B.O.A.C. service U.K./Bahr£in 4 wnioh is iiuj~bo pi^ovi lie pi— weekly flights, w^s i.ntroduoed primarily to- meet the need for better' air oo.nmuni eat ions bel.veen Oul the.-L ersian Gulf and thfl TI.K., ■■hile-development at Ktjwiit is likely to be on a greater scale than at Bahrain and in consequence tho dooi-raoility of linking 4 *^w Jt fVv. (• /\- i/i-t-cj . KOwait with reg-ular air service^ is^ now clear. Not J a* only would this pemit^air-mail service^ to be introduced on the most satisfactory footing, but it would also give the Oil Company the greatly improved facilities for the number of their personnel which they so much desire It would also do a great deal to enhance our prestige at Kuwait and would be of the greatest assistance to the Political authorities in the Gulf.lor regular calls of B.O.A.C. aircraft at Kuwait would fom a strong inducanent to the Company to accept •I* -I • , „ /k-* C-W%.h'ir4 *U.&lt;W&lt; responsibility for main tain in g ai 3 -i- ^4~r t ires, and it /(».* ~ n- is not unlikely that ; if asked to do so ; they would &lt;*Uo co-operate fully in providing the facilities which would be required for the operation of flying boats in the Kuwait bay. Prom our point of view there would be great tsT l . advantages from an--air oorviee-linki-ig Kuweit with —Bahrgan and. the U.K. and we should therefore be grateful if you would examine the possibility of introducing such a service in the near future. ^ cr 7’'-~i • / ]~ 1- / ,0 o &amp;£&lt;f) H.

Bahrain 27th September, 1947. u&gt;' % ' iff O Postal mails between Kuwait and Basrah are at present transported by car twice weekly in each direction by the Kuwait Zubair transport Company (a Kuwaiti concern) under a contract with the Indian' Postal Administ ration. The charges for the service are Rs. 400 per month and the contract is terminable at four months notice on either side. 2. . Iraqi Airways, who operate thrice weekly between Kuwait and Basrah, have offered to convey mails between Basrah and Kuwait at a rate of 84 gold centimes per kilo. For existing mail load (both air and surface) this would cost the postal administration approximately Rs, 1160 per month as against the payment of Rs. 400 to the Kuwait - Zubair Transport Company for transport of mails by car.A It is estimated that the carriage by air of air mails only!would cost Rs, 200 per month of mails from Kuwait to Basra and Rs, 260 per month from Basra to Kuwait. J 3. The rapid growth of Kuwait due to oil development has created a demand for an improved postal service. The carriage of air mail between Kuwait and Basra by air would be more frequent and much speedier than the existing service by car and the feasibility may be considered prior to the arrival of the G.P.O. expert of terminating the existing mail contract and entering into one with Iraqi Airways as soon as the postal administration of Kuwait is taken over by His Majesty*s Government. Surface mail would then have to be carried by sea but this would not involve much delay as Kuwait is now werved by four mail steamers a month in each direction. 4. To enter into a contract with Iraqi Airways has the disadvantage of entrusting the carriage of airmails between Iraq and Kuwait to a foreign organization, I do not think, however, that there is any strong objection to doing so.

I i September, 1947* I With reference to your letter of t he 3rd of Septemb er about postal arrangements in the Persian Gulf, we agreeT with your view that we could provide a better service at Bahrein than that which would be offered if an independent postal acbninistration were established there, and that it is desirable to discourage the Sheikh from setting up his own postal services. For your convenience I am enclosing a memorandum in duplicate On the points raised in paragraph 3 of your letter, t - - ■ As regards paragraph 7 of Gallows’s letter of the 28th of August we strongly support his view that the introduction of special stamps seems a needless complication; but if further conversations disclose that the Sheikh would agree to accept British P.O, Administration only on condition that we provided specially designed stamps then we should be prepared to consider the matter further. To produce these special stamps would take a considerable time, perhaps 12 months and, as you know, we are proceeding with the overprinting of British stamps so as to be ready with something on the 1st of April 1948, R.J. Hallows, Esq.,, Commonwealth Relations Office. /We : .We are going on with our plans for sending Appleby to Karachi and the Gulf Ports, as we assume you will agree with us that his visit will be essential whatever decision is come to as regards Bahrein. It is however highly desirable that we should know what is to be done at Bahrein well before Appleby *s depart tire which as at present planned will be about October 15. We see from Galloway's letter of the 4th of September that stamps for lose in Muscat will not need to be overprinted 'Muscat'. In the circumstances we shall probably have to provide British stamps overprinted with Indian values and these might also be used in Dubai, thus avoiding an overprint 'Trucial Coast' which as far as we are concerned at the moment, means Dubai only and does not convey much ; I imagine, to aryone not well acquainted with the Persian Gulf area. (I had never heard of it until it was mentioned by Sir Rupert Hay at our meeting). We are considering whether this is free from objection on postal grounds. As regards the provision of specially designed stanps for Kuwait, ny remarks above about Banrein also apply ( to Kuwait but with more force since there is much less postal business done there. We hope that it will be possible to persuade both the Sheikhs to accept the overprinted British stanps which are already in hand. I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to lyman at the Foreign Office, and as you will see from the memorandum copies are also being sent to Kirk. Yours sincerely.« ( &gt; v - L. Memorandum by G.P.O. As regards paragraph 3( a ) of ‘th® Comnonwealth Relations Office letter. Ext. 139VV7 of the 3rd of September 1947&gt; some of the difficulties which the iiahrein Government might he expected to encounter in setting up its own postal services are mentioned below. It is not possible, 1 without more knowledge of local conditions, to go into greater detail or to estimate the extent of the difficulties. Services . Even if there were some curtailment of the elaborate services provided by the Indian Post Office, provision would have to be made for the reception and delivery of postal packets of the various kinds (including parcels) v/ithin the territory, for the exchange of mails containing such packets and parcels- with the outside world, for internal and external remittance services and, possibly, for savings bank business. Counter Work . Besides selling stamps, issuing and paying money orders and undertaking savings transactions ; counter clerks have to accept, or give advice as to the make up and posting of, postal packets of various kinds for an parts of the world. For even the simplest services they must be provided with a considerable number of forms and books for the purpose of accounting, recording and generally facilitat ing the processes of business, and many of the forms must be filled up under their direction by the customers. Some services, particularly the air mail and parcel services of the international post, are highly complicated, and adequate books of reference are required if the customers are to be fully advised and the packets accepted in a fom suitable for smooth transmission to destination by the service for which they are intended. Sorting. Correspondence and parcels are divided into the groups required for local delivery or despatch in inland and overseas mails. Simple sorting may be done by postmen, but for the more complicated processes involved in the despatch and receipt of mails, including the recording and disposal of registered and insured packets, it is usual to employ officers of a rather high^calibre. The sorting clerk, as well as the counter clerk, must have a wide knowledge of postal services, and he has to make use of many forms and books different from those suitable for counter work. Conveyance of mails. In a restricted area this work is usually done by postmen, using vehicles where necessary, or it may be entrusted to contractors. Normal transport facilities are used for conveying mails outside the area. Staffing . Subordinate staff for indoor work should be fairly well educated, well trained and capable of unremitting application to the job in hand. It is gathered that such staff would have to be obtained from outside ; /■outside - probably fran Pakistan* Once the present Indian staff is released there will no doubt be difficulty in obtaining suitable candidates for posts under wither British or local administration* No doubt the Political Resident will be able to say whether the position is likely to be any easier under British than under local administration. A high standard of integrity is required of all employees, indoor or outdoor, who have to handle postal packets and conduct Post Office business. Administration. By British standards the amount of business transacted at Bahrain is not great; nevertheless the multifarious activities involved in the maintenance of a modern postal system would necessitate the whole time employment of at least one high official for administrative work. This official should be a postal expert and it ( seems clear that at the outset a local administration would have to recruit a suitable officer at a high salary from another postal administration. The selected officer wuld no doubt be able to carry on the services on the present basis so long as the interest of India or Pakistan continued, but the overriding supervision of the Pakistan administration would teminate, according to present plans, not later than 1st April, 1948 and the Officer would then have to stand on his own feet. It is most unlikely that the machinery set up by the Indian Post Office could continue indefinitely, or be readily adapted, to serve the purpose of an independent local administration. The officer would therefore have to amend existing rules for the staff and regulations for the public and compile new ones without advice from any higher postal authority. It is probable that he would have to devise a whole range of new forms and introduce new methods to meet the requirements of an autonomous system. These forms, and indeed all the necessary postal stores, e.g. bags, seals, printed rule books and the like, would no doubt have to be provided from outside sources. Arrangements for the exchange of postal packets with overseas countries are in the main covered by the Postal Union Convention, but membership of the Union entails a corsderable amount of correspondence with Union headquarters at Berne on matters of general business and problems which in many cases would not affect Bahrein. Notwithstanding the general application of the Convention to overseas services many matters of detail have to be settled by direct negotiation with individual foreign countries. In short membership of the Postal Union would probably involve an administration of the size of Bahrein in much day to day business which would hamper rather than assist the smooth direction of its(\% i ! b f As an independent postal administration Bahrein would have to deal with administrative correspondence and enquiries from i oreign postal administrations as well as local residents* Xt is doubtful whether tne administrative officer could delegate any of this work to subordinates. Similarly, as the chief representative of an independent administration it would be his responsibility to arrange with shipping companies and air lines for the carriage of mails to other countries, to negotiate contracts or agreements for this purpose and to set up the necessary accounting arrangements. Parcel and Money Order Agreements would also have to be conducted with outside Postal Administrations. It would be his task to negotiate with the staff concerning pay and conditions of service ana this can be a difficult and onerous task even if the number of employees is comparativily small. It is obvious that all this work could be done with much less difficulty by an expert under the direction and guidance ol a large postal administration with separate specialised departments for every branch of its activities than by an expert without such support. The position would clearly be much worse if any attempt were made to run the service without the aid of a foreign expert. u O O As regards paragraph 3 0 3 ) letter, the present position is^that under the Buenos Aires Convention, which remains in force until the 1st of July, 1948 membership of the Universal Postal Union is open to any Sovereign State by adhesion to the convention as prescribed by Article 2, such adhesion to be notified diplomatically to the Government of the Swiss ^ Confederation, and by the latter to the Governments of all the countries of the Union. Article'2 merely states that 'Tout pays est admis en tout temps a adherer a la Convention', but the position is made clear by the following footnote which appears in the second edition of the annotated edition of the Buenos Aires Convention: 'Cependant seuls les Etats souverains ont la faculte' de faire notifier leur adhesion a 1 'Union, sort d'acceder a 1*U.P.U., en qualite'de membre par un alte autonome et unilateral au sows de 1 * art 2 .' As a result the Swiss Government, as is also pointed out in the footnotes to Article 2, has the delicate task of deciding whether a country which wants to adhere fulfills the juridical conditions required of an autonomous member of the U.P.U. Also,seconding to this footnote, tne Swiss Government would, in a doubtful case, consult the members or the Union- After the 1st of July 1948, when the Convention of Baris comes into force, applications - from Sovereign States - for new member ship mil have to obtain the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the existing members 00 be successful. Ther if ■^1 The question whether the status of Bahrein is such as to qualify her fpr mamibership of the U.P.U. as a Sovereign State is one on v/hich the reign Office will wish to advise, and a copy of this memorandum and accompanying letter are being sent to Kirk of the General Department accordingly* It would be consistent with the attitude taken by the U.K. delegation at the Baris Congress to oppose any new adhesions made in advance of the coming into force of the new convention, accept in clearly acceptable cases/already accepted as members of the /&lt;*.* ca^.x^&gt; United Nations* . ■ . .• - If an independent postal system were to be set up in Bahrein without that State becoming a separate member^ of the Union, the international postal service could be carried on within the framework of the Universal Postal Union in one of two ways: - ' •_ • ■ /-, (1) the State could be considered as belonging to the Union under Article 10 of the Conventionjas being subordinate to the Postal Administration of a member of the Union (in this way, Monaco is included in the Union as being subordinate to the Postal Administration of Prance); (2) the State could remain outside the Union, and would in this case carry on its international postal services by virtue of an agreement with some Union country for the exchange of correspondence. (Nepal, which is outside the Union, seems to have had such an agreement with India). Jti*•y. I M* FILE COPY CONFIDENTIAL Wo.1598-S ^ ;NDEXED PERSIAN GTrtJ 1 RESIDfiRCY.

Under my instructions Ranee informed the Shaikh of Bahrain of the impending change in the administration oi the post-office, and of the proposal to introduce in due course British stamps overprinted with Indian currency values surcharged ,, BAHRAIN M . I was subsequently surprised, since neither the Shaikh nor Belgrave has ever said a word to me j on the subject, to receive Ranee’s demi-official letter No. C/8 7 9, dated t he 9th August 1947, (copy, with copy of / its enclosures, attached herewith) reporting the Shaikh’s desire to institute his own postal system. J 3* The postal agreement of 1911 with the Shaikh of / Bahrain precludes him from agreeing to the opening of a post-office in Bahrain by a foreign power but I do not think that it precludes the Shaikh from administering a postal system of his own. The fact that the Government of India on behalf of H.M.G. administered the postal system through the lean years starting in 1884 does not convey any right. I sm disappointed that neither the Shaikh nor Belgrave prepared the ground by previous discussion, but it is a sign of the times showing a desire of the Shaikh of Bahrain to stand on his own feet whenever possible. 4. Bor Bahrain to set up an independent postal system would, I think, be infracticable, and it might be followed by similar requests, e*g» from Kuwait. It seems to me that to enable the Gulf postal system to be maintained the profits of the larger places are required to balance the losses sustained at the smaller places, and that, therefore, the system must be maintained as a whole. 5. That the Bahrain post office is productive of large revenue is borne out by the figures given in paragraph 1 of the enclosure to Bird’s demi-official lette r No .P*7(200 1 - ~Rpn/Afi f dated the 26t h March 1947 to you, and though the 'apparent profit will be reduced wnen proportionate charges for the carriage of sea and air mails are taken into account, in all probability there would remain a useful credit balance. Prom the figures at my disposal, therefore, it will not be possible to infoim the Shaikh that he is mistaken on this po in t. A further impracticability is that it is impossible for Bahrain, with the efficiency of its various Government departments hampered by the over-centralization of all authority in the hands of a single adviser, to administer its own postal system efficiently and there is no course open other than for H.M.G. to run the whole Gulf postal system on behalf of the States. I am not, however, sufficiently infonned of the responsibilities and obligations of postal administrations to enable me to Indicate to the Shaikh in / detail E.P. Do©fcldson Esquire, C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office, King Charles Street, Whitehall, LONDON .detail the practical difficulties that lie in the way of Bahrain f s administering its own system. It is certain that the G.P.O. will he able to furnish some information and I should he glad if details could he conveyed to me with authority to explain the difficulties to the Shaikh and ask him to withdraw his request* 7* The introduction of special stamps seems a needless complication, hut in view of the Shaikh , s desire that Bahrain should have its own I suggest he might, perhaps he met hy the introduction of specially designed stamps for Bahrain. Their introduction may he followed hy a similar request from Kuwait. 8 . I am sending a copy of this letter to Jackson.CONFIDENTIAL '■ .

In view of the difficulty of providing accommodation in Bahrain it would be preferable, if possible, to do without a deputy. At present supervision of the Gulf post offices is carried out by occasional visits of inspecting officers from India. Sufficient local or Indian postal trained office staff (apart from the Residency clerical staff) would have to be provided for the official deputed. (2) Paragraph 4. In order to prevent a breakdown in the postal services it is essential that the successor Government in India should agree to maintain the postal services in the Gulf without interruption after 16th August until His Majesty’s Government are ready to assume control. (3) Paragraph 5(a). No comments. (4) Paragraph 5(b). It would seem preferable for the supply of currency required to be arranged by the postal official deputed drawing bills on the appropriate authority in the United Kingdom. This would render unnecessary the interposition of the Political Resident. (5) I suggest that ordinary United Kingdom postage stamps should be used surcharged 'Kuwait'/'Bahrain”, 'Trucial Coast' (in which Qatar could for this purpose be included) and, provided the Sultan agrees, 'Muscat'. This is similar to the existing system where surcharged Indian postal stamps are used at Kuwait and Bahrain and plain Indian postal stamps at Dubai, Muscat and Gwadur. Sd. A. C.

The.G.P.O, representatives stated that it would be impossible to obtain subordinate staff from this country .and that they would have to be recruited either locally or fron India. Since new staff could not be recruited and trained by April, 1948,it would be necessary to ask the Indian authorities to lend trained staff (presumably on '.foreign service' terns) for a period after 1 st April, 19 ^ 8 .

It was agree d that, the, P.Q. na^ht defer considera tion of the appointment of a British.Deputy Supervisor until it could be examined in the light of experience, say after 6 months. Sir R. Hay suggested that it would probably be possible for a member of his Office to deputise for • / shortshort periods while the Postal Supervisor was on leave or away, so as to keep the machine running. The suggestion was welcomed hy the G-.P.O. ’ w'. I ■ -- 2 . Division of resignsibilities between the Political Resident's Office and that of the Postal Supervisor ... . It was contemplated that the Resident, in addition to recruiting w\ subordinate staff for the postal organisation (see 1 (a) above), should be responsible for the general oyegaeewag of accounts and the.submission of returns to the G-.P.O. in London, and for the provision of funds for the Post Offices, he would also maintain a general responsibility for the efficient running of the postal organisation in the Persian Gulf. ... 9 ^ w Lxq 3. Post age Rates . m*e-£»P«-Qr- -gepreaenfrative explained that at .present the r—’ (l* Rr»^ Gulf Post Offices charged Indian Inland Postal Rates. ‘Sliw would wish to run them on British Ageney-tewaa which would involve alterations to existing • .... • •. * • postal charges. This would mean increased cost of postage from the .Gulf to India . theugh cheaper rates from the Gulf to the U.K. There would be inland rates between the different Gulf Post Offices. The Political Resident did not anticipate apy serious difficulties in\these changes, fhere some advantages. The G.P.O. representatives mentioned that it would be necessary to negotiate a postal agreement (or agreements) with the new Governments in India * I regarding the new arrangements for jana—gc of postal traffic. Special Services . The would be unable, at least for the time being, suoh PAauX* iSiwJt4WWCL- t^ provide any special services /as V.P.^te» or Post Office Savings ' However, it would be willing to liquidate the responsibilities of tbs Indian Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department for Indian Savings Bank Accounts and Indian''National Savings Certificates in accordance.with the agreement!reached between the Government of India and the Treasury. . Twit Ws 5. Postage Stamps . The (NPi'U. proposed to dse/Bticrflsh stamps overprinted with Indian currency values. It was agreed that the single surcharge 'Persian Gulf Agencies' for all the States had some advantages, but separate surcharges (i.e. 'Koweit','Bahrein', 'Trucial Coast' and 'Muscat') might be preferable as occupying less space on the stamps, j Ihe/ Political Resident unclertook to find ^ fj t^ocu ^ . out if the latter suggestion would be acceptable to the variroiwt Rulers conoerned. 6 . Reference was made to the following matters of detail: - (a) Customs Requirements . These would vary with the different Sheikhdoms OuO f*-* concerned. It would be necessary for the G.P.O. to/insert details in their &lt;5||tCA.eX handbook. (b) Forms and Rubber Stamps . The existing ones could be taken over from the Indian Posts &lt;&amp; Telegraphs Department(c) Mail Contract . The G-.P.O, considered it better that the Government of India should maintain a general contract on present lines with the British India (or other) line, and that they should make use of these services by- agreement with the Government of India, rather than that the G-.P#0* should enter into a separate contract with a shipping line, ,, *rb+iJieu*ikoiC (^) Buildings . The Political Resident thought all Post Offices, jaot/tn if lr Li /O rwncut Agency buildings, were rented and he undertook to ensure the renewal of their leases, 1 fU.

Thooo were strictly mattegs-^er-'the locaA govornmontgy 7* Question of what Department snould bear on its Vote any loss arising from running of Persian Gulf postal organisation The G-.P.O. representatives emphasised that the Post Office was run as a business concern. They were only undertaking the running of an organisation in the Persian Gulf because it was a political necessity, and they did not consider it appropriate that ary loss which might arise should be borne on the Post Office Vote. In reply it was pointed out that the indications were that a profit could be made out of the Persian Gulf postal services, but it was agreed that- if a loss arose the point would need consideration. 8 . It was,a greed that it would be necessary for a G.P.O. representative to discuss the questions arising from the transfer with the Indian successor cM'W' ^ ' ‘ authorities as soon as these were known.

The most convenient arrangement would seem to be that a G.P.O. representative should visit India first, tour the Gulf with an Indian postal representative and (if necessary) then return to India to conclude the final negotiations for the transfer of responsibility.

Paragraph 8 of that letter indicated that the various detailed aspects of the transfer would be the subject of further separate correspondence. 2. The whole question was discussed with Hay, during his recent visit to Delhi, and advantage was also taken of the presence of Skrine from Tehran to consider aspects with repercussions on the Persian side of the Gulf, It seems to us that the most convenient method of pursuing the various matters Of detail involved, at this stage of the case, is to send a series of separate notes under the heads Already used in our D.O. letter to Hay of 25th April, 1947 and in Hay's reply - no.921-S of 15th May 1947, copies of which were sent to you.

Owing to oil developments, trade with the Sheikhdoms (particularly Kowcit) was li ccly to expand, ana in consequence tneir postal requirements would naturally also°ba ? f ir ' Q ? ° D ? no °? i:&gt;aa IridL -- v/ere close, and India would therefore ™lf 4 . / r ^ S ' CCa ln tnC maintonari co of an efficient postal service.

It w.as agreed that arrangements should now be put in he.nd for to talce over control of the postal, services from the Indiaon Post Office as soon an this could be arranged. The process however would take time. The best course appeared to be ask the Government of India, to continue to run the services on the present basis , any profits or losses to be carried by them, until were able to take over which should be not later than 1st .^pril, 1948. This seemed preferable to asking the Government of India, during the interim period, to run the services on -an agency ba.sis for H,L,G, (which would involve H.u.G. bearing any losses) since H,i.i,G, were not at present in a position to exercise the necessary financial control. The Government of India might be asked to let the India. Office have as soon as possible certain additional information on the basis of a questionnaiirc which the G.P.O. undertook to provide. The subject might also be discussed in broad outline with the Political Resident, w r ho was expected to arrive in the U,K, on leave in July. It was suggested that it would also bo worth while for the G.P.O. to send a competent- official cut to the Persian Gulf to make a^ preliminary survey of the existing postal set-up. 6. The India Office undertook to draft a letter to the Government of India on the basis of the foregoing conclusions, and to circulate the draft to the interested Departments for their concurrence.

Reference 70145/46 Dear Donaldson* I j tl Weightman who is Just leaving for Paris to attend the Posts! Union Congress has asked me to thank you for your letter of the 25th of April, enclosing your letter of the 10th of April which had been inadvertently sent to the Foreign Secretary of the Government of India. Without committing ourselves in any way at this stage to accepting responsibility for the postd agencies in the Persian Gulf, we agree that the best plan would be to ask the Government of India to continue for the present to run them and that the whole problem should be discussed by representatives of the Treasury, Foreign Office, India Office and Post Office as soon as you can arrange a meeting. I am sending copies of this letter to Gerran and Helsby. i Yours sincerely ^ &lt;4 '‘ ’ E.P. Donaldson, Esq*, C.M.G, INDIA OFFICE.ITEM IV, The three main aspects of the transfer are, as noted, primarily matters for detailed agreement between the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs India and the appro priate department of H.M.G. So far as (b) is concerned I think Indian personnel will have to be employed for some time to come as there is no trained Arab personnel• The demand of the oil companies for educated Arabs makes it very difficult to obtain locals for any kind of clerical employment* As it may be a considerable time before new stamps for the Persian Gulf can be designed and printed I would that when India issues new stamps to mark her indepen dence, stocks of the old stamps should be made over to H.M.G* for use in the Gulf after being suitably surcharged* It is possible that a separate postal administration may have to be set up for the Persian Gulf under this Residency on the lines of a Colonial postal administration but whether this is done or whether the G*P*0* assumes direct control it does not appear that there are any special measures which can or should be taken to safeguard Indian interests, beyond ensuring the continuance of direct mail service by sea and air between India and the Gulf as at present* In this connection I understand that the British India Steam Navigation Company's contract for the carriage of sea-mails between India and the Persian Gulf expires in 1948. It will be necessary to consider at an early date the arrangements to be made for the carriage of surface mail between India and the Gulf when the contract expires*IV. POSTS AND TELEGRAPrIS. The future of the Post and Telegraph organization in the Persian Gulf is under the consideration of the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, and the 3 main aspects of the transfer viz. ? (a) property, including technical and office equipment, furnishings and buildings if any; (b) future of personnel^ (c) technical considerations e.g, stamps, telegraph arrangements etc., are primarily matters for detailed agreement between him and the Post Master General. Any comments which the Political Resident may have, on any of the above three aspects of the problem, will however be welcomed; in particular whether he considers that any measures are. necessary to safeguard Indian interests should the G.P.O. assume direct control as may be expected.^ 1 —— CONFIDENTIAL No. 705 - S. f*) ^ vJSS^ ^ -The Hon’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to E.

I see no political objection personally, and I do not think even the Sultan of Muscat would raise any objection if the position were explained to him, as I do not think the State is in a position to run its own Post Office. The Gulf Sheikhdoms can hardly be -brought under art. b of the Universal Postal Union as it stands unless their x^ost offices are treated as sub-post offices to Aden but they could if necessary be dealt with under Art. 10(a). I was advised-to consult Mr. U.J. Bigg of the Colonial Uifice about the whole question and 1 suggest that 1 should try to fix up an interview with him. The Gulf Post Offices are staffed by the Indian Post &amp; Telegraphs Department and the cnange over vail take a long time to complete. I think the Government of India should be asked to run the post offices as at present at any rate until the future status of India is finally decided. They will probably agree as the post offices are, I believe, a paying proposition. (Sgd.) W.A. Hay. 23 / 10 .^ &lt; kP. At present the G-overrment of India maintains Post Offices in the G-ulf at Bahrein, Kuweit, Dubai and iluscat. I spoke this morning to Mr. D.P. Bell, 0.3. ■0.0, Ox the General Post Office to find out informally what their views were likely to be on Col. Hay's suggestion. Speaking 'of f the record” he said bhe rest Office was unlikely to welcome it as their policy was against the establishment of British Post Giiices abroad of which the only one remaining was that at Tangier. However, as the question would have to be submitted within the Post Office to a high level we should have to approach them officially on the subject. As we have no information about the volume or profitability of the business involved, such as the Post Office would doubtless require, (except for an •arbiter aictum on I. Z ,U1 'i/lft that Bahrein makes a profit of some its. 50,000 per year) ,a draft d.o. letter to the Goverrment of Inula is submitteu asking for suitable figures. allied question will presumably be that of currency. If it is proposed that the rupee should continue to be the medium of exchange in the Gulf, British postage stamps could not be used unsurpassed, but it should be simple enough to over-print them (for example) 'British Post Offices - Persian Gulf', with the appropriate value in rupees or annas.

Please refer to Fowle’s demi-official letter Ko. * dated the 13th July 1935, regarding the opening of a post office at Sharjah. We have consulted the Postal authorities here about the two provisos which the Shaikh of Sharjah has made to tne grant of a rant free house for a poet office* They say that in the event of the proposed office becoming a paying concern the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department would be prepared to pay &amp; reasonable rent for the building out of the surplus revenue. Aa regards the grant of monopoly to Shaikh for the carriage of mails, you will see from paragraph 11 of Powle’s letter of 1st July 1933 that the idea was that the Imperial Airways Agent should do all work in connection with the air and the sea mail, including the conveyance of mails, in return for an allowance of Rs.30/- per mensem. The Postal authorities are therefore not prepared to incur any expenditure in respect of the proposed office beyond Bs.30/- per mensem. *fce should be glad if you would taiwe early steps for the settlement of this long standing; question. It may be impressed on the dhaikh that unless he is prepared to give a guarantee for the security of the Post office and the■ i in mj- the safety of the personnel it is not possible for the Government of India to t^ke any step for the establishment of a post office* Yours sincerely, SdA 0, K* Caroe.

I have not lost sight of the question of the Post Office for Sharjah, hut the question has been held up “by the following circuastances:- 3. The main problem has been to find a suitable house, providing an office room and accommodation for the postmaster, keeping in mind the necessity for security in a place like Sharjah. 4. Two plans were in my mlnd:- (a) To site the Post Office in the Imperial Airways Rest House on the Aerodrome. (b) To find a house close to the Residency Agent’s in the Town. 5. (a) This would give a safe site for the post Office but there is no accommodation available in the Rest House either for the Post Office itself or for quarters for the Postmaster. These would have to be built, and I do not see where the money would come from. The Rest House, too, is 3 miles from the town. (b) The Shaikh has offered a rent free house on the Customs pier. This house is well sited for a Post Office, but as it is some little distance from the Residency Agent’s, it is not too well protected. Further, there are 2 provisos to the grant of this house: O.K.Caroe, asquire.C.l.E., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla.■ w (i) A fair rent to'be paM when the Post Office becomes a paying concern. (11) A nonopoly for the carriage of malls to and from the Post Office by car or launch to be given to the Shaikh. 6. I instructed Cole, who visited Sharjah lately, to ask the Shaikh If he Is willing give a specific guarantee, with security, for the security of the Post Office and safety of the personnel.

Dear Sir, I hope you will not mind if I encroach on your time in order to represent a matter which greatly affects the Naval personnel serving in the Persian Gulf. This station is notably the worst from the point of view of climate and general facilities. Consequently mails are a very important item in our lives. Under existing air mail arrangements we have to despatch our homeward bound letters via either Bahrein or Basrah; all our outcoming letters are delivered at Basrah for subsequent transmission by sea. This, you will readily see, entails a considerable delay. Our ships spend the greater part of their time in the Southern Section of the Persian Gulf, and frequently visit Shargah, and if it were possible to despatch and receive air mails at Shargah a great saving of time could b© effected. This is at present impossible, as there is no post office at Shargah. The technicalitiee of mail arrangements between ImperialImperial Airways and the General Post Office are, of course, unknown to me, and I am therefore unable to put forward any constructive remarks for overcoming the difficulty, but it will be most highly appreciated by the 450 officers and men serving out here under very trying conditions if some means can be devised which will enable them to receive and despatch their air mails via Shargah. Perhaps some similar arrangements could be made as in the case of our ordinary sea route mails, which are posted on board H.M. Ships and placed in sealed bags addressed to the Postmaster General, London, using English stamps. There is a Post Office at Debai - the next state to Shargah - but though ordinary letters can be posted there they will not accept air mails. Under the existing conditions it not infrequently happens that one of our ships has to steam hundreds of miles (e.g. to Bahrein) when it is necessary to despatch urgent official letters by air. I am sure you will readily see what a great difference it would make to be able to receive and despatchdespatch air letters at Shargah. All H.M. Ships concerned were on this station while the air route was being established, and were, and are, instrumental in making its development possible from the standpoint of security. I am.

Sir Samuel Hoare understands that the objections previously seen by the Manager, Imperial Airways, Ltd., at Shargah, to the Imperial Airways Station Superintendent at Shargah undertaking postal work arose from the ^ misapprehension that the Station Superintendent’s duties would involve frequent visits to Shargah village. It appears, however, that this would not in fact be necessary, and it is understood from informal conversation with Imperial Airways Ltd., that if the Government of India would agree to appoint an InMcun clerk to run a ~~ small Post Office at Shargah. Imperial Airv/ays, Ltd. , would see no objection to their Station Superintendent undertaking to supervise the postal work/■ work for an allowance of Rs.30 per mensem, and that they would he prepared to advise the Station Superintendent accordingly. 2.

The position has now advanced to the extent that the Shaikh has given a satisfactory undertaking to protest the Post Office if it is established and is willing to forego rent for the house. He also agrees to provide guards at his own expense. He stipulates, however, that the British India Steam Navigation Company^ Down Slow Mail steamer should call regularly at Shargah. 3. At present the Dp mail steamer calls regularly but the Down mail steamer only calls when inducement offers 4. An enquiry might perhaps be made from the British India Steam Navigation Company as to whether they would agree to make Sharjah a regular port of call on the down voyage.

This Administration has therefore been examining the question of accepting letters in this Administration for Sharjah prepaid with postage at the inland rates and air surcharges at rates applicable to inland air * mail articles (i.e. those intended for transmission by Indian internal air services).

On ISth December I wired the Director of Posts and Telegraphs that I would await the Inspector* s report before taking action on his letter of 3rd December. On the iSth February I wrote to the Director of Posts and Telegraphs informing him that the report was still awaited, and that as the sanction of the Govemn ent of India was necessary before a Post Office could be opened at Shargah he should forward his proposals to me for submission to Government. 6* On the 2&lt;ii&amp; ifarch the Director of Posts and Telegraphs wrote tc me, enclosing a report from the Superintendent of Post Offices, Karachi, and stating 'that it is proposed to open a Post Office at Shargah which will be placed in charge of the Station Superintendent Imperial Airways Limited there who has agreed to work on a consolidated allowance of Bs. 30/- per mensem. It is also proposednygmHil w proposed to attach a gratuity agent to the Shargah Post Office for the conveyance of mails to and from Dubai Post Office on a consolidated allowance of Es. 16/- per mensem, j Hie above arrangements are likely to irprove postal facilities in both the ports to a great extent and I shaxl | be much obliged if you will kindly let me know whether you have any objection to this being done'. 7. I replied to the Director of Posts and Telegraphs that when the two questions of subsidy and surcharge had been settled I would approach Govemirent for sanction for the opening of the Post Office at Shargah. 8. The Shaikh on being approached waived the subsidy. He stated he would like the surcharge but was willing to act on my advice. 9. This led up to my letter of 23rd Hay to Government to v/hich your demi-official is a reply. 10. You will see from the above that it is entirely due to the Indian Postal authorities that the present awkward situation has arisen. I would deprecate most strongly my having to approach the Shaik^ to inform him that he cannot have his Post Office after all, and I don f t see what explanation I could offer him beyond the one that His Majesty’s Government could not afford it ? The idea of a Post Office having been suggested tc the Shaikh he is now very keen on it, and sends me frequent reminders ask ing how the matter is progressing, Shargah is the air port of the Trucial Coast, its Shaikh is the Ruler we should offer most support to, and if his Post Office has to be dropped both his and our prestige will suffer, and our stock along the Trucial Coast, (vide my despatch Ho. 705, dated the 23rd June 1933, to the Government of India)* does not stand particularly high at present. Prom IFrom another point of vie^, too, we should do our best to popularize the **ir Service v/hich we have established along the Arab side of the Gulf against considerable opposition as far as the Trucial Coast section is concerned. \7e want to show not only to the Arabs, but to the world at large, (public opinion is becoming more and more interested in Air matters), that iiir Routes bring amenities - such as a post office - to the local inhabit ants, end it v/ould, in my opinion, be distinctly a retrograde step to go back on one such amenity for the sake of saving Rs. 26/- per mensem. 11. I have, however, a suggestion to offer vhioh will reduce the cost of the Shargah Post Office, i.e., cancel the gratuity agent at Rs. 20/-, vho, it is proposed, should keep up connection with Debai. The Imperial Airways* Agent at Shargah will then act as Postmaster at Rs. 30/- per mensem for Shargah alone, both for the air and sea port - the British India Slow Hail now calls at Shargah as well as at Debai. If later Deb&amp;i wishes to take advantage of the .air Hail the question of a gratuity agent can be gone into with the Shaikh of that place. In addition to the economy effected - Rs. 20/- per mensem - the safety of the agent travelling between Debai and Shargah has to be taken into account: travellers between these places are occasionally held up and robbed by Bedouin.

My -^ear Colonel, v -)3 I Please refer to the cot*responderce ending with (jastrell r s letter to the Director of Posts and telegraphs, Karachi ,IFo 739, dated the 11th April 1S33, ^regarding the opening of a post office at Shargah. I am desired to say that in the opinion o|T the Director- General,, Posts and Telegraphs, the needs of'the Postal Department will be met if the arrangement detailed in the letter from the Director of Posts and telegraphs, Karachi to you, Do. KA-227 dated the 3rd December 1932, is brought into operation. It would cost Es. 20/-. per mensem only. The proposal to open a post office at Shargah was made by the Director of posts and Telegraphs, Karachi, without the previous concurrence of the Director- General, Posts and ■ L elegraphs, and has apparently complicated the situat_j.on. *he proposal is estimated to cost Rs. 46/- per mensem* This means that the opening of a post office would involve an extra expenditure of Es. 26/- per mensem. x he Indian Postal department have no interest to incur this extra expenditure unless the post office isjcomsidered necessary from the political point of view and the -Foreign and Political Department are prepared to provide a guarantee against loss* The present financial position precludes our giving such an undertaking and ordinarily we would have expressed our agreement with the arrangement originally suggested by the Director- General* As however you have already informed the Sheikh of Shargah that it is proposed to open a post office i i cNCLOSU^ ,-the Government of India would be glad to know whether INDIA FOREIGN j Letter Mo can without embarrassment manage to drop the proposal for a u ^ : ^-Mst office and obtain Sheikh t s concurrence in the arrangement i- : ‘'L. 1933 ^ originally proposed.

X presume that sanction has been obtained by the director from the Imperial Airways Company for their Superintendent to act as local Postmaster* The Director also proposes to attach a gratuity agent to the i&gt;hargah Post Of lice lor the com/eyanc of mails to and from Debai Post Office on a consolidated allowance of Ks*16/- per mensem. 3. The ohaikh of Shargah, with whom I have correspon on/(y%) •“S^- on tiie subject, welcomes the establishment of the lost Office, which will benefit both him and his people* he first requested a subsidy in return for his permission to open the lost Office, but subsequently waived this demand on being informed by me that no subsidy will be forthcoming from tue Indian xostal authorities. i'he shaikh likewise requested that the stamps used in the lost Office should be surcharged f Shargah f . h© does not press this point, however, and I think this point mi^ht be left until after the host Office has been established for some time. 4 . I see no objection from the political point of view to the opening of the suggested lost Office, and X venture to suggest that the Government of India mi^lit give permission to the Indian costal authorities for its opening. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, the Air Officer Commanding, •Iraq Command, Bagdad, and to the director of losts and Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle.
