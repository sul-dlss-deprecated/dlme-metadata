Hi.: Majesty's Government have carefully considered the construction of that Conaioion put forward by you in jpur letter of 3rd February to Mr. Parkinson already referred to. That construction is substantially that, so long as the Chief Local Eepresentative is available in Bahrein at all the times required by the Company for communications to the Sheikh through the Political Agent, their obligations under Condition C are fulfilled to the utmost, I am now to say that that construction is one which His Majesty's Government are unable to accept. The Condition is unqualified in its terms and intended to benefit both parties. It clearly requires that the Chief Local Eepresentative shall at all times be available in Bahrein in case the Sheikh or any local authority may wish to discuss/ »E. Ballantyne, Esq., ne Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd., 19, Moorgate, ^ ^ E.C.2.© £ discuss with him, as the Company's Chief Local Representative, through the Political Agent, any matters touching on or arising out of the concession; and the constant presence of a responsible representative with full powers is obviously (apart from any obligation under the Condition) desirable to ensure that all Questions arising between the Company and the local authorities may be promptly dealt with. His fajesty's Government must therefore require that the Chief Local Representative shall in future be ordinarily resident in Bahrein in order to be able to deal with any communication from the' Sheikh, through the Political Agent, or other business in connection with the concession, ana that he shall at all tames be readily available for dealing with any questions that may arise* i*t tne Bame t ime , His xcajesty ' b Government while, under tne terms of tne Condition, they would be entitled to require that the Chief Local Representative shall be permanently resident in Bahrein throughout the year, do not wish to interpret this condition in an unreasonable manner, and recognise that the Chief Local Representative would probably find it desirable to spend a short period out of Bahrein in each year for recreation ana leave of absence, 3. I am to ask that an assurance may be given that arrangements will be made by the Company, in order that this condition of the assignment of the Concession to the Bahrein Petroleum Company may be adequately Implemented in future.

Bear Laithwaite, I do not iurxow whether, in view of the various discussions we have had, you still expect a r eply to your. etter of the 8nd August, (P.2*466u/33) on the subject of the work done 'by the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the question of territorial waters, but perhaps it would be as well that we should put our views on record# First of all, dealing with the Oompany's Report on their operations enclosed with Colonial Office letter of 19th July. There was very little in the shape of drilling obligations contained in the Agreement oi 1925, but such as there are (see Article IV) were complied with# Dhe Report shows in fact that a fairly substantial amount of geological work and drilling has been carried out* The Company sent out a geologist in 1930, and two further geologists in 1938, who made a study of the general geology of the island, and of the available surface exposures of the main island, as well as of the small islands near Bahrein. While the Report does not afford much information as to the probable extent of the oil bearing formations, it indicates that four wells have been drilled (or partly drilled) involving a total drilling footage of nearly 7,000. Two of these wells have produced oil. Number 1 gave an approxiaate production, on a very short test, equivalent to some 538 barrels per day, and Number 2 about 1,500/ '•2* 1,500 'barx els per day at a depth of about 2,000 feet, at which depth drilling has heen stopped for the time beingt These two wells are situated almost in the centre of the island, and ahout 2i miles apart, in a direction from North to South* Hea -^oil was encountered in these two wells at 242 and 660 feet respectively! Wells Numbers 3 and 4 are still 'being drilled# Number 3 is situated to the North East of Number 2, and some heavy oil was encountered at 640 feet» lumber 4 is situated to the South West of Number !♦ When the Report was made, the wells had reached the following depth:- Number 1 2 ,008 feet in 7^ months (approximately) H 2 2,008 n M 4 ,! ( ' ) ' 3 1,650 ' ' 4i w H ) M 4 1,212 w !f l| ' { H ) The site of a fifth well has been located at the North East corner of the island, and provisional work on it begun, and it is stated that the sites of two other wells are under consideration. The Company do not give any indication of the conclusions reached by their geologists, and in the circumstances I think we can hardly press them to do so» It seems clear that the Company, in asking for a further extension of time, would like to be able to,$9mplete some more boreholes before choosing their areas, but we are of opinion that by December next they will have had enough time, and done enough work (judging from the rate of drilling of wells Numbers 2, 3 and 4), to enable them to choose the area to which they are entitled for the purpose of the mining lease* In regard to territorial waters, we can say that there is some justification for excluding them, in view or the terms of the Agreement as to the exploratory period which only allows exploration of the surface of the Sheikh's territories to a depth of 20 feet* The failure to require them to indicate their areas for the prospecting period was unfortunate as this might have settled the question* On the other/V other* iianci# to talce a narrow view of this question may zaean that the area left will consist of comparatively small and widely separated parts of the islands, and the virtual exclusion 01 portions of the territorial waters which could he worked if the adjacent shore was available as a base for operations# If this proved to 'be the case, no other Company might wish to make an offer for a concessi on# We have measured the area of the islands and the territorial waters up to a limit of 1 mile, and the result is as follows Area of Land* Shoal Water Area# S q « miles = Acres* Sq »miles = Acres* Bahrein 210#15 134,496) 74^25 47,521 Sltra 3.85 2,080) Nahbi Salih 0»35 160) 5-85 3,360 8 ,960 Dm i^assam 5,55 3,552 15«70 10,048 ^ 1 ^ 11 0*25 160 4*45 2.848 ^ 1 v • x 1#50 960 11 * 0 7 ' 040 (Pasht al Yanm) TOTALS: : : : 226.20 144,768 105.40 76,417 It is doubtful whether Jadum Island (Pasht al Yarim] is of any value, as a drilling area, being remote from land and surrounded by a large area of shoal water, orfrcnj^dry at low water. total area of these Islands, plus a belt of water 1 mile wide surrounding their land area a 221,185 acres, available for possible drilling® The question of the territorial waters may therefore prove to be an important one. There is nothing to prevent drilling for oil in water, particularly where it is shallow up to a considerable distance from the shore, especially where facilities are available for the construction of piers# We have just seen particulars of a case in California in which a Company have been able to commence a well 2,700/IM 29*700 feet from the shore and 1,800 feet from the end of the nearest pier. In this case the drilling rig is situated on an island of structural steel# This is considered to be an innovation, as hitherto all well locations have 'been reached 'by means of approach piers* The water in this instance is stated to be 40 feet deep» I am senaing copies of this letter to Warner and Moore« Yours, &lt;Scc*, (Sgd.)

CO NFIDENT IAL &gt; Note of an interview vdth Ivir. Baiiantyne of the Bahrein Petroleuin Company, on the 23rd August, 1933. As agreed interdepartmentally I asked Mr* Baiiantyne to come to see me this afternoon to discuss the question of Iviajor Holmes, 2. I apologised to Mr. Baiiantyne for the delay In following up the Colonial Office letter of 28th July on the subject of Major Holmes's recent activities, but said that the whole question had now been carefully considered and a letter had been approved for issue to the Company, we were, however, very anxious to work on friendly terms with the Company, it being to both our interests to do so in so far as we were both concerned with Bali re ln ? and I had therefore been instructed to invite him to call this afternoon in order to give him the general line of the official letter before it issued and '' go emphasise that in despatching it we did so not ixom any .-oouse oi hostility to the Company, out with a -i view to remedying a situation which we felt was in the ® ^ interest of neither oarty. 3* Mr. Baiiantyne expressed his appreciation and I gave him the gist of the draft letter, culminating in the suggestion that Ivkjor Holmes should be replaced, in which event K.M.G, would release the Company from their ooligation to retain him as Chief Local .Representative. Mi 4 ' Baiiantyne then remarked that he realised that aid not welcome Ivkjor Holmes's presence in Bahrein, and felt that the 'decision' (to use his/(v) ~ 2 ~ his own word) which I had intimated to him was not a sudden one, nor would it come altogether as a surprise to the Company. He felt that H.M.G. had for some time heen working up to the position which it represented. The situation was not altogether an easy one. The Company's interests were purely commercial; they were anxious to work with an absence of friction, and it was arguable in addition that it was had for the Company to have as their Chief Local Representative in Bahrein a man with whom these difficulties had arisen and who was serving two other oil interests. This might he particularly the case now that the Company were starting to develop their concession. On the other hand, it might not be easy to dispense with ivRJor Holmes, while his replacement was a really serious difficulty and would require very careful consideration. We would recognise too that the Lhiel Local Representative must be a person satisfactory uo the Company as well a,s to H.M.G. I agreed. Ballantyne said that he would suggest that if this were possible H.M.G. should not now formulate their charges against fejor Holmes. If they did, he thought it would be only equitable that Major Holmes should be given a chance to reply and confront the Sheikh with his (Major Holmes's) version of what had taken place, xLe result of this would be not only an acrimonious argument, which presumably H.M.G. did not want; but that iv&amp;joi nolmes would ultimately be in a position to determine the time table, if it proved possible to take any steps for the replacement of the Chief Local Representative/- 3 - Hepresentative it was probably to the interests both of H.M.G. and of the Company that it should be done with the minimum of friction. On the question of time I would appreciate that if Major Holmes was to be replaced it would not be reasonable to give the Company a time limit of, say, a month in which to do it, or of two, or even of three months. The problem of replacement would be by no means an easy one. He suggested that the best course would be (with a view to giving him an opportunity to communicate with his American principals) that the issue of our letter should be suspended for, say, a fortnight or thereabouts, at the end of which time he would communicate further with me and might be in a position to offer some suggestion. I said that I saw no difficulty in agreeing to this. It was to both our interests to reach a working agreement. On the matter of time, whle we had no desire oo iix a time limit for the Company he would appreciate Uiat i .L the Chief Local Representative was to be replaced, his replacement should not be long delayed, for if it was it woula defeat our whole object. Mr. Ballantyne said he appreciated this and would bear it in mind. ^ O n the question of the replacement of Major Holmes I said that if the Company were disposed to arrange lor uis replacement they would not find us difficult as regards the choice of a successor. We realised their difficulties in filling such a post and they would find Uo v^ry willing to meet them half way. The suggestion ha.a, ind u ed, D^en in I o rmal ly ma d e that ikE J o r Ho Ime s migh t be/8/ (p - 4 - be succeeded hy Mr. skinner, the present Field Ivlanager. I could not say how that would he viewed if it were put up officially, hut thought it not improbable that as a compromise it might meet the case. Mr. Ballantyne objected that Mr., skinner was an ^American. I said that I recognised that that was, of course, the case, and that while there was no specific term in the conditions of assignment requiring the Chief Local Representative to be a British subject we, as he knew, had always attached great importance to the post being held by a British subject. Mr. Ballantyne agreed. If, therefore, Mr. Skinner's name were put forward and were to be accepted by K.M*G. in substitution for Major Holmes, it would probably be with a specific proviso that we considered that the post should ordinarily be filled by a British subject. We should certainly see strong objection to any suggestion to put in an iuneriean of whom we knew nothing. But Mr. skinner, though an American subject, had, we understood, got on very well with the local officials and population and was, therefore, known to us and might be not unacceptable. Mr. Ballantyne took note of this ana, without making any definite statement, gave the impression that the suggestion was one which might form the basis of a compromise. He mentioned that Mr. Skinner was, of course, a technical | expert and not a statesnfen. Moreover he had the disadvantage that lie was Incapable ox telling a lie. I saia that that might not he such a disadvantage from our point of view.- 5 - 8, period of residence of Chief Local Representative . Mr. Ballantyne referred to India Office letter of 31st August, Mo. P.Z.5106/33, on the subject of the period of residence of the Chief Local Representative. He said he could not allow H.M.G. to get away with this construction, and proposed to write in about it. As the result oi conversation it transpired that what Mr. Ballantyne was . afraid of was that H.M.G. would use the fact that Major Holmes had been absent for long periods prior to the date of our letter from his post in Bahrein, as an excuse to determine the assignment of the concession ? on the ground that the Company had failed to comply with its terms. I said that he would observe that, while it would no doubt be open to us to take this line, we had deliberately made no reference to it in our letter and that, speaking for myself, I thought, so long as the Company strictly adhered to the conditions in future (we had nine months* residence in the year in view) H.M.G. would be prepared to let bygones be bygones. If necessary he might v /rite to me and ask for an official confirmation of this. Mr. Ballantyne expressed satisfaction and suggested that the question of tie period of residence might be left to stand over for about, the same period as the question of the replacement of Major Holmes. He did not wish to suggest that the two were linked in any way, but there was a certain relation between the period of residence and the incumbency of the post of Chief Local Representative. I agreed. He added that as regards the specific period, nine months was no doubt a good bargaining figure on which to start. I said our starting figure, was 12 months, as we were advised on the highest legal authority that we could require the Chief Local Representative to spend 12 months of the year in Bahrein.(g) - 6 - He replied that the matter was one on which it was desira'Dle to avoid acrimonious controversy and reach a working arrangement. It could he considered further later. 9. Extension ox ProsDectin^ Licence * Mr* Ballantyne said that he felt sore about the refusal to grant an extension of the prospecting licence. While not a technician himself he thought that the Company had produced sufficient evidence to suggest that an extension . was desiraole. He had not finished with this subject and would have to pursue it further. 10. I said to Mr. Ballantyne that we were puzzled hy the precise meaning of a statement alleged in a recent I telegram from the Persian Gulf to have been made by &amp;jor Holmes to the effect that he had cancelled the offer made in his letter of 15th June and that the Company was not , prepared to make a fresh proposal for the remaining area Busnire telegram of 14th August, 681). On the fact of it tnis appeared to mean that the Company wished to disinterest themselves in the remaining area of Bahrein. Was this the case? Mr. Ballantyne replied that this was not the case; tnat tne Company had impressed on JvBjor Holmes that in the light of the India Office letter of 1st August, No.P.Z.4649/ 3, the Company must start its negotiations afresh and cancel previous offers; but that its headquarters in San 5rancisco had intimated that no offer should now be made in respect of the remaining area until further information was available as to prospects, we were not, hov/ever, to think that the Company no longer wished to consider the remaining area.

Petroleum Department. The meeting first considered the position of Major Holmes and the terms of the comnunication to be made to the Company in continuation of India Office letter of 1st, August, No. P .z. 4649/33. ^ ^ y ^ (V p 2. In the light of the opinion expressed 'oy the ^ / N ' Treasury solicitor in his letter to the India Office of 4th August and of the fact that the Political Agent, Bahrein was understood to spend as a rule 9 months In Bahrein, and the Financial Adviser to the Sheikh, also a European, a longer period annually, it was agreed that H.M.G. could reasonably require the Company to maintain their Chief Local Representative in Bahrein for a period of not less than 9 months in any calendar year. If, as was thought possible, Major Holmes's health was such that it would not be possible for him to comply with this requirement, the difficulties which have arisen in connection with his activities might be solved, since the Company might find It necessary to ask us to agree to a substitute. meeting then discussed the line to be taken with the Company on the question of the recent activities of the Chief/6V - 2 - Chief Local Hepresentative. It was agreed, in the light of the opinions expressed by the Treasury solicitor and by the S / X . . _ # .... Legal Adviser at the India Oifice, that there was notmng m Condition C scheduled to the Indenture of 12th June 1950 which would entitle E.M.G. to demand IK J or Holmes's dismissal, he being exclusively a servant of the Company; and that since H.M.G, had approved the appointment of Major Holmes they had no further say under the terms of Condition C, (though they had of course the right to insist- that the Company saw to it that the terns of that Condition were observed by Ivlajor Holmes) except that their consent would be necessary under the terns of the Condition before the Company could determine his appointment. They would thus have to rely on being able to convince the Company that in the interests of the Company as well as those of H.M.G., it was desirable that Major Holmes should be replaced. The meeting also considered the possibility of advising the Sheikh of Bahrein to exclude Major Holmes from his territories, in view of his misrepresentations of His Excellency's attitude, but decided that the political and other objections to this course were so strong that it should not be considered save in the last resort. 4. After exhaustive discussion the conclusion was reached that the best course would be, without requiring Major Holmes's dismissal, to indicate to the Company the circumstances in which he had been appointed; the fact that the basis of discussion haa at the time been that the Chief Local Representative should be persona grata, to H.M.G. as well as to the Company, in the interests of both parties; to add that the latest developments made it impossible for H.M.G. any longer to regard him as a satisfactory channel of communication or a satisfactory incumbent of the post; and to/| / /»A ^ \ L y i 5f\ 1% V - 3 - to suggest that the only satisfactory solution in their view in the interests hoth of the Company ana of H.M.G. would he 1 ^ that he should now he replaced. In the event of trie Company responding, H.M.G. on their part would he prepared to release the Company from their oh ligation to retain Iviajor Holmes under the terms of Condition C. It was agreed that a draft to the Company- should he circulated for concurrence. ^ / / 5. It was further agreed that if&amp;nd when approval was obtained to action on these lines it would he well that the India Office should see Mr. Ballantyne infornally before any letter actually issued, ana indicate to him the course of action which H.M.G, had in mind, emphasising that this was not an indication of hostility tov/ards the Company, hut that the course proposed was one which appeared to he in the hast interests of hoth parties and, (if the conversation justified this) that H.M.G. would not he found difficult in regard to the replacement of Major Holmes and might be prepared to consider as a special case Mr. Skinner, of whom they had now considerable experience. 6. It was recognised that if Major Holmes lost the post of Chief Local Representative, but was not excluded from Bahrein and Koweit, he would still be free to pursue his activities in those and other Sheikhdoms of the Gulf as a private individual or as the unofficial representative of oil interests, but Colonel Fowle had at an earlier stage been of opinion that the blow to his prestige involved in his loss of the post of Chief Local Representative would be such as prejudicially to affect his position in the eyes of the local rulers concerned. &lt; ^• The Company's a'PDlication for extension of the ProF,nar.t.1ng 11 r.enr.fl . The meeting read tile three letters ^ V -aateci 9th August from Mr. Ballantyne to the India Office, y tkif .2.4877-4879), of which copies had been circulated, and also Mr./- 4 - Mr. Laitiiwaite^ letter (P.Z.4750/33) of 8th August to Mr. Starling recounting a previous conversation with Mr. Ballantyne on the same subject. It appeared that the Company had instructed Major Holmes on 9th August to press forward immediately the application which he had made on theii behalf on 4th April 1933 for one year's extension, to 8-12.34;, of the prospecting licence. That application had been accompanied by an alternative proposal that the maximum aggregate area to be covered by the Company f s mining lease should be increased from 100,000 acres to 200,000 acres, and that the prospecting licence should be extended to 2nd ApMI 1935. The effect of Ivjajor Holmes's application of April 1933 had thus been to entangle the two oiuestions of the extension of the area to be covered by the Company's operations end of the extension of the Company's prospecting licence. From the instructions which the Company had sent to Major Holmes .on 9th August it appeared that their intention now was again to separate the two questions and deal with them independently. 8. The meeting in the first place considered whether the Company could demand as of right a further extension of the prospecting licence. It was agreed, in the light of Sir Maurice Gwyer*s opinion of 18th May, that the answer was in the negative, and that the decision must' rest with the Sheikh on an examination of the merits of the case. The Petroleum Department expressed the view that with what had already been done and what could be done by December 1933, the Company should be in a position to reach a definite opinion on tiie area. The Sheikh would therefore be Justified in refusing any further extension and in claiming that they must select an aggregate area not exceeding 100,000 acres uader tneir mining lease on the expiry of the existing extension of tie prospecting licence- It was suggested that the Company/- D. - Company might threaten in reply to abandon the concession, ^'but Mr. Starling thought it most unlikely that they would do so ana that if they shoula, there would be no difiiculty in getting another Company to take up the concession. In his viev the Company clearly attached great importance to the possibilities of Bahrein. 9. Further investigation showed that the refusal of an extension of the prospecting licence would apparently be definitely in tne Sheikh's interest. In the first place, the AtP»O.G. had now indicated that they would be unable to make a firm offer for the balance of the islands until the precise area involved was known. This information would not be available until the Bahrein Petroleum Company had taken up their mining lease. Secondly, a further extension might enable the Company to secure information of such a nature that they would have no longer any interest in acquiring a lease for the balance of the islands, while the A.P*O.G. might decide, in view of the delay involved, to drop out altogether. Thirdly, refusal of an extension v/ould make it possible for the sheikh to indicate his readiness to entertain offers in respect of the balance of the islands, probably towards the end of this year, once the Company had taken out a mining iease ana selected their areas. With a definite area in issue better offers might conceivably be expected from the competing interests. Fourthly, (on the assumption already jmde that the Company would proceed to take out a mining lease), the effect of refusal would be to secure at an earlier date than otherwise probable increased royalties for the Sheikh under the mining lease. On the other hand, the difficulty in securing Edifications of the mining lease might be greater if we refused/- 6 - refused to meet the Company over the extension of the prospecting licence. The force of this argument was admitted. On the other hand, Sir Maurice Gwyer's opinion made it clear that we could not demand such modifications as a condition of an extension of the prospecting licence. We should in any event to a large extent he dependent for them on the goodwill of the Company, although as had heen pointed out at previous conferences, this matter had already foimed the subject of correspondence with the Company, and H.M.G. had indicated that in return for concessions already granted to the Company they had certain alterations to suggest in the mining lease*. It was agreed that, although there might he some difficulty on this aspect of the question, H.M.G. would not he justified in advising the Sheikh to extend the prospecting licence merely on the chance that as a result the Company might he better disposed towards accepting certain amendments in the mining lease (see in this connection paragraphs 11 and 12 below). It was agreed that the political Resident should immediately be consulted on the position generally by cable (see telegram ^ from Secretary of State for India to political Resident, y No•2000 of 11th August 1933). 11• position of territorial waters under the 1925 Concession ■ Heference was made to the correspondence which had passed between the India Office and the Petroleum Department V &gt; aC) (Mr. Laithwaite to Mr. Starling, dated 2nd August, P*z.4660/ , U ^3, paragraphs 4 and 5, -and 9th August, P.Z*.4857/33) • The l-egal Adviser at the India Office, tO' whom the question had been referred, had expressed the opinion that, although the matter might not be free from doubt, he would himself hold that 'the whole of the territories under his control' (Article 1 of Concession of 1925) and 'all parts of the territory/■territory unaer tiie control of the Sneikh' (First Schedule Clause 1) were comprehensive enough to include territory lying helow the Sheikh r s territorial vaters. On the other hand the meeting, while admitting that this was the case, was disposed to think that in the light of the correspondence which had passed in regard to an extension of the concession, the iU'nerican interests were hy no means sure of their position as regards territorial waters under the 1925 Concession. If this was the case, it might he possible, by agreeing to include territorial waters in the area under the prospecting licence, to make them more amenable as regards our modifications in the mining lease. 13. Amendments in the mining lease . The Petroleum Department reported that they were continuing their examination of this point in the light of the material which had been supplied by the interested Departments of H.iVLG. INDIA OFFICE. 25th August 1933.P.Z.5317/33. 3^ nDN F IDENT IaL ♦ Note of conversation with ivir. Ballantvne o n 25t]i'~Au^ust 1955 . Mr. Ballantyne rang me up to-day and asked for an interview. On arrival he intimated that the Company, on a consideration of the position as a whole in the light of our conversation on 23rd August, and after consultation hoth with the Eastern and General syndicate and with San Francisco, had decided to replace Major Holmes straight away. Intimation of his replacement would go to him hy this week's air mail. He would he temporarily succeeded by Mr. skinner. The question whether Mr.skinner should be proposed as the permanent Representative was under reference to San Francisco and there might he some delay in reaching a decision on this point. Mr. Ballantyre desired to suggest informally on behalf of the Company that, in the interests (as he phrased it) of giving a kicking horse room to kick, and in view of the fact that Major Holmes was likely to take their decision exceedingly badly, we should hint to the political authorities in Bahrein that it might be desirable to avoid him until the contents of the air mail had had time oo subside. He was likely otherwise, they thought, possibly to create a scene and certainly to make Accusations against British officials, etc. in a manner which might be very embarrassing. Mr. Ballantyne added that the Eastern and General syndicate, who, in a discussion yesterday, had agreed to Major Holmes's dismissal and had undertaken to confirm this in writing, had, in fact, confirmed it in a very weak letter, copy of which had apparently gone to Major Holmes, suggesting that the Company might find some appointment for him locally in the Gulf. The Company were not prepared to do this.2. Mr. Ballantyne added that in the interests of making a clean hreak with IvB.jor Holmes the Company did not propose for the moment to renew their application for an extension of the prospecting licence. We were not to imagine that they would not renew it once Major Holmes had handed over, hut he desired to make clear their reasons for postponement. 3. I said that I was sure that the decision of the Company would be much appreciated by H.M.G. and that I thought it was a wise one from all points of view. It was quite clear that the existing situation was unsatisfactory and In the interest of neither party. INDIA OFFICE. 25th August 1933 J.G.

To:- The Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Sir I hare the honour t^ refer to Paragraph Ho:4 of your Confidential despatch No:1114~S dated the 26th August 1933 to His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India, During my interview on the 21st August 1933 Mr .Belgrave and I explained to His Excellency the Ruler the source of the misunderstanding in his mind regarding the area of Bahrain. 3« His Excellency had 'been under the very firm impression that 100,000 acres represented 'half' the main Island. 4 # It was explained to His Excellency that on the 23rd April 1928 Major Holmes applied on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited for an oil concession covering the remaining portion of the whole of the Bahrain Group of Islands not alienated under the Bahrain Concession Agreement of 2nd December 1925 and their Territorial Waters (Bahrain Endorsement Ho:C/149 of the 3rd May 1929 to the Secretary to the Political Resident)• In this application (which was not granted) the balance of the total area was shown as 97,920 acres# 5. That this area approximately doubled the 100,000 acres mentioned in the Concession of 1925 and thatcertain calculations as to Royalties were based on this fact, was undoubtedly the reason for His Excellency's erroneous impression. 6. The figures in the Statement now supplied by Major Holmes (and forwarded to you under Printed Letter No:C/346 dated the 19th August 1933) were also explained and His Excellency eventually appeared to grasp the real position and to realise that he had not lost' any territory. His brother,Shaikh Abdullah,informed the Adviser and myself that he had never had any fears on this score. 7. I regret that the report of the satisfactory termination of this misunderstanding was inadvertently omitted from my Confidential despatch lTo:C/370-10/l.IV of the 23rd August 1933. f SSI I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Agent Bahrain.CONFIDENTIAL. 41 -iX' -L No. 1187-S of 1933c f) 4 The Hon ble the Political Resident in the Persian Grulf presents his com pliments to 1, His Majesty's Secretary of Btate for India, London. 2» 'The '^orei pn.

They also feel that the American Oil concerns have been getting too powerful and with too great a hold in the Gulf and Hasa, and,therefore ,the British are determined to get a British Company in Bahrain,where it will be possible to compete with the Americans and oust them eventually. 6, The Ruler has plaintively asked Belgrave 'Why should Major Holmes be changed?*. * Was an Englishman to relieve him?*. 'Was his successor liable to be changed at the Company^ will without reference to him?*. 57. Shaikh Hajmad feels that all sorts of things affecting him have 'been happening ajid going on oyer his head and that he has not had anything explained to hinu He cannot believe that his letter complaining of Major Holmes , misrepresentationis can be the cause of all this upsets The letter was not meant to have any such effect and was merely a part of the 'bargainings 8, The Shaikh has even 'been discussing the matter with his wife,Aiyesha,who in conversation with Mrs.Belgrave showed that she knew all about the affair. 9^ The Shaikh,who,as I said above,has a great personal affection for Major Holmes,would hate to have Ji/lajor Holmes leave Bahrain in disgrace after so many years work in this place, 10, Probably on account of this anxiety he has gone out to JAU at the other end of the Island for an indefinite period, 11, The Shaikh and his brothers are dead against having anyone but an Englishman as Chief Local Representative,as they do not feel that they could work with hime These sentiments i \ have been expressed by the Shaikh in his letter of the 14th : \ Jamad-i-Awwal 1352 (4th September 1953) sent you with my despatch No:C/399-10/UIV dated the 6th September 1933, lowv rco - - ■ Y' 5 ' 12, Belgrave,of course,who hears their story in great - detail,impresses on me their genuine distress® He,himself,is f in a position of great difficulty as it often hoppono is impossible for him to explain to them the true aspects of the case as far as they are known to him, 13, The Shaikhs think that the Americans are behind it all and are wondering what answer the British Government is going to give I ^ Hon'ble Lieut-Col.Gordon Loch,I.A, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Copy of Message.

I have - since my return to Bahrain (on August the 3rd 1935) - examined ®y notes of the disciissions and have gone closely into other phases of iry talks with His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain. I certainly /cannot agree that the statements I made in my letter of May the 17th 1933 are inaccurate,except - in so much - that I omitted to mention in my letter that in addition to my interview with His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain at Saidiir, several meetings all of which were by appointment made on behalf of the Shaikh of Bahrain - took place later at the Bahrain Govern ment Offices,at which meetings the following were present} His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain, Shaikh Abdullah,Shaikh Sulaiman and the financial Adviser to tne Baarain Government 3. with regard to the question of the Territorial waters. Territorial Waters have always been included as part of the Territory applied for as tne ^Area Hemaxning or iktLditional Area' of Bahrain Islands. This may be verified by referring to the original application for the Area Remaining - apart from the 100,000 acres covered by the Concession Agreement dated the 2nd December 1925. I enclose a copy of this original application to deal for the Remaining Area (dated 23-4-1928) and the Political Agents reply (dated 3-5-1928). The Area Remaining (apart from the 100,000 acres) was mentioned as a whole,neither the Territorial Waters nor the Dry Land were discussed specifically. In conformance with the original application the designation 'Remaining or Additional Area' is taken as including both the Pry Land and the tidal and Territorial waters. The total Dry Land of the Bahrain Territory (apart from the 100,000 acres) remaining is roughly 47,600 acres,the area applied for as Additional Area or Remaining Area totalled roughly 98,000 acres,the difference - 50,500 acres - between these two areas being made up of those areas subject to tids .1 influence and the shallower parts of the Territorial Waters. 1 know that there was - until very recently - considerable confusion in the mind of Eis Excellency the Shaikh of^ Bahrain as to what areas were actually comprised within the term 'Remaining Area'. It was to clear up this point with the Shaikh that the meeting for August the i9th 1933 'was arranged,but as this meeting was cancelled by the Political Agent,the confusion may still remain. ihen I last spoke to the Shaikh on this question,he was under the impression that the Concession of 2-12-1925 embraced one half of the (Dry Land) area of his Dominions and that the 98,000 (approx) was also all Dry Land,but this is not so. The 98,000 acres comes into the question as that was the area applied for in the first Draft Concession covering tne Hemaining Area.(OP % 4, Aft regards tiie loan mentioned in Par&amp;graj^i 2 of my letter I pointed out at tim mectlage that stringeat terms axad conditione aa ^afe^uarde ^ ould imve to be imposed against the possibility of o&amp;anged conditions,seeing that tJUis loan was to be made as far aiiead as 20 months JTrom the effeotive date ot Urn Agreement and much might happen in the meantime both in the Oil market and in the deirelopment work of the Oil Fields of Bahrain, this condition was reco^ised as reasonable. The world price of Oil was naturally one of the «&amp;fe guards. a. in respect of the charge that Condition , C f was violated this charge smy be technically correct. Xhe condition that led up to the violation may be worth mentioning. Between the arrival in ^aroh of Messrs Janson and Lomoardi and the middle of August quite a number of meetings % oqk place between His £juseU.enc?' the ^haiida of Bahrain ana me* Most of these meetings were official appointments made for His l-aofcllency the Shai&amp;h of Bahrain* tm first appointment was made on March tiie 8th 1935 and the raost recent on august the 19th 1953 the latter interview however did not take place.

X considered these appointments I as x.entioned equivalent to a cox^mnd of His i&amp;ccellencj the I Shaikh, and by keeping them X did not realise that I was 1 violating Condition ♦0*. It seemed so unlikely that the 4 Political A^ent was not aware of the above meetings taking place from time to time that I failed to recognise the necessity of notifying them officially* How that it is doubtful that the Political Agent »as aware of these interviews I can only admit that I was in error and express regret that the breach of Condition *0* occurred.

Dear Mr. Ballantyne, In the course of our talk triis morning you asked whether, should the Company desire, to adopt this course, it would he possible for a meeting to be arranged between the Petroleum Department end a technical representative of the Company to discuss the technical aspects of the question whether by December next the Bahrein Petroleum Company would have had enough time and done enough work to make it possible for them to choose the area to which they are entitled for the purpose of the mining lease. 2. I now write to say that the Petroleum Department will be very glad to see a technical representative of the Company and discuss the matter with him if the Company so desire. They point out, however,(and we should like to associate ourselves with this) that the matter, as you will appreciate, is one of much urgency and that it would be desirable that any discussion should, if possible, take place in the immediate future. 3/ •Ballantyne, Esq., sanrein Petroleum Company, 19, Moorgate, E.C. 3.i 3. perhaps you would loe so good as to let me know the wishes of the Company in the matter.

BALLiNTYNE OF TriE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPi^NY, Mr. Ball&amp;oityne had asked Tor an interview in r order to discuss the (Question of the extension of the Bahrein Petroleuiri Company's prospecting licence. 3. The position of Mai or Holmes * At the outset Mr. Ballantyne confirmed that Major Holmes had now handed - over and was leaving Bahrein to-day. He/was anxious to know whether H.M.G. wished to persist in their charges against him. I saia that I thought we should he quite satisfied to let this matter drop in view of subsequent developments. Mr. Ballantyne expressed satisfaction and added that in the interest of preventing any future misunderstanding he was anxious to make it clear that Major Holmes had now ceased to have any connection with the Bahrein Petroleum Company and was no longer their Chief Local Representative; that at the same time he understood that he was still in the employment of the Standard Oil Company, and the Bahrein Company were also under the i impression, as the result of statements 'by him, that he I | had been and might still be engaged on private business by | various Sheikhs in the Gulf, including the Sheikh of I 1 Bahrein. It was possible in these circumstances that he Might at some time in the future find himself again in Bahrein and possibly using the name of the Standard Oil Company. Mr. Ballantyne hoped on behalf of the Bahrein Petroleum Company that we would not misinterpret any such v isits by Major Holmes ana would accept the Bahrein Company' assurance that so far as they were concerned his i'Qsponsibilities in Bahrein were at an end, I said we Q-Ppreciated the position. Extensiori , of the orosnectin^ licence . Mr. Ballantyne then raised the question of the extension of/2 of the prospecting licence* The Company re ma In eel 01 opinion 'ulicit they were entitleo. uo b , lur uiiu x extent ion and felt,that such an extension would ce necessary before they could de entirely satiisiied as to uie oil position in Bahrein* There was nothing in the ^^n0iKh b xCply jo mow why the extension had heen refused. The Compaay were in a position of some difficulty: they did not wish to ask the sheikh (through Mr. Skinner) for his reasons, for fear of receiving a snuh, and equally they thought that a request for those reasons submitted through the India Office might offend the Sheikh's amour propre. frankly inform Mr.. Ballantyne of the position. Tne information supplied oy the Company had been very carefully considered oy tne technical adviseiD 01 il , who in the light of their investigations had advised that 'by December next the Company would have had enough time and done enough work to enable them to choose the area „ + , ; to which they were entitled for the purpose 01 tne mmuig lease. On a point to which Mr. Ballantyne nad referred, I understood that there was nothing unusual in striking water in operations such as they were at presenu cailying on, and in the view of the petroleum Department the Company were indeed lucky to nave struct oil in all tlioix bore-holes. Ke would not, moreover, overlook uhao one Company and their predecessors had now had 8 years from 1925 in which to make the necessary investigations in Bahrein. 5, There was a different aspect 01 the matter, viz. the financial aspect,of tne grant of a furuner extension by ttie sheikh. The Sheikh, as Ivii • Italianuyne was piooaoly aware, was very short of money and financial considerations must weigh very considerably with him. To grant a j.urther I -said that I saw no reason why 1 should not extensior(V°) - 3 - Oil extension (for which, on the advice summarised In the preceding paragraph,there was no Justification) would mean a further postponement of the receipt oy him of increased royalties, etc. under the mining lease► Further, as Mr. Ballantyne was no douot aware, 'the A.P.O.G. had now applied for a concession in respect of the balance of the islands- The SneiKh ooviously could not proceed with this application until he knew what area was available and that he would not know until the B.P.C. had taken out- their mining lease. The grant of a further extension to them would therefore not merely have the effect of postponing his increased receipts under the B„P.C. f s mining lease, hut also of postponing any receipts (whether from the B.P.C. if tiiey were interested in the area, or from the A.P.O.C.) in respect of the remaining area of the islands. 6. On the question of the right of the Company to an extension, we were advised on the highest legal authority that they were not so entitled, ana the Sheikh, in acting as he had acted, was acting within nis legal rights. 7. Mr. Ballantyne expressed appreciation of this explanation of the position and said that he would iniorn his Principals in San Francisco without delay. He wished to remind me that at an earlier stage this summer he and Mr. Lorrioardi had informed the Colonial Office that the Company regarded the extension as one to which they were entitled and were not prepared to make any additional payment in--' order to secure it. He recognised at the same time the Sheikh 's financial difficulties and the lorce of the financial arguments. Moreover, if the A.P»0#C. were interested in the 'balance of the islands, iu was clearly no longer oossible, as the Company had at one uime intended; to deal with the extension of the licence and the extension of/of the area simultaneously and sweeten the Sheikh hy giving ^irn a lump sum to he repaid from royalties» His Company might, he thought, in the altered circumstances he prepared to reconsider the question of some payment in return for a concession, hut he could not, of course, cormiit them on this. Speaking personally, he would prefer in the circumstances to abandon the idea of a further extension and take out the mining lease next December. The Company had already made arrangements (in case they should he forced to take out the mining lease) to stake out areas and could prohahly take out the mining lease without delay. It looked now as though Bahrein was likely to he a less profitable proposition from the oil standpoint then had at one time heen anticipated, and apart from that there was little doubt that the Company were on the right siae of the oil hearing structure. 8. After some further discussion Mr. Ballantyne enquired whether we would see any object ion to allowing (if the Company desired this) a technical expert representing them to discuss with the Petroleum Department the technical aspects of the question with a view possibly to convincing our technical advisers that there was some technical oasis Company's for the / claim for a further extension. He mentioned in this connection that under 'western practice' tne Company considered that they could not reasonably be required to take out a mining lease until they were more satisfied than they were at present as to the position of the Bahrein oil structure. I said I would consult the Petroleum Department on 'ttiis. Mr. Ballantyne was not quite sure whom the Company would, nominate for the purpose. Mr. Hamilton would be a Possibility: alternatively they might send a man specially America. I impressed on him the Importance of urgency, ^ich he appreciates. (I have since consulted Mr. Starling and/- 5 - C m I and with his concurrence have informed Mr. Bailantyne that the Petroleum Department will be glad to discuss the natter, but that as it is one of now great urgency any discussion should 'be in trie immediate future). 9, Amendments in the minings lease . The conversation did not justify a suggestion being made to Mr. Bailantyne that the acceptance of our mining lease amendments might form part of a Quid pro quo for the extension of the prospecting licence, but a casual remark on his part made it possible to raise the question generally. Arising out of it I mentioned that, as he was aware, we had a number of amendments to propose in the mining lease, one of which was not unlikely to be some moalf ication of the arrangement under which the minimum royalty of Rs.30,000 might not become payable for a minimum of 5 years. Mr* Bailantyne said that he desired again to make the position of the Company in this matter clear. They regarded their hands as quite free as regards the mining lease. Any alterations must be the subject of negotiation. I said we appreciated this. On the other hand we felt that we had treated trie Company with considerable generosity in the past and had met them on a variety of points. We expected that they would be accommodating on their side in the matter of these amendments, the amendments were- of two types - the first those which had for practical purposes already been Agreed with the Company, viz. the consequential amendment about oil production following on the amendment on that Point made in the prospecting licence, and the amendments In regard to the maintenance of a Chief Local Representative, etc. which arose from the assignment of the Eastern and General Syndicate's concession on 12th June 1930. The second category were rather different in character. I could not give him6 - full particulars of them at the moment. The majority were, lr x tnought ? directed 'to Drinking tiie in in in g lease in 'to clossr conformity with ordinary oil field practice, out there would probably be some of rather greater importance. • Baiiantyne said that clearly there was no difficulty aboiio the first category. As regards the second, |he had asked the Colonial Office so long ago as February for j a complete list of the amendments we desired in the mining | i6cise, so that it could oe considered without delay, whether or not a further extension was granted by the Sheikh. They had never received ^ny such list and he wished to make it clear I that the Company 'would not be prepared to be jumped into amendments about which they were not satisfied. There would | fte thought necessarily be a long period of bargaining on this subject which might run into many months. It was only common- sense that the' Company should endeavour to get the best | conditions they could in return for any concessions they made 00 us. if they decided or were obliged to take out the fining lease in December, thty would, he thought, insist on feking it out on the oasis of the mining least as at present stated. Their position was quite firm In law. Any amendments ln the lease could form the subject of negotiation at a later ■ state. ^ I said 1 thought the best thing would be that I should without delay send him a full list of the amendments ,,/e desire to secure and ask him to start on them at once; ^ticularly if there was no extension it was most important 0 get the ground cleared before the mining lease period s Wted, He asked that we should give him the fullest possible formation as to the modifications we wished and that we ^QiUci, if at all possible, produce a comprehensive list to which/wliich no subsequent addition would 'be made. I said that we would 'bear this in mind. 12. Brioish Drillers . I asked what the present position was in this matter. Mr,Ballantyne said he thought there were now ■ 1 or 3 British drillers or engineers in Bahrein, The Company were fully alive to their obligations on this point. I expressed satisfaction. ' 12. B ahrein Government's claim for irrrport cmty on certain ar ticles iraportea by the Gofflpany for use of its employees . (Bushire despatch No.1118-3 of 28th August 1933). I briefly explained the position of this matter to Mr, Ballantyne,(who seemed Quite unaware that any dispute had arisen,) and said that prima facie the Bahrein Government's contention was reasonable.. Mr. Ballantyne seemed disposed to agree that this was the case and said that in any case he quite realised that the .Sheikh*s financial position was poor and that customs were very important. He thought- it unlikely that they would wish to quarrel over a few rupees. I said I would write to him on the subject. J.G.

Moorgate, t London, E.G.2. 25th September, 1933. Dear Mr. Laithwaite, Mr. Butterworth saw Mr. Starling and two | of Ms Colleagues this afternoon, but from what Mr.Butterworth tells me, the discussion was not confined, at any rate on the ! part of-the Petroleum Department's side, to geology. The one important thing which appears to j have emerged from the discussion, is that Mr.Starling and I his Colleagues did not deny it was impossible to select I intelligently 100,000 acres of oil lands on the basiB of the I information so far obtained by the Company from its exploration and prospecting work. Therefore, I think it might be said that the result of the geological discussion 1 was definitely against the conclusions arrived at by the Petroleum Department and on which they gave their advice for the Shaikh of Bahrain to refuse the further extension of the Prospecting Licence. A further point, however, emerges from Mr. , Butterworth's discussion, namely, Mr.Starling with a manifest desire to be helpful, attempted to broaden the discussion so 'that it embraced matters which could not be said to be I Seoiogical. For example, it appears from what Mr. Butterworth says that Mr. Starling enunciated uhe proposition 'that having regard to the time which had elapsed since the tereement was first entered into, the Shaikh ox Bahrain had not received the ''return' which he might reasonaoly have | expected to receive. This does demonstrate, of course, that thethe discussion was not purely technical in the sense of \ycpr letter to me of the 22nd instant and, with respect, it seems to me there was a 'calling-in aid' by His Majesty ! s Petroleum Department of something outside geology to Justify a geological finding. There was a further remark by Mr,Starling which has been recorded, namely, that the selection should leave son&amp;thing of a remainder for others: that statement covers a principle which is definitely outside the scope of the real question which is, Is the Company justified in its request for an extension? Yours &amp;c., (Sd) H. R • BALLANTYNE. 'Laithwaite, Esq., Inc3ia office, Whitehall, S.W.I.IIP P. z.6149/33. OQNPIEENTIAL . Note of a conversation with Mr* Ballantyne of the Bahrein petroleum Company at the India Office on 26th September. Mr. Ballantyne asked for an interview arising out of the discussions between Mr. Butterworth, the technical expert representing the Bahrein petroleum Company, and Mr. Starling on the 25th September. 2. On arrival he said that in the light of Mr. Butterworth's representation of those discussions the letter which he now handed me (circulated separately) had been written by the Company. He had been anxious to present it personally so as to remove any feeling on our part that it was unduly argumentative or hostile in character. 3. After reading the letter I informed Mr.Ballantyne that 1 could not reconcile the statements in it with the report given me by Mr. Starling of his interview with Mr. Butterworth, and indicated that the reply to the letter would take the general line subsequently adopted in my official letter to him, No.P.Z.6149/33 of ^6th September, (copy attached). 4. After a brief further discussion arising out of this statement, I understood Mr. Ballantyne to indicate that the Company were not anxious to pursue further the question of the discussion with the petroleum Department or its results, ana that he now contemplated communicating further with s*n Francisco on the natter of the prospecting licence. On this point he said that (in the light of the discussions which had taken place with the Petroleum Department) it seemed clear to him now that if the Company wanted an extension of the prospecting licence they would have to pay for it. Two forms of payment were possible - a lump sum down or a loan to be refunded from royalties. The Company had always been extremely averse/(uO g v | : - 2 - averse from the payment of a lump sum and he thought they were likely to remain so. They might toe more favourably disposed, towards a loan to 'be repaid from royalties. That was, of course, in the event of their wishing to proceed with a request for a further extension, as to which he could not commit them in any way. i made no comment. ^ the course of conversation I said that we were working on the amendments to he proposed in the mining lease. He said that on this subject we should find the Company 'nice but as obstinate as mules. 1 ' They were sure of their ground in regard to the existing mining lease and if forced to take out that mining lease in December would certainly insist on taking it out on the basis of the existing lease. 1MDIA OFFICE.

Moore, D.S.O., B.H., Admiralty; Mr i . E.A. Seal, Aomiralty; Mr. F.G. Starling, Petroleum Department; llr. K.B. Johnstone, foreign Oftice; ana liSr. G-.E. Crombie, India Office. Mr. Tfli thwaite said that the meeting had oeen called to consider the amen dment s to be pr oposed to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in their mining lease. The views of the Petroleum Department were contained in their memorandum circulated to che interes^ea Departments on the 2nd May, on which comments had subsequently been received from the Colonial Office, Admiralty and India Office, Many of the amendments that had been proposed were apparently purely technical in cnaracter. and designed to cover points for which provision is usually made in oil mining leases. There were, however, certain others of major importance.' In considering the action to be recommended it would not be overlooked that recent interviews with Mr. Ballantyne had shown that (particularxy in view of the refusal of a further extension gratis of the prospecting licence) the Company were likelyV 2 to stand rigidly on their legal position and to yield nothing of importance save in return for a quid pro quo . Our legal posicion in the matter was weak, and, while having regard to the way in which we had met the Company on various points in the past we could reasonably ask for their co-operation, we could not_in thela st r esort insist on having our way in any particular. While, therefore, we should of course aim at obtaining all possible concessions from them, it might- prove desirable to concentrate on the points which we regarded as of real importance, and bo avoid overweighting our list where we felo on weak ground. Mr. Laithwaite added that the mee ting would appreciate first that the question was one o? urgency, and that, whatever might happen as regards an application by the Company for a further extension of their prospecting license, it was desirable to let them know our desiderata without delay: secondly, that as Mr. jBallant-yne had recently req^ItX we should submit a singl e comprehensive list to which no subsequent additions would be made. 2. Mr. Burling, mentioned that we had not merely(\^P/ V 3o 1 J extra givon the Company an/eztension by one year of ' ' their exploration licence and had agreed to a revision of the clause in the prospecting license which would have required them to take in respect of the area co -ncerned out a mining lease/as soon as they had produced 100 tons of oil from a single bore hole, together with permission to use oil in the field operations. We had in addition decided not to press them fas we should have been entitled to) to mark out selected areas under their prospecting license. We might make play with this further point in any communication to them. 34 The meeting proceeded to consider the amendments in the articles of the Mining Lease appended as the third Schedule to the Agreement of 2nd December, 1925 which had been suggested by the interested Departments. The text of the c/ amendments proposed is given below under the respective articles. AETTOIiE Pro posed amendment , 4. After the words ^Ouch right, however, shall not include the exclusive right to sell such products within the leased area', insert the following:~ w The Lessees shall at their own expense forthwith erect and at all times maintain and keep in repair substantial bounda ry m arks at the corners of tHe leased' area according to the demarcation shorn in the plan hereto annexed so that the boundaries of the leased area may at all times be clearly defined. n 5. Mr. starling said that the amendment proposed was common form and that it was improbable that itsacceptance ?/ould involve the Company Incmuoh expenditure. It vvas agreed that the amendment should be put for consideration to the Company• ARTICLE II » (last paragraph). Proposed AiiiendiTient n 6» After the words 'At the expiry of the Agreement the ground and all immovable property left by the Company shall be handed back to the Sheikh' 1 ' add 'all productive wells and borings shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working.' 7 0 Mr. Starling stated that the amendment suggested by the Petroleum Department represented common practice and it was agreed that it should be put for consideration to the Company. AETICLB III , Proposed Aiiiendment . 8. After the words J/ In commercially exploitable quantities' add 'in addition to the amounts referred to in the preceding part of this Article the Company shall pay a royalty at the rate per ton provided in Article VIII on all net crude oil won and saved (i.e., after deductmg water and foreign substances and oil required as fuel for drilling purposes in the Sheikh^ territories and for pumping to field storage)'. This follows the amendment recently made in Article IX of the Second Schedule to the agreement. 9. Mr. Laithwaite said that it was not quite clear that we could assume that because an amendment on the lines proposed had been accepted by the Company in Article 9 of the Second Schedule to their Agreement, they would equally be prepared to accept it in the case of the mining lease since it apparently involved acceptance of an(iV5 5. additional financial tmrden over a longer period. 10. After discussion it was agreed that the amenciment might at any rate he put to the Company ana their reaction awaited. Articles 111 ana IX . Petroleum De-partment 'proposal s 11. 'It should he noted that the annual dead rent payable 'by the Company remains at Rs. 10,000 per annum for five years, or until the Company declares that oil has he en found in corrmercially exploitable quantities, after which the dead rent 'becomes Hs.30,000. In view of the extensions which have been granted to the Compariy and the fact that oil has already been proved in two wells, it is perhaps worth considering whether they could not be asked, in return for the further extension of the prospecting licence which they are now demanding, to make an annual payment of Hs.50,000 at an earlier date than that provided in form of lease. As at present•provided the Company need not make the declaration until five years from the date of the mining lease.' 12. Considerable discussion took place as t-o the desirability of suggesting to the Company the modification proposed. Mr. 31ar 1 in k said that since puouing forward tills suggestion he had given further consideration to the matter. Under sub -paragraph 2 of .article IX of uie mining lease JLt was open to the shaikh, on the advice of zhq Political Resident, to take tiie Company to arbitration over the Question of commercial exploitation, and uhis action might be justified after the mining lease had d^en in lorce lor a comparatively short period. It was not of course desirable to throw any doubt on the rights of the Shaikh in ohis connection. With the oojecc of avoiding such a uispute io might/I ^ o might be put to the Company that some alteration of Article 1/ should 'be made. This, if it could be secured, might avoid the necessity for any alteration ox Article III (See paragraphs 8-10 above). After considerable discussion the general sense of the meeting was that it would probably be desirable to indicate to the Company in general terms that while the Shaikh was of course entitled in certain circumstances to appeal to arbitration if dissatisfied, some modification mignt mctke i or smoother working without materially affecting the financial interests of the Company. It was generally felt that the proposal was not one that should be pressed if the Company manifested opposition to it; and that the terms in ^vnich it should be put to the Company (if it were decided to mention it in a written communication)would require careful consideration- Article V. 13. The Petroleum Department had pointed out that the meaning of the paragraph beginning 'If the ucmpany's worj£ is delayed by such events as are mentioned in this Article' did not seem very olear. It appeared as if the word 'of' has been omitted after the word 'expiration'. The Colonial Office had suggested that the Petroleum department might suggest a revised wording which could be submitted to the C cmpany. 14. It was agreed that it would suffice to suggest tne of the word 'of' after the word expiration ♦ Article VIII. Pr o p o s e d amendm ent s . pj A.fter words 'Rs.10,000 provided for in Article 111 add (i) instead of 'for the customary operations of the Company's installations', say 'oil required as fuel for drilling purposes in the Shaikh's territories and for pumping to/7. (ii)/ to field storage'• (ii) 'A royalty of 4 annas per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas sold 'by the lessees and c alculated at an absolute pressure of one atmosphere and at a temperature of 60 o P. n (iii) 'A royalty of 1 anna per gallon in respect of all casing head gasoline recovered and sold by the Lessees'. Note: - The form of mining lease does not contain any provision for royalty on natural gas sold or for royalty on casing head gasoline, which is usually charged for at a higher rate of royalty than in the case of crude oil. It may bo that no sales of natural gas will take place in the case of Bahrein Island but as the Lease will run for a period of 55 years, it is desirable that it should include such a provision- (iv) Add to this Article provision for measuring crude oil won for purposes of royalty assessment and for the keeping ol accounts by the Company. 16. (i) On the first amendment suggested in this article by the Petroleum Department Mr.Starling remarked that the point was one of some little importance which had caused considerable difficulty in Trinidad. It was desirable to make clear to what extent the Company were at liberty to use, without payment, oil won in Bahrein. The amendment, which was being adopted in Trinidad, ana. was also in operation in a number of other countx'ies would have the el feet of i esxi icting them to its use in connection with their technical operavions and would dispose of any question as to their liberty to use it for the benefit of employees, etc. The meeting agreed that the amendment might be put to the Company.-S) ^ 8» (ii) On the second amendment it was pointed out that in the event of natural gas being found the provision in question would involve the Company in additional payments to the Shaikh. It would 'be better uherexoie to make sure of our ground 'before putting the amendment to them. The Petroleum Department stated that a provision of this nature appeared in both the Iraq, oil concessions and that it represented normal modern practice, although it was of fairly recent development. It was impossible to judge to what extent there was Lively to be any output of natural gas now or later. The meeting agreed that the point should be put to the C anpany. (iii) On the third amendment Mr.Starling stated that while an amendment of this nature would admittedly involve the 0anpany in some expenditure it represented normal modern practice, and might he thought reasonably be put to them. He recognised the probability that there might have to be bargaining with the Company bo en on this and on the preceding suggestion. The meeting agreed that it might be put to one C ompany. (iv) On the fourth amendment it wa s agreed that the Company shou ld be invited to add to/article p rovisions for these purpos es. The provisions could be the same as those already included in clause 3 of the Agreement of 15th February 1933 between the Shaikh and the Sanrein Petroleum Ccmpany, in connection with oil won under the prospecting license. The Company had been willing to a-ree to the insertion of corresponding provisionsin the mining lease at the time and had desisted from doing so only 'because H.M.G. had suggested that all mining lease amendments could 'best be dealt with together. Difficulty need not therefore probably be anticipated in connection with this amendment, which it was agreed should be put to the Company. Article 10. • Proposed - amendment. 17. At end of Article add 'If the operations for winning crude oil shall be abandoned or discontinued for 12 months (except on account of force majeure or the causes specified in Article V) the Shaikh may thereupon give the Lessees notice in writing of such abandonment or cUser^iti.nusr. discontinuance and call upon them to resume operations, and in the event of such operations not being resumed to the satisfaction of the Sh- ikh within two calendar months from the date of such notice, the Shaikh may thereupon cancel and determine this Lease.' 18. It was pointed out that here again the effect of the amendment proposed by the Petroleum Department would be further to pin down the Company and that some difficulty might therefore be expected with them in connection witn it. It was however jaE^ssd that it should 'be put to them. The custoiitary' and. was amendment was/not in itself unreasonable, though the Company might of course not unnaturally prefer to ietain its present freedom of action. Article 12. ?r Q-oosed amendment. 19. At end of this Article add 'The Lessees undertake •flWWV** ' ' ' ' _ |r|| nvrn.!, at all times during the continuance of this Lease to carry on all operations for winning and working crude oil and natural gas in a skilful and workmanlike manner in accordance with modern approved methocis and to maintain all pi oductive wells in good repair, working order and condition.

Minerals, other than petroleum and cognate products, should be reserved to the Sheikh, who should retain the right to lease them to other parties, provided that the operations of the Company are not thereby obstructed. 29. Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that the substances for which the Company were at liberty to search were enumerated in Article 1 of the mining lease and suggested that there might be some danger that an amendment in the sense proposed would be restrictive. It was agreed alter discussion that the amendment should be dropped. P. Proposed Addition . 30. The Company should undertake to offer no unnecessary or reasonably avoidable obstruction or interruption to the d^ yeloment aq&amp; mTkm g of any minerals (other than petroleum or cognate products) including water and to afford to the Sheikn and to the holders of prospecting licences or mining leases In respect of other minerals reasonable means of access to such minerals for the purpose of working and carrying away the same. 31...

(See Air Ministry letter of 13th Ivlay 1929). The Air Ministry now intimate that it is desirea to retain ti e landing grounds both at Muharrao. and r^nama® The area required is not stated. 33a Considerable discussion took place on this Question. v ' y ' 1 The India Office undertook to check the references which had been made in discussions with the Company or Major Holmes in regard to landing grounds for aeroplanes and seaplanes ana the nature of any existing understanding with the Company on this subject; and also to ascertain what references had been made oy tne Company or oy Major Holmes to the intentions of the Company as regards the dredging of Khor Kaliya. It- was agreed tnat tne ^amiralty should at once get in touch with Uie Air Ministry with a view to ascertaining what 9 if any 9 developments tnere had been in connection with the leasing of land for Government purposes in Bahrein, that tne. india On ice should infoimaHy consult Colonel Fowls as to the desirability am practicability of obtaining from the Sheikh on a snort lease the tip of land at Eas aiJasra- but that any reference to the Company on the subject of the mining lease amendments should for the moment avoid specifying the precise area we had in mind (since this was still uncertain) and should be on general lines and consist of a reference to the existing understanding as regards landing grounds and a statement that it was lor consideration whether this should noo oy included in tne lease and that we should in any case in due course inform the Company of the precise areas affected.13. o4:# The meeting took note oi one iuc o tiiy ^t iu welj no desired to retain the landing grounds both at Muharraq and a t AB,najiia« • r.i Vtf H.

The meeting agreed that while we v/era not in a position to press such a demand if tne ^ou^janv ibfuoed14. it, particularly if, as seemed possible, insistence on a refinery clause would involve the CQupany in consideraole extra expenditure, it was of great importance if at all possible to secure that the oil should De refined in Bahrein 'but that it was clearly undesirable to raise the point with the Company if they iriLandod in any event refining locally. It was desirable moreover in any action we took to shelter behind the Shaikh. They decided to recommend in these circumstances that the India Office should at once telegraph to the Acting Resident to ascertain whether from his local knowledge of Bahrein he could throw any light on the intentions of the Company as regards refining, or whether any suitable opportunity could be taken of ascertaining discreetly how the land lay. The telegram should also state that we were anxious in informing the Company of our mining lease desiderata to say that the Shaikh had been enquiring as to the arrangements proposed and was anxious that the oil should be refined in Bahrein and that if ne saw no objection he should endeavour to obtain tne Shaikivs authority for a statement to this effect. I. Right of pre -emption in time of waiL._ 37. This subject was exhaustiv ely d is cuss ed. The main considerations were that we had no legal claim to demand such a modification of the lease from the Company (the position was different in the case of Koweit where there was as yet no lease in existence and where we were [2\ free to negotiate terms of such a lease); that the Company were prima facie, very unlikely in the circumstances to be willing to accede to such a request; that there was^^7w) 15. the further da,nger that 'by raising the point at this stage in a case in which we were on weak ground, we might show cur hand prematurely, with unfortunate reactions on the position in Koweit, and possibly on British oix interests in other parts #f the world. On the other hand it clearly was of great importance that in the event of war we should be assured of control of Bahrein oil operations. assumption that the Shaikh was a sovereign and could in the event'of a war in which he was our ally (a natural assumption) • t — passTan ordinance on similar lines to those which would be passed in British territory taking over control (suhject to compensation - which would of course nave to oe met and not by the Shaikh - to the lessee or other interested party)-for the period of emergency over the oil output, ete., it appeared on the whole that the balance of advantage lay with trusting to the power and readiness of the Shaikh (advised by H.M.G.) to take action on these lines if and when the time came, and that it would on Uie whole on this assumption be unnecessary and undesirable, having regard to the considerations already mentioned, to raise the point specifically with the Company. 38. It was agreed in conclusion that the points discussed above appeared to cover all the points of i mportance to us and that it should be possibletc present t^TTv^^T ^hout delay with a comprehensive and fma l list of the amendments which we desired in tne mining lease. ^ndia Office, 3rci October 1933.-.z. 636 9/33.

P.C* STARLING. Laithwaite, ^sq., ^dia Office, Whitehall, S.W.I.63$9/33. NOTE 0- INTEBVIE'. .iiH :iR&gt; EUTTEHWORTH . Mr. Butterworth, a technical expert of the standard Oil Gompany, of California, had an interview with Mr. Starling on September 25th, 1933. Mr. J.L. Jeffery and Mr. H.P.W. Siffard were also present, Mr. starling explained that this meeting had been arranged at Mr. Ballantyne's request in order that the technical aspects - O^WWllllt ' ■■ v ■ ihkiiwi''' 11 ''' K ''' ' fV of the application nade by the Bahrein Petroleum Company for an extension of the prospecting licence for a further period of one year from December next might be discussed with the Petroleum apartment by a technical representative of the Company. Mr. Butterworth said that was his understanding of the position. In reply to a question by Mr. Starling he explained that he had no direct knowledge of Bahrein. He brought no documents with him, and he did not appear to have been furnished j S v C riflmi i ri i imirtiVil* 1 i il tri-l** 1 '' with any of the Company ? s geological reports or details of the well records, He said the position had been broadly indicated to him, and he understood that he would be allowed to see copies of the documents which the Company had supplied to H.M. Government. O UQT;''..': * ^ ■ii . ■ r v;' P Mr. : tarling accordingly briefly explained the position in regard to the Agreement which the Company had with the Sheikh, and Mr. Butterworth was shown a copy of the Company's report and a map of Bahrein indicating the position of the wells. After looking at the data submitted to him guU^rWQrth said that , although the results obtained in the first two wells might be regarded as encouraging, a good deal of further and perhaps deeper drilling would, in his view, be necessary in order to define the extent of the field and to enable the Company to make an advantageous selection of areas. For this he considered that a further extension of the prospecting licence would be necessary. For instance, he thought it would be desirable/ Idesirable to ascertain how far the oil zone extended in more than one direction. The results of further test drilling might, for example, disclose whether it would be advisable for the Company to select as part of their area one of the outside islands. He could only deal with the matter on general technical grounds in the absence of detailed information. Mr. Starling pointed out that eight years had elapsed since the concession was first granted, five years of which .. .v.,-,.. ' • - '** had been occupied in geological exploration and three years under prospecting licence. This was certainly much longer than was allowed in other countries according to information available to the Petroleum department, and Mr. Starling said he would be glad to hear Mr. Butterworth T s views on that point and what the practice was in the United States. Mr. Butterworth replied that the periods differed as between one country and another, but it was not unusual to grant longer periods in the case of territories where oil prospecting had not previously been carried out. He had not been in the United States for several years, and he could not state the present position there. He knew that some fairly long periods had been allowed in places like Alaska. He then asked what was our understanding of the kina of work which was expected to be carried out under an exploration licence and prospecting licence, respectively. Mr. starling explained that under an exploration licence the work was generally limited to a surface geological survey with shallow excavations (say to a depth of 20 feet) - this was the ^ 41... basis of the present agreement. The object of the prospecting —• a fc.'• rr.« period was to enable such drilli ng to be car ried out, to test whether the structures discovered by the geological survey were in fact productive, as could be accomplished in the lime available. In his view the prospecting period was not intended to provide for an exhaustive drilling programme, and it was quite usual to find that, after a mining lease had been taken , out/out, further test drilling was necessary to determine the plan of commeroial aevelopment. The Petroleum department considered that, in view of the time which had been available both for the geological survey and the prospecting work, and in view of the amount of work which had been done when the Company furnished the information and which might be done between then and the end of December, the Company should, be in a position to make a reasonable selection of its area of 100,0'X) acres without a further extension of time, Mr. Butterwort h said that it must necessarily take some time to correlate the sub-surface geology, as ascertained by borings, with the surface geology. In California, however, he knew of a case where three quite good structures had been mapped which were close together in the same field but of these two only proved to be productive. Thus, we could not place reliance on the results obtained by one or two test borings. He thought it was important in the interests of the Sheikh that the island should be developed as a unit by one responsible company in order to avoid the evils of competitive drilling, a situation which might arise if the Company selected an area on the main island and other areas on the adjacent islands. Mr. Starling .said that, judging by the plan of drilling indicated on the msp, it would appear that the Company had reached some fairly firm conclusions as to the general run of the structure. Bahrein had more than once been suggested as a likely oil producing territory, and 20 years ago a report was oiade which gave considerable details of the geology of the island and of the anticlinal structure which was believed io exist there. This report could be found in the Geological Survey Memoirs of India. «r: i .tsrling thanked Mr. Butterworth for coming, and said S, that he was glad to have had an opportunity of exchanging views with him.INDIA omcji,.

In 1914 an agreement was entered into providing for the reconstitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company, from which the National Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new paiticipants being the Anglo Persian Oil Company. 50 per cent.; the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Compajny and the Deutsche Bank 25 per cent. each. This agreement also provided that the three Soups should g^ undertakings not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production of oil in the Ottoman Empire m Europe and Asia (excluding Egypt, Koweit and the Transferred Territories) except through the Turkish Petroleum Company. This agreement was signed by the But sh and Gei^ Governments, and by the groups concerned. As the luikish Petroleum Company was then predominantly British, this arrangement had the effect of securing he whole of this area to interests which were predominantly British.

The company had a nominal capital of £1 million in £1 shares. In March 1933 the board of this company was reconstructed, and the Foreign Office was informed by the company that the directorate was as follows :— Viscount Goschen {chairman). Other British directors (5) : Sir Edward Mountain (deputy chairman), the late Admiral Lord Wester Wemyss, Lord Glenconner (director of Hambro's Bank), W. R. Brown (director of British Union Oil Company), and Sir Alwin Dickinson (formerly the representative of the British Government on the British Phosphate Commission) as managing director. Italian directors (3) : Professor Alessandro Martelli, Gr. Uff. Arnaldo Petretti, and Gr. Uff. Vittorio Amoretti (Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli). German directors (2) : Herr Thomas Brown and Herr M. Hirschfeld. French director (1) : M. Paul Girod. Iraq Government director (1) : Jafar Pasha-el-Askeri; a total of thirteen. The company is not known to be at present interested in Saudi Arabia. (3) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company {A.P.O.C.). —See at (1) above as to fA.P.O.C.'s participation in the I.P.C. and the restrictions imposed thereby. The A.P.O.C. has, however, in addition to its main concession in Persia, which has been confirmed by a revised agreement with the Persian Government, dated the 29th April, 1933, a separate interest also in Iraq, where, through its subsidiary, the Khaniqin Oil Company, it has a concession in the ' Transferred Territories ' under agreements with the Iraq Government on the 30th August, 1925, and the 24th May, 1926. It also has freedom of action in Koweit, where it is competing for a concession with the Eastern and General Syndicate, representing the Gulf Oil Corporation. I (4) The Eastern and General Syndicate. —This is a British company registered in Xugust 1920 with a nominal capital of £125,300. The chairman and managing director is E. W. Janson, and the other directors are F. W. Gamble, H. T. Adams and P. C. Tarbutt. It has, at various times, acquired concessions in Bahrein and Arabia, but has never carried out any really effective work, its sole object being apparently to obtain concessions and traffic in them to other parties. The company at one time approached the Anglo-Persian without success, and in 1927 and 1929 transferred its interests to the Eastern Gulf Oil Corporation of U.S.A. (see under (5) below). Its local representative is Major F. Holmes, j (5) The Gulf Oil Corf oration is a wholly American concern, working in the Nlar East through its subsidiary, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The Gulf Oil Corporation is a powerful company engaged in producing, transporting, refining and marketing oil throughout the LTnited States, east of the Rocky Mountains. is also engaged in producing oil in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, and markets oil extensively in Europe. The principal interest in it is that of the Mellon familv, who are said to have come in originally as financiers and to have ^ftded up with an 80 per cent, interest. The Gulf is an independent company, but it is interested with the Socony—Vacuum Company (a recent merger of the Standard Oil Company of New York and Vacuum Oil Company), and S.O., New Jersey, in the I.P.C. It is also interested with the Eastern and General Syndicate io. a possible concession in Koweit. In 1927 it obtained an option from the Eastern and General on the Bahrein Concession, which the syndicate nad secured in December 1925. Eventually, however, this concession was taken over by the Standard Oil of California, presumably because the Gulf, as a member of the I P.C., could not hold it. In 1929 it'acquired from the Eastern and General '[879 1—1] B 2Syndicate an option over any rights which the syndicate might possess in Hasa, the neutral zone and Koweit. It could only operate concessions in Hasa and probably also in the neutral zone with the permission of the I.P.C. (6) Standard Oil Company of Cahfornia. —After the break-up of the Standard Oil Group in 1912, many members of the group became independent, including the above company. This company is one of the largest oil companies in the United States, and is a complete unit, being engaged in producing, refining, transporting and marketing crude oil and refined products. The company is engaged in production in eight States in the United States, and has oil properties in Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. The Standard Oil Company of California and the Gulf are independent of each other, although there is a general impression that the various Standard Oil Companies still have some community of interest and are prepared to co-operate in matters of general policy. At times, however, there has been keen competition between them. As pointed out above, the Standard Oil Company of California holds the Bahrein Concession, which it operates through the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a Canadian Corporation. It has also just secured from Ibn Saud an oil concession in Hasa, full particulars of which are not yet available. (C)— Past Concessions affecting Saudi Arabia. (1) Northern Hejaz. —It is possible that certain concessionary rights were granted in Turkish times, but this subject has not been explored in the Legation, There was talk of a concession under the Hashimite regime and Mr. Philby was one of those interested, but there is no evidence of a Hashimite concession having been granted. Any interest of Mr. Philby's is presumably identical with that of Midian (Limited), an inactive but still going concern, closely allied with Sharqieh (Limited). (2) Jedda (Hejaz, West Coast of Arabia).—Two American engineers (Twitchell and Crane) carried out investigations for oil in 1931. The Petroleum Department brought the matter to the notice of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who replied that the geological prospects in this area were not regarded as favourable (see under paragraph (A) (1)). (3) Mils ca t. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company obtained a concession in 1925 to prospect for oil for a period of two years with the right to a mining lease, but this concession has now lapsed. (4) Mokalla. —The Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company started negotiations for a concession in 1928-29, but the matter was not proceeded with as they reached the conclusion that the prospects of discovering petroleum were quite unfavourable. (5) Hasa. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company applied, probably for prospecting rights only, to Ibn Saud in 1921. The E.G.S. came into the field later. At the beginning of 1923 Major Holmes submitted a draft concession to Sir P. Cox. In March 1923, the latter, acting under instructions from home, suggested to Ibn Saud that he should decide nothing until he had had an opportunity of considering an offer by A.P.O.C., whom His Majesty's Government considered to have a prior claim. About the same period or earlier the two companies were in touch with each other with a view to sharing interests, and it is stated that at one point they went through a pretence of breaking off negotiations so that Ibn Saud might give the concession to E.G.S. in ignorance of the interest of A.P.O.C., to whom he was hostile. Be that as it may, E.G-S. got the concession, and on the 6th May, 1923, Ibn Saud granted an oil concession (including the Qatif and Jubail areas) to the Eastern and General Syndicate. Major Holmes gave an undertaking not to sell any part of the concession ~ the A.P.O.C., and His Majesty's Government thought of trying to induce lb 11 to cancel this restriction, but the proposal was abandoned in May 1924- the A.P.O.C. were left out in the cold. The final terms of the concession to E.G.S. are not known, but tLc^ 0 are indications that it followed the draft which had been submitted to Sir P. Cox That draft, and probably the actual concession, included inter alia, provision for the following ;— {a) Lapse of the concession if E.G.S. should fail to start operation^ in a specified manner within nine months. (h) Government right to cancel the concession after any continuous ce ^tion of operations for more than twenty months.ic) Payment of £3,000 a year for 'special protection' in half-yearly pay ments, to begin sixty days after date. {d) Payment of £6,000 under pain of nullity of the concession, sixty days after date. {e) Arbitration in the event of any dispute. It is not clear what, if anything, E.G.S. did to implement the undertaking to start operations. It is known that on the 26th April, 1924, two geologists of theirs left Koweit to make a preliminary survey in ' Nejd, Koweit Neutral Zone and Hasa,' but it is not known to what this led. Anyhow, Major Holmes was in difficulties with Ibn Saud in October 1925, because, according to Bushire telegram to the Colonial Office of the 31st October, {d) Ibn baud had refused to alter a clerical error of date, and (1) E.G.S. would advance no more money. There was also apparently difficulty in obtaining financial support in London owing to the non-existence of British diplomatic representation at Nejd. It was probably at this time or a little later that E.G.S. and Major Holmes estranged Ibn Saud by refusing a payment which he claimed. There is no evidence that Ibn Saud formally cancelled the concession at this juncture. When, however, E.G.S. entered into an agreement with the Gulf Company on the 30th November, 1927, in regard to this, the Neutral Zone Concession and the hoped-for concession in Koweit, they admitted that both the former were 'at least subject to forfeiture and cancellation, if not actually null and void.' The negotiations which led to the grant of a concession in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California are understood to have been conducted by that .company directly, and not through the intervention of the E.G.S. (6) Koweit Neutral Zone. —On the 17th May, 1924, an oil concession is 'alleged tb have^Been granted jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit to the E.G.S. The E.G.S., by an agreement of the 30th November, 1927, transferred any rights which it might possess or acquire or which could be reinstated in Hasa or the Neutral Zone as well as in Koweit to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The history of the concession is somewhat obscure. A recent Colonial Office memo randum concludes from a review of the known facts the impression .... that Ibn Saud did actually grant the concession on hi^ own without the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit.' As against this, E.G.S. definitely claimed to have got the concession from both, and it seems hardly likely that they would have committed themselves to this statement if it were untrue, in their definite legal agreement with the Gulf Company of the 30th November, 1927, as they certainly did. In any case, however, the grounds for considering this concession to have lapsed are even stronger than in the case of the Hasa Concession. E.G.S. not only admitted in the agreement with Gulf that it was like the other 'at least subject to forefeiture,' &amp;c., but stated in a letter to the Colonial Office of the 19th December, 1928, that it had 'never been made operative.' The Sheikh of Koweit's account of this concession is given in a recent despatch from the Political Agent dated the 6th July, 1933, which states that the Political Resident had an interview with the sheikh and discussed the matter. The sheikh's recollection was that Ibn Saud gave the Hasa Concession proper to Major Holmes in the spring of 1923, its chief clause being that unless Major Holmes started work within three years the concession would lapse. Ibn Saud wrote in the summer of 1923 and sent the sheikh a draft draft joint concession in respect of the Koweit Neutral Zone, which he wished to give to Major Holmes's company, the E.G.S., and asking the sheikh to sign it. His Majesty's Government inf(Yarned the sheikh that he could sign the joint concession. The concession was ac ai , JV signed in April 1924, and consisted of only four pages, and it was duly s e&gt;w Ibn Saud. About a year afterwards Major Holmes had a disagreement with ibn Saud, who informed Major Holmes that the joint Neutral Zone Co ; it,|3ssion was there and then cancelled. Ever since the Sheikh of Koweit has assumed the joint concession to be a dead letter, that is to say, from about April 1925. The Sheik of Koweit has been unable to ascertain whether Ibn Saud has included the Neutral Zone in the Hasa Concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company of California. ^ ff) Farsan Islands, now also a fart of Saudi Arabia. —E.G.b. would appear to have obtained some sort of a concession for the Earsans (and possibly the ' '•'nd of Asir) from Hasan-al -Idrisi in 1926. It is not clear what became ofthis concession, if the grant was complete, but it was superseded by a concession6 for the Farsans given by the Idrisi on the 25th September, 1926, to a Mr. Cooper wiio marketed it to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell jrroup), Ihe latter formed the Red Sea Petroleum Company to work it. This company started operations of some importance at Zifaf Island. The Idrisi acting it was thought at the time, under Italian influence, but more probably under that of Ibn baud, made difficulties in the summer of 1927. After abortive e torts by the company to overcome them. Ibn Saud came forward ostensibly in the role of honest broker between the Idrisi, now his vassal, and the company.' A conference held at Wizan in December 1927 under his auspices between the representatives of the company and the Idrisi was again abortive. Ibn Saud eventuaHy intimated 'a decision in the question of the dispute which we were asked to settle between the Red Sea Petroleum Company and the Idrisi Govern ment to the eitect that a new concession should be drawn up and that in the meantime it would be undesirable to accede to a request which the company had put torward for permission to transfer their operations from Zifaf to Great f arsan He suggested that the company should send a representatiye to Jedda to negotiate the revised concession. On his persisting in this attitude the company decided to withdraw from the islands and in September 1928 thev fwT f material under the auspices of H.M.S. Dahlia. It must be assumed that this terminated any rights under the Cooper Concession. The Shell Company Ma ids state d that it is not interested to reopen operations in the Farsan (D)— Present Position. Whatever view might possibly be held as to the legal position in regard to past concessions it is quite certain that Ibn Saud believes himself to be quit of miv be Zn^ H 18 pr °^ 7 risht - The P0siti0n m re S ard t0 the va ™ u s areas may be summed up as follows :— niJi 1 flrlfZ t/iern If /J az -~ Midian (Limited), closely associated with Sharqieh no reason tnS ^ . c ° ncera ' ma y have had rights in this area, but there is present survive.

Major Holmes is the symbol of industry and is kindness itself. Gentlemen,it is now more than ten years since ■yv he came to Bahrain,and since thei the star of prosperity ■ has dawned on Bahrain. The schemes that he has introduced have brought this prosperity. The oil which he discovered in Bahrain has changed the history of Bahrain and all eyes are now on Bahrain. This is not the only thing he has done: ; it was mentioned in history that abundant water lay hidden in these islands,yet water was only available to the rich. L It was at such a time that this person,in whose honour this farewell party is given,introduced the water supply scheme. 3 Water was thus brought within reach of all poor through his t sole efforts. (To Major Holmes). Sir,you are going to leave this country,we wish you all good luck and though you are now leaving, let (i)t be known to you that you are leaving monuments in Bahrain which can never be efaced,such as the artesian wells,which has increased the fertility of2. Bahrain soil,the products of which will at all times be available to us,and the wells of gold (i.e.,oil): these are proofs of which I have mentioned above. May you be blessed and rest assured that your name shall be written in the current history of Bahrain in letters of gold. We pray to God that He may help you in all you undertake,and that Bahrain may be crowned with success and industry under the guidance of our Ruler,H.E Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah,the Political Agents,the Musteshar and the brothers and sons of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad,and salaams.(|(/D Confidential # No:C/4?4-iO/l(Y). fL.A h ' J r 0 m Political Agency, Bahrain, tiie Ibth October 1933.

Bahrain Oil. Bahrain Oil.File Mo;lQ/l.¥ » Note. 20th October 1933 * During the Agency it Home Mr.SKIMER asked for a few minutes of my time. 2. He informed me he had received a long cable from Mr.BiLLANTYHE (London) that morning. 3. He went on to say that the B a HB a IK PETROLEUM OOMPiJI were most anxious to have more time for prospecting. He (Mr.SKIVER) felt that they were entitled to another year under the Prospecting License. 4. In London there had been a Technical Conference which had,however,wandered from technical matters to the SHAIKHS lack of money. 5# His London Principals had asked him to try to find out what offer would inauce the SHAIKH to grant an extension of the Prospecting License. They wanted 13 months from and Lecember 193^,i.e.,to end of Lecember 1934. 6. They thought of offering:- (I) Es.^b.OOQ as a cash present to the SlilEB (non-reco7eraDle) 3 (ii) Es.?5,Q00 cash advance against future Hoyalties. ?. The rent at Hs. 10,000 per annum would continue during the 13 months,if extended. 8. Mr .SKINHEB went on to say that the Company were doing more than the stipulated amount of work for they would have three instead of two ^strings' working until oil 'declared' (see Article I of the 'lining Lease). 9. He said that the Oil Field would not be a commercial proposition until at least 1,000 Tons were extracted daily. 1,000 Tons # Rs.3/B per ton would give Rs. 3,500/- daily and (2)say Rs.lB^jSOO annuallj as Royalty to the SHAIKH. 10. He reiterated his preTious assertion tliat the oil would not compete with the ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL GOMPAlI's markets in the GULP, it would be sent to AMERICA- There was no room for a second marketting concern in this small area. 11. I asked Mr.SKIMIJi to let me have this request for negotiation in writing and I explained that I would then at once inform the RSSIDEMT,who would instruct me in due course as to action to be taken ?is-a-yis the SHAIKH. Mr.SKIHHBB appeared to hesitate at committing his 'offer' to writing,but I explained that he could word his letter in the way he had already put the matter to me. Without any 'offer' the SHAIKH would have nothing to 'consider', fhe mention of reference to the BBSIPEHf and perhaps LOfiDOf made him fear loss of valuable time. I reassured him and he understood the reason for my request before leaving and agreed to send in a letter. 12. Mr.BSLGRAVll was then (20.00 hours; informed of the position and that I woula not delay in referring the matter to BUSHIRE. E.G. 21/10/33.

The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, to the Politxcal Agent,Bahrain ' I have received telegraphic instructions from the London Ofiice ot the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited,to request you to advise His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain that this Company wishes to make the following tentatative offer: In return for an extension of the Prospecting License lor 13 months trom December 2nd,1933,to January 2nd ^1935, the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited:- (1) will pay for the private purse of the Shaikh of isanrain Rs.&lt;i5,000 not recoverable,payment to be made m lump sum or in instalments wnichever is preterrea by the Bahrain Government; ^ any iuture annual royalties in excess of Rs.b0,u00; (S) Should the Compaav not apply for a Mining Lease by December ^d.1934,the Shaikh of Bahrain will nave the right to a proportionate part of the regular annual rental to cover the period from December 2nd,1934 to January 2nd,1935. The short time remaining before the expiration of the Prospecting License (December 2nd,1933) necessitates prompt action on this offer. For this reason we are mak-i Tig the oiler as simple as possible and in tentative form so that it may be discussed with the Shaikh of Bahrain and the interested oilices oi His Britannic Majesty^s Government.

Section 5. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received August 16.) (No. 235.) Jedda, July 25, 1933. ' WITH reference to Sir Andrew Ryan's telegram No. 108 of the 30th May last, relative to the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, I have the honour to inform you that the official announcement was made on the 10th July by Government decree published in a special supplement of the Umm-al-Qura of that date, ihe decree, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, appeared unaccompanied by the terms of the concession, but announced that an agreement would in fact shortly be published and alluded to a ' special agreement,' which was also to be brought into force. 2. The Umm-al-Qura duly published, in two instalments, in its issues of the 14th and 21st July, the terms of the concession, a document of thirty-three articles, a translation of which I enclose herewith. The concession is to come into force as from the 7th July, 1933, and active operations are contemplated before the end of September 1933. 3. From a brief study of the text, the absence of details in respect of the sums to be paid by the Company as a preliminary payment (article 3), as rent (article 4), and also the lack of information regarding the exact area to be exploited, are conspicuous, and in a number of other particulars the text is, perhaps not unintentionally, vague. The &lt;c special agreement,' to which allusion is made in the decree, must therefore contain these interesting items of information, which the parties to the agreement intend, it would appear, should not be divulged. 4. A copy of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. EDclosure 1 in No. 1. (Translation.)

Directly after the date on which this agreement comes into force the Company shall proceed with its plans together with other preparations for geological work and arrangements for work, so that it may make use of the cold weather which enables it to undertake effectual field work, and to carry out the clerical work and make reports, &amp;c., during the hot season. In any case, the field work should not be delayed more than the end of September 1933. Such work should be energetically and strenuously continued till the beginning of digging operations or up to the end of the agreement. Article 6. Within ninety days from the date on which digging operations start the Company shall leave or surrender to the Government the places (areas) of the allowed zone which the Company may decide are not needed for further work or for use in another form or manner in connexion with this project. The Company should also surrender to the Government from time to time during the period of this agreement other areas which the Company may decide are no longer required for inspection or investigation and for use for any purpose which may have connexion with this scheme. All the places (areas) which are gi\en up by the Company will be released from the restrictions and conditions of this agreement, but the Company will have the permanent right to employ those aieas for the purposes of transport and communications during the duration of this agreement, provided that this practice should have a slight connexion only with the other form or method in which these parts (areas) surrendered by the Company can be used. Article /. The Company should begin with the operations of digging as soon as it (the Company) discovers the place suitable for the same, and, in any case, if the Company fails to proceed with the operations of digging within a peiiod of three years as from the end of September 1933 (subject to the observation of the provisions of article 24 of this agreement), the Government may then terminate this agreement. Whenever the Company begins with the operations of digging, it should persevere with energy until it discovers oil in commercial quantities or until it terminates this agreement, and if the Company fails to give notice regarding the date on which oil is discovered, then the date to be fixed for this purpose will be counted as from the date on which the Company completed the dkeW of one well or wells, examines them and discovers that they can supply not less than 2,000 tons of crude oil daily and for a period of thirty days consecutively in conformity with the reliable practice observed m first-class oil fields. The operations of digging include the ordering of tools and othei machines and their shipment to Saudi Arabia, and also include the preparation of roads camps, buildings, fittings, transport, communications and fitting machines and other means for well-digging. Article 8. Immediately after the discovery of oil in commercial quantities the Company should give the Government the loan already agreed upon, and after one year another loan should be given to the Government. The date of paying the first loan will be the date on which oil is discovered m commercial quantities as provided for in this agreement, and the date of offering the second oan will be after one year from that date, and in both cases the Government will grant the Company I period of sixty days' delay so as to enable it to pay the loan during that period. _ Article 9. As it has been agreed that the annual rent will be paid up to the date of discovering oil in commercial quantities, and as it has also been agreed tha the annual reSt should be paid in advance, therefore it is possible that the last payment of the annual rent before the date of discovering 0| l ln commercia quantities mav include a certain period after the date on which the oil is discovered, and if this extra period is equal to one-fifth of the year or more, the amount proportionate to that period will be considered as a loan due by the G-overnment. [879 q—5] b 24 Article 10. As soon as it becomes possible {i.e., the Company will be allowed a reasonable time for ordering additional tools and for their shipment to Saudi Arabia to meet the additional work after the date of discovering oil in commercial quantities), the Company should continue digging, by means of two digging machines, till it completes digging all over the fixed zone, in conformity with the practice observed in first-class oil-fields, or until this agreement expires. Article 11. The Company shall pay to the Government royalty on all crude oil drawn out oi stored, and which runs or flows from the field storage, after deducting— First: Water and other foreign substances. Second : Oil which will be required by the Company for its ordinary work within Saudi Arabia. Third : Oil which will be required for the purpose of manufacturing quantities of benzine and kerosene, which will be supplied free to the Government every year in pursuance of article 16 of this agreement. The amount of royalty on each ton net weight of crude oil will be (a) 4^. gold or its equivalent, or [b) in accordance with the choice which the Company may make at the time of payment of each instalment, 1 American dollar on each ton of crude oil, plus the difference in the rate of exchange in accordance with the average of the rates of exchange for the three months before the payment of the instalment. For instance, if the average rate of exchange is 1 dollar or 14 cents United States currency for each Is. gold (i.e., that the value of £1 gold has become equivalent to o dollars and 70 cents), the amount of royalty on each ton net weight of crude oil will then be 1 dollar and 4 cents. Article 12. Ii the Company extracts, stores and sells any kind of mineral oil, it should pay to the Government a royalty equivalent to one-eighth of the revenue from sales. ^Nevertheless, it is understood that the Company is not bound to extract, stor e and sell any mineral oil, and it is also understood that the Company is not bound to pay any royalty in respect of the oil which will be used by the Company for its ordinary work, machines and other establishments in the Saudi Arab Kingdom. Article 13. Ihe Government have the right, through representatives properly authorised on their behalf, to inspect during working hours the work carried out by the Company, in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, and to check the quantities produced. Ihe Company should keep correct accounts and measures ^ quantities of oil gained and stored and which run from the depot of the neld, m accordance with the practice observed in the first-class oil-fields. Government representatives who are properly authorised have the right to check the said accounts at all convenient times. After the expiration of one half-year as from the date on which the oil is discovered in commercial quantities, the Company should submit to the Government a half-yearly account within a period o three months following the said half-year, and submit a statement showing the amount of royalty due to the Government for that half-year. The Govern- ment should treat these accounts and statements as confidential, with the exception ot figures which the Government may find it necessary to publish for certain financial purposes. The royalty which will be due to the Government should be paid at the end of each half-year, as from the date on which oil is discovered cpmmeicicil quantities, and such payment should be made within the period ot the three months following that half-year. In the case of any dispute which ma} occur in respect of the amount of royalty due for a half-year, the Company o i i n . i over t0 tile Government within the fixed period that part of the 10}a t\ w ich is not m dispute. Ihe dispute which may arise between the two parties should be settled by them, and if they do not come to a settlement in this way, then such dispute may be settled by means of arbitration provided for in is agreement. Any amount which will be decided after this settlement should be paid to the Government within sixty days, as from the date on which the decision is given.Article 14. It is agreed that all gold payments provided for in this agreement, whether they are gold pounds or shillings, will be reckoned on the basis of gold pounds, and in accordance with their weight and pureness at the time of payment. It is also agreed that payments may be made in American dollars or pounds sterling on the above-mentioned basis. It is also agreed that in case the payment of the loan and the rent for the first year is made in pounds sterling or American dollars, the rate will then be calculated in accordance with the rate of exchange on the date of payment. Article 15. All payments provided for in this agreement and which ought to be paid to the Government should be paid to them direct or to their credit in whatever bank they may fix in writing. The Government have the right to change this bank from time to time provided that they inform the Company of such action in writing, so as to enable the Company to have sufficient time to arrange for subsequent payment to the new bank. It is agreed that the Government shall select this bank, whether in Saudi Arabia, or in the United States of America, or in England, or in Holland, provided that no bank be selected in Saudi Arabia, unless it has a correspondent in the United States of America, England or Holland, through whom the money can be remitted to Saudi Arabia, and if the Company pays in the proper way to the Government any payment through the bank or through the correspondent of the bank for the purpose of its transmission to Saudi Arabia, the Company will be then free of any risk in respect of such payment. It has been agreed that the first payment agreed upon (which is the preliminary loan and the rent of the first year) should be paid within a period of fifteen days as from the date on which this agreement comes into force to the correspondents of the Netherlands Trading Society of Jedda (Saudi Arabia) at New York or London for its transmission and handing over to the Government against proper and correct receipt. The expenses incurred in this connexion will be charged to the Company. If this first payment is not paid in gold it may be paid in pounds sterling at the rate of exchange at the time the Company pays the said payment to the correspondent of the bank. Article 16. After discovering oil in commercial quantities within a reasonable period, the Company may choose a place in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of establishing a factory for manufacturing a sufficient quantity of petrol and kerosene to suffice the needs of the Government. It is understood that the requirements or needs of the Government will not include the sale of the same on their part inside or outside the country. The Company should proceed to establish this factory after completing the necessary preliminary arrangements and after obtaining the approval of the Government regarding the place which the Company suggests. During every year following the establishment of this factory the Company should offer to the Government a loose quantity of about 200,000 gallons of petrol and another of about 100,000 gallons of kerosene free of charge. It is understood that the methods of taking over these quantities should not expose the work of the Company to any danger. Article 17. The Company employs at its own expense the number of guards and guides needed for the protection of its representative camps and establishments. The Government promise to afford every assistance to the Company in supplying it with their best soldiers and men and entrust them with this matter. The Government will offer the Company all reasonable protection at certain wages, which will not be more than the usual wages paid by the Government. It is understood that the expenses incurred in connexion with such services should be paid to the Government by the Company. Article 18. In return for the obligations undertaken by the Company in pursuance of this agreement, and in respect of the payments which are due from the Company [879 q—5] b 3{) as provided for in this agreement, the Company and the concession will be exempted from all direct and indirect taxes, dues, charges and fees (includino- customs dues on export and import).

The commandeering of the means of transport and communi cations belonging to the Company by the Government during the occurrence of national trouble will entitle the Company to reasonable compensation for any loss which it may undergo or for any harm which may occur to the works and establish ments of the Company or hinder or embarrass its works. Article 20.

P.Z.6658/33. Note of a conversation with Mr. Ballantyne of the Bahrein Petroleum Company at the India Office on 17th October, 1933. Mr. Ballantyne had asked for an interview in connection with the Bahrein Petroleum Company's desire to secure an extension of their prospecting licence. 2. He said that he had now received instructions from San Francisco which were to the effect that the Company was not prepared to make an out and out payment to the Sheikh of Bahrein in return for an extension of their prospecting licence. They regarded that extension as their right. At the same time they recognised that the Sheikh might be in some financial difficulty and Mr. Ballantyne's instructions were in these circumstances that they would be prepared (though not specifically in return for the grant of the desired extension) to assist him by making a loan, recoverable from Royalties. The amount of the loan was for consideration by the figure suggested by San Francisco was Rs.50,000. This Mr. Ballantyne thought too low to be likely to attract the Sheikh and, subject to the course of our conversation, he would be prepared to recommend an increase to either Hs.l lakh or Rs. 150,000. There would be no objection to the amount in question being made partly payable to the private purse of the Sheikh and partly to the Government of Bahrein. 3. I said that as Mr. Ballantyne was aware we did/- 2 - did not recognise that the Company had. any right to a further extension and that while it was no doubt important J .kmt to save their face on this point in any understanding which might be reached in the matter, His Majesty's Government saw no reason for modifying their view as to the right of the Company to the extension in question. Any arrangement reached between us must take account of this and there could be no question of our recognising in any way that the Company had any right in the matter As regards the figure suggested, I agreed that Rs»50,000 would be unlikely to attract the Sheikh - Rs.150,000 might be more likely. As regards the private purse I thought there was much to be said in any payment made for allotting (as in the previous proposals put forward by Major Holmes) a proportion of the total to the Sheikh's private purse. The proportion in the previous offers had been 50% but the position was different now as the Company were not offering a. lump sum but a loan, recoverable from Royalties. Mr. Ballantyne would not overlook in this connection that a loan to the Sheikh 1 s private purse would be much less attractive to His Excellency that a gift and that there might also be difficulty later about securing its repaymen The Company might be well advised from their own point of view to so word their offer that any loan made to the Sheikh's private purse would be a loan in name only and would not in fact be repayable, 4. Mr. Ballantyne .said that he would be quite willing to suggest a figure^ of Rs. 150,000 to the Company/Company, two-thirds to be a loan to the State repayable from royalties, one-third to be for the private purse of the Sheikh without expectation of repayment. After considerable discussion on the question of the right of the Company to an extension he suggested as a compromise that the Company should ask for an extension of thirteen months. This would save the fs.ce of all parties. The Company were admittedly not entitled to an extension of 15 months (as distinct from 12)/, and if they wished for it must therefore be prepared to pay for it. I said I thought that this was the best way out of the difficulty. 5. Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company regarded it as important that the negotiation should be handled through the Chief Local Representative. I said we agreed entirely as to this. We had no desire to short-circuit the Chief Local Representative in any way. At the same time we should be grateful if the Company wouH keep us in close toucii at this end with any developments in Bahrein or any instructions sent by them to the Chief Local Representative. This might assist to smooth matters and avoid misunderstand- ings. Mr. Ball antyne said he hsb very glad to do so. He remarked in conclusion that the Company were anxious that the Sheikh should not receive prior information of the possible intentions oi tne Company and that his first information should come from,the Chief Local Representative. J.G.LAITMAITE. India Office, 17th October 1933.P.Z. 6727/55. Note of conversation with Mr.Ballantyne of the Bahrein Petroleum Conpany at the India Office on Thursday, 19th October. Mr.Ballantyne asked for an interview consequent on the receipt of instructions frcrn his principals in San Francisco in regard to the extension of the Bahrein Petroleum Canpany's prospecting license. 2. Ke said that as a result of his interview of 17th October he had telegraphed to San Francisco suggesting that an offer might 'be made to the Shaikh of Rs.150,000 in return for a 15 month extension of the prospecting license, one-third of the amount in question to be for the Shaikh's private purse without expectation of repayment and the balance a loan to the State recoverable fran royalties. San Francisco had, however, instructed him in reply that they did not wish to go beyond PvS. 1 lakh. The Company had further thought it well with a view to reaching a decision as to the offer to be made, to endeavour to ascertain from Major Holmes the approximate present private indebtedness of the Shaikh. Major Holmes had informed them that he estimated this at about Rs.10,000, that in his opinion a present of Rs.12,500 to the Shaikh would take him out of his difficulties; and that a gift so large as Rs.25,000 would best be i paid in instalments if excessive expectations were not to be aroused in the Shaikh's mind. 5. The London representatives of the Company, after consideration of the matter, in the light oi tneir instructions from San Francisco and of the information received/ CCCTIDBFi'IA L. DTD IA OF iaGS.57 ^O-t&gt; r MH) 0^0 Jt 2. received from Maj or Ho lines, had now decided to instruct Mr. Skinner by telegraph to submit to the Shaikh an offer of a loan of Rs.l lakh in return for an extension by 13 months of the Company's prospecting license. Rs.75,000 of this amount would be a loan to the Bahrein Government, recoverable from royalties, the balance of Rs.25,000 would be for the private purse of the Shaikh and would not in practice be recoverable . Mr. skinner woulci, nov/eveo. , ^e g,i v eu. discretion to suggest- to tne Snaiiui in wxiau manner the loan to his private purse should be paid whether e.g. in the form of a lump sum of Rs.10,000 down and the remainder by a series of monthly instalments. 4. Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company had consulted Major Iiolmes, as explaineu. a do -tq , in view of his knowledge of local conditions. They had not, of course, given him any information as to their relations with the India Off ice, which tneiy uiiou^ny it undesirable that he should know anything abouu. 5, I said that the Company's offer was of course one for the Shaikh to consider. It was only fair to point out to Mr. Ballantyne at x-ne same oime that the Shaikh was being asked to give a very valuable consideration in return for the sum now suggested by the Company. It was obvious that ii 'cne Company, as the result of this further extension of their prospecting license, were aole uo saci^j-^ themselves, e.g. that they could cover wiuhin tne 100,000 acres to be taken up. by them under their mining lease all the material oil-bearing portions of Bahrein/3. Bahrein, not only would they probably have no interest in the balance of the island but there would be nothing left which would be likely to interest the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. On the other hand, if they were required to take out a mining lease at the moment it would be open to the Shaikh to negotiate both with them and with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in respect of a concession ever the remaining area of Bahrein. Further, the grant of an extension to the Company would of course postpone the increased royalties which would become payable to the Shaikh under the mining lease. These must all be factors in any decision reached; so far as we were called upon to advise the Shaikh it would of course be necessary for us to bear in mind all factors relevant to the safeguarding of his interests. 6. Mr. Ballantyne said the Company wanted to v. — — - — avoid bargaining in Bahrein. After all there was probably not much doubt now how the oil-bearing structure lay. In any case, they remained of opinion that they were entitled as of right to an extension of a; year. I said that we had already made the position clear to . the Company as regards the refusal of a further extension, and that in our view the Shaikh in refusing it had acted entirely within his rights. On the matter of bargaining the earlier sum named by him had seemed to me to be one more likely to appeal to the Sheikh and so reduce the prospect of bargaining. But the matter was one for the Shaikh to consider. ;( ua Office % October 1933. (Set.) J. Gr.

I am awaiting the ^hall&lt;h # 8 reactions to the American offer. In the meantime, however, I have the following remarks to wake. ,3 lease refer to paragra5 of the first Note. ^r. Ballantyne said that the Comuan- regarded it as important that the negotiation should be handled throu#i the Chief Local Representative. I said we agreed entirely as to this. # I an not quite sure whether this weans that the negotiations should be handled (a)on the suot, i.e. at Bahrain, rather than in London, by the Chief Local Representative with the Shaikh, through the Political Agent, or (b) on the spot by the Chief Local Representative with the Shaildi, without the intervention of the Political Afrent. If (a) there is, of course, no objection. If (b) then 1 cannot agree to this procedure and- Loch concurs in ray opinion. Our i#iole at tit tide has been that ^he Chief Local Representative should not deal direct with the ^hal5di, but through the 'olitical Agent, and one of our eowplalnts against Holines (adfcnjap^ dinner• s predecessor) was that he had broken one of the tenas of his appointment by direct dealings. In this particular case/ •Leithwaite Esquire, ^he India Office, London•case Bkinndr, vide le»lde«ey tinted letter Ho•1755-^ dated the J?7th October 1935, quite correctly put his proposition through the Political Agent, hut t would he grateful if thia point could he cleared up. 3. lease see paragraph 6 of second Note. It is all very ^ell for Ballantyne to oay that 11 the Goinpany wanted to airold bargaining in BahrainV ^hia - if I may use the earoression • i® flapdoodle. Th» Company very rightly wishes to make the best bargain they can for themselves: in fact they have, in my opinion, already begun barr»ainin|? # vide the ^s. 150,000/- as against la# 100,000/-, mentioned in para graph S of the second Note. 1 am pretty sure that if pressed they will go up to ^s f 150,000/- (or perhaps even more), and, of course, it is our business as * trustees * for the ^halk 1 , to get as much out of them as we can. 4. Personally I do not see ^hat the Shaikh's indebtedness (paragraph S of second Hote) has to do with the Company's offer. This must surely be based on the merits ofjbusiness and technical aspects of the case. 6. Time is short as the Company's Prospecting Licence expires on the Snd December, and they have only just put in their proposal. They will most probably try to 'rush 1 the Shaikh and ourselves, but this will have to be resisted. The matter is a complicated one, and ^ood terms, I think, can only be secured for the Shaikh after careful consideration and ♦bar^ainlnn*. 'fcssibly if negotiations were not concluded by the Snd December, the Shaikh could extend the Prospecting liieence for a short period of a month or so, '♦without prejud ice' 1 , and as a favour to the Company, to enable an Agreement to be arrived at? t/■CONFIDENTIAL.
