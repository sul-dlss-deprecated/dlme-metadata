The British Consulate, Muscat. December 5, 1949. Consulate Guard. beginning to exercise the mind of the Commandant, Muscat Levies, and I think will shortly be taken up by His Highness the Sultan. As you know, guards are very wasteful in troops, and it takes half the strength of the whole .Muscat force 5 to supply the present number of guards, on the palace, bank and Consulate with serious repurcussions upon their training and efficiency. The Commandant cannot for example even get enough men together to do any manoeuvres or useful field training. The question would become even more acute were any more Consulates or banks to open. With regard to the bank, I think the lAiscat Government are trying to get round their agreement whereby they are bound to supply a guard, by substituting armed irregular levies or something. The Palace guard naturally cannot be ^reduced (it is only six men now) or abolished. But, since we no longer }?ave a Treasury here, and have just got rid of the 4^ lakhs of rupees waiting despatch to the Reserve Pank of India, there would not seem to be much of a case for keeping a guard on the Consulate. As there is a Bank, we keep little money on the premises, we have safes which no local thief could possibly break into, and we also have adequate private servants and Government farashes always on the premises. The Consulate is, moreover, situated in a built up area, where no raid or dacoity could well take place. From a point of view of security therefore I can personally see no necessity for a guard at all. The only other consideration is one of prestige, and in my view I can see no loss here either. Owing to the climate the guard has to be mounted right inside the building, and to me the only difference the absence of the guard would make would be the welcome removal of a noisy nuisance. Actually the men are smart and well behaved, and I have no complaint on that score, but care of my body at such close quarters is, I find, rather trying. However this may be, and a successor might take a quite different view, the fact remains that we do not pay for the guard, the .^Aiscat Government have strong reasons for wishing to discontinue it, and if they do tackle us on the point it would be difficult to resist, unless we are prepared to incur the considerable cost of it. Hence I would prefer to write now to the Muscat Government, saying that with the abolition of the Treasury here, we no longer require a guard, and with appropriate thanks for its supply for so long, suggest that^they might now like to withdraw it. % flag would continue to be hoisted and lowered, as hitherto by the senior farash on duty, morning and night. I shall be grateful to know what you think of this proposal. Yours sincerely. His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.K., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain . ?4B(9 CONFIDKNTIAI).

If copies of the report were forwarded to you with the know ledge and approval of the Sultan and you see no objection on other grounds, would you kindly take up with him the question of making the Mus cat Infantry adequate for the purpose of defence against a tribal attack, either by increasing its strength or by reducing the number of guards and duties for which it is responsible.PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, C OFF IDF NT IA I* No. 59 BAH1UIN (53/35/49) July, 1949* I have the honour to forward herewith &amp; copy of the Annual Report on the Muscat Infantry for 1948. fee do not appear to have received copies of this Annual Report previou sly and I do not know If ^ajor Greenwood forwarded copies of this report to the Political Agent with the knowledge and approval of the Sultan. 2. It will he seen that Major Greenwood says that most of the recruits come from Mekran, by which he means that portion of -ekr&amp;n which Is now under the jurisdiction of the Pakistan Government. It appears possible that this source of supply will dry up as I believe the Pakistan Govern went are not permitting their subjects to accept military service abroad and I have been told that a number of Mek- ranls who have proceeded to their homes on leave have failed to return. As a result, some recruitment is now being car ried out from Arabs living on the Batlnah Coast. 3. The small number of men available for the defence of Muscat in the event of a tribal attack is disquieting and I am asking the Political Agent to discuss this aspect of the report with the Sultan if he can do so without a breach of . confidence.

The correspondence, which is mainly between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain, discusses concerns expressed by the Commandant of the Muscat Infantry regarding the supply of officers to the Infantry. With a small number of men available to defend Muscat against possible attack, the Political Agent suggests to the Political Resident that the Muscat Agency and Consulate should offer to dispense with its Infantry guard.
