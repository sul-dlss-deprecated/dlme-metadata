To turn no« to Hr.Skrine’s second note on the question of the delimitation of the frontier. ^r.Skrine has dealt with this matter in considerable detail and it is unnecessary' for me to say more than that 1 agree entirely with his conclusion that it is not ir our interests to propose demarcation of the border between Ki 11a Sufaid and Koh-i-Bialik 3iah. Since we have much to lose and nothing to gain this is a matter which should be left dormant as long as possible/;Question of delimitation of the Indo-Perso frontier between Kila Safed and Koh-i-Malik Siah. • ••••• $ At the Zahedan conference Col.Daly, Major Pybus and I agreed that it would be inopportune to raise the question of the delimitation of the frontier, for reasons which I will explain below. 2. On my way to Zahedan I made a careful study of the following printed papers of which I was given copies by the Government of India:- (1) The Holdich Agreement dated 24th March 1896. (2) Col.Holdich*s letter No.77-T.H. dated 23rd June 1896 with enclosed maps. (3) Colonel McMahon's memorandum dated 5th November 1904 on the Perso-Baluch boundary question (Mirjawa to Koh-i-Malik Siah). (4) Foreign and Political Department confidential file No.214-N, Serial Nos.l to 173, on the Perso-Baluch frontier. The following remarks are based upon my study of the above documents, ray personal acquaintance with the section of frontier in question extending over the last 14 years and my investigations and discussions with Col.Daly and Major Pybus on the spot in February last. 3. Holdich's 'blue line' definitely, in ray opinion, leaves Padaha post, now known as Kila Safed, in Persian territory ana is also open to the objections pointed out by McMahon in para. 13 of his memorandum dated 5th November 1904. In 1905 Sir A.Hardinge concluded an agreement with the Persians which practically secured us Kila Safed (in return for relinquishing an imaginary5. i * imaginary claim to Mirjawa), but laft Holdich’s 'blue line' in the north. That line was, and still is, quite favourable to us as far as Kacha Kuh, but the straight line which had been drawn from that point to Koh-i-Malik Siah was clearly recognised to be most inconvenient from the strategic point of view. In 1912 the Government of India 'interpreted the fiiatUfi as meaning the then existing conditions of occupation by other side and considered Col.McMahon * s red line as roughly representing the limits of British occupation'. At that time, the Chagai authorities had Si 'v a M orders not to permit any trespass between the-w*4~ and blue lines. The Persians were then claiming Kacha and Piran, but it was considered that a delimitation of the whole frontier would be 'most inopportune' as the Government of India believed that they could deal with the matter locally. 4. The next time this section of the frontier came into the news was in 1931 when, owing probably to their annoyance at our withdrawal of the railway service, the Persians again began trespassing in the direction of Juzzak and also of Kacha and Piran in the northern section. The Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan and H.M's Consul in Sistan (Col.Daly) at first pressed for demarcation, but afterwards thought better of it, and by November of that year all concerned were agreed that it was advisable to avoid raising the frontier question until a formal application for the appointment of a boundary commission was made by the Persian Government. Kven if there nx were further incursions into the disputed territory on the part of the local Persians officials, these were to be dealt with on the spot and if possible officially ignored.5. In February 1932, however, H.M’s Minister Tehran reported that the Persian Government had sent a Survey Party to Duzdap and that the minister for Foreign Affairs had asked whether the Government of India would be ready to send a similar party immediately to delimitate the frontier before the hot weather. .In his despatch No*59 dated loth March 1932 H.M’s Minister explained the Persian Governments reasons for raising the question of delimitation. They considered it essential, owing to certain ambiguities and differences of opinion which existed as to the 1871 Agreement, to re-demarcate those parts of the frontier on the basis of that Agreement. The Indian authorities were alleged to have made certain encroachments, the opinion of the Persian Government being that Piran and Kacha as well as Kila Safed should be in Persian territory. After discussion with the Government of India and H.M's Minister Tehran the Horae Government agreed to a fresh delimitation of the frontier near Mirjawa, and if the Persians wished it up to Koh-i-Malik Siah, on the basis of the Holdich Agreement. Fortunately the Persians sent no plenipotentiary with their survey party, so we did not send one either and no delimitation actually todk place. The Persian surveyors did very little work in the field and practically all the surveying was done by Captain Bamford, who with the approval of Government gave the Persian party a copy of his map. The question of demarcation was once more dropped by both sides. 6. In this connexion I may mention that when the Home Government asked for our views on the 'red line', - and enquired whether Persians trespass was still banned between the red and blue lines, the Agent to the Governor General replied that owing to the abandonment of the tradetrade route Col.McMahon's objections to the blue line had lost much of their force, and that even if one or more of our present frontier posts were found to fall within Persian territory this would be unimportant from the territorial point of view. Our ban on Persian trespass between the red and blue lines had however been enforced on occasion, and our claim to it might still be said to be maintained. 7. Egqqft nt sitUfttipfl. This is very much the same as in 1912 and 1932. !• still hold Kila Safed, to which the Persians seem to have dropped their claim. The country between the red and blue lines is still regarded by our tribes and levies as British territory; it is occasionally patrolled by our levies, and no trespass by Persians is allowed. The Persians as a matter of fact are thoroughly frightened of penetrating into this wild mountainous region, their line of posts (even during the present effective military occupation of the Sarhad) practically coinciding with the Hormuk- Mirjawa motor road. The track from Robat to the main road is maintained by our levies for at least 3 miles west of the fort, instead of the 2552 yards calculated by McMahon as being the distance between his red line and the Robat fort. The track regularly used by our levies between Kacha and Piran goes via the Kacha Pass and Bug, both of which points are well to the west of the blue line. Moreover, Captain Bazalgette who used this route only last week when visiting Piran and Lar reports that the frontier is regarded as being at least 3 or 4 miles further west still — that is to say practically along McMahon's red line. In this connexion I may mention that the incident of the shoot ing of a Chagai Levy by Persian guards near Robat in January&amp; ^ January last actually took place on the Persian side of the 'red line'. My investigations on the spot in February last showed that the two Chagai levies were not more than 2i miles east of Shamedar post on the . main road when they fell in with the Persian frontier guards. The red line is here fully 4 miles east of Sharaedar. 8. It seems to me that for exactly the same reasons as in 1912 and 1932 we should Lo nothing to disturb the fliaiua_(iua or provoke the Persians to enforce their claim to Kila Safed and the country up to the blue line, We may be able to keep Kila Safed, on the basis of the 1905 Agreement and of long occupation; but to a Persian claim to the territory up to the 'blue line' i there could be but one answer. We would have to hand it over to them and assist them in occupying x£ it if they wanted to. This would entail (1) Handing over to the Persians grazing - and asafoetida- collecting grounds which are of considerable value to our Peki and Ismailzai tribesmen - admittedly few in numbers, but none the less British subjects who will bitterly resent its being abandoned by us. (2) Losing a valuable line of communications between the Kacha, Piran and Lar posts including the important Bug spring. Our only access to Piran and Lar would then be by the kirtaka-Robat road along the north-east foot of the hills, which would entail long detours for the Ghagai Levy reliefs and patrols going to and from Piran and Lar posts. (3) Losing the water supply of Lar post, which is a spring immediately to the south of peak 6016. (4) Rendering Robat post almost untenable owing to the close proximity of the Persian frontier (423 yards). This i/This salient is already too sharp for effective occupation, and the situation would be worse if a possibly hostile power occupied up to within a quarter of a mile the post. C.P.Skrine, I.C.S.

If, on the other hand, the railway is to be operated once more as far as Zahidan, or if in the alternative, the choice of the terminna f.,n Juzzak (Taftan), then clearly the Political Agentl line is prXrable Aa°I have said before it is impossible to conceive of Nok Kundi being the permanent failway terminus and if the terminus is to be put foward to the frontier then FOric cN 3t; .•Tuzzftk (Tnftan) is the obvious place for it; It becomes necessary to interpolate here a few remarks about the water supply of Juzzak. Hitherto the railway authorities have held that the water at this point is too salty to be used in railway engines and it has also been assumed that it is not fit for permanent human consumption. This postulate I venture to doubt. Experience elsewhere has shown that a few month’s steady pumping of water from any initially salty source tends to remove the salt from the soil, and it is most desirable in my opinion that before coming to any decision on the location of the railway ter- minus, an experiment of this nature should be made with the w*ater sources both at Juzzak and Mnkak, a few’ miles north of the Railway. The Political Agent in Kalat has suggested that an agreement might be effected with the Persians to enable us to take water from the Mirjaw’a supply and this is another possibi lity worth consideration, though the previous attitude of the Persirins in regard to our taking w’ater from their supplies has not been generous. In any event I w’ould not suggest that Persian complaisance on this particular point should be a deciding factor on the question of frontier rectification. 5. Apart from the possible water difficulty, the Political Agent’s proposed line is, equally with His Majesty’s Minister’s line (a), free from objection and has the advantage that it makes better use of topographical features. Either line^will have little or no effect on our tribes as the population concerned is in finitesimal and almost wholly of the Reki tribe, the greater part of which already lives in Persian territory, wdiile their Sardar is a Persian subject. The only place of any Value to us which w T ould be involved in the cession of territory fol lowing the adoption of either line is Racha, and as has been pointed out before there is already doubt whether Kacha lies wnthin British or Persian territory under the terms of Holdich agreement. Copy of a coxfidenttal letter from the Political Agent, Kalat, to the Sf.cj RETARY TO THE Hon’bLE THE AgENT TO THE GoVERNOR-GeNERAL AND CHIEF 1 Commissioner in Baluchistan, No. 264-C., dated the 8th August 1932. With reference to your Express letter No. 418-S., dated the 23rd June -1932, I have the honour to report as follows. 2. I have considered the alternative proposals • put forward by His Majesty’s Minister Tehran in the light of my own local knowledge and of the attached report by the Assistant Political Agent ; Chagni, who at my request consulted the Sinjranis, Rekis and other inhabitants of the area concerned during his visit to Nok Kundi last month. ’ 3. In the opinion of Captain Cox and myself, the line (b) proposed by His Majesty’s Minister is open to the following objections :— (i) It includes in Persia an area which geographically does not belong to the Sarhad, the “ frontier province ” of Persia. (it) It leaves us with a featureless border-line and a bad frontier station, Nok Kundi. («u) It gives Persia part of what may one day prove a valuable mineral field, namely the volcanic area between Sornehan Knh (4000 A ) and Knh-i-Malik (3048 A ) which abounds in such minerals aS bauxite, kaolin and sulphate of alumina. 4. On the other band, His Majesty’s Minister’s line (o) has the following disadvantage, in addition to that pointed out bv His Majesty's Minister him self in paragraph 4 of his letter: the long and sharp salient involved would be no less difficult and expensive to, administer effectively than the existing one and w T onjd be of even less value to us, as it w’ould exclude the only reasonably habitable spot in the area, Kacha. 5. The line which I would suggest, if it is decided to rectify the frontier in such a way as to give Persia a substantial strip of territory, is the following From boundary pillar No. IT to the south-eastern end of the Kuh-i- Rihi, thence along the axis of this range to its north-westerrt end south of the railway at Juzzak. Thence to a point on the railway imme diately to the north-west of Kiih T i-Taftan station (wrongly marked Juzzak ” in the survey of India maps). Thence northwards via intersected points 5291 and 5514 to trig station 1881 north of Saindak. Thence almost due north to the Afghan frontier opposite Dardan well.This line gives an area of approximately 950 square miles to Persia, in- feluding the Kacha range with its north-eastern talus which belongs geograph ically to the Sarhad, while it leaves the relatively important levy posts of Saindak and Amalaf in British territory. It is easier to demarcate and some what more defensive than either of the alternatives. 6. So far as the scanty nomad population of the area is concerned, there is little to choose between my line and His Majesty’s Minister’s line (a). Only a few Rekis, whose Sardar Habibullah Khan of Ande (11 miles south of Mirjawa) is already a Persian subject and an officer in their Amnieh Police, are affected in either case. Line (b) would leave to Persia a stretch of desert shown on the map as belonging to the western Sinjrani tribe ; so far as it goes, this fact argues in favour of the line proposed by me above. 7. The question of which station on the railway is to be the terminus of the service, or the frontier station on our side if the service in Persian territory is to be resumed, is an important one and is closely connected with the present question. I shall address you separately on this subject in the near future. At present all I need say is that in my opinion Nok Kundi is entirely unsuitable both as a terminus and as a frontier station. Kuh-i-Taftan (Juzzak), opposite and reasonably close to Mirjawa ih Persian territory, is the obvious place, unless the railway service is to be still further curtailed and taken back to Dalbandln. Even so, a mo tor-road will have to be maintained up to the frontier, either along the railway line or along the old caravan-route ; in the former case Kuh-i-Taftan station, in the latter Saindak, will be preferable to Nok Kundi as our frontier post. The water difficulty at Kuh-i-Taftan could be easily dealt with by arranging with thei Persians, as part of the general agreement, to take water by pipe line from the excellent Mihjawa supply (brought by us from the Ladis stream during the War at enormous expense) eleven miles away. There is no supply of sweet water within 60 or 70 miles of Nok Kundi, so far as I know, ana a boundary line which obliged us to make that place our frontier station would therefore have grave disadvantages. . f Copy op a Nolfc, dated the 17th July 1932, recorded by the Assistant Political Agent, Kalat and Chagai. I have made enquiries through Sardar Taj Muhammad Sinjrani, Mir Muhammad Shariff Reki of Ladghast, Jemadar Khan Jan Jemaldini, of the Sohtagan garrison, and the Frontier Assistant, Mirjawa, and am informed that the majority of the sparse nomad population likely to be affected by the pro posed alteration of the Perso-Baluch boundary are Rekis. These Rekis are under the control of Sardar Habibulla Khan of Mirjawa, who is a Persian subject. The greater part of the tribe already live's in Per sian territory and a transference to Persia would have little effect on the British Rekis. Various other such as the Notzais, Shawazis and Zarazis are in such small numbers and so nomadic as to be unlikely to influence the question. In order to retain the comparatively important posts of Saindak, Amalaf, and Mukak Chah, I suggest that the boundary from Pillar No. 11 follow the line proposed by Tehran as far as Juzzak, thereafter to point 5291, 5813, 5514 and 1881 and thence to Dardan on the Afghan border. The territory thus con ceded to Persia would be of sufficiently imposing dimensions to serve the pur pose required. It is mostly mountainous or desert waste of no real vlaue.

Bomford, B.E., in-charge Perso-Baluch Bgcndart Party, Survey of India, to the Surveyor General of India No. 240 of 7th June 1932. I have the honour to submit the following report of my proceedings in con nection with the Perso-Baluch boundary between Pillar 11 and the Koh-i-M&amp;lik Siah. (1) In accordance with proposals made in telegram No. 704 of 4th March 1932, from the Government of India, to the Secretary of State [Serial No. (81)1, I was instructed as follows :— (а) To demarcate the boundary between the watershed of the Mirjawa Koh and the junction of the Tahlab and Mirjawa rivers, on the basis of the Holdich line, if agreement with the Persian representative /should be found possible. (б) To extend the demarcation to the Koh-i-Malik Siah, if the Persians should so wish. (2) As reported in my telegram No. 208 of 13th March 1932, to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan [Serial No. (114)], I met the Persian representative, Sartip Abdul Razzaq Khan, at Mirjawa on 13th March 1932, who informed that he was not authorised to demarcate, and that the Persian Government at present wished to confine Iheir operations solely to making a map of the area in which the boundary lies. I therefore proposed * to do the same, and have done so. • (3) The area which I have surveyed is shown on the attached Map No. X (Survey of India sheet No. 30, Scale 1 : 1,000,000). It is a' strip 15 to 5) miles wide from Pillar 11 to the Koh-i-Malik Siah through the centre of which the boundary runs. The scale of survey is 4 miles to one inch. I have also made a small map of the immediate neighbourhood of Mirjawa on the scale of 211 inches to one mile. T • • « (4) The Persian survey has been started on the larger scale of 1 : 100,000 (about II miles to one inch), and has not progressed very well. The . area covered up to 11th May 1932 is also shown on Map No. I. In flat ground the Persian map has a satisfactory appearance, but the Persian surveyors do not know how to draw hills, and up to 11th May 1932 they were hardly attempting to make a serious map of the hill areas. Sartip Abdul Razzaq expressed the intention of completing the whole remaining area between Mirjawa and Koh-i- Malik Siah during the last three weeks of May, but he will certainly not have been able to do so with any fidelity. I presume that he was relying on copying our old degree sheets, or our new map, if I send it to him before he has to submit his map to the Persian Government. (As authorised in Hon’ble Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan’s No. 316-S. of 5th May 1932) [See Serial Nos. (129) and (132)]. He expects to recess in Tehran this summer, or possibly to work on the Turkish frontier, and to return to Baluchistan next winter to complete his survey down to Pillar 11. (5) I have had no discussion with Sartip Abdul Razzaq on the subject of where the boundary should lie, but as I have had the opportunity of seeing the ground and considering the subject for some time, I submit my opinion in the attached appendix.

The Perso—Baluch Boundary from Pillar 11 to the Koh-i-Malik Siah. (1) I understand it to be accepted that the basis of the present boundary is tiie line agreed on by Colonel T. H. Holdich, R.E. and Mirza Ali Ashraf in 1896. The section now referred to is described in the last three sub-paras, of their agreement, and is illustrated in the map which they attached to it. ‘ In the agreement certain topographical features, (e.#., the Tahlab river) are rferred to by name, and in interpreting the agreement two courses are possible, vie. :— (a) To try to determine which topographical features are known to the Baluchis by the names given in the agreement : t.e., to try to follow the agree ment literally. or (b) To try to determine to which actual topographical features the Commissioners were intending to refer. In view of the difficulty of correctly determining place names in an almost uninhabited country, the above two courses do not necessarily lead to the same result. In the present case course (b) can be followed with very little doubt, and it leads to a reasonable and satisfactory boundary, while course (a) leads to contradictions and difficulties. The points which have to be decided are :— (a) Where is the junctions of the Tahlab and Mirjawa rivers t (b) Which point on the watershed of the Mirjawa range is nearest to this junction. (c) Which is the main watershed between the Mirjawa range and the Kacha Koh T (2) Naming of Topographical Features. —It must be understood that the European and Indian system of naming topographical features is not the same as that used in Western Baluchistan. The European practice is to give a river a single name from its mouth to the source of its principal tributary, or alternatively to some junction where it splits into two principal tributaries. In this area, on the other hand, rivers are seldom given one name throughout any considerable length of their ootirse. Every small hill-valley has its own name, but in flat ground a separate name is given to every point where there is water or grazing or any other prominent feature, and intermediate stretches of dry river-bed are left unnamed. (3) Mirjawa—Tahlab junction. —In the case of the Mirjawa and Tahlab rivers, I should say (although this point of view may not be generally accent ed) that there is no river which the Baluchis name Mirjawa, and no river named Tahlab. Mirjawa is an inhabited place, and Tahlab is a salt swamp and jungle. A dry watercourse flows through these places, but I think it is locally known simply as the rud (=^ Persian river). If it is necessary to distinguish it from any other rud, it may be described as the Mirjawa rud or Tahlab rud, these being well known localities through which it passes, but I would here regard the words Mirjawa and Tahlab as descriptive adjectives rather than as names, and I think either adjective is perfectly appropriate throughout the whole length of the river.* Even if the above point of view cannot be admitted, it is certainly correct to say that the limits of the sections which might be known as Mirjawa and Tahlab are extremely indefinite, and in any case there is a locality called Reg-i-Malik which includes part of the river bed between Mirjawa and Tahlab, so that the sections (if any) known as Mirjawa and Tahlab, do not meet. If it is to be insisted on that the Mirjawa and Tahlab rivers must be con sidered to meet, the nearest approach to a meating place is Reg-i-Malik (see map 2, latitude 28° 45')- This is an absurd place from which to make the boundary leave the river bed, for the straight line from it to the Mirjawa watershed runs close to the river bed, which would form a much clearer boundary. Also, the map which accompanies the 1896 agreement shows the boundary following the river almost up to Mirjawa. If, on the other hand, abandoning literal interpretation, one accepts the view that tbe agreement uses river names in their European sense the diffi- culty largely disappear. The map shows which ri ver the boundary is to Mil my map I have given the names Mirjawa, Reg-i-Malik and Tahlab to different sections or the nver to avoid the inconvenience of having nvers with no names.3 4 follow, ttiid that it leaves the river where the latter curves away from the general line of the boundary near Mirjawa. Some doubt may be felt regard* ing the precise point at which the boundary should leave the river, but in my opinion the most natural point to accept is at the junction with the main bed i of the river from Ladis. This is an important tributary, the junction point is | fairly well defined, and the junction is close to the point where the westerly [ trend of the “ Mirjawa-Tahlab ” river would force the boundary to leave it. This point is about 300 yards below our post of Killa Safaid, which is conse quently just inside Persia. But judging from paras. 8 and 9 of the Foreign Office Memorandum of 23rd July 1931 (pages 3-4 of notes), Sir A. Hardinge’s agreement of 13th May 1905 may be held to amend Colonel Holdich’s agree ment to the extent of placing Kilia Safaid (= Padaha) inside British territory. (4) Nearest point on Mirjawa Koh watershed .—To determine the point on the watershed to which the boundary is to proceed in a straight line, the agreement specifies, ‘ (a) that it is on the Mirjawa Koh, and (h) that it is on the watershed which limits the drainage into the Mirjawa river. Considering the literal interpretation first, the attached map 2 shows the watersheds (in red), and also (in broken red) the outermost limit of the hill area which could possibly be held to be locally known as the Mirjawa. Koh. If the Miipawa river is considered to extend as far south as Reg-i-Malik or liasab, it is seen that very little of its limiting watershed lies on the Mirjawa Koh, and the nearest point is that marked A in map 2. This is an incon spicuous point, invisible from the south, and it is a very unnatural terminal for the length of the artificial straight line. The straight line from Reg-i- Malik to point A (shown in pencil in map 2) lies on the Baluch side of the river, so that from the point of view of territorial gain the literal interpreta tion is here slightly to the advantage of Persia. On the other hand, ignoring the literal interpretation, if the Mirjawa-Tahlab junction is considered to be just below Killa Safaid, as proposed in paragraph 4 above, the watershed limiting the drainage of the Mirjawa river (as now defined) is that ending at the point marked B in map 2, which consequently becomes the northern end of a short length of artificial straight line. THs would be a satis factory point to accept, and it reduces the length of artificial boundary to a minimum. ' ;*.T' (5) Main watershed to Kacha Koh.~-The difficulty in interpreting the “ main watershed northward to the highest point of the Kacha Koh” lies in the fact* that the watershed does not follow the main axis of the range, which carries the highest peaks, but runs along less conspicuous ridges to the west. In particular, the highest poiut of the Kacha Koh, which Colonel, Holdieh defines to be on the boundary, does not lie on the watershed. See map 2. In this section an attempt at literal interpretation is to the advantage of the Government of India, to the extent of about 100 square miles of country and the post of Kacha, which would otherwise become Persian. Colonel Holdich clearly intended the boundary to follow' the line of highest peaks In paragraph 15 pf his No. 77T of 23rd June 1896, to Government of India Prog No. 41 in S. E., October 1S96, Nos. 15—S3, he writes of the boundary south of the Kacha Koh as “ a rugged wall facing the eastern desert ”. This description is applicable to the line of high peaks (shown in continuous blue in map 2), but not to the true watershed. Further, the broken blue line in map 2 is the boundary as transferred from his (small scale) map. It shows that his map was not altogether accurate in detail, but .it distinctly follows the line of highest peaks rather than the watershed. ‘ If literal interpretation is required, tw'O courses are possible : • la) To follow the main watershed as far as Padagi Koh, and then the Pi™* 1 - Kacha watershed as far as the line ioimng the highest point of the Kaoha Koh to the Koh-i-Malik Siah. This proposal is shown in yellow in map 2. (M To accept for the south end of the straight line to the Koh-i-Malik Siah, the highest point on the watershed, instead' of the highest point of the Kacha Koh. This is P adagi K flh, 71)20^ I think this claim could hardly be pressed. 2 I X % «iColone If it is desired to claim territory now, in order to enhance the value of subsequent rectification, course (a) (the yellow line) might well be claimed as a reasonable mtcipretation of the Holdich agreement, not amounting to re-defini tion as proposed by Major MacMahon. But if the literal interpretation it enforced here, we might find it hard to avoid an attempt at literal interpretation between Beg-i-Malik and Mirjawa, and I think that the resulting boundary, although possibly well enough for a temporary settlement pending more exten sive changes, would not be at all a satisfactory permanent boundary. (6) Summary. —To summarise, my opinion of the correct interpretation of nel Holdich : s line is as follows :—(shown in continuous blue in map 2) (a) From Pillar 11 North-West along the centre line of the “ Tahlab- Mirjawa M river, as far as the junction with the main bed of the Ladis river, about 300 yards below Killa Safaid. (b) From this point the boundary should follow a straight line for about one mile north-east to the foot of the nearest spur of the hills. (c) From this point the boundary follows the local watershed through peaks 5805, 6956, 7157, 7180 and 7619, to the highest point of the Kacha Koh (7685), and thence in a straight line to the highest point of the Koh-i-Malik Siah. (7) Frontier Rectification.—I had received no instructions to consider the possibility of a considerable rectification of the frontier, but on my return to Quetta the Hon’ble the A. G. G. in Baluchistan mentioned this possibility. 1 am not in a position to express an opinion on the general principle, but the following details of the country involved may assist consideration of the ques tion :— (a) In map 1, the area shown in red is completely devoid of permanent water and is uninhabitable, except where water is brought by rail way, and except for short periods after very occasional heavy rain. On the other hand the hilly areas lying east and west between Koh-i-Sultan and Amalaf, and along either side of the present boundary, do contain a certain amount of water, and camels can be grazed there. Thus, to withdraw the frontier 10 miles is to give up nearly as much as is lost by withdrawing it considerably more. Except for levy and railway posts, I think there are no buildings or permanent habitations in the whole area. (5) Any British subject whose country is transferred to Persia will con sider himself very hardly treated. (c) Of the various lines which could be suggested for a new frontier, the only particularly natural one, that I can suggest, is the boundary of the Reki and Sinjrani tribal areas, which I understand to pass - roughly north and south through the Kob-i-Dalil (longitude 6*2® 10'), but I do not know' whether this represents a suitable amount of withdrawal (d) Between Mirjawa and Nokkondi there is no natural water supply on the railway line. A railway terminus or frontier post at any other place than Mirjawa would have to get all its water from Dalbandin. (Sd.)

Copy of a Confi denjtial Fo, 157-1/8, dated Zabul, the 15th April 1932, froih Hi e-vonaul, Siaten and Kain, to the 5breign Secretary to the 5overncent of India, Foreign snd Political Department, Simla* 1 1 ^ tir\ I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 156 of *T'th April 19 32 and to forward herewith the maps referred to, »vhi ch are no doubt already available but as I have two copies of ®ieet No. 14 N.W. I forward one in case it may be of use. Die Boundary Pillars Nos* 12 to 15 are clearly shown and the line finally merges in Pillar No. 186 at the junction of the Afghan, Persian and Indian frontiers at Kuh-i-lfalik Slab. I am not clear how these Pillars arp shown in the maps, whereas the Holdich agreement of 1896 makes no mention of them. 2* Die Persians are said to have collected evidence that our post at Kgcha has been advanced since the boundary was settled. In this connection it is interesting to note that there are two points marked Kacha Pass, one on either side of the border. I am unaware as to the exact location of our present Levy post in this neighbourhood. 3. Die gmall map (l* - 2 miles) which' accompanied the Tebb- lare observations on the ambiguity of the boundary near Hirjawa, made in his report on Quetta-Si stan Trade route for 1900 - 1901 is presumably available with the Government of Indie. If this be compared with Sheet 14 3.W. (adjoining afreet to the enclosed map) the ambiguity as regards the junction of the TALAB and LIRJaWa rivers is obvious. In Captain 'Tebb-Vare* s sketch the river-beds appear to be quite distinct in the neighbourhood of Hirjawa Port. Prom personal observations on the spot I am not convinced that thi# distinction is at all obvious. I have seen Rt i* ^6 spot in dry weather only, when no water was flowing and ^ere appears to be a general depression near the Port, in No 68 m. ! ^ which both the drainage of thelLirjaWa river and other drainage m.M from•— - ; ^ - 2 , 3 V 33 | 1 t'^32 J from the hills (whi ch--mi ^Tf*e construed as the source of the Tglsb river) vjould appear to mingle. In Sieet 14 S.TT. referred to above the Talab is clearly shown as e •Reach* of the 19. rj awe river, and I gather that the local inhabitants regard the • Talab 1 as originating in the Springs shown as Talab Spring on the map* If this be so, it may be concluded that a straight line from that point to •Ihe nearest point in Uirjawa Range* would in all probability place our present Lirjewa ?ort in Persian territory*Commandant, who went to Mirjawa, refused to permit the prmed members to enter until he obtained separate instructions frar Tehran.

T., dated the 4th March 1932. Your telegram of the 1st instant, No. 671 (above). My comments on Minister at Tehran’s letter are as follows :— (i) I agree with Minister’s interpretation of 1896 Agreement. Oijr contention is that frontier follows river called Talab or Mirjawa or Derigiaban to point somewhere north of Kila Safed which we maintain is indisputably in British territory. (ii) If Kila Safed is conceded to be in Persia I do not think that it is of any con sequence as until recently it has not been occupied much for years and is only of value to us as passport check ing station if railway remains closed. (iii) If point (gr. undec.) 7681 is taken as ( point referred to by Holdich as highest point of Kacha Koh K acha jx&gt;st and other portions of our~territory linight $ become Persian. This again I consider to be unimportant from territorial point of view since abandonment of trade route and even advantageous in saving us expense. The argument against it is loss of prestige in surren der to Persia of British territory and tribes who have regarded themselves a* under our protection. (iv) Our claim to permit no trespass between Red and Blue line has lost importance since opening of railway. (v) I agree that it should be left fer Persia to take initiative, but so long as rail way does not run beyond Nokkundi it is not so easy for our party to come and go from Quetta whenever Persians oease work as Minister appears to think. ^ 2 s— -L io * - w &lt;• I' O'M -r, , C ' C ' 0 no '4 2 M '* lc&lt;1 ' a 1932 3i MAR. 115?i k' SECRET tv C c/ MA B’HB/DT.

I presume duty cf '' ur survey party would be to try to arrive at agreement regarding debatable points in conjunction with Persian party, but their j^int or separate conclusions would of course be subject to negotiation and subsequent ratification. Ends.' Comments will follow.—a British Legation, ( Tehran. February 13th, 1932. I fear that my telegram No. 4 of the 7th February about: the demarcation of the Baluchistan frontier may give a great deal of trouble at a time when there* s already olenty. It is .lust like the Persians to soring their request tor a commission on us at short notice, and at any other time I should have been inclined to tell them that it was impossible for us to make the necessary arrangements in time. But with the general treaty negotiations on the point of coming to life again, I want to humour them if I can and for this reason I hope you will forgive my imoortunity. I am still without a large-scale sketch-map of the Mirjawa district, but so far as I can gather the demarcation of the frontier is not likely to affect us much one way or the other. The actual agreement of March 24th,1896, is pretty vague, but when read in conjunction with Colonel Holditch*s report of June 23rd,1896, and in the light of the general man attached to that report, iw seems to me clear that the commissioner intended the frontier to follow the line 1 that it does de facto to-day: in other words, if we give -Velyn Howe 11&gt; K.C.I.o*, C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, N1W DELHI. rI fe5/ give tiie nr me of X to the mr in stream that is called at different stages ' , Dfir-i-G•iab&amp;n , ' 'Mirjawa river'*, 'Reg-i-Malik river 1 * and 'Talah river' on sheets 30 G and 30 H of the 1' equals 4 miles map, the Con-mice - oners meant by the 'Talsh river' the ’..hole of -he river X to a -point north of the pi*3sent railway and meant by -he 'Mirjawa river' some small stream flov/ing into the river X north of the railway. This view is borne out by the terms of the agree- ment of M-y 13th,1905, by common-sense and by the existing state of affairs: and I hone that the British commission will, on these grounds, be able to maintain that the river (or riv^r-bx,, or nullah) between Mir^awa and Padaha (Kila Sefid) is, hi s been and shall be, the proper frontier. If, however, the Persians are able to prove that what is c.escribed in the agreement of March £4th,1896, as the 'point of junction' (of the Talsh and Mirjawa rivers) lies somewhere south ot the railway and .. e are therefore forced to acce-ot as the frontier a straight take to be the height marked '5939' on thus leaving Padha in Persian territory, i none nmu this would not be disastrous from our point ol view. Cater, at any rate, seems to think we can view the prosoect with equanimity. line joining this 'point of junction' to toe 'nearest point on the watershed o ' the Mirjawa^ I am not quite clear as to the position i'urther north. The Holditoh agreement is quite definite that the frontier is a straight line joining 'the highest point of Kacha Kuh' (which I take to he the height marked 'veer' on sheet 30 G) to Kul -i.-A.alik Siah, and this line may need demarcating, because there must be lots of points on the line from which it is inroossible to see both of its ends at once. So far so good. I see, however, from a Foreign Office memorandum on the Perso-Baluchistan frontier of July 23rd 1931 (of v .hich you doubtless received a copy) that in 1912 the Government of India regarded the agreement of 1905 as consecrating a state of affairs which made Colonel Me Mahon's ’’Red Line” the limits of British occupation. Do we still claim to 'nermit no trespass” in the area between the ”Red” and 'Blue” lines? In almost all former boundary commissions with Persia or Afghanistan, the initiative has lain with us, and the British Commissioners have, I believe, frequently been keut hanging about in the most exasperating way while their colleagues failed to appear, disappeared or awaited instructions from their Governments. In this case we are in a much stronger position: we are already in occupation of the natural frontier and it is the Persians who stand to gain something by any alteration. This 'something” is probably much less than they think, but that is beside the point. I am anxious that we should be able to \&gt; preserveI preserve this tactical advantage: in other words let I the Persians take all the initiative and do all the worrying: our part should, if -nossible he confined to a cordial collaboration in any measures they may suggest, provided of course that these measures do not amount to an attempt to revise the Holditch agreement. v The arrangements for the British Commission are outside my orovince, but may I suggest that it will be much easier to maintain our attitude of indifference if the British party are free, not only to continue the demarcation as long as the Persians like, but also to return to the comforts of Quetta whenever the Persians cease work and there wait until they hear that the Persians are ready to resume. In these d ys of railways, to say nothing of aeroplanes, it is possibly an easier matter to maintain as small Commission in the field than it was in Holditct^s day: and a much easier matter to withdraw them temporarily to Quetta. The details are of course for the Government of India to decide, but I do want to impress upon you that we shall lose much of the tactical advantage that we have gained from the fact that it is the Persians who have asked for demarcation if I have to keep urging the Persians to get a move on because Captain X is required for another job, or because the Commission’s supplies are running short. In such a case as the last, the Commission should simply retire.I have sent conies of this letter to Olphant and Daly, and, to save time, to Cater.

I tMre the honour to Inform you that tho following information baa boon raeaiTod from a aourea which la eonaldarad vary rallabia. Habib Ullah Khan, Hawab of Kharan, la aald to hara put in a claim to tba Paralan authorltlaa to the effect that practically the whola of Paraian Baluchi*tan la, or rathar waa prior to the recant aubjugatlon of the Baluchi* by the Central Government, under hi* rule. Ha la alleged to hare acme doc usentary avldenea to prove that hie Grand father Asad bald away over that area of country about fifty yeara ago. It la further reported that thie claim coming at a time when the Paralana are making every endeavour to aeoure the agreement of the Baluchi* to offer eridence that the original boundary between Persian and Brltlah Baluchistan ahould be considerably further Beat than that held by ua to be the true frontier, canned oon*lderable uneaalnea* in Tehran and ordera were aent to the General Officer CaMandlng (The Military Governor in Baluchlatan A the Sarhad) that he ahould endeavour either to meet the lawab paraonally, or eend a treated intermediary who ehould bo empowered te offer the lawab a aubatantial of money to withdraw the claim, (which perhapa they would find difficult to Ignore in view of their own claim* in other dlreetlona - aa for example the abaurd contention in connection with the Bahrain lalanda.) I have aleo learnt that the Pereiana are trying te 0 ollect evidence that the road eouthward from Kundi to Itekrtn&amp; Mekran and that northwards from the saw plaoe to Robat both pass through Parsian territory. In this connection it is known that the Cantonment Commandant at Zahidan received instructions to interrogate aged Baluchis in the Zahidan neighbourhood. He sent for two men from the following of Malik Muhammad Khan. One replied that he had no knowledge of the matter and the other stated that as far as he remembered the Persians had no jurisdiction anywhere in last Persia from Meshed downwards and that the Baluchis of Bast Persia were originally governed by Baslr Khan, Grandfather of Mahmud Khan, M awab of Kalat, and that the country was, at a later date subdued by Asa^LKhan, grandfather of Habib Ullah of Kharan, who actually oooupled the country, but soem after died at Kharan. Hie eon Nowroz Khan, being then a minor, mas remained in a state of independanoe until subsequently subdued by the Persians. ' The CoMoandant is said to have been much annoyed at this statement and to have heartily cursed his informant. It is further reported that the G.O.C. recently sent one Syed Alms Shah, a person muoh respected by the Tribesmen, to Persian Me kran and Chahbar to secure statements to the offset that the Mekran road, abovementloned, lies within Persian territory which extends to Koh*l»Taftan Railway station. Men have also been sent to Iransheher and various parts of the Barhad with the same object. Sardar Jmsa Khan, Ismailsai told a Consulate repre sentative that he had been asked by the G.O.C. to oollect evidenoe favourable to the Persians. The G.O.C. is also believed to have sent Ha lb Khalil Khan with three soldiers, all in civilian clothes, from Zahidan to PIRAK %XLA to collect statements. The General Officer Commanding has recently proceeded to Tehran ostensibly on leave, but there grounds for supposing that the reed, object of the vie it unable to enforce his rights is arele to dioouoo tho frontier question, which is almost certain to be shortly raised. Should negotiations take place in the future, it seems highly probable that the Persians will claim Tastly more than they expeet to get in the hope that some adrantage will accrue. It has occurred to me that the alleged claim of the Yawab of Khar an, which perhaps has already been brought to your notice, might be worth examining since however slender it may be it might well serre as a useful counterblast to Persian claims which are likely to be pro poets riae. It is interesting in this conneetion that the 0,0*0. ones remarked to ms, about two years ago, that be regarded the salient into Persian territory which our frontier forms at Kot^i-Xalik Slab as Tory undesirable for Persia, on Military grounds • A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to tho Oowemmsnt of India in tho Yoreign and Political Department and to His Majesty's Charge d'Affairea at Tehran (Yo,90), I hare, etc*, ftd.

P. Z./4388/31 and P. Z./4837/31 of July 11th and 31st, you sent us copies of certain correspondence regarding the possible demarcation of the Perso-Indian frontier near Mirjawa. I think you will find it useful to have the enclosed copy of a memorandum regarding the Perso- Baluchistan boundary which has been prepared by the Library. The memorandum refers to two alternative lines drawn on one of our maps by Major McMahon, the blue line being the Holdich line of 1896, and the red line an alternative line further west which, (if the Persians would only agree to it) would give us a more satisfactory boundary between Malik Siah Koh and Kacha Koh, north of Mirjawa. You will, however, see from paragraph 9 of the memorandum that an agreement was concluded with the Persian Government in 1905 by which the frontier was to be Aithwaite, Ksq. »be definitely settled in accordance with the Agreement of 1896, and by which, in other words, the Holdich line was confirmed. I fear that there can in present circumstances be no hope of inducing the Persian Government to agree 'to the slight rectification of boundary involved 'by the adoption of the red line' (Major McMahon's line). V/e presume that you will in due course hear further from the Government of India on this subject, and we are glad to note the suggestion in the Government of India s telegram of lath July that, if the Persians again raise the question of patrolling the railway line outside Mirjawa, an attempt is to he made to come to a working arrangement with them without prejudice to a settlement of the site of the frontier.By an agreement signed on December 27, 1895 Great Britain and Persia agreed to delimit the frontier between Kohak and Koh Malik Siah. The delimitation was to follow as closely as possible the line shown on the map attached to the agreement, with the accompanying memorandum. 2. Effect was given to the agreement of December 27, 1895 by a demarcation agreement concluded by Colonel Holdich on March 24, 1896. This demarcation agreement contains the following provisions Pillar 11 is on the edge of the right bank of the Talab watercourse, and about 1 mile east of the northern end of the Gorani date groves. Prom pillar 11 northwards the Talab river becomes the boundary to its Junction with the Mirjawa river. Prom the point of Junction it is carried by a straight line to the nearest point on the watershed of the Mirjawa range, which limits the drainage into the Mirjawa river on the north. Thence it follows the main watershed northward to the highest point of the Kacha Koh. Prom the highest point of the Kacha Koh the line is carried straight to the highest point of the Malik ^iah Koh. 3. In 1902 some trouble was caused by the establishment of a British post in the neighbourhood of Mirjawa, which the Persian Government held to be in Persian territory and where6. , where they were about to open a customs station. It was explained to the Persian Government that owing to the inaccuracy of the map on which the frontier line was drawn by the commissioners in 1896 some doubt existed as to the precise position of the boundary near Mirjawa, more especially as this portion was not at the time delimited on the spot. It was also suggested that further investigations on this point were desirable, but meanwhile instructions were given for the post established to be withdrawn to a position on territory which was indisputably British. 4. In a note dated April 6, 1902 Sir A. Hardinge suggested to the Persian Government that arrangements should be made for a demarcation on the spot of the frontier between pillar 11 and Koh-i-Malik oiah. In their reoly of May 14, 1902 the Persian Government agreed to appoint a Persian to meet a British official with a view to place boundary marks at the point where the river Mirjawa falls into the Talab and on the points north of the Mirjawa Mountains to Koh-i-Malik oiah, but they considered that from pillar 11 along the natural boundary line of the River Talab up to the point where the Mirjawa River falls into the Talab, no demarcation was necessary. 5. Accordingly, in December 1902, Major A.H. McMahon was appointed as His Majesty’s Commissioner for the delimitation of the portion of the frontier from the neighbourhood of Padaha (Mirjawa) to Koh-i-Malik Giah.6. In the view of Major McMahon, the Holdich line of 1896, which, as has already been mentioned, was based on an incorrect map, was open to several objections, one of which was that it ran too close to the British post at Pobat to be convenient. To obviate the objections, Major McMahon suggested an alternative line which gave as a boundary not only the western and main watershed of the Kacha river and its affluents, but the watershed also of the Piran river, and also left the Robat post 2,552 yards, instead of 423, within British territory, (Major McMahon drew the Holdich line (in blue) and his proposed alternative line (in red) on the Government of India map North-West Trans-Frontier, sheet No.14 N.W., scale 1 inch to 4 miles). He considered that as the whole tract of country through which the blue and red lines were drawn was absolutely barren and uninhabited, it did not annear unreasonable to ask Persia to consent to the slight rectification of boundary involved by the adoption of the red line. 7. Sir A. Hardinge however, thought that it would not be possible to induce the Persian Government to accept Colonel McMahon’s red line. Moreover, Sir A, Hardinge under stood that an exact delimitation of the frontier laid down in the Holdich Agreement would not only not strengthen the British claim to Mirjawa and Duzdab but would give us a line (Col. McMahon’s ’’blue” line) which would be less satisfactory than the supposed existing line, since it would, among other things, bring the frontier to the very doorsdoors of the British fort at Robat Killa and perhaos to a point east of the British post at Padaha. 8, Sir A, Hardinge suggested therefore that in return for a quid pro quo in Seistan affairs His Majesty’s Government should be prepared to withdraw Colonel McMahon’s Mission and drop the delimitation. The boundary would in that case be the stream flowing between Mirjawa and Padaha, the former place remaining on the Persian, the latter on the British side. 9* An agreement was accordingly concluded by Sir A. Hardinge on 13th May, 1905. By the agreement, His Majesty’s Government withdrew the claim to the ownership of Mirjawa; the British outnost at Padaha was to be allowed to procure supplies of water from Mirjawar; the further examination of the frontier line was abandoned; and ’’this frontier shall be definitely ’’settled in accordance with the agreement of 1896, and ”no further claim shall be made in resnect of it”. 10. The solution arrived at therefore in regard to the boundary was for the maintenance of the status quo. In 1912, it appeared that the Government of India interorcted the status quo as meaning the then existing conditions of occunation by either side and considered Col. McMahon’s ’’red” line as roughly renresenting the limits of British occupation. It appeared also that the local British authorities had orders not to permit any tresnass between the ’’red” and ’’blue” lines and the Government of India did not anticipate any difficulty— I 5 « ( 0 ) r in giving effect to those orders. 11. The matter arose at that time in connexion with Persian claims to Kacha and Piran. As it was con sidered that a delimitation of the whole frontier would then he most inopportune and as the Government of India believed they could deal with the matter locally, it was decided that the only course to be followed, though a far from satisfactory one, was to allow the question to remain unsettled in the hope that the Persian Government might not again raise it, and if they did, to avoid replying to them for as long as possible. 12.

The statement that the “ red” line roughly represented the limits of our occupation in 1905 is based on the following considerations :— (a) When, after the demarcation of the Baluch-Afghan boundary line in 1895, the opening up of a trade route to Sistan brought us into contact with this tract of country, we found it absolutely uninhabited, and our local officials not knowing the exact position of the boundary treated the tract lying between the “ red ” and “ blue ” lines as being on the British side of the Persian frontier. The original alignment of our trade route ran through this tract from Kacha, south of the Kacha Koh, via Bug Thana and Piran. The word Thana used in our maps, in conjunction with Bug, refers to the fact of our having placed a levy Thana, i.e., post, at that place. This post, when a better alignment for the trade route was subsequently found to the north of the Kacha Koh, was transferred elsewhere. th) Mr. Tucker, in his letter of the 15th March 1907, was incorrect in raodfO ) describing the Zarezais, to whose intermittent occupation he refers, as “hardly British subjects”. They, like all other Afghans whose lands fell on the British side of the B:\lucl\- Afghan boundary line demarcated in 1891-95, became ipso facto British subjects in regard to such lands. These same Zarezais have always been treated as British subjects in respect of their lands at Piran. 3. As regards our instructions of the 14th October 1911 to the local authorities not to permit any trespass between the “ red ” and “ blue ” lines, we would remark that local orders to this effect have been in force in Balu chistan since 1905.

The Marquess of Crewe is not aware what authority the Government of India have for describing the red line on the map as roughly repre senting the limits of our occupation in 1905. Colonel MacMahon s memorandum of 5th November 1905 (in which the red line is advocated on grounds of convenience and the district between the two lines is said to be “ absolutely barren and uninhabited ”) does not appear to support this description, while Mr. Tucker’s letter of 15th March 1907 (enclosed in this Office letter of 22nd June 1907) states that there were no British levies west of the blue line in the spring of 1905 and that “ the status was one of intermittent Zarezai occupation.” The Zarezais are neither Persian nor British subjects, and since they divide their time between British and Afghan territory, Sir E. Grey may be disposed to regard their intermittent occupation in 1905 as justifying the con tention that the Persian Government lifts no right to the territory east of the red line, which is the true watershed. On the other hand, it may be admitted that we have made no formal claim to the territory, and difficulties may arise in carrying out the instructions given by the Government of India to the local authorities in their letter of 14th October 1911, that “ any trespass between the red and blue lines . . . should not be permitted.” I have, Ac., The Under Secretary of State, B.

Sir E.

To The Most Hon’blk the MARQUIS or CREWE, K.G., P.C., Jlu Majetty'i Secretary of State for India. Calcutta, the 18th January 1912. Mr Lord Marquis, With reference to your telegram, dated the 5th December 1911, regarding the alleged violation on the part of the British Indian authorities of the Perso-Baluch frontier, we have the honour to forward, for the inform ation of His Majesty’s Government, a copy of the papers noted in the accom panying schedule. 2. In August* last, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, Deputy Governor of Seiatan, who for some time previouslv had been • Enclosures Not. i »n4 2 . instigating the Baluchis to‘raid in the Kainat, extended his operations towards British territory by sending his emissary, one Nazar Jan, to Kacha to recover his share of the^ looted property which had been taken across the British border from Kain. On receipt of this information we tele- t Enclosure No. s. grapliedf to the Uon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan to expel Nazar Jan and his party from British territory, and directed that he should not be permitted to take away any persons or property that he might have seized in British limits, ihe Local British authorities had, however, j Enclosure No. 14. already takenj action, and it will be seen from the report, dated the Uth September 1911, from our Agent in Bal ichistan that the Persian party actually arrived at Bug, which is well within the territory we claim, but were made to remove themselves, leaving a represent ative in the person of Nazar Jan, to whom, after careful enquiry, the loot claimed by the Persians was restored, as it was clearly shown that the property had been robbed from Persian territory. 3. In connection with the question of the boundary in this locality, we would invite a reference to Sir H. McMahon’s memorandum on the Perso- Baluch boundary question of the 5th November 190i!, which formed an § Cop, fo r w.rd,d»Hh Foreign irt..r enclosure of his letter No. 2510,§ dated No. 4s m., dated the 1st December i'ju4. the 5 th November 1904, and to the mao annexed thereto. The principles underlying the settlement which was ultimately arrived at by Sir A. Uardinge at Tehran in 1905, were that the boundary should not be specifically defined, that the status quo should be adhered to, and that no further claim should be made by either side. The status quo meant the then existing conditions of occupation by either side. The “ red ” line on the map referred to above ro ughl y represented the limits of our occupation, and it will be seen that Piran lies well within this line, while Kacha is on our side even of the “ blue ” line. It will thus be observed that not only has there been no violation of Persian limits on our part but the Persians have themselvej disturbod the status quo by transgressing British territory.A V 2 4.

It is reported that Hashmat-ul-Mulk is proposing to start towards Sarhad in a few days with a force of some 2,000 men, the alleged object being to recover from Baluchi Sarhad the loot taken by them from Kain. The Russian Consul and I are making joint enquiry from him as to scope of his expedition, and unless I hear to the contrary I am warning him that we cannot view with indifference military operations so close to our frontier, as these may be likely to cause disturbances to spread to tribes on British side of border.

My telegrams Nos. 61 and 62, dated Sth and 14th August. I now hear that emissary from Hashmat-ul-Mulk has arrived at Kacha, where he is engaged ostensibly in recovering property looted from Kain. Another emissary of the Hashmat is looting innocent Baluchis on same pretence in neighbourhood of Koh-i-Malik Siah. 1 believe that these measures have been taken by the Hashmat without Persian Government’s permission, and that they are simply an extension in a new direction of his previous robberies. It is eminently undesirable that he should be permitted to extend his opera tions into British territory, and I would suggest the immediate arrest of emissary at Kacha named Nazar Jan and all his followers on suspicion of brigandage. It is known that Nazar Jan has taken prominent share in Kain robberies. He could be detained until enquiries have been made regarding the authority and objects of his mission. In any case, I strongly deprecate that any prisoners, camels or other property be permitted to leave British territory under this man’s charge. In event of any looted property being recovered, I could inform the Governor of Kain who would send his own men to identify it and take it over.

It will be seen that on hearing of the arrival of the Persian party Major Webb-Ware’s representative, under his instructions, requested them to remove themselves at once, which they did, leaving a representative in the person of one Nazar Jan. Enquiries having shown that the property claimed by the Persians had clearly been robbed from Persian territories, the whole of it was restored to Nazar Jan. 3. There remain in our custody at 'present 19 men who are accused of having brought the stolen property to Bug, and also 10 camels which are con nected with an entirely separate case and which are believed to have been looted from Kain. 4 . I am directing Major Webb-Ware to put the 19 prisoners back across the Persian border, and am asking him to enquire from the British Consul in Seistan whether the latter can arrange to take over the 10 camels still in our possession. Letter No. 155 (Confidential), dated Quetta, the 24th August 1911. From—The Political Agent, Chagai, To—The First Assistant to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. I have the honour to invite a reference to the telegraphic correspondence on the subject of the appearance on the Kacha'Robat frontier of a body of Persians, and to say that I have just received the details from the Officiating Native Assistant, Kacha. 2 . The facts of this incident are briefly as follows:— On the 8 th instant a body of Seistan Jambaz sowars arrived at Bug, which is situated at the head of the Piran river. The Native Assistant on hearing of their arrival communicated with me and received instructions to proceed with sufficient levies to Bug, ascertain what the deputation of this party was due to, prevent any violation of British territory, and, in pointing out that the presence of Persian sowars at Bug conflicted with the terms of the 1905 Tehran agreement, request courteously but firmly their withdrawal.5 • i Hip letter The Native Assistant These orders were earned out to th obtained reached Bug onthc mormug of thc Jth lie askiu a statement from their lea cr '. t |'j j (o w j|lidraw his purpose on the frontier was,and T; t0 ;',“re was no men which he did a few hours a &lt; ‘ Persian sowars so violation of our territory, nor indeed did any icrsian so murh as enter our limits. 3.

There is no Justification for assertion as regards Koh-i-. Malih Siah, :rhich is the only one of the places mentioned which is within my consular Jurisdiction. As regards other places in Sarhad.

Kargusar recently addressed me officially regarding alleged encroachments at Piran and Kaoha Xoh. I replied in accordar. with instructions received last year from Government of India, that both these places were outside my consular jurisdiction and that I could therefore take no cognisance of the matter. The reports may have been due merely to offioiousness of !!ons: Momard of the Customs Department, who recently visited Koh-i-?ialik Siah, or to the mischief- raaking proclivities of the Kargusar. Sudsf) V ^Confidential^ No. 1049-Con6dential, dated Quetta, the 30th October 1907. From—The Hoh'blk Major Sir Henry McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. * j 'With reference to my letter No. 855-Confidential,* dated the 28th August ! I&lt;4 1907, I have the honour to report that a Persian Sultan (Captain) named Muhammad Azim from Koh-i-Malik Siah, accompanied by a Naib and three men, visited Kacha on the 23rd and Piran Ziarat on the 24th August. 2. The Officer Commanding the Robat Detachment, who had had previous notice of the intended visit, sent orders to his Native officers at these places not to permit the Sultan and his party to cross the frontier hut to meet him there and hold any conversation he wished but to be careful not to be drawn into a quarrel with him if possible. This order reached Kacha after the Sultan’s visit but was acted on in the case of Piran Ziarat where the Sultan and his party were stopped on the frontier. 3. The meetings between the Sultan and the Native officers at both places were amicable. The Sultan informed the officers that he had received orders i from the Hakim of Seistan to visit these places and ascertain if it was a fact that British troops had been stationed there and that forts were being erected, and said that he would report that the former was true, but that there was no truth in the report regarding the erection of forts. 4. The Sultan appeared to have a very hazy idea regarding the boundary and said be had been given to understand that the trade route formed the boundary between Baluchistan and Persia and that consequently both Kacha and Piran Ziarat were well within Persian limits. ‘‘The exact boundary,” the Officer Commanding Robat reports, was, however, “ pointed out to him by he * Native officers ” and he was told that no aggression would be permitted under any circumstances. 5. What particular boundary was thus pointed out I have not yet learnt. It was obviously impossible for the Native officer to have given correct information on this point as no boundary line has been laid down. This, however, is immaterial as the information given by that officer, what ever it may have been, carries no weight, and it is extrem ly doubtful whether the Persian Sultan either understood it, or if he did, whether he correctly reported it. 6 . Pam issuing renewed instructions to the Political Agent, Chagai, that no discussion of this kiud on the part of our subordinates with Persian officials is ever to be permitted. Any Persian officials who visit our posts in a friendly manner fire to be treated politely, but referred for any information they require to higher authorities. Any who approach our posts in an unfriendly manner or decline to withdraw w hen requested to do so will be dealt with as the occasion demands. 7 . As a sequel to the Sultan’s visit to Kacha and Piran, the Political Agent, Chagai, has received a further communication, dated September 1 st, from the Karguzar of Seistan through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul. A translation, together with the original document, is forwarded herewith for information. Major Webb Ware in accordance with instructions given in the case of the previous letter, referred to in my letter No. 855+ of 28th August 19 &gt;7, has written to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul in Seistan ackowledging its receipt' and informing him that it has been transmitted to me. 8 . I do not propose to take any further action, or to be drawn into futile discussions with the local Persian authorities. They will doubtless get tired of ineffective attempts to reopen the question, and if the Persian Government ever make representations on the subject, these can easily be disposed of. In the meantime ray instructions to the Political Agent, Chagai, ensure the preservation of the status quo on which Sir A. Hardinge’s settlement of this boundary question was based.- 'i) 2 Translation of a Murasala No. 9, dated 22nd Rajjab 1325 (1st September 1907), from the Karguzar of Seistan to His Britannic Majesty's Consul in Seistan.

Agent, Chagai. You Well knOW that a. h. mcMahow. both these places lie within Persian - territory and beyond your jurisdiction, and to remove this tresspass I beg that these people may be ordered to vacate these places. I have received to-day a regrettable report from Muhammad Azim Beg, Sultan of Koh-i-Malik Siah, to the effect that 75 sepoys and a Jemadar with their arms and ammunition have established themselves at Kacha and 50 sepoys with a Native officer have gone to Piran. The Sultan conversed with these people and learnt certain matters which are contrary to those which have come to light. It is a matter of deep regret that despite so great a friendship as exists between the two Governments, British employes, trespassing beyond their boundary, have entered Persian territory. I therefore most respectfully beg that you will please take early steps to withdraw these men so as to avoid any chance of inimical feelings arising between the two Governments.

From—The Hon’ble Major Sir Henry McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Gevernment of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my letter No. 1049-Confidential, dated the 30th October 1907, and with reference to paragraphs 4 and 5 thereof, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, an extract from a letter, dated the 14th November 1907, from the Officer Commanding the Robat escort to the Political Agent, Chagai, from which it will be observed that no particular boundary was pointed out by the Native officer at Piran to Sultan Muhammad Azim on the occasion of the latter’s visit to Kacha ami Piran. Extract from a letter, dated the 14th November 1907, from the Officer Commandin^the Robat Escort, to the Political Agent, Chagai. In reply to yours of the 8 th instant, the Jemadar in Command of the Piran detachment on the occasion of Sultan Muhammad Azim’s visit made no definite statement regarding the line of the trontier. He told Muhammad Azim that he had no map and could not define the frontier, hut that he knew for certain that the position on which he was encamped and all country north of the most northern Ziarat was in British territory, but he made no statement that country south of the Ziarat was in Persian territory or where the boundary commenced. The Sultan himself professed equal ignorance but said he had always understood that the ttobat-Nushki trade route formed the boundary. The Sultan was treated in every way in a friendly spirit and entertained both at Kacha and Piran which pleased him greatly, so Ashraf Khan informs me. He offered to make the Jamadar at Piran Katkhuda if he was willing to give him Rs. 50 for the appointment. This was naturally declined. O. I. C. p. O.— No. 3754 F. D.-a-l-1908-85-W. G.

But as regards Piran, it is beyond my Pp*® 1 to make any alterations in the present state of things, as the particulars of the occupation of the place have been reported to the high officials of the Persian Government. It is an admitted fact that, in deference to that P^nty of intentions and the friendly relations existing between the British and the Persian Governments, the high officials of the British Government have no intention to encroach upon the territory of the Persian Government; nor have the high Persian officials any such intention. You may now complete your enquiries and I think that, after discussion of the matter and its proof, you will be pleased to take necessary steps in this matter also without deviating from the path of justice, as you have done before.— Usual ending.

Secondly, as it is a boundary affair, I hope you will excuse me if I put to you the question, whether those places are in territory over which you h^e con trol, because they are not within the Seistan boundary. You will kindly oblige me by an early reply. IX Translation of a copy of a letter from Mumtabin-us-Sultanah to His Britannic Majesty's Consul in SeisUn, dated the 6th Zikad (22nd December 1906). After compliments .—In reply to your letter about the Piran and Kacha lands, I have the honour most respectfully to state that from the ttorough euquiries that have been made, the said p.eces of land are admittedly the nrouertv of the Persian Government. About two years ago when the place had P been taken forcible possession of by Rashid Khan and Isa Khan, and bad been retaken from their possession by Murtaza Kuli Khan, the Assistant Boundary Officer of the Persian Government, no objection whatever wns then raised by the representatives of the British Government. It is an admitted fertthat in deference to the friendly relation existing between the British and Persian Governments, none of the two Governments has shown any inclination or will ever consent to encroach upon one another s land. T ils nut“ ” far as U known, at present being discussed between the British Minister at Tehran and the Foreign Minister of the Persian Government and you will presently receive a communication about it from the British Minister .—Complimentary ending.4 X ^ Tr&amp;naktion o! % copy of »letter from Hie Excellency the Momtehin-us-Sultanah to Hie Britennic Majesty^ Consul in Seistan, dated the 21st Zikad (6th January 1907). After covnpluMntB.—I have the honour to state that yesterday I received a telegram from my Government that it bad been represented to them by the British Minister that sowars and soldiers of the Persian Government had been despatched to the vicinity of Kacha and Piran, and that they had taken, and were taking, certain measures. As I have taken no steps whatsoever in despatching sowars and soldiers to that vicinity, I beg most respectfully to request you to let me know at once as to who has despatched these to wars and soldiers to that vicinity and what are the particulars of the measures taken; whether those soldiers have been despatched by the Assistant Boundary Officer of Malik Siah Koh or by the Kerman frontier officials, in order that I may take immediate steps. I am awaiting a very early reply.— Usual ending. XL Translation of a copy of a letter from His Britannic Majesty's Consul in Seistan to teh Mumtahin-us-Sultanah, dated the 6th January 1907. After compliments.—In reply to your letter enquiring of the measures taken as regards Piran and Kacha, I have the honour most respectfully to invite your attention to the letter from Mr. Daukes, the former Consul, which had been sent to Your Excellency on the 20th November, corresponding to the 3rd Shawal. The said letter contains the particulars of the measures taken. Vorsign Ottos PWsi-N®. 23V- 74-07-74.No. 156-Confl., dated ftibi, the 14th February 1907 (Confidential). From—The Hon’ble Mk. A. L. P. Tucker, C.I.E., Officiating Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my telegram No. ^145-0., dated the 13th February 1907, regarding the boundary disputes at Piran and Kacha, I have the honour to subjoin in extenso a copy of Major Webb Ware’s telegram No. L.C.-20, dated the 11th February 1907, and a copy of the telegraphic instructions issued by me to him in reply. 2. As regards the Piran question, the telegrams cited above show the present position. A later report will follow when Major Webb Ware’s report is received. 3. As regards Kacha, it will be observed that the location of our levies there has not been seriously challenged, and that one of the Rekis of Kirtaka, which is well within our boundary, has cultivated there at intervals since 1897. The Persian bazgirs from the Duzdap side appear to have levied transit dues occasionally on caravans in this neighbourhood during the past three years, while we have collected for the last ten a tax on asafoetida taken from the hills. As to these minor points I await Major Webb Ware’s rdjport before addressing the Government of India. 4. In connection with Piran the Government of India will observe that the visit of the Persian Sultan (or, apparently Officer in Command of Sarbazes) from Diwanchah, which was followed by the ejection of our levies, occurred on the 14th November, after Lieutenant Daukes’ letter of the 5th November, to the Mumtahin*us-Sultana in which Piran and Kacha were referred to as Persian territory and the cultivators were said to be Afghans. I am not sure as to the extent to which our Consular Officers in the border territory of Persia are expected to intervene in regard to border questions. I think, however, that except in very exceptional and urgent cases, Consular action or intervention should not be allowed without a previous reference to the border administra tion concerned, if not to the Government of India. The first intimation received in this Agency that the presence of our levies at either Piran or Kacha Koh was in question was received under a telegram from the Consul, dated the 22nd November, in which it was stated that the Karguzar complained that the Robat levies had taken possession of Persian lands at Piran and Kacha, and that it was understood that he had turned out the Piran levies. The telegram further enquired what were the facts of the case. The Political Agent in reply, after reference to myself, requested the Consul to explain that the places where our levies were posted were within our boundary and that the Karguzar’s action was not understood, and that it was hoped that it would not be repeated. The enclosed copy of letter No. Ill, dated the 8th August 1905, from the Political Assistant in Chagai (Major Benn), shows the circumstances in which our men were sent to Piran, after the withdrawal of the Seistan Mission in the autumn of 1905.

Your report is awaited early. No. Ill-Confidential, dated the 8th August 1905. From— The Political Assistant, Chagai, To-The First Assistant to the Hon’ble the A^ent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. I have the honour to inform you that during the recent ™it of Colonel McMahon to Quetta on his return from Seistan an interview on the subject of the Perso-Baluoh Frontier was held between the Hon ble the Agent to the Governor-General and Colonel McMahon at which I was present. The Hon’hle the Agent to the Governor-General will no doubt remember that at this interview Colonel McMahon urged very strongly the necessity of our nutting a few men without delay into two places along the Baluch-Persian border toth^ south-east of Koh-i-Malik Siah, viz., at the Piran Ziarat and the -Rnth these places are on important routes leading from Mirjawa and Person BalSsten through our territory to Afghanistan. Of the two the Piran Ziarat route is perhaps the more important. , , . . ,. 2 I have now the honour to report that, acting on the verbal instructions which I received from the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General at the above interview, I endeavoured to make arrangements to furnish the above two nosta wi h'ome men. But it was found that to do so would have meant a reduction of our levy strength at the different thauas at the western end of the mute to an extent which we could not afford to risk, especially as the Mission had TiW moment been withdrawn from Seistan. As a temporary measure and nondinc the establishment of the new'first class levies along the route, I have been able to make the following arrangement for the establishment of a smapost at Piran Ziarat without inourrinpr any extra expenditure to Government. TheChagai Levy establishment includes a post of “ Jemadar of camels at Dalbandin on Rs. 20 per mensem. This appointment was apparently created in the early days of the route when it was often necessary for travellers to obtain fresh camels at Dalbandin. With the introduction of the new camel contract whereby the contractors are bound to supply camels straight through to Seistan, the necessity for a Government camel agent at Dalbandin appears to me to have disappeared. I have, therefore, subject to the Hon'blo the Agent to the Governor- General’s approval done away with the appointment and utilized the pay of the Jemadar (Rs. 20) for two extra Levy footmen (on Rs. 10 per mensem) who have already taken up their quarters at Piran Ziarat. 3. For the second post at Kacha river I propose finding a temporary estab lishment in the following way:— It is proposed that six men with a thorough knowledge of the country should be enlisted locally at Robat as guides for service in the new first class levies. It will be sometime before the detachment of the new levies, who are now being enlisted in Mastung, can be equipped and made ready for Robat. The men whom it is proposed to enlist locally as guides could, however, be enlisted at once at Robat, and I would suggest sending two or more of them without delay to reside at the Kacha river post until some better arrangement can be made. I should be *lad to know if the above proposals meet with the approval of the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General. Extract from the Seistan Consular diary No. 3 for the period 14th to 19th January 1907. Reffardin* the Piran incident, the Mumtahin said his action was forced on o ° 1 . 1 _ ■ » r XT'! r T’V. ^ loff-A.. Ka a map, and had pointed out that encroachments were being made on Persian territory at Piran. and Kacba. The ^fumtahin went on to say that ho had referred the matter to Lieutenant Daukes, who, in his reply, had admitted that Piran and Kacha were Persian territory, and had informed him that the people settled there were Afghans. The Mumtahin had accordingly taken necessary steps to re-establish Persian rights. On my asking him whether, now that he had been made acquainted with the true facts, he was prepared to restore the status quo, he replied, firstly, that the matter was being settled at Tehran, and, secondly, that he had telegraphed his resignation and could therefore take no further action. As regards the alleged admission of Persian rights to Piran and Kacha, it is only necessary to say, that without specially admitting the Persian claims in the preamble of Ms letter of the 5th November, Lieutenant Daukes referred to “ Piran and Kacha in Persian territory.” As half of Piran at any rate seems to belong to Persia, the sentence admits of interpretation in two ways. The admission, such as it was, has been subsequently corrected and cannot of course be accepted as a reasonable excuse for the MumtaMn’s refusal to restore the status quo. Wednesday, 16th January.—Vae Mumtahin, who arrived here with an His story about M. Nekrassof having put him up to the Piran business seemed so improbable, especially in view of the mutual orders lately sent to British and Russian Consular Officers in Persia, that I thought, if the matter was brought to the notice of the Russian Consul, it might prove the means of removing”some misunderstanding, I therefore spoke to M. Nekrassof on th e I The Finn incident. him by M. Nikrassof. The latter, he stated, had brought and exhibited to him Anglophil reputation, seems lately to have been doing his best to cause a different impression.A subject this morning, and I was not surprised when he absolutely &lt;kmed having aiven the Mumtahin any advice at all on the subject. In the matter of the man, he said that so far from showing the Mumtahin a map, the ktlcr had bwu-ht one to him and asked him to explain the Piran frontier, a subject on which M. Nekrassof told mo he had disclaimed any knowledge. I believe that the first part of this statement is substantially correct, though it is of course impossible to say whether the Russian Consul really maintained the attitude of aloofness he claims to have done. It may be mentioned that I have heard from other sources that the Mnmtahin has been taking a map about to different people with a view to ^citing information about-Piran and the McMahon line, tUie^np. Uon given me, it seems to be a Government of India map. I am making further enquiries. / t i •. I. C.JP. O.—No. 4697 F. D. -18-S-1907.-M-W. 0.

Adverting to correspondence ending with my letter No. 156, dated the 14th ultimo, regarding the disputed boundary at Piran and Kacha, I have the honour to submit, for the orders of the Government of India, the pnclosed copy of report No. •2 Memoranda. 140-L.-C., dated the 19th February 1907, 2 Ma P«- with accompaniments,* received from Major F. C. Webb Ware, C.I.E., the Political Agent in Chagai. 2. It will be perceived from these reports that in May 1905, when the recent agreement between our own and the Persian Governments was concluded, the stains as regards occupation at Piran was as follows. There had been cultivation on the various small plots that are culturable on the river bank by the Zarezais, who can hardly be described as British subjects although they spend part of their time in British limits, part in the Garmsel of Afghanistan and part in Seistan. This culti vation considerably antedated the Holdich delimitation, but apparently ceased in 1894 and was resumed in the summer of 1906, in which season the two levies, who were posted at Piran by my orders in 1905 cultivated a small plot with melons. The Zarezais had also erected a small Ziarat 15 years ago among the other Ziarats at Piran. There is no evidence of any other sort of occupation in Piran. There is nothing to show that, before 1905, there was any transaction there which could be construed into occupancy or control by or with the permission of the Persian Government. 3. As regards Kacha we have had cultivation by our people at Kacha Thana from 1897 to 1900. We maintained a levy post there up to 1899 when it was removed and have levied taxes on the collections of asafoetida within Colonel McMahon’s blue line for ten years. There is no question about our right to post our levies and to permit cultivation here. There have been one or two unjusti fiable collections by Persian “ bazgirs ” of grazing dues from British subjects within our boundary since 1903, but any Persian claim here appears to me to be i quite untenable. The Kacha portion of the case presents no difficulty. 4. The Piran part of the case, however, is not so easy. Colonel McMahon’s blue line from peak 7714 northwards to Koh-i-Malik Siah does not represent a delimited boundary. It represents an illustration of an incorrect definition and its adoption as our boundary is admittedly inconvenient. What then are the limits of occupation on this section ? If we are to apply the criterion of the stains quo ante May 1905, then I was perhaps wrong in posting the two levies there in the autumn of 1905. There were no levies on our part there before that date: the status was one of intermittent Zarezai occupation. By the agreement of May 1905, however, the frontier is to be regarded as definitely settled in accordance with the agreement of 1896 and no further claim is to be made in respect of it. The agree ment of 1896 does not mention Piran Ziarat, but, in paragraph 15 of his report No. 77 -T. H. of the 23rd June 1896, Colonel Holdich states that the Piran Ziarat on the banks of the stream of that name is exactly on the line. Hence there was no irregularity in the despatch of the two levies to Piran : such action does not consti tute the making of a further claim. The hypothetical boundary is up to the Ziarat. The Persian action in removing the Zarezais and in claiming a boundary up to; the trade route has been quite unjustifiable. But, as I have already reported,! we are not in a position to claim Piran in entirety. If we can send our levies to \ the Ziarat the Persians do not appear to be barred from cultivating up to it. Hence I doubt if there are adequate reasons for removing the Shahizai cultivators— the interlopers of Major Webb Ware’s report—whom the Persian official from Diwan Chah placed there last winter. The return of the Zarezais and the restora tion of our levies there appear to be as much action as is now called for and this has been taken. In Kacna we are retaining our levies and cultivation. Majo} Webb Ware is in error in mentioning the Padagi spring on .the Kacha side as being in Persian limits : it is not so, in the absence of evidence of Persian occu pation. 5205 F. D. •5. In view of the passage regarding the Piran Ziarat in Colonel Holdich’s report, to which I have referred the line between the highest peak in the Koh-i-Malik Siah and the Kacha Kob, can hardly be regarded as leaving the Piran Ziarats on the British side. 6. It may be remembered in connection with the case generally that the acqui- t* sition of the red line boundary would be valuable to us only in the event of the establishment by Russia of paramount influence in Seistan and Persian Baluchistan. (Sir A. Hardinge’s Confidential despatch No. 1 of the 6th January 1905.) No. 140-L. C. (Confidential), dated Camp Killa Robat, the 19th February 1907. From—The Political Agent, Chagai, To—The First Assistant to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. In compliance with the orders conveyed me in Foreign Department telegram No. S.-16, dated 7th January, I have the honour to submit two memoranda, each illustrated with a map, dealing with the Piran-Kacha Koh boundary, for favour of consideration and orders. 2. It will be noted that the boundary in the neighbourhood of Piran, which the Perso-Baluch delimitation agreement lays down, is a line carried straight from “ the highest point of the Kacha Koh to the highest point of the Malik Siah Koh,” docs not cross the river, as the British Commissioner understood was the case, at the point known as “ Piran Ziarat ” (vide paragraph 15 of his report) : but at a point some 2,445 yards further up-stream, i.e., to the south. The bend which the river makes at this point, which the map I attach illustrates, is no doubt responsible for this error. The boundary as shown in this map is the correct one : but, if it be decided that the frontier bisects “ Piran Ziarat ”, I foresee that a difficulty will arise, for the Persians will doubtlessly claim the most northern Ziarat as being the “ Ziarat ” intended, whereas it is equally certain that we are justified in claiming the most southern. If we take Piran Ziarat to mean the land of that name, then another difficulty presents itself, for any division of this land will leave the water supply on the Persian side and, unless provision is made to regulate them, quarrels are likely to ensue between the Zarizai owners and the Shahazai interlopers. 3. In the course of his interview with His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, as referred to in Sir C. Spring Rice’s telegram No. 18, dated the 15th January, the Grand Vizier is understood to have stated that no military officials were deputed to Piran. I would venture to traverse this for Muhammad Hussain, who is stationed at Diwan Chah and enjoys the rank of Sultan, visited Piran on the 14th November and depriving the Zarizai of the lands they possess not only at Piran Ziarat but also those situated to the north, our claim to which cannot be contested, escorted them to a point 7 miles down the river, near to where it dis charges itself, and returned by way of the trade route and Robat. I think we are justified in taking exception to this action as it is clearly an infringement of the May 1905 agreement. 4. It will be noted that, on the occasion of his visit to Piran, Sultan Muhammad Hussain alleged that Persian territory extended north as far as the trade route. His action on the occasion tends to demonstrate that such was his belief. It will also be noted that the Bazgirs who visited Saindak in October alleged the same. I think that we are entitled to ask that Persian officials stationed on the frontier may be instructed regarding this subject for claims of this nature, although no doubt they are advanced by ignorant officials, do not make for the preservation of the 1905 agreement which it is our desire to see upheld. 5. As regards Kacha I have nothing to remark except to invite a reference to Sir H. McMahon’s secret report dealing with the frontier in this neighbourhood, and to add that the point where the levies were posted is that shown as “ Kacha Thana ” on the map and that the drainage basin of the Kacha river, as delineated on sheet No. 14-N. W., is correct. 6. I would express regret that this report has been so greatly delayed. The cause of this is the inclemency of the weather I have encountered since my arrival on this frontier.3 PlRAN. Situation. The cultivation lies on the banks of the Piran river near where it is ^ cut by the Perso-Baluch Boundary and consists of five pieces of land collectively amounting to some 8 or 10 acres cultivated by one Rashid Khan, brother to Rustam Khan Kutkhuda of Dekdela in Garmsel, and by certain Shahozai Persian Baluch interlopers. Piran extends from north to south, along the river banks, 2,860 yards. While the whole of this is known, collectively, as Piran, vet each piece of land has its own special name. To deal specifically with each The most northern is called “ Nokjo It lies on the left bank, at the furthest ex remity of I iran, and, although prepared last year for sowing, was never actually cultivated as the Zanzai were ejected by the Persians before they were able to Psext up stream comes “ Daualatabad This is situated about 660 yards from Nokjo and is also on the left bank of the river. It was prepared, like Nokjo, for cultivation but was not actually sown. Three hundred and eighty-five yards south of Daualatabad ” hes “Abdullabad ” situated on both sides of the river i.a &lt; P/ aced . las ^ summer under cultivation, but, as in the case of the lands referred to above, its Zanzai cultivators were ejected by the Persians. In addition to the foregoing there were two small pieces of land, on the right bank named respectively, ‘‘Zohrabad” and “ Ahmedabad,” these ^opposite Daualatabad and Nokjo, respectively, and no attempt has been made to culti- ^ yearS ; They are both Significant in area. South of Abdullabadatadistanceof220yards, is placed the most important land on the river which is known as “ Piran Ziarat ”, a name derived from the several Ziarate i«r he T mity ' JV 8 an elon gated stretch of ground some 355 yards in length by 165 yfirdsm breath at the widest. About 330 yards above Piran Ziarat comes he last piece termed Murghi ” which is watered from the same channel which supplies Piran Ziarat. In $rea it is insignificant. The lands north of Piran Ziarat each possess their own irrigation channel taking off from the main supply m thfr river bed. The water for the Piran Ziarat cultivation takes its rise in a patch of jungle m the river bed some 770 yards up-stream. follows'-*“ TheSe number foUr and enumerated from north to south are as (i) S}ed Langar, 330 yards north of the Piran Ziarat cultivation. (ii) Shahid Langar situated 190 yards to the south of No. (i) and said to be the Ziarat of No. one’s disciple. (iii) Syed Hussain Langar, 170 yards south of No. (ii) and said to be the Ziarat of No. one’s son. (iv) Pir Sultan Ziarat, 180 yards south of No. (iii). In addition to the foregoing there is a small ziarat a few yards west of No. fii) which was erected, so Kutkhuda Rustam, who came in from Garmsel to see me and has proved of great assistance, teUs me by his idiot son Wali some 15 years ago but it is generally regarded as being spurious. As to which of the foregoing is the most important is a question which it is not easy to decide. Nos. (ii) and (iii) may be eliminated, the sanctity attached to them being of small import; the difficulty lies in deciding between the relative merits of Nos. (i) and (iv). * The ziarats of Pir Sultan and Syed Langar are usually to be found in close juxtaposition throughout the western portion of this Agency. Of the two saints the Pir Sultan has the larger following and is regarded as being the most powerful for good or evil • while this is so, however, the question in reality resolves itself into one of belief! The followers of the Syed regard him as being the premier whereas the adherents of Pir Sultan, who allege that their saint was a companion of the Prophet, traverse this. Counting the graves which each ziarat claims as its own did not show a way out of the difficulty, for, whereas the Syed Ziarat has 25 graves to its credit as against Pir Sultan Ziarat’s 16, it was explained that certain Zarizai wayfarers, whose saint is the Syed, lost 8 children, while passing a few years ago through Piran, from fever of a malignant type, thus giving the Syed’s Ziarat the present balance of graves in its favour. r&lt;x. 4 ' Routes leading from Piran. North. —(1) Shilag (Shah-i-Gadar). (2) Put. (3) Badal-Kamal Khan or Deckdela according to the destination of the caravan. South. —(1) Duzdap, whence numerous routes branch off. It may be noted that all intercommunication between the northern portion of Sarhad and Garmsel is conducted via the Piran river route which is good and easy • throughout. Trade .—From 80 to 90 camels pass, on an average, monthly along the Piran route during the eight warm months of the year and about half that number during the winter months to which, in the case of the latter, may be added from 20 to 30 pack bullocks and donkeys which only ply during this season. The trade consists of ghi, wool and dates from Sarhad which exchange in Garmsel for wheat. Ownership of land .—The land at Piran belongs to the Zanzai, a sub-section of the Jhalawan Mengals, who move about between this country, Seistan and Garmsel. ( It was granted to Rustam Khan, now Kutkhuda of Deckdela, by Sardar Kamal Khan about 25—30 years ago when the latter fled Seistan after unsuccessfully engaging in hostilities with Sardar Sharif Khan Narui. Prior to this Piran had never been cultivated. Kutkhuda Rustam, on hearing last November that his brother Rashid Khan had been dispossessed of Piran, sent the Sanad, under which he held possession, to him with instructions to take it, in person, to Diw an Chah and show it to the Persian Sultan. His brother did so and the Sultan, who had previously received 200 krans and five sheep as a bribe from Lai Muhammad, the Shahozai Taoki Baluch whom he had installed at Piran, said that he would render back the land provided the Zarizai gave him two Baluch carpets and 150 krans, and until these demands were complied with he refused to return the sanad. Last summer, under private arrangement with Rashid Khan, the two levies stationed at Piran placed a small patch of land opposite No. 3 ziarat under melons. This is the only land which has, so far, been cultivated directly or indirectly by us. Prior to last year the Piran lands had not been cultivated since 1894. Recent events .—In July 1905 two sowars were stationed at Piran and two at Kacha to guard these roads and to keep an eye on the traffic which passes through with special regard to the illicit trade in arms, a very necessary precaution as the records show. On the 14th November a Persian Sultan named Muhammad Hussain, accompanied, among others, by Lai Muhammad and Dur Muhammad Shahozai, arrived at Piran. He enquired of Rashid Khan what he was doing there and directed him to withdraw. Rashid Khan said that he was cultivating lands which the Zarizai had held from upwards of a generation. The Sultan rejoined that as they were not Persian subjects the Zarizai must quit Piran forthwith and placing their more important possessions on three camels, he had with him, he escorted them, in person, to a point 7 miles north of Piran Ziarat situated close to the mouth of the Piran river and leaving them there made his way back to Diwan Chah via the trade route and Robat. The Sultan informed the Zarizai, as he also did the levies, that they were trespassing on Persian territory whose limits extended, he alleged, as far as the trade route. Some few days later the same Sultan sent instructions by Lai Muhammad to eject our levies which was accordingly done. The levies have since been replaced and are still at Piran Ziarat. They reside on the left bank of the river a few yards north of Ziarat No. 1, where they have instructions to remain. Boundary .—A reference to the accompanying map drawn by a member of my office, late of the Government of India Survey Department, is requested. If a straight line carried from Koh-i-Malik Siah to the highest peak of the Kacha Koh range is held, as it certainly is, to be the boundary, then all the lands at Piran, enumerated in this memorandum, fall on our side of the frontier, for, as will be seen, the boundary passes 705 yards west of the left bank of the river opposite Piran Ziarat. If, however, the frontier is taken to bisect Piran Ziarat, vide the explanation accompanying Colonel T. Holdich, Commissioner, Persq-Baluch Delimitation’s report, the question which presents itself for settlement is which ziarat is to be regarded as that referred to by him. As this is a problem whose solution appears5 likely to offer considerable difficulty, the most equitable settlement would appear to be in dividing the Piran Ziarat lands equally between Persia and ourselves. Remarks .—The status quo in May 1905 and the status quo ante are sufficiently explained in the body of this memorandum. The Zarizais returned to Piran on their ( ^vn initiative. They have been warned, and the levies instructed, not to interfere vuth Persians, t.e., Shahozai Baluch cultivators. There are no sarbazes at Piran. and none were left there by Sultan Muhammad Hussain. F. C. WEBB WA RE, A/a/or, Political Agtnt, Chaq*t. Kacha. The existing mop.—With reference to Sir H. McMahon’s signed map sheet No. 14-N.-W., dated Seistan, 5th November 1904, it may be well to premise this memo randum by saying that the several peaks south of Kacha through which his blue boundary line passes, enumerated from east to west, are :— The mountain which connects peak 7157[with peak 7336 and thence continues to Kacha is named the Mazawad range ; these two peaks being termed, respectively, ‘ k Kisan Mazawad” and “ Mazan Mazawad ” or Mazawad the lower and Mazawad the higher. The peak due south of Kacha “ thana ” which is cut by the blue boundary line is named Bagh-Koh and peak 7033, which lies nearly due west from here, is term ed Padagi Koh, the name under which the western prolongation of this mountain is also known. The range which the blue boundary line follows from peak 7157 to Bagh-Koh is the Suntabad range and the large nullah lying immediately below its northern foot is named the Suntabad nullah. It may incidentally be remarked that the word “ Sant ” in the Baluchi language means “ devoid of.” There is no water in the nullah. Within the Kacha drainage limits, as marked by the blue boundary line, there are, excluding the nullah just named, three important nullahs. That shown on the map running parallel to the southern foot of the Kacha Koh enjoys the name of the Pourchinki nullah. There is a spring of water in a small feeder at the head of this nullah but the supply although good and constant is scanty. The large nullah which runs near the northern foot of Padagi is known as Padagi Nullah. South-east of Padagi Koh there is a spring of water known as the Padagi spring which yields an abundant supply but it lies on the Persian side of the frontier. The main drainage nullah flowing north-east from Bagh hill is known up to the point it approaches Kacha “ Thana ” as the Bagh nullah and the large nullah, which runs north-west parallel to the Mazawad range and forms one of the main feeders of the Bagh nullah, is called the Mazawad nullah. At the northern foot of the Bagh Koh a small spring of water exists, but the supply is scanty, although apparently somewhat in excess of that yielded by the Pourchinki spring. The only other springs of water which are to be found within Kacha blue boundary limits are those of Chedegi and Mazawad. The former appears much on par, as regards supply, with the Bagh spring: native information affirms, however, that the latter, which is situated at the head of the Mazawad nullah, and is, apparently, from 400— 600 feet higher than Kacha “ Thana ” has a very fair supply of water, although the spring, itself, is somewhat shut in. There are no other remarks to make regarding the existing map except to say that the drainage basin of the Kacha river as shown in it is correct. Cultivation. —The only cultivation which has ever existed within the limit under reference is at Kacha “ Thana ”, vide the attached map. The land here is the pro perty of the Rekis who nominally own the hill range which separates Saindak from the Piran river. From 1899-1900, inclusive, these lands were cultivated by one Jangian, a near relative of the Reki Levy Duffadar who holds charge of the Kirtaka post- From the year 1900 they have been neglected and this state of affairs continu ed up to the summer of 1906 when, at the initiative of the Kirtaka Levy Duffadar, a small piece of ground, a few square yards in area, was placed under melons. In 1899 the levy post at Kacha was transferred to Chah Muhammad Raza, on the more direct route, and, no doubt, it was the withdrawal of the protection afforded by this post that was largely responsible for the land falling out of cultivation. It may bo remarked that this same Jangian, prior to 1897, had taken crops off the Kacha lands from time to time. In area the cultivable land at Kacha “thana”, 5205 F.D. ., ..6 collectively, amounts to about 25 acres which includes some ground a few acres in extent opposite the thana on the right bank of the river a couple o hundred yards up-stream which has, so far, never apparently been brought into cultivation. The soil is good and water is plentiful from numerous springs, the discharges from three of which, although they are partially blockedf, up with debris, are very large. The actual area of the land placed under melons last year would be rather less than 2 acres. In climate Kacha is cooler than Paindak which in turn gives place to Robat. It is said to be healthy but on the lower lands the mosquitos are a source of some annoyance. Post/ion.—The position shown on sheet No. 14-N.-W. of Kacha thana, as I will term it for want of a better name, is correct. This place consists of a small maidan on the southern side of the eastern extension of the Kacha range in ex ^ ent yards long by 250 to 300 yards broad. It is bounded on three sides by the Kacha river and on the fourth, t.e., on the northern side, by the range referred to The cultivation lies at the southern entrance of the gorge, which pierces the rang . through which the Kacha river flows, and it is situated about 150 yards east of the thana. The map accompanying this memorandum shows its position clearly. The cultivators have been informed that they have permission to cultivate such - land as they did last summer but that they should not extend its limits, at present, without sanction. The actual ownership of the Kacha land, itself, has never, so iar, been called in question and there would appear no likelihood of its being so. Levies. Two levies were posted here in July 1905 with orders to prevent the passage of Gulf rifles through the district. On their arrival at Kacha they repaired one of the rooms in the old thana and have lived in it ever since. They have been instructed to remain where they are and to request any Persian official who may put in an appearance to withdraw as his presence there is inadmissible. These orders were transmitted to the levies early in January and I satisfied myself by personal enquiry that they were fully acquainted with them. Recent events.—We have levied a tax for the past ten years on the Kakars who come from Zhob to collect asafcetida in this district. This tax has been taken on asafcetida cofiected within the limits of the * blue boundary line south of Kacha but never beyond or to the south of this; the water parting has always been regarded as the boundary. In the summer of 1903 certain Persian Bazgirs (tax-collectors), whose names are not forthcoming, levied grazing tax within this limit on some Dalbandin graziers who are British subjects. This action has been repeated on two or three occasions since. In March 1906 two bazgirs, named, respectively, Ibrahim and Kamalan, levied “ Rahdan on a caravan in the immediate vicinity of Kacha itself. In August last year five men visited Kacha. The party came from Duzdap and consisted of Juma Khan, Pasand Khan, Mamasani’s son, two bazgirs named, respectively, Kamalan and Hussain and they were accompanied by two followers. They informed the cultivators that they had been deputed to destroy their melon beds and they gave as their reason that this was because they were British subjects. The Kirtaka levy Duffadar was present on this occasion and he requested them to withdraw saying that Persian claims to the Kacha basin were not admissible and adding that if they resorted to force he would reluctantly be compelled to do likewise. They then returned whence they came after threatening to pay the Duffadar out. In October two bazgirs named Ibrahim and Kamalan demanded a tax from certain Zhob Kakars who had collected asafoetida on Mazawad and between^ that range and the northern spurs of the Bagh Koh. Payment was declined and ultimatly both parties, Bazgirs and Kakars alike, visited Saindak. The former claimed the right to collect taxes on all territory which lay south of the trade route which they alleged was the boundary between Persian and British Baluchistan. The Thanedar declined to discuss this surprising claim and the Kakars paid us the tax which was due from them. Towards the end of November the Persian Sultan Muhammad Hussain, who it will be remembered visited Piran in November and ejected the cultivators from there, sent word to Kacha that he proposed shortly inspecting that place and that if he found any cultivation he would destroy it. This threat was not carried into force.Prow 7h# Doputy Soorotory OovuniMeut of in the Foreign Dopertueut # ?h« Hon 1 Ole 31/ Ueu/y Ilol.eiiou, £«C*X«r 4 t 9 0«r»*X. # nfftmt to tlie Governor Oonorul urni.

Dispute had arisen concerning two plots of culturable land situated on vaguely defined boundary between Baluchistan and Sarhad at Piran and Kacha, about 30 miles south of Kuh-Malik-Siah. Both these places are situated almost exactly on the boundary fine as shown in our maps The Vice-Consul at Kuh-Malik-Siah reports that a small party of Sarbazes, under an officer belonging to the Kuh-Malik-Siah detachment, visited Piran with the object of expelling the occupants who belong to our Robat Levies, and that the land has been handed over to Persian subjects. On a reference being made to the Karguzar, he stated that Piran and Kacha both lay on the Persian side of the boundary line. Ihis, however, has been telegraphically denied by the Political Officer at Chagai. Pending decision of the question, the Karguzar has agreed to take no action. I would suggest that the Vice-Consul at Kuh-Malik-Siah be sent, if possible to report on position in company with some responsible Persian official. I he matter mioffit thus be settled without further difficulty. The Karguzar states that he cannot depute official himself, but has agreed to recommend this step. Ends. Extract from the Chagai Diary for weekending the 24th November 1906. 6 His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, lias telegraphed to the Political Affent to say that the Karguzar has lodged a protest in regard to the two Much post! which were established at Kacha Koh and Piran Ziarat so far hack as 1905. It would appear from the Consul’s wire that the Karguzar s Ten have actually ejected the Khassadars who were stationed at Piran on the ground thaTthey were in occupation of Persian territoiy. The Political Agent descredited this, as he had reoeived no intimation on the subject from Bobat, But in renlv to telegraphic enquiries which he has made it transpires that the Karguzar’s statement is correct, and that his men have actually done this. The PoUtical Agent has wired to ascertain the precise position which this post occupied. Telegram, No. S. 198, dated the 25th December 1906. From—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta, To—The Hon’blb Me.

Teleeram, dated 13th December, from British Consul in Seistan. I lease refer to Sir H. McMahon’s memorandum on the Perso-Baluch boundary question, also the enclosure of his letter of 5th November 1901, and map thereto annexed. The principles underlying the settlement which was ultimately arrived at by Sir A* Hardinge at Tehran, were that the boundary should not be specifically defined that the status quo should bo adhered to, and that no lurther claim should be made bv either side. The status quo meant the then existing condi tions of occupation by either side. The red line on map referred to roughly represents the limits of our occupation, and the present l ersian claim to Kacha and Piran is entirely opposed to the principles of the settlement, t he fact of our occupation of Piran admits of no doubt; and the Persian claim to Kacha is even less sustainable. The action of the Persian Sarbazcs in e xp&lt; 1- lin» our people is unwarrantable, and unless you see objection it is proposed to issue orders for restoration of the status quo by causing them to remove forthwith. The proposal put forward hy Lieutenant Daukea that the V ice- Consul and a Persian official should be sent to report on the position is undesir able, and might be taken as an admission of doubt on our part.

It is true a Persian party recently caused our levies, who have been posted at Piran since July last year, to leave the place.

Political Agent or Assistant will proceed to spot before Ion- to make enquiries and report further. Meanwhile, I do not recommend joint examination suggested by Seistan Consul, which seems inconsistent with Agreement of May last year, while a Baluchistan officer should be parly to any examination of the kind if it were necessaij.

I saw the Grand Vizier to-day and told him that forcible interference with the status quo by expulsion of British villagers by armed force had made it necessary for the Indian Government to issue orders for the restoration of quo by causing the intruding force to remove forthwith. Grand Vizier replied that the local authorities had acted without orders, and that he had telegraphed for an explanation. He added that he hoped the matter would be settled amicably on the spot without further discussion. I nresume there is no room for doubt that the villagers have actually been in occupation, and that we shall not claim more than maintenance ofstatu* quo.

From his report the position is shown to be as follows The exact boundary is difficult to determine as there are several ziarats adjacent to one another. Ihe land cultivated bv Chagai Levies has been extended this year, and if we assume that the boundary line passes through the principal ziarats it is possible that a few yards of Persian territory have been taken up. The Chagai Levies were dispossessed not only of this, but also of other plots of cultivation which are without doubt British territory. There was no Persian cultivation at Piran till November. Then cultivators from Persian village Duzdap were posted, and they are now in possession. There are no Persian Sarbazes at I iran.

I have the honour to forward herewith two maps of Mirjawa. 2.

The second map is one on a scale of 1'=4! miles of the country round Mirjawa. 4.

For this purpose, three separate traces are sent with the l - '=4-mile map and two traces with 2 /r =l mile map, the latter containing no hills. As the number of copies to be printedVill probably be few and the amount of blue and green colouring small, it may be found more convenient to paint in these two colours by hand. The figures of latitude and longitude in the l' r =4-mile map and the titles and notes in both maps should be inserted in proper type.

To explain the purpose of these maps, I attach copies of the marginally noted correspond ence between Sir Arthur Hardinge and myself. 6. I beg that copies of this map may be sent to Sir Arthur Hardinge. 7. I have endeavoured to throw some light on the topography of Mirjawa in my Diary entry of 25th May 1905, to which I invite a reference. 8. The 2'= 1 mile map shows the manner in which the dry bed of the Ladis or Mirjawa River splits up into innumerable and almost indistinguishable branches before reaching the bed of the Dar-i-Ghiaban nulla. It shows the difficulty of fixing upon any particular point as the junction of the Ladis or Mirjawa River and the Dar-i-Ghiaban. 9. There is no line at present recognised as the boundary from the Dar- i-Ghiaban to the watershed of the Mirjawa hills (vide Sir Arthur Hardinge*s telegram of 22nd May 1905), An arbitrary line drawn from any point on the Dar-i-Ghiaban, a little north of our Padaha post (Killa Safed) to the watershed, would probably suffice for all practical purposes. 10. I would suggest that a copy of this letter be sent to Sir Arthur Hardinge when forwarding to him copies of the above maps.VT- 5 Telegram, dated the 14th May 1905, from Sir Arthur Hardinge, Tehran.

There is a better known Padaha about three miles from Ladis and between that place and Mirjawa. Doubtless Persian Government are mixing up our new post with that place, which of course is well inside Persian territory.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith, in continuation of my telegram No. 65 of the 13th instant, a copy of the Agreement which I signed that day with the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, respecting the frontier at Mirjawar and the supply of provisions from Mirjawar, Ladis, and Seistan to the British outposts in North-A\ estern Baluchistan. The Article about the frontier is very brief. I had, in my original draft, inserted a clause defining the position of Padaha as situated on the Indian side of the boundary claimed by Persia,’ but, as the Mushir-ed-Dowleh said the Shah did not know exactly where Padaha was, and had made no claim in relation to it, I thought it advisanle, in view of the uncertainty' of our own right to it, not to draw too much attention to this point. I contented myself, therefore, with a recognition of out possession of it, and with the insertion of the provision—on which stress is laid in tba Viceroy’s telegram of the 27th February—that the question of the frontier in that region should now be deemed settled, and no further claim be made respecting it. The clause about our garrison at Padaha using “ buckets or waterskins^ to draw water from the tank at Mirjawar is, I need hardly say. of Persian origin. Ihe object of the Persian Government seems to have been to prevent our trying to claim a right to bring water by means of a “kanat,’’ or artiiicial channel, from Mirjawar to Padaha. I accepted it to please the Persians, though it reads rather grotesquely in a solemn diplomatic instrument. The total annual amount of grain obtained by me for our Indian frontier stations is, as your Lordship will observe, 2,200 Tabreez “ kharwars, or 200 more than the figure suggested by Colonel MacMahon it it should prove impossible to persuade* the Persian Government to remove the embargo altogether. I made* great efforts in this direction, and induced M. Naus to speak very strongly to the Ain-ed-Dowleh in support of mv representations, but his Highness, though lie relented a little and admitted that M. Naus was right in principle, said the embargo was an asset in the hands of the Persian Government, and should not be lightly given away. The concluding passage about customs duties and the non-export of grain from localities actually suffering from famine was insisted on by the Persians, but 1 insisted, on my side, on its being made clear that the harvest must lx* shown not merely to be threatened by inadequate rain, but to have been actually destroyed by locusts, blight, or some other exceptional visitation (such as a raid, a flood, or some such abnormal phenomenon), since otherwise the Governors would always pretend that there was a scarcity, so as to get the embargo put on and make money out of bribes paid to them by smugglers. . . I pointed out, and the Mushir-ed-Dowleh quite agreed, that these illicit gains by the local Governors were of no benefit to the Persian Government, and that it was high time to put a stop to them. I told his Excellency, at the same time, that the additions proposed by him in consequence of orders received from the Shah’s camp about customs and destruction of the crops, had not been submitted to your Lordship, and that though I thought you would accept them, 1 must make a formal reservation which would enable you, should you not approve of them, to withhold your assent to the arrangement in its present form, and I handed to him, before signing the Agree ment, the note of which I have the honour to inclose a copy herewith 1 should mention that we had arrived at a complete understanding on the 7th instant, the day on which the Shah left Tehran, and I was ready to sign next day, but the Mushir-cd-Dowleh insisted on sending the text ol the Agreement to the Boyal camp at Kerej for the Shah’s approval, and as the Court was on the move, it was not till the 13th instant that his Excellency was able to obtain an answer to a telegram which I had pressed him to dispatch on the subject. ^Meanwhile, Colonel MacMahon had telegraphed that he wanted to start not Inter than the 15th instant, and 1 therefore thought myself justified, in view of your [2030 e—2]Lordship’s orders to me, to make the best terms I eonld on the lines of flu; Viceroy’s proposals, to close with the Persian offers without further delay, especially as I had succeeded in obtaining a much larger export than was originally agreed to. I trust that, under these circumstances, my action will ho approved of by your Lordship. The Persian Government have asked me to supply them with a map illustrating the Mirjawar frontier as at present settled, and showing Mirjawar, Padaha, and the watering-places mentioned in the Agreement. I have telegraphed for one to Colonel MacMahon. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh also inquired whether a formal exchange of ratifications of the Agreement between the Shah and King-Emperor was in my opinion necessary, i have replied that as it was merely supplementary to the Jloldich Agreement, E thought that this formality would probably not he essential, hut that I would refer the point to your Lordship. I should be grateful for your instructions on the subject. I have been desirous of incorporating in some form or other as part of a general settlement of outstanding questions on the Seistan and Baluchistan frontiers, a provision cancelling the prohibition of the acquisition of “ Kholasajator State land in Seistan by British subjects, which was discussed in Mr. Grant Duff’s despatch to the Government of India on the 15th October last, and respecting which the Govern ment of India had desired me to make representations. I had accordingly raised the question in the note to the Persian Government of the 8th ultimo, of which I had the honour to forward a copy iu niv despatch to your Lordship of the IStli ultimo. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh, however, asked me not to press the point at the present juncture, lie said that a similar prohibition had been enforced in the Province of Astrabid, and that the Persian Government were now trying, in connection with the presence of our Boundary Commission in Seistan, to induce the Russian Government to withdraw the Russian Commission and escort from Gumbad-i-Kaboos, and to substitute for the permanent residence then* of a Russian Commissioner a system of meetings at stated intervals between the Russian and Persian frontier authorities, similar to those which have been instituted during the last few years for the settlement of border questions between the -Nazim of British Mekran and the Governor of Persian Baluchistan. He added, somewhat to my surprise, that the Russian Minister has shown a disposition to fall in with the proposal, and that the Persian Government hoped to arrange for buying back the buildings erected by the Russians at Gumbad-i-Kaboos, and was in the meantime trying to stop ( any fresh acquisition ot land or sites by the Russians in that district. I rather doubt any early agreement being arrived at on this subject, especially now that Colonel MacMahon is leaving Seistan, but I think it quite likely that the hints which I have sometimes dropped to the effect that we might reasonably ask for a Frontier Commission in Persian Baluchistan similar to the one at Gumbad-i- Kaboos, have been used by the Persians as a lever for obtaining the withdrawal ot the latter. I have, therefore, said that l would await the result of these negotiations before raising the question of our right under our Treaties to claim permission for our subjects in Seistan to acquire State lands for building sites or shops. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. P.S.—I have omitted in the above despatch to call attention to the fact that the Persian Government have neglected to fix the amount of ghee to be supplied from Mirjawar and Ladis, and have merely specified 50 kharwars a-year from Seistan. The matter was too unimportant to occasion a further delay in signing the Agreement as there is not, I believe, usually any restriction on the export of ghee, and this article was onlv mentioned, because Colonel MacMahon had specified a total of SO khar wars as* requisite for our posts along the Baluchistan frontier. If it should he necessary to provide for a definite supply of ghee from the Mirjawar district, this can he easily arranged by an exchange of notes. A. 11.

All the exports of grain and ghee will be liable to the payment of the customs duty levied on those of the most favoured nation.

His Excellency was at first a good deal disturbed by this discovery; at an evening party two days ago at the Turkish Embassy he took me aside and rather reproachfully implied that T had tricked him, saying that he would be held responsible for the recognition of Padaha as British in the Protocol of the 13th instant. He also sent for M. Nans, who reluctantly quitted a game of bridge, and asked him if it was really the case that Padaha belonged or ought to belong to Persia. If it did, and this was proved by the map which Colonel MacMahon had promised me, could not the arrangement we had just signed be altered. I explained, and so did M. Xaus, that the positions both of Mirjawar and of the British post at Padaha in relation to the Holdich boundary could only accurately lie verified by the delimitation on the ground itself, which both Governments had agreed in the Protocol of the 13th May to abandon. The boundary in question was an unknown line between two as yet unascertained points, viz., the junction of the so-called Talab and Mirjawar Rivers, and the nearest point (in a straight hue running from that inaction) on the Mirjawar watershed. It was conceivable that an accurate survey of this line might show Mirjawar to be just within British or Padaha just within Persian territory but the object of the Agreement which the Shah had ordered Ins Excellency to sign was to obviate the necessity of laborious inquiries into a question which was of no practical importance to either Government and to settle it on the basis of uii vossidetis. M. Naus observed that he thought it probable from our maps that 1 adaha was in Persian territory and certain that Mirjawar was not; but he admitted that the maos on which his conjecture was based were unreliable 1 he Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who reverted to the subject at an interview yesterday, is, I believe, a httle reassured by the explanations which have been given him, but I am inclined to think that it will be better not to propose any formal exchange of ratifications (even if such a course should be technically more correct) which would give the Persians any loophole for reopening 'The excessive sensitiveness displayed by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, who in thi&gt; reflects the views of the Shah, as to the possible alienation even of an acre of waterless desert (for he knows that Padaha has to get its water from Mirjawar) demonstrates, 1 venture to think, how impossible it would have been for me to induce the Persian Government to agree to Colonel MacMahou’s red line. One reason for this temper G of course the knowledge that Russia will exact compensation m the north for any slieht rectification made in our favour in the south-east. There is s ill a small strip of disputed boundary in Azerbaijan, in the celebrated plain of Mogau (where the election f V-ullr ‘stvih as King of Persia was ratified by the army and people), and the Einpeior o! Rifssia consenS on the occasion of his last, interview with the Shah to let this Question remain for the present open. The Mirjawar affair, as jour Lordship knows, ha, een attentively watched by the Russians, and I think it very probable that the acceptance by Persia of the red line would have been the signal for revived clauns by plL in the more valuable Mogan district. The Persians.a Russia in the more valuable .uogan uisirici. me ‘ ., at and would undoubtedly have obstinately insisted on the strict boundary. for revived claims any rate believe this letter of the Holdich I have, Ac.

As there is some prospect of the settlement of this portion of the boundary soon being taken up, I consider it advisable to note briefly the principal salient features of the question, and offer certain suggestions as to its treatment. 2. It is unnecessary to go into the details of the voluminous correspondence on this subject, which is cn record in the offices of the Government of India and the British Legation in Tehran. 3. The principal facts are briefly as follows When settling the Perso-Baluch boundary, Colonel Holdich based his infor mation, as to the northern portion of that boundary, on a map which, as proved by subsequent investigations, in no way correctly represented the country under consideration. His boundary line was defined in his agreement in accordance with that map, and a printed copy of that map,* with the boundary line drawn on it, and signed by both Commissioners, was delivered to the Persian Commissioner —vide paragraphs 45 and 46 of Colonel Holdich’s final report.f It is important to remember this, and to note the position of the boundary line shown in this map, relative to places such as Lar Koh and Mirjawa. The tracing, which is attached to Colonel Holdich’s final report, is not his agreement map, as supposed by some. It was prepared after his return to India. None of the northern portion of the boundary was visited or surveyed by either the British or Persian Commissioners. 4. The Persian Commissioner proposed to run the boundary line along the Talab X river to Durdap, and thence in a straight line to Koh-i*Malik Siah. 6. Colonel Holdlch, very unfortunately, did not take advantage of that proposal, but selected, instead, a line further east, on the supposition that it secured “a strongly marked and almost impassable frontier” (vide paragraph 9 Of his Report No. 35 of the 5th April 1896 and paragraph 41 of Report No. 77 of the 23rd June 1896). He considered that “no more perfect boundary than that afforded by mountains and river combined could be devised.” The inaccuracy of his information, and conclusions based thereon, is illustrated by the fact that the said mountains are in no respect impassable, and the river oh which he relies is incorrectly named. No Mirjawa river appears to exist. 2499 F. D. J So-called in Colonel Holdich'a agreement, but 1 believe the proper name is Tahlab. A. H. McMahon. 12 6. The English version of the boundary agreement of Colonel Holdich’a Mission includes the following clauses “ From pillar 11 northwards the Talab river becomes the boundary to its - junction with the Mirjawa river. I From the point of junction it is carried, by a straight line to the nearest point on the watershed of the Mirjawa range, which limits the drainage into the Mirjawa river on the north. “Thence it follows the main watershed northwards to the highest point of the Kaoha Koh. “ From the highest point of the Kacha Koh the line is carried straight to the highest point of the Koh'i-Malik 8iah.*' 7. The Persian version of the above clauses, to which the British and Persian Commissioners attached their signatures, reads somewhat differently, as follows :— “ From pillar 11 to the north the Rud-i-Talab has been fixed as the boundary to the junction of the Rud-i-Mirjawa,and from that place, in a straight line to the nearest peak of the Mirjawa range which is tbe limit of all the drainage from the north, to the Rud-i*Mirjawa, and from that place from the top of the peak of the Kacha Koh being drawn from the direction of the north will run to the end of height of the point of Kaoha Koh and from that place being drawn in a straight line it will run to the highest point of the Koh-i-Malik Siah.” 8. The Persian definition of the boundary by itself is unintelligible; but we must remember that a signed map was given to the Persian Commissioner illustrating the boundary. 9. The English version is intelligible, if we assume that, as shown by the Agreement map, by the Mirjawa river the Dar-i-Ghiuban is meant. If there is any Mirjawa river at all, it would appear to be the stream that flows down from Ladis, and in that case the boundary line would take off on the west bank of that river, and any attempt to reconcile its course onwards with the definition becomes hopeless. 10. Assuming that by the Mirjawa river the Dar-i-Ghiaban was meant, and that the junction of that river and the Talab river is the point where the Talab river first begins to be called by that name, there is no difficulty in trac ing a boundary line on the map in accordance with the English version of the boundary Agreement. 11. It will simplify further explanations to draw this line forthwith, in blue, on an accurate map,* i.e., Government of India North-West Trans-Frontier • I attach a copy of thi. map with the boundary ^ a ? xr \ ^^. 8= \ 8l ‘? efc L 1 N °* . ^ lines referred to in this Memorandum drawn N.-W., dated May 1902. This blue lin6» thereoa - awuv from the junction of the Mirjawa and *o*. Talab rivers, a point to be decided here after by local investigation on the spot, runs along the watershed from some point abreast of Mirjawa, as follows:— Through peaks 5998 and 5813, leaving Gurandi and Bug springs on the right. Thence, in a curved course to peak 6977, and onwards in a fignre of S, leaving peak 7157 and the Masawad and Bagh springs on the right, and Shorab Pass on the left, it passes through the Bagaiwad Pass to Peak 7033. Thence turning north-east, it runs to peak 7714, which is the highest peak of Kaoha Koh. From here, according to the definition, the blue line of boundary rune straight to the highest point of the Koh-i-Malik Siah, i.e^ peak 6392, on which boundary pillar No. 186 of the Baluch-Afghan boundary is erected. 12. From the highest peak of Kacha Koh, to near Mirjawa, the boundary line, as thus drawn, calls for but little remark, and is unobjectionable in itself. Near Mirjawa, however, it presents difficulties, for the straight line from the junotum of the Mirjawa and Talab rivers “ to the nearest point of the water shed ” is very likely to bring our Padaha post and well within Persian territory. There is considerable danger of this being the case, vide paragraph 29 below.V 3 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) (3) 13. From the highest peak of the Kaoba Koh onwards, the boundary line, as above drawn, is open to serious objections— It runs too close to our post at Robat to be convenient. The fort and spring are only 423 yards within British territory. It brings within Persian territory a valuable alternative route to Robat via Kacba and Bug Thanas and the Piran Spring. It brings the boundary line inconveniently close to the trade route, and includes in Persia several neighbouring springs of water in the valleys running down to that route, which would afford facilities to raiders and robbers. (4) Moreover, it may some day be of great advantage to us to own these upper valleys, in order ^o furnish British Officers and officials, who may hereafter have to be stationed at Robat, with some place near at hand where they can temporarily escape from the heat and unhealthiness of Robat in summer. 14. To continue the boundary line along the watershed of all the hills, north of Kacha Koh, draining eastwards into British territory, would necessi tate a line from peak 7033 (near Bagaiwad Pass) stretching far westwards to the crest of the Buzaf, Lakshak and Wawaila Ranges. This would bring the Persian routes from Seistan to Bampur, Ladis and Jalk, via Duzdap, within our territory and would naturally be strongly objected to by the Persians. 15. The line which gives us what we want, and does not interfere with the Persian routes, is as follows : i.e., from peak 7033 (near Bagaiwad Pass) along the main watershed to just beyond the Bandi Pass, and thence in straight lines or along the crests of ridges between nullahs, to Mina Bazar and the highest peak of Lar Koh (peak 7766) and thence in a straight line to the highest peak of the Koh-i-Malik Siab. 16 This line, to distinguish it from the blue line of Holdich’s boundary from Kacha Koh northwards, shohld, for facility of reference, be drawn in red and I will allude to it hereafter as the red line. It will be seen that this red line disposes of the objections attaching . I „» A. .ord'mor »-nttar o. A. n,.p, to ^ j t giyes „ „ boundary not only the western and main watershed of the Kacha river and its affluents, but the watershed also of the Piran river. 0 It leaves our Robat post 2,652 yards within our territory, instead of only 423 Yards as in the case of the blue line. 17. If it be remembered that the whole tract of country through which these blue and red lines are drawn is absolutely barren and uninhabited, it would not appear unreasonable to ask Persia to consent to the slight rectifica tion of boundary involved by the adoption of the red line. 18. The question for consideration now, is how this rectification is to be effected. The idea is entertained in some quarters that I may be able to obtain from the Persian Commissioner an interpretation of the Holdich agreement favourable to us, and this is based on the supposition that the Yamin-i-Nizam is not adequately provided with accurate maps and information, and may be found amenable to argument when brought face to face with the hardships attending deferred negotiations in that desolate tract. I myself held these views at first, but am now most thoroughly convinced that to base any hopes of success on the above supposition must only lead to disappointment. 19 I will naturally endeavour to make the most of the vagueness of the Persian version of the Perso-Balucb Boundary agreement, and the misuse of the name Miriawa river and, by claiming more than we want, try and get the Yamin-i-Nizam to agree to the red line, but I entertain no ^°P e of success. In the map given to the Persian Commissioner, Kacba Kob and Lar Koh are distinctly shown as separate ranges, and the Lar Kob is shewn thereon further within Persian territory than it really is. Moreover, the Yamin-i-Nizam, before my arrival in Seistan, was very carefully tutored by the Russian Consul in all that relates to this portion of the boundary. ms ' 7 ‘7 but it ntust be remembered that the Kacha and Pirar river* are dry torrent be^a with only oeeasioubl spring*, here and there, in their beds. A. H. McMiHOH. £20. The instruction* given to the Yamin-UNizam (vide Sir Aorthur Hardinge’s Despatch to Lord Lansdowne No. 72 of 20th May 1903, are so explicitly worded that it seems hopeless to expect him to take upon himself the responsibility of agreeing to any line more favourable to us than that of the Holdich Agreement and map. From what he has said from time to time on this subject, I know that he is afraid to depart, in any respect, from the letter of his instructions, and is fully determined to do nothing on his own responsibility. 21. At the most, I can succeed in bringing about a deadlock and hanging up demarcation work until references are made to Tehran. Beyond that, all that I can reasonably be expected to achieve by local diplomacy is to get the Yamin-i-Nizam indirectly to support my proposals by reporting that their adoption is not injurious to Persia. The nature of the country from Koh-i- Malik Siah to Mirjawa would render it very difficult for the Persian Commissioner to refer boundary questions in sufficient detail by telegram, and the interchange of letters and maps would probably be necessary. The time it will take, in winter, for letters to reach Tehran, and for replies to reach Mirjawa, will be two months or more, and it is open to question whether we should risk so much delay and expense. We may be able, with our large stock of supplies and transport, to maintain ourselves in that desolate country, but I feel sure the Persian Commissioner and his camp will not be able to do so, and this will mean his returning to Seistan out of reach of my influence, pending settlement of the question at Tehran. 22. I cannot well discuss the Perso-Baluch boundary question with the Persian Commissioner at the present juncture, as I have persistently refused to discuss even the Seistan water question until demarcation work is over. Moreover, there is the risk of the Afghans becoming aware of such discussion, and jumping to the conclusion that we are trying to obtain what we want in the Mirjawa direction at the expense of Afghan interests in Seistan. Any suspicions of this nature might place the good faith and impartiality of our Seistan Arbitration in a doubtful light and should, therefore, be carefully prevented. 23. We have, I think, good grounds, apart from those stated in paragraph 13, for asking the Persian Government to consent to the trifling rectification of the frontier involved by the adoption of the red line— (1) The terms of the agreement drawn up between the Governments regulating the manner in which the boundary was to be settled, have not been complied with by their Boundary Commissioners. The careful survey of the region adjacent to the frontier, prescribed in article 5, was not carried out, with the result that the present difficulty has arisen. (2) The Persian Commissioner, himself, proposed to fix the boundary along the Talab river to Duzdap; The boundary we now ask for lies, throughout, well to the east of that line. 24. We might, with justice, go further than the above, and point out that articles 3 and 4 of the agreement also were not complied with. The boundary line subsequently laid down does not “ follow as closely* as possible the line shown in the sketch map attached ** to the agreement, nor has any exchange of country been made to equalise in the interests of Kalat the concessions made to Persia. Moreover, the condition under which Colonel Holdich surrendered the Gorani date groves to Persia, t.e., t Major Shower* in hi§ »boTB.'report (p»r»jrr»ph 40) writes : “A con- 011 Understanding t dition under which the grores were abandoned to Persia was that the that the frontier Governors Damanis should be kept under efficient control. This was probably intended to be a sop to the Kekis, who had maoy complaints to make * In this connection paragraphs 39 to 46 of Major Shower’s report on hie tonr to Makran and M aet.kel iNo. 1166, dated 31et May 1902) should be read.

The condition, however, has not been fulfilled The Rekia at thia moment have 11 claims against the tribe (details given in Appendix 11, No. F.) all of later date than the 1«90 Com- mis*ion. On various grounds therefore, a claim for a reconsideration of this part of the Commissioner's proceedings might even at this date be not unreasonably pat forward.' of the Persian Government in future became responsible for the Damani cultivators of those groves ” appears to have been lost sight of.5 25. It will probably be considered too late to lay stress, at this stage, on the objections stated in the above paragraph, but it is not too late to use the arguments as propounded in paragraphs 23 and 24. zv 28. Instead of this Mission proceeding to the Mirjawa border and remain ing,* there for some indefinite period, pending references to Tehran, I would suggest that the small rectification of boundary proposed above be urged upon the Persian Government, forthwith, and that this Mission should, in order to avoid the difficulties and hardships of maintaining themselves in a barren uninhabited country, remain in Seistan, pending the settlement of the question. The Persian Government seems so anxious to see us depart from Seistan that, perhaps, they would willingly waive a point or two to expedite our departure. Actual demarcation itself, when once the course of the boundary line is settled, would take only a few days. 27. As for Mirjawa itself, its importance, strategically, has been fully dwelt upon by Major Showers in paragraph 41 of his report above quoted. This importance, as we know, has been thoroughly understood by the Kussian Government and, through them, is now fully appreciated by the Persian Government. Personally, I am inclined to think that the importance of the place has been somewhat over-rated, although there is no denying the fact that it is a well watered place close to our trade route, which, under certain, but still remote, conditions, might be made of great inconvenience to us. It is situated on the best and easiest route from Khorasan and Seistan to the Persian Gulf, but the strengthening of our Baluchistan border, and improved communications, would tend very largely to negative the value, in other hands, of a route passing so very close to our territory.) The importance to ourselves, or others, of Mirjawa, very largely depends on the course of future events in Seistan. The more our position with regard to Seistan is strengthened, the less and less important does Mirjawa become. 28. To obtain possession of it ourselves is a matter which obviously lies outside the scope of a local Demarcation Commission such as this, and is one 1 which, if taken up at all, can only be arranged by direct npgotiations, in Tehran, with the Persian Government. The analogy of Gumbad-i-Kaboos, and the surrender of Persian water rights to Russia at other points of the Russo- Persian border, would, jorima/ace^, afford a fair pretext for demanding some similar concession to us at Mirjawa, if such be desired. 29. I am not, however, called upon to discuss this question beyond so far as it concerns Padaha, where our new post has been built. Sufficient has been recorded by Major Showers of the topography of this tract to show fairly clearly that, in accordance with the definition and map of Colonel Holdich’s agreement, our post at Padaha is in imminent danger of finding itself within Persian territory. In the printed and signed copy of the North-West Trans- Prontier, 1 inch = 4 miles, sheet No. 14 8.-W. of November 1892, which forms the official agreement map, it will be seen that the junction of the so- i called Mirjawa and Talab rivers is shown some 7 miles south of Mirjawa. The boundary line shown on that map would bring the Padaha post some distance within Persian territory. I understand thht no suitable site exists in the neighbourhood to which our post could once more be removed and, even if it could, we may, I think, reasonably decline to add another to the many concessions which, unnecessarily or not as the case may be, have already been made by us in the matter of the Perso-Baluch boundary. 30. So much prominence has been given to Mirjawa and its neighbourhood, and Padaha has been so explicitly referred to in the instructions of the Persian Government to the Tamin-i-Nizam, that I foresee no possibility of making him agree to any boundary in this neighbourhood more favourable to us than that of the Holdich Agreement. Short of re-opening the whole question of the Perso-Baluch boundary, and demanding, on the strength of our recent surveys and enquiries, a rectification of the frontier which will give us Mirjawa in . return for concessions made to Persia further south, the only course open to us appears to be to press for such slight rectification of Holdich’s boundary as may be found necessary to include the Padaha post within our territory. 2499 F. D.6 31. This request would, of course, be based on the same arguments as those suggested for the red boundary line, paragraphs 23 and 24 above. There is one slight disadvantage in urging this request prematurely, as there is a chance, although a very poor one, of my being able to prove that our Padaha post is outside the Persian line. The procedure I have suggested in paragraph 3J» meets this difficulty. 32. The concession, by sale or lease, of a small plot (say 1 square mile) of oulturable land with water on the right bank of the Dar-i-Ghiaban—Talab river, for growing fodder and vegetables for the adjacent posts on our trade route has been stated to be very desirable. 33. The procedure which I venture to urge should be adopted, is that the Persian Government should he pressed, forthwith, to agree to the slight recti fication of frontier required for the adoption of the red boundary line, and to send the Yamin-i-Nizam necessary authority to demarcate accordingly. In the meantime this Mission should remain in Seistan. 34. If the above request does not include the necessary rectification of boundary at Padaha also, it should be so worded as not to preclude a further subsequent representation regarding the latter place, when I have, as I feel sure I will have, to refer the matter on arrival there. So little would then remain to finish up a long and weary business that not only would the Persian Commissioner be likely directly or indirectly to support my representations, but the Persian Government would, after giving in on the first point, be less likely to make a stand on the second and final one. 35. What appears to me to be a strong argument for tackling the Perso- * Baluch boundary question with the Persian Government direct, at Tehran, known to have embarked on that of the Perso-Baluoh boundary, Russian diplomacy at Tehran will doubtless be more wideawake and more actively directed than atf present towards thwarting our wishes in that direction. Sir Arthur Hardinge will know whether this argument carries weight, or not, and consequently whether it is better to include both the red line and Padaha in one representation, or take up the red line first, and await further reference before tackling Padaha. 86. A copy of this memorandum and of North-West Trans-Frontier map, • 4 inch=l mile, sheet No. 14 N.-W., dated 1902, with the red and blue boundary lines shown thereon, is being sent direct to His Britannic Majesty’s forthwith, without waiting for this Mission to leave Seistan and arrive at an impasst in Mirjawa, is that, when the Seistan question is settled up and we are Minister at Tehran.

The case of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk appears to have reached a deadlock. I now find that both Mr. Grant Duff and Colonel McMahon have recently expressed an opinion that he is not a worthy object of solicitude; and if it were not for the Russian attitude about him, which was a consequence of his action in the riots in 1903, we should not, in all probability, have committed ourselves to his support so strongly. It occurs to me that there is some hope of effecting an arrangement about Seistan affairs generally which the Persian Government might accept, and by w hich we should be gainers rather than losers. We might withdrawour objection to the removal of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk on condition that he was suitably provided for elsewhere ; that Persian Government give a promise in writing that they will recall the Yamin-i-Nizam on the withdrawal of the Jf^ssion; and that they will appoint and keep there a strong Governor to be approved by us. I should also like to include in proposed arrangement a satisfactory settlement at Tehran of the Mirjawa question (vide McMahon’s secret memorandum of 5th November 1904—enclosure of Secretary’s weekly letter No. 48 M., dated 1st December. If all these objects could be attained at once, we should be able definitely to promise a very early withdrawal of Colonel McMahon’s Mission, while Persian Government would have an oppor tunity of acting in accordance with the assurance contained in penultimate paragraph of Grant Duff’s letter of 26th October last.

The following telegram was sent to Colonel McMahon on 3rd January •— “Tour private letter of 12th November arrived during my absence in England. I do not belie\e that ve could ever induce the Persian Government to accept the red line. They would consult both the Russians and the Yamin- i-Nizam, and the result migh be their insisting on blue line, which is probably worse than the status quo. My idea would be to sugge&gt;t to them that if they behaved well as regards Seistan affairs, t. &lt;?., settled the case of the ilashmat-ul- Mulk and grain export questions to our satisfaction, we should be prepared as the Shah found in the presence of the Mission a source of anxiety, to Vith- draw it without exposing them and us to trouble and expense of a Mirjawa delimitation by it. W e would leave them Mirjawa itself, keeping Padaha ourselves, and treating the intervening stream as the boundary, and erectin ir a boundary pillar between Robat and Koh-i-Malik Siah to mark the boundary on the road. TV e should, however, ask for a definite agreement that we should be permitted to obtain supplies from Mirjawa and Duzdab. “ If you tell them that the rectification proposed is insignificant, they will reply ‘ why then do you attach importance to it’? It would be injudicious to admit weakness ot our case, and, on the other hand, to try to deceive, would end in failure and increase their suspicions of us. “ I am writing in this sense to India, but would be glad of a telegram from you”. The following telegram arrived from Colonel McMahon on 6th Janunry •— “January 6th. Your telegram, 3rd January. Failing red line, I concur in thinking that the status quo would be preferable, from our point of view, than the blue line, but do not Persians already recognise this, and would not our willingness to forego demarcation be considered to be an admission of weakness of our case ? “ I have a suspicion that the Persians will not readily agree to defer demarca tion, as they have been led to expect benefit from it, and I also expect that the Yamiu-i-Nizam has been given orders to take advantage of our o-oin^ to Mirjawa to settle Persian accounts with the Sarhadis, &amp;c., of those parts” 3 “ If we confine ourselves to attempt to wriggle out of Holdich’s definition of northern portion of the boundary line, our case is a very weak one, but is it not13 a fiirlv stron- one if w-open c^e with tliroat of general attack on whole leno- Baluch boundary settlement, on line of argument suggested in paragraphs 23 and 21 of mv memorandum, and thus make them willing to accept slight rectification r^ uired as the lesser of two evils ? The rectification is ins.gnificant, if the value to Persia of the small barren uninhabited track in question is considered, but the adaptation effected thereby of the paper boundary line, as laid down in lioldich’s inaccurate map, to the existing country, to suit requirements of a lasting and workable boundary line, might be argued to be important to Persians as well as ourselves. Should it be necessary to ask for any agreement, such as you suggest, at the time of demarcation of the line, it should include permission for Pndaha post to draw water from Mirjawa as hitherto. Little or no supplies are obtainable in Mirjawa, and none still further. Duzdab towl- supplies are mostlv drawn from Ladis. My letter to Grant Duff, dated 6th December, regarding the Uashmat-ul-Mulk, indicates some ot the risks involved if the Mission is deprived of its privileged diplomatic character. If we are used as a lever to help on the settlement of the questions you suggest which are outside the original purpose of Mission, would not the resulting difficulty and anomaly of our position here give the Amir serious trouble ? Might I suggest Aour telegraphing vour views regarding Mirjawa question to India instead of writing for, as already explained in my telegram &gt;»o. 871 of 3rd January, I wouldTike to defer my water award, if possible, until we are in a position to leave Seistan”. , Following sent to Colonel McMahon, 9th January ■.-lle g m». Tour telegram I have sent to India my telegram of 3rd January and your s of Ml. Janaarv. 1 do not think the willingness to forego demaroati m need suggest that onre.se is weak if we get a good quid pro quo.

If, after receipt of my despatch of 6th January, you still desire me to press for the boundary marked by the red line, 1 will do my best to obtain its adoption by the Persian Government, but the great difficulty will, in my opinion, be that the Russians will insist that it involves a real rectification of frontier to our advantage, and will consequently claim an equivalent on the northern frontier.

Sir, I have the honour to submit 23 Tehran, 6th January 1905. A To Colonel McMahon. 1 st January. herewith a copy of a telegram which I addressed on the 1st instant to Colonel isi j anuarj. McMahon embodying my views on his latest communications respecting the Mirjawa boundary and more especially hhfdemi-official letter to you of the 1st of November las as to whtch my opinion is, I understand, desired by the Government of India. I had hoped before the departure of my messenger to-morrow to be in receipt of a reply from Colonel McMahon whom I had asked for his observa- ttons on this tele-ram, and it is possible that I may still receive one. I hardly think however '’that any fresh information winch he may give me will sub- stanti’ally modify the view which I have expressed in the enclosed message. So far as I understand the situation, an exact delimitation of the frontier line laid down in the Holdieh agreement will not only not strengthen our e aim to Miriawa and Duzdab, both of which Captain M ebb Ware believed he ^ould nclude within our territory, but will give us a hne-the blue Trntenfll McMahon’s map-which would he less satisfactory than the su Pll osed present one“ueh aTit will, amongst other things, bring the Persian frontier Fo the very doors of our fort at Robat Killa, and perhaps to a point east of our nresTnt pit at Padaba. Colonel McMahon proposes, in lieu o it, a line marked ^ nri hk rmu which he does not believe he could induce his Pers.au ‘clique the Yamin-i-Nizam, to recommend to the Persian Government, but w5 he thfnkstTmight perhaps persuade the Ain-ed-Dowleh to accept. There are two wavs by which I might, I presume try to carry my point. I mi-lR contend that the red line was the one really in harmony with the . 3 . ■■ .i p ii n ] i;,.h agreement, and trust to the ignorance and indifference intentions ol tlm Uo dich a ue h tlle i atter i D a ra0 re straight- f lifSo^Tototout thaTthe telt of the agreement did not correspond 0r tl the known intention of the Commissioners, and ask them to agree to the red lme on the ground that the rectitication involved in it, though of no conse- ifi/f f I ^local conditions to say whether the places marked in Colonel McMahon’s map as Hu* Thana, Bedi Spring, and Piran Ziarat, and shown to he on the lersian side of the blue line are, de facto, held or c*laim&lt;*d by us. ar o •° W ' their occupation by us will probably be left unchallenged by the rersians unless the whole question is re-opened. As regards Robat, it could perhaps be ^ arranged locally, at some later date, when the talk about the revision and real meaning of the Holdich agreement has subsided, to erect a boundary pillar at some point on the road from Hurmak not too close to our Thana, say, a mile or half a mile from it, in order to indicate for the benefit of travellers, and for the settlement of any uncertainties as to jurisdiction, the exact point on the trade route at which the two territories meet. This arrangement would be made as a matter of mutual convenience, and without reference to a line only verifiable with difficulty, running from the Kacha Koh to Koh-i-Malik Siah. I might, however, state to the Persian Government that, in return for a formal abandonment of our claim to Mirjawa, i. e. t the point occupied by the Custom House, and for the withdrawal of Colonel McMahon without the re-opening of any further boundary disputes, we should ask for the definite settlement of certain questions in Seistan, such as that of the export of grain, and also for the permanent right to draw supplies and water from Mirjawa for our neighbouring outpost at Padaha. I could probably effect an agreement on these lines, including perhaps a right of free supply from Duzdab without the intervention of the Yamin-i-Nizam. Colonel Douglas, with whom I have discussed the subject, agrees with Colonel McMahon in holding that the whole Mirjawa-Robat boundary is mainly important in subordinate relation to Seistan, and that the acquisition of the red line would be valuable to us only in the event of the establishment, by Russia, of paramount influence in Seistan and Persian Baluchistan. Since I sent my telegram to Colonel McMahon, I have received a repetition of the one from the Government of India to Mr. Secretary Brodrick of the 3rd instant, in which it is suggested that a satisfactory settlement of the Mirjawa boundary might be effected as part of an arrangement which could comprise a withdrawal of our support of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. As to this, I think that the two questions might be treated in connection with one another, but I fear that anv formal cession of territory which the Persian Government could be per suaded, whether by its own officers or by the Russians, was demonstrably its own, would ’be very difficult to obtain. An exchange might be possible, but a recti fication however trifling, to the detriment, or apparent detriment, of Persia, would have practically no chance of success. Unless, therefore, we can make sure that the re-opening of the question will give us a more satisfactory line than the Holdich one, we had better adhere to the latter, inaccurate geographically as it is, rather than run the risk that further enquiry will involve the substitution of the blue line of Colonel McMahon’s latest map. I have the honour to be, Sib, Your most obedient, humble servant, A. H. Hardinge. The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.18 Telegram, No. 731 F., dated the 27th February 1905.

'We should prefer to press for the recognition of red line marked by Colonel McMahon on his map, but in view of the diffi culties foreseen by Sir A. Hardinge in securing the agreement of the Persian Government to this, it may be thought wiser to accept the alternative put forward in Sir A. Hardinge’s telegram to Colonel McMahon, dated the 3rd January, On withdrawal of Mission we shall probably have to establish levy post at Robat for purposes of observation. Great importance attaches to withdrawal of restrictions on export of grain from Seistan and formal consent of Persian Government to our taking water from Mirjawa for Padaha post , and obtaining supplies from Ladis, is essential to settlement. If Mirjawa question is thus settled, it is understood of course that Persia will not revive question of boundary in these parts. If you concur, please instruct Hardinge accordingly.

His Highness objected tq (1) on the ground that he wished to unite Seistan and Kain into one province with a new Governor independent of Meshed and directly subject to Tehran. I suspect that the new Governor will be either the Yamin-i-Nizam or the Mustansir-ul-Mulk^ with the sons of tho Shaukat and Hashmat as his deputies at Birjand and Nasratabad, respectively. Eventually ho pledged himself to give the This was not cyphered. The cypher came either H as l lina t-ul-Mulk either Seistan * proper Proper or Tabas. or Tabas which the Persian Government will probably prefer as a separate Government. He agreed in principle to (2), but asked for details which I said I would - supply on hearing from Your Lordship if you on your part accepted this compromise. At the same time I reminded him that my orders from you were to insist on the reinstatement of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk in Seistan. The latter would taly(Kam, but may not care so much about Tabas. I also understand that our local officers now regard both Yamin and Mustansir-ul-Mulk as friendly. On the other points mentioned in my telegram No. 32, VHh March, I am making by sustained pressure a little headway. He has asked me not to add to his°difficulties during his present struggles with Russians, but has admitted that we have been forbearing.

Persian Government have made following verbal reply to my note of 8th April, em bodying proposals as to Seistan and Mirjawa questions:— (1) The abandonment of further delimitation is agreed to, and our posts ’ at Padaha and elsewhere may take water from Persian territory. (2) ihe Persian Government agree in principle to the export of supplies for Robat and other British posts, but they wish a definite amount fixed, and are disposed to regard as excessive that which was suggested by Colonel McMahon as the yearly minimum, namely, 2,000 kharwars of grain and 80 of ghi. This point is still being discussed between us. (3) Acquisition of Crown lands by foreigners {vide Government of India despatch of 18th January). The Persian Government ask that this demand be postponed on the ground that they have enforced the prohibition in Asterabad province, whereas in Seistan most land is Crown. They are nego tiating with Russia for withdrawal of Gumbad-i-Kabus Commission, 1 suspect, by saying we claimed similar rights in Seistan, and for the repurchase of Russian buildings, and it is with this object that they profess to have issued the two prohibitions mentioned, which they hinted are only temporary. They have received a telegram from Yamin-i-Nizam to the effect that Colonel McMahon’s water award is very detrimental to Persian interests, and they are telegraphing to him for explanations. I have said that Colonel McMahon has not yet sent me copy, but that I will telegraph to him also, and hope to discuss the question w ith them in a day or two. I have a draft of Colonel McMahon’s award, but he does not want this to be known. They would wish him to remain in Seistan a short time longer until this issue is cleared up.

In view of difficulties which will arise, and other difficulties which the effect of my departure may have on those left, I would prefer to remain myself; but in recognition of the necessity for eliminating henceforth from Mission all elements of arbitration character, I would suggest Macpberson being placed in charge, either permanently or until fresh officer is appointed. By recalling supplies sent ahead, there will be sufficient for three and-a-half months’ consumption from now, but, after that, difficulties in purchase will doubtless arise. To meet the political, clerical, and accounts work, which supply and other questions involve, it would not be advisable to reduce the native political staff, except perhaps by one Native Attache.

I am still trying for removal of embargo absolutely, or, fail ing that, for the 2,000 kharwars which Colonel McMahon asked for: but if Shah adheres to 1,500, shall I accept this, or should proposal be held to have fallen through, and Commission remain on frontier this summer to delimit next cold weather in Baluchistan ? As Shah leaves on 7th May, please renlv as soon as possible. J ^ ^ I am informed by Mushir-ed-Dowleh that Russians have pledged them selves, both here and at St. Petersburgh, to withdraw their permanent Com mission and guard from Gumbad-i-Kabus, and to substitute special meeting at intervals between Russian and Persian Commissions on frontier similar to those held between Alakran and Rampur authorities. He admitted having intimated that McMahon would not leave Seistan until this was agreed to. ° Addressed to Foreign Office; sent to McMahon and India. Enclosure No. 32.

I have sent the following message to the Foreign Office, London, and have repented it to Colonel McMahon:— Begins. Please refer to my telegram No. 57 and your telegram No. 45, regarding the Bunder Abbas telegraph, and Mirjawa. 1 have just signed with Mushir-ed-Dowleh an agreement respecting Bunder Abbas telegraph extension and grain export to the Indian frontier. 'J he former is identical with that sent to the Foreign Office in my despatch No. 6i, dated 29th March, plus provision for Persian Office at Hen jam and English telegraphist for State messages at Bunder Abbas. Latter stipulates (1) withdrawal of our claim to Mirjawa and our right to obtain water from tank or wells at Mirjawa or near. (2) Abandonment by l&gt;otti Governments of proposed re-examination of boundary line in that region which is declared to be definitely settled, and respecting which no further claim will be made. (3) Permission to people of Duzdab, Ladis, and Mirjawa to sell supplies to our frontier outposts up to 700 Tabriz Kharwars of grain a year, and unrestricted annual export from Seistan of 1,500 Tabriz Kharwars of grain and 50 of ghi for Robat post and Nushki road, that is, 2,200 Kharwars a year. Exports are liable to Custom duties levied on those of most-favoured-nation. Provision applies to all normal years, but will not be complied with from any locality which can be shown to be actually suffering from famine due to destruction of crops by locusts, blight, or other exceptional visitations. As McMahon was pressing to start on the 15th May, and you had told me to get the best terms I could, I signed, without referring to you, several details in which Persians had modified ray original draft, but have put in a reservation enabling His Majesty’s Government, if it disapproves of these modifications, to withhold its assent from the arrangement.

H. Holdich, C.B., C.I.E., R.E., Her Majesty s British Commissioner, Perso-Baltich Frontier, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, No. 77'T.H., dated Simla, the 23rd June 1896. I have the honour to submit the following detailed report of the proceed ings of the Perso-Baluch Boundary Commission in continuation of my prelimi nary report dated 5th April 1890. 2. In accordance with instructions contained in a secret letter from Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, dated 30th December 1895, which was duly received bv me as indicated in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Department » letter No. 160-E!, dated 20th January 1890, the demar.-ation of the Perso-Baluch frontrier has been completed from the neighbourhood of Kohuk to the Jalik Siah Koh. 3. One copy of the agreement, synopsis and maps has been made over to the Persian Commissioner for confirmation at the court of Tehran, and the second copy was forwarded to the Foreign Office under separate cover from Panjgur on April 5th. 4. The British Commission consisted of the following officers : Colonel T. H. Holdich, C.B., C.I.E , R.E., CAtef Commissioner. Captain C. A. Kemball. I.S.C., Assistant Commissioner. Lieutenant-Colonel R. Wahab, R.E., Survey Officer. Lieutenant Price, Commanding Escort. Surgeon-Lieutenant Turnbull, *n medical charge, with Surveyors Ahmad Ali Khan Bahadur and Hussein Bux as assistants to Colonel M ahub. 6. All arrangements were complete for the mission by the 20th January, on which date the party left Karachi for Gwadur by the telegraph steamer Patrick Stewart. But little difficulty was experienced in landing at Dwadur, and sufficient camel transport was available for the carriage of the party and one mouth’s supplies in the course of a few days. Previous notice had been sent to the Makran districts (through which the Khan of Kalat, accompanied by Lieutenant LeMesurier, Political Agent at Kalat, was then travelling) that camels would be required for the Commission ; and every effort had been made by the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs to coUect them at G wadur as rapidly as possible ; otherwise there would have been very great delay in effecting a start from Gwadur. 0. We left Gwadur for the interior on the 1st February, and after a rough march of 20 days across the strike of the barren and rugged Makran 1 rentier hills, during which we were occasionally unable to make better piogiess than from 8 to 10 miles a day, we reached Kohuk on the 20th. 7. It should be noted that by far the best route into the interior from the coast is that which starts from Pasni and proceeds through Kej. Pasni has however, the disadvantage of being in itself an insignificant village compared to Gwadur, and it possesses no telegraph office. I he harbour accommodation is about equal in both ports. 8. At Kohuk it became necessary to decide on some definite method of work in order to complete the 300 miles of boundary that had to be demarcated before the rapidly approaching hot weather should put an end to nedd 8Ur y®. v ' ing. The records of General Goldsmid’s Seistan Commission made it clear that in order to deal successfully with Persian officials it was necessary to be abso lutely independent of them in the matter of supplies and assistance, and to push forward field work as rapidly as possible. The experience of years of previous surveying in this country had also taught me that after the middle it would be hopeless to expect continuous clear weather, even should it be possible to keep the field in the desert portions of the district on acc0ll ^ lt the scarcity of water. Every consideration therefore urged as rapid a system of demarcation as could be adopted with all due regard to the necessity of2 •©curing a strong and readily recognisable boundary line. Fortunately the whole area under discussion had already been surveyed by members of my S arty, and the published maps were quite sufficiently accurate to enable me to ecide what line would constitute a sound boundary consistently with the instructions received from the Government of India, before the actual com mencement of demarcation. 9. Had it been practicable it would have been a valuable assistance to our future extension of geographical surveys could we have carried exact triangulati&lt;&gt;n along the whole length of the line from Kohuk to Malik Siah Koh. But such an extension, even under favourable circumstances, could not have been efficiently carried out in less than four months, even in favourable weather. Apnrt from such geographical considerations, there was no necessity to do more than re-examine the published maps, and to add fresh details to our topography in the near neighbourhood of the boundary line. Even this pro mised to be a slow process, unless the survey party could be broken up into detachments, and demarcation commenced from both ends of the line at once, a method which I hardly anticipated that the Persian Commissioner would approve. 10. As regards the actual process of delimitation I had the advantage of experience as a guide to the best method of demarcation in uncivilised dis tricts, and it may be as well to state here the general principles adopted. The best and most recognisable natural boundary is a well-defined watershed ; the higher and more inaccessible the better, but whether high or low, it is one which every trans-border savage recognises instructively and which he feels to be immoveable. Rivers or watercourses are occasionally good features to adopt, good when hedged in between unchangeable banks, or when passing through absolutely uncultivated districts, but especially to be avoided where there is cultivation on both banks and agricultural interests divided by the stream. When artificial methods are a necessity, the only alternative is to erect pillars at all important points and to fix their position accurately by a survey process. The pillars themselves are only of value under very excep tional circumstances, t.e., when they define limits within cultivated areas, and when it is distinctly to the interest of both parties to the agreement that they should be preserved. It is only under such conditions that they may be expected to last any length of time. To erect pucka pillars in the wilds of southern Baluchistan is as certain to invite their destruction as it has proved to be in Sikkim. Even in the near neighbourhood of Quetta it has been found impossible to preserve the survey marks and pillars, and it is only by constant vigilance and frequent visits that one or two stations of paramount importance have been preserved intact. Unnecessary pillars should never be erected unless their safety can be secured, as the destruction of them may, and does, lead to the erroneous idea that the boundary itself has been impaired or destroyed. 11. But apart from the temptation afforded to any casual trans-frontier out law to insult the British Government by the destruction of carefully erected boundary marks, there are natural causes which tend to destroy such artificial erections quite as surely as human vindictiveness or love of mischief. In desert tracts where sand dunes form, and where sand is almost always on the move under the influence of unceasing wind, every pillar becomes the neucleus of a fresh sand hillock, and the process of its disappearance is extremely rapid. Weather action too effects them unless built with great solidity ; and the only possible means of securing the permanence of a pillar marked boundary in open and comparatively desert districts would be to organise a special service of boundary runners similar to the linesmen of the Telegraph Departments, whose duty it would be to pass constantly along the boundary and keep it in repair. But the cost of such a service would be prohibitive ; and it is therefore best, on the whole, to avoid pillar boundaries as much as possible. Where this is impossible the best class of boundary mark to adopt in such dis tricts as Baluchistan is a large loose pile of stones such as were erected in the Waziristan border. There is an unfortunate superstition amongst Baluchis that the erection of cairns on high hilltops interferes with the rainfall, and3 (nr tills •SMU there is a stsiidiiie ohjretion to li^fVaret, ire - ,b ‘ CDantry attract no specially hostile attention. 12. With the ever present possibility of the totel ° 0 f ^heir cial landmarks there arises the necessity for careful ditioD w hieh position by co-ordinate values in the lat, ude f^'^^j^biounder favour- implies an exactness of survey process which “ onl y themselves able conditions of time and cl, mate.

It was these considerations which decided which • jine of boundary from the Malik Siah a9 wou i d rend er artificial de- *• iliould be marked by such strong na u ^ ^ ft pp roac h to Seistan marcation unnecessary ; whibt at the . preserved by shifting the line from the direction of Kharan might be be ter water ^ed of the of the Tehran agreement y estv ' ar(i , f r 01 ®, • h beeil surveyed by members hiUs.

With the object of demarcating this line (should it be accepted by thd Persian Commissioner) a special survey paity was equipped and held ready for a rapid march to the Malik Siah Koh as soon as the Persian Commission should arrive at Kohuk. Thus demarcation from the northern end of the line could proceed southM ards whilst the southern section was being demarcated north wards. There bein' no second survey officer with the Commission, and Colonel Wahab’s services being indispensable for the demarcation of the Mashkel date- groves, Khan Pahadur Ahmed A li was placed in charge of this section of the survey, and it was intended that he should be accompanied by a fully qualified Persian representative. \ 17. On the 25th February the Persian Commission arrived at Kohuk in cluding the following officers :— Mirza Ali Asraf, Itisbam-i-Wazireh, Chief Commissioner. Zainul-Abadin, Asad-ud-Doulah, Governor of Persian Baluchistan. Prince Suliman Mirza, Scientific Adviser and Surveyor. With the Persian Commission there was an escort of a company of infantry and one mountain gun. The Asad-ud-Doulah also brought with him his private band from Bampur. „ xm 18 o Tw ° dayS P revioU8 40 the anrival of the Persian Commission Captain P. M. Sykes of the Queen’s Bay’s, Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, joined the head-quarters of the British Commission as Assistant Commissioner. He was m time to give valuable information and advice about the members of the Persian Commission (all of whom were known to him personally) previous to their arrival. ^ r 19. The British camp was pitched on the Kalat side of the river Mashkel opposite Kohuk, and it was entirely independent of all Persian sources of supply either for food or forage. The Persian camp remained on the Kohuk side and was practically under command of the Asad-ud-Doulah. 20. As this apparently divided responsibility within the Persian camp largely influenced the proceedings of the Commission, it is as well to explain here that the Persian Commissioner was absolutely dependent on the Asnd-ud-Doulah for supplies, escort and equipment. Although he was the Shah’s representative he was, at so remote a distance from Tehran, practically in the hands of the local Governor, who could direct his movements almost as he pleased. Whilst personally responsible for the successful demarcation of the boundary, the Itisham was never independent of the opinion of this local functionary,’ who could at any time withdraw his support, suppress all correspondence, and make his own private representations to the Tehran Court of the Commissioner’s proceedings. 21 . So far as the demarcation of the boundary from Kohuk to Mashkel was concerned, no difficulty was apprehended from any action of the Asad-ud- Doulah, who had met Captain Kemball on the Makran frontier last year, and had shown a friendly disposition towards the British Government, and a general inclination to settle border disputes amicably and equitably. Behind him, at Kerman, was the Ferman-i-Farma, the Governor of all South-eastern Persia, who alone could bring pressure to bear upon him as the real Viceroy of the Shah. The Prince who at present fills this high post, has always exhibited a most exceptionally favourable attitude towards the British Government. He has repeatedly assisted English officers and native surveyors travelling on duty m his country, and there can be little doubt that his often expressed wish to be fnends with England is perfectly sincere. But for his influence in the present instance and the frequent correspondence which he maintained with Captain Sykes (with whom he is on terms of intimate friendship) and with the members of the Persian Commission, it may well be doubted whether our success would have been so speedily attained. 22. But the influence of the Farman-i-Farma (and consequently of the Asad-ud-Doulah) extended no further north than Ladis. Beyond that district to the Malik Siah Koh the local Governorship is that of the Amir of Kain (or Chain), who is himself subject to the Governor of the Khorassan, the capital of which, Mashad, is the head-quarters of a Russian as well as of an EnglishConmiPT The Amir of Kain is believed to be favourable to British interests, but not much was known about him, and I looked forward with some appre hension to the total change in the constitution of the Persian Commission which would be introduced should the Persian Commissioner decide that it was necessary for the joint Commission to proceed to Bialik Siah Koh ore demarcating the boundary between Ladis and that point. Not 0D jy wou there have been a complete change of the base of operations from one Governor ship to another involving preliminary references to Tehran, and months ot delay, owing to the dependent position of the Itisham, but the British camp would hare lost much of its independence when compelled to march throngli Persian territory at a distance from the border ; and further it was not clear what might be the result of those references to Mashhad \*hicn wou a certainly have been made as proceedings dragged in through the summer months. A change from the sphere of influence of the tarmaii-i-Farina to that of the Governor of Khorassan at Mashhad was certainly to be avoided if Y\r\cfil hi 6 23. The first difficulty (and the greatest, as it turned out) raised at the meeting of the two Commissions was the question of precedence; and this narrowed itself to the practical issue of which of the two Commissioners should call first on the other. Jn the eyes and understanding of all the local Chiefs throughout Southern Baluchistan this was the actual test of relative onicial dignity and influence, and it was natural that the Persians, to whom rank and precedence is the first consideration of existence, should make much of it. The Itisham was quite prepared to concede the ripht of the British representative to receive the first visit, but the Assd-ud-Doulah, as a Provincial Governor, raised strong objections, insisting that as the British Commissioner only ranked as Colonel m the army, he (the Asad) could not be expected to make me first salaam. He was informed that unless he accompanied the Itisham on his first official visit to the British camp, his presence would be ignored altogether; and Tehran influences, through the Earman-i-Earma, were sufficiently strong at this period to induce him finally to comply. To the credit of the Asad it must be said that he did so with fairly good grace, and that for some time subsequently he refraii ed from makii g protests against the boundary settle ment except in a sort of pro formd manner which indicated that he did not expect much attention to be paid to his objections. 24. The interchange of official visits was made on the 26th February, and the next day the first official meeting of the Joint Commissioners was arranged. At this meeting I took advantage of the favourable relatkns which had already been established between the two Commissions to introduce the question of' the boundary settlement as a whole, and to discuss the possibility of dealing with the northern section of it beyond Ladis at the same time as we settled the more important issues connected with Kohuk and the Mashkel groves. I found my colleague more than ready to meet my wishes. He was as much impressed as myself with the dangers that might attach themselves to delay, and I now think that he was really relieved to find that I had no intention of insisting on the change in the constitution of the Persian Commission that would be involved by shifting the united camp from the ICerman Governorship to that of Khorassan. He showed much intelligence in survey matters, and his previous experience when working with English surveyors induced him to accept our mapping as it stood in our published maps (sheets 15 N. K., 14 8. E., 14 8. W. and 14 N. W.) with all confidence; although he was fully aware that in matters of minor detail, not affecting any important part of the boundary settlement, there might be much to be added and improved in chose maps. For my own part I was suffi ciently assured of their general accuracy. They had been prepared by some of my ablest assistants with all the advantage of cold weather atmosphere and ample opportunities. The Itisham agreed to the proposal to send a, nying survey party to demarcate the line provisionally adopted, as already indicated, and to test the accuracy of details; and he promised to nominate a high Persian official to accompany the party in order to confirm the final reports as to the nature of the districts north of Ladis. This however depended on the assistance of the Asad-ud-Doulah, and that functionary finally failed to make proper arrangements.6 25. Thus the one great difficulty which it appeared might probably lead to long delay and protracted operations through the hot weather months, *hen water and supplies would be procured only with the greatest trouble through Persian Agency, and which might finally (as it afterwards turned out) have led to a temporary abandonment of demarcation on the death of the Shah, as happily removed at the outset. For no further discussion was ever raised as regards the northern section of the boundary. Our maps and reports were accepted unquestioned, and the provisional boundary was finally adopted permanently with but slight modification. 26. The total length of boundary demarcated was about 290 miles, of which rather more than half belong to the northern section between Malik S : ah Koh and the Mashkel hamun. The demarcation of the southern section from pillar 1 on the Mashkel river was commenced^ on the 28th hebruary in accordance with the agreement made on the basis of the maps with the Itisham. On the 26th, pillar No. 1 was erected by a working party drawn from the Baluch sepoys of the 30th Bombay Infantry, who formed our escort, and was officially inspected by both Commissioners on the 29th, Colonel Wahab (accompanied by Prince Buliman Mirza) was detached with the survey party to visit the Siahan range, and to commence fresh triangulation if possi &gt;le, whilst making a close J-inch survey of the actual boundary as a check on the mapping. All arrangements were completed for the forward march of the two camps to Jalk (level with which point the position of the boundary had been fixed at our first meeting) which commenced on the 1st and 2nd March respectively, the Persian camp preceding that of the English by one day in order to avoid too much drain on the scanty water-supply. 27. Demarcation proceeded rapidly and satisfactorily up to pillar which was placed exactly half-way between Jalk and Ladgasht as indicated in the Tehran agreement; and on the 14th at Jalk, a second official meeting was held which practically concluded our agreement as to this southern section. 28. The route taken by the Commission between Kohuk and Jalk followed the Mashkel Valley upwards as far as Isfandak, crossing the spurs of the Siahan range on the left bank of the river, and being flanked to the north by the watershed which now forms the boundary between Kalat and Persia. The road was rough and the gradients of the successive spurs were steep, and ^vater was scarce and brackish even in the river bed. At Isfapdak we found a clear running karez with excellent water, and thenceforward, till our return journey brought us again to the same encampment, we had no further dimcnlty about water. From Isfandak the route carried us straight northward to the Bunsar, the best known of all the passes across the Siahan. Considering the quality and configuration of the range which it crosses, the pass is an easy one. The descent on the northern side was as easy as the ascent from the south, and we passed at once from the barren wilderness of the southern Siahan slopes into the green luxuriance of the Kalagan Valley. 29. Here were forts and villages with acres of rich cultivation, groves of palm-trees, and orchards of mulberries, pomegranates and figs. It was a most striking change. 30. As the Commissions progressed, Colonel Wahab and his survey party followed the line of boundary, demarcating where necessary with rough cairns of loose stones, which are entered in the description of boundary marks as “ pillars,” but which were merely erected in order to mark geographically fixed points on the line. From the debouchment of the Knlagan river into tne Mashkel plain to Jalk is but a day’s march, and at Jalk again we found ourselves in a fertile oasis literally embedded in the gravelly clay hills that border the plain. Four or five square miles of dense palm-groves with about a dozen villages scattered through them, lying deep in beds of cultiva tion, and surrounded by orchards, constitute the district of Jalk. Through the midst of the oasis runs an abundant supply of water drawn by kare* from the western hills, which expands into grass swamps and canals as it flows eastward and northward, and finally loses itself in the Mashkel desert. Thirty or forty miles east of Jalk on the edge of the hamim (which was nothing but a dry expanse, covered with salt efflorescence last7 March)Talk water comes again to the surface, and is the support of those /lashkel date-groves which formed the mostimportantpointoiai*- cussion in the boundary demarcation. The origin of this extraordinary on flow running to waste through cultivation and desert, uninfluenced apparently by the local absence of rainfall which had failed for three years in succession, is difficult to explain. It apparently never fails. The Siahan springs which supply the Kalagan river and the karez of Isfandnk lie in bill* of similar configuration, and probably of the same geological formation as those oi Jalk. 31. From pillar No. 7 which may possibly secure some degree of perma nence from the fact that it is built upon the ruins of what to be • ancient sarai, the boundary was carried northward so as to separate tlie t* o principal groups of date-groves, and ended with a short but sharp turn wards to its junction with the Talab river bed. Here some f-rm of artificial demarcation became a necessity. Stones were not to be had, so a ^ e ,! of loose earth, sand, and brushwood were constructed by Colonel atab ana Captain Kemball, in the hope that as they gradually resist th e action ot driv ing sand in this wind-swept country, they may develop into well marked d or hills, something different to the surrounding sand wav^ 8 - A lai^e of the Jalk population was turned out by the Asad-ud-Doulah to assist in tin ir construction, so that their position is at least well understood, and mav possi bly be respected owing to the interest in their permanence of rival claimants to the groves. ir i. 32. From the Talab river junction northward to the Malik Sian Kon e nature of the boundary has already been described. It is happily one con structed by nature which cannot possibly be mistaken. 33. At the second meeting of the Commission at Jalk, on the 14tb, this Motion of the boundary pawing through and thence following watercourse and watershed to Malik Siah Koh was praoti oally decided. The Itisham showed uo wish whatever to dispute this MCtiun, and was quite prepared to accept, not only our surveys, but our 0 P' n, °'* “ to the advantages of the line adopted. No Persian official was sent to make enquiries, and i was never even suggested that the local Governor (Ike Amir of Kain) should be consulted in any way. This was cf course very Mtisfartorr to us and it only remained to decide the rights of ownership to the Msshket and the northern (or Muksotag) groups of date-groves respwtively. It was at this meeting that the Asad-ud-Doulah showed signs of a determination to rList being saddled with the responsibility of controlling the Dainam cultiva tors of the northern groves, although persisting in maintaining their P ers, ® n status and their rights as cultivators. His objections were, however, for the time overruled. • ui i 34 Between the initial pillar at Kohuk and the junction of the Mashkel boundary with the Talab river there are certain points of departure from the line indicated in the agreement made between Her Majesty s Munster a Tehran and the fchah’i Government, the reasons for which require explana- ^ 0I1 * 85. A copy of the map forwarded to illustrate the Tehran agreement is appended, together with a map on the same scale frtm the Indian surveyors, showing the fine finally adopted. It is difficult to make a valid companion between maps differing so largely in imnort^t details, bu ^ fr ^ the &gt;^ together perhaps some idea may be formed as to the chief points of departure from the Tehran line. 86 From pillar No. 2 (the position of which is absolutely fixed by the Tehran agreement) the line is carried in a north-westerly, rather than westerly, directiorrto the crest of the Siahan range, and is thence continued along the watershed of that range westward to the neighbourhood of the Bonsar pass instead of passing along the foot of its southern spurs. Ihe possible necessity foflbU deSn is contemplated in Sir M. Duraud’s letter of the 80lh December. 37. It was found that there exists a number of small date-groyee at the fool of these southern spun between Kobok and lafandak, the cultivation of which8 depends on water sources contained in the southern face of the Sishan moun tains. These groves form an inseparable part of the Kobuk-lsfandak district. It was therefore absolutely necessary to mahe this deviation in order to include the groves and their water-supply within Persian limits. 38. A smaller but still not unimportant conoession was made in retiring the line from the hill overlooking the Bonsar pass (to which point it is carried by the terms of the Tehran agreement) sufficiently far eastwards to prevent the command of the pass from falling into the hands of Baluchis whilst still occupying Kalat territory. As it was clearly the intention of the Tehran agreement that the Bonsar pass and the road connecting Isfandak and Kalagan should fall within Persian territory, I thought it best to ensure the security of the pass, although no special representation on this point was made by the Persian Commissioner. 39. The third and by far the most important concession was that which diverted the boundary northwards from the Tehran lines so as to separate the northern group of date-groves (including Gorani, ^luksotag, etc.) from the southern group which includes Ladgasht and Ealag, so asto bring the former under Persian jurisdiction. Here the Persian Commissioner made strong claims. He represented that the cultivators of these northern groves were Daman is, undoubted Persian subjects, dwelling near Ladis, and that it was impossible that the Shah could have understood the situation when he signed the Tehran agreement. He added, unofficially, that it would be necessary to appeal to his Government before permitting the groves to pass over to Ealat. 4'. The necessity for such a deviation is recognised in a Secret despatch (No. 184 of 1895) from the Government of India to Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, which recommends that this deviation should be adopted. It is also clearly contemplated in Sir M. Durand’s letter of 30th December, though not in his map. The Persian Commissioner's representations as to the nationality of the cultivators was found to be correct, and it seemed inex pedient to adopt a line which the Damanis would have the right to cross at their convenience, and which might thereby leave indefinite the question of responsibility for the conduct of these most notorious raiders in future. There was, moreover, a certain risk in the delay that would arise were references made to Tehran. As the Commission progressed Tehran influences appeared to grow weaker, and there was a strong disposition evinced by the local Governor (the Asad-ud-Doulah, Zain-ul-Abadin) to assume control of the Persian Commission. 41. 1 conceded this point therefore on the understanding that (1) a special clause should be introduced into the agreement, recognising the responsibility of the local Governor of Persian Baluchistan for keeping the Damanis in check; and (-) that the northern section of the boundary line from Mashkel to Malik Siah Eoh should be accepted on the terms originally laid down at the first meeting of the Commission with a certain modification which would secure to Ealat a tract of desert country between the Amalaf Eoh and the Talab river as a quid pro quo for the conoession of the northern groves. I might possibly have claimed with success a considerably larger slice of territory west of the Tehran line than this comparatively insignificant tract, including a part of the Mirjawa district between the river Mirjawa and the range east of it which bears the same name. But I did not press this point. Ealat has no possible claims in this direction, and it would have defeated the object of securing a strongly marked and almost impassable natural frontier, which will conduce more than anything else to the peace and security of this northern border land. I did not think it advisable to weaken a good natural line by claiming a quid pro quo which could be of no possible use to Ealat except for purposes of aggression. 42. Thus it appears that all material concessions have been made to Persia, and the agreement should be entirely satisfactory and acceptable at Tehran. 43. At the same time Ealat interests have not been disregarded. By the terms of the Tehran agreement Ealat has secured the Ladgasht date-groves (to which Naosbirawani claims were by no means indisputable) as well as the0 2X*i lands of and Tump on the right bank of the Mnekkol river, which on&lt;* Kohuk. Had there been, during the progress of demarcation, any nortion of territory that could have been, claimed with expediency for ha a toUie west of the Tehran line, it would have been claimed, but there waa none. 44 . It * very possible that Sir Nauroe Khan will express his dissatisfac tion that hit claims to Kohuk, Isfandsk and portions of Jalk and Kalagan, benidcH numerous other claims, have not been enquired into. Such ngnra, however, as the Naoshirawani Sardir did undoubtedly possess in years g° n ® '7 in these and other plaoes within Persia, could not in any way affect the deli mitation of the boundary between Persia and Kalat. It was probably on account of these rights that the Persian Governor of Kerman paid (or pro fessed to pay) yearly to Sir Nauroz a sum of mone/ which I bpheje h&gt; hav e amounted to Rs. 1,000 per annum. It is doubtful, however, if this amount was paid with any regularity, and it has entirely ceased. 46 . The Anal agreement, the maps, and the techmcal descripticn ofthe boundary drawn up by Colonel WahaVwere signed by the Itniam and ioyself on the 21th March at Jalk. As the Asad-ud-Doulah persisted in his objection to the clause which defined his responsibility as Governor of Bampur in con trolling the lawless clans of Damanis, who are the owners and cultivators ot the northern date groves, the Itisham signed the agreement without consulting his opinion further in the matter. The Asad-ud-IMilah will no_ doubt awept the position when he finds that no unreasonable demands will be made from him personally for compensation in lieu of possible damages “ c ' ITe ' * future Damani raids. Due consideration must of course be pud to the diffi culty of his position in dealing with these impracticable and Tagi £e™?“ subjects who are at present only nominally under his control. As the frontier becomes more settled he will doubtless be aMe to control them more effectually. 40. As regards the maps on which the boundary was colored information of the Persian Government, and copies f Commissioners have been submitted to the Gov^ment oflndta, it should be understood that it was at the special request of tbe ^ sheets were made use of rather than traces of the revise ^ sigvey s on thc ame scale. As the reasons for this request on the part of the Itisham appear tome to be sound, and applicable to all our map dealing with nrigbbmirmg States who have neither the power nor the will to make accurate ^surveys for them selves I will repeat them; and it should be noted that the Itisham ra, the only Persian subject who, from his k nowledg eof^rT^mg. wuM as an authority on such a subject. He represented that wsththo exception of himself there was not a single court official at l ehrac who wuld read map correctly, and that the value of a map would SaevitaUy be estimated by ite size and general appearance. Such refineroonts as would be introduced by the addition of extra^pographioal detail h«l were not of the least importance m the eyes of the Shah. On the oUier hum, whilst printed maps existed anything in the nature of a fr* 06 . only orSiem and wnfining all map detail to the immediate '“i^bouAood of the boundary would be retried with great suspioKm. Wo oarWv teeveditedwith wrme hidden motive for ^ aDProval when the printed maps whieh we were known to posww wefe held. The Itisham’s reasoning is well worth consideration and mu a is mutandis, I would suggest that it is as applicahle to Afghanistan as to 47. The proceedings of the joint Commissions were conducted from first to last in a spirit of mutual respect and good fellowship. With regard to the THsham-i-Cximh, my colleague as Persian Commissioner, I may perhaps be ne-mitted to say that he is an officer distinguished by most exceptional qualifications for the position. He thoroughly understood the value of maps, Ld he was actuated throughout by feeling of impartiality and fair play, which cannot be regarded as otherwise than exceptional amongst orientals Possible difficulties might have arisen had the Comnnssion been prolongtd, from the fact that he was dependent on the local Governor (the Asad-ud- ma ;for supplies and support, whilst to a certain extent he superseded and orer- ahadowed the Asad on hi* own ground. But this danger terminated with the conclusion of our work, and if that conclusion is satisfactory, it is largely due to the courteous disposition on the part of the Persian Commissioner to meet all my wishes half-way. 48. As regards the staff of the British Commission, I have the honour to call your attention to the excellent work performed by my assistants. Lieutenant-Colonel Wahab, R.E., will submit his own report. No oppor tunity was afforded for the extension of triangulation for geographical pur- S oses, and the work of the survey party was almost confined to a resurvey in etail of the actual route and boundary line. Some 3,000 miles of country were thus revised. Colonel Wahab’s long and distinguished services on the frontier are too well known to need further reference from me. On this occasion all that could possibly be done was done, and the successful efforts of the survey party, not only on the line just demarcated, but south of Kohuk, between that place and Gwadur, should leave no room for future discussion as to the position of the boundary. 49. Captain C. A. KembalTs local knowledge of the country and the people and the circumstances of rival claims has been of great value to me in laying down the boundary along the line originally indicated in his own reports. In no case has any great departure been made from his recommenda tions, the soundness of which have been abundantly proved during the progress cf demarcation* The entire management of the difficult departments of transport and supply has been in his hands and all his arrangements have been excellent. Captain P. M. Sykes, Her Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, brought with him all the special information that was requisite from the Persian side. His personal influence with the officers of the Persian staff and his colloquial know ledge were invaluable in bringing all discussions to a speedy issue. By his own energy and interprise, and chiefly at his own expense, Captain Sykes has secured a position of influence for the Consulate at Kerman which can hardly fail to have an important bearing on Baluch frontier politics, and which might at once be turned to excellent account in the settlement of outstanding frontier claims and disputes. When all present claims for damages on account of recent raids are settlwl, there seems a very fair prospect of long continued peace and security on this remote Baluch border. 50. The services of some of the native officials of the Commission have already been brought to the notice of Government specially, some having been recommended for departmental promotion and others for honorary distinction. In this report I have only to bring to your notice the services rendered by Sheikh Taj Mahomed who was head accountant of the Commission as well as a most valuable agent in collecting supplies and information throughout its pro gress. He is a good English, Persian, and Baluch scholar, possesses great influence in Southern Baluchistan and is a man of energy and resource. Should an extra native political assistant be required hereafter in those remote districts, I think that it will be difficult to find a better qualified man. An honorary distinction would be well bestowed on him. MOXPC —94—Vl-1—14-3-34—25.The HoUich Agreement, dated 24th March 1896. Demarcation of the Boundary between Persian Baluchistan and Kalat. Agreement In accordance with the agreement for the delimitation of the Perso-Kalat frontier from Kohnk to Koh-i-Malik Siah, drawn up between Her Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Teheran and His Highness the Sadar-i-Azam of Persia, dated tne 27th December 1895, this frontier has been demarcated as follows: Commencing from the Mashkel river it is defined by the bed of that river from pillar 1 to pillar 2. Pillar 1 is placed on a conspicuous hill on the left or north bank of the river, about a mile and a half below the junction of the Gazbastan stream with the Mashkel, and almost immediately south of Kohak Fort. Pillar 2 is built on a well marked hill on the right or south bank of the Mashkel river about 0 miles above the junction of the Mashkel and Hakshan rivers. From pillar 2 the boundary runs in a north-westerly direction to a conspicuous peak on the subsidiary range which runs from the Tank-i-Grawag to the Siahan. The peak is marked by pillar 3. From pillar 3 it follows the watershed of this subsidiary range to its junction with that of the Siahan Koh and thence it is defined westward by the main watershed of the Siahan range to a point about 4 miles east of the pass called Bonsar or Sharindor, on the main road connecting Isfandak with Jalk. At this point, which is marked by pillar 4, a subsidiary watershed or spur runs northward, along which the boundary extends, leaving all drainage into the cultivated tracts of Kalagan on the Persian side. The boundary is here marked by a conspicuous peak, distinguished by a natural bluff resembling a tower on its summit. From this peak 5, it is carried to pillar 6, which is placed on the main road leading a little south of east from the village of Kaladen towards the Mashkel river. Pillar 6 is 4 miles from the village of Kaladen. From pillar 6 the boundary runs direct to pillar 7 on the main road connecting Jalk with Ladgasht and Mashkel at 12 miles from Zirat-i-Pir-Omar at Jalk. From pillar 7 the boundary is carried in a northerly direction by a straight line to pillar 8. * Pillar 8 is placed on the road connecting the date groves of Ladgasht with those of Muksokhta or Muksotag, and it is erected at a distance of 3 miles from the southern edge of the Muksotag grove, so as to divide the southern S of date groves, including Ladgasht and Kalag, from the northern group, includes Muksotag, Gorani and others. Ladgasht, with its date groves, becomes the property of Kalat, and Gorani with its date groves, has been allotted to Persia, on the understanding that the frontier governors of the Persian Government in future become responsible for the conduct of the Damani cultivators of these groves. From pillar 8 the boundary runs 14 miles nearly north to pillar 9 at the south-eastern edge of the Kindi date grove, and thence in the same direction for 3i miles to the north-eastern edge of the same grove of Kindi, where pillar 10 is erected. From pillar 10 the boundary runs 11 miles a littie south of west, so as to clear the northern edge of the Kindi date grove, to pillar 11. Pillar 11 is on the edge of the right bank of the Talab watercourse, and about 1 mile east of the northern end of the Gorani date groves. From pillar 11 northwards the Talab river becomes the boundary to it* junction with the Mirjawa river. From the point of junction it is carried by a straight line to the nearest point on the watershed of the Mirjawa range, which limits the drainage into the Mirjawa river on the north.Thence it follows the main watershed northward to the highest point of the Eacha Koh. From the highest point of the Kaoha Koh the line is carried straight to the highest point of the Malik Siah Koh. Camp Jalk; ^ T. H. HOLDICH, Colonel, R.E. t 24tk March 1896. j H.

Z. r*' r z r V &gt; Memorandum from C. Alison, Esq., o.b., to the Persian Minister for Foreign A fairs,—dated Onlahek, the 1st September 1871. The undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, acting on the part of his Government, has the honor to submit, for the approval of His Majesty the Shah, a map in which the boundary line between the territories possessed in Beloochistan by Persia, and the territories forming the exclusive property of the independent State of Khelat, is delineated. , This line may be thus described : Commencing from the northernmost point, or that which is furthest from the sea, the territory of Khelat is bounded to the west by the large Persian District of Dizzuk, which is com posed of many Dehs or minor Districts, those on the frontier being Jalk and Kallegan. Below these two last-named is the small District of Kohuk, which, together with Punjgur, comprising Parum and other dependencies, is on the Khelat side of the frontier, while on the Persian side is Bampasht. Below Punjgur, the frontier possessions of Khelat to the sea are Boleida, including Zamiran and other dependencies, Mund and Dusht. Within the Persian line of frontier are the villages or tracts belonging to Sirbaz and Bahu Dustyari. The boundary of Dusht is marked by a long line drawn through the Drabol hill situated between the Rivers Bahu and Dusht, to the sea in the Bay of Gwuttur. To summarise : Punjgur and Parum and other dependencies with Kohuk; Boleida, including Zamiran and other dependencies ; Mund, including Tump, Natserabad, K»*d.i, and all Districts, dehs and dependencies to the eastwara ; Dusht with its dependencies as far as the sea: these names exhibit the line of actual possession of Khelat, that is to say, all tracts to the east of the frontier of actual Persian possession, which frontier comprises Dizzuk and Bampusht, Sirbaz and Peshin, Bahu and Dustyari. The undersigned proposes, with the concurrence of the Persian Govern ment, that, for purposes of future reference and identification, he shall obtain the services of an experienced English officer of engineers, who may meet an officer duly appointed by the Government of Persia and an officer from the Khelat State, so m to lay down the more prominent land-marks and features of the actual line agreeably to the above description, and make a careful survey thereof for record. This subordinate commission should meet as early as practicable in Gwuttur Bay and proceed upward* from the boundary terminus between the Rivers Bahu and Dusht, to Jalk or the neighbourhood, submitting the result of their work in the form of a map to the representative of Her Britannic Majesty's Government and the Persian Government at Teheran. The undersigned begs to offer his sincere congratulations to the Govern ment of the Shah on the happy termination of this troublesome question, and on the consequent removal of those serious causes of trouble and anxiety which disturbed the harmonious relations so desirable to cultivate between the authorities of Great Britain and Persia; and he has the honor to renew to His. Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs the assurance of his high ooMiderakioa. 1 Jemelmkon of e letter from Mulza Sabbd Kean, to C. Alison, Esq., c*.,—dated 18 th Jem. II., 1288 (corresponding with the 4th September 1871). Your Pxcelfency's letter of the 1st instant, together with the map of General Goldsxnid, the British Commissioner, xespecting the frontier line2 between the Persian possessions and dependencies in Beloochistan and the Beloochistan dependencies made over to the independent State of Khelat, have been received and have both been submitted to His Majesty the Shah. In obedience to His Majesty’s orders I beg, in reply, most respectfully to state that the Persian Government, notwithstanding the clear right which it considered itself to have over Beloochistan, simply out of regard for the wishes of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government that this question should be brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the definition of a boundary line, has hereby accepted Your Excellency’s letter and the map. The Persian Government now looks forward to the desirable results and important advantages which it expects from the British Government for this great act of compliance and oo-operation on the part of Persia, and awaits to see what will emanate froin the suitable manner in which the matter will be represented through the good offices of Your Excellency, an experienced minister and a well wisher, perfect ly cognizant of the whole details of the merits of the question.

In compliance with Your Excellency’s instruction, I delivered yesterday evening to the Minister for Foreign Affairs your note to his address, together with the maps and a translation of your instruction to me. I urged His Excellency to lose no time in sending you the documents required of him, as General Goldsmid was to leave for England to-morrow. The Minister said that the Shah intended honoring him with a visit to-day, when he hoped to obtain His Majesty’s sanction for sending you the necessary reply, and reciprocating Your Excellency’s congratulations. He, however, again made an allusion to the question of Kobuk, and I stronglv recommended him not to let it stand in the way of the reply now expected from him. Your Excellency, I said, had done all that was agreed upon at the conference of the 22nd August; had telegraphed in that sense to London and to India; and the Perso-Khelat frontier question was, thorefore, settled ; any attempt made now to disturb that arrangement would be a breach of faith, and lead to serious consequences. The Minister replied that he would do everything in his power to give satisfaction to Your Excellency, and that if he succeeds in doing so on the occasion of the Shah’s visit, he will regard it as an auspicious event in his life.3 Just before leaying, he asked me whether it would not he suitable that some mark of approbation (iltifat) should he conferred by the British Govern ment upon the Persian, and by the Persian Government upon the British, Com missioners. I said I could not answer that question, but would communicate the suggestion to Your Excellency, 5. Memorandum by Mr. W. J. Dickson, on Mirza Agsadullab’s interriew with Mr. C. Alison, c.b., —dated Oulahek, the 5th September 1871. Mirza Assadullah called upon Mr. Alison last night and delivered the copy of General Goldsmid’s map defining the Perso-Kbelat frontier, to which the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had. attached his seal. He was also bearer of two letters from His Excellency,—one accepting on the part of the Shah the line laid down in that map, and the other having reference to certain wishes expressed by His Majesty. Mirza Assadullah said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had deputed him to congratulate Mr. Alison upon the termination of this important and troublesome question. Mr. Alison was well aware what the Shah’s original wishes were, and it required no small amount of pains to persuade His Majesty to give up his rights. The Minister considered that His Majesty, in accepting the present frontier line, had shown a great act of friendship towards Her Majesty’s Government, of consideration towards their worthy representive, and of condescension towards himself (the Foreign Minister), whose arguments were instrumental in bringing about this happy result. But what afforded him the greatest gratification was the fact that the Shah’s assent was given at the Minister's own residence, while His Majesty honored him with a visit—an event which he hoped will be remembered at the British Legation, as it always will be with pride in his own department. The two letters were then read to Mr. Alison, who expressed his acknow ledgments for the trouble taken by the Minister in this matter. * MOiPC —M—VI*1—14-S44— it.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3425A</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3425A</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/28A ‘Persia: Perso-Baluchistan frontier; demarcation near Mirjawa [mostly copies of papers on 28/28]’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1924/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-01-11T16:44:19</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (285 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 286; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Photographic reproductions of letters, memoranda, printed copies of correspondence and maps, relating to the demarcation of the border between Persia [Iran] and British Baluchistan (in present-day Pakistan) around the town of Mirjawa [Mīrjāveh].
