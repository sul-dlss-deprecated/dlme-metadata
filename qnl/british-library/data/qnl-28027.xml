Bullard’s observations confirm our view that little weight can be attached to Soviet Government's version, and I think that the best course will be for you to reply to M, Molotov on the following lines;- 2, We are glad to note from his letter of 26th February that the attention of the Soviet Consul at Kermanshah has been drawn to the incident described in Mr. Baggallay’s letter. We are sure that M, Molotov will agree with us that it is most desirable that the Soviet and British representatives in Persia should always, in their relations towardseach other, conduct themselves in the spirit of the Anglo-Soviet alliance. We therefore shall not hesitate to bring to the knowledge of the Soviet Government any further complaints which may appear to us worthy of investigation in this connexion, and we trust that any possible cause of misunderstanding between our representa tives may thereby be eliminated. &lt;2. n-M - yLs oh XATS [Cypher] DEPARTIjIENTAL No. -' FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE.

Lt.Colonel Fletcher is confident that Kazi's account of the conversation is correct. Questions which Kazi attributes to Soviet . officials are.moreover, in complete accordance with soviet propaganda methods. 2. The Soviet Consul Kermanshah is undoubtedly an_ intriguer. Apart from his activity among the Kurds he is inclined, according to Fletcher to act as^ an agent provocateur’asking^ritish officers why they allow Persians to do this and that.

They brought greetings rom the Ruaaian Tonsul who invited all tribal leaders to look upon him as a brother and visit him then they came to Kermanshah. ‘sghaf Khan considered that for a Consul to want to put hi self on a footing of brotherhood with tribal leaders showed a great want of dignity. He apparently returned non-committal spiles to the invitations to be a Russian brother and visit the lonsulote;l Ihulata Hussain Khan, who is Bakholidar of Rawansir said that is people round asked him if they should entertain the Rus inns and ho asked me iny views, I said that the Russians wen a 1 lied to the ' claims t nd our- serves and should therefore be tr* ated as such and appropriately enter** tained.
