                           Euphratesbe released and that Edwards had written on the subject to the Captain of the
                           Euphratesand was satisfied with his reply.A further postscript, dated 13 July 1866, relates to the runaway slaves and informs Pelly that the Melik is still dissatisfied with the response. As Edwards does not feel he has the authority to go on board the vessel himself he has written another letter to Captain Atkinson, a draft of which is included in the postscript, and notes that this appears to be a question for a law officer and that he has not as yet received any communication from the Consul at Busreh on the matter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189687.0x000023#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
