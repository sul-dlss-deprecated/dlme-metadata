In view of the fact that Isfahan lies in the Russian sphere whereas Shiraz is situated in that part of the neutral sphere which the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed his readiness to regard as in the British sphere, Sir E. Grey con siders that a too close connexion between the two posts might prove most unfortunate.

The Zil es Sultan was informed in reply tnat all facilities would be afforded him for the journey and an advance would be made to him for the purpose. In regard to the loss of his jewels he was assured that the value of his property would be recovered for him in due course, either from the Persian or German Government, and he was asked to furnish a detailed statement as to the objects deposited by him at the Imperial Bank. Meanwhile His Imperial Highness requested by telegraph that a sum of Two hundred thousand francs might be remitted to him immediately as an advance on the compensation eventually to be obtained from the Persian Government for the loss of His Imperial Highness’s jewels. This sum was to be applied to the liquidation of certain personal obligations incurred during His Imperial Highness^ residence at Hice, and was apparently to be outside the Two hundred thousand i/O three hundred thousand francs requested for travelling expenses. In view ol the importance of not discouraging one Zil es Sultan at the outset and of the urgent necessity of expediting his departure for Persia, oir h. Grey has authorised His Majesty’s Consul at Hice to advance this sum to the Zil es Sultan and has directed that it be debited to the Consular Vote pending an eventual readjustment of accounts.

I am accordingly to request that you will move Their Lordships to consent to one half of this advance, viz. One hundred thousand franco falling as a charge upon the Imperial Exchequer, the other moiety having already been accepted by the Secretary of State for India as a charge on Indian revenues. The advance will presumably carry no interest and will eventually be recoverable either from Lis Imperial Highness himself or from the Persian Government. I am to add that Their Lordships will be approached, and their sanction invited, before any action is taken in respect of any further advance which may be required by the Zil in respect of compensation for losses incurred owing to the loot ing of the Imperial Bank at Isfahan; and I am to express the hope that in view of the important political issues involved Their Lordships will not withhold their sanction of the contemplated advance of Two hundred thousand francs in respect of theP Ms Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with 1 ^ nnless required for official use,] r~ 13 x •4 4 ^ m*ja 0 i ' ' — ; PILSS ..0 Decypher Lord Granville (Pgis) l4th _ igl6&gt; D. 8,15 P.rm April l4th . 1916 .

On the other hand to oppose his return would be to alienate his son and his friends who are at present rather powerful and I think that we must acquiesce.

Your Excellency I have just received the visit of Mohasserol-Molk the deputy of Mejlies, coming from Teheran, and send out specially ty my son Prince Akhar Sareme-Doieh (one of the Ministers in the actual Persian Cabinet), bringing me a list of all my things (jewels, silver, gold, decorations, etc.) that were deposed at the Imperial Bank of Persia at Ispahan, and taken lately by the Germans, valued more than £40.000. Jn spite of that since they have known that I am under the British and Russian protection again, and have ordered to my people at Ispahan not to take part with them, they take daily sums from my properties there, and by now impossible to send out any money for me here, every thing being in their hand. Being under the British and Russian protection I think of your duty to take responsible the Persian Government for all what I have suffered and will suffer from Germans at Ispahan, and to be have with me as in the case of the British subjects that are in the same cases. The two Legations are quite aware about all what has happened, and have promised their best support. At the same time my son urges me to return back at once to Teheran, as has done the Persian Government,Government, and the two Ministers, and from the other side I think my presence at Teheran will he much better in the present circumstances, for you and my self , and ask you to oblige me by advancing me a part of these sums due to me, through the Imperial Bank of Persia, on the account of the Persian Government, that I may be able to start for Teheran the sooner possible. I have written also on the same subject to His Excellency the Russian Ambassador, and hope to receive the sooner a favourable reply, and leave for London. At the same time I must renew my best feelings towards your Government, and to assure you that I will do all in my power for the sake of Great Britain that I have always admired and her Allies.

(June 24, 9T5 p.m.) (No. 213.) ISPAHAN situation. Your telegram No. 140 of 23rd June. There are certainly disquieting elements since arrival of Russian troops ; [? at all events] centre of German activities has been transferred from Tehran to Ispahan, and there are now at the latter place four or five German agents with perhaps thirty Austrian soldier prisoners escaped from Transcaspia via Meshed, and as many as 200 armed retainers recruited locally and from Nib Hussein’s brigands. It is possible German plan is to attack Russian and British consulate, &amp;c., in hope that Russia will send troops to Ispahan and that Persia will eventually get embroiled in the war. Persian Government have at present about 400 gendarmerie in Ispahan and more are to be sent from Pars, while new Governor-General, Sardar-i-Ashja, whom Russian Legation believe can be trusted, has a considerable force of Bakhtiari sowars. Government has sent orders that German retainers are to be disarmed, and if Swedish officers have their men in hand and are supported by the Governor-General there should be no danger. Rank and file, and particularly native officers of gendarmerie, however, are reported to be very pro-German, while attitude of Bakhtiaris generally was decidedly defiant at time of Russian demand for dismissal of Sardar Mohtashem, and so far as I can see [? Russia’s] hold on new Governor-General consists mainly in his personal relations with Evreinof, and it was mainly on that account that Russian Legation agreed to his appointment in succession to Mohtashem. Personally I deprecate withdrawal of consuls. It would be sign of weakness, and presumably with them colonies and telegraph staff would also have to leave. I think that Evreinof should be sent to Ispahan with a good supply of money with which to [group undecypherable] Governor-General’s friendship. Zil-es-Sultan’s appointment to Ears was suggested by Persian Government about five weeks ago, and at the time in their [group omitted : ? opinion] seemed unobjectionable, but proposal has not been revived.

After sorae enquiries as to whether X anticipated trou &lt; bles in Isfahan in connection with the Governoi: General and whether Mukhbir us Sultaneh was likely to be recalled fros Pars In the near futur* f Ku&amp;ayoun Mirsa # with the usual parade of mystery dear to the Persian Bind,proceeded to enquire whether l would be prepared to support his in a scheme to bring the %ill us Sultan back to Persia. Xhe Prince was at some pains to impress on me that he alone of all the sons of the Sill us Sultan residing here is in an independent position,owning certain landed property in his own right. He foresaw that in the future His Majesty*s Government would attach more importance to Isfahan than they had done of recent years. 2here were in his opinion two main obstacles Sir W. !Townley,M*G.M. G., etc etc etcobsta«l«s to his father* s return to Persia (3-) the Bafchtiaris (2) one or possibly two of his brothers. As regards the first of these obstacles he had sounded both the Ilkhani and Haji Ilfchani Khans and felt confident that their feelings towards H.R.H. were now of such a nature that # if the British Legation choose to interwene_a4^.id*.there should be no difficulty about effecting an understanding between the Eakhttaris and the 2111 us ?3ultan. Intersarriages (here the Prince reminded ae of the approaching sarriage of Ali Besa Khan,son of Sardar i Muhtasham,and the daughter of Sardar i Aaaap?, Banoo 0s»a , 3 son) , exchange of propert ies, possibly even raoney payments wight be wade to contribute to that purpose. At this point Kuaayoun Kir3a enquired whether Sardar i Kuhtashaia had not al - ready spoken to ree about some such arrangement (Please cause a reference to be wade to my despatch No.7 of the 16th ultimo) . If any hope were held out to him that the British Legation might be prepared to give its favoura ble consideration to such a project he would be ready at any tine to go to Tehran to discuss it. I replied that I had no qualification to treat such a matter with him and was not in a positionto give hire any idea as to how such a proposal might be viewed by you. a would however report my conversation with him in due course. I may add that Kuaayoun Miraa is credited with being the most grasping of the sons of the Zill us Sultan residing in Isfahan. I should esteem it a favour if you would cause instructions to be sent to me for my guidance in the pro bable event of Humayoun Hiraa again approaching me on the subject above reported. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient, humble servant, Sd/ G .OKAHAKKR 2716. India Office, 22nd July 1912. Sir, With reference to your letter No. 26,801 of the 25th June I am ^directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram dated I2th July 1912, that has been received from the Government of India regarding the retention of the Indian cavalry regiment at Shiraz. That regiment was sent to Shiraz for no other purpose than the protection of the life and property of British subjects which were believed to be in danger, and now that the danger has ceased to exist it would naturally be withdrawn but for the complications arising out of the attack on it while escorting Mr. Smart in December last. It appears from Sir W. Townley’s Despatch No. 123 of 18th June, and his telegrams Nos. 397 and 403 of 2nd and 7th July, that there is no ground to expect that our demands for reparation will be met within any reasonable time. In these circumstances Lord Crewe, having regard to the situation as a whole, would propose for Sir E. Grey’s consideration that our demands should not be pressed now in a manner that would increase in any way the difficulty of withdrawing the regiment in October, and is inclined to think that, in spite of the embarrassment that will be created at Shiraz, the regiment should then be withdrawn provided that there is then no real danger to life and property. But though His Lordship would no longer insist on the surrender and punishment of the culprits as the necessary condition of withdrawal, it is obviously desirable that the Persian Government should be encouraged to take measures such as those indicated in Sir W. Townley’s telegram, No. 415, of the 18th instant, and from this point of view His Lordship is inclined to regret that Sir E. Grey does not see his way to press for the appointment of the Zil- es-Sultan as Governor-General of Ears, as suggested by Sir W. Townley in his telegram No. 402 of 7th July. It is true that he has an unenviable reputation for cruelty, but so long as the Persian Government are successful in purging the province, Lord Crewe does not think it possi ble to apply British standards to the methods employed by their officials. According to the information contained in Sir W. Townley’s Despatch, No. 116, of 17th June, and its enclosures, the state of insecurity on the Shiraz-Bushire road is worse, and the rates of blackmail levied are higher, than ever before. Lord Crewe would suggest that the necessity of arriving at an understanding with the tribes regarding the levy of blackmail should continually be pressed upon the attention of the Persian Government as a condition of the effective working of the gendarmerie. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, (Signed) B. Ritchie.[TMs Dooament is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's GoTer''&gt;»»»* ] 3anb 1 PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL.

Tehran, August 17, 1912, 9‘30 p.m. PRINCE SULTAN MAHMUD, son of Zil-es-Sultan, is leaving immediately for Europe. His object is to impress on his father that, from what he has heard, return of ex-Shah is almost certain, and to advise him to come to an understanding with ex-Shah. He based his opinion on what is generally said in Tehran and also on views of Russian Minister, with whom one of his brothers is in almost daily intercourse. Zil-es-Sultan’s family are very anxious that he should go to Shiraz as Governor- General, but I should strongly deprecate such an arrangement if he went there as a sort of British counterpoise to Mahomet Ah in the north. Princes say that ex-Shah is about to send an emissary to London—possibly Saad-ed- Dowleh—to represent that British interests would be carefully protected and spirit of Anglo-Russian convention maintained were he to be allowed to return.CONFIDENTIAL.

The only way in which revenues of the Zil-es-Sultan family’s possessions could he improved would be by the appointment of an impartial Governor-General to Ispahan. An opportunity of securing this may occur soon, as the present Baklitiari holder must go. Both my Russian colleague and I are agreed that we ought to oppose the appointment of a Bakhtiari if one is suggested for the post.w CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.
