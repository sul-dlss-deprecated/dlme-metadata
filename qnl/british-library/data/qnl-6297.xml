Regarding the cash, as he had been aid only ' a few days before, he would certainly have that amount in his ^ossessioi I also think his claim for Rs,36/- for damage to the boxes and locks very reasonable, and personally I very much doubt if he will be able to have the boxes made as good as they were before for that amount.

On Wednesday evening my Engineer, tTamil, saw a dallal in the suq with a revolver in his hand which at once struch him as being so like tre one stolen from Ibrahim that his suspicion was aroused and he took it from the dallal. On Thursday morning he telegraphed to lorahim asking him to telegraph * the number of his missing revolver, and he refilled the same day ti^t it was No. 252161, which is the number on the revolver in ’question. I have carefully ascertained from the telegraph office that Jamil sent no other telegram to Ibrahim except the one in which he asked him to wire the number of the revolver, and that neither he nor anyone else sent him any telegram from which he could possibly know what the number on the revolver was. I think', therefore, that Y.S. v/ili agree tuat uliere can be little jioubt tnao the revolver is the one which was stolen from Ibrahim, though I have no doubt that your man Aoaullah bought it in all good faith. To make absolutely certain, however, I have telegraphed to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Basrah, under whom Ibrahim is now serving, asking him to ask him several further particulars about it and also to Mr D*Hello, who was in charge of the Agency at the ti le oi the theft asking him what he remembers of it, and will write « * I g I ' Rp p again when I receive their replies. Jamil has, of course, handed over the revolver to me, and, if you agree, I will keep it till then. It was i\/rong of Jamil to take the revolver from the dallal without first obtaining your permission to do so through me and I regret that he should have done so*&gt; ' -■ 4 Major J«C * More, D.S.O. f Political Agent, K o w e i t. Sir, With reference to your telegram No«t69 dated 14th March 1921, to the address of the political Agent, Muscat, I presume? that the xsx: revolver referred to therein is the one of the former Koweit Agency Vernacular clerk, Ibrahim, which was stolen from his box some time in June or Julyl919, when he was on casual leave at Basrah* He had left the keys of his house with the Agency boatman, Ali Dashti, who was killed last year in the fighting at Jaharah. Ibrahim had, it appeared, told Ali that certain of his friends (including some peons in the Customs) could be allowed to come in his ftouse in his absence* The theft was* not reported to me at once but a few days later and after Ibrahim £ad returned from Basrah* With the revolver a photo of a woman (wife of Tobacconist Mm Dimitri) was also stated to .have been taken* Ibrahim at first suspected Ali Dashti and then Khan * Sahib Abdul lAtif and the latter*8 peon whose name is Jassim I think* He reuqested me to delay taking action as he was confident that he would be able to trace the revolver. About 15 days or a month later he told me that he could not trace it* I told him then * to go ani report the theft to the Shaikh who, he told me, remarked * . • # that it should have been reported to him at once, but that, at any- r rate, he would make enquiries and try and arrest the thief and reeove the revolver but practically nothing was done by His Excellency in the matter. The case was explained to Captain Mc’Collum when he returned * from leave and ss resumed charge of the office.

I have delayed writing any further on the subject until now, as I have be eh awaiting a reply from Mr. D'Mello, which has now arrived. I received a reply from the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Basrah, at the time in which he gave me Ibrahim’s answers to the questions which I had asked regarding the make and size of the revolver, and, as these are correct, I consider it to be proved beyond any shadow^ doubt that the revolver in question really is the one which was stolen from Ibrahim in Ramadhan 1337, as reported to the late Shaikh Salim in Mr. Duello*s letter No.628, dated the 3rd July t^l^ wnich is equivalent to the 4th Shauwal 1337. V j f ^ I had been unable to trace any reply to this letter, but Mr. D Hello tells me that the late Shaikh Salim did not reply in writing but promised verbally to have inquiries made and to try hnd arrest the thief and recover the revolver.

Shaikh Ahmad al-J&amp;bir as-Subah, Ruler of j£uwkit # A. C. I regret to have to bring to Y.E’s notice a case of assault on the permanent employe' of a British firm by two of Y.E’s watchmen. It*appears that last night at about a o’clock the bearer, Kirsa fthulam ’’All head clerk of kessra Uie Mesopotamia Persia Corporation was. walking in tlie bafah and heard someone call out but did not realize that it was he who was being addressed; the watchman who had called then called out again and he saw that it was him they were calling and at once stopped. The watchmen of wheat there were two asked him why he had not stopped when told to, and he explained that he had not known they were speaking to him. They then told him t* go home at once, and he asked them why he should have to as other people were about and shops fit ill open. The two men thereupon beat him and tore his shirt. As far as I can see Mirza Ghulam ’All was doing nothing wrong, but that is a minor point, and what I am complaining to X.E. of is the fact that the permanent employe of a British firm should he beaten by watchmen who have no authority to do so. Had he been doing anything wrong. It was obviously the watchmen’s duty to report tk&amp; matter to their superiors, and not te take the law into their own. hands. As I am sure that Y.E. will never tolerate the maltreatment of the employes of British firms, I shall be grateful if X.E* will personally inquire into the matter and punish the delinquents in a suitable manner.
