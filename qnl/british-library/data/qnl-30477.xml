Political Agent, Muscat, informed me as regards retaliatory passport measures that he considered Sultan would have no ohjaction but as number of Persians in Muscat was insignificant, practical affect would be small. Political Agent, Kuwait, reported that question was being considered by Shaikh, who asked time t give definite answer, but v/ho for some reason did not appear to regard proposal with favour. No difficulty should be experienced in obtaining letters from Trucial nhaikhs as desired but as diplomatic measures are not understood by them ( vide para. 13 of enclosure No. 3 in No. 1 Admiralty to Foreign Office, of November 12, in Persia Confidential Series Nov. 15, Section 1 ), I am inclined to doubt whether request for such letters is advisable especially in view of effec already produced of Bahrain measures.

My dear Minister, I am instructed to inform you that my Government has ’received a communication from the Sultan of Muscat in which His Highness requests the British Government to make representations in his favour concerning the passport regulations recently issued by the Persian Government which appear to aim at treating Muscat nationals as Persian subjects. Your Highness perhaps knows that in October last the local customs authorities, having seized a passport belonging to a Muscat merchant, thereupon claimed payment for a Persian passport. It appears that the Central Administration * of the Persian Customs have given strict orders to the local authorities to demand always a Persian 'tazkerah' from Muscat subjects and to regard these nationals as Persian subjects. It appears that these regulations also apply to the nationals of the whole Arabian coast. It is true that Y our Highness was so good as to , promise me on the 7th January, on the occasion of our first conversation on the Gulf questions, to enquire into the subject of the passport regulations to which I drew your attention, but my Government nevertheless desires me to ma^ e serious representations to the Persian Government in accordance with the Sultan’s wishes. The attitude adopted by the Persian Government* Government in this respect appears inadmissible to the British Government, not only as concerns the Sultan of Muscat but the other chiefs of the Arabian Coast also. I trust then that Your Highness will be so good as to assure me that the above-mentioned regulations have been withdrawn. Please accept, my dear Minister, the expression of my very high regard.
