Political A Ho. C/204 Kuwait, 15th March, 1942 From Major T. Hickinbotham, O.B.S*, Political Agent, Kuwait. To The Hon’hle the Political Hesident in the Persian aulf, at Bahrain Sir I have the honour to refer to our conversation in Bahrain on the 7th of March and to enclose a copy of a note which I have recorded on my two visits fro a Shaikh Chassib, the eldest son of Shaikh Khazal, lately Shaikh^Mohommerah. 2. The interviews were most cordial and Shaikh Chassid was at pains to be polite and insistent on his pro-British sympathies hut hearing in mind his father*s history I found them painful. I have made no reply to his reguests other than to say that I would pass them on to you for such action as you considered possible and desirable. I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Maj or, Political Agent, Kuwait.Tisit of Shaikh Ohassil) tin Khazal to Kuwait, Maroh, 1942* Shaikh Chassih arrived here on the 3rd of f arch and called to see me on the morning of the 4th of March. He informed me that the Iranian Government had hy means of a notification published three and a half months ago in Iranian newspapers called for claims to property sequestered by the late Shah. These claims were to be lodged within six months of the date of publication of the notification, and Shaikh Chassib and eight other heirs, there are I believe twenty nine heirs in all consisting of fourteen sons thirteen daughters and two nephews of Shaikh Khazal, had telegraphed claims to the Iranian Government prior to the issue of the notification whereupon Shaikh Chassib was instructed by that Government to lodge his claim to the Finance Minister and I am informed that this has been done. I understand also that some of Shaikh Chassib sisters who were in Tehran when the ex-Shah abdicated lodged a claim immediately. Shaikh Chassib is more than doubtful of his family’s claim succeeding unless His Majesty’s Government will press the Iranian Government to make what restitution is practicably possibl e to the descendants of a man who was not treated by them and others with that consideration to which he was undoubtedly entitled. He stated that he had approached His Majesty’s Ambassador in Baghdad, His Majesty’s Consul^and various members of the C.I.C.T, but from each he had received a non-committal reply. He had asked permission to enter Iran personally to press his claims in Tehran but he had received no reply from the British Embassy in Baghdad. He approached the Iranian Consul in Basra and asKed for a visa but was informed that he could not enter Iran unless he first surren dered his Iraq passport and applied for an Iranian one. Shaikh Chassib drew my attention to the reputation which he stated/- 2 - stated in his opinion Great Britain rightly enjoyed for fair dealing and mentioned Sir Percy Cox*s letter dated the 21st November, 1914, and went on to remind me that Shaikh Khazal had died in Tehran probably from poisoning and that the family property both in Iranian and in Iraq, was no longer under the control of Shaikh Khazal’s heirs* He then concluded by stating that Sir Percy Oox’s letter was issued under instructions from the Government of India and he therefore appealed to them on his own behalf and that of his faraily to aid them* I said I would pass on his repuest to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. On my return to Kuwait from Bahrain on the 10th of March I was surprised to find Shaikh Chassib still here and apparently awaiting my arrival. On the 11th of March His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait called to see me and in the course of conversation mentioned that Shaikh Chassib had asked his permission to go to Riyadh to ask Ibn Saud to take up his case with the British Government and that he, the Shaikh of Kuwait, had replied that naturally he could not object to his going to Riyadh but that he must first obtain Ibn Baud’s permission. Shaikh Chassib applied through Abdulla al Nafisi, the Saudi Government agent here, for permission to pay the visit but after some delay Abdulla al Nafisi was instructed to enquire for what purpose Shaikh Chassib wished to visit Riyadh and he accordingly did so. It seems that Shaikh Chassib then again consulted the Shaikh of Kuwait and stated that he particularly wished to see Ibn Saud as he had a document signed by the Shaikhs and leaders of Khuzistan calling on him to assume his father's title and return to Khuzistan as their Shaikh and Ruler and he wished to enlist Ibn Baud's assistance to induce His Majesty's Government to permit him to do so. The Shaikh of Kuwait strongly advised him to give up all idea of going to Riyadh in person and suggested that if he thought that it would be of any use he could always make a written appeal/appeal for help to Ihn Saud. The Shaikh of Kuwait told me that he understood that Shaikh Ghassih would not press his request jejs for permission to enter Saudi territory hut would return to Basra and added that he had given him a gift of Rs. 1,000 to help him in his extreme poverty, 3, On the 12th of March Shaikh Ghassih again called on me and said that he was returning to Basra as soon as he could arrange a car and that provided I had no objection he was pro posing to send his wife and children here for a holiday. I replied that provided His Highness the Shaikh agreed I could not possibly object. He then went on to describe how the leaders of Ehuzistan had appealed to him, how they had offered their services to the British and their only request had been that they should not be delivered over to the Iranian Govern ment again, and how no one had given any reply to him or his father’s people. He then talked to me for a time about his financial position and I was surprised at the smallness of their income and strongly advised him to sell the three houses they have here to the Shaikh, of Kuwait, who is I believe willing to buy them. He said that the Shaikh was only likely to pay Rs. 15,000 for the two near the Agency which was little more than a tenth of what they cost to build. I pointed out that it would cost at least Ks. 20,000 to repair them properly and he could not do better than sell them while there was a purchaser. He said he quite agreed and would do his best to persuade the other heirs to agree to dispose of the property in the meantime he offered them to the British Government rent free should they at any time wish to use them for war purposes.Ho.C/205 Political Agency t Kuwait* 15th March, 1942* My dear Colonel, Please refer to my letter No.Q/204 f dated the 14th March, 1942» 2* Sven if it is not possible to make any ■v \ i \ territorial amends to the Khazal family it mi^it be politic to give them some sort of financial aid for much as Shaikh Chassib may be distrusted by the people of Khusistan I should think that he could, should he be so induced by our enemies, make considerable trouble for us in those parts in the event of the Germans striking at Turkey and Iraq* I am not suggesting that he would but it should be remembered that he and his family can have little cause to regird us with kindly feelings and they are bankrupt human beings. Yours sincerely, The ~ ' TVh Confidential D.O.No.C/337. Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain. Dated the 3th April,1942. 'col r jy, Jifrl ‘ ViU Please refer to your letter No.C/204 of the 15th ~7 March 1942. 2. I forward herewith a copy of the marginally ) noted 1.

Letter No.30 (5/7/190, dated the 9th October ) pondence. 1941, from the British Consulate, Basra, with ) enclosures. ) 1 3. You will see from this correspondence that Shaikh Chassib was warned to abandon his intrigues in Khuzistan and that he promised to break off immediately all relations with the Arab leaders in Khuzistan and take care in future to consult the British authorities before taking any action. In spite of this it is clear from paragraph 2 of the enclos ure to your letter that Shaikh Chassib is still intriguing and that he actually proposed to make a personal appeal to Ibn Saud to assist him to obtain his father 1 s position as ruler of Khuzistan. In the circumstances much as I sympathise with him I find it impossible to ask His Majesty*s Minister at Tehran to intervene with the Persian Government on his behalf. Indeed it seems probable that if Shaikh Chassib were permitted to return to Khuzistan and resume possession of his father*s property he would seize the opportunity to do everything in his power to oust the Persian authorities. As, however. Shaikh Chassib has appealed to the Government of India I am forwarding a copy of your note to that Govern ment in case they may take a different view of the matter. / 4 .

(355/8/41) British Embassy, Baghdad. 18th September ,1941 Dear Prior ? I enclose herein a copy of a despatch which I have sent to Weld-Forester at Basra. Strictly speaking the question of Chassib’s intrigues to get back to Mohammerah are, Tthimk more the concern of the Residency at Bushire than of British Headquarters in Iraq or the Enbassy Baghdad, but it seemed so clear that Chassib f s activities were in every way un desirable that I thought it better to send him a warning at once and to avoid the delay which v/ould result from follow ing too closely the correct channels. Yours sincerely, sd.Adrian Holman. Lieut.-Col.C.G.Prior,CIE. Ho.42. (355/7/41 }7 13th September,1941. Sir, I enclose herein a copy of a memorandum from the Officer Commanding the 8th Indian Division Basra to Force Headquarters in Bagdad concerning Shaikh Chassib, which has been transmitted to me with the endorsement of the General Officer Commanding. 2. You will see that Major-General Harvey suggests that it is desirable that pressure should be brought to bear on^ Shaikh Chassib to make him desist from his present intrigues. I entirely agree with this suggestion and I should be glad, provided you see no objection, if you would send^for Shaikh Chassib and warn him that if his present activities continue he will inevitably incur the displeasure of His Majesty’s Government. You should add that neither he nor any other members of the family now domiciled in Iraq should make any attempt to return to Persia without first obtaining the concurrence of the British authorities concerned. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Fprejgn Affairs, His Maj sty’s Minister at Tehran, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the General Officer Commanding British Forces in Iraq and Iran. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) Adrian Holman. His Majesty’s Consul, Basra. Copy. From - Headquarters, 8th Indian Division IIo.P/S.K/02. To - Headquarters, Force Iraq, Bagdad. Date - 7th September, 1941. Memorandum. Shaikh Chassib,eldest son of the late Shaikh of Mohammerah. /SinceSince the entry of British troops into Persia,ireports have been received that Shaikh Chassib is endeavouring to stir up the tribes in the south with a view to restoring the past position of the family. 2« Briefly f Chassib caused pamphlets to be distributed which purported to demand the assistance of the Arabs of Khuzistan for the British against their Persian masters. Since then he is reported to be sending agents from Basra to Persia and to be instigating the local shaikhs. His plan is that they should combine in requesting the re installing of the family in Persia. According to His Majesty Vice Consul at Khorramshahr, he (theConsul) is receiving a great number of petitions from shaikhs on these lines* 3* It is,of course, natural that the family should hope for re-instalment, and it should be noted that three sons ? Shaikh f Abd al Karim. Shaikh Abd al Majid and Shaikh Abdullah have dissociated themselves from this intrigue ^ but have written P.A.offering their service in any capacity, 4* His Majesty®s Government have made an acceptable settlement of their obligations to the late Shaikh ana the last thing we require now in Khuzistan is a renewal ot the matter. It is realised that Shaikh Chassib is without funds and is a man of no prestige, nevertheless i^ ls suggested that His Majesty’s Ambassador be approached with a view to pressure being brought to bear on Shaikh Chassib to desist from intriguing which can only result in trouble fo~ himself and for those persons who associate themselves with him. Vhe entry of himself or any of his family into Persia should be definitely forbidden. (Signed) A.C.Galloway, for Major-General Commanding 8th Indian Division.

Shaikh Chassib did not deny that he had distributed pamphlets or that he had corresponded with certain shaikhs. He maintained however that his sole object had been to encourage the Arabs in their support of the British and that he himself was too old to try to regain his father f s position or return^ to Khuzistan® He' said that he would like to see the Arabs of Khuzistan freed from Iranian oppression but that he had expressly told the shaikhs not to ask fo^ the reinstatement # of his family. In support of his statements^he produced copies of his pamphlets and of the letter he had written to the Shaikhs, which I enclose in translation and original. 3. It was pointed out to Shaikh Chassib that hov/ever dis interested and pro-British he might consider his^activities, the^ in fact constituted an interference m Iranian politics^ which could not be tolerated, and that unless he abandoned his intrigues in Khuzistan he would incur the displeasure Ox His Majesty f s Government® He assured me that his only ^desire been to serve the British cause and that he would im lediatrly break off all relations with the Arab leaders in Khuzistan and take care in future to consult the British authorities he ore taking any action. He promised moreover that he would^make no attempt to enter Iran without the permission of ^the Bntisn authorities ? and his brothers have all made similar* promise^. 4.

Your Excellency, We beg to submit to you our grievances as under := We the Arabs of Khuzistan are the residents of this country for generations, and as the sons of our forefathers we beg to’ lay before you our case with the hope thatyou will give it your due consideration with the kindness and justice which are your characteristics. Your Excellency, we are the descendants of Arabs who were residing in this territory, which fact is well-known to you.^ We therefore submit our grievances to you on finding and seeing that the British Forces have entered these parts to safeguard the rights of Arabs as a whole of which we are a part and parcel.' Your Excellency, our interets are the same as yours at the present juncture, and as we are from among the Arabs who have'been given a definite promise for the safeguard of their rights, we join them and approach you for the purpose. We complain to you because we had independence and freedom and we never naid any taxes, nor did we yield to the Iranian Govern ment. We yielded only to our own Heads of Tribes and took orders from them and th^y v/ere, Haj Jaber, Shaikh Maza'l and lastly his brother Shaikh Khaza ? l Khan. During this short period,i.e.from 1925 when Shaikh Khaza ! l was taken to Tehran, to August 1941 we have suffered oppression, tyranny, and persecution at the hands of the tyrant Pahlavi Government which killed our tribal Hedds and fathers, photographed our women folk, shed the blood of our' children and violated our religion. We beg of your esteemed justice to be kind to us and have us freed from the Iranian and Pahlavi oppressions, which are void of kindness and pity in their hearts. We take take this opportunity to submit to the British Government and to the British nation our deep thanks and regards at this happy occasion on theentry of your Forces into our country* Their entry has saved us from oppression and subjugation at the hands of Pahlavi Government and their associates the Nazis. v our Excellency, we hereby assure you of our sincerity and Place at your disposal our lives and property to win the war and to further your cause. Your Excellency, we tnerefore beg of you kindly to intervene on our behalf and assist us by requesting the British Government to have us released from this oppression, and to treat us like our Arab brothers m the Persian Gulf,i.e. Bahrain, Kuwait, etc. and take us under vour protection and appoint on us a head whom you consider best end who is sincere to you.

February, 1946 from Political AyentTxzuwait. As your time was limited, I had to curtail my talK with your Excellency during my last visit to you. I am therefore going to . • disturb you by means of this (letter) and to say that I do not see that I have done anything that has any contact with the interests of your respected Government but, on the contrary, I always was and still am loyal, faithful, and ready to offer myself in the interest of His Majesty’s Government. It surprises me if you consider that my return to Arabistan, my birthplace and home, was undesirable, bearing in mind that I did not return there for an illegal purpose, but had made my intention clear to the Iranian authorities in a letter, a copy of which I had sent to the British authorities in Arabistan. But the Iranian authorities refused to deviate from their usual dictatorial plan and surprised me with a direct attack of their army, with the intention of falling upon me, I then hod to return to ’Iraq, being afraid that some trouble might occur which would probably not be in agreement with His Majesty’s Government’s policy. But I am sorry to say that when I returned to ’Iraq I found out that the ’Iraqi Government was chasing me and had taken measures to arrest me and insult me. When I saw the situation was like that, I was obliged to take refuge in Kuwait, depending on your assistance and believing that it is my other (second) homeland, after Mohammarah, due to good relations existing between our family and the family of our late uncle, Shaikh Mubarak. I am now prepared to obey your orders and follow your instruct ions, in case you insist on my departure from this town and will leave everything to God. But there is one point which hampers my departure from Kuwait, i.e. my financial position which is in dis order. I have no income which would enable me to live in a distant (remote) country unless you assist me to obtain my due share of my father’s property in Iran, (as I have no income left in ’Iraq, with which I can live, and this is known by the officials of your great Government there whom I have already informed about it. That is what obliged me to leave ’Iraq for my birthplace where I could live among my uncles). Or you may allow me to proceed to Saudi Arabia to live there under the shadow of the Great Arab King of that country, with whom we have relations of friendship and mutual oblig ations. I therefore request you kindly to consider my case and critical position and treat it with kindness and justice. In conclusion I shall expect your reply and a fruitful result with patience and I request you to accept my highest respects. LE3.7 ! i. SECRET. No. C/66. The TOli'Cic'hX Agency, Kuwait. Dated the 3rd February, 1946. The Hon’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE . Subject :- Shaikh Abdullah Khaz f al Sir, I have the honour to enclose a translation of a letter received from Sha5-kh Abdullah Khas’al requesting instructions as to his future actions. / 2. He has verbally stated (a) That he will carry on no political activity while in Kuwait. (b) That if granted an amnesty and permission to live on his property in Iran he will assist the Persian Government in every way provided it does not come under Communist control. He points out that, when tribes such as the Qashgai who were persistently anti-British during the war have succeeded in regaining their 'rights', it is an anomaly that the family or ShaiKh Khaz f al who have always been our friends should not have regained theirs. (c) That he has now no property left in f Iraq and that he is prepared to die fighting for his rights rather than^to continue his present existence. He appears to be under the impression that with 500 rifles and the support of the divines of Nejef he could establish the independence of Khuziztan and maintain it against the Persian Government and army, provided there was no hostile interference from British forces. (d) That if his return to Khuziztan is forbidden^by us and he is required to reside elsewhere than in Kuwait or in Saudi Arabia he must either have a stipend from the Income of his family estates or be reduced to beggary. 3. The bacfcjound to his excapade appears to have been as follows* He visited Nejef and consulted the 3hia T religious leaders, m particular Shaikh Abdul Karim Zanjani, and found them concerned over the future of their faith in Iran in view of Communist influences and the new Kisrowi religion. I surmise that they refused to proclaim jehad but suggested to him that, if ne could take up residence in Khuziztan and form a focus for local feel ing they were prepared to accord him their backing at the appro priate time. This accords with an approach previously made to this Agency by a Shia* divine here on the lines^that,the Arabs of Khuziztan would welcome independence of Persia and affiliation with India under British protection. x' /' I have the honour to be,Translation of a letter, unnumbered and undated, from Abdulla Khazal to 11.E. The Governor-General of Khuzistan. I beg to state that as I have been away from my beloved country for so many years, and in spite of repeated requests was not permitted to return, and not being able to bear this exile any longer, 1 was obliged to return to my country and reside in my late father's palace, to look after my personal affairs and those of my family and the tribes of this Province (to which my uncles and paternal uncles are connected). I give your honour an assurance that I am ready at risk of life to serve the country expecially at this time of crisis, and I hope that you will view my return with good faith, and not believe any rumours or lies spread by self-interested persons, and that the visits and return calls between myself and my uncles will not be the cause of suspicion. In the meantime, I request that in order to prevent any misunderstanding between myself and junior officials, they may be informed of my intentions. Sgd. Abdullah khazali .

I came back to my country and 1 am not in enmity with the Persian Government, as explained in my letter submitted to you this morning, but unfortunately their araed forces deceived us at 12 o*clock this noon, opened fire on us without any warning and, in consequence of this injustice, one of us v/as shot dead vdthout any cause and in spite of the fact that we respected the gendarmerie post which was in my father’s palace and did not harm them I thin^ that the same guards, who were released by us, will admit this.

Last sentence of Baghdad telegram No. 71 January 19th read: ,f when Abdullah comes back here as he is almost bound to do he will be sent to live far from Basrah as a punishment for having broken his bond” is there any chance of Abdullah being persuaded to return to ’Iraq. Only other alternative (apart from staying in Kuwait) seems to be India but His Majesty’s Government are as I have said anxious to avoid claim for maintenance. 2.

I do promise that I will not ferment any political movement against the respected Oovt. and the interests of your -rreat j-ovt. , but-3? assugre you, ( as I had assured the governement authorities on return to my homeland,) ttot that I will co-operate with the government and will do my utmost to work faithfully with those authorities, according to the wishes of your Great Govt., and to be at the dispo sal of your Gvt. 1 s Officers. Hejjat ul Islam wal Muslemin, the Great Reformer, the Token of God, the Shaikh Abdulfeerim. az Zanjani, is my guarantor with regard to my future actions and sayings. I therefore request,(before my present dilemma becomes irre mediable) that you will take an interest in my case and sav€ me from, this parlous situation. I wish to add that I have already submitted a letter to the Prime Minister of the Iranian Govt, and explained to him how I was ill-treated by the officer-in-c&amp;Lrge of the garrison, when I returned to my homeland, and asked His Excellency to help me and be kind to me. I a3.so wrote a letter to Mr. Trott, H»M s Consul-General, Ahwaz, and another letter to the Manager of the A.I.O.C., Abadan in this.connection.

Abdullah Khazal to P.A.. Kuwait. \ 3. I consider we can place little reliance on the latter’s promise to the Ruler to refrain from any political activity while in Kuwait. During my interview with Shaikh Abdullah Khazal on the 9th March, he frequently emphasised his precarious financial position, and anim adverted at some length on the loss of prestige he would incur if he were compelled to become a taxi driver or adopt a similar profession to earn his living. 3. I am not in a position to assess his wordly wealth but, now that Iraq is closed to him, imagine he must be pretty impecunious and, from what I have heard it appears that he is in fact so. I do not think he will be content to sit in Kuwait for any length of time living on the crumbs from his step-mother’s table. I feel, then, that he is bound to wish to move on elsewhere or to repeat in some form or other his previous escapade and think we should be prepared for either eventuality. 4. His request to be allowed to return to Khuzistan is presumably not acceptable and, if His Majesty’s Government would in anyway incur any responsibility were he to cause further trouble while staying in Kuwait, would it not be preferable that he were persuaded to reside further away from Persia and that, as a last resort, we should be prepared to maintain him. I know His Majesty’s Government are anxious to avoid any^claim for maintenance and the only country where he might find asylum^ without our incuring any such obligation seems to be Saudi Arabia and suggest that the Ruler persuades him to move on there.

'.mbassaaor, ‘ Through H. ,, , Government’s Hepresentative, Kuwait. I have the honour to draw Your excellency’s attention to the unpleasant incident caused by Officers oi the Persian Army. Please be assured that inembers of the Khazal family and particularly myself consider themselves attached (protected) to (by) the British Government. wVe never have and never will take any action contrary tp the interests of H.B.iv. Government. ,e have shown ourselves to be devoted friends to the Government during our continuous good relations. The best proof is the forebearance we have shown in face of the oppressions and the false promises made by the Persian Government. All our fellow-men have received justice but this family, who are entitled to receive justice more than anybody else, still do not know what to do and are in a most unfortunate position. Your Excellency must know that if it were not due to the British Government's political expediency I would not bear so much oppression but would shed my blood to the last drop in oruer that the usurped rights of this family might be secured ana that Arabia might be purged of the wickedness and oppression of these covetous, despotic officials of the Persian Government am of the dangerous propagation (against religion and nationality). I wish the British authorities concerned would notify their non-interference in such cases in order that I might physically prove my sayings. In order to prove my sincerity and loyalty to the British Government I think it is simply sufficient to point out that when I returned to my country I prevented the Officers of the Persian Army (whom I eventually forced to withdraw) from causing a riot (which would have been against the interests of the British Government) otherwise the opportunity for revenge was at hand when the tribes had sworn to make a .general stand and draw attention of the Arab world to the oppressed state of the Arabs living in Khuzistan and thus save the Arabs of that province and. the family of Khazal from the tempestuous sea of oppression. In any case, owing to the above facts I let the opportunity slip by and returned to Iraq. In Basra I unfortunately noticed that the Iraq flattering officials were persecuting me. I therefore went to Kuwait where I now live. On my arrival I reported the details of the case to the representative of the British Government in Kuwait and am now ^xoGCtin to receive your fatherly instructions in this connection Compliments.

His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ahwaz, corroborates Major Stewart's account of the Soviet Consul's activity during the incident in a letter to the General Officer ^ommander, HAlC, ol which the following is an extract:- 'On the 11th January they all called to see me and asked me what all the bother about Shaikh Abdullah meant. i explained in general terms who S*A. was and what he was trying to get out of the Persians, and read out to them the letter which he had written to the Governor General saying he was a loyal subject, etc. They thanxed me and went off. The Governor General tells me they all called on him that afternoon saying that it was very urgent indeed, said that they had heard that Khorramshahr had falien and Ahwaz was in danger (though i had told them just the contrary; and asking for information. His Hxceliency of course calmed them down. Hut they went to Khorram shahr two or three times to see for themselves, and the O.C. troops teUs me that they sent off 3,000 group telefc;rams at that time to Tehran, in cypher of course.' Copies of this despatch are going to His Majesty's Representatives in Moscow and Baghdad, the Government of India, the British Middle Kast Office in Cairo, and His Majesty's Consular officers in Ahwaz and Khorramshahr. 1 have, etc., (Bgd) R.W.BULLARD. The Right Honourable Ernest Bevin M.P., etc. etc. * l assume however (judging by the recent reports about Bakhtian which have appeared in the Soviet Press; that tile Soviet Consul's interest in Abdullah’s incursion was prompted by the hope of being able to attribute it to British instigation or connivance and thereby to justify after the event Soviet action in northern Persia.Telegram 3D, 26/185.

GEOFFREY PRiOR Political Hesi dm t, Persian GulfTranslation of letter dated 11.4.46 from Aboulla al Khazaal Kuwait,* to 11.3.1.1's Consul-General in the Persian Gulf Through H.ll's Political Agent, Kuwait. After offering great respects, In continuation of many communications with the authorities of your Great Government, and having not received any satisfactory reply or any fruitful result, I Vvas obliged to submit this letter to Your Excellency, ex plaining clearly and briefly what I have to say. Your Excellency. I and my family have been suffe ring for many ye'rs, various injustices and oppressions, the humiliating and wrongful effects of which we have borne patiently; and we frrve been driven away and pursued; and v.e have lost many chance of recovering what v.as forcibly taken away from us. In addition to all this, we were prepared to shake hands with the Iranian authorities and co-operate v.ith them, according to the wishes of your Great Government to whom we arc bound with promises and covenants, while all our enuale, either loyal or disloyal to you, have seized that opportunity-without giving a damn for any one and regained by sword what was forcibly taken from them and they have become semi-independant in their territories where their influence runs, having self government, in spite 0 f the existence of the governmentauthority in those territories. But we, w r ho consider ourselves more deser ving, from pH points of view, whether elemental or other wise, are still living in hopes and imaginations, tasting the bitterness of material and mental humilation. As we are not in a position to remind or to censure, but ve are in a position of declaring the facts, thus I am bothering you with this letter saying:- Things have reached a climax and the noose is being%} - cL - tightened round me and my patience is failing especially now that our country and religion are ' on the brink of a precipice, and I do not know when it will collapse ' ; this is due to the activity of destructive propaganda, which has begun to leak into my country and my birth place, Arabistan, from the interior of 1 ran and even from Iraa, and which is supported by the government officials and the public 5 1 mean those who are connected with the propaganda and are loyal to it. I, therefore request now, i.e. before the opportunity is missed and before such propaganda spreads in my country on a larger scale and more actively, not to prevent me from returning to my •aforementioned native country, so that I may live among my relations, with whom I am bound by n alliance and oath ' and be able to work with them and co-operate with the government officials (the faithful ones of course); I mean those who have the same spirit as me and my followers, i.e. to sacrifice everything for our country ana our religion by opposing every destructive torrehttand resisting any tyrant or traitor. Indeed I have decided to oppose any person who cones between us and our sacrifice. I have also decided that when I return to my country, to stir up the great leaders of our religion, as I believe it is our religious duty to call them to action, and with whom I am personally bound. I shall consider whoever may act against this oraer, whether he is a government official or otherwise, to be the agent for that propaganda, and they are of the type of the 5 th column, whose purpose of acting against me or preventing me from returning to my native country is ' to ooison the relations ' between the simple tribes of Arab istan, whom circumstances have for many years oppostd, ( as it is well known to you ) and who have become3 disunited and incapable and having no leader who could manage their affairs 9 as have the neighbouring tribes. But on the contrary, there are amongst them some elements of dissension and evil, whose sole purpose is to mislead. and deceive, endeavouring to delude them for their per sonal benefits. I, therefore, am sure if they remain as they are, and if I don’t correct them, their nationality and their religious rights will be destroyed, and an irremediable calamity will occur, - ” it will t en be no use crying over spilt milk. ' I, when submitting this letter, have full confi dence that Your Great Government is very much interested in the protection ol the safety of nations anc religions, r therefore request you not to fail me ana give me an early reply, which I hope will include a. statement of no objection' to my returning to my country. I wish to ado that I will always be ready to receive your advice and bound to protect your interests.

My dear Mr. Jackson, Shaikh Abdullah Khazal is desirous of returning four of his Iraqi retainers, Mansur Kinaen, Mustapha !Tansur, Taryak Isa and shillaga Pjaloob, to Basra but before doing so would naturally like to know whether or not they are likely to be arrested for having assisted him in his recent excursion to Khorramshahr. I think it desirable that Abdullah should disembarrass himself of his retinue and should be grateful if you would make enquiries privately from Colonel sargon and let me know whether or not they will be molested if they return to Iraq.

I regret delay in replying but I have been trying to discover Iraq's reactions to Abdullah's return to Iraq. I now learn unofficially that Abdullah is at liberty to return but will have to stand trial for raid into Persia. Evidence is probably insufficient to convict him and on acquittal he would almost certainly be placed in residence forcee outside Basra Liwa. It is unlikely that he would be given a subsistence allowance by the Iraq government unless so placed in forced residence. \ 2. You will no doubt by now have seen despatch No. 485-S of April 21st from Political Resident Persian Gulf to India Office. I am inclined to agree with view expressed in paragraph 6 that if we cannot persuade the Iraqis or Persians to support Abdullah and his brothers we must do so ourselves. (In that case we could at least decide where they are to live - Cyprus seems an obvious place). I doubt whether Iraq would keep Abdullah in forced residence for ever. I also doubt a satisfactory outcome to negotiations for compensation between f V . Chasib and Persian government. Only alternative appears to be a British pension. ^ will telegraph again when I can confirm first paragraph above. NCJ - RETMANDUM -1 26/185. TELEGRAM CYPHER (O.T.P.).

I have always confirmed that I am loyal to my democratic government and uphold your interests and those*of your great government and that 1 am against any act which would be detrimental to my governments interests. I therefore send this letter through the bearer, Alsayed Abdul Kazak ^ 1 salman Alalafi, explaining my readiness to do anything in my power in the interests of His Britannic Majesty 1 s Government and yours. Indeed, I have already pledged myself to this and my return to my homeland and birth place was for nothing but this. And if I had any aims other than to establish my rights, such as to cause trouble or bloodshed, I would have taken advantage of opportunities which I have had previously, but I disdained these. But for what happened on my last return to my birth place the responsibility entirely lies on the shoulders of the Officer Commanding the Iranian Garrison who created all the trouble without any reason and from lack of understanding. My with drawal was not at all due to cowardice and fear on my part but, on the contxrary, due to my shrewdness and solely to avoid bloodshed and to safeguard your interests and His Majesty’s. To confirm, the opinion of me held by the public including the religious people headed by their leader, the Great Aalem, the great reformer shaikh Abdul Karim Alhanhahy, is that I am a prudent and discreet person and it is nbt my habit to lower my prestige or to do anything destrimenjtal to yours and your Government's interests and, if you investigate Into my statement I am confident that it will be found truthful.

Whilst he is sure that they will meet with leniency, he is even more sure that no advance guarantee of this could be secured.

Unless we put Abdullah in prison at Kuwait to which the Shaikh would almost certainly not agree, I am doubtful If we can indefinitely prevent his departure for Persia.

I agree that Abdullah Khazal can only be con sidered harmless if as far away as Aden*Kuwait and even Iraq a^e too near Persia for another escapade to be impossible. 2 , But I feel deportation is not justifiable. Best course would be to ,, persuade ,f him to go to Aden by offer of reasonable pension. Since however this would no doubt be dependent on outcome of Chassib ! s negotiations with Persian Government perhaps first step is to discover how far these have progressed.

What allowance do you think it will be necessary to offer Abdullah in order to 'persuade” him to go to Aden or elsewhere? How many dependents will he want to take with him? 3.

Political Agent, Kuwait Palace Hotel, KARACHI. • RHL.Office of fee Political Agent, Kuwait, Camp wuetta&gt; t ( Dated the 14 th August, 1946 . Sub i ect: - AbdullahKhazal Ibr dear Colonel, */ v * Please refer to your demi-official letter No. C /581 dated the 2 nd August, 1946 . 2 . I am afraid I dont know how many dependents Abdullah Khazal has and shall have tc make enquiries on this point after my return to Kuwait. The amount of allowance to be recommended should bear a imm* relation to Hie nunber of his dependents and it is difficult to »ooo»» rnmi. a figure without knowing this. I have not liked to discuss the subject with anyone in Kuwait for fear of starting rumours, but my own idea is that if he has no dependents he should be offered about E 500 /- per month. Ee will presumably take a wife and possibly children and servants and, if so, should be offered moire in pro portion. I do not see much prospect of persuading him to agree to anything less. 3 . I am certain that Shaikh Ahmed would never consent to hjfcing; Abdullah Khazal removed forcibly. Hie latter has invoked thoTArab law of ' and has taken refuse with Shaikh Ahmed who in there fore bound to protect him - with nis life if necessary. Should he allow him to be deported forcibly he would never recover his prestige throughout the Arab peninsular. The ca.se o 1 f f Ibn Saud and Fhshid ’Ali is an exact parallel. I feel it would be a mistake to asK him to do this. 4 . I regret that, ushen I left Kuwait, the indications were that Shaikh Ahmed has not helped Abdullah Kaazal financially as he told me he would, and that the latter is running into debt. 5 . Abdullah Khazal has nimself pointed out that rebellions cannot be started by beggars - at least not in Persia. Effectively to raise the Arab tribes ox Khuzistan ne would need some hundreds of thousands of Tomans apart from arms and ammunition. He is therefore not really dangerous at present although, if driven desperate by poverty, ne mimt make a 'suicide* attack' on Khuzistan as the best way out of his difficulties.

CHASIB SHAIKH KHAZA 1 L CQIIDEIMS THE PRESENT MOVEME^ IN KHU2IZTAN / We have published, somewhere else in this issue, a telegram from Moscow regarding a telegram from Shaikh Shasib Khaza’l rn connection with the prevailing situation in Khuzistan. Following is the text of the telegram as it was published in the 'Iran” paper dated the 24th August, 1946. It was published both in Arabic and Persian;- Cairo C/0 His Excellency Azzam Pasha, Secretary General to the Arab League. His Excellency, the Leader of the House of Representatives, m His Excellency, the Leader of the Senate. The Press; Al-Ahram; Al-Misry; Ad-Dastur; Al-Mukattam. It is heard from general broadcasting that the people of Khuzistan have submitted to your Excellencies certain applications. I must point out that none of the leaders of Khuzistan would betray their country and that those two persons who communicated with you were traitors to my father Shaikh Khaza’l as well as traitors to their country and their sole purpose is treachery. Their claim to represent all the tribes or Khuzistan has no ground and is contrary to actual facts. The applications they possess or those despatched, are forgeries and invented. The Khuzistan people have been Iranians for centuries; they are preudxof their nationality and of their Iranian-Islamic Govern ment. They also enjoy all rights and zeal (?) No aggression took place , leastways at present when His Excellency yavam as- Sultana is at the head of the Iranian Government. He is kind to all Iranians and treats them as a father would his children, especially the petbple of Khuzistan. I therefore request your respected Maglis to return them (applicants) to their exalted G-overnment of* Iran. I also request you to make a point of seeing that no hypocricy and sedition should happen among the neighbouring Islamic powers without any reason. You and I are bound by thw words of the testament: ’There is no God but God and Mohammed is his prophet*. LESS .Agency O.T.P. Political Agent, Kuwait.

LB. c;.OA F/n^NTlAl. - HAY -■SECRET Bheilchdom of 1, The province known as AiiABISTiiN (or KxiUZISTiil,') is a part of the Mesopotamian plain inhabited by arable speaking tribesmen and is separated from Iran by an arbitrary frontier demarcated shortly before- the last war* Important tribes such as the MEhiAISHT and the B.ANI laU live astride this frontier, which nevertheless marks the a\ zoximate boundary between the dominions of the Cult an and the 3hah as they exist ed for three centuries before the recent re-emergence of the i.rabs as a political force* KHU2iISTiiII is vital to iX&gt;6je m Persian economy cont aining as it does the oil pipe line and South Persia’s only tolerable seaports of MOHAUIERAH (iCHOERitPEAHR) and BMTDM SIlhHPUK. The main tribal groupings in the area are the CHA’B centred on P AT.T.aTTT YA the MUHAISIN centred on IIOHiLtlERAH (iTORRhliSilAHR) and on ABADhN Island-, the BMI TJUmi around IWOZA, the BMI TURUP around JuUFMIYA (SUSANGIRD) and the BANI LAM to the northward of the last up to the foot of the ZAGROS* The tribes to the East of these are of lesser importance* 2. The GKA*© moved into the area from what is now Iraq (and where detached CHA’B sections still live) in the course of the 17th century and rapidly became notorious as pirates in the Gulf in which capacity they periodically attracted the attention of the British Navy. During the period of their power the control of the Shah over the area was weak and ineffective. 3* Early in the 19th century however the ilUHAISIN who had been driven out by the CHA’B returned and rose rapidly into prominence* In 1812 the town of MOHAMtlERAH was founded by the CHA’B and its governorship given to Hajji YUSUF ibn hiAKDAW, the leading Shaikh of the JIUHAISIN: and the latter was succeeded in this diginity by his son, the great Shaikh Ha^ji JABIR who ruled from 1G19 to 1881. In 1857 he was made independ ent of the CHA’B by the EHTESHAM ud DOWIEH, Governor of the province on behalf of NASIR ud DIN Shah, and when later the CHA’B Shaikh was sent a prisoner to TEHRAN the PALLikHIYA area was added to his dominions# In i860 a new governor, the ZIA ul UULK, turned the tables and Ha Ul ji JABIR spent two years enforced residence in TEHRAN: but the next governor Prince PARSHAD ItlRZA reinstated him and he was givo-n the title of I-TUSRAT ul HULK. His remaining years vl. re passed in extending his x .ov/wrs over the neighbouring CHtt’B, and as a reinsurance against the fickle fortune ever liable to overtake Persian notables he at the same time acquired by purchase vast estates in Turkish territory along che SHATT ai ’ARAB. It is worth noting that he caiae under particular suspicion in TEIiRiJT for help given to the British in the suppre . sion of piracy on the KARUN. 4-* Hajji JABIR's eldest son and best general ’ISA predeceased him and he was therefore succeeded on his death in 1881 by his eldest surviving heir MIZ’AL. The latter, by encouraging dissensions between rival CHA’B pretenders, secured his own recognition as paramount Sheikh of both MOHAISIN and CEA’B, and by reducing to obedience the hereditary VALI of HAWIZA brought the whole countxy between the TIGRIS and the KARUN under his own control. This position was recognised by the Persian Government and he was given the title of HU'IZZ us SALTANEH. In 1897 he was assassinated by a conspiracy of his relations and was succeeded by his last surviving brother KHAZ’AL who was himself implicated in the plot* Shaikh Sir KKAZ*AL i bn Hajii JABIR Khan^ GCIE*, KGL'I* ( 1861 - 1936). 5* KHAZ’AL, who was aged 3^ at his a.ccession, was permitted by the Shah to retain his brother’s title of MU’IZZ us SALTANEH and' further honoured vd.th the title of 8 AEDAR AQPAS and appointed Persian Governor of Southern ASABISTAN* In 1898 he procured the final dovmfall of the CHA’B power and inherited all their possessions from the KARUN to HINDIYAN in the S.E. of the province. Finally in 1903 an imperial Firman (extracts at Appendix ’A’) confirmed his ownership of the whole of s. ARABISTAN/-2 SECRET S* .ARABISTAN with the exception of the Persian owned JARRAKI estates. His influence ultimately extended as far north as DISFLfL and his relat ions with the Governcr General of ARABISTAN whose seat was in f .at town were often strained, 6, The British established friendly relations with the Shaikh in the early years of the century in the same way as with MUBARAK ibn SABAK of KUV/'AIT who was at that time trying to free himself from Ottoman domi nation, This friendship became: of importance when in 1909 the Anglo- Persian Oil Company was founded with the blessing of the British Govern ment, Land for the pipe line and for the ABADAN refinery was acquired from the Shaikh who was perfectly well aware of the danger of what he was doing. He pointed out that as the oil interest grew in importance it would provide an irresistible temptation to the Persian Gov' -nment to re establish their direct authority in the area, and such a course of events would be fatal to him and detestable for his Arab subjects. He therefore agreed only on cond ion that he received guarantees of British support against Persian encroachment and this support Sir Percy COX, then Politi cal Resident at BUSH IRE, was authorised by the Government of India to provide, and was incorporated in a letter (not accessible to this office) dated October 1910, 7, In October 191A after the outbreak of hostilities between Turkey and the Allies had been formally declared. Col. KNOX, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, wrote a letter to the Shaikh (appendix *B*) calling upon him to concert with the Shaikh of KUwAH? end ’AID ul ’AXIS ibn SA’UD in an attack on BASRA in conjunction with ourselves. In return for Ms support he was in his turn promised 'all necessary assistance for the settlement of any problem which may in future arise between yourself and the Persian Government on account of any aggression or encroachment by the said Govern ment on your Government or your recognised rights or your property or lands situated in Persia, This premise will hold good notwithstanding any change of Government in Persia and regardless of whether the Government of Persia shall be autocratic or constitutional in form', T'n promise apprise equally to the Shaikh's heirs, and was dependent upon the following of British advice as to the course-to be pursued in any given circumstances, and as to the appointment of a successor. On 21 November 1914 this was followed by a further letter from Sir Percy COX, again British Resident in the Gulf (Appendix ’ C') making the same promises in regard to service already rendered and adding the further promise that the Shaikh’s date gardens on the Turkish bank of the SHATT al ’ARAB should remain in his and hia heir’s possession free of all taxes. In the same year Shaikh KHAZ’AL was invested with th 3 K.C.S.I. On 18th November 1914 the Marquess of Crewe (Secretary of State for India) speaking in the House of Lords referred to him as 'our Ally the Shaikh of HOHAMMERAH, Y/ho i as we know under Persian suzeram.ty but who is on special terms of intimacy with the British Government'. 8 , In 1915 the Turks proclaimed the Jihad, and most of Shaikh KHAZ’AL^ subject tribes siesed the opportunity to throw off his yoke in the name of the Caliph, The MUHAISIN however stood by their chief, and in addition to lending us 1,000 (not very dependable) troops in February, he sent his forces against the BAWIYA who had cut the pipeline, and in June against the FALLAHIXA CHA’B* His friendship was thus of great assistance to us in protecting our rear during the early stages of the Mesopotamian campaign and in 1916 he was rev/a rded v/ith the G.C.I.E. At the conclusion of hostilities he was even considered as a possible candi date for the throne of Iraq. 9* Shaikh KHAZ ! AL v/as an oppressive ruler, feared and hated by most of those over whom M neid sway, as is sufficiently shown by Me disloyalty of his tribes when the Turks proclaimed the Jihad. The BaHI TURUF and the BANI LAM in particular Y/ere never reconciled to his control, and his success in collecting taxes together with his practice c .... undermining/-3 SECRET .... simultaneously/- undermining the power of subject Shaikhs ensured him many enemies, lie maintained too the ancient Persian ^raoticc of blinding inport^rit persons whom he considered treacherous to him. His relations with the BAKHT1AEI Khans, his northern neighbours, though regulated by^a treaty of friendship, were soured by ancient hatreds. Nevertheless his great wealth and the shadow of British support were sufficient to ensure him immense power. •jO, At this point it is necessary to note that in the early days of the War the Government of India envisaged that BASRa would bo retained as a part of the British Empire. There could be no reason for returning it to the Turks and an independent Iraq was srill undreamed^or. Our relations with Persia were governed by the Anglo-Russian ^gr-eemen^ of 1^07 and in this framework our engagements to ohe Sheika ox were as reasonable as those which still govern our relations vata cne Shaikh of Kuwait. However the establishment of cho mandate m Iraq, a^a the sacrifice of Lori CUPEON’s idiglo-Persian treaty to American and French pressure at the time of the Peace conference left oar agreement wiich^ Shaikh KMiiZ’/iL completely in the air. But the oJd relaoions.ap subsisted, and the Military Handbook of 1924 states bluntly ^hot the Enai^n has always been consistently friendly towards the British and now^in his ola age depends on British advice to a far greater extern: -chan before. That veiy year was to see our uncoordinated policies ere te for us a situation of the most painful, embarrassment* 11. The tot to sang constitutional government of SULTii, idfuD Shah was in 1921 in the hands of Seyyid ZIA ud DIN TABATAB/il (the same v/ho was recently taken nto rt pimtect:: vo custody' on the orders of QA.VM es SULTi'iNEH) and this politician opened up negotiations with the Cossack Brigade of the Persian Army, at that time recuperating behind British lines from defeat at the hands of the Bolsheviks. As a result of these negotiations the Brigade under its General REZA Khan marched on TEHRAN, and a new government was installed with REZA as Minister ox War. Seyyi ZIA soon withdrew, and in 1923 the Shah followed him apprehensively to Europe on what was to prove his final exile. In Octooer of the same year REZA took over the office of prime Minister and addressed himself with renewed energy to the reduction of insubordinate provincial powers. The Persian army at that time, thought not outstanding, was a voluntary force with a leavening of foroign trained troops from the Cossack Brigade and the South Persia Rifles, and he achieved considerable success. The Shaikhdom of MOH/dMERAH with its profits for guarding the oil installat ions and its pretensions to British support was particularly tempting to the nationalist leader and its turn was not long in coming. The incidents which follow aro in a sense the crux of this summary and are therefore given in some detail. 12. In the summer of 1922 a detachment of Persian troops moving from ISPAHAN to AHvTAZ was attacked, defeated ana driven wi on heavy Toss of equipment back on to its base by a party of KITIGALU tribesmen. The Soviet Embassy (then for a variety of reasons unfriendly to Great Britain and basking in the sun of self righteousness after the nusso- ^ Persian treaty of 1921) gave the lead in a campaign of propaganda to she effect that this incident had been engineered by the British to prevent the Persian Government from xnroute-ing with existing arrangements bet ween ourselves and the- Shaikh of MORAL ER Ji and the jjiiKHTT r.T Khans. The Russians contin - to direct propaganda against Brioi uterference in Persian affairs and did all in their power to prevent Khan trom discussing the sit 11 ' -ion in ARABIST AN with us ac all, while encouraging the TEHRAN press in every possible attack on us. It was against this background that the svenue cAxmu tc se were oixi-olded-. 13, REZA IGian moved with extreme deliberation. In February 1923 he* transferred ARABISTAN from the ISFAHAN to the HAMAD AN divisional area, thus enabling movements of troops to be made into the province without....... to be/* ~ 4 - SECRET Simultaneously disturning the BAKHTXART• In Septeiriber he sent a small force to SHUSHTAP.;, puhlicly' announcing at the same time that he intended to work on good terms with the Shaikh, and concentrating attention on questions of oil guards and revenue. In November a settlement regarding revenue was reached and the Nar llinistor placed an order in England a or four Rolls Royce cars as a present for the Shaikh; with the result that in February 1924 Dr, MILLSPAUG-H (then American Financial Adviser) was able to state that if he could collect the money due from the Shaikh of HOHAMtffiRAH there would be a balance in the Persian treasury During the spring REEA Khan was involved in political intrigues in TEiid-N but in July the genuinenes of the Firmans by which Shaikh KHAE’AL held his lands were questioned. Thus was of course a direct threat on one of the points covered by the agreements of 1914* The wording of the enquiry was subsequently toned down but Shaikh KKAZ 'AL, furious adopted an intransi- geant attitude and rallied his supporters; and was warned in September that we considered his behaviour endangered British interests. REZA Khan made counter preparations and in October the Shaikh wrote to the High Commissioner of Iraq offering, in order to cease being an embarrassment to the British Government to throw in his hand and withdraw to Iraq, if suitable provision could be made for his • .upkeep* The purpose of this gesture and its sincerity are not known, for it was not taken up, and while 8,000 Arab troops were massed at Z AID UN the Persian Government put in order the landing ground at BEHEBIIAIT? On October 15th REZA Khan assured H.M. Minister at TEHRAN that ho would not advance beyond the encircling positions of KHOI RAMA3AD, GIIAHAR LIAHAL, BEHBEHAN and BANDAR DIEM, but a fortnight later he advanced on ZAIDUN which was evacuated by the Arabs under orders, though their rear gua.ro nevertheless suffered casualties* REZA then gave out that he would not advance boyor ZAIDUN unti _ th^ method of negotiation had been eniausted. H.M. Minister who was en route from England therefore called upon the Shaikh at MOH/sMI/IERAH, as a result of which the Shaikh sent REZA Klian a telegram of submission and apology. It was greeted first with ominous silence, and then by a demand that the Shaikh come and surrender to KEZA unconditiona.ily ■ .t 'SHIRAZ. The agree ment, when KHAZ*AL sent his telegram, was that the two should confer at BUSHIRE and that t he Persian troops should withdraw to ISFAHAN and BEHBEKAN so that the episode illustrates the reliance to be placed on the Ear Minister’s word. Nevertheless renewed British interposition elicited the explanation that REZA was indignant at the delay in receiving the tele gram, and this having leen explained as due to a technical ’ nkdown, it was agreed that on receipt of a new and more submissive cosi .unication • REZA with a retinue r f 10 or 12 would be the Shaikh's guest ax; ‘fAALIYA where he would pay h: a the respect due to his rank. KHAZ’AL did as was required,began to disband his troops and prepared to welcome his dangerous guest. On 1st December REZA Khan reached HINDIXAN* ErLAZ'AL, nervous, failed to advance beyond AHWAZ to meet him and his fears were to that extent justified that the following day 1,000 fresh Persian troops entered DIZFULo KHAZ ‘AL withdrew to MOHAMilERAH and REZA advanced to AHWAZ, where at the urgent insistence of K.K* Minister that this was the final chance, KHAZ UAL at last went to meet him. 14* On 7th December the two opponents swore eternal friendship on the Quran. It was agreed that a temporary governor should be ap^oi'.ted to ARABISTAN after which KKAZ ! AL should be reinstated, that Persian troops would be withdrawn from SHUBHTAR in the spring; that the Shaikh's authority over thn :\rab tribes would not be questioned and that , minor questions regarding revenues, taxation etc should be settled by agreement at a later date# The G-.0.0. Pars was accordingly appointed Governor, and KEZA returned to TEHRAN with one of KHAZ’AL’s sms whom, it - 7s -oid, he was to appoint as his A.D.C. 15* On the 19th of April 1925 Shai.kli KHAZ'AL and his son 'IJBDUL HAMID were arrested by the Military Authorities in the Shaikh's palace at FAILIYA and cammed off to TEHRAN® The Shaikh's offence was reported19/- 5 SECRET to ibe that he had failed to obey a summons to come to TEIilAN to discuss the final settlement -with ESZA Khan. The Shaikh remained in enforced residence in TEHRAN until his death in May 193^* There were rumours that his demise was accelerated, but he was ill and it is more probable that he died a natural death. Early in this long captivity he was prevailed upon to renounce all his rights in ARABISTAN, and Shaikhly rights over much of his territory were allowed to lapse. Only the Ir u i estates acquired with such wise prescience by old Hajji JADIR his father provided him with the money on which he lived after his fall. 16 . The attitude of H.M.G. appears to be that his failure to abide by our advice released us from all obligations. Jc may be questioned whether either of the contracting parties envisaged in 1910 that he would ever be advised to place himself unresisting at the mercy of an unscru pulous and faithless adventurer who was on the point of usurping the throne, and the contention of his heirs is that it is inequitable that the fruit of twenty years consistent friendship should be lost by the old Shaikh^ hesitation on a single occasion to follow such astonishing advice The position is concisely expressed in the minutes of a discussion on our present policy between Gen* WAVELL, Lt.Gen. QUINAM, Majo.Gen. SL2H, H.M. Minister to the Imperial Persian Government and the British Military Attache in TEHRAN. 17. ’Me do not wish to repeat the tragic history of those tribal leaders such as the Shaikh of MOHAmiEilAH to whom we gave promises which did not save them from the Central Government. It is not alleged that we did not keep the letter' cf the promises; it is certain u-at the holders of the promises believed that we wo eld be able to do for them things which in fact we could not or at least did not do” ! ^ARABISTAH after the fall of Shaikh . KHAZMAL . 17. The author cf the Military Handbook of 1924 maintained chat ’•Shaikh KHAZ’AL was powerful, a fact which was realised b the Persian Government and the BAKHTIARI and so long as he lived the province of ARABISTAN might ho-e for peace and prosperity^ while the day of his . death would be a bad day for iJIAEISTAN and possibly for the British as well”. In fact the British, apart of course from the cancellation of the original oil concession, accommodated themselves fairly well, and there does not appear to be much ground for supposing that public disorder or inter-tribal trouble have been any greater in KHUZISTMM since the ,Shaikhfe fall than before. The sufferers have been, as Shaikh KHAZ’AL knew at the time of the ABADAN purchase they would be, the Arab inhabitants of ‘ARABISTAN themselves . The contrast has been between the new Arab., govemiient, however faulty, of Iraq and the foreign, the infinitely more corrupt rule of a contemptuous authority embodying the insolent nation alism of ”Pahlevi” Iran. The connecting thread of all Arab discc rbent is hatred of Persian rule and resistance to Persifioation. 18. In July 1925 the MUHAISIN rose and sacked the MOHAMERAH bazaar, maddened by a rise in the date tax, by semi-famine conditions and by the prospect opened by the recent conscription bill. This should have been part of a larger rising, but the CHA’B Shaikhs could not agre^ and fought among themselves. The lining was pat down v/ith some bloodshed and the unhappy KHAZ’AL wes induced to temegraph to his son ’ABDULLAH then still representing the family 'eights in MOHAl-i ERiiH expressing his disapproval of the whole affair* Some concessions were however made to the culti vator^ grievances. ; - y _y6 SECKET 19* In May 1926 the BANT TAIvIIM wore in trouble for inurdering a Taxation Officer, and the Commander and 17 men of his escort of 20* The grievances on this occasion y/ere heavy tax demands and insulting behaviour to women and Shaikhs. Experiments were made after this in the installation first of a CHA’B Sheikh, and then of KHAZ’AL's son ’ABDULLAH in some sort of pararaountcy over the Arabs of KHCIZISTAN. In 1928 ca:ne the turn of the BANI TURUF who rose after violent measures by the police to enforce the wearing of the ‘Tahlevi hat ” in honour of a forthcoming visit of the Shah, and also because of oppression by Persian frontier officials. The BANI TURUF were out for three months and were only pacified when the revolt in Afghanistan diminished the Shah’s passion for forcible modifications of dross. In the following year in view of continued unrest Shaikh ’ABDULLAH ibn Shaikh KHAZ *AL serving as a Lieutenant in the Persian anny was removed to Tehran. Already at this date it was reported that the tribes were hoping for a return of KHAZ’AL’s eldest son CKASSIB. Since 1928 however there In vc been no major troubles in spite of fury caused by police methods of * enforcing the abolition of the veil and countless minor pinpricks. In 1935 MOHAMMERAH, PALAHIYA and IUIAFAJIYA lost their traditional Arab names in favour of new Iranian ones and the Arabs of ARABISTAN had to give way in the province’s name to the long vanished KHUZ. Yet another grievance is that the Arabs like other minorities are allowed no schools of their own. The Arab tribes are leaderless and '■onsciovts of their weakness: but a visitor to the BANI LAM in. 1942 was astonished at their bitterness. The heirs of Shaikh KHAZ ’A T, 20 « Shaikh KHAZ’ALMs considerable harem endowed him with 29 children including 13 sons (see Appendix ’D’). Of these only 3 sons (CHASSIB, ’ABDUL AZIZ and NIDHAM) and 3 daughters are in the fullest sense of the term legitimate, but all are entitled to a strmre of their father’s inheritance. There is a lamentable consensus of opinion that all the sons are worthless* The eldest Shaikh CHASSIB Ilian SAHDARI-i- ARFA’A in particular, who was undergoing treatment for syphlis if Paris at the time of his fayher’s arrest, squandered away his patrimony, and e ^ wo bis six wives to destitution. His own impoverished state was the force behind his recent moves to recover his inheritance, though e is said to have made a better shewing as Governor of KOHAliERAH in 1919* Nevertheless the KHUZISTAN Arabs have a pathetic belief that his years spent in England somehow give him a standing in English eyes. 21. _ The activities of Shaikh KHAZ’AL’s childien in the years ollowing their father’s fall are difficult to trace because they v/ere thought unworthy of record. Several are still living in TEHRAN, others have settled in BASRA whither in 193^ ’ABDUL MAJID escaped from police surveillance in TEHRAN to join CHASSIB lately returned from Europe. Some years back the British Government paid to the heirs a sun of money representing the. capitalised value of the tax imposed by the Iraq/ Government on their date gardens. (CHASSIB’s share was paid to his destitute first English wife) and this step has been taken to show that the British af'-,er all considered themselves morally bound by their °~: agreement though (presumably) any such deductions v/ere specifically refuted at the time ' J I Recent Developmen ts. u u F 1 event &gt; a part from an interview Shaikh CHASSIB states that he had with Mr. AUSTEN C1LTOEPIAIN, no political move would appear to have been made by any of -che family until after the Allied entry into Persia in 1941 . The sight of all the tribes, the QASHQAI, the KURDS, # + the/-- 7 - SE CRET the BAKHTIARI recovering their old position as the chiefs returned from the opened prisons then led to heart searchings among the impoverished IdLAZ’ALI exiles at B.ASRA* Oby should not they too recover the properties forced from their imprisoned father? The heirs of Shaikh KKAE’.AL had better claims on Allied goodwill than the heirs of SOLAT ud DOWLEH, the QASHQAX who had fought for WASSvIUSS. One of the sons. Shaikh I-IUKAIilAD SA'ID was at the time interned for supporting RASHID ALI, but he had been in the Iraqi Army and the rest of the family were in no way implicated* 23. At the end of 1941 therefore Shaikh ABDUL AZIZ, CHASSIS's full brother, paid an illegal visit to MQHAHMERAH to discover the lie of the land and in the spring of 1942 ambitious schemes were laid to oust the Persian acbninistration of KHUZISTATT. By then, of course, it was too late. Disturb ances in the area bordering the railway and the pipeline were highly undesirable, the British were committed to support the central government, and unmistakeable intimations from British and Iraqi sources were sufficient to prevent the matter from being put to the test. 24* In January 1943 however Shaikh CHASSID wrote to H.k. Ambassador in BAGHDAD requesting to be restored to the family property and honours. He does not appear to have received a reply. On 4th Lay 1943&gt; selecting the moment when the Persian forces in IC 1 UZI 8 TAN were involved with the B/iKHTIARI at IZEH he took the bit betv/een his teeth, croeced the frontier with his unbalanced half brother ’ABDUL loAJID and a few supporters and attempted to rally the Arabs at QAJARIXA. He secured a limited following chiefly from among his own tribe the LUKAISIN, but was induced by the Consul and A.L.O. to return to MOHAfcLlERAH# There the Arabs vehemently opposed his return to Iraq and drew up a petition to this effect (Appendix ’E 1 ), but they and he eventually yielded to British pressure, and by the 15th he was back in BASRA. The Persians sent aeroplanes over QAJARIYA where all the tribesmen bn.d not yet dispersed and caused a few casualties, but there were no further reprisals and H.M. Minister in TEHRAN took the opportunity to urge on the Persian Government a settlement of the KHAZ’ALI claims. 25* The outcome of this last step was an offer by the Persian Government to compensate for the KHiZHALI’s claims in KEUZISTAN by a grant of land ^ in the neighbourhood of TEHRAN. The HUHAISIN Shaikhs considering that this would be the death blow to their hopes of at least a send.— autonomous Arab government in Southern Khusistan made a counter offer of a voluntary gift of a proportion of the income of their own and other dis puted estates, and this proposal was welcomed by Sheikh ’ABDULLAH, probably the most estimable of the KHAZ’ALIs, on the grounds; (1) That in view of the return of the other tribal leaders to their estates, the KHAZ’ALIs had a sound claim to similar treatment. (2) That the Persian Cove rumen c were not co be trusted and that if once the KHAZ’ALIs signed a document renouncing their claims in KHUZISTAN some excuse would soon be found to deprive them of their new property. (3) That they had not the money necessary for the intrigues in TEHRAN Which would inevitably precede such a settlement. (4) That to take such a step would indeed be the abanuorm»nt of the Arabs of KHUZISTAN. With ’ABDULLAH tire last consideration undoubtedly had weight. 26. On 11th June 1944&gt; CHASSIB wrote a letter to H.li. Ambassador in BAGHDAD, complaining that his family was in a bad way financially, and asking the British to back him up in his claims for the return of the KHAZ’ALI estates. He claimed that H.M.G. had not honoured a word of the promises/SECRET b - they had made to his father, and said the tribes were ready to fight at ary time against 'their sole enemy', Persia, The Embassy replied that the pledge given to KELAZ r iL depended on his remaining a loyal subject of Persia; if CHASSIS persisted in re gaming the lawful Persian Government as his enemy, he could expect no more help from the British# '« r •- 27* At the beginning of July rumours again said that the brothers had declared that they were going back to KHUZISTAN to lead a revolt. On instructions the British Consul-General in B'ISRA visited them, and'H found them still divided in counsel. CHASSIS ceald not deciae whether or not he should go to TEHRAN and negotiate. He v/anted the British Embassy there to back him up,, at the least if he made no headway. As well as this he wanted the Persians to guarantee that whatever happened they would let him go back to Iraq,. But it proved impossible to extract any definite pledge from the Persians* None the less CHASSIB wrote a. letter addressed to the Sheikhs of ARA3ISTAN appointing his brother./. •ABDULLAH as his deputy (presumably during OH ASS IB i s absence in TEHRAN). •ABDULLAH, however, taking a. more aggressive line crew up a constitution for a principality &lt;:P KHQSISTAN (based on a very C arge measure of autonomy) which, said, h.e was going to submit to the f:ikhs ''at . the earliest oppe urHty'h Towards the middle of the m •. , the Persians f gave permission for CHASSIS to come to TEHRAN and the Ii qis agreed to him have a visa, •- long as he v;ent through KHAITAQIN, not KHUZISTidL However on the very next day ABDULLAH announced his intention of crossing the frontier that afternoon to raise rebellion. The acting hutasarrif tried to reason with him; he refused to listen ant both he and CHASSIB, who thereupon declared that he agreed fully with his brother's plans, were arrested. From, hints it was deduced thut ABDULLAH'S scheme.ywas to stir up trouble to back CHASSIB while the latter negotiated ±i% .TEHRAN. Both brothers were remo ved to ALIARA and there pic cod. in the internment camp. What was i.ncorTprehensi'ble was that throughout this period.; . ABDULLAH had kerb British officials in BASRii fully informed of,his g . intentions, and by awiouroirg his impending departure for Persia had- in fact invited arrest* , . ( . 28. The re-actions of the Arabs in KHUZISTAN to the arrest of the 0 two brothers were no doubt disappointing to them. The Arabs to the North-East of AHWAZ having recently undergone disarmament operations at the hands of the Persian Army took no notice at all; to the South .at QUSBAH and MANTUHI, people regretted the arrest p two such p..omi:^nt KHAZ’ALs as CHASSIB and ABDULLAH but said nothing more^ 29* Meanwhile, the detention of the KHAZ'ALs did not prevent , arrangements going forward as before for their journey to TEHRAN, and this was fixed for July 25th. However, as soon j.s they got to BAGHDAD, they declared they were being deported and handed over helpless to the Persians,, at which the arrangements were immediately cancelled and they were made to take up forced residence at the Babylon Hotel in BAGHDAD. ABDULLAH then wrote to the Embassy in BAGHDAD begging for he?.p on the grounds of extreme poverty, while CHASSIB wrote to the Ministry of Interior asking eo -• .r for release from forced residence dor an allowance to enable tne brothers go stay alive® Early in January of 1945 they were .all/ ccd to return to BASRA on an undertaking to inter fere no further in ;ho affair^ Trtjr-. 30. In October of tha' was reported that he propos in the K/iRUl\ T area. to CHASS J3B finally went to TEHTUN and it band as Majlis c jputy for the ^irabs 31* ^ By December, bnere were already reports tiiat ABDULLAH was age- in preparing to lead a revolt. Rumours Dugan to be heard of a secret visit made by him go one Persian bank of the SlATT-al-ARAB, of messengers coming from across the fx’ontier, and even of a minor tribal gathering one night to support a move across the river which never came off, ABDULLAH ev v n ... told/.... KHDRRAidSHAHR/- 9 SECRET told the Political Adviser at BASRA that he was intending to lead a revolt. In the midst of this CHASSIS suddenly wrote a letter from TEHRAN to ABDULLAH saying that he had heard rumours that he was indulging in activities harmful to KHAZ*ALI interests: he ordered ABDULLAH to take no action likely to interfere with the rim of their affairs. It was later strongly suspected that this letter was sheer humbug designed to allay suspicion, 32* On the night of January 9/lOth ABDULLAH suddenly crossed into KHUZISTAN with a small following of about fifty men, and established himself in his late father’s palace at FAILIYA, disarming eight Gendarmes and evict ing a Persian Customs Post, He then sent a letter to the Governor • . of KHORRAMSHAHR, with a copy to the British Consul saying that he had come back only to look after his own personal interests. But although -t^raD rumours had predicted four thousand supporters for him 'by nightfall, the CHA'B refused point blank to O oin while the LTJHEISIN would say no more than that they would help if he was still taeie after two days. In the Soutnem part of ABADAN island the NASSAU tribe was porsuaued by its Shaikhs noc to join in the rebellion, Persian Gendarmes with half a battalion of troops threw a cordon round the FAILIYA area to stop any would-be recruits for the KHAZ’ALI cause. There v/as some sniping and at nightfall on the 10th reinforcements including artillery arrived from AHwAZ, led by the Divisional Commander. At dawn the Persians attacked, but found the palaces deserted, ABDULLAH, having fled by launch during the night* For two days ABDULLAH’s whereabouts wex , e a mystery, and although an Iraqi gunboat patrolled the river, no trace could be found of him. On the 13th of January he turned up in KUWEIT, where he successfully sought sanctuary with t he Ruler* He declared that he was staying there till he could make his peace either with Persia or Iraq* In KUWEIT, the Ruler forbad ABDULLAH to carcy on any political activity and gave categorical assurances for his good behaviour to the Political Agent. 33* Bail had been put up for ABDULLAH at the time of his release from forced residence in BAGHDAD. The sum involved was ID*3000 but as the guarantor was a deputy and shortly afterwards became a Senator the Iraqi authorities do not seem to have pressed the matter* ABDULLAH'S attempted rebellion was the subject of great interest by the Russian Consul in AHWAZ, and a few days afterwards PRAVDA printed an imaginative account of it stating that 300 armed Arabs had sacked KHORRiAKHAHR: in the light of subsequent Tudeh development in this area, Russian interest in possible Arab opposition is not surprising. Meanwhile there had been no word of CHASSIB in TEHRAN* 3A. Towards the middle of June 1^46 Tudeh Party penetration of the KHUZISTAN area rapidly assumed menacing proportions* To meet this threat a number of prominent Arabs proposed the idea of an Artb Union. At first, it seemed that one of its aims would be the promotion of KHAZ’ALI interests and the records of most of the leaders of the movement showed them to be pro -KHAZ * ATT . However, this possibility seemed to be cut out when ADD UR HEZZAQ JABBAR al CHA’B one of the leading CHA’B Shaikhs ana a well-known opponent of the KHAZ’ALs associated himself with the movement. At a meeting on the 11th of June agreement was reached on general principles and the Union v/as officially constituted on 15th June at a luncheon party at the house of one Hajji HADDAD, a. prominent contractor, near UIOHRA-SHAHR? The Headquarters of the Union were set up at KUT es SHEIKH. Further and larger meetings were held on 13th June and 23id; at the seo.-nd gathering, a crowd of some 10,000 Arabs were reported to have been present, including Sheikhs from ail over KHUZISTAN. The aims of the Union (as proclaimed) wore local autonomy for KHUZISTAN on the lines of that given to AZERBAIJAN and the stamping out of Tudeh interference in Arab affairs. 33. On ?th July, with a steadily deteriorating security situation in KHUZISTAN (there had already been dangerous and large scale Tudeh strikes in various parts of the AlOC.area) Sheikh CHASSIB suddenly arrived in- 10 - SECRET KHORRArlSHAHR from TEHRAN - =. He put up at the house of his sister m KUT es SHEIKH, and stated that he merely wished to live in peace in his own^ country. His arrival was greeted with deep suspicion by nearly all the Arabs, even those normally warm supporters of the ICIAE'ALs. Several of them visited him bit could obtain no inkling of his real indention. The absence of any police watch on his house increased distrus ^ and there were strong rumours that he had come to an understanding witnihe prime Minister, thus com .etely betraying family traditions* During uie oloody events which marked the strike of 14 th and 15 th July, when the os in ABADAN suffered heavy losses and the .,n b cause was seriously impaired by the attitude of the authorities, nothing was heard of CHASSID. The Present Position. 36 . The moment of writing (August 1946) finds the Arabs of South^ Persia united for the first time in a Nationalist cause with no immediate connection with a KHAZhALI restorationt, The struggle between the Arab Tribal Union and the Tudeh Party quickly turned from a political to a racial issue, and the attitude of certain Persian Government officials has once again raised Arab hatred for the Iranian state. It is important to note that the Arabs have fought and died together in this cause without the participation of Sheikh ABDULLAH or Sheikh CHASSID: the latter is in fact under grave suspicion of connivance with the Persian Prime ianister, and in consequence his stock with the Arabs could hardly be lower, _ ABDULLAH still has some prestige though in the hei of the struggle few will have had time to think of him. He is still in KUWEIT and a question by him as to how H.M.G, would view his return met with the definite reply that it could in no circumstances be countenanced. The Sheikh of KUWEIT has been asked to take special care to prevent his escape, but the possibility exists, and the consequences of his landing in' ARABISTAN at a time of such confusion would be quite unpredictable. Although at the moment Arab allegience belongs to a cause other than his own and although his last effort raised so little enthusiasm among his father's subjects, he might still find it possible to turn the situation to his advantage' and become the leader of an Arab revolt. &lt;....... appointed/- APPENDIX f A t » Driperial Firman of 190 ^.

However, since we are very much anxious to have a paramount chief of our own we wish to bring to your kind notice that Shaikh Chassib Khaz all who had a good experience in tribal administration during &gt; his late father’s ruling and the fact that Sheikh Chassib was for 15 years m Europe particularly in England and knows more than anybody else in this country about the manners of English people, we therefore have unanimously elected him as our paramount chief and leader. . Under these circumstances we earnestly request you to forward our application to the British authorities concerned in whose goodwill and sympathy towards us we have much confidence and certain that our case will receive every support by them.

Lorimer’s Grazetteer, Vol. I., Part II. British interests in Ardbistan at the close of the last century. KHAZAL KHAN succeeded, at the age of 36, to the Sheikhdom of Mohammerah on the murder of his elder brother, Mizal Khan, on the 2nd June, 1897. At that time British policy in Persia was governed, as it has invariably been since, by inter-acting strategic and economic considerations. In the strategic field, the basic consideration was the defence of India, and this involved watching and countering Russian political and economic thrusts from the north; to this end the British Government pursued a policy of strengthening the weak buffer State while also endeavouring to build up a position in the south so as not to be caught at a disadvantage should that buffer State disintegrate. British defence schemes, based as they were on naval power, made the Persian Gulf a region of great strategic importance to India, and therefore to this country, and it was necessary to watch the activities not only of Russia but also of Germany and Turkey in that region. An essential part of British policy in the Gulf was the establish ment of good relations and the conclusion of treaties with the various Arab rulers, and the Sheikhs of Mohammerah, controlling territory at the head of the Gulf, thus came very prominently into the general scheme. In the economic field also, although the days of the d’Arcy concession and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had not yet arrived, British and Indian interests were considerable : Mohammerah was a port of call for British India Steam Navigation Company’s vessels, a British Indian post office had been established there, a British firm (Messrs. Lynch) controlled the only non-Persian navigation service on the River Karun (which had been opened to navigation in 1888) and British interests were concerned in various road and railway projects in Arabistan. 2. The Sheikhs of Mohammerah, who were chiefs of the Muhaisin division of the the Chaab Arabs, were nominally Persian subjects, but they enjoyed in Arabistan a large measure of autonomy and semi-independence in the administra tion of their territories. The latter, which derived from hereditary occupation, extended beyond Ahwaz and generally covered almost the whole' of southern Arabistan, while, in addition, the Sheikhs had large interests to the west of the Shatt-el-Arab in what was recognised as Turkish territory—including the allegiance of members of their own tribe engaged in cultivation there. Thev British Government had established friendly relations with Sheikh Jabir of of Mohammerah and had supported him after the Anglo-Persian war of 1857, and these relations were continued after the accession of his son Mizal Khan to the sheikhdom in 1881; later, however, owing to his annoyance at the competition of Messrs. Lynch with himself in the carrying trade on the Karun and at actions of the British Vice-Consul at Mohammerah in appealing to Persian authorities against his proceedings, and also owing to his fear of incurring the distrust of the Persian Government, MizaTs relations with the British deteriorated. In 1895, when disaffection towards Mizal became rife among his own tribesmen, Khazal Khan, whose accession to the sheikhdom began to appear probable, assured the British Vice-Consul that his political salvation lay in assisting and not opposing the British and that if. as Sheikh, he should be called upon to choose a policy, it would be one of sincere friendship with the British Government, although political exigencies might dictate concealment of its real nature. t Conf. 9748, Nos. 101 and 203. Early British assurances to the Sheikh, 1899-1903. 3. On his accession, Sheikh Khazal, guided by his principal adviser, the shrewd and able Hadji Mohamed Ali Behbehani, Rais-et-Tuj jar, pursued a policy of strengthening his rule both around Mohammerah and in other districts to which his family had traditional claims and of seeking to establish his position vis-a-vis of the Persian Government. The negotiations with the Central Govern ment at Tehran were in the hands of the Rais-et-Tuj jar and the British Legation assisted with their advice. Eventually, in 1903, the Sheikh received firmans from the Shah which recognised as “perpetual properties” the lands of the Sheikh and his tribes at Mohammerah, Abadan Island, Bahmanshir, Karun, Hindyan, Dehmulla and Fallahiyeh; these firmans stipulated that the Sheikh should pay only the usual annual revenues to the Persian Government and that the latter should have no right to take possession of, or interfere with, the properties (or alternatively, if they should acquire them, should pay a reasonable price to the Sheikh); there was also a stipulation (which became important later m connexion with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession) that the proper ties must not be sold or transferred to foreigners, but there was no ban on their being leased. O4, On his accession, Sheikh Khazal lost no time in again informing His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah of his friendship for the British Govern ment and of his desire to serve them, and in November, 1898, alarmed at the course of his discussions with the Persian Government, he expressed the wish to be taken secretly under British protection; he did not press for a written assurance, nor did he ask for an alliance against the Persian Government, whom Lorimer’s he professed to have served faithfully and whom he would 1 continue to serve, v a Tr teer, i 7 M but he thought the British Government should not allow his influence to be et seq VV 5 diminished by the Persian Government. Later he informed the British Resident in the Persian Gulf that he apprehended an early downfall of the Persian monarchy, followed by a general scramble and partition of the kingdom, in which case he was anxious that his lot should be thrown in with the British Government. Acting on instructions from the British Minister at Tehran, the Political Resident informed! the Sheikh in May, 1899, to the following effect Conf. 10039 . We could not, of course, undertake to maintain the Sheikh against the Persian Government, nor could we say that, if the latter were to break up, we could guarantee his independence; the British Government did not con template such an contingency; but we regarded him as the most influential person in this part of the world and we intended as far as possible to support him, believing that it was in the interest of the country that he should be strong; if ever he wanted our advice we would give it; in return we expected that he would help us in matters of trade, &amp;c.; he could rely upon our goodwill at all times, and upon our help whenever we could give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government. Ditto, No. 406. „ 5. In 1902, as a result of expressed fears of Russia, the Sheikh pressed lor additional and written assurances, and His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, jnthe knowledge that a Russian consular officer was to be appointed in Arabistan conf 8215 (w^here Russian trade was non-existent), and in view of the possibility that the Nos - ^ ™ u ^ turn to the Russians for support, urged that something should be done to instil into the Sheikh real confidence in the strength and resolution ° f u Government, In the result, Sir A. Hardinge addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 7th December, 1902 (the text of which is reproduced as document No. 1 in the annex), assuring him that we would protect Mohammerah Dj tto No. 406. against naval attack by any foreign Power (whatever might be alleged as pretext for such action) and, also, as long as he remained faithful to the Shah and acted according to our advice, we should continue to give him our good offices and support. Prior to the despatch of this letter, His Majesty’s Minister informed the Grand Vizier orally that he had no wish to call in question the Shah s sovereignty over the Sheikh and his people, which His Majesty’s Govern ment had always recognised; but His Majesty’s Government were determined to support the Sheikh against attempts by Russian agents to intimidate him or to insinuate that they could bring pressure to bear on him owing to the influence which Russia exercised at Tehran. (His Majesty’s Government’s attitude m the matter was subsequently made clear in writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.) ^ -^ ecem ^ er ’ 1903, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran proceeded to the t0 J 11661 ^ he T Vlcer °y’ and on his return journey was visited by Sheikh Khazal at Mohammerah. The Sheikh then complained that the Persian Government were not abiding by their undertakings given in the previous year, both as regards the administration of Customs at Mohammerah and the Conf. 8410 payment of Customs duties by himself, and that they were attemptino* graduallv No - ^ 6 - to pare away his authority and destroy the prestige on which it rested He contrasted the measure of support which he obtained from His Maiestv’s Govern ment with that accorded by them to the Sheikhs of Koweit andf^rein and asked whether His Majesty s Government would now give him a definite promise of support m the event of the Persian Government’s repudiating the bargain they had made with him. In the course of this conversation the Sheikh mentioned that the Russians were quite prepared to give him promises of protection and Sir A. Hardinge thought it not improbable that, if we withheld our support from him, he might enter into some secret arrangement with them After mrwnH-a tion with the Foreign Office and the Government of India, Sir A Hardine-e addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 24th December, 1903 stating that the latter might rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as he, on his own side, observed the conditions of the arrangement made with the Persian Government; the text of this letter is reproduced as document No 2 in the annex. The reply of the Sheikh to this letter was given orally on his behalf [32557] b 2 Conf. 8410, No. 111.4 -• i J . / Conf. 8410, No. 150 Conf. 8436, No, 10S: Conf. 9302, No, 99. Conf. 9302, No. 205.

Later in the year, however, the Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the Sheikh was chafing at the difficulties and uncertainty of his relations with, and position under, the Shah’s Government, and was at heart dissatisfied at the limited measure of support which the British Government had been able to promise him. Renewals and Am/plification of British Assurances, 1908-10. 7. In the years following the British assurances, Sheikh Khazal appears to have suffered little serious interference from the central Government, who, in their weakness and in the chaotic situation in the country generally, appear to have been content to allow the Sheikh to rule undisturbed over his territories : in fact, the Sheikh actually complained to His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah in October, 1907, that, while the Persian press and the Majlis were attacking him on various counts, he was being left to his own resources in policing the Shatt-el-Arab and suppressing disorders amongst the Persian tribes. He expressed a similar view to the British Resident in January, 1908, complaining that he was left to defend the frontier against Turkey, and had to meet heavy expenditure which should have been borne by the central Government; (actually, although Turkey was making trouble further north, she had not extended such activities to the Sheikh’s territories). 8. At the meeting with Major (afterwards Sir Percy) Cox in January, 1908, the Sheikh, influenced partly by recent assurances given to the Sheikh of Koweit (with whom he was on terms of close friendship) and by the advent of constitu tional government in Persia, raised again the question of the British assurances, saying that it was vital for him to know what would be the policy of His Majesty’s Government, as far as he was concerned, in the event of (a) the break-up of Persia, or (b) an attempt by the Majlis (as opposed to the former absolute govern ment of the Shah) ‘ ‘ to reduce him to nothing ”; he asked for an assurance in writing which should apply not only to himself but to his heirs, in return for which he offered to bind himself to the British Government in any way considered feasible. In reporting this conversation, the Political Resident expressed the opinion that the Sheikh was primarily sincere in his protestations that his hopes and interests were centred on the British Government, but that he was never theless mainly prompted by the dictates of self-preservation and that, failing satisfaction from us, he might turn to the Germans for support. The Foreign Office todk the view that the Sheikh, by reason of the geographical situation of his possessions and by his considerable local influence, was in a position to hinder, or even prevent, the prosecution of any foreign enterprise in the country watered by the Karun, and that it was very desirable to secure his absolute adherence to British interests in order to ensure that his power might always be exercised in their^ favour by opposing any schemes which might be distasteful to His Majesty’s Government; they were, therefore, disposed to repeat the previous assurances, applying them to the Sheikh’s successor and amplifying them by a form of words which would include the continuance of the Sheikh’s existing state of autonomy. 9. After consultation with the Government of India, the Political Resident received instructions to address a written assurance to the Sheikh, which he did in a letter of the 1st December, 1908, the text of which is given as document No. 3 in the annex. 10. These renewed and amplified assurances failed to satisfy the Sheikh, who, in March, 1909, complained to the Political Resident that they safeguarded him only as long as Persia remained a sovereign State; he wished the guarantee to be extended m such a manner as to make it effective m the event of Persia’s being occupied by foreign Powers or ceasing to be an independent State as a result of foreign intervention; above all he wanted an assurance to the effect that, provided he and his heirs and tribesmen continued to show themselves amenable to British advice and faithful to British interests, their possessions would be guaranteed to them. In addition, he asked for advice whether to side with the Royalists or Nationalists, both of which parties had been calling upon him to throw in his lot with them, declaring that he must inevitably take one side or the other and expressing his fear that, if he came to a decision without our advice, we might withdraw our guarantee on the ground that his decision was unsatisfactory to us. Lastly, he appealed for a loan, saying that, if we could i r vdo nothing for him, we must not object to his applying elsewhere; (hints of the establishment of relations with other Powers, were, as has been seen, part of his- stock bargaining assets). 11. As regards the proposed loan, neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Government of India were at first anxious themselves to make an advance to the Sheikh, who, however, showed his hand by obtaining a loan of £1,000 from the German firm, Wondkhaus and Company. Details of the subsequent discussions need not here be given, but eventually it was arranged that His Majesty’s Government should advance a sum of £10,000, the amount actually being furnished by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who, by an agreement signed with the Sheikh on the 16th July, 1909, secured the lease of valuable sites on Abadan island and elsewhere. It may be mentioned also that two months earlier assurances had been obtained from the Sheikh regarding prior British rights in irrigation projects on the Karun and other rivers in his territories. 12. The request of the Sheikh for advice as to the action he should take vis-a-vis of the Royalists and Nationalists was met by the recommendation not to involve himself in Persian party politics. As regards the Sheikh’s desire for further assurances, the Political Resident had several conversations with the Sheikh, to whom he eventually addressed a letter on the 16th May, 1909 (the text of which is reproduced as document No. 4 in the Annex). The new assurances were in the following words :— I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia, the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now prepared to extend the application of those assurances to your ‘ heirs and successors.’” 13. The Sheikh was still not satisfied and in discussions with the Political Resident stated that he wished the assurances to be made applicable for a period of 100 years to his male descendants rather than to his “ heirs and successors.” The reason for the request to extend the assurances to his male descendants was that he feared that his nephew Hanzal might seize some favourable opportunity X) effect his own (Khazal s) or his eldest son’s (Chassib’s) assassination and usurp the sheikhdom; and that for a stated period was that he feared that at some future date the British Government might find it necessary to intervene in Southern Persia and perhaps find it convenient to take over Mohammerah, when he might lose his privileges and revenues—^in which case he would like an under taking that he would continue to enjoy his personal revenue and be granted an asylum in India or elsewhere. Finally, he asked for a form of written assurances which he could show to his tribesmen to quiet their apprehensions and to strengthen their support of himself and their faith in the friendly policy of the British Government. ^ F ^ /v Th ere was considerable delay before fresh assurances were given to the bheikh who, for a number of reasons, was becoming anxious as to his position. In the first place he was concerned at the growing influence at Tehran of the Bakhtiari Ministei of the Interior, Sardar Assad, who was hostile to himself, and early m 1910 Sheikh Khazal was speaking of intervention in Persian politics; he was, however, told that his best policy was to continue his allegiance to the Central Government, to whom he should submit any grievances, and that His Majesty’s Legation would support him if he were refused satisfaction. The Sheikh expressed his readiness to comply with this advice but wished in return for an assurance protection against the Bakhtiari; this, however, His Majesty’s Government considered both unnecessary and undesirable. 15. Later in the year matters were complicated by the action of the Vali of Basra, who, because of alleged actions of the Sheikh’s followers in Turkish territory and of the Sheikh’s refusal to surrender one of his tribal chiefs (of Persian nationality), sent a gun-boat which shelled one of the Sheikh’s villages on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab. The Sheikh, who expressed his readi ness to raise his whole territory against the Turks, was, however, prepared to be guided by His Majesty’s Government in this matter, and the latter found themselves m a position of having to implement their assurances against attack from a foreign Power. While holding a warship in readiness to proceed to Mohammerah if necessary, they found it possible to safeguard the Sheikh’s position without resorting to hostilities; it was, however, deemed desirable to counteract a certain amount of loss of prestige suffered by the Sheikh and also to make a demonstration in face of the growth of Turkish ambitions in the Conf. 9540, No. 435.

The presentation of the insignia took place with due ceremony at the Sheikh’s palace at Failiyah on the 15th October, 1910. In his speech the Political Resident referred to His Majesty s Government’s good-will and esteem and to their appreciation of the Sheikh’s sustained efforts to preserve order and security for trade in the districts under his control. In his reply, the Sheikh spoke of the friendship between the Persian and British Governments and of his hopes that he might be able to render service and devotion to the former and to earn the approval of the latter. As regards the assurances, the Political Resi dent addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 15th October, the text of which is reproduced as document No. 5 in the Annex, and also another in identic terms ^ (except for the omission of the words ££ to be acceptable to your tribesmen”) which the Sheikh could show, if necessary, to the headmen of the tribes under his control. The written assurances were accompanied by an important oral statement by the Political Resident, in the presence of His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah and the Rais-et-Tujjar, to the effect that the Sheikh must under stand that circumstances might arise in which it would be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to intervene by force on his behalf. The Sheikh replied that he quite understood this and that it was sufficient for him to know that His Majesty’s Government really meant to safeguard him to the best of their ability in case of emergency. Thus ended a long chapter, to which need be added only the fact that in the following December the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to His Majesty’s Minister on the subject of the Sheikh, saying that information had been received that the latter was under British protection; to this Sir G. Barclay replied that the Sheikh was not a British protected person but that His Majesty’s Government had special relations with him, and that, in the event of any encroachment on his rights, he would receive their support; the text of the assurances were not, however, communicated to thei Persian Government. The Assurances of 191^. 17. In December, 1913 (at a time when His Majesty’s Government were contemplating the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), the Sheikh asked Sir Percy Cox for further assurances on the following lines :— (a) that we should make the position regarding the succession more secure by a modification of the existing assurances; (5) that we would take cognisance of a definite peace compact between the Sheikh and the Bakhtiaris which would render him immune from the necessity and expense of protecting his territory against their aggression; and {c) that we should endeavour to devise and take measures with the Persian Government to secure to him the status of local autonomy to which Q the history of the past entitled him and which he was then enjoying in practice, although on a precarious basis. These matters were still under discussion by His Majesty’s Government when the outbreak of war in 1914 transformed the' situation; the disintegration of Persia and the encroachment of Russia, which had previously been the main pre occupation of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, were eclipsed by the more immediate menace from Germany and Turkey, and it was regarded as clearly essential that we should reaffirm and strengthen our assurances to the Sheikh, who, there was reason to believe, was ready to act in collusion with the Sheikh of Koweit, with Ibn Saud and with certain notables of Basra, in preparing the way for a peaceful British occupation of that port. The Government of India now recommended that the former assurances should be reaffirmed and strengthened and that, in addition, we should undertake to maintain the Sheikh in secure and untaxed possession of his date gardens on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab. 18. On the 3rd November, 1914 (z.e., before the formal announcement by His Majesty’s Government on the 5th November that a state of war existed with Turkey but at a time when hostilities had actually commenced), Colonel Knox,the acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, addressed a letter to the Sheikh containing the revised assurances. The text of this letter need not be reproduced here because it mentioned the co-operation to be expected from the Sheikh in the capture of Basra, and, as the question of such co-operation did not actually arise, the Sheikh, after the capture of Basra, asked for a revised letter from which the passages relating thereto should be omitted. Sir P. Cox therefore addressed to him a new letter bearing the date the 22nd November, 1914 (i.e., that on which Basra was occupied by British forces), which became the master document, the text of which is reproduced as document No. 6 in the annex. The War Period. 19. It may be recorded briefly that the Sheikh was of positive assistance to His Majesty’s Government during the war, largely by his maintenance of order in that part of Persia where British interests were so considerable. This was particu larly the case in 1915 when certain unruly tribes under his jurisdiction, incited by the preaching of a jehad by Turkish agents, rose in revolt and assisted the Turks C onf 13055 * in an attack on British troops at Ahwaz and in cutting the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s pipe line; on that occasion the Sheikh did much to facilitate the rapid restitution of order as soon as the Turks had been driven back. Towards the end of 1915, when it appeared probable for a time that Persia would intervene in the war on the side of the enemy, there was some discussion of recognising the Sheikh’s independence in that event, but, as the emergency never in fact occurred, Conf. 11794 .* Sir P. Cox’s letter of the 22nd November, 1914, remained the final embodiment of His Majesty’s Government’s commitments to the Sheikh. The Post-War Period, 1919-20. 20. The end of hostilities in Europe and in the Ottoman Empire brought little improvement in the state of Persia, which continued to exercise His Majesty’s Government. The danger from Germany and Turkey was now removed but that from Russia was revived in a new form—Bolshevism. The Sheikh’s territories, by contrast, remained generally quiet, to the benefit of British interests which had grown enormously. Although order was maintained in the Sheikh’s territories, this was achieved only by autocratic and oppressive rule and the Sheikh was no longer a popular ruler. He maintained his control of the tribes by a policy of breaking the power of any sheikh or tribe likely to become too strong and a danger to his rule, replacing the suspected leaders by agents of his own selection whb governed the tribes and collected revenue from them; in the process, incidentally, he acquired personal possession of much property. He now feared for his life, and Chassib Khan, his eldest son, whom he had appointed as Governor of Mohammerah in 1919, came under suspicion, as a result of which he was removed from his post in 1921 and thenceforward carefully watched. Khazal continued to enjoy the support of His Majesty’s Government, who, however, had not, in his opinion, sufficiently rewarded him for his past services. (In particular, he was disappointed that Feisal ibn Hussein had been chosen as King of Iraq rather than himself.) The rise of Reza Khan. 21. The beginning of the decline of the Sheikh’s power coincided with, and was a direct result of, the rise of Reza Khan, who was ultimately personally responsible for the Sheikh’s complete downfall. General Reza Khan arrived at Tehran with his force of Cossacks in February, 1921, took control of the capital and from that time, until he became Prime Minister himself in October, 1923, was, as Minister of War, the main force in Persian politics His immediate policy was to bring the country under the control of the Central Government, and for this purpose he organised military formations in the distant parts which had hitherto been largely outside the control of the Government; at first, however, he found it politic to leave the Sheikh’s territories alone. FinanciaZ dispute between the Sheikh and the Persian Govemment. 22. Prior to the advent of Reza Khan, the Central Government had been showing resentment at the prosperity of Arabistan from which they were deriving no direct financial benefit owing to {a) the non-pavment by the Sheikh of his annual revenue (maliyat), and (b) the appropriation to himself by the Sheikh of all indirect taxation. It is unnecessary here to enter into details of the Conf. 13055,* p. 222. Ditto, p. 220. VC8 Conf. 12004, No. 175. E 2003/2003/ 34/1922. E3121/6/34/ 1922. E4348/6/34/ 1922. E4931/6/34/ 1922.

E7260/6/34/ 1922. early negotiations between the Sheikh and the Central Government, but the position at the end of 1921 was briefly as follows:— The Sheikh had paid no maliyat since 1913 but, on the other hand, was claiming from the Persian Government sums which he had expended during the war in maintaining law and order in Arabistan without any assistance from the Persian Government. After prolonged negotiations, in which His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran had lent support to the Sheikh, Vossugh- ed-Dowleh had agreed to waive the payment of maliyat for the war period and to accept a moiety for six years as from 1920. Unfortunately, matters were not put on a formal basis and the Sheikh was not fully satisfied and refused to continue payment. Qawam-es-Sultaneh stated that neither his Government nor the Majlis would accept the settlement to which Vossugh-ed- Dowleh had agreed, but had offered to waive the war-time revenues in exchange for the payment in full as from 1920. To this, however, the Sheikh would not agree unless arrangements were made by which the Persian Government would meet part of the recurring expenditure in maintaining law and order in Southern Arabistan, and when, earlv in 1922, proposals ^ to this effect were advanced, he would accept no compromise in spite of f advice from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, who regarded the proposed i terms as reasonable. * -rj MnUers took a new turn in April, 1922, when it was learned that the Persian Government proposed to send troops into Arabistan to compel the Sheikh to pay his revenue. The Sheikh now asked for British intervention, appealing to the assurances given to him and declaring t/hat the despatch of a small force to Arabistan would lead to unrest and anarchy, with consequent loss to British commercial interests. On learning of this, Sir P. Loraine requested the Political Resident to see the Sheikh and speak to him seriously : the Sheikh had onlv himself to blame, and while the British obligations to him were fully recognised they were clearly not intended to protect him from discharging his obligations to the Persian Government; the undesirability of the despatch of Persian troops to Arabistan from the British point was also fully realised, but the Minister ot War (who was responsible) was an opponent of the Bolsheviks and might therefore prove an asset to His Majesty’s Government, and Sir P. Loraine did not wish to take up a bad case with him; the first essential was, therefore thatU the Sheikh should come to a reasonable settlement with the Persian Government the Political Resident, being unable himself to see the Sheikh, instructed His Majesty s Consul at Ahwaz to impress upon the Sheikh that, if he desired British ? u PP or ^ m .accordance with the 1914 assurances, he must fulfil his obligations to the Persian Government, among the first of which was the payment of revenue. 1 his produced what appeared to be a satisfactory settlement, the Sheikh promising to pay two years arrears of revenue on being released from payments nf thl g fl the Wai h J he ^ tter wa s n J&gt;L however, finally settled as the actual amount of the arrears had not been fixed, but early in June Sir P. Loraine thought that the matter could be settled without his intervention and did not think that the despatch of troops to Arabistan was likely to materialise. The despatch of Persian troops to Arabistan, 1922. t&gt; the 18t ^ 192 ?’ Sir Loraine received information that they ersian Government had despatched a force of 500 men for Arabistan and at once caused representations to be made to the Minister of War and Prime Minister calling attention to the possible resultant dangers to British interests. The Prime Minister said that on grounds of prestige he could not recall the troops (which were merely to form a bodyguard for the Governor at Shushtar) but expressed his and Keza Khan s readiness to give formal assurances to the Sheikh that the troops would not interfere with the Sheikh’s territory or the Arab tribes. On the same day Sir P. Loraine sent for two leading Bakhtiari Khans, explaining the situation and the action taken; it was agreed that the interests of the Bakhtiari the Jieikh and His Majesty s Government were identical in this matter and that the Bakhtians and the Sheikh should support the representations of His Majesty’s Legation; the Khans proposed force, but Sir P. Loraine said that thm must be absolutely the last resort and ought not to be necessary. The Foreign Office were somewhat disturbed by the report of this interview and made it clear to Sir P. Loraine that His Majesty’s Government must not committed to embarrassing obligations towards the Bakhtians: Sir P. Loraine was instructed to employ all his efforts to induce the Persian Government to abandon any intern ti°n as regards Southern Arabistan, but was informed that there seemed to be[32557] c 9 little reason to object to the “bodyguard” proposal outside the Sheikhs territories. Matters appeared to be fairly satisfactory when the Prime Minister assured Sir P. Loraine on the 24th July that neither the Sheikh nor his interests e 7398/6/34/ nor those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would be interfered with or 19 • threatened in the slightest degree by the presence of this bodyguard, but Sir P. Loraine placed little faith in these protestations and suggested that the E7956/6/34/ Sheikh should endeavour to secure them in writing. Meanwhile, he was endeavouring to facilitate, so far as he could with discretion, the settlement of the Sheikh’s accounts with the Persian Government. 25. The Persian detachment proceeding from Isfahan was attacked and f 9 g 4,i/b/d ' routed by the Kuhgilu tribe at Shalil in Bakhtiari country and the remnant forced to return to Isfahan. The Persian Government suspected that the Bakhtiari and the Sheikh of Mohammerah were responsible and it was stated m Tehran that His Majesty’s Government were deliberately encouraging the Sheikh of Mohammerah and other southern chiefs to flout the Central Government with the premeditated design of partitioning the country. Reza Khan, however, decided to bide his time, and in a conversation with Sir P. Loraine at the end of E 8684/6/34/ August gave a definite assurance that no action of his would endanger the Anglo- Persian Oil Company’s interests; during this conversation Sir P. Loraine made it plain that, while we had certain friendships with local chiefs, we had never used them against the Central Government or otherwise than in the interests of order and tranquillity. . 26. Sir P. Loraine, in a despatch of the 4th September, 1922, examined the whole question of our relations with the Sheikh in the light of existing circum stances in Persia. The Persian Government now possessed an army with power (always assuming the continued existence of Reza Khan) to break down resistance in the outlying districts, and Sir P. Loraine’s view was that it would be preferable e 10179/457/ to deal with a strong central authority (provided we were reasonably satisfied as regards its chances of stability) rather than with a number of local rulers, this would involve a loosening of our relations with such local rulers; in his opinion, His Majesty’s Government should proceed very carefully for the time being and be as strictly non-partisan as possible; we must not abandon existing friendships but must attempt the delicate task of preparing the ground so as not to fall between two stools in the event of a radical change in the Persian situation. On the following day Sir P. Loraine sent a message to the Sheikh saying that he was satisfied Reza Khan would not take violent action and that he had promised to do nothing to endanger the common interests of Persia and Great Britain, that he (Sir P. Loraine) trusted the Sheikh to remove any grounds for suspicion against himself, and that he believed that there was a sound possibility of a good under standing between the Sheikh and the Minister of War, whom Sir P. Loraine had found trustworthy in his dealings. Lord Curzon informed Sir P. Loraine on the 12th October that he concurred entirely in the general lines of the proposed policy towards the Sheikh and that it could be pursued in reliance upon his (Lord Curzon’s) support. And the Sheikh sent a reply to Sir P. Loraine e 11658/6/34/ expressing his thanks for the latter’s friendly support and promising to use his ^ • best endeavours to achieve the ends for which he was advised to work. With the removal of Zahir-ul-Mulk (Moayyed-ed-Howldh), who had consistently opposed the Sheikh, and the appointment in his place as Governor of Arabistan of Mushar-ed-Dowleh, with whom the Sheikh established good relations, and with 1922 ° /D/ 1 Reza Khan’s expressions of friendly sentiments towards the Sheikh, the eventful e 13478 / 6 / 34 / year 1922 closed, as far as the latter’s affairs were concerned, on a peaceful note; 1922 . but the financial question had not yet been definitely settled and Reza Khan was not the man to forget a rebuff or to abandon his schemes for using the army to effect the centralisation of Government control over the whole of Persia and the Sheikh had little faith in the promises of Reza Khan. Events in 1923. 27. The year 1923 was notable in the Sheikh’s affairs for the extension of the central Government’s influence in the Bakhtiari country, for the apparent settle ment of the Sheikh’s financial dispute and for the measures taken by His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran to bring about good relations between him and Reza Khan and to attempt to dissuade the latter from embarking upon a course of action which would adversely affect British interests in Arabistan. 28. Details of the measures by which Reza Khan broke the power and pres tige of the Bakhtiaris fall outside the scope of this memorandum, but the fact that this was done had an important bearing on the position of the Sheikh of Moham merah as it marked the crumbling of the barrier which had been for so longPersian Gulf Annual Report for 1923, p. 57 (Persia, No. 35). Conf. 12445, §§ 163-166. R 4392/1416/ 34/1923, E4612/77/34/ 1923 E 4392, E 5061, E 6369/1416/ 34/1923. E5731, E7267/ 77/34/1923 interposed between himself and the Central Government; it is true that fhere had been frequent troubles between him and the Bakhtiaris, but they had usually managed to combine in the face of a common danger. The Bakhtiaris were hned for complicity in the attack on the Persian troops at Shalil m the previous year, they were compelled to accept a settlement of their revenue dispute with the Persian Government and in October a body of 250 Persian troops arrived at Shushtar under Colonel Baqir Khan, who began to exercise greater power in Arabistan than the Governor himself. . 29. The revenue dispute was a source of constant anxiety to His Majesty s Legation for the best part of the year, but as a result of their good offices a settle ment was reached in the middle of November. By this settlement the Sheikh was to pay 500,000 tomans in respect of arrears, 100,000 tomans down and the remainder spread over twenty years; a sum of 150,000 tomans was to be paid annually in future by the Sheikh in respect of both direct and indirect taxation, from which a deduction of 20,000 tomans would be allowed to cover the Sheikh s pension and other legitimate taxes. The Sheikh was thus allowel to continue to control indirect revenue, but a financial agent of the Central Government was to ^ remain as inspecting officer for the whole province of Arabistan. T 30. In April, 1923, when the Persian Government were preparing to send a f military force against the Bakhtiaris, Sir P. Loraine spoke to the Shah, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and Reza Khan on the dangers of piovoking the tribes in the south, with possibly harmful effects on both British and Persian interests. The Minister of War was not to be moved from his purpose, however, and Sir P. Loraine reported at the end of the month that there were further indications to confirm that Arabistan was the ulterior objective, in which case Reza Khan would doubtless pursue the same tactics with the Sheikh as he had with the Bakhtiaris; the question of our assurances to the Sheikh would then arise. A few days later Sir P. Loraine telegraphed saying that an immediate decision was required whether we were to support or oppose the extension of the authority of the Central Government throughout the entire country, and, in either case, by what means; to support the Minister of War would mean the almost certain lapse of our local friendships (of which the most important and difficult case was that of the Sheikh of Mohammerah), but by giving such support we might obtain a measure of control over Reza Khan and perhaps some definite assurances as^ regards the Sheikh’s position; on the other hand, to oppose him meant the pros pect of the same local friendships crumbling under visible force, the gradual collapse of our position and influence unless we were prepared to use force, the thwarting of the one chance that had appeared for decades of a stable Persia under Persian control, a period of intense friction with the Persian Government almost certainly leading to a rupture, and, finally, playing into the hands of Russia. Lord Curzon, however, was not to be rushed into formulating a new policy at this juncture and replied to Sir P. Loraine calling attention to what His Majesty’s Government had done to help the Persian Government and to the apparent inability of Reza Khan to appreciate our attitude in his pursuance of an ambition to create a military dictatorship for himself; as regards the Sheikh we were bound to him by special obligations which we had no intention to ignore; Reza Khan must be made to realise that he could not prosecute his centralising policy to a point where it ran directly counter to British interests; in the last resort he was dependent upon His Majesty’s Government—who were alone able^ to afford him that financial support which he required. The Foreign Office also arranged with the Admiralty to hold some of His Majesty’s ships in readiness to proceed to Mohammerah and also up the Karun should it prove necessary to support the Sheikh. 31. On the 31st May Sir P. Loraine had a meeting with the Prime Minister and Reza Khan, who, after expressing a wish for the general improvement of Anglo-Persian relations and repeating assurances as regards British interests, said that far from having any complaints against the Sheikh, they wished and meant to support him; for internal reasons they wished to send 200 men to Shushtar; Reza Khan said that the presence of some troops in Arabistan was vital to his prestige and that if His Majesty’s Government were to veto the pro posal he would have to resign; he gave his word of honour—and promised written assurances—that the troops would not interfere with the Sheikh, but that their orders would be to support him against any who might question his authority; the Prime Minister also promised to telegraph to the Sheikh saying that the Persian Government had no grievances against him and were entirely well disposed; Sir P. Loraine (who took the view that acquiescence in the despatch[32557] c 2 11 of the troops, if accompanied by adequate assurances, was less dangerous than opposition) also requested the Prime Minister to confirm on behalf of his Govern ment the special position of the Sheikh as granted by his firmans. Lord Curzon, while agreeing that the general result of this interview was satisfactory, wished that Reza Khan’s written undertaking to the Sheikh should be countersigned by the Prime Minister, or, alternatively, that the latter should sign a similar document. 32. The Sheikh, himself, on being informed of the proposals, was far from happy, saying that he put no faith in Persian promises, oral or written, and that he would withdraw his objections only if the written assurance of Reza Khan were backed by a written guarantee from His Majesty’s Minister that the number E6019/1416/ of Persian troops would be limited to 200 and not increased after their arrival 34 / 1923 . and that they would not interfere with his recognised rights and jurisdiction. Sir P. Loraine thereupon instructed His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz to explain to the Sheikh that he could not give such assurances, that the Sheikh should be satisfied with those given in 1914 and realise that the best guarantee of all for him was the restoration of friendly relations between Persia and Great Britain and that the British Foreign Secretary considered that the assurances offered by Reza Khan were satisfactory if endorsed by the Persian Prime Minister. To this message the Sheikh replied that, if Sir P. Loraine were satisfied as to the bona fides of the Minister of War and felt that wider political E6156/1416/ considerations so demanded, he was prepared to give way; but if later on events 34 / 1923 . turned out as he (the Sheikh) anticipated, he would look confidently to His Majesty’s Government to redeem the pledge given to him in 1914 and to support him against Persian Government encroachments. 33. Some delay, partly due to the change in government, occurred before the Persian Government sent any assurances to the Sheikh, and in the mean while detachments of troops had been sent to Shushtar and Bebehan. On the 7th October Reza Khan addressed a letter to Sir P. Loraine stating that these troops had been sent with the principal object of maintaining peace and security Eii 660 /i 4 i 6 / and that the local tribes would be supported so long as they fulfilled their duties 34 / 1923 . and obligations to the central Government. The letter went on to say :— “ Especially in connexion with the loyal services of his Excellency Serdar Akdass (Sheikh of Mohammerah) and the appreciation of the Ministry of War which his Excellency will, no doubt, win for himself in the course of his services, with the result that his Excellency may have complete faith and confidence in the friendly attitude and justice of the Government. In order to leave his Excellency no grounds for anxiety, the first instructions given to the officer commanding the departing troops were to be on his guard to prevent people who have local quarrels with his Excellency from abusing the arrival of the troops and turning it to their own evil advantage.” On the same day, the Persian Prime Minister addressed a telegram to the Sheikh in the following terms “Although your Excellency’s services have always attracted attention of Government which has full confidence in you, nevertheless now in order e 10269/1416/ that you may be aware of intentions of Government I hereby declare that 34 / 1923 . Council of Ministers appreciate always your Excellency’s services. As long as your Excellency endeavours to render services to Government latter will have full confidence in you and will never forget your Excellency’s services.” The only comment in the Foreign Office on learning of these two messages was that they were both capable of various interpretations but that they were better than nothing! 34. Sir P. Loraine now sought to effect a genuine rapprochement between Reza Khan and the Sheikh and to endeavour to allay the latter’s fears. He decided to visit the Sheikh and before his departure spoke to Reza Khan, who e 11731/Hie/ said that His Majesty’s Minister could give the Sheikh the most positive 34/1923 assurances of his friendship and regard and of his anxiety to establish a personal understanding with him. 35. Sir P. Loraine visited Ahwaz on the 13th October and had a conversa tion with the Sheikh, who expressed his anxieties as to his future position and e 11731/me/ begged that he should not be lulled into a false sense of security only to be struck 34/1923. down when all the obstacles to the Persian unifying policy had been removed; he could not remain in Arabistan with his prestige diminished and his authority undermined, and would sooner lease or sell his properties and retire to some part of the world where he could be under British protection. Sir P. Loraine, in reply, analysed current British policy in Persia, according to which it was12 C? E 11666/1416/ 34/1923. E263/263/34/ 1924. E 11731/1416/ 34/1923. essential that the friends of the British Government in Persia should be the friends of the Persian Government also, and said that he was convinced that the Minister of War harboured no sinister intentions towards the Sheikh, adding that the sincerity of Reza Khan’s promises could only be proved by time, and that the Sheikh must give him an opportunity of translating his words into action. The Sheikh said that he could put no faith in Persian promises, where upon Sir P. Loraine asked him bluntly whether he expected the British Govern ment to go to w^ar with Persia in order to maintain the Sheikh in his position of semi-independence. The Sheikh protested that he did not wish to be a source of embarrassment to the British Government, but felt compelled to voice his fears; he would loyally carry out any instructions which His Majesty’s Minister might give him, and if he found his authority being undermined he would inform Sir P. Loraine and rely upon him to find a solution. Sir P. Loraine replied that he would at all times do his best to protect the Sheikh and that the continuance of the latter’s existing friendly relations with the Persian Government and especially with Reza Khan provided the best guarantee of his ability to ensure that protection. f 36. At a later interview on the 16th October, the Sheikh showed his T readiness to throw in his lot with Reza Khan, having had a satisfactory interview \ the previous day with Colonel Baqir Khan, the Persian commander at Shushtar. The Sheikh was anxious to have a personal interview with Reza Khan and suggested that he should offer the latter two armoured cars. On his return to Tehran Sir P. Loraine gave Reza Khan on the 22nd October a brief account of what had passed. Reza Khan expressed his readiness to meet the Sheikh and promised to arrange this as soon as possible; he accepted the gift of armoured cars not for himself personally but on behalf of the army and the nation; and he promised to look after the Sheikh’s second son on his arrival at Tehran as a Deputy in the Majlis. The satisfactory settlement of the revenue dispute followed in mid-November and early in December Sir P. Loraine reported that, acting on his advice, the Sheikh had adjusted the agreement to suit the wishes of Reza Khan in regard to the non-deduction by the Sheikh of amounts spent on maintaining armed forces under his own control. The year thus closed with matters about as satisfactory as they could be, given the circumstances, but the Foreign Office had grave doubts whether the existing good relations between the £ Sheikh and Reza Khan (who had assumed the Premiership at the end of October) could long continue. Persian Gulf Administration Report for 1924, p. 50 (Persia 35). The Rebellion of the Sheikh, 1924. 37. No major dispute arose between the Sheikh and the Central Govern ment during the first half of 1924, during which Reza Khan seems to have resorted to a policy of infiltration into the Sheikh’s territories. Thus, the Persian Govern ment announced their intention of sending a Karguzar to Abadan, who was also to act as Deputy Governor; the Adliyeh at Shushtar began to summon Arabs living in the Sheikh’s territories to attend the Court; a salt monopoly was given to an Iraqi subject without the Sheikh’s being consulted; contrary to the arrange ments regarding indirect taxes, a Rais-al-Baladiyeh was appointed for Abadan; steps were taken to assess the value of the Sheikh’s date gardens with a view to further taxation; heads of Persian departments in Ahwaz, at the instigation, it was believed, of the Russian Consul, met constantly and abused the Sheikh and *,£ the Persian commander, Arabistan (now re-named Khuzistan), did his best to foment trouble among the Arab tribes. But at the beginning of the year Reza Khan had other and more important matters in hand. Shortly after the Minister of War had assumed the premiership, the Shah, feeling himself powerless to resist the encroaching influence of his Prime Minister and fearing for his own personal safety, decided to visit Europe and keep out of the way. His absence added strength to the Republican movement, with which Reza Khan’s name became associated, but the movement collapsed at the end of March and Reza Khan’s prestige and influence reached their lowest level; he resigned early in April but quickly resumed the premiership on being invited by the Majlis’to return. It is also worth recording, because it was a matter of concern to Sheikh Khazal, that there had been considerable changes in British official personnel with whom he had had dealings in the past: Sir P. Loraine was absent on leave from Tehran and Mr. Ovey was in charge of the Legation between the 28th March and the 15th November; Sir P. Cox, who had had so many dealings with the Sheikh and who, as High Commissioner at Bagdad, had not been so far removed geographically, had retired in 1923; and Colonel Trevor, the Political Resident who had served continuously in the Persian Gulf since 1912, left Bushire in April 1924. At a farewell interview with the Sheikh early in March, Colonel Trevor13 found him in a depressed state of mind. The Sheikh spoke of his past services to His Majesty’s Government and of how he had followed their advice in meeting the wishes of the Persian Government; he was, however, convinced of the latter’s hostile intentions towards himself, and attributed this primarily to his friendship with the British Government. He wished to know whether the latter would preserve him in his autonomous position, and also, if the Persian Government made a direct attack on him, whether he should resist or submit. Colonel Trevor expressed his inability to answer the first question on his own authority, and as regards the latter, said that he could hardly advise the Sheikh to resist his own Government. In reporting this conversation Colonel Trevor expressed his own firm conviction that Peza Khan was desirous of reducing the power of the Sheikh and raised the question of the 1914 assurances, pointing out that if we were to stand by and watch the Persian Government take progressive steps to reduce the Sheikh’s state of local autonomy, such an attitude would have a deplorable effect locally, and the Sheikh, not without some reason on his side, would think himself badly let down. Mr. Ovey’s comment on this report was to the effect that the Persian Government had done nothing which was not in accordance with the assurances given in the present year and that there did not appear to be any special grounds for the Sheikh’s nervousness; and the view expressed in the Foreign Office was that it was easy to understand the latter’s attitude, but that there was no reason to suppose that His Majesty’s Government would not continue to afford him adequate support by diplomatic means provided he paid his revenues and gave the Persian Government no valid excuse for interference in his territory. 38 1 ‘ ? risis ar0Se early Au &amp; ust ’ Partly due to the hostile attitude of Colonel Baqir Khan (the Persian Commander at Shush tar), but principally to the action of the Persian Government (inspired by their American financial advisers) m informing the Sheikh that his firmans were invalid, having been cancelled by a later firman of 1903. The Sheikh now expressed his determination to resist any further interference, if necessary by force, and commenced taking steps to secure the allegiance of his tribes. Mr. Ovey instructed His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz to inform the Sheikh (a) that he realised the latter’s anxiety, but that he could not believe that the Persian Government could legally proceed to the lengths feared; (6) that he would call the Prime Minister’s attention to the grave issues involved and hoped to prevent any precipitate action • and (r) that if instead of awaiting the results of the support of His Majesty’s Government the Sheikh were to commit any rebellious act, he would be putting himself m the wrong and would prejudice his case with His Majesty’s Govern- J ei fi a l ne d always willing fully to support his just claims. Mr. Ovey added that if the Sheikh thought that the Prime Minister’s position had been shaken by recent political developments he was much mistaken and instructed ^ argument to keep the Sheikh quiet. On the 23rd August the Foreign Office telegraphed to Mr. Ovey informing him of reports MKmoA ° 1 - i £ 0mpany that tile Sheikh was forming an alliance with the Bakhtiari, Kashgai, &amp;c., and was speaking of inviting the Shah ^ r ‘ ° V i ey was instructed (a) to have a further message , the Sheikh to the effect that, while he might rest assured that, under instructions from His Majesty s Government, Mr. Ovey was doing his utmost to induce the Persian Government to accord just consideration to the Sheikh^ recognised rights and interests, he must be reminded that the British assurances ^fra 1 , n e f endent uppn 1 ills lo yalty to the central Government and that he should refrain from any violent action which would be highly prejudicial both to his own and Bntish interests; and (b) to inform the Asian Prime Minister A?

In addition, the Sheikh required a guarantee from His Majesty’s Government against unfriendly acts by Beza Khan in the Future, and asked whether they would sell him arms and ammunition secretly. Colonel Peel added that he anticipated no danger to the pipe-line and that the Sheikh was unlikely to make any move against Persian troops unless he were attacked or reinforcements were sent towards Bebehan. 39. On September 13th Mr. Ovey was requested to instruct the Political Besident to proceed to Mohammerah and hold language to the Sheikh in accordance with the Foreign Office instructions of the 23rd August, and he was also told to convey a message to the Prime Minister (then in Luristan) warning him of the great danger to which he might be exposing South-West Persia. These instructions were followed by others on the 17th September authorising Mr. Ovey to negotiate with Beza Khan with a view to the acceptance of the Sheikh’s conditions (i) and (iv) and as regards (ii) of a compromise that troops should not be reinforced as long as the Sheikh undertook to behave properly. In addi tion, a further message was to be sent to the Sheikh explaining what was being attempted on his behalf, but stating that His Majesty’s Government could not condone his warlike attitude or assist him in any way to defy the Persian Govern ment, and that, unless he abandoned his warlike attitude, they could not hold themselves responsible for the consequences. In the meantime, the Political Besident had interviewed the Sheikh, his second son (Abdul Hamid), the Bakbtiari Amir Mujahid and Colonel Biza Quli Khan (who had replaced Colonel Baqir Khan at Shushtar but who had apparently thrown in his lot with the Sheikh); all declared that no peace with Beza Khan was possible; the Sheikh had telegraphed to the Majlis explaining that his opposition was to Beza Khan personally and that it was hoped to persuade the Shah to return. On September 16th the' Sheikh had also addressed a telegram to the foreign legations in Tehran in the nature of a proclamation against the Prime Minister, who was described as “a usurper and a transgressor of the Persian nation.” The Foreign Office therefore felt it necessary to inform Mr. Ovey that Hisfc Majesty’s Government had no wish to avoid the guarantees to the Sheikh so long as he should maintain an attitude on which they were conditional, but that he would not be justified in looking to them for support were he to kindle a war and suffer defeat. The Foreign Office felt that it was essential that the atti tude of His Majesty’s Government should be clearly understood by the Sheikh, who might be led into the belief by other British contacts (e.g., local repre sentatives of the oil company) that he would have the sympathy of the British Government in his struggle. 40. Beza Khan, from whatever motive, reacted favourably to Mr. Ovey's representations and practically placed himself in the hands of His Majesty’? Government; he undertook to refrain from asking the Majlis to proclaim the Sheikh a rebel and to approve warlike operations; he further undertook to confirm the Sheikh’s firmans, to recapitulate all his previous assurances to the Sheikh, and to guarantee the lives and properties of the Sheikh and his family and also Amir Mujahid. In return, Beza Khan said he must insist on Amir f Mujahid’s exile and the Sheikh’s absence from Persia for three months, during ' which time he would definitely undertake to refrain from any military action or threats; he would also guarantee the Sheikh’s return, provided the latter made a suitable declaration of submission. All these undertakings were neces sarily contingent upon His Majesty’s Government succeeding in restoring the status quo ante in Khuzistan. 41. The Foreign Office considered that Beza Khan was acting with moderation and their only criticism of his attitude was that the proposed insistence on the Sheikh’s temporary departure from Persia might bring about a state of civil war. Mr. Bamsay MacDonald directed that our policy should be to hold ourselves impartial and enjoin peace, adding that we should, of course, lean to the regular authority and impress both sides accordingly. He informed Mr. Ovey on the 22nd September that he, like Lord Curzon, had never opposed Beza Khan’s policy of consolidating power in the hands of the Central Govern ment, as the one wish of His Majesty’s Government was to see a strong and unified Persia; he hoped, however, that Mr. Ovey would be able to persuade Beza Khan to abstain from insisting upon what amounted to the temporary banishment of the Sheikh and instructed him to persuade the latter to abstain from mobilising his forces. The Sheikh, who expressed his confidence in theresult of a struggle with Eeza Khan, proved difhcult, and in an interview with Colonel Peel on tne 30th September, said that if his conditions were not accepted he would regard the British Government as having betrayed him. Further eftorts were made by Mr. Ovey to persuade the Sheikh to adopt a reasonable attitude and these were reinforced in a personal message which Mr. Ramsay MacDonald sent to the Sheikh in the middle of October. This message made it clear that His Majesty’s Government abided fully by the undertakings given to the Sheikh in the past, but that such undertakings were conditional upon the Sheikh’s observing his loyal obligations towards the Persian Government and that, in the regrettable event of hostilities, the Sheikh could expect no sympathy from His Majesty’s Government; Mr. Ramsay MacDonald expressed his confidence that an honourable settlement could be reached through the mediation of His Majesty’s Government, and urged the Sheikh to desist from all military prepara tions and make his peace with the Central Government. 42. The Sheikh’s reply was to the following effect: he desired that His Majesty’s Government should procure for him an honourable settlement, but he could not accept the terms offered by His Majesty’s Legation because he would lose his position in his territories and could no longer maintain peace there, so that his friendship towards the British Government would be worthless to them; the British were holding him back but meanwhile Reza Khan was proceeding with his military preparations; he felt that he had already lost the support of the British Government and suggested that he should either retire from Khuzistan with his whole family (being granted a residence and means of subsistence) or else that he be freed from restraint and allowed to fight Reza Khan, which he felt confident of doing with success; in the latter case, he was equally confident of his ability to protect British lives and property. The best hope of a peaceful settlement now appeared to lie in arranging a meeting between Reza Khan and the Sheikh, and, acting on instructions, Mr. Ovey approached both with the suggestion that they should meet at some place other than Tehran and that Sir P. Loraine should be present at the interview. After persuasion Reza Khan agreed but stipulated that the Sheikh must first send some message of submission and Mr. Ovey then sent a message urging the Sheikh to comply and giving a personal assurance that such a message would be followed by an immediate cessation of military preparations on the part of the Central Govern ment. Matters were also helped on by the abandonment by Reza Khan of his demand that the Sheikh should temporarily leave Persia, but the Sheikh still made difficulties and it became clear that little could be done except play for time until Sir P. Loraine arrived in Persia and exercised his personal influence on both parties; and playing for time became increasingly difficult, particularly as, contrary to promises^ given to Mr. Ovey, Reza Khan continued to move his troops westwards of the line, Bebehan-Zaidun-Bander Dilam. 43. Early in November the Sheikh, influenced no doubt partly by His Majesty’s Government’s clear disapproval of his rebellion and partly by doubts as to the measure of support to be expected from the Bakhtiari and his other supporters, had decided to make his submission to Reza Khan; he expressed his readiness to meet the latter at Bushire provided that the meeting took place under the auspices of Sir P. Loraine and that the latter would give him assurances as to his safety. But Reza Khan was now becoming impatient at the delay, probably because the approach of winter would hamper military operations. Mr. Austen Chamberlain (who had succeeded Mr. Ramsay MacDonald at the Foreign Office) addressed a telegram to Sir P. Loraine on the 11th November .explaining the view of His Majesty’s Government that the Sheikh, although to some extent provoked, had put himself in the wrong by planning rebellion and by insisting on the conditions (ii) and (iii) (see para. 38' above); it was hoped that Sir P. Loraine would be able to show both sides the folly of pushing matters to an extreme; it might be necessary to speak strongly to the Sheikh because Reza Khan could not be expected to ignore the implications of the Sheikh’s telegrams to the Majlis and the foreign legations and to meet the Sheikh without some preliminary expression of the latter’s regret; the Sheikh could, however, be informed that, mindful of his loyal services during the war, His Majesty’s Government were still doing their best to help him out of a difficult predicament. Sir P. Loraine was informed that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to see the Sheikh expelled or unduly humiliated, nor did they wish to prejudice their improved relations with the Persian Government; it was not desired to fetter Sir P. Loraine with detailed instructions, but if he could persuade the Sheikh to make the first move towards reconciliation, it did not seem unlikely that Reza Khan would be found ready to listen to reason.

Loraine met the Sheikh at Ahwaz on the 13th December and persuaded him to address to Reza Khan a telegram of regret and submission, but now Reza Khan made difficulties and was guilty of a number of breaches of faith. The rebellion had collapsed and he wished to drive home his advantage, while at Tehran criticism was being voiced in the Majlis regarding foreign intervention in Persian internal affairs. Reza Khan now demanded the Sheikh’s unconditional surrender instead of, as arranged, sending him a friendly message; Persian troops continued to move beyond the agreed line and Reza Khan expressed his intention of marching to Mohammerah; and he now made difficulties about meeting Sir P. Loraine and the Sheikh at Bushire, stating that this was no longer possible owing to the news of the proposal having leaked out. In addition, there was reason to believe that Moscow had put in a spoke to prevent a satisfactory arrange ment being reached. In view of Reza Khan’s attitude and the failure of our policy of ‘‘biased neutrality,” His Majesty’s Government and Sir P. Loraine now adopted a strong line with the Persian Government and Reza Khan, in the course of whidh the substance of the 1914 assurances to the Sheikh were disclosed to the Persian Government; the attitude of His Majesty’s Government now was. that, by his submission, the Sheikh had put himself in the right, that they attached^ importance to abiding by their obligations to him (although, in view of the/ situation in Egypt following the murder of Sir Lee Stack on the 19th November, they were anxious not to be embroiled in South Persia), that they were still desirous of doing everything in their power to secure a settlement satisfactory to the Persian Government, but that if the latter persisted in attacking the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government reserved to themselves the right to take such measures as they might think fit in pursuance of their assurances to the Sheikh. But the latter was now a sick man and had suffered a moral collapse, and Reza Khan, by taking full advantage of His Majesty’s Government’s desire to avoid complica tions. was master of the situation. Sir P. Loraine expressed doubts whether it would be possible to obtain terms for the Sheikh favourable enough to make it worth his while to remain in Khuzistan, but he eventually arranged for Reza Khan and the Sheikh to meet at Ahwaz on the 6th December. After a preliminary meeting, Sir P. Loraine spoke to the former, explaining the position of His Majesty’s Government and emphasising the scrupulous loyalty of their attitude and their strong desire that the Sheikh’s position should be substantially, maintained. Reza Khan’s reply was reassuring : he wanted to maintain the* Sheikh in effective authority, but must arrange this in such a manner as to disarm his clitic's in Tehran; he did not want a breach with His Majesty’s Government and promised to hold up the advance of Persian troops. The result of the Ahwaz conference seemed to bear out Reza Khan’s promises. He and the Sheikh swore friendship on the Koran; Persian troops were to remain at Shustar till the spring when, except for detachments, they would be withdrawn provided the pacification of Luristan had been completed; as a temporary measure Reza Khan would appoint a governor at Ahwaz, but this governorship would be restored to the Sheikh in the spring and meanwhile the temporary governor would have no power to interfere with the Sheikh’s authority over the Arab tribes; minor points regarding jurisdiction, police, taxation, &amp;c., were reserved for subsequent discussion and all Persian officials, including the military, would have strict orders to work in harmony with the Sheikh and give him any help he might require. Reza Khan assured Sir P. Loraine that he would not allow agitation in Tehran to deflect him from his purpose and that Sir P. Loraine could be free * from anxiety. Sir P. Loraine also reported that Reza Khan realised that the Soviets had been adopting a perfidious attitude throughout in an endeavour to prevent a peaceful settlement and to drive Reza Khan into armed action. The New Attitude of His Majesty's Government, 1925. 45. The immediate crisis was over but matters were by no means finally settled. It was clear, however, that the old regime had come to an end and that Reza Khan, having established a strangle-hold over Khuzistan would be unlikely ever voluntarily to relinquish it. His Majesty’s Government were now in an embarrassing position : the services which the Sheikh had rendered them in the past and general considerations of prestige in Persian Gulf made it undesirable that they should abruptly terminate their assurances to the Sheikh; the safety of the oilfields and of British lives had to be considered; but the assurances were not compatible with the general policy of strengthening the Central Government and the embarrassing position in which His Majesty’s Government found them selves presented the Soviet Government with wonderful opportunities for fishing in troubled waters. During his discussions with Reza Khan at Ahwaz,17 Sir P. Loraine had told him that the most serious danger of friction in South Persia between Great Britain and Persia would arise from friction between the latter and the Sheikh and that he believed that a close understanding between Reza Khan and the Sheikh would directly strengthen the position of Reza Khan and his Government in Tehran—which would be in accordance with the desires of His Majesty’s Government; he went further and stated that he wished all Great Britain’s friends in South Persia to be friends of Tehran and to help their own Government and for the latter to feel that the south was safe, loyal and peaceful, so that, should danger arise from other quarters, the south could be relied on. In replying to Sir P. Loraine’s report on his proceedings, Sir Austen Chamberlain said:— “ I share your view that the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Persia should be to discourage separatist movements likely to weaken the central authority of the Persian Government and am of the opinion that the policy outlined in your despatch of rallying the tribal chieftains of South Persia to the support of the Persian Government is best calculated to improve the relations of His Majesty’s Government with that Government. The chieftains themselves will thus be led to realise that their traditional friendship with His Majesty’s Government is fully compatible with their duty as loyal Persian subjects.” Sir P. Loraine was aiming at a final and honourable discharge of His Majesty’s Government’s obligations to the Sheikh so that our future action on his behalf could be limited to securing, so far as possible without prejudice to our relations with the Persian Government, the observance of Reza Khan’s promises as regards the Sheikh’s future position, while continuing to urge the Sheikh to deal with Reza Khan direct in matters affecting his own position and authority. Given a correct attitude on the part of the Sheikh therefore, everything turned upon the good faith of Reza Khan. The Final Downfall of the Sheikh, 1925. 46. After the Ahwaz meeting, the Sheikh appears to have resigned himself to the new regime and his main concern was now to retain his properties; but he was in an uncomfortable position, because, with his loss of prestige, he had become the target for claims by many whom he had dispossessed while at the height of his power. He informed Reza Khan that he wished to divide his properties among his sons and travel abroad, but Reza Khan asked him not to leave Persia and urged him to proceed to Tehran, where his presence would greatly assist in the regularisation of the position as regards his properties. (Reza Khan may, or may not, at this time have been genuinely desirous of arriving at a satis factory settlement of the Sheikh’s affairs, but it is worthy of note that he subse quently mentioned to Sir P. Loraine the possibility that the Sheikh would retire to Iraq, where his presence would be an embarrassment to the Persian Government; no doubt this consideration played its part in Reza Khan’s anxiety to persuade the Sheikh to visit Tehran.) The Sheikh, in spite of reassuring messages from Reza Khan and of Sir P. Loraine’s advice to comply with Reza Khan’s request, was undoubtedly afraid to proceed to the capital. He spoke to the acting British Consul at Ahwaz on the 18th April about his grievances, main taining that Reza Khan had broken his promises to him and that he could no longer place any faith in his word; the Sheikh had been advised to rest, but if he went to Tehran he would be worried into his grave and doubted whether he would ever be allowed to leave the capital; such a journey would be a further humiliation and he could not go there as a suppliant seeking to regain property which was his legally. He eventually told Mr. Monypenny that, while he would not go himself, he would send a representative to Tehran; but this decision was too late, for on the same day he and his son, Abdul Hamid, were arrested by Reza Khan’s orders and taken to Tehran under escort. 47. Reza Khan sought to justify this new breach of faith as necessitated by the Sheikh’s refusal to proceed to Tehran voluntarily and by the possibility of his taking up residence in Iraq. To put himself right with Sir P. Loraine, he readily agreed to the latter’s suggestion that the Sheikh should receive a welcome on approaching Tehran and should “ arrive honourably and in no way under arrest,” and said that a house was being placed at his disposal at which his real personal friends (though not political agitators) could visit him. Sir P. Loraine’s view was that there were only two alternative methods of dealing with the [32557] d E 649/136/34/ 1925. E2100/136/ 34/1925. E1572/136/ 34/1925. E 2502/136/ 34/1925.

At first, everything promised well as the Sheikh told Sir P. Loraine that he had been treated with the greatest consideration and respect, that Reza Khan had given him a warm and affectionate welcome and had said that political considerations had obliged him to bring the Sheikh to Tehran as an act of authority but that there would shortly be a relaxation. In addition, Reza Khan renewed his promise to Sir P. Loraine to put the Sheikh’s affairs straight, undertaking, if the Sheikh behaved wisely, to rehabilitate his prestige in a public manner; and by the beginning of October Sir P. Loraine was able to report good prospects of a satisfactory settlement on the basis of the payment by the Sheikh of a sum of half a million tomans as his share of the expenses of the Khuzistan campaign of 1924, in return for which his firmans would be ratified and he would be allowed to return with tribal authority and high position (but without the right to have armed forces). 48. Although in certain quarters closely interested in the fate of the Sheikh there was a feeling that he had been “ let down ” by His Majesty’s Government, his arrest and removal to Tehran did not lead to a loss of British prestige to the extent that might have been expected given the key position which he had formerly held and the manner in which that position had been built up with the support of the British Government. As a measure of the interest taken in the event in this country it may be noted that it inspired only one question in Parliament, and that was answered without difficulty and without giving rise to supplementaries. As far as Khuzistan was concerned, apart from a purely local disturbance at the time of the arrest, the event was received with apparent indifference. The Sheikh’s son Abdullah acted as chief of the Muhaisin during his father’s absence (and, incidentally, did so more in his own than in his father’s interests). It is true that at the end of July, 1925 there was a short-lived tribal rising at Mohammerah (for which the Sheikh was in no way responsible), but this was due not so much to sympathy with the Sheikh in detention at Tehran as to other | causes—economic factors, the removal of experienced head-men and the rule of * Persian officials over Arabs, feared new taxation and threatened loss of properties, plus, it was suspected, Soviet intrigues. Subsequent negotiations and the death of the Sheikh. 49. Little object would here be served by a detailed account of the negotia tions between the Persian Government and the Sheikh during the latter ? s last years at Tehran. It will suffice to record that the negotiations were marked not only by more than usual Oriental procrastination but also by gross breaches of faith on the part of the Central Government, who had obviously no intention of carrying out the promises given to the Sheikh and to Sir P. Loraine at the end of 1924 and subsequently and who were obviously merely waiting for the Sheikh to die. His Majesty’s Government continued unofficially to urge the Persian Government to come to a satisfactory settlement and release the Sheikh, but their efforts were unavailing and in the end even the Sheikh himself came to realise that representations by His Majesty’s Legation on his behalf were more likely to do harm than good. After eleven years of detention, Sheikh Khazal died during the night of the 24th-25th May, 1936, having been deprived by the Persian Government of his estates in Khuzistan and without any settlement having been reached regarding the compensation which had been promised to him. In record ing the death of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran said : t£ His epitaph might be what is perhaps the only genuine remark which the local authorities (in the person of Teymourtache in 1930) made about him, that the £ interests of the individual must be sacrificed to the public good.’ ” f K 4817/453/ 234/1935, &amp;c., &amp;c. British relations with the Sheikh in matters outside Persian jurisdiction. 50. His Majesty’s Government, with the recollection of the Sheikh’s services in the past and with their inability to carry out the assurances which they had given him, had the Sheikh very much on their conscience. Consequently, they did their utmost to meet any claims which the Sheikh might have against them in so far as matters lay outside Persian jurisdiction. Thus, in 1935, they and the Government of India jointly made an ecc gratia payment to him of 50,000 rupees in repayment of a loan which he had advanced to the Government of India inE2649/18/93/ 1936. 19 This loan was in respect of the erection of consular premises at Ahwaz, tiie building of which had been commenced but had, after the fall of the Sheikh’ been abandoned owing to certain town-planning schemes. The Sheikh’s title to the land in question was more than doubtful and he had none to the buildings except tor the foundations; and it was not considered that he had any legal claim n v Govei ” t of Indi * His Majesty’s Government in the ru Forei § n Gffice successfully urged that the loan should be regarded as a debt of honour and that it should be repaid on the grounds of His Majesty’s ^rnW^ 11161 ^ s . m °r a J. for doing anything possible for our former p otege, who, m addition to his political fall, was now in grave financial straits. o i \ he ^Payment of the loan m respect of the Ahwaz consular site was i? 1 / l 111110 ^ im Portance although illustrative of His Majesty’s Govern- ment s attitude. Of much greater importance, however, was the question of the “ 8 dat f gardens m Iraq, regarding which assurances had been given in 1914 (see last paragraph of Document No. 6 in the Annex). A detailed account of developments m this highly complicated question would be out of place in the n Ut Very i briefl y th 5 Position was as follows. The assurance to the bheikh was fully implemented during the period when His Majesty’s Government m the Tnited Kingdom were responsible to the League of Nations for the administration of Iraq, but successive Iraqi Governments refused to accept con !f ltm K eilt , m thls assurance (and in a similar one given to tJhe bheikh of Koweit) as binding upon Iraq after the establishment of the indepen- svTtem of tL?t UntlT in 1932 ‘ • T i ^ year tlle Ira ^ i Government altered their IsHhl^k n tl0n U n 0Ii * a f ri ? ultu ral Products by a measure known as the but nrflph Tfn 1 ° f Which taxat 1 1 °n was no longer levied on the land itself cr0p as Wer ? sold or ex P° rt ed.

Mr. Lascelles was therefore told that, in any dealings with Sheikh Chassib, His Majesty’s Legation should act on the assumption that His Majesty’s Govern ment were no longer bound by any assurances in respect of Sheikh Khazal himself or his family; this would not preclude His Majesty’s Legation from using their good offices on behalf of the family when this might appear desirable or expedient, but it should be understood by all concerned that any action taken in this sense would be as a matter of grace and not of obligation. HUGH K. GREY. Foreign Office, October 1946. ANNEX. Texts of British Assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, 1902-14. No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) ^th December, 1902. I write to inform you, my honoured friend, of my return to Tehran from Europe and to enquire after your health. It was a great disappointment to me that I was unable to visit you this spring, but, as you know, I was obliged to go to England instead. I hope, however, that it may be possible for me at no distant date to have the pleasure of making your personal acquaintance. I was very glad to hear from Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar of the satisfactory arrangement concluded between you and the Department of Customs. On general grounds of policy it is very desirable that differences should as far as possible be avoided between the Persian authorities and the Arab tribes under your rule. The relations between the British and Persian Governments are of a friendly character, and the preservation of the integrity and independence of the Persian monarchy has for many years been one of the great objects of British policy in this part of the world. Disturbances of a nature to imperil that object would be a senous evil, and you would gain little and might endanger much by throwing off the sovereignty of the Shah. I am convinced that, under the present circum stances, the Arabs, and yourself as their ruler, have every interest in cultivating good and loyal relations with the Government of Tehran, and that the latter has no desire to oppress you or curtail your authority. For this reason I think you acted wisely m giving up all idea of forcible resistance to the establishment of a custom-house, and m seeking rather to come, as I have from the first urged you to do, to a friendly understanding on the subject with the Customs Administration. HajjiReis-ut-Tuj jar asked me on your behalf to what extent you might rely on the protection of the British Government, and I told him that so long as you behaved to us as you have done m the past, in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of your hereditary rights and customs, and to dissuade the Government of Tehran from any endeavour to dimmish or interfere with them. Hajji Reis thereupon said that you were not afraid of the Persian Government itself, nor of attack by21 neighbouring tribes acting or professing to act under its orders; but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign Power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways: either such a foreign Power might be at war with Persia, and might, as an enemy of the Shah, send ships to attack your district; or such a Power, pretending to be the friend of the Persian Grovernment or to act on its behalf, might attempt, also by means of its ships, to conquer you and the Arabs. I replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely, but if either were to arise we should, I believed, interfere, provided you had acted in accordance with our advice; and our fleet, which is the strongest of any in the Gulf, would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. I stated, however, that I would refer these questions to the Foreign Minister of the British Government, and he has now authorised me to say that we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support. As I have, however, said above, I do not regard the danger—at any rate at present—as a real one. The Persian Government desires, I am sure, as earnestly as you do, the preservation of peace in Arabistan, and the establishment of a custom-house at Mohammerah is, as I assured you last year, a fiscal, not a political, measure. It has already informed me in a friendly spirit of the conditions under which the new arrangement has been made, and the British Government has instructed me to intimate its acquiescence in them. We reserve, of course, our right to object to any further change which we may consider likely, as affecting peace and trade on the Karun, to be detrimental to our interests. I trust that the new arrangement may work smoothly. There will be very likely some small difficulties and friction at first, but I trust to your wisdom and judgment to deal with them prudently and patiently. Our consul has my orders to afford you all help and advice, and you may place every reliance on my friendship. You can write to me freely should you wish to do so, as well as to the Resident at Bushire. ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. No. 2. Sir A . Hardinge to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, %Ath December, 1903. I have received a telegram in reply to the one to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Mohammerah, after my first interview with your Excellency. Lord Lansdowne says that if, as he presumes is the case from my account of your Excellency’s statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repudiate the arrangement made with you last year, I am authorised to say that you are, in his opinion, justified in opposing such attempt. He instructs me to remind you of the message which he sent you last year, and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observe the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself. He has authorised me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting the conditions of the arrangement on their side. I do not propose to do so until I hear further from you, as I think it will be better in the interests of good relations between the Persian authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked until all other means of adjusting matters directly between them and you have been exhausted. Meanwhile, I should be obliged if you would send me to Tehran, through His Majesty’s Resident at Bushire, a copy of the note from M. Naus, promising not to take duty on your personal imports, and any further information on the subject. I have, &amp;c. ARTHUR H. HARDINGE./ 22 No. 3. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) 1st December, 1908. After enquiry after your welfare and congratulations on the satisfactory conclusion of your business with the Arab tribes, I have the honour to inform you that I duly communicated to Government all that passed at the interview which I and our friend Mr. McDouall had with your Excellency on the 7th January last, and also placed before them the statement of Government expenditure subsequently received from you through Mr. McDouall. The reply of His Majesty’s Government reached me through His Majesty’s Legation in September last, but, in view of the importance of the subject and the insecurity of the post, I thought it best to delay addressing you until my return to headquarters. On arrival here I learnt of your own absence in Arabistan, and have since waited for your return to Failieh, I am directed to repeat, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, the assurances given to your Excellency in the letter of His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, dated the 7th December, 1902, which is in your possession, and the terms of which I repeated to you at our interview above referred to, and I am then to add that His Majesty's Government now extend those assurances to your successors. I am further to point out that His Majesty’s Government have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, and to explain that that under taking involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country, and includes the continuance of the state of autonomy which your Excellency at present enjoys. It follows from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity which is recognised by the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention. Trusting to have an opportunity of repeating the foregoing assurances in person at an early date, I am, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Pars, &amp;c. No. 4. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After the usual compliments.) Mohammerah, l§th May, 1909. On the 1st December, 1908, I had the honour, by the direction of His Majesty s Government, to repeat to your Excellency the assurances given you on behalf of Government by his Excellency Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, in his letter of the 7th December, 1902, to your address, and to inform you that the British Government were now prepared to extend those assurances to your successors. I was further directed to explain to you that the British Government had engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and that that undertaking in itself involved the maintenance of the status quo in Persia, and thus included the continuance of the same state of autonomy which your Excel lency at present enjoys. I was then to point out that it followed from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an act of infringement of that Persian integrity which has received recognition in the Anglo-Russian Convention. While expressing your thanks for these amplified assurances, you repre sented that they seemed to you only to safeguard you so long as Persia continued to exist as a sovereign State, and you pressed for a further assurance which would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a sovereign State and the inter vention or occupation by foreign Powers. You also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provided immunity against unwarrantable encroachment on your rights by the absolute government of His Majesty the Shah, or whether it also covered prevention of23 similar action on the part of parliamentary government, in reply to those representations, your Excellency was informed that Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, the British Government were not, properly speaking, able to admit even the possibility of Persia ceasing to be a sovereign State or coming under the occupation of a foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency the assurances already given to your Excellency would become even more binding than before. I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now pre pared to extend the application of those assurances to your “ heirs and successors.” Mr. McDouall and I have informed you that in our opinion the assurances as now extended and expressed, appear to satisfy all your requirements; but you have further requested that the words “heirs and successors ” may be changed and the words “ own successive male descendants ” may be written instead; and you have gone on to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government will be pleased to dispel the last shadow of doubt from your mind regarding their own intentions in the future, by adding after the words “male descendants” as above, the words “ up to a period of 100 years ” (or if it be possible 150 years). I cannot give your Excellency any reply on this point without reference to Government, but I will lose no time in communicating to them your representations. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. No. 5. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) Mohammerah, Ihth October, 1910. I have the honour to intimate personally and in writing that I am authorised to inform your Excellency that whatever change may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself, and are intended to extend to your male descendants so long as you and they shall not have failed to observe your obligations towards the central Government, and shall continue to be acceptable to your tribesmen, to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to them.

With reference to the assurances conveyed to your Excellency in my letter dated the 15th October, 1910 ( = llth Shawwal, 1328), and having regard to the further valued services and co-operation which your Excellency has rendered to the British Government and British interests in Arabistan and the Shatt-el-Arab, I am now authorised to assure your Excellency personally, and do so by this24 /£/ writing, that whatever change may take place in the form of the government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution, both to yourself and to us, in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against any unprovoked attack by a foreign Power, or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself and for your successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and their obligations towards the Persian Government, provided always that the nomination of your successors from among your male descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of, His Majesty’s Government, and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. Vis-a-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy. Further, the date gardens which you now possess on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs, and immune from taxation. P. Z.

British interests in A vabistan at the close of the last century. KHAZAL KHAN succeeded, at the age of 36, to the Sheikhdom of Mohammerah on the murder of his elder brother, Mizal Khan, on the 2nd June, 1897. At that time British policy in Persia was governed, as it has invariably been since, by inter-acting strategic and economic considerations. In the strategic field, the basic consideration was the defence of India, and this involved watching and countering Kussian political and economic thrusts from the north; to this end the British Government pursued a policy of strengthening the weak buffer State while also endeavouring to build up a position in the south so as not to be caught at a disadvantage should that buffer State disintegrate. British defence schemes, based as they were on naval power, made the Persian Gulf a region of great strategic importance to India, and therefore to this country, and it was necessary to watch the activities not only of Russia but also of Germany and Turkey in that region. An essential part of British policy in the Gulf was the establish ment of good relations and the conclusion of treaties with the various Arab rulers, ^ and the Sheikhs of Mohammerah, controlling territory at the head of the Gulf, j thus came very prominently into the general scheme. In the economic field also, although the days of the d’Arcy concession and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had not yet arrived, British and Indian interests were considerable : Mohammerah was a port of call for British India Steam Navigation Company’s vessels, a British Indian post office had been established there, a British firm (Messrs. Lynch) controlled the only non-Persian navigation service on the River Karun (which had been opened to navigation in 1888) and British interests were concerned in various road and railway projects in Arabistan. 2. The Sheikhs of Mohammerah, who were chiefs of the Muhaisin division of the the Chaab Arabs, were nominally Persian subjects, but they enjoyed in Arabistan a large measure of autonomy and semi-independence in the administra tion of their territories. The latter, which derived from hereditary occupation, extended beyond Ahwaz and generally covered almost the whole of southern Arabistan, while, in addition, the Sheikhs had large interests to the west of the Shatt-el-Arab in what was recognised as Turkish territory-—including the allegiance of members of their own tribe engaged in cultivation there. The * British Government had established friendly relations with Sheikh Jabir of of Mohammerah and had supported him after the Anglo-Persian war of 1857, and these relations were continued after the accession of his son Mizal Khan to the sheikhdom in 1881; later, however, owing to his annoyance at the competition of Messrs. Lynch with himself in the carrying trade on the Karun and at actions of the British Vice-Consul at Mohammerah in appealing to Persian authorities against his proceedings, and also owing to his fear of incurring the distrust of the Persian Government, MizaTs relations with the British deteriorated. In 1895, when disaffection towards Mizal became rife among his own tribesmen, Khazal Khan, whose accession to the sheikhdom began to appear probable, assured the British Vice-Consul that his political salvation lay in assisting and not opposing the British and that if. as Sheikh, he should be called upon to choose a policy, it would be one of sincere friendship with the British Government, although political exigencies might dictate concealment of its real nature. Early British assurances to the Sheikh, 1899-1903. 3. On his accession, Sheikh Khazal, guided by his principal adviser, the shrewd and able Hadji Mohamed Ali Behbehani, Rais-et-Tujjar, pursued a policy of strengthening his rule both around Mohammerah and in other districts to which his family had traditional claims and of seeking to establish his position vis-a-vis of the Persian Government. The negotiations with the Central Govern ment at Tehran were in the hands of the Rais-et-Tuj jar and the British Legation assisted with their advice. Eventually, in 1903, the Sheikh received firmans from the Shah which recognised as ‘ ‘ perpetual properties ’ ’ the lands of the Sheikh and his tribes at Mohammerah, Abadan Island, Bahmanshir, Karun, Hindyan, Hehmulla and Fallahiyeh; these firmans stipulated that the Sheikh should pay only the usual annual revenues to the Persian Government and that the latter should have no right to take possession of, or interfere with, the properties (or alternatively, if they should acquire them, should pay a reasonable price to the Sheikh); there was also a stipulation (which became important later m connexion with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession) that the proper ties must not be sold or transferred to foreigners, but there was no ban on their being leased.3 4. On his accession, Sheikh Khazal lost no time in again informing His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah of his friendship for the British Govern ment and of his desire to serve them, and in November, 1898, alarmed at the course of his discussions with the Persian Government, he expressed the wish to be taken secretly under British protection; he did not press for a written assurance, nor did he ask for an alliance against the Persian Government, whom he professed to have served faithfully and whom he would* continue to serve, hut he thought the British Government should not allow his influence to be diminished by the Persian Government. Later he informed the British Resident in the Persian Gulf that he apprehended an early downfall of the Persian monarchy, followed by a general scramble and partition of the kingdom, in which case he was anxious that his lot should be thrown in with the British Government. Acting on instructions from the British Minister at Tehran, the Political Resident informed the Sheikh in May, 1899, to the following effect We could not, of course, undertake to maintain the Sheikh against the Persian Government, nor could we say that, if the latter were to break up, we could guarantee his independence; the British Government did not con template such an contingency; but we regarded him as the most influential person in this part of the world and we intended as far as possible to support him, believing that it was in the interest of the country that he should be strong, if e\ei he wanted our advice we would give it; m return we expected that he would help us in matters of trade, &amp;c.; he could rely upon our goodwill at all times, and upon our help whenever we could give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government. Lorimer’K Gazetteer, Vol I, pp. 1754, et seq. Conf. 10039. „ as a of expressed fears of Russia, the Sheikh pressed lor additional and written assurances, and His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, e Tn*° W • a Russian consular officer was to be appointed in Arabistan (where Russian trade was non-existent), and in view of the possibility that the eikh might turn to the Russians for support, urged that something should be done to instil into the Sheikh real confidence in the strength and resolution Tu ea a J? s 1 t y s Government. In the result, Sir A. Hardinge addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 7th December, 1902 (the text of which is reproduced as document No 1 m the annex), assuring him that we would protect Mohammerah against naval attack by any foreign Power (whatever might be alleged as pretext lor such action) and, also, as long as he remained faithful to the Shah and acted according to our advice, we should continue to give him our good offices and support. Prior to the despatch of this letter, His Majesty’s Minister informed the Grand Vizier orally that he had no wish to call in question the Shah s sovereignty over the Sheikh and his people, which His Majesty’s Govern ment had always recognised; but His Majesty’s Government were determined to support the Sheikh against attempts by Russian agents to intimidate him or to insinuate that they could bring pressure to bear on him owing to the influence which Russia exercised at Tehran. (His Majesty’s Government’s attitude m the matter was subsequently made clear in writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.) &amp; 6. In December, 1903, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran proceeded to the Persian GuH to meet the Viceroy, and on his return journey was visited by Sheikh Khazal at Mohammerah. The Sheikh then complained that the Persian Government were not abiding by their undertakings given in the previous year, both as regards the administration of Customs at Mohammerah and the payment of Customs duties by himself, and that they were attempting graduallv to pare away his authority and destroy the prestige on which it rested He contrasted the measure of support which he obtained from His Majestv’s Govern ment with that accorded by them to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein and asked whether His Majesty’s Government would now give him a definite promise of support m the event of the Persian Government’s repudiating the bargain they had made with him. In the course of this conversation the Sheikh mentioned that the Russians were quite prepared to give him promises of protection and Sir A Hardmge thought it not improbable that, if we withheld our support from him, he might enter into some secret arrangement with them. After consuhf turn with the Foreign Office and the Government of India Sir A Hardino-o addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 24th December 1903 statins latter might rest assured of the support of the British’Sn^&amp; wt he, on his own side, observed the conditions of the arrangement madp wT/wn Persian Government; the text of this letter is reproduced as document NoV^ the annex.

Later in the year, however, the Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the Sheikh was chafing at the difficulties and uncertainty of his relations with, and position under, the Shah’s Government, and was at heart dissatisfied at the limited measure of support which the British Government had been able to promise him. Renewals and Amplification of British Assurances, 1908-10. 7. In the years following the British assurances, Sheikh Khazal appears to have suffered little serious interference from the central Government, who, in their weakness and in the chaotic situation in the country generally, appear to have been content to allow the Sheikh to rule undisturbed over his territories : in fact, the Sheikh actually complained to His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah in October, 1907, that, while the Persian press and the Majlis were attacking him on various counts, he was being left to his own resources in policing the 4 Shatt-el-Arab and suppressing disorders amongst the Persian tribes. He * expressed a similar view to the British Resident in January, 1908, complaining that he was left to defend the frontier against Turkey, and had to meet heavy expenditure which should have been borne by the central Government; (actually, although Turkey was making trouble further north, she had not extended such activities to the Sheikh’s territories). 8. At the meeting with Major (afterwards Sir Percy) Cox in January, 1908, the Sheikh, influenced partly by recent assurances given to the Sheikh of Koweit (with whom he was on terms of close friendship) and by the advent of constitu tional government in Persia, raised again the question of the British assurances, saying that it was vital for him to know what would be the policy of His Majesty’s Government, as far as he was concerned, in the event of {a) the break-up of Persia, or (b) an attempt by the Majlis (as opposed to the former absolute govern ment of the Shah) ‘ ‘ to reduce him to nothing ”; he asked for an assurance in writing which should apply not only to himself but to his heirs, in return for which he offered to bind himself to the British Government in any way considered ^ feasible. In reporting this conversation, the Political Resident expressed the opinion that the Sheikh was primarily sincere in his protestations that his hopes and interests were centred on the British Government, but that he was never theless mainly prompted by the dictates of self-preservation and that, failing satisfaction from us, he might turn to the Germans for support. The Foreign Office todk the view that the Sheikh, by reason of the geographical situation of his possessions and by his considerable local influence, was in a position to hinder, or even prevent, the prosecution of any foreign enterprise in the country watered by the Karun, and that it was very desirable to secure his absolute adherence to British interests in order to ensure that his power might always be exercised in their favour by opposing any schemes which might be distasteful to His Majesty’s Government; they were, therefore, disposed to repeat the previous assurances, applying them to the Sheikh’s successor and amplifying them by a form of words which would include the continuance of the Sheikh’s existing state of autonomy. 9. After consultation with the Government of India, the Political Resident received instructions to address a written assurance to the Sheikh, which he did in a letter of the 1st December, 1908, the text of which is given as document No. 3 in the annex. 10. These renewed and amplified assurances failed to satisfy the Sheikh, who, in March, 1909, complained to the Political Resident that they safeguarded him only as long as Persia remained a sovereign State; he wished the guarantee to be extended in such a manner as to make it effective in the event of Persia’s being occupied by foreign Powers or ceasing to be an independent State as a result of foreign intervention; above all he wanted an assurance to the effect thatj provided he and his heirs and tribesmen continued to show themselves amenable to British advice and faithful to British interests, their possessions would be guaranteed to them. In addition, he asked for advice whether to side with the Royalists or Nationalists, both of which parties had been calling upon him to throw in his lot with them, dedaring that he must inevitably take one side or the other and expressing his fear that, if he came to a decision without our advice, we might withdraw our guarantee on the ground that his decision was unsatisfactory to us. Lastly, he appealed for a loan, saying that, if we could5 K, Conf. 9540, No. 435 Conf. 9552, No. 386. Conf. 9540, No. 479. Conf. 9540, No. 11. Conf. 9552, No. 291. do nothing for him, we must not object to his applying elsewhere; (hints of the establishment of relations with other Powers, were, as has been seen, part of his stock bargaining assets). regards the proposed loan, neither His Majesty’s Government nor + + n ^ nc ^ a were at first anxious themselves to make an advance to the feheikh, who, however, showed his hand by obtaining a loan of £1,000 trom the German firm, Wondkhaus and Company. Details of the subsequent discussions need not here be given, but eventually it was arranged that His Majesty s Government should advance a sum of £10,000, the amount actually ^ Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who, by an agreement signed with the Sheikh on the 16th July, 1909, secured the lease of valuable sites on Abadan island and elsewhere. It may be mentioned also that two months earlier assurances had been obtained from the Sheikh regarding prior British rights in irrigation projects on the Karun and other rivers in his territories. 12. The request of the Sheikh for advice as to the action he should take ms-a vis of the Royalists and Nationalists was met by the recommendation not to involve himself m Persian party politics. As regards the Sheikh’s desire for lurther assurances, the Political Resident had several conversations with the Sheikh, to whom he eventually addressed a letter on the 16th May 1909 (the text of which is reproduced as document No. 4 in the Annex). The new’ assurances were in the following words :— I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place m the form of government in Persia, the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add a ey were now prepared to extend the application of those assurances to your heirs and successors.’ ” -a 3 ' + Sheikh was still not satisfied and in discussions with the Political Itesident stated that he wished the assurances to be made applicable for a period Conf. 9633, of 100 years to his male descendants ” rather than to his “heirs and successors ” No m Tw n ea r 0n f ^ r the r€ 9 uest to extend the assurances to his male descendants was f l eared th 'V hlS Hanzal might seize some favourable opportunitv Ih (K ? a .fl S l OI ‘ hls elde f son ’ s (Chassib’s) assassination and usurp future dItiTh P 01 a Stat6d Peri i° d WaS that he feared that at som e P h British Government might find it necessary to intervene in WAT? i Per l ia and P erha P s fi 1 nd lt; convenient to take over Mohammerah, when t^ tW Se n hlS P™ 16 ^ and revenues—in which case he would like an under taking that he would continue to enjoy his personal revenue and be granted an asylum in India or elsewhere.

The Sheikh expressed is readiness to comply with this advice but wished in return for an assurance , of protection against the Bakhtiari; this, however. His Majesty’s Government No ki ' considered both unnecessary and undesirable. y s uoveiument no. ^i. IS. Later in the year matters were complicated by the action of the Vali of Basra, who, because of alleged actions of the Sheikh’s followers in Turkish territory and of the Sheikh’s refusal to surrender one of his tribal chiefs (of Persian nationality), sent a gun-boat which shelled one of the Sheikh’s villaees nLf to T raG 1 Ar de Sha t tt ^ bArab ' Tb e Sheikh, who expressed his reali- No m ’ ness to raise his whole territory against the Turks, was, however preuared to be guided by His Majesty’s Government in this matter, and the latter found themselves m a position of having to implement their assurances against attack from a foreign Power. While holding a warship in readiness to proceed to Mohammerah if necessary, they found it possible to safeguard the Sheikh’s position without resorting to hostilities; it was, however, deemed desirable to counteract a certain amount of loss of prestige suffered by the Sheikh and also to make a demonstration in face of the growth of Turkish ambitions in the6 Conf. 9878, No. 272. Conf. 9878, No. 416. Conf. 11794.* Persian Gulf area, and, having satisfied themselves that the fault in the inci dent had lain with the Turkish Vali and that Sheikh Khazal had subsequently acted correctly and in accordance with British advice, it was arranged that the Political Resident should proceed to Mohammerah in a warship, present the Sheikh with the insignia of the K.C.I.E., and convey to him the revised assurances on which His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India had agreed. 16. The presentation of the insignia took place with due ceremony at the Sheikh’s palace at Eailiyah on the 15th October, 1910. In his speech the Political Resident referred to His Majesty’s Government’s good-will and esteem and to their appreciation of the Sheikh’s sustained efforts to preserve order and security for trade in the districts under his control. In his reply, the Sheikh spoke of the friendship between the Persian and British Governments and of his hopes that he might be able to render service and devotion to the former and to earn the approval of the latter. As regards the assurances, the Political Resi dent addressed a letter to the Sheikh on the 15th October, the text of which is reproduced as document No. 5 in the Annex, and also another in identic terms (except for the omission of the words “to be acceptable to your tribesmen”) which the Sheikh could show, if necessary, to the headmen of the tribes under his control. The written assurances were accompanied by an important oral statement by the Political Resident, in the presence of His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah and the Rais-et-Tujjar, to the effect that the Sheikh must under stand that circumstances might arise in which it would be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to intervene by force on his behalf. The Sheikh replied that he quite understood this and that it was sufficient for him to know that His Majesty’s Government really meant to safeguard him to the best of their ability in case of emergency. Thus ended a long chapter, to which need be added only the fact that in the following December the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to His Majesty’s Minister on the subject of the Sheikh, saying that information had been received that the latter was under British protection; to this Sir G. Barclay replied that the Sheikh was not a British protected person but that His Majesty’s Government had special relations with him, and that, in the event of any encroachment on his rights, he would receive their support; the text of the assurances were not, however, communicated to the Persian Government. t &lt; The Assurances of 191 A. 17. In December, 1913 (at a time when His Majesty’s Government were contemplating the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), the Sheikh asked Sir Percy Cox for further assurances on the following lines :— {a) that we should make the position regarding the succession more secure by a modification of the existing assurances; (5) that we would take cognisance of a definite peace compact between the Sheikh and the Bakhtians which would render him immune from the necessity and expense of protecting his territory against their aggression; and (c) that we should endeavour to devise and take measures with the Persian Government to secure to him the status of local autonomy to which the history of the past entitled him and Which he was then enjoying in practice, although on a precarious basis. These matters were still under discussion by His Majesty’s Government when the outbreak of war in 1914 transformed the' situation; the disintegration of Persia and the encroachment of Russia, which had previously been the main pre occupation of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, were eclipsed by the more immediate menace from Germany and Turkey, and it was regarded as clearly essential that we should reaffirm and strengthen our assurances to the Sheikh, who, there was reason to believe, was ready to act in collusion with the Sheikh of Koweit, with Ibn Sand and with certain notables of Basra, in preparing the way for a peaceful British occupation of that port. The Government of India now recommended that the former assurances should be reaffirmed and strengthened and that, in addition, we should undertake to maintain the Sheikh in secure and untaxed possession of his date gardens on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab. 18. On the 3rd November, 1914 (i.e., before the formal announcement by His Majesty’s Government on the 5th November that a state of war existed with Turkey but at a time when hostilities had actually commenced), Colonel Knox/ the acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, addressed a letter to the Sheikh containing the revised assurances. The text of this letter need not be reproduced here because it mentioned the co-operation to be expected from the Sheikh in the capture of Basra, and, as the question of such co-operation did not actually arise, the Sheikh, after the capture of Basra, asked for a revised letter from which the passages relating thereto should be omitted. Sir P. Cox therefore addressed to him a new letter bearing the date the 22nd November, 1914 (i.e., that on which Basra was occupied by British forces), which became the master document, the text of which is reproduced as document No. 6 in the annex. The War Period. 19. It may be recorded briefly that the Sheikh was of positive assistance to His Majesty’s Government during the war, largely by his maintenance of order in that part of Persia where British interests were so considerable. This was particu larly the case in 1915 when certain unruly tribes under his jurisdiction, incited by the preaching of a jehad by Turkish agents, rose in revolt and assisted the Turks in an attack on British troops at Ahwaz and in cutting the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s pipe line; on that occasion the Sheikh did much to facilitate the rapid restitution of order as soon as the Turks had been driven back. Towards the end of 1915, when it appeared probable for a time that Persia would intervene in the war on the side of the enemy, there was some discussion of recognising the Sheikh’s independence in that event, but, as the emergency never in fact occurred, Sir P. Cox’s letter of the 22nd November, 1914, remained the final embodiment of His Majesty’s Government’s commitments to the Sheikh. The Post-War Period, 1919-20. 20. The end of hostilities in Europe and in the Ottoman Empire brought little improvement in the state of Persia, which continued to exercise His Majesty’s Government. The danger from Germany and Turkey was now removed but that from Russia was revived in a new form—Bolshevism. The Sheikh’s territories, by contrast, remained generally quiet, to the benefit of British interests which had grown enormously. Although order was maintained in the Sheikh’s territories, this was achieved only by autocratic and oppressive rule and the Sheikh was no longer a popular ruler. He maintained his control of the tribes by a policy of breaking the power of any sheikh or tribe likely to become too strong and a danger to his rule, replacing the suspected leaders by agents of his own selection who governed the tribes and collected revenue from them; in the process, incidentally, he acquired personal possession of much property. He now feared for his life, and Chassib Khan, his eldest son, whom he had appointed as Governor of Mohammerah in 1919, came under suspicion, as a result of which he was removed from his post in 1921 and thenceforward carefully watched. Khazal continued to enjoy the support of His Majesty’s Government, who, however, had not, in his opinion, sufficiently rewarded him for his past services. (In particular, he was disappointed that Feisal ibn Hussein had been chosen as King of Iraq rather than himself.) The rise of Reza Khan. 21. The beginning of the decline of the Sheikh’s power coincided with, and was a direct result of, the rise of Reza Khan, who was ultimately personally responsible for the Sheikh’s complete downfall. General Reza Khan arrived at Tehran with his force of Cossacks in February, 1921, took control of the capital and from that time, until he became Prime Minister himself in October, 1923, was, as Minister of War, the main force in Persian politics His immediate policy was to bring the country under the control of the Central Government, and for this purpose he organised military formations in the distant parts which had hitherto been largely outside the control of the Government; at first, however, he found it politic to leave the Sheikh’s territories alone. Financial dispute between the Sheikh and the Persian Government. 22. Prior to the advent of Reza Khan, the Central Government had been showing resentment at the prosperity of Arabistan from which they were deriving no direct financial benefit owing to {a) the non-payment by the Sheikh of his annual revenue (maliyat), and (b) the appropriation to himself by the Sheikh of all indirect taxation. It is unnecessary here to enter into details of the Goaf. 13055-*. Conf. 11794.* Conf. 13055,* p. 222. Ditto, p. 220.8 Conf. 12004, No. 175. E2003/2003/ 34/1922. E3121/6/34/ 1922. E4348/6/34/ 1922.

E7260/6/34/ 1922. early negotiations between the Sheikh and the Central Government, but the position at the end of 1921 was briefly as follows :— The Sheikh had paid no maliyat since 1913 but, on the other hand, was claiming from the Persian Government sums which he had expended during the war in maintaining law and order in Arabistan without any assistance from the Persian Government. After prolonged negotiations, in which His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran had lent support to the Sheikh, Vossugh- ed-Dowleh had agreed to waive the payment of maliyat for the war period and to accept a moiety for six years as from 1920. Unfortunately, matters were not put on a formal basis and the Sheikh was not fully satisfied and refused to continue payment. Qawam-es-Sultaneh stated that neither his Government nor the Majlis would accept the settlement to which Vossugh-ed- Dowleh had agreed, but had offered to waive the war-time revenues in exchange for the payment in full as from 1920. To this, however, the Sheikh would not agree unless arrangements were made by which the Persian Government would meet part of the recurring expenditure in maintaining law and order in Southern Arabistan, and when, early in 1922, proposals to this effect were advanced, he would accept no compromise in spite of $ advice from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, who regarded the proposed terms as reasonable. 23. Matters took a new turn in April, 1922, when it was learned that the Persian Government proposed to send troops into Arabistan to compel the Sheikh to pay his revenue. The Sheikh now asked for British intervention, appealing to the assurances given to him and declaring that the despatch of a small force to Arabistan would lead to unrest and anarchy, with consequent loss to British commercial interests. On learning of this, Sir P. Loraine requested the Political Resident to see the Sheikh and speak to him seriously : the Sheikh had only himself to blame, and while the British obligations to him were fully recognised, they were clearly not intended to protect him from discharging hm obligations to the Persian Government; the undesirability of the despatch of Persian troops to Arabistan from the British point was also fully realised, but the Minister of War (who was responsible) was an opponent of the Bolsheviks and might therefore prove an asset to His Majesty’s Government, and Sir P. Loraine did^ not wish to take up a bad case with him; the first essential was, therefore, that the Sheikh should come to a reasonable settlement with the Persian Government. The Political Resident, being unable himself to see the Sheikh, instructed His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz to impress upon the Sheikh that, if he desired British support in accordance with the 1914 assurances, he must fulfil his obligations to the Persian Government, among the first of which was the payment of revenue. This produced what appeared to be a satisfactory settlement, the Sheikh promising to pay two years’ arrears of revenue on being released from payments during the war. The matter was not, however, finally settled as the actual amount of the arrears had not been fixed, but early in June Sir P. Loraine thought that the matter could be settled without his intervention and did not think that the despatch of troops to Arabistan was likely to materialise. The despatch of Persian troops to Arabistan, 1922. 24. On the 18th July, 1922, Sir P. Loraine received information that the Persian Government had despatched a force of 500 men for Arabistan and at once caused representations to be made to the Minister of War and Prime Minister, calling attention to the possible resultant dangers to Britisih interests. The Prime Minister said that on grounds of prestige he could not recall the troops (which were merely to form a bodyguard for the Governor at Shushtar) but expressed his and Reza Khan’s readiness to give formal assurances to the Sheikh that the troops would not interfere with the Sheikh’s territory or the Arab tribes. On the same day Sir P. Loraine sent for two leading Bakhtiari Khans, explaining the situation and the action taken; it was agreed that the interests of the Bakhtiari, the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government were identical in this matter and that the Bakhtiaris and the Sheikh should support the representations of His Majesty’s Legation; the Khans proposed force, but Sir P. Loraine said that this must be absolutely the last resort and ought not to be necessary. The Foreign Office were somewhat disturbed by the report of this interview and made it clear to Sir P. Loraine that His Majesty’s Government must not be committed to embarrassing obligations towards the Bakhtiaris; Sir P. Loraine was instructed to employ all his efforts to induce the Persian Government to abandon any inten tion as regards Southern Arabistan, but was informed that there seemed to belittle reason to object to the ‘‘bodyguard” proposal outside the Sheikh’s territories. Matters appeared to be fairly satisfactory when the Prime Minister assured Sir P. Loraine on the 24th July that neither the Sheikh nor his interests nor those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would be interfered with or threatened in the slightest degree by the presence of this bodyguard, but oi, 1 * -i i ^ j0ra ^ ne pl ace d little faith in these protestations and suggested that the Sheikh should endeavour to secure them in writing. Meanwhile, he was endeavouring to facilitate, so far as he could with discretion, the settlement of the Sheikh’s accounts with the Persian Government. E7398/6/34/ 1922. E7956/6/34/ 1922. 25. The Persian detachment proceeding from Isfahan was attacked and e8043/6/34/ routed by the Kuhgilu tribe at Shalil in Bakhtiari country and the remnant 1922 forced to return to Isfahan. The Persian Government suspected that the Bakhtiari and the Sheikh of Mohammerah were responsible and it was stated in Tehran that His Majesty’s Government were deliberately encouraging the Sheikh of Mohammerah and other southern chiefs to flout the Central Government with the piemeditated design of partitioning the country. Reza Khan, however, decided to bide his time, and in a conversation with Sir P. Loraine at the end of e 8684 / 6 / 34 / August gave a definite assurance that no action of his would endanger the Anglo- 1922 - Persian Oil Company’s interests; during this conversation Sir P. Loraine made it plain that, while we had certain friendships with local chiefs, we had never used them against the Central Government or otherwise than in the interests of order and tranquillity. 26. Sir P. Loraine, in a despatch of the 4th September, 1922, examined the whole question of our relations with the Sheikh in the light of existing circum stances in Persia. The Persian Government now possessed an army with power (always assuming the continued existence of Reza Khan) to break down resistance m j districts, and Sir P. Loraine’s view was that it would be preferable E 10179 / 457 / to deal with a strong central authority (provided we were reasonably satisfied 34 Z 1922 - as regards its chances of stability) rather than with a number of local rulers; this would involve a loosening of our relations with such local rulers; in his opinion, His Majesty’s Government should proceed very carefully for the time being and be as strictly non-partisan as possible; we must not abandon existing friendships but must attempt the delicate task of preparing the ground so as not to fall between two stools in the event of a radical change in the Persian situation. On the following day Sir P. Loraine sent a message to the Sheikh saying that he was satisfied Reza Khan would not take violent action and that he had promised to do nothing to endanger the common interests of Persia and Great Britain, that he (Sir P. Loraine) trusted the Sheikh to remove any grounds for suspicion against himself, and that he believed that there was a sound possibility of a good under standing between the Sheikh and the Minister of War, whom Sir P. Loraine had found trustworthy in his dealings. Lord Curzon informed Sir P. Loraine on the 12th October that he concurred entirely in the general lines of the proposed policy towai ds the Sheikh and that it could be pursued m reliance upon his (Lord Curzon s) support. And the Sheikh sent a reply to Sir P. Loraine e 11658/6/34/ expressing his thanks for the latter’s friendly support and promising to use his 1922 - best endeavours to achieve the ends for which he was advised to work. With the r ® mo y al . 1 °{ Zahir-ul-Mulk (Moayyed-ed-Dowleh), who had consistently opposed the Sheikh, and the appointment m his place as Governor of Arabistan of Mushar-ed-Dowleh, with whom the Sheikh established good relations and with E131 64/6/34/ Reza Khan’s expressions of friendly sentiments towards the Sheikh the eventful !? 22 ' year 1922 closed, as far as the latter’s affairs were concerned, on a peaceful note- i 922 478/6/34/ but the financial question had not yet been definitely settled and Reza Khan was not the man to forget a rebuff or to abandon his schemes for using the army to effect the centralisation of Government control over the whole of Persia and the Sheikh had little faith in the promises of Reza Khan. Events in 1923. 27. The year 1923 was notable in the Sheikh’s affairs for the extension of the central Government’s influence in the Bakhtiari country, for the apparent settle ment of the Sheikh’s financial dispute and for the measures taken by His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran to bring about good relations between him and Reza Khan and to attempt to dissuade the latter from embarking upon a course of action which would adversely affect British interests in Arabistan. 28. Details of the measures by which Reza Khan broke the power and pres tige of the Bakhtiaris fall outside the scope of this memorandum, but the fact that this was done had an important bearing on the position of the Sheikh of Moham merah as it marked the crumbling of the barrier which had been for so lorn? [32557] c10 Persian Gulf Annual Report for 1923, p. 57 (Persia, No. 35). Conf. 12445, §§ 163-166. E 4392/1416/ 34/1923. E 4612/77/34/ 1923. B 4392, E 5061, E 6369/1416/ 34/1923. E5731, E7267/ 77/34/1923 interposed between himself and the Central Government; it is true that tliere had been frequent troubles between him and the Bakhtiaris, but they had usually managed to combine in the face of a common danger. I he Bakhtiaris were fined for complicity in the attack on the Persian troops at bhalil in the previous year, they were compelled to accept a settlement of their revenue dispute with the Persian Government and in October a body of 250 Persian troops arrived at Shushtar under Colonel Baqir Khan, who began to exercise greater powei m Arabistan than the Governor himself. . 29. The revenue dispute w~as a source of constant anxiety to His Majesty s Legation for the best part of the year, but as a result of their good offices a settle ment was reached in the middle of November. By this settlement the Sheikh was to pay 500,000 tomans in respect of arrears, 100,000 tomans down and the remainder spread over twenty years; a sum of 150,000 tomans was to be paid annually in future by the Sheikh in respect of both direct and indirect taxation, from which a deduction of 20,000 tomans would be allowed to cover the Sheikh s pension and other legitimate taxes. The Sheikh was thus allowel to continue to control indirect revenue, but a financial agent of the Central Government was to remain as inspecting officer for the whole province of Arabistan. ^ 30. In April, 1923, when the Persian Government were preparing to send a * military force against the Bakhtiaris, Sir P. Loraine spoke to the Shah, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and Reza Khan on the dangers of provoking the tribes in the south, with possibly harmful effects on both British and Persian interests. The Minister of War was not to be moved from his purpose, however, and Sir P. Loraine reported at the end of the month that there were further indications to confirm that Arabistan was the ulterior objective, in which case Reza Khan would doubtless pursue the same tactics with the Sheikh as he had with the Bakhtiaris; the question of our assurances to the Sheikh would then arise. A few days later Sir P. Loraine telegraphed saying that an immediate decision was required whether we were to support or oppose the extension of the authority of the Central Government throughout the entire country, and, in either case, by what means; to support the Minister of War would mean the almost certain lapse of our local friendships (of which the most important and difficult case was that of the Sheikh of Mohammerah), but by giving such support we might obtain a measure of control over Reza Khan and perhaps some definite assurances as # regards the Sheikh’s position ; on the other hand, to oppose him meant the pros pect of the same local friendships crumbling under visible force, the gradual collapse of our position and influence unless we were prepared to use force, the thwarting of the one chance that had appeared for decades of a stable Persia under Persian control, a period of intense friction with the Persian Government almost certainly leading to a rupture, and, finally, playing into the hands of Russia. Lord Curzon, however, was not to be rushed into formulating a new policy at this juncture and replied to Sir P. Loraine calling attention to what His Majesty’s Government had done to help the Persian Government and to the apparent inability of Reza Khan to appreciate our attitude in his pursuance of an ambition to create a military dictatorship for himself; as regards the Sheikh we were bound to him by special obligations which we had no intention to ignore ; Reza Khan must be made to realise that he could not prosecute his centralising policy to a point where it ran directly counter to British interests; in the last resort he was dependent upon His Majesty’s Government—who were alone able to afford him that financial support which he required. The Foreign Office also arranged with the Admiralty to hold some of His Majesty’s ships in readiness to proceed to Mohammerah and also up the Karun should it prove necessary to support the Sheikh. 31. On the 31st May Sir P. Loraine had a meeting with the Prime Minister and Reza Khan, who, after expressing a wish for the general improvement of Anglo-Persian relations and repeating assurances as regards British interests, said that far from having any complaints against the Sheikh, they wished and meant to support him; for internal reasons they wished to send 200 men to Shushtar; Reza Khan said that the presence of some troops in Arabistan was vital to his prestige and that if His Majesty’s Government were to veto the pro posal he would have to resign; he gave his word of honour—and promised written assurances—that the troops would not interfere with the Sheikh, but that their orders would be to support him against any who might question his authority; the Prime Minister also promised to telegraph to the Sheikh saying that the Persian Government had no grievances against him and were entirely well disposed; Sir P. Loraine (who took the view that acquiescence in the despatch11 of the troops, if accompanied by adequate assurances, was less dangerous than opposition) also requested the Prime Minister to confirm on behalf of his Govern ment the special position of the Sheikh as granted by his firmans. Lord Curzon, while agreeing that the general result of this interview was satisfactory, wished that Reza Khan’s written undertaking to the Sheikh should be countersigned by the Prime Minister, or, alternatively, that the latter should sign a similar document. 32. The Sheikh, himself, on being informed of the proposals, was tar trom happy, saying that he put no faith in Persian promises, oral or written, and that he would withdraw his objections only if the written assurance of Reza Khan were backed by a written guarantee from His Majesty’s Minister that the number of Persian troops would be limited to 200 and not increased after their arrival and that they would not interfere with his recognised rights and jurisdiction. Sir P. Loraine thereupon instructed His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz to explain to the Sheikh that he could not give such assurances, that the Sheikh should be satisfied with those given in 1914 and realise that the best guarantee of all for him was the restoration of friendly relations between Persia and Great Britain and that the British Foreign Secretary considered that the assurances offered by Reza Khan were satisfactory if endorsed by the Persian Prime Minister. To this message the Sheikh replied that, if Sir P. Loraine were satisfied as to the bona fides of the Minister of War and felt that wider political considerations so demanded, he was prepared to give way; but if later on events turned out as he (the Sheikh) anticipated, he would look confidently to His Majesty’s Government to redeem the pledge given to him in 1914 and to support him against Persian Government encroachments. 33. Some delay, partly due to the change in government, occurred before the Persian Government sent any assurances to the Sheikh, and in the mean while detachments of troops had been sent to Shushtar and Bebehan. On the 7th October Reza Khan addressed a letter to Sir P. Loraine stating that these troops had been sent with the principal object of maintaining peace and security and that the local tribes would be supported so long as they fulfilled their duties and obligations to the central Government. The letter went on to say :— “Especially in connexion with the loyal services of his Excellency Serdar Akdass (Sheikh of Mohammerah) and the appreciation of the Ministry of Wdr which his Excellency will, no doubt, win for himself in the course of his services, with the result‘that his Excellency may have complete faith and confidence in the friendly attitude and justice of the Government. In order to leave his Excellency no grounds for anxiety, the first instructions given to the officer commanding the departing troops were to be on his guard to prevent people who have local quarrels with his Excellency from abusing the arrival of the troops and turning it to their own evil advantage.” On the same day, the Persian Prime Minister addressed a telegram to the Sheikh in the following terms “Although your Excellency’s services have always attracted attention of Government which has full confidence in you, nevertheless now in order that you may be aware of intentions of Government I hereby declare that Council of Ministers appreciate always your Excellency’s services. As long as your Excellency endeavours to render services to Government latter will have full confidence in you and will never forget your Excellency’s services.” The only comment in the Foreign Office on learning of these two messages was that they were both capable of various interpretations but that they were better than nothing! 34. Sir P. Loraine now sought to effect a genuine rapprochement between Reza Khan and the Sheikh and to endeavour to allay the latter’s fears. He decided to visit the Sheikh and before his departure spoke to Reza Khan, who said that His Majesty’s Minister could give the Sheikh the most positive assurances of his friendship and regard and of his anxiety to establish a personal understanding with him. 35. Sir P. Loraine visited Ahwaz on the 13th October and had a conversa tion with the Sheikh, who expressed his anxieties as to his future position and begged that he should not be lulled into a false sense of security only to be struck down when all the obstacles to the Persian unifying policy had been removed; he could not remain in Arabistan with his prestige diminished and his authority undermined, and would sooner lease or sell his properties and retire to some part of the world where he could be under British protection. Sir P. Loraine, in reply analysed current British policy in Persia, according to which it was [32557] c 2 E 6019/1416/ 34/1923. E 6156/1416/ 34/1923. E11560/1416/ 34/1923. E 10269/1416/ 34/1923.

The Sheikh said that he could put no faith in Persian promises, where upon Sir P. Loraine asked him bluntly whether he expected the British Govern ment to go to war with Persia in order to maintain the Sheikh in his position of semi-independence. The Sheikh protested that he did not wish to be a source of embarrassment to the British Government, but felt compelled to voice his fears; he would loyally carry out any instructions which His Majesty’s Minister might give him, and if he found his authority being undermined he would inform Sir P. Loraine and rely upon him to find a solution. Sir P. Loraine replied that he would at all times do his best to protect the Sheikh and that the continuance of the latter’s existing friendly relations with the Persian Government and especially with Reza Khan provided the best guarantee of his ability to ensure that protection. 36. At a later interview on the 16th October, the Sheikh showed his / readiness to throw in his lot with Reza Khan, having had a satisfactory interview the previous day with Colonel Baqir Khan, the Persian commander at Shushtar. The Sheikh was anxious to have a personal interview with Reza Khan and suggested that he should offer the latter two armoured cars. On his return to Tehran Sir P. Loraine gave Reza Khan on the 22nd October a brief account of what had passed. Reza Khan expressed his readiness to meet the Sheikh and promised to arrange this as soon as possible; he accepted the gift of armoured cars not for himself personally but on behalf of the army and the nation; and he promised to look after the Sheikh’s second son on his arrival at Tehran as a Deputy in the Majlis. The satisfactory settlement of the revenue dispute followed in mid-November and early in December Sir P. Loraine reported that, acting on his advice, the Sheikh had adjusted the agreement to suit the wishes of Reza Khan in regard to the non-deduction by the Sheikh of amounts spent on maintaining armed forces under his own control. The year thus closed with matters about as satisfactory as they could be, given the circumstances, but the r Foreign Office had grave doubts whether the existing good relations between the Sheikh and Reza Khan (who had assumed the Premiership at the end of October) could long continue. The Rehellion of the Sheikh, 1924. 37. No major dispute arose between the Sheikh and the Central Govern ment during the first half of 1924, during which Reza Khan seems to have resorted to a policy of infiltration into the Sheikh’s territories. Thus, the Persian Govern ment announced their intention of sending a Karguzar to Abadan, who was also to act as Deputy Governor; the Adliyeh at Shushtar began to summon Arabs living in the Sheikh’s territories to attend the Court; a salt monopoly was given to an Iraqi subject without the Sheikh s being consulted; contrary to the arrange ments regarding indirect taxes, a Rais-al-Baladiyeh was appointed for Abadan; steps were taken to assess the value of the Sheikh’s date gardens with a view to further taxation; heads of Persian departments in Ahwaz, at the instigation, it was believed, of the Russian Consul, met constantly and abused the Sheikh and the Persian commander, Arabistan (now re-named'Khuzistan), did his best to foment trouble among the Arab tribes. But at the beginning of the year Reza Khan had other and more important matters in hand. Shortly after the Minister of War had assumed the premiership, the Shah, feeling himself powerless to resist the encroaching influence of his Prime Minister and fearing for his own personal safety, decided to visit Europe and keep out of the way. His absence added strength to the Republican movement, with which Reza Khan’s name became associated, but the movement collapsed at the end of March and Reza Khan’s prestige and influence reached their lowest level; he resigned early in April but quickly resumed the premiership on being invited by the Majlis to return It is also worth recording, because it was a matter of concern to Sheikh Khazal that there had been considerable changes in British official personnel with whom he had had dealings m the past: Sir P. Loraine was absent on leave from Tehran i Si m ° V K y W c ® ^ € i arge j between the 28th March and the 15th November; Sir P. Cox, who had had so many dealings with the Sheikh and who, as High Commissioner at Bagdad, had not been so far removed gepgraphmaUy had retired m 1923; and Colonel Trevor, the Political Resident yno°, had A Serve , d cont inuously in the Persian Gulf since 1912, left Bushire in Aoril 1924. At a farewell interview with the Sheikh early in March, Colonel Trevor13 found him in a depressed state of mind. The Sheikh spoke of his past services to His Majesty’s Government and of how he had followed their advice in meeting the wishes of the Persian Government; he was, however, convinced of the latter’s hostile intentions towards himself, and attributed this primarily to his friendship with the British Government. He wished to know whether the latter would preserve him in his autonomous position, and also, if the Persian Government made a direct attack on him, whether he should resist or submit. Colonel Trevor expressed his inability to answer the first question on his own authority, and as regards the latter, said that he could hardly advise the Sheikh to resist his own Government. In reporting this conversation Colonel Trevor expressed his own firm conviction that Reza Khan was desirous of reducing the power of the Sheikh and raised the question of the 1914 assurances, pointing out that if we were to stand by and watch the Persian Government take progressive steps to reduce the Sheikh’s state of local autonomy, such an attitude would have a deplorable effect locally, and the Sheikh, not without some reason on his side, would think himself badly let down. Mr. Ovey’s comment on this report was to the effect that the Persian Government had done nothing which was not in accordance with the assurances given in the present year and that there did not appear to be any special grounds for the Sheikh’s nervousness; and the view expressed in the Foreign Office was that it was easy to understand the latter’s attitude, but that there was no reason to suppose that His Majesty’s Government would not continue to afford him adequate support by diplomatic means provided he paid his revenues and gave the Persian Government no valid excuse for interference in his territory. 38. A crisis arose early in August, partly due to the hostile attitude of Colonel Baqir Khan (the Persian Commander at Shush tar), but principally to the action of the Persian Government (inspired by their American financial advisers) m informing the Sheikh that his firmans were invalid, having been cancelled by a later firman of 1903. The Sheikh now expressed his determination to resist any further interference, if necessary by force, and commenced taking steps to secure the allegiance of his tribes. Mr. Ovey instructed His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz to inform the Sheikh (a) that he realised the latter’s anxiety, but that he could not believe that the Persian Government could legally proceed to the lengths feared; (b) that he would call the Prime Minister’s attention to the grave issues involved and hoped to prevent any precipitate action • and (c) that if instead of awaiting the results of the support of His Majesty’s overnment, the Sheikh were to commit any rebellious act, he would be puttino* nimself m the wrong and would prejudice his case with His Majesty’s Govern- W t° re . 7 f ia f ne d always willing fully to support his just claims. Mr. Ovey added that if the Sheikh thought that the Prime Minister’s position had been shaken by recent political developments he was much mistaken and instructed the Acting Consul to use every argument to keep the Sheikh quiet. On the 23rd August the Foreign Office telegraphed to Mr. Ovey informing him of reports received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that the Sheikh was forming an alliance with the Bakhtian, Kashgai, &amp;e., and was speaking of inviting the Shah to return to Mohammerah. Mr. Ovey was instructed («) to have a furthlr message sent to the Sheikh to the effect that, while he might rest assured that, undfr instructions from His Majesty s Government, Mr. Ovey was doing his utmost to induce the Persian Government to accord just consideration to the Sheikh’s recognised rights and interests, he must be reminded that the British assurances were dependent upon his loyalty to the central Government and that he should refrain from any violent action which would be highly prejudicial both to his own and British interests; and (J) to inform the Persian Prime Minister that is recent administrative measures in South-West Persia appeared to be inconsistent with repeated assurances given to His Majesty’s Government and threatened vital British interests in those regions where they could not view any untoward developments with indifference; Reza Khan should therefore te urged to abstain from pressing matters to an issue. Mr. Ovey took active steps and in the result the Prime Minister sent a message to the Sheikh CmCg toat ' Jls P?f eS y n g him but that his attention wS Irawn o the tact that he must not sell land to foreigners, and assuring him of suonort ZSwtl pi rih a a S n he s °b 0ntinUe C, t0 1,6 P 6 Sheikh wafnCryet sSS especially as Keza Khan subsequently sent him a bombastic and tactless teWram VtefA conver y tlon with His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz (Colonel Peel) expressed his determination to overthrow Reza Khan or perish in the atCCn,k • t - opinion the struggle was inevitable and there was more chance of success at that time than later; he insisted that he was not taking the inittetire but defending his dSC^ meaCCreroM^TC^'p^ M- declared that he would al &gt;andof s uerensive measures only if the Prime Minister agreed (i) to give written E 4642/263/ 34/1924.

In addition, the Sheikh required a guarantee from His Majesty’s Government against unfriendly acts by Beza Khan in the future, and asked whether they would sell him arms and ammunition secretly. Colonel Peel added that he anticipated no danger to the pipe-line and that the Sheikh was unlikely to make any move against Persian troops unless he were attacked or reinforcements were sent towards Bebehan. 39. On September 13th Mr. Ovey was requested to instruct the Political Resident to proceed to Mohammerah and hold language to the Sheikh in accordance with the Foreign Office instructions of the 23rd August, and he was also told to convey a message to the Prime Minister (then in Luristan) warning him of the great danger to which he might be exposing South-West Persia. These instructions were followed by others on the 17th September authorising Mr. Ovey to negotiate with Reza Khan with a view to the acceptance of the Sheikh’s conditions (i) and (iv) and as regards (ii) of a compromise that troops should ^ not be reinforced as long as the Sheikh undertook to behave properly. In addi tion, a further message was to be sent to the Sheikh explaining what was being attempted on his behalf, but stating that His Majesty’s Government could not condone his warlike attitude or assist him in any way to defy the Persian Govern ment, and that, unless he abandoned his warlike attitude, they could not hold themselves responsible for the consequences. In the meantime, the Political Resident had interviewed the Sheikh, his second son (Abdul Hamid), the Bakhtiari Amir Mujahid and Colonel Riza Quli Khan (who had replaced Colonel Baqir Khan at Shushtar but who had apparently thrown in his lot with the Sheikh); all declared that no peace with Reza Khan was possible; the Sheikh had telegraphed to the Majlis explaining that his opposition was to Reza Khan personally and that it was hoped to persuade the Shah to return. On September 16th the Sheikh had also addressed a telegram to the foreign legations in Tehran in the nature of a proclamation against the Prime Minister, who was described as “a usurper and a transgressor of the Persian nation.” ^ The Foreign Office therefore felt it necessary to inform Mr. Ovey that His v Majesty’s Government had no wish to avoid the guarantees to the Sheikh so long as he should maintain an attitude on which they were conditional, but that he would not be justified in looking to them for support were he to kindle a war and suffer defeat. The Foreign Office felt that it was essential that the atti tude of His Majesty’s Government should be clearly understood by the Sheikh, who might be led into the belief by other British contacts {e.g., local repre sentatives of the oil company) that he would have the sympathy of the British Government in his struggle. 40. Reza Khan, from whatever motive, reacted favourably to Mr. Ovey s representations and practically placed himself in the hands of His Majesty’s Government; he undertook to refrain from asking the Majlis to proclaim the Sheikh a rebel and to approve warlike operations; he further undertook to confirm the Sheikh’s firmans, to recapitulate all his previous assurances to the Sheikh, and to guarantee the lives and properties of the Sheikh and his family and also Amir Mujahid. In return, Reza Khan said he must insist on Amir Mujahid’s exile and the Sheikh’s absence from Persia for three months, during which time he would definitely undertake to refrain from any military action or threats; he would also guarantee the Sheikh’s return, provided the latter made a suitable declaration of submission. All these undertakings were neces sarily contingent upon His Majesty’s Government succeeding in restoring the status quo ante in Khuzistan. 41. The Foreign Office considered that Reza Khan was acting with moderation and their only criticism of his attitude was that the proposed insistence on the Sheikh’s temporary departure from Persia might bring about a state of civil war. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald ^directed that our policy should be to hold ourselves impartial and enjoin peace, adding that we should, of course, lean to the regular authority and impress both sides accordingly. He informed Mr. Ovey on the 22nd September that he, like Lord Curzon, had never opposed Reza Khan’s policy of consolidating power in the hands of the Central Govern ment, as the one wish of His Majesty’s Government was to see a strong and unified Persia: he hoped, however, that Mr. Ovey would be able to persuade Reza Khan to abstain from insisting upon what amounted to the temporary banishment of the Sheikh and instructed him to persuade the latter to abstain from mobilising his forces. The Sheikh, who expressed his confidence in theresult of a struggle with Reza Khan, proved difficult, and in an interview with Colonel Peel on tne 30th September, said that if his conditions were not accepted he would regard the British Government as having betrayed him. Further eftorts were made by Mr. Ovey to persuade the Sheikh to adopt a reasonable attitude and these were reinforced in a personal message which Mr. Ramsay MacDonald sent to the Sheikh in the middle of October. This message made it clear that His Majesty’s Government abided fully by the undertakings given to the Sheikh in the past, but that such undertakings were conditional upon the Sheikh’s observing his loyal obligations towards the Persian Government and that, in the regrettable event of hostilities, the Sheikh could expect no sympathy from His Majesty’s Government; Mr. Ramsay MacDonald expressed his confidence that an honourable settlement could be reached through the mediation of His .Majesty’s Government, and urged the Sheikh to desist from all military prepara tions and make his peace with the Central Government. 42. The Sheikh’s reply was to the following effect: he desired that His Majesty’s Government should procure for him an honourable settlement, but he could not accept the terms offered by His Majesty’s Legation because he would lose his position in his territories and could no longer maintain peace there, so that his friendship towards the British Government would be worthless to them; the British were holding him back but meanwhile Reza Khan was proceeding with his military preparations; he felt that he had already lost the support of the British Government and suggested that he should either retire from Khuzistan with his whole family (being granted a residence and means of subsistence) or else that he be freed from restraint and allowed to fight Reza Khan, which he felt confident of doing with success; in the latter case, he was equally confident of his ability to protect British lives and property. The best hope of a peaceful settlement now appeared to lie in arranging a meeting between Reza Khan and the Sheikh, and, acting on instructions, Mr. Ovey approached both with the suggestion that they should meet at some place other than Tehran and that Sir P. Loraine should be present at the interview. After persuasion Reza Khan agreed but stipulated that the Sheikh must first send some message of submission and Mr. Ovey then sent a message urging the Sheikh to comply and giving a personal assurance that such a message would be followed by an immediate cessation of military preparations on the part of the Central Govern ment. Matters were also helped on by the abandonment by Reza Khan of his demand that the Sheikh should temporarily leave Persia, but the Sheikh still made difficulties and it became clear that little could be done except play for time until Sir P. Loraine arrived in Persia and exercised his personal influence on both parties; and playing for time became increasingly difficult, particularly as, contrary to promises given to Mr. Ovey, Reza Khan continued to move his troops westwards of the line, Bebehan-Zaidun-Bander Dilam. 43. Early in November the Sheikh, influenced no doubt partly by His Majesty’s Government’s clear disapproval of his rebellion and partly by doubts as to the measure of support to be expected from the Bakhtiari and his other supporters, had decided to make his submission to Reza Khan; he expressed his readiness to meet the latter at Bushire provided that the meeting took place under the auspices of Sir P. Loraine and that the latter would give him assurances as to his safety. But Reza Khan was now becoming impatient at the delay, probably because the approach of winter would hamper military operations. Mr. Austen Chamberlain (who had succeeded Mr. Ramsay MacDonald at the Foreign Office) addressed a telegram to Sir P. Loraine on the 11th November explaining the view of His Majesty’s Government that the Sheikh, although to some extent provoked, had put himself in the wrong by planning rebellion and by insisting on the conditions (ii) and (iii) (see para. 38' above); it was hoped that Sir P. Loraine would be able to show both sides the folly of pushing matters to an extreme; it might be necessary to speak strongly to the Sheikh because Reza Khan could not be expected to ignore the implications of the Sheikh’s telegrams to the Majlis and the foreign legations and to meet the Sheikh without some preliminary expression of the latter’s regret; the Sheikh could, however, be informed that, mindful of his loyal services during the war, His Majesty’s Government were still doing their best to help him out of a difficult predicament. Sir P. Loraine was informed that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to see the Sheikh expelled or unduly humiliated, nor did they wish to prejudice their improved relations with the Persian Government; it was not desired to fetter Sir P. Loraine with detailed instructions, but if he could persuade the Sheikh to make the first move towards reconciliation, it did not seem unlikely that Reza Khan would be found ready to listen to reason.

Loraine met the Sheikh at Ahwaz on the 13th December and persuaded him to address to Reza Khan a telegram of regret and submission, but now Reza Khan made difficulties and was guilty of a number of breaches of faith. The rebellion had collapsed and he wished to drive home his advantage, while at Tehran criticism was being voiced in the Majlis regarding foreign intervention in Persian internal affairs. Reza Khan now demanded the Sheikh’s unconditional surrender instead of, as arranged, sending him a friendly message; Persian troops continued to move beyond the agreed line and Reza Khan expressed his intention of marching to Mohammerah; and he now made difficulties about meeting Sir P. Loraine and the Sheikh at Bushire, stating that this was no longer possible owing to the news of the proposal having leaked out. In addition, there was reason to believe that Moscow had put in a spoke to prevent a satisfactory arrange ment being reached. In view of Reza Khan’s attitude and the failure of our policy of “biased neutrality,” His Majesty’s Government and Sir P. Loraine now adopted a strong line with the Persian Government and Reza Khan, in the course of which the substance of the 1914 assurances to the Sheikh were disclosed to the Persian Government; the attitude of His Majesty’s Government now was that, by his submission, the Sheikh had put himself in the right, that they attached importance to abiding by their obligations to him (although, in view of the 4? situation in Egypt following the murder of Sir Lee Stack on the 19th November, thev were anxious not to be embroiled in South Persia), that they were still desirous of doing everything in their power to secure a settlement satisfactory to the Persian Government, but that if the latter persisted in attacking the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government reserved to themselves the right to take such measures as they might think fit in pursuance of their assurances to the Sheikh. But the latter was now a sick man and had suffered a moral collapse, and Reza Khan, by taking full advantage of His Majesty’s Government’s desire to avoid complica tions, was master of the situation. Sir P. Loraine expressed doubts whether it would be possible to obtain terms for the Sheikh favourable enough to make it worth his while to remain in Khuzistan, but he eventually arranged for Reza Khan and the Sheikh to meet at Ahwaz on the 6th December. After a preliminary meeting, Sir P. Loraine spoke to the former, explaining the position of His Majesty’s Government and emphasising the scrupulous loyalty of their attitude and tlieir strong desire that the Sheikh’s position should be substantially maintained. Reza Khan’s reply was reassuring : he wanted to maintain the Sheikh in effective authority, but must arrange this in such a manner as to disarm his critics in Tehran; he did not want a breach with His Majesty’s Government and promised to hold up the advance of Persian troops. The result of the Ahwaz conference seemed to bear out Reza Khan’s promises. He and the Sheikh swore friendship on the Koran; Persian troops were to remain at Shustar till the spring when, except for detachments, they would be withdrawn provided the pacification of Luristan had been completed; as a temporary measure Reza Khan would appoint a governor at Ahwaz, but this governorship would be restored to the Sheikh in the spring and meanwhile the temporary governor would have no power to interfere with the Sheikh’s authority over the Arab tribes; minor points regarding jurisdiction, police, taxation, &amp;c., were reserved for subsequent discussion and all Persian officials, including the military, would have strict orders to work in harmony with the Sheikh and give him any help he might require. Reza Khan assured Sir P. Loraine that he would not allow agitation in Tehran to deflect him from his purpose and that Sir P. Loraine could be free from anxiety. Sir P. Loraine also reported that Reza Khan realised that the Soviets had been adopting a perfidious attitude throughout in an endeavour to prevent a peaceful settlement and to drive Reza Khan into armed action. The New Attitude of His Majesty's Government, 1925. 45. The immediate crisis was over but matters were by no means finally settled. It was clear, however, that the old regime had come to an end and that Reza Khan, having established a strangle-hold over Khuzistan would be unlikely ever voluntarily to relinquish it. His Majesty’s Government were now in an embarrassing position : the services which the Sheikh had rendered them in the past and general considerations of prestige in Persian Gulf made it undesirable that they should abruptly terminate their assurances to the Sheikh; the safety of the oilfields and of British lives had to be considered; but the assurances were not compatible with the general policy of strengthening the Central Government and the embarrassing position in which His Majesty’s Government found them selves presented the Soviet Government with wonderful opportunities for fishing in troubled waters. During his discussions with Reza Khan at Ahwaz,17 Sir P. Loraine had told him that the most serious danger of friction in South Persia between Great Britain and Persia would arise from friction between the latter and the Sheikh and that he believed that a close understanding between Reza Khan and the Sheikh would directly strengthen the position of Reza Khan and his Government in Tehran—which would be in accordance with the desires of His Majesty’s Government; he went further and stated that he wished all Great Britain’s friends in South Persia to be friends of Tehran and to help their own Government and for the latter to feel that the south was safe, loyal and peaceful, so that, should danger arise from other quarters, the south’ could be relied on. In replying to Sir P. Loraine’s report on his proceedings, Sir Austen Chamberlain said :— E649/136/34/ 1925. I share your view that the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Persia should be to discourage separatist movements likely to weaken the central authority of the Persian Government and am of the opinion that the policy outlined m your despatch of rallying the tribal chieftains of South Persia to the support of the Persian Government is best calculated to improve the relations of His Majesty s Government with that Government. The chieftains themselves will thus be led to realise that their traditional friendship with His Majesty’s Government is fully compatible with their duty as loyal Persian subjects.” Sir P. Loraine was aiming at a final and honourable discharge of His Majesty s Government’s obligations to the Sheikh so that our future action on e 2100 / 136 / His benalt could be limited to securing, so far as possible without prejudice to 34/1925. our relations with the Persian Government, the observance of Reza Khan’s promises as ^ regards the Sheikh s future position, while continuing to urge the Sheikh to deal with Reza Khan direct in matters affecting his own position and authority. Given a correct attitude on the part of the Sheikh therefore, everything turned upon the good faith of Reza Khan. The Final Downfall of the Sheikh, 1925. 46. After the Ahwaz meeting, the Sheikh appears to have resigned himself to the new regime and his main concern was now to retain his properties; but he was in an uncomfortable position, because, with his loss of prestige, he’ had become the target for claims by many whom he had dispossessed while at the height of his power. He informed Reza Khan that he wished to divide his properties among his sons and travel abroad, but Reza Khan asked him not to leave Persia and urged him to proceed to Tehran, where his presence would greatly assist in the regularisation of the position as regards his properties. (Reza Khan may or may not at this time have been genuinely desirous of arriving at a satis factory settlement of the Sheikh’s affairs, but it is worthy of note that he subse quently mentioned to Sir P. Loraine the possibility that the Sheikh would retire to Iraq, where his presence would be an embarrassment to the Persian Government; no doubt this consideration played its part in Reza Khan’s anxiety to persuade the Sheikh to visit Tehran.) The Sheikh, in spite of reassuring messages from Reza Khan and of Sir P. Loraine’s advice to comply with Reza Khan s request, was undoubtedly afraid to proceed to the capital. He spoke to the acting British Consul at Ahwaz on the 18th April about his grievances main taming that Reza Khan had broken his promises to him and tfiat he could no longer place any faith in his word; the Sheikh had been advised to rest but if he went to Tehran he would be worried into his grave and doubted whether he would ever be allowed to leave the capital; such a journey would be a further humiliation and he could not go there as a suppliant seeking to regain property which was his legally. He eventually told Mr. Monypenny that, while he would not go himself he would send a representative to Tehran J but this decision was too late, for on the same day he and his son, Abdul Hamid, were arrested by Reza Khan s orders and taken to Tehran under escort. ^ i fl 47 Q , ^ K1 l an f u g ht t0 justify this new breach of faith as necessitated by the Sheikh s refusal to proceed to Tehran voluntarily and by the possibility of his taking up residence in Iraq. To put himself right with Sir P^Loraine^ he readily agreed to the latter s suggestion that the Sheikh should receive a welcome on approaching Tehran and should “arrive honourably and in no way under arrest, and said that a house was being placed at his disposal at which his real personal friends (though not political agitators) could visit him. Sir P Loraine’s view was that there were only two alternative methods of dealing with the [32557] 8 E1572/136/ 34/1925. E2502/136/ 34/1925. E3046/136/ 34/1925. E3407/136/ 34/1925. E3046/136/ 34/1925.

K4817/453/ 234/1935, &lt;fcc., &amp;c. situation : either an attempt to patch it up or a definite breach with Reza Khan— and a breach at this time would have been more than unfortunate as the prospects of settling the Persian debt question were quite hopeful and Russo-Persian relations were showing distinct signs of strain. He had, with the approval of His Majesty's Government, tried the first course and all now depended upon whether Reza Khan would arrange the Sheikh’s affairs in a satisfactory manner. At first, everything promised well as the Sheikh told Sir P. Loraine that he had been treated with the greatest consideration and respect, that Reza Khan had given him a warm and affectionate welcome and had said that political considerations had obliged him to bring the Sheikh to Tehran as an act of authority but that there would shortly be a relaxation. In addition, Reza Khan renewed his promise to Sir P. Loraine to put the Sheikh’s affairs straight, undertaking, if the Sheikh behaved wisely, to rehabilitate his prestige in a public manner; and by the beginning of October Sir P. Loraine was able to report good prospects of a satisfactory settlement on the basis of the payment by the Sheikh of a sum of half a million tomans as his share of the expenses of the Khuzistan campaign of 1924, in return for which his firmans would be ratified and he would be allowed to return with tribal authority and high position (but without the right to have armed forces). &gt; 48. Although in certain quarters closely interested in the fate of the Sheikh there was a feeling that he had been “ let down ” by His Majesty’s Government, his arrest and removal to Tehran did not lead to a loss of British prestige to the extent that might have been expected given the key position which he had formerly held and the manner in which that position had been built up with the support of the British Government. As a measure of the interest taken in the event in this country it may be noted that it inspired only one question in Parliament, and that was answered without difficulty and without giving rise to supplementaries. As far as Khuzistan was concerned, apart from a purely local disturbance at the time of the arrest, the event was received with apparent indifference. The Sheikh’s son Abdullah acted as chief of the Muhaisin during his father’s absence (and, incidentally, did so more in his own than in his father’s interests). It is true that at the end of July, 1925 there was a short-lived tribal rising at Mohammerah (for which the Sheikh was in no way responsible), but this was due not so much to sympathy with the Sheikh in detention at Tehran as to other causes—economic factors, the removal of experienced head-men and the rule of Persian officials over Arabs, feared new taxation and threatened loss of properties, 'plus, it was suspected, Soviet intrigues. Subsequent negotiations and the death of the Sheikh. 49. Little object would here be served by a detailed account of the negotia tions between the Persian Government and the Sheikh during the latter’s last years at Tehran. It will suffice to record that the negotiations were marked not only by more than usual Oriental procrastination but also by gross breaches of faith on the part of the Central Government, who had obviously no intention of carrying out the promises given to the Sheikh and to Sir P. Loraine at the end of 1924 and subsequently and who were obviously merely waiting for the Sheikh to die. His Majesty’s Government continued unofficially to urge the Persian Government to come to a satisfactory settlement and release the Sheikh, but their efforts were unavailing and in the end even the Sheikh himself came to realise that representations by His Majesty’s Legation on his behalf were more likely to do harm than good. After eleven years of detention, Sheikh Khazal died during the night of the 24th-25th May, 1936, having been deprived by the Persian Government of his estates in Khuzistan and without any settlement having been reached regarding the compensation which had been promised to him. In record ing the death of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran said : “ His epitaph might be what is perhaps the only genuine remark which the local authorities (in the person of Teymourtache in 1930) made about him, that the c interests of the individual must be sacrificed to the public good.’ ” British relations with the Sheikh in matters outside Persian jurisdiction. 50. His Majesty's Government, with the recollection of the Sheikh’s services m the past and with their inability to carry out the assurances which they had given him, had the Sheikh very much on their conscience. Consequently, they did their utmost to meet any claims which the Sheikh might have against them in so far as matters lay outside Persian jurisdiction. Thus, in 1935, they and the Government of India jointly made an ex gratia payment to him of 50,000 rupees in repayment of a loan which he had advanced to the Government of India in19 1924—25. This loan was in respect of the erection of consular premises at Ahwaz, the building of which had been commenced but had, after the fall of the Sheikh, been abandoned owing to certain town-planning schemes. The Sheikh’s title to the land in question was more than doubtful and he had none to the buildings except for the foundations; and it was not considered that he had any legal claim against either the Government of India or His Majesty’s Government in the matter. But the Foreign Office successfully urged that the loan should be regarded as a debt of honour and that it should be repaid on the grounds of His Majesty’s Government’s moral responsibility for doing anything possible for our former protege, who, in addition to his political fall, was now in grave financial straits. 51. The repayment of the loan in respect of the Ahwaz consular site was of relatively minor importance although illustrative of His Majesty’s Govern ment’s attitude. Of much greater importance, however, was the question of the Sheikh’s date gardens in Iraq, regarding which assurances had been given in 1914 (see last paragraph of Document No. 6 in the Annex). A detailed account of developments in this highly complicated question would be out of place in the present memorandum, but very briefly the position was as follows. The assurance to the Sheikh was fully implemented during the period when His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were responsible to the League of Nations for the administration of Iraq, but successive Iraqi Governments refused to accept the financial commitment in this assurance (and in a similar one given to the Sheikh of Koweit) as binding upon Iraq after the establishment of the indepen dence of that country in 1932. In that year the Iraqi Government altered their system of taxation upon agricultural products by a measure known as the Istihlak tax, as a result of which taxation was no longer levied on the land itself but on such parts of the crop as were sold or exported. It was decided that, in the E 2649/18/93/ event of continued failure to persuade the Iraqi Government to accept the financial commitment to the two Sheikhs, an obligation to compensate the latter must rest upon His Majesty’s Government. The cases of the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit differed in that the latter was nominally independent whereas the former was not, and in any case the question arose whether Sheikh Khazal could have a successor ” in the sense of the 1914 assurances. It was decided, however, that in this matter the Sheikh should be treated during his life-time on the same basis as the Sheikh of Koweit and the whole question of compensation was under active consideration when Khazal died. The decision was then reached that pay ment of compensation for losses in respect of Istihlak taxation should be made to tlhe Sheikh’s heirs on an ex-gratia basis, and in 1940/41 the sum of £15,218 was ei365/iio/ distributed among them in full and final settlement of past losses on account of 93/1940. this taxation since 1932 and of prospective further losses from this or alternative E456, E 1836 / forms of taxation on the land or its produce; in return, the heirs (or their trustees 456 / 93 / 1941 in the case of minors) were required to sign documents accepting payment as a full settlement of any claims against His Majesty’s Government under the pledge given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah in 1914 in this particular regard. The fate of the British assurances. o2. While, as has been seen, the policy of His Majesty’s Government after the Sheikh s rebellion in 1924 had been to endeavour honourably to disembarrass themselves of the assurances given to him in times when circumstances were very different, and while they could, on a strict reading of those assurances, have declared that the Sheikh’s disregard of their advice both in 1924 and in 1925 had rendered the assurances null and void, the fact is bhat they never did so. All was changed by the arrest of the Sheikh and subsequent acts of bad faith on the part of the Shah, and no purpose would have been served and the feelings of an old and sick man, who still regarded His Majesty’s Government with friendli ness and loyalty, would have been deeply wounded by any such action. The assurances therefore (for what they were now worth)' were merely allowed to lapse on his death. In June, 1944, however, Sheikh Chassib, Khazal’s renegade eldest son, wrote to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran calling attention to the e 4039 / 155 / assurances and enlisting the suppoi t of His Majesty’s Government in the demand 34 / 1944 - of Sheikh Khazal s family for the restitution of their rightful properties. His Majesty s Government s attitude towards any suggestion that their assurances extended after the death of Khazal to his family was explained to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in a despatch of the 29th August, 1944. After describing why the assurances were not regarded in principle as having lapsed during the sheikh’s lifetime, this despatch made the following points :— (ft) His Majesty s Government need have no feelings of delicacy towards Sheikh Khazal’s heirs, as they had had towards the Sheikh himself [32557] D 2in divesting themselves of all future responsibility under the assurances in so far as they related to Persia; ^ ^ (b) it was true that the assurances spoke of the Sheikh’s successors, but there was no successor to the Sheikh in the position which he held when the assurances were given; (c) the assurances referred to the nomination of successors by the Sheikh, and consultation with and approval by His Majesty’s Government was provided for : but so far as was known, the Sheikh did not nominate a successor and there was certainly no consultation with His Majesty’s Government in the matter; (d) if Sheikh Chassib, as the eldest son, regarded himself as the successor, he could hardly say that he had been guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government and had maintained an attitude satisfactory to that Government. Mr. Lascelles was therefore told that, in any dealings with Sheikh Chassib, His Majesty’s Legation should act on the assumption that His Majesty’s Govern ment were no longer bound by any assurances in respect of Sheikh Khazal himself or his family; this would not preclude His Majesty’s Legation from using their good offices on behalf of the family when this might appear desirable or expedient, but it should be understood by all concerned that any action taken in this sense would be as a matter of grace and not of obligation. HUGH K. GREY. Foreign Office, October 1946. ANNEX. Texts of British Assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, 1902-14. No. 1. Sir A . Hurdinge to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) 7th December, 1902. I write to inform you, my honoured friend, of my return to Tehran from Europe and to enquire after your health. It was a great disappointment to me that I was unable to visit you this spring, but, as you know, I was obliged to go to England instead. I hope, however, that it may be possible for me at no distant date to have the pleasure of making your personal acquaintance. I was very glad to hear from Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar of the satisfactory arrangement concluded between you and the Department of Customs. On general grounds of policy it is very desirable that differences should as far as possible be avoided between the Persian authorities and the Arab tribes under your rule. The relations between the British and Persian Governments are of a friendly character, and the preservation of the integrity and independence of the Persian monarchy has for many years been one of the great objects of British policy in this part of the world. Disturbances of a nature to imperil that object would be a serious evil, and you would gain little and might endanger much by throwing off the sovereignty of the Shah. I am convinced that, under the present circum stances, the Arabs, and yourself as their ruler, have every interest in cultivating good and loyal relations with the Government of Tehran, and that the latter has no desire to oppress you or curtail your authority. For this reason I think you acted wisely in giving up all idea of forcible resistance to the establishment of a custom-house, and in seeking rather to come, as I have from the first urged you to do, to a friendly understanding on the subject with the Customs Administration. Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar asked me on your behalf to what extent you might rely on the protection of the British Government, and I told him that so long as you behaved to us, as you have done in the past, in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of your hereditary rights and customs, and to dissuade the Government of Tehran from any endeavour to diminish or interfere with them. Hajji Reis thereupon said that you were not afraid of the Persian Government itself, nor of attack by21 neighbouring tribes acting or professing to act under its orders; but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign Power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways: either such a foreign Power might be at war with Persia, and might, as an enemy of the Shah, send ships to attack your district; or such a Power, pretending to be the friend of the Persian Government or to act on its behalf, might attempt, also by means of its ships, to conquer you and the Arabs. I replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely, but if either were to arise we should, I believed, interfere, provided you had acted in accordance with our advice; and our fleet, which is the strongest of any in the Gulf, would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. J stated, however, that I would refer these questions to the Foreign Minister of the British Government, and he has now authorised me to say that we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support. As I have, however, said above, I do not regard the danger—at any rate at present—as a real one. The Persian Government desires, I am sure, as earnestly as you do, the preservation of peace in Arabistan, and the establishment of a custom-house at Mohammerah is, as I assured you last year, a fiscal, not a political, measure. It has already informed me in a friendly spirit of the conditions under which the new arrangement has been made, and the British Government has instructed me to intimate its acquiescence in them. We reserve, of course, our right to object to any further change which we may consider likely, as affecting peace and trade on the Karun, to be detrimental to our interests. I trust that the new arrangement may work smoothly. There will be very likely some small difficulties and friction at first, but I trust to your wisdom and judgment to deal with them prudently and patiently. Our consul has my orders to afford you all help and advice, and you may place every reliance on my friendship. You can write to me freely should you wish to do so, as well as to the Resident at Bushire. ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. No. 2. Sir A. Hardinge to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, ^Ath December, 1903. 1 have received a telegram in reply to the one to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Mohammerah, after my first interview with your Xj X COll 611 cy. Lord Lansdowne says that if, as he presumes is the case from my account of your Excellency s statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repudiate the arrangement made with you last year, I am authorised to say that you are m his opinion, justified m opposing such attempt. He instructs me to remind you of the message which he sent you last year, and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observe the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself . He has authorised me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting the conditions of the arrangement on their side. I do not propose to do so until I hear further from you, as I think it will be better m the interests of good relations between the Persian authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked until all other means of adjusting matters directly between them and you have been exhausted. Meanwhile I should be obliged if you would send me to Tehran, through His Majesty’s Resident at Bushire a copy of the note from M. Naus, promising not to take duty on your personal imports, and any further information on the subject. I have, &amp;c. ARTHUR H. HARDINGE.22 No. 3. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) December, 1908. After enquiry after your welfare and congratulations on the satisfactory conclusion of your business with the Arab tribes, I have the honour to inform you that I duly communicated to Government all that passed at the interview which I and our friend Mr. McDouall had with your Excellency on the 7th January last, and also placed before them the statement of Government expenditure subsequently received from you through Mr. McDouall. The reply of His Majesty’s Government reached me through His Majesty’s Legation in September last, but, in view of the importance of the subject and the insecurity of the post, I: thought it best to delay addressing you until my return to headquarters. On arrival here I learnt of your own absence in Arabistan, and have since waited for your return to Failieh. I am directed to repeat, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, the assurances given to your Excellency in the letter of His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, dated the 7th December, 1902, which is in your possession, 4 and the terms of which I repeated to you at our interview above referred to, and I am then to add that His Majesty’s Government now extend those assurances to your successors. I am further to point out that His Majesty’s Government have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, and to explain that that under taking involves the maintenance of the status quo in that country, and includes the continuance of the state of autonomy which your Excellency at present enjoys. It follows from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity which is recognised by the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention. Trusting to have an opportunity of repeating the foregoing assurances in person at an early date, I am, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His £ Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Pars, &amp;c. No. 4. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After the usual compliments.) Mohammerah, \§th May, 1909. On the 1st December, 1908, I had the honour, by the direction of His Majesty’s Government, to repeat to your Excellency the assurances given you on behalf of Government by his Excellency Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, in his letter of the 7th December, 1902, to your address, and to inform you that the British Government were now prepared to extend those assurances to your successors. I was further directed to explain to you that the British Government had engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and that that undertaking in itself involved the maintenance of the status quo in Persia, and thus included the continuance of the same state of autonomy which your Excel lency at present enjoys. I was then to point out that it followed from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an act of infringement of that Persian integrity which has received recognition in the Anglo-Russian Convention. While expressing your thanks for these amplified assurances, you repre sented that they seemed to you only to safeguard you so long as Persia continued to exist as a sovereign State, and you pressed for a further assurance which would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a sovereign State and the inter vention or occupation by foreign Powers. You also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provided immunity against unwarrantable encroachment on your rights by the absolute government of His Majesty the Shah, or whether it also covered prevention of T wm \ T23 similar action on the part of parliamentary government. In reply to those representations, your Excellency was informed that Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, the British Government were not, properly speaking, able to admit even the possibility of Persia ceasing to be a sovereign State or coming under the occupation of a foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency the assurances already given to your Excellency would become even more binding than before. I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now pre pared to extend the application of those assurances to your “ heirs and successors.” Mr. McDouall and I have informed you that in our opinion the assurances as now extended and expressed, appear to satisfy all your requirements; but you have further requested that the words “heirs and successors ” may be changed and the words “ own successive male descendants ” may be written instead; and you have gone on to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government will be pleased to dispel the last shadow of doubt from your mind regarding their own intentions in the future, by adding after the words “male descendants” as above, the words “ up to a period of 100 years ” (or if it be possible 150 years). I cannot give your Excellency any reply on this point without reference to Government, but I will lose no time in communicating to them your representations. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. No. 5. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh. (After compliments.) Mohammerah, Ibth October, 1910. I have the honour to intimate personally and in writing that I am authorised to inform your Excellency that whatever change may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself, and are intended to extend to your male descendants so long as you and they shall not have failed to observe your obligations towards the central Government, and shall continue to be acceptable to your tribesmen, to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to them.

With reference to the assurances conveyed to your Excellency in my letter dated the 15th October, 1910 ( = llth Shawwal, 1328), and having regard to the further valued services and co-operation which your Excellency has rendered to the British Government and British interests in Arabistan and the Shatt-el-Arab, I am now authorised to assure your Excellency personally, and do so by this24 writing, that whatever change may take place in the form of the government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution, both to yourself and to us, in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against any unprovoked attack by a foreign Power, or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself and for ypur successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and their obligations towards the Persian Government, provided always that the nomination of your successors from among your male descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of, His Majesty’s Government, and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. Vis-a-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy.

Shaikh Abdullah Khaza f al M.B{Extract from the Newspaper Al-Ahram of Cairo dated the 19th March, 1947.) We have received a statement from the Iranian Embassy here in which they have referred to what ha^? been published in some newspapers on the occasion of the Arab General Conference, expected to be held in Cairo, that the Preparatory Committee of the Conference is still receiving telegrams of support from all parts of the Arab World, and that Shaikh Abdullah son of Shaikh Khaza’al, the ex-Amir of Mohammarah has been elected a delegate of Arabistan, 'Ahwaz”, to attend this Conference. This makes one think that Ahwaz, which they call 'Arabistanis inside the Arab countries. The statement adds, 'As there is no territory in Iran by the name of Arabistan, and as Ahwaz is a town inside the territory of the well-known Khuzistan, the Iranian Embassy in Egypt hastens to correct this news. The Embassy confirms also that Shaikh Abdullah son of Shaikh Khaza’al has no authority to speak in the name of the people of Iranian Khuzistan'. M.B. $I . EXPRESS L From Political, Kuwait.

It is certain that your prudence and wise conduct in denying and refuting the unfounded reports will have a beneficial effect upon the views of the high authorities. the Consulate's was pointed out in letter No.107 dated the 26/11/30,has in accordance with its duty referred the matter to Headquarters for orders, and has now upon receipt of your letter again reminded Headquarters. As soon as a reply is received you will be informed without delay. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter and also letter No.107 dated the 26/13/30 to the Consulate. Concerning the issue of a passport and visa BR.-I have read in your issue of 19th March, 1947, a reference to the statement of the Iranian Embassy on the subject of what had been published in some papers on the occasion of the M General Arab Conference M intended to be held in Cairo, stating that I had been elected as a delegate for Khuzistan to attend the Conference, I am sorry to have to state now that the news so frequently reported by the papers has been imputed to me without my knowledge; nor have I any idea of the purpose of the publication of ouch news. My relations with the Iranian Government are excellent and I, like my father Shaikh Ehaza'l, love and respot Iran and should be honoured to sacrifice my life for her glory and for the welfare of her people. I, being the son of the ex-Amir of Khuzistan, and possessing such qualifications as to entitle me now to speak in the name of Khuzistan 1 s people, am able to affirm with full confidence, pride, and trust, that the young Iranian Government spares no effort/in the intro duction of several improvements to lead her people always forward. She makes no distinction among various classes of her people in this respect. They are all equal and welfare is for them all. My advice to those who have a special interest in disseminating dissension and disunion among classes through the publication of seditious and false news is that activities of this kind would harm relations between the Eastern Islamic Powers at the time when we are in pressing need of friendly relations and co-operation. I blame those Arabic newspapers which at times publish false news given by irresponsible people which may lead to a crisis which the publishers of whese papers themselves probably desire less than anybody.

As you will realize, Abdulla Khazal showed wisdom in not accepting Mr. Oavam Sultaneh’s invitation to return to Persia, but he came to see me yesterday and said that he now wished to obtain authoritative permission from the Shah, as he thinks the political atmosphere suitable at the moment. He therefore requested that I should ask you, in view of the past acquaintanceship which he claimed, to intervene on his benalf through the British Embassy in Tehran, should you feel inclined so to do.

Much of the correspondence discusses whether Shaikh Abdullah, who has taken refuge in Kuwait after an unsuccessful attempt to return to live in Persia, should be given a British pension or an allowance, in order to prevent him from attempting to return to Persia, since it is deemed unlikely that he will receive any compensation from the Persian Government for the loss of his father's property.Also included in the file are a copy of a document from the Combined Intelligence Centre, Iraq, entitled 'The Sheikhdom of Mohammerah A Short History' and a Foreign Office report entitled 'British Relations with Khazal, Sheikh of Mohammerah'.The principal correspondents are the following: the Political Agent, Kuwait; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the British Consul, Khorramshahr; the India Office; the Secretary of State for India; the Foreign Office; His Majesty's Ambassador, Tehran; His Majesty's Ambassador, Baghdad; the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmed al Jabir As-Subah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ]; Shaikh Abdullah bin Khaz‘al.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Asylum</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Khorramshahr</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Khaz'al Āl Ka'bī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Property</topic></subject><subject><topic>Inheritance and succession</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000a5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
