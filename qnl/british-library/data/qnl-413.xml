The main correspondents are Major Christopher George Forbes Fagan, Political Agent, Muscat; Political Resident Persian Gulf; Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department; Sheikh Abdullah bin Amir [Abdullāh bin Amīr] of the Bani Rahsib tribe. Topics discussed in the correspondence are:The gaining of control of the fort at Hazm and Rostak by the Sultan.The intrigues of the French Consul, Mr Ottawi to gain influence with the tribes of the interior;The visit of Sheikh Abdulla bin Amir of the Beni Rahsib for an interview with Major Fagan. The tribes were disgruntled that Sultan Faisal had discontinued their payments, particularly as they had helped him become Sultan. They had therefore decided to rebel against the Sultan and wanted to know if the British government would assist the Sultan against them or would stay neutral.A letter from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf requests that Major Fagan be informed 'that it is no part of his business to discuss with the tribes, or with their representatives, the possibilities or prospects of rebellion against their sovereign, to whom Major Fagan is accredited. Such proceedings can do no good and may involve the Government of India in serious responsibility.'</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Bani Rāsib (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000177#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
