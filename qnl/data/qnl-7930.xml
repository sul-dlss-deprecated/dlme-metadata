Also discussed are details regarding pay and periods of employment for postholders.The later correspondence (1947-1948) concerns arrangements for diplomatic representation in Saudi Arabia for the newly-independent governments of India and Pakistan. It includes discussion of the Indian Government's wish to appoint its own representative in Jedda, under the rank of Consul.The main correspondents are the following: His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (later referred to as Ambassador at Jedda; named postholders include Sir Reader William Bullard and later Laurence Barton Grafftey-Smith, succeeded by Alan Charles Trott); the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in India (Terence Shone); officials of the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Government of India's External Affairs Department, and the Office of the High Commissioner for India in London.The file includes two dividers which give a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year, one of which is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 1), while the other can be found at folio 38.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commission of India to the United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM High Commissioner to India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Vice-Consul, Jeddah</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Jedda</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Muslim pilgrims and pilgrimages</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Independence</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002c4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002c4#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002c4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
