The northern boundary of this peninsula is the desert known as the Northern Nefud, lying on or about lat. 30Â° N., but it is an open question whether we ought or ought not to include in c Arabia ^ the great triangle of steppe, the Hamad or Syrian Desert, which lies north of the Nefud and between Syria and Mesopotamia. Physically and ethnographically there is little distinction to be drawn between this steppe and the peninsula to the south of it, but the social and political relations of the latter are in many respects peculiar. The Arabian peninsula in fact is so far cut off from the rest of Asia by the Nefud that it is practically of an insular character. For the present purpose therefore Arabia is to be understood as limited on the north by a line drawn from the head of the Gulf of Akaba to the mouth of the Shatt el-Arab. Its most westerly point is near Akaba, its most southerly point near Aden, and its most easterly point near Muscat. More than half of it lies within the tropics. Its mean breadth is about 700 miles, its extreme length about 1,600 miles, and its total area approximately 1,000,000 square miles. Surface, Coasts, and Wadis Surface The most conspicuous physical feature of Arabia is the range of mountains running parallel to the western coast, mountains which in Midian on the north and in Yemen on the south rise to over 8,000 ft. The fall towards the Persian Gulf is long and gentle, while that towards the Red Sea is short and steep. The a 24 ARABIA highest land-levels therefore are in the west, being survivals of an originally much higher level^ preserved either by harder rocks or by caps of erupted matter^ which overlie the soft material of the mass of the peninsula. The central part of Arabia^ usually known as Nejd, has a mean elevation of fully 2,500 feet. Here and there^ as in Jebel Aja in the north centre^ harder masses stand up to over 5^000 feet, and in the east centre the broad plateau of Toweiq is uplifted about 600 feet above the surrounding country; but the mountains of Oman, where the summits of Jebel Akhdhar are as high as those of Midian and Yemen, are the only notable exception to the general eastward decline. Arabia consists mainly of desert or steppe. Of deserts there are four main varieties, distinguished by their surfaces: (1) Hahanah : this name is usually given to the comparatively hard gravelly plains, covered at intervals with parallel sand-belts of varying width, which stretch across the greater part of eastern Arabia. It is very barren at all seasons, but is likely to hold ground-water at a depth which can be reached by well-sinkers. (2) Nefud: a continuous area of deep sand, forced by wind- action into high sand-billows or dunes. It varies in passability according to (i) the frequency and proximity of the dunes; (ii) the nature of the sand, whether it be derived from granite, sandstone, or limestone; (iii) exposure to winter rainfall. If wholly or partially granitic, and situated in a zone of regular, though small, rainfall (as in the Northern Nefud), it offers a comparatively compact surface and also pasture during some months of the year. If wholly sandstone or limestone, it is softer, dustier, and less productive, but not wholly without vegetation in the spring, unless it occurs in a zone of slight and uncertain rainfall, as in the great southern desert (Ruba* el-Khali, or c Abode of Emptiness ^), the eastern half of which is partly nefud and partly dahanah. (3) Ahqaf : very soft dune country with comparatively narrow trough-intervals between continuous sand-billows, which are of considerable height. The western part of the Ruba' el-Khali is called ahqaf, but possibly this is only a local name for heavy nefud. (4) Harrah : a surface of corrugated and fissured lavas or scoriae, overlying either plain or mountain. It is very bad going, but lies in patches only, which can often be avoided altogether. There is a series of harrah tracts in the central west, the best known being that of Kheibar, north of Medina.SURFACE, COASTS, AND WADIS 5 In addition to these varieties of desert proper, there are great . tracts of hard or dusty surface, plain or undulating, which, having occasional natural water-holes and permanent coarse vegetation in hollows, should be called steppe rather than desert, and which are the chosen home of the camel-breeding nomads. There are vast stretches of steppe to the west of Nejd, but elsewhere the comparatively fertile central plateau is surrounded by desert. Within this ring of desert and steppe lies an elevated core of discontinuous fertility, which may be distinguished into three groups of more or less connected oases: (1) Jebel Shammar, which lies south of the Northern Nefud. Its chief town is Ha'il, and its oases owe their existence to the drainage from two lofty ranges, Jebel Aja and Jebel Selmah. (2) Qaslm. The fertility of this district is mainly due to the constant underground and occasional surface flow of the great Wadi Rummah. Its chief towns are Aneizah, Boreidah, and Rass. Qasim lies between Jebel Shammar and Nejd proper. (3) Nejd, by far the most extensive group, covers, with its steppe intervals, some 10,000 square miles. It consists princi pally of a more or less continuous chain of oases, lying either upon or under the flanks of the plateau of Jebel Toweiq. The present capital, Riyadh, lies in 'Aridh, the central oasis. The other fertile tracts of Arabia form a discontinuous outer ring on or near the coasts, the zone of fertility being widest in the mountainous region of Yemen in the south-west. In the east the desert and steppe are interrupted only in Hasa and Oman. In the former a series of springs at some distance inland creates a chain of oases, of which the richest are those of Hofuf and Qatlf. In the latter is the populous coastal plain known as Batinah, across which a number of fertile valleys descend from the heights of Jebel Akhdhar to the Gulf of Oman. In the south the hinterland of Hadhramaut contains several deeply sunk valleys, where water is very abundant in the subsoil. In Yemen, thanks to regular rainfall, the mountains are frequently cultivated, not only in their valley-bottoms but also on their slopes, and a zone of almost continuous fertility extends northwards from the Aden hinterland to Asir and the frontier of Hejaz. The country begins to be less uniformly fertile as its level falls away inland from the main ridge, but still conserves perennial vegetation in its valleys to a distance of about 200 miles from the Red Sea coast.6 ARABIA In Hejaz the monsoon rains cease, and the average altitude of the mountains drops some 200 feet over a stretch of about 300 miles. The isolated oasis therefore again becomes the only support of settled life. There are patches of cultivated land in hollows and wadi-beds between Mecca and the Wadi Hamdh, but practically none north of this wadi except the oases of Kheibar and Teima. Coasts Between the Red Sea and the mountains is a low, sandy strip (Tihamah) fringed with coral reefs. In Asir it is sometimes thirty miles in width, but in Midian and the extreme south the hills fall almost into the sea. The aspect of this coast is nearly everywhere desolate in the extreme. There are no good harbours, but only roadsteads, the approaches to which are often rendered difficult by shoals and reefs. In the southern half of the Red Sea there are numerous small islands near the Arabian coast, some being of volcanic origin. A few of these islands, such as the Farsan group, support a fishing population. Perim (British) is a volcanic island in the Straits of Bab el-Mandeb. In south-western Arabia, where the mountains get the fringe of the monsoon rains, there are patches of fertility along the coast at the wadi-mouths. East of the Straits of Bab el-Mandeb ; as far as the mouth of the Wadi Hadhramaut, the hills still fall abruptly towards the coast. East of this wadi they are lower, and the fertile wadi-mouths less frequent, and as Ras el-Hadd is approached the desert reigns unbroken. Along this southern coast there are no good harbours except Aden, though there are a number of bays intervening between projecting points. The coastal strip varies in width, rarely, however, extending much more than ten miles inland, and is usually an arid waste of plain and low sand-hills. The Kuria Muria Islands, twenty-five miles off the south-east coast of Oman, are a British possession. The most fertile stretch of Arabian coast lies between Ras el-Hadd and the mouth of the Persian Gulf. This is the Batinah district of Oman, which enjoys periodic rains. The harbour of Muscat is capable of admitting the largest vessels to an almost landlocked shelter, and there are other smaller but secure ports. From Ras Musandam to Qatif the shore is low, but occasionally palm-fringed and cultivated, while from Qatif to the mouth ofSURFACE, COASTS, AND WADIS 7 Shatt el-Arab it is almost continuous steppe-desert. The impor tant pearl islands of Bahrein, which support a population estimated at over 100,000, lie between Qatif and the peninsula of Qatar. Near the northern end of the Persian Gulf is the excellent harbour of Koweit, a place which furnishes the best native ships and sailors of these seas. Numerous shoals and reefs render the navigation of the Gulf difficult and dangerous. Wadis There are no rivers in Arabia which flow perennially from source to mouth. There are, however, numerous wadis, or river beds, which carry the floods (sing, sell) after rainstorms. There are perennial streams in the mountains of the south-west and south-east, and also in Nejd, but none of these reach the sea. The wadis which originate east of the western watershed are mostly long and shallow, their bottoms being very little depressed below the general level. The longest is the Wadi Rummah, which starts near Medina and descends through Qasim to the Shatt el-Arab, having a fall of 6,000 feet in about 1,000 miles. In its central course, where its underground drainage supports a large settled population, it is a wide depression, varying in breadth from two miles to 500 yards, and has a well-defined storm water-course. This sell may run from six to nine feet deep after heavy rain in the eastern harrah districts. Between the towns of Aneizah and Boreidah the sand has drifted across the depression so as to form a dam, which often holds up storm-waters for some months in a large lagoon. The chief wadi of Nejd is the Hanifah (called in its upper course the Wadi Heisiyah), which runs from Jebel Toweiq in a south-easterly direction, but probably never reaches the Persian Gulf. Where its ground moisture rises near or to the surface, as at Riyadh, it creates oases, and its valley is the heart of the district of 'Aridh. Both the Wadi Hanifah and the Wadi Rummah might be crossed at many points almost without the traveller being aware of their existence, but at all times they carry water beneath their beds, which can be reached by wells at varying depths. In south-western Nejd the province of Wadyan Dawasir owes its fertility to the great Wadi Dawasir, which is believed to rise in the plateau of Asir, but very little is known of its course. It is probably a continuation of the Wadi Bishah of xisir.8 ARABIA The largest valleys in Oman are the Wadi Sema/il and the Wadi Halfein, which rise on opposite sides of the same pass in the main range. The former is densely populated and, with the Batinah coast, is the principal seat of date-cultivation in Oman. The latter is the largest valley^ and carries the drainage of the inland districts southward to the Indian Ocean. The deeply sunk wadis, by which the plateau of Hadhramaut is intersected_, have a generally north or north-easterly trend, until they lead into the main wadi, which makes an immense easterly to south-easterly curve of over 500 miles until it reaches the Indian Ocean. The sides of these wadis are extremely abrupt and precipitous. They are remarkably fertile, for, though they have no visible perennial water-courses, water is very abundant in the subsoil throughout the system, and is procurable almost anywhere by sinking wells; this is especially the case in the main Hadhramaut wadi, or at least over a considerable part of its length, where vast reservoirs of water are available at little depths below the surface, at all times of the year, for the irrigation of large and continuous tracts of land. The last hundred miles of the wadi are, however, desert, owing to the almost complete absorption of the water higher up for irrigation purposes. The western side of the Yemen plateau drains towards the Red Sea through such wadis as the Suleil, Sardud, Bajil, Siham, Rema e , and Zebid, while others flow eastwards and lose themselves in the sand. In Asir, too, numerous fertile valleys run both east and west from the main ridge; the largest are those on the east, notably the Wadi Blshah and its tributary, the Wadi Shahran. In Hejaz the wadis produce less fertility, and in the northern part (Midian) practically none. The most important in Hejaz is the Wadi Hamdh, which debouches a few miles south of Wejh, and unites two main channels from the ridge, one draining the Kheibar harrah, the other the c Aweiridh harrah. The first gives Medina its underground water and extensive oasis; the second supplies the palm-groves of El- c Ala. Climate The climate of Arabia, thanks to its extreme dryness, is generally healthy and invigorating. Travellers in the desert or the mountains often suffer more from cold than from heat, and snow is not infrequent in the highlands of the north. In theCLIMATE 9 interior the nights are cool even in the hottest months, and on the highest plateaus the diurnal range of temperature is un pleasantly great. On the coast, however, the heat is usually oppressive, Jeddah, Hodeidah, and Muscat being among the hottest towns in the world. Given conditions under which adequate nourishment of the body can be obtained, as in the central oases, the birth-rate is high, and the average duration of life is long. Under other conditions, however, as among those Bedouins who pass the year round on the leaner steppes, exhaustion comes early in life. Climatic continuity with Persia and north-eastern Africa is hardly broken by the narrow seas which separate them from Arabia, and all these countries are exceptionally dry and rainless. Only in Yemen and Asir are there sufficient periodic rains for cultivation. For the rest, the most favoured region is the Northern Nefud with Jebel Shammar. Here, thanks to the absence of very high ground on the north-west, slight rains off the Mediter ranean produce a regular spring herbage; but the rainfall is less than that of the Egyptian Delta. On the rest of the central mass it falls to the almost negative record of Upper Egypt, and the greater part of the southern desert probably gets no more than an hour or so of drizzle once in every three or four years. The Midian highlands get a little more rain than the Egyptian Delta, and the rest of Hejaz a little more than Middle Egypt. Except at Ta'if in the extreme south of Hejaz, there are no seasonal rains as in Asir and Yemen. In Mecca and Medina, as well as farther north, heavy rains occur during thunder-storms, and the Hejaz railway was frequently damaged by floods in the spring and early summer of 1918. In the Hejaz lowland the mean annual temperature is nearly 90Â° F., and the air is damp. Mecca, owing to its low elevation (700 to 850 feet) and its back ground of naked slopes, is exceedingly hot in summer, but Medina, with a mean temperature of a little over 70Â° F., is healthy throughout the year. Ta'if is the healthiest of the towns of Hejaz, and shares the keen dry air of central Arabia; there is occasional frost on the surrounding mountains even during the summer months. Mecca, Kheibar, and the coast towns suffer from intermittent fevers, but on the whole the health of Hejaz is fairly good. The climate of the Asir Tihamah is as hot as that of Hejaz, but the water-supply is more abundant and of better quality. a 310 ARABIA The inner country is on the whole cooler than Hejaz^ and the climate of the mountains is temperate. On the inland slopes of the main ridge the winter is comparatively severe; night frosts are regular and frequent. On the Yemen coast the extreme dampness makes the heat very oppressive, in spite of the prevalence of heavy winds from the sea. There is very little rainfall either on the coast or in the Tihamah^ which is comparatively dry but intensely hot by day. The maritime ranges and. intramontane plains have a moister climate with close^ muggy nights, especially in the rainy season among the foothills; but as one approaches the higher elevation the air becomes more healthy and bracing. The principal rainfall occurs in the spring; but on the higher ground there are also thunder-storms in summer. Farther inland mists from the ravines often lie thick on the mountains, at 5,000 feet or more, and there are late summer as well as early spring rains. This favoured district is particularly suited to the cultivation of coffee. The plateau beyond it, in which the city of San'a is situated, is much drier, and usually cool and pleasant. The eastern range is hot and has a scanty rainfall, which decreases eastward. The climates of the various zones in the Aden Protectorate are similar to those in Yemen. On the main watershed there is considerable rainfall during the summer months, and a bracing and fairly equable climate with occasional slight frost at night. The coastal district of Hadhramaut is intensely hot and enervating, owing largely to the southern aspect of the coast and to the elevated region by which it is backed. In the narrow wadis of the interior, too, the temperature is very high, while the rains are less regular than on the western watershed. The coast of Oman, from Muscat southward, is as hot if not hotter than that of Hadhramaut. Muscat, however, though enervating in the summer and never bracing, is not an unhealthy town, if ordinary precautions are taken against bad water and mosquitoes. In 1912 th^ highest temperature was 114 0 F., and the minimum 64Â° F. The Batinah coast to the west is cooler, but feverish in the autumn. Many of the towns and districts at some elevation on the coastal side of the Hajar watershed, while open to the sea-breezes, are shut off by the range from the hot desert winds, and enjoy a fresh and temperate climate. In the interior the summer heat is oppressive, but in winter cold and wet weather is sometimes encountered. The average rainfall atCLIMATE 11 Muscat is only 4 inches, but the l^eavy interior rains sometimes cause devastating floods. The climate of the greater part of the Persian Gulf coast is not unlike that of Muscat, but in the northern part, as at Koweit, it is distinctly cooler. Healthier desert conditions prevail in the interior of Trucial Oman, Hasa, and the Sultanate of Koweit, while the islands of Bahrein are more malarial and less healthy than the coast. In January and February the Gulf is distinctly cold^ and there is occasional frost at Koweit, The average rainfall on the Arabian side is about 5 inches. The greater part of central Arabia has a healthy, temperate climate, and is often unpleasantly cold. Rainfall being very scanty throughout, all cultivation is dependent on irrigation. The prevailing winds are westerly, except in the Northern Nefud, where, as is shown by the altered direction of the sand-waves, they are deflected to southerly. Sanitary Conditions There is no drainage in Arabia, either in town or village, but the constant sunshine and the extreme dryness of most of the peninsula obviate the inconvenience and disease which would otherwise ensue, and which are in fact seriously felt in the damper climates of the coast. Privies are very rareâthe yard, roof, street, or even a room being used; only in the highlands of Asir are the houses kept thoroughly clean. In Nejd each house has a court or yard used for depositing dung, keeping domestic animals, &amp;c. In Arabian towns generally the streets are roughly swept every day, each householder taking care of the roadway lying before his own door. Plants and Animals Plants Considerable forests exist in Yemen and Asir, the principal trees being various species of fig, tamarind, carob, and Euphorbia. Among other trees which grow to a large size are the juniper, the Adenium ohesum, and the Zizyphus jujuba, while some fine aloes or agaves are also found. The tamarisk grows in wadi-beds all over Arabia, and the stony plains are often covered with acacia jungle. Almost everywhere brushwood and rough pasturage are12 ARABIA found in the hollows, but the best pasture is in the Northern Nefud after its seasonal rains. The following fruits are cultivated in the highlands of the south-west: vines^ apricots, peaches, apples, quinces, figs, plantains, melons, mangoes, pomegranates, limes, oranges, lemons, olives, almonds, and mulberries. But the principal fruit in Arabia, and one of its chief food staples, is the date, which flourishes in the low country, particularly in Nejd and Hejaz. There are said to be 139 kinds of date at Medina, the best class being the shelebi, which is exported to all parts of the Mohammedan world. El- 1 Ala is also a great source of date-supply to the Bedouins. In Oman there are flourishing date-groves at a height of over 2,000 feet above sea-level. All the fertile parts of Arabia produce crops of millet {dukhn and dhurd), wheat, barley, maize, and lucerne, as well as vegetables, such as potatoes, onions, and lentils. In southern Arabia sesame, cotton, indigo, and tobacco are also grown, while sugar-cane is cultivated in Oman and rice in Hasa. Coco-nuts flourish on the southern coast. In some places roses are grown for the manu facture of attar of roses, and the natives of Yemen are fond of mignonette, jasmine, thyme, lavender, and other aromatic plants. Coffee is the most important crop in Yemen, where it will grow at any altitude between 4,000 and 8,000 feet. It is not indigenous to Arabia, but was introduced by the Abyssinians during their invasion before the dawn of Islam. The plant reaches maturity in five years, attaining a height of from eight to ten feet, and ceases to be profitable after about twenty years. The plantations are laid out in terraces, many of which are centuries old, on every available spot on the mountain-sides. The harvest, broadly speaking, is in the autumn, but the berries ripen at intervals according to their position on the trees and the amount of sun shine to which the plantation is exposed. The local consumption of coffee is enormous, but it is also largely exported through Hodeidah and Aden. Another product of Yemen is kat, which the natives of southern Arabia chew for its stimulant properties. It is a small bush which is cultivated at an altitude of about 5,000 feet, and the tender leaves and twigs are cut yearly and sold in bunches. The aromatic gums for which Arabia was famous in ancient times are still produced, but the trade is a very small one. It is carried on chiefly at Suda, north-west of San c a, though the tree from which myrrh is extracted grows in many places.PLANTS AND ANIMALS 13 Animals Gazelles and small antelopes are common throughout Arabia, but the only large antelope is the Oryx beatrix, which lives in the north of Jebel Shammar and the Northern Nefud. Hyenas, jackals, panthers, wolves, hares, rabbits, and jerboas are fairly common in most parts of the peninsula, and in the mountains leopards and wildcats. A species of ibex exists in the mountains of Yemen and Hadhramaut, and monkeys are numerous in these countries. Among the common birds of Arabia are vultures^ hawks^ bustards, quails, partridges, sand- grouse, guinea-fowls, and pigeons. Snakes are common and for the most part poisonous, while scorpions and centipedes abound. Bees are kept in many places, the honey of Yemen and Hadhra- maut being particularly good. Locusts, which appear in great swarms, do much damage. In Hadhramaut a large species of lizard is eaten. The most important sea-fisheries along the Arabian coasts are those of the Persian Gulf^ especially at Koweit and Bahrein; the latter islands supplied 500 lb. of fish a day without difficulty to the Indian Expeditionary Force in 1914. Bahrein is also the principal centre of pearl-fishing. Cattle, sheep^ and goats are bred in great numbers. The cattle are mostly of the humped variety, but superior in milking qualities to those of India. They are particularly numerous in Asir, and are exported from Jeizan, one of the chief ports of Asir, to Massawa, the chief port of Eritrea. Donkeys are everywhere kept by the settled Arabs, many of them being of excellent quality, especially the white riding-donkeys often used by the wealthy classes. Only less patient of thirst than camels, the donkeys of Arabia provide an invaluable means of transport across the desert or steppe, where surfaces are moderately hard. The crossing of them with native mares produces a serviceable mule, which, however, is less well adapted for desert and steppe travel than the parent ass. Cattle- and camel-breeding are the chief occupations of the Bedouins throughout Arabia, and the pure-bred riding-camel is found in perfection only in central Arabia. Good baggage-camels, carrying loads of 400 lb., will march from twenty to twenty-five miles a day, and require water only every third or fourth day, even in hot weather; in cool weather, and with ample green14 ARABIA fodder^ they can cover an even greater daily distance without drinking at all. It is impossible to collect sufficient camels for the needs of a considerable military force in Arabia without the co-operation of leading Bedouin sheikhs. The famous horses of Arabia are of much less importance. They are bred chiefly in Nejd, and their main use is for the improvement of other breeds, for which purpose they are exported to India, Syria, and Egypt. Pure Arabs are kept only by the principal sheikhs: they are valued for use in war, for over short distances they will outstrip eveii the fastest camel. Mineral Resources Arabia is singularly deficient, as far as is known, in minerals of any commercial value, but a few are found in Yemen. Rock- salt occurs at Sallf on the mainland opposite Kamaran Island, and the flourishing salt-works there are under the control of the Ottoman Public Debt; most of the salt goes to India, but large quantities are also sent inland. There is a small amount of ore yielding coarse, brittle iron in Yemen, but the scarcity of fuel makes smelting impracticable. Petroleum has long been known to exist in the Farsan Islands, and a concession was granted to an Ottoman subject, but the results of experimental borings were of little value. Fine stones of agate, cornelian, onyx, and chalcedony are found in the hills around San'a. MAN Race, Language, and Religion Race The Arabs are a Semitic race, and are not confined to Arabia: they form a large proportion of the population of Syria, Mesopo tamia, and northern Africa, as well as the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf. In these countries, and in the coastal districts of Arabia, they have mixed much with other racesâJewish, Phoenician, Turkish, Negroid, Hamitic, &amp;c.âbut the inhabitants of the interior of the peninsula are the nearest existing approach to the pure Semitic type. According to their own traditions, the Arabs are descendedRACE, LANGUAGE, AND RELIGION 15 from the two sons of Abraham, Kahtan and Ishmael; the inhabi tants of Yemen^ Hadhramaut^ and Oman, who are mainly settled folk, claim descent from the former, while those of central and northern Arabia, who are mainly nomadic^ are children of Ishmael. Physically they are one of the finest races in the world. They possess a high degree of intelligence, but are deficient in organizing power and capacity for combined action, while they have an instinctive dislike of all kinds of governmental control. They are generally dignified, polite, and good-natured, but at the same time suspicious, revengeful, untruthful, and avaricious. The most hospitable and trustworthy of the Bedouins are those of the largest and best-knit tribes, especially such as form part of a federation under the control of one of the greater emirs or the King of Hejaz. Some of the lesser tribes on the other hand have the worst of reputations for treachery and cruelty. The townsmen of Hejaz and Qasim are very unwarlike, but those of the Yemen highlands are as sturdy fighters as any of the nomads. There are several thousands of Jews in Yemen, where they have their own quarters at San e a and other inland towns. There is also a considerable British Indian element at Mecca, Jeddah, Aden, and Muscat. Language The Arabic language is spoken throughout the peninsula, but considerable dialectic differences exist in different parts. Great attention is everywhere paid to accuracy of grammar and purity of diction. The purest Arabic, that which is as nearly as possible identical in the choice of words with the language of the Koran, is spoken in Nejd, and especially, it is said, in the province of Sedeir. Next in purity comes the Arabic of Jebel Shammar. Throughout Hejaz the language, though extremely elegant, is not equally correct; in Hasa, Bahrein, and Oman it is decidedly influenced by a foreign element called Nabataean. In Hadhramaut it merges into a Himyaritic or African dialect. Religion With the exception of a few Christians and Hindus in the coast towns, and the Jewish colonies in Yemen, the whole population of Arabia is Mohammedan. The great majority are Sunni, or orthodox Moslems, but there are groups of Shiahs, even among16 ARABIA the Bedouins, scattered throughout the country, while Hasa and central Yemen are predominantly Shiah. The Shiahs of Yemen are Zeidis, so called after Zeid, great- grandson of 'Ali, and established in Yemen by the Imam Hadi Yahya in a. d . 901. Through him the present Imam of Yemen claims descent from 'Ali, the fourth Caliph, by his wife, Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet. The Zeidis approach the orthodox Sunnis more nearly than any other sect of the Shiahs. Mecca, which is partly Zeidist, is tinged with heresy, and even the royal family of Hejaz is believed to have leanings towards Shiah doctrines. The Shiah pilgrims who visit Hejaz from Persia, India, Yemen, &amp;c., and the proximity of the Shiah holy cities, Nejef and Kerbela, tend to- keep heresy alive in the peninsula. Among the Sunnis themselves the Wahabites of Nejd have long made what is virtually a schism, cutting off central Arabia to some extent from the populations of the coastal regions. Wahabism, which arose in Nejd about the middle of the eighteenth century, is not, however, a heresy, but an ascetic revivalist movement among Moslems who sympathize with the strict but orthodox Hanbali school of Sunnism. Its founder preached reversion to the practice of the primitive church of the Prophet's days: sup pression of pagan practices; freedom from all contamination with infidels or with men (like the Turks) already contaminated by infidel intercourse; and a regimen which would keep men ever mindful of spiritual things. It early developed militancy and assumed a nationalist character. Early in the nineteenth century the Wahabites held the Holy Cities and the greater part of Arabia, but were overthrown by Egyptian forces acting for the Sultan of Turkey. Subsequently Wahabism lost some of its rigour and militancy, but there has been a distinct revival during the last two or three years among the subjects of the Emir of Nejd, who is now regarded as its leader. The puritanical and intolerant Wahabites are much disliked by their easy-going neighbours in Hejaz and Hasa. The great annual pilgrimage from all parts of the Moslem world to Mecca and Medina has an important bearing on politics, economy, and popular character in the peninsula. It accounts in normal times for an annual influx of nearly half a million persons into Hejaz. The majority of the foreign pilgrims arrive by sea at the port of Jeddah. All pilgrims visit Mecca, \ third go to Medina. Their passage is theRACE, LANGUAGE, AND RELIGION 17 occasion for much trade, and also leads to trouble with the Bedouins, and therefore to constant unrest. It is impossible to separate politics from religion in Arabia, and the authority of several of the leading princes is religious as well as temporal. Personal sanctity is the basis of the power of the Imam of Yemen, who is regarded as having inherited infallibility and esoteric knowledge by descent from the Prophet. The Zeidis, like other Shiahs, hold that a true Caliph must be of the Prophetic seed in order to possess those innate supernatural qualities which their instinct for incarnationism demands in the leader of the faithful. The Imam accordingly is disposed to live as a sacrosanct being apart from his people. The Sherif of Mecca on the other hand does not claim personal sanctity of .the Shiite Imam type, though he is of great consideration throughout the Moslem world. So far as the basis of his power is religious, it rests on reverence for his descent merely, not for innate divine qualities in his person, and also on respect for one entrusted with such holy functions as are his by right. The King of Hejaz, as the present Sherif is now called, is ex officio chief of the Prophets own tribe, the Qoreish, and Keeper of the Holy Places. In Hejaz and southern Arabia there is a numerous religious aristocracy consisting of Sherifs and Seyyids, all of whom claim descent from Mohammed or his family. They are looked upon as the religious leaders of the people, and are generally regarded with respect. In Hadhramaut they own a large proportion of the land, but employ slaves or hired labourers to cultivate it. Manners and Customs The physical conditions of the peninsula compel a large pro portion of the inhabitants to be nomadic, and even the settled population is affected by the social features of desert life. Most of the townsmen and villagers, who usually have to pass their goods through the domains of the Bedouins, and therefore to cultivate relations with them, are more manly and independent than those of Egypt and Syria, where they might easily pass as Bedouins. There is much intermarriage moreover between the Bedouins and the settled Arabs, and many of the sheikhs of the former own residences and landed property among the latter. Owing to the virtual impossibility of increasing the food-producing18 ARABIA area^ the surplus population is driven to emigration^ which has taken place on a considerable scale to Egypt^ Syria, Mesopotamia, East Africa, the East Indian Islands, &amp;c. In most parts of Arabia the incautious and inexperienced traveller is liable to be robbed or killed by the tribesmen. The most necessary precaution is to provide himself with a raflq, i. e, a companion derived from the tribe through whose range he must pass, or from some tribe allied with it or authorized to share its range. If possible the raflq should be a man of importance, whose face will be instantly recognized by the tribesmen, and he should be kept well to the fore, in case of sudden attack. The efficiency of the raflq system is based on the recognition that a particular range, or dlra, belongs to each tribe, or even to each main section of a tribe. All Arab society is patriarchal, and some one man can answer for each unit, and among the best Arabs for very large units. The presence of a raflq is of course valueless if the tribes concerned happen to be at war with each other. Every tribe has a recognized right to raid any other tribe according to a well- established code of warfare, unless barred by a definite federation, treaty, or ancient friendship. To go out on raid (ghazwah) is the young man's chance of proving himself, and to provide him with that opportunity is almost obligatory on all self-respecting tribes. When raiders swoop down on the traveller's party, the latter, unless decidedly superior in numbers or equipment, should submit at once, in which case they may expect to be robbed but not killed. Such submission is the recognized procedure, and entails no slur on the courage of the party attacked. Most Arab towns, and even villages, are surrounded by walls of dried earth, occasionally flanked by towers of similar construc tion. The streets are narrow, irregular, and seldom parallel. Near the market-place are usually the chief mosque and the residence of the Emir, or Governor. Whitewash is sometimes used on the houses in Hejaz, Yemen, and Oman, but otherwise the yellowish colour of the sun-dried bricks predominates, baked bricks being unknown, and stone buildings rare except in the southern highlands. In the Yemen Tihamah the dwellings of the poorer classes are constructed of palm and other branches. The principal feature of the interior of an Arab house is the qahwah, or coffee-room. It is a large apartment spread with mats, and sometimes furnished with carpets and a few cushions. AtMANNERS AND CUSTOMS 19 one end is a small furnace or fireplace for preparing coffee, which is served at all hours of the day. In this room the men congregate, and guests are received and even lodged. The Arabs on the whole are hospitable, and the stranger is usually entertained by one of the wealthier members of the community. Mutton or poultry is often provided in addition to rice, bread, and vegetables, but butter and spices are used too freely in Arab cookery for the European taste. The chief meal of the day is taken after sunset, and the Arabs are not as a rule gluttonous. Smoking is universal except jvhere forbidden by the Wahabites, who sometimes punish it with death. Slavery is a recognized institution throughout Arabia, and Abyssinian slave-girls are with difficulty still obtained. Formerly the slaves were brought from many parts of eastern Africa, but the source of supply was all but closed by the end of the nineteenth century. They are still largely used in domestic service, are generally well treated, and have readily embraced the Mohammedan religion. Arab masters frequently enfranchise their slaves, many of whom rise to positions of importance. There is practically no racial prejudice against negroes, and in southern Arabia there has been so much intermarriage that almost every family has a strain of African blood. Economic Capacity of Inhabitants Arabia does not produce much beyond its own food-supply, and not even all of that. It imports in fact large quantities of its own chief food staples, dates and coffee, although both of these are also exported in smaller quantities. Agriculture is possible only in a small proportion of the total area of the peninsula. Elsewhere men can exist only by raising animals which thrive on thin and evanescent vegetation, and the Bedouin societies living under these conditions are naturally not self-supporting, but are dependent on the outer world both for necessaries and for any sort of luxuries. Clothing materials, coffee, tobacco, arms and ammunition can reach them in most cases only from ports or from the settled districts on the fringes of Arabia. The power therefore which controls such districts, and has command of the sea, can always exercise an influence on the tribes, and in the long run control their behaviour and punish their hostility. â¢i20 ARABIA Exports from Hejaz and Asir are insignificant, the most impor tant being hides and skins. Those of Yemen include coffee, fodder, kat, hides and skins, firewood and charcoal, live-stock, eggs, vegetables, sesame-oil, &amp;c. Much of the Yemen trade passes through Aden, which is the chief centre of Arabian trade with Africa, and a great distributing centre for European and Asiatic commerce. The total value of its trade in 1913-14 was Â£8,530^000^ but the inland trade accounted for only a small fraction of this sum. The exports of Oman amount in normal years to about Â£300,000; dates, which are sent to India and America, are the most important, and among others are pearls and mother-of-pearl. The pearl-fisheries of the Persian Gulf are very valuable, and are carried on from Koweit, the coast of Hasa, Bahrein, Qatar, and Trucial Oman; the value of the pearls from Bahrein alone amount to about Â£2,000,000 in a good year. The oases of Hasa export dates, mats, hides, donkeys, &amp;c., but there are practically no exports from central Arabia, where the oases are less productive than those of Hasa, and the manufactures are of the most primitive kind. No part of Arabia can be called an industrial country, but there are several small industries of considerable importance in the south and east. Weaving is carried on in the settled coastal districts from Yemen to Hasa. In the former country, chiefly at Hodeidah, the weavers make a coarse cotton cloth in stripes of colour, which is retailed in lengths suitable for shawls, &amp;c., as worn by the natives. The weavers of Hofuf and Bahrein manu facture fine abbas of wool, silk, or cotton, often enriched with embroidery of good design and borders of gold thread. Boats or dhows are built at various places along the south western coasts, and in the Persian Gulf at Bahrein and Koweit. The Yemen dhow âused for transporting cargo to and from vessels in the roadsteadâis about fifty feet long and sharp-prowed, and takes about three months to build. The stem and stern posts and the knees and ribs are made of native acacia, but the planking comes from the Malabar coast. Sea-going dhows are built on the same lines, but are larger. Dyeing is practised throughout southern Arabia, and the indigo plant is cultivated for this purpose, but the industry has languished owing to an increasing tendency to use synthetic dyes. Hides are tanned and made into sandals at Hodeidah and other places in the Yemen Tihamah, while in the interior sheep-skins are soft-ECONOMIC CAPACITY OF INHABITANTS 21 tanned for making into boots. There is a small flour-mill at Menakhah, built by the Turks, but otherwise grinding is done by the hand-quern. There are skilled native workers in brass and copper at San'a^ and also in Hasa and Oman, and at Muscat gold and silver work is produced by Indian workmen. Palm leaves, imported from the coast of Eritrea^ are manufactured into mats in the neighbourhood of Aden, Somali women being particularly expert in such work; beds, plates, baskets, sacks, and many other articles are made of strips of this matting, which is also largely used for the building of sheds and the roofing of houses. The natives of Bahrein, who are skilled workers in various directions, make mats out of reeds imported from Hasa. Other native industries are sail-making at Bahrein, the manufacture of daggers in Trucial Oman, and cotton-spinning, string-making, and dis tilling (from dates) in the Aden Protectorate. Distribution and Density of Population The population of Arabia cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy, but the following figures are believed to be approxi mately correct : Hejaz 1,000,000; Asir 1,500,000; Yemen 1,000,000; Aden and Hinterland 500,000; Hadhramaut 150,000; Sultanate of Oman 500,000; Trucial Oman 80,000; Qatar 25,000; Bahrein 100,000; Hasa 150,000; Koweit 50,000. These figures include both the settled and the nomadic population, and in the case of Hejaz five-sixths are nomads, most of whom range for part of the year in the central deserts to the east of the province. In addition to the above, the settled population of Nejd is estimated at 250,000, and that of Jebel Shammar at 20,000, while the Bedouins of the central north, east, and south possibly number half a million. These estimates give a total of rather less than six millions. No part of Hejaz is thickly populated. Its deserts are the home of great Bedouin tribes, such as the Harb and the Ateibah, while the chief tribes of Midian are the Huweitat and the Beni 'Atiyah. Mecca, the largest town in Arabia, has a permanent population of about 70,000, including 12,000 Indians. The in habitants of Medina, not including the cultivators of the surrounding oasis, number 40,000, and those of Jeddah 30,000. The settled population is much more numerous in Asir, where the main constituent is a highland farmer element, living in the22 ARABIA upper wadis on both flanks of the main ridge, and only in a few places collected into urban settlements of any size. Qunfudah on the coast and Muha'il, Rijal^ Khamis Musheit, Ibha_, and Sabia inland may be called towns, and there are many large villages where the local trade is focussed; but the available descriptions of inland settlements suggest not towns, but villages with chains of dependent farmsteads and groups of huts distributed along the valley-bottoms and sides. In the last century Wadi Bishah was said to possess sixty villages, and the number has not decreased. As in Nejran^ the Jauf of Yemen, and Hadhramaut^ these settle ments serve as nuclei of tribes with fringes of unsettled clans, which roam the intervening steppes and mountain heights in search of pasturage. The Yemen highlands are the most populous part of Arabia. The inhabitants for the most part are settled and occupied in agri culture or trade, for the conditions which produce the pastoral or Bedouin type hardly exist. The majority live in close-set villages, which in many parts of the country lie within hail of each other in a continuous series, while great tracts of mountain land are intensively cultivated. The organization of society is tribal, the most numerous tribal groups being the Hashid wa Bekil in the north-east, the Khaulan east and south of San'a, and the Zaranik in the Tihamah. To the east of the highlands is a scattered pastoral population, but the Great Desert, stretching from Yemen to Oman and from Hadhramaut to Nejd, is, so far as is known, totally uninhabited. The population of San'a, the capital of Yemen, has decreased in recent years owing to famine and commercial depression caused by the long warfare between Turks and Arabs; at the present time its inhabitants probably number about 20^000. Hodeidah is believed to have over 40,000, Menakhah 7,000^ and Ta'izz, Yerim, Dhamar, and Ibb about 4,000 each. The Settlement of Aden comprises the following divisions: (1) the peninsula and isthmus, or Aden proper, which has an area of about twenty-one square miles and a population (in 1915) of 36,900; (2) Sheikh 'Othman and the surrounding district, in clusive of the villages of c Imad and Hiswah, which has an area of thirty-nine square miles and a population of 7,700; (3) Little Aden peninsula, with fifteen square miles of area and a population of 330; and (4) the island of Perim, with five square miles of area and a population of 1,300. The total area of the Settlement isDISTRIBUTION AND DENSITY OF POPULATION 23 therefore about eighty square miles^ with a total population of just over 46^000. Aden Protectorate proper has an area of about 4^200 square miles and a population of 100^000. In Oman the Batinah coastal strip contains several populous towns and villages^ of which Sohar, Barkah^ and Sib are the best known. The most populous valley^ however, is the Wadi Sema'il. Sema^il itself, an important settlement in the wadi, is not a single compact town, but a group of twelve adjoining unwalled villages, extending along the valley for ten miles, with an average breadth of one mile. In the north-western district of Jau is the fertile Bireimi oasis, which supports a population of over 5,000. The population of Muscat fluctuates in numbers, for in the hot weather more than half the inhabitants seek a less trying climate in the Batinah, but in winter, when the town is full, its total population numbers about 10,000, of whom some 3,000 reside within the walls. The population of Trucial Oman, i.e. the coastal region from Ras Musandam to Qatar, is for the most part settled, the chief towns being Sharjah, with 15,000 inhabitants, Dibai, with nearly 20,000, and Abu Dhabi, with over 6,000. The interior of Qatar is practically unknown, but the two principal settlements on the coast are Dohah, with about 12,000, and Wakrah, with about 8,000 inhabitants. The small islands of Bahrein are thickly populated, and are estimated to support approximately 60,000 townsmen and 40,000 villagers, the most important towns being Manamah and Budeyya* on Bahrein Island, and Muharraq and Hadd on the smaller Muharraq Island. Two-thirds of the popu lation of the Hasa province are settled, and the great majority inhabit the rich oases of Qatif and Hasa, the largest town of the latter being Hofuf. The nomadic population comprises 35,000 of the c Ajman tribe, who at certain seasons wander outside the limits of the province. The settled population of the Sultanate of Koweit is estimated at about 37,000, but is practically all resident in Koweit itself, though the barren territory of the Sultanate extends over an area of more than 20,000 square miles. There is only a very small nomadic element in Nejd proper, and the great Bedouin tribes which owe allegiance to its emir range either outside its boundaries or only for a short distance and very occasionally within them. Such are the Ahl Murrah^ Beni Khalid, and c Ajman on the east, the Qahtan on the south and south-west, and the Sebei' and Sahul on the west. Riyadh,24 ARABIA the capital, is a small town with probably less than 10_,000 inhabitants. The only populous district of central Arabia is Qasinx, which consists of a section, about 100 miles in length, of the Wadi Rummah depression, and has a settled population of about 50,000. The number of settlements of urban and village rank in Qasim is over fifty, and among these are two towns, Boreidah and Aneizah, which have over 10,000 inhabitants each, while Rass has some 3,500. The settled folk of Jebel Shammar, about 4,000 of whom live in Ha/il, are concentrated between Jebel Aja and Jebel Selmah. The Bedouins who recognize the present Emir of Ha'il do not exceed 20,000 in number, and consist of the pastoral sections of the Shammar tribe.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000239.0x0001d5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/16/4</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000239.0x0001d5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/16/4</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Arabia'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1919/1919</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-15T00:23:45</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (14 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: there is a foliation sequence, which is circled in pencil, in the top right corner of the recto of each folio.
