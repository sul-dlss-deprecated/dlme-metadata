(Memoeandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.) The incidents which have given rise to the Jewish complaints and to ques tions in Parliament are described in the following communique, which was issued by the Palestine Government on the 26th of September last :— On the evening of the 23rd September, the eve of the Day of Atonement, a complaint was made to the Deputy District Commissioner, Jerusalem, by the Mutawali of the Abu Madian Waqf, in which the pavement and the whole area around the Western or W T ailing Wall is vested, to the effect that a dividing screen had been fixed to the pavement adjoining the Wall, and that other innova tions had been made in the established practice, such as the introduction of additional petrol lamps, a number of mats, and a .tabernacle or ark much larger than was customary. The Deputy District Commissioner visited the W^all during the evening service, and, acting in accordance with the practice estab lished by Government, decided that the screen would have to be removed before the service on the following day. He gave instructions accordingly to the beadle in charge of the arrangements for the conduct of the services at the Wall, reserving his decision in the matter of the lamps, the mats, and the ark. The beadle undertook to remove the screen and the Deputy District Commissioner gave him until early the following morning to do so. The Deputy District Com missioner accepted the beadle's assurance that his instructions would be carried out, at the same time informing the British Police Officer on duty that in the event of the beadle not complying with his undertaking the screen was to be removed. On the following morning the Police Officer visited the Wall and, finding that the screen had not been removed, asked members of the congregation pre sent to take it away ; they replied that they were unable to move it because of the holiness of the day. The Police therefore removed the screen themselves. The worshippers in general, unaware of the circumstances that had gone before and seeing only the Police in the act of removing the screen which had been used to separate the men and the women, became excited and some of them en deavoured by force to prevent the screen being taken away. Ultimately the screen was removed. The importation of the screen and its attachment to the pavement consti tuted an infraction of the status quo, which the Government were unable to per mit. At the same time the Government deeply deplore the shock that was caused to large numbers of religious people on a day so holy to Jews. Gov ernment understand that the beadle responsible for the innovation which caused the incident has been dealt with by the Jewish authorities, and on their side have impressed on the Jewish authorities the need, manifested in connection with the incidents at the W T all in 1922 and 1925 and again on this occasion, for prior consultation with the proper officers of Government as to the arrangements for the services at the Wall on the principal Jewish holidays. No Jewish Police Officer was present at the Wall on the occasion in question owing to all Jewish Officers in Jerusalem having been excused duty for the Day of Atonement. Government will, however, consider the desirability of a res- ponsible Jewish Officer being included in future among the officers detailed for duty at the Wall on solemn Jewish holy days. In conclusion. Government consider that the removal of the screen was necessary, but regret all the circumstances attending that removal.' It will be seen that the intervention of the police was caused by an act of the Jewish authorities, which was regarded bv the Palestine Government as constituting an infraction of the status quo. Before proceeding to an explana tion of the status quo as it appears to the Palestine Government and His Majesty's Government, it is necessary to state briefly the position as it existed before the British Administration was set up in Palestine. I^he Western or Wailing Wall formed part of the western exterior of the ancient Jewish Temple ; as such it is holy to the Jewish community, and their2 custom of praying there extends back to the Middle Ages and possibly further. The Wall is also part of the Haram-al-Sharif ; as such, it is holy to Moslems. Moreover, it is legally the absolute property of the Moslem community, and the strip of pavement tacing it is Waqf property, as is shown by documents preserved by the guardian of the Waqf. The Jewish community have established an un doubted right of access to the pavement for the purposes of their devotions but, whenever protests were made by the Moslem authorities, the Turkish authorities repeatedly ruled they would not permit such departures from the existing practice as the bringing of chairs and benches to the pavement. It is understood that a ruling prohibiting the bringing of screens to the pavement was given in 1912. The Palestine Government and His Majesty's Government, having in mind the terms of Article 13 of the Mandate for Palestine, have taken the view that the matter is one in which they are bound to maintain the status quo, which they have regarded as being, in general terms, that the Jewish community have a right of access to the pavement for the purposes of their devotions, but may bring to the W all only those appurtenances of worship which were permitted under the Turkish regime. Whenever the Moslem authorities have preferred complaints that innovations have been made in the established practice, and the Palestine Government on enquiry have satisfied themselves that the complaints were well founded, they have felt it their duty to insist that the departures from practice which gave rise to the complaints should be discontinued. An incident which occurred in September, 1925, when the authorities in Palestine had to remove seats and benches brought to the Wall, formed' one of the subjects of a memorandum addressed by the President of the Zionist Orga nisation through His Majesty's Government to the League of Nations in May, 1926. The conclusion of both the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Coun cil of the League was that a solution of the difficulties could only be found by agree ment, thus endorsing the comment of His Majesty's Government on the memoran dum which was that the dispute could not be settled except by common consent. The Palestine Government, though prepared, if approached by both parties, to act as intermediaries, felt that the matter was one which could best be settled by consent between the communities concerned. Neither party, in fact, % approached the Palestine Government and that Government is not aware of any negotiations having been initiated between the parties. From the official communique issued by the Palestine Government it will be seen—and, so far as His Majesty's Government are aware, the fact is not contested—that on the Jewish Day of Atonement in September last innovations were made in the existing practice. Complaints about these innovations were made to an officer of the Palestine Government by the Mutawali of the Waqf in which the pavement is vested, and, when on investigation he found that those complaints were substantiated, he was confronted with a choice between ignoring the Mandatory obligation of His Government to preserve the status quo and the removal of an appurtenance of Jewish worship. Having decided that the Man datory obligation could not be disregarded, he obtained from the Jewish officials present at the Wall an undertaking that the screen which had been introduced in contravention of established practice would be removed before the service on the Day of Atonement. Unfortunately, this undertaking w T as not fulfilled ; and accordingly there was no alternative, bearing in mind the obligation to preserve the status quo, to the removal of the screen when, on the following morninc:, worshippers present at the Wall themselves declined to remove it. Though some of the congregation endeavoured to prevent it, the removal was in fact effected without casualties of any but a light nature. The Police who undertook this duty did not include any Jews ; at one time it was the practice to post a Jewish police inspector near the Wailing Wall on Jewish holy days but, at the urgent request of the Chief Rabbinate, all Jewish police 'officers had been . excused dutv on the Day of Atonement. In future, steps will be taken to ensure * that a Jewish officer is present at the Wall on all such occasions. It has been urged that the Palestine Government should have exercised greater judgment and, in particular, should have consulted representative Jewish authorities before action was taken. His Majesty's Government feel that the delicacy of the question of procedure at the Wall and the nelM for extreme discretion with regard to anything that might be regarded by watchful3 7~X tieighhonrs as a 'breacli of the status quo should have been obvious to the res- possible Jewish authorities. Those authorities are fully aware that, in the absence of any mutual agreement between themselves and the Moslem autho- rites regulating the conduct of services at the Wall, it is open to the Moslem authorities to take exception to any innovations of practice, and it is the duty of the Palestine Government to ensure that there is no infraction of the status quo. If the innovations introduced on the Jewish Day of Atonement were made with the assent of the responsible Jewish authorities, that assent must be assumed to have been given in the full knowledge that, since the permission of the Government and of the Moslem owners of the pavement had not been ob tained, the departure from the status quo would have to be stopped by Govern ment if complaint were made. The Jewish authorities should have been the more alert to the possibility .that the Moslem authorities would complain against any departure from the status quo on the Jewish Day of Atonement, since such a complaint was, in fact, made on the same day in 1925, and, after the police had intervened to restore the status quo, it had been made clear to those concerned that the Palestine Government would regard it as their duty to take similar actioi} in the event of any recurrence. If, on the other hand the responsible Jewish authorities were not aware of the innovations introduced on the Jewish Day of Atonement, they cannot rea sonably expect the Mandatory Administration to countenance the unauthorised act of a subordinate. In any case, responsible officer of the Palestine Govern ment was faced with a position callingfor an immediate decisionand the principles on which he acted cannot, in the view of His Majesty's Government, be called into question. In the light of subsequent events, it may be thought unfortunate that the Deputy District Commissioner relied on the undertaking given by the Jewish official present at the Wall that the screen would be removed ; but he had no rea son to suppose that that undertaking would not in fact be carried out. It has been represented that the removal of the screen should have been post poned until the conclusion of the services and the Fast of the Day of Atonement. It must be pointed out in reply that it is the practice to take immediate action where it is established that the status quo has been infringed. In the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other Holy Places, even in the most sacred services and upon the most holy days, infraction of the status quo lias from time immemorial been dealt with immediately and on the spot owing to the risk of creating a precedent which would transform an infraction into an integral portion of the status quo. The request has been preferred to His Majesty's Government that they should use their good offices ' to promote an arrangement eliminating the pre sent obstacles to the free exercise of worship ' at the Wailing Wall. His Majesty's Government regard it as their duty, and it is their intention, to main tain the established Jewish right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for the purposes of their devotions and also their right to bring to the Wall those appurtenances that they were allowed to take to the Wall under the Turkish regime. It would be inconsistent with their duty under the Mandate were they to endeavour to compell the Moslem owners of the pavement to accord any further privileges or rights to the Jewish communitv. The possibility that such privileges or rights might be acquired by the Jews by mutual arrangement with the Moslem authorities has been lessened by the fact that public opinion in Palestine has definitely removed the matter from the purely religious orbit and has made of it a political and racial question. Even if the dispute had not assumed this complexion, it would have been difficult to find a solution satisfac tory to all parties concerned. In the present state of feeling the difficulty has been greatly enhanced. Nevertheless, in the hope that more sober counsels will eventually prevail the Palestine Government have suggested both to the Pales tine Zionist Executive and to the Supreme Moslem Council that it would be a convenience to all parties concerned if a protocol could be mutually agreed upon between the Moslem and Jewish authorities regulating the conduct of the services at the Wall without prejudice to -the legal rights of the Moslem owners and in such a way as to satisfy normal liturgical requirements and decencies in matters of public worship. The Government have also instructed a senior officer to sound both parties in a tentative manner, in order to ascertain if some such arrangement can be achieved. If satisfactory assurances are received on thispoint, the Palestine Government will be most ready and anxious to use their good offices to facilitate such an arrangement. His Majesty's Government for their part, would cordially welcome any arrangement which, while enabling them to fulfil their Mandatory obligation to preserve all existing rights in con nection with the Wailing Wall, would provide a solution of the question satis factory to both parties concerned and prevent the recurrence of such unfortu nate incidents as occurred in September last.

Until order lias been more completely restored it is difficult to offer any full explanation of the causes of the disturbances. At the instance of Die Secretary of State instructions have already been issued by the Palestine Government for the collection of evidence before it disappears as to whether the events beginning on Friday, the 23rd August, were spontaneous or preconcerted. Pending the collection and review of such evi dence a discussion of this aspect of the question would be unprofitable. It will be remembered, however, that in his statement before the Perma nent Mandates Commission on the 5th July Sir John Chancellor had expressed the opinion as regards relations between the Jews and Arabs that the position was improving and that the Arabs were showing willingness to co-operate on such terms as the Mandatory Power was able to offer them. To turn now to the events immediately pre ceding the outbreak of disturbances, the follow ing outstanding incidents are of special signi ficance :— 1. On Thursday, the 15th August the Jewish commemoration of the Destruction of the Temple passed off quietly, every possible precaution having been taken to preserve order to avoid collisions, the only exceptional feature being a demonstration at the Wall by a few hundreds of young Jews from Tel Aviv and elsewhere, to whom, in view of the Jewish right of access, it would have been difficult, especially on such a solemn occasion, to deny access to the Wall. 2. On the following day, the 16th August, a demonstration by a large body of Arabs took place at the Wailing Wall, where, however, they remained only for a few minutes. During this demonstration papers containing Jewish prayers and petitions, which had been placed in crevices in the Wall in accordance with the old local custom, were burned. The Grand Mufti had promised to endeavour to keep Moslems within the Ilaram area, but it was not thought practic able without endangering the public peace to deny Moslems access to the pavement by the Wailing Wall, which is part of the property of a Moslem pious foundation. Arrangements were of course made for the maintenance of public order in the neighbourhood. This incident led to considerable excitement between Moslems and Jews in Jerusalem and elsewhere. Jewish feel ing on the subject of the burning of the prayers and petitions ran high, and the efforts of the Officer Administering the Government to guide it into prudent channels were rendered difficult by the absence of all responsible secular Jewish leaders from the country owing to the Zurich Congress. 3. On the 17th August, a Jew, stated to have been found trespassing, was fatally stabbed by an Arab, and an Arab was beaten by some Jews. These incidents were not at the time considered to be closely connected with the occurrence noted above, though they were of course evidence of the tension between the two races. 4. On the 21st August local disturbances occur red in Jerusalem in connection with the funeral of the Jew last referred to. 5. On Friday, the 23rd August, Arab ruffians commenced to run riot through the old and new cities and serious disturbances developed. No official information is at present available as to who struck the first blow. On the same day the Officer Administering the Government took im mediate steps to obtain reinforcemenis from out side Palestine, the first detachment arriving from Egypt by air within a few hours of the receipt of the call for help. Disorder very quickly began to spread outside Jerusalem, various attacks being reported to have taken place on outlying colonies during the night of the 23rd 124th. On the morning of the 24th detachments of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force were posted at Allenby Bridge and Jisr Majamie to check possible incursions into Pales tine from Trans-Jordan, to guard the Rutenberg works and watch over Jewish colonies in Beisan and the Jezreel valley. Thus it will be seen that the Palestine Government had already called for military assistance from outside Palestine in anticipation of the spread of disturbances -outside the immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem, but before they were actually reported, and that on the next morning detach ments of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force were already in position at specially vulnerable points. The rapid spread of disorder, accompanied in many cases by the slaughter of defenceless Jews, has been fully reported in the press, and as full information as possible from official sources has been published in view of the circulation of alarming reports from un-official sources, the full accuracy of which it is not yet possible to verify. The nature of the country and the isolated position of many of the Jewish colonies in the midst of an Arab population greatly outnumber ing them has rendered the task of affording pro tection at once prompt and adequate extremely difficult. It 'was accordingly thought necessary to supplement the reinforcements obtained from Egypt by further troops from Malta, and by the landing of naval detachments from the warships which were promptly sent to the Palestine coast. Particulars of the forces operating in Palestine in addition to the local police and T. J. F. F. are given below. It may now be said that the disorders on a large scale appear to have been checked, and that unless conditions should be changed by cir cumstances not at present to be foreseen the grave situation of the previous five days may be re garded as under control. Special steps have already been taken for the trial of offenders and special legislation to facili tate such trials is being enacted. 5 Warships—Barham, Sussex, Courageous, Wandere and Veteran, 3 battalions of infantry, 1 squadron armoured cars (lancers), 2^ sections armoured cars (R.

(1) Proposal that Hebrew ex-soldiers and other staunch persons should be armed. On the 24th August the Officer Administering the Government reported as follows :— The Jewish organisations are bringing strong pressure to bear on me to arm Hebrew ex-soldiers and other staunch persons and they are charging the Government with weakness for not having done this hitherto. While the feeling of the Jewish organisations is easily understood, my advisers and I feel that where it is possible to afford a measure of protection to menaced settle ments, a step such as that proposed would so inflame the whole Arab population of Palestine and Trans-Jordan that the danger to the Jews would be greatly increased and a general rising might be caused. In this view the Officer Com manding, R. A. F. concurs. The prompt arrival of troops from Egypt will, it may be hoped, give the Jews the necessary defence without our having to incur the risk which their arming would occasion. In his reply the Secretary of State noted the 0. A. G.'s views on the general question of arm ing Hebrew ex-soldiers and referred to repre sentations made by Mr. Sacher of th© Zionist Executive urging the need for arming Jewish colonists in places where they would not be given protection and suggesting their being placed under discipline as special constables or other wise. The Secretary of State left the final deci sion to the Officer Administering the Govern ment, with the instruction that the matter must be viewed in the light of any advice given by the Officer Commanding the Troops. Rumours appear to have been current in Moslem circles that the Government had armed the Jews, but this is not the case, the Officer Ad ministering the Government has given a formal assurance to Moslems to that effect. (2) Disarming of Jews. While, as will be seen above, the Government was accused in Moslem quarters of arming the Jews, allegations were received on the other hand that the Government was confiscating aims in the possession of Jews and forbidding self- defence under pain of arrest. The ascertained facts are as follows :— On the 23rd and 24th August the Government put into force the emergency provisions of the Police Ordinance under which, inter alia, any person found in any public place in possession of a weapon which might be used in a disturb ance is liable to arrest without warrant and to certain penalties. This provision is of course applicable to all sections of the population. At an early stage of the disturbances special constables were enrolled, and armed by the police^ and of these a number were Jewish. On the 27th of August, following on representations from a Moslem deputation to the effect that in this respect the assurance of the Government that it had not armed the Jews was inaccurate, the Officer Administering the Goverrmenl gave orders for the Jewish special constables to be disarmed. This action was taken with the con currence of his civil and military advisers. The Officer Administering the Government re ports that the decision was an unpalatable one to take in view of its apparent harshness to the individuals whom it affected, but there can be no doubt that it was taken on an unassailable principle and was in the best interests of the Jews as a whole since it removed an important irritant of the whole Arab population both in Palestine and Trans-Jordan. While anxiety to be armed by the Government of the Jews in Palestine many of whom have been subjected dm lug the last lew days to bloodthirsty and ruthless attacks on their lives and property and many of whom are also unarmed is natural, the (Officer Administering the Government considers that the Jewish leaders in taking a short as against a long view seem to have failed to appre ciate the greater danger to the Jewish popula tion and the whole country which would have arisen if their request had been granted. LC597FD—250—11 -10-29—GIFSTHE WESTERN OR WAILING WALL IN JERUSALEM. (Memobandum by ihe Seceetaey of State foe the Colonies.) The incidents which have given rise to the Jewish complaints and to ques tions in Parliament are described in the following communique, which was issued by the Palestine Government on the 2Gth of September last :— On the evening of the 23rd September, the eve of the Day of Atonement, a complaint was made to the Deputy District Commissioner, Jerusalem, by the Mutawali of the Abu Madian Waqf, in which the pavement and the whole area around the Western or Wailing W r all is vested, to the effect that a dividing- screen had been fixed to the pavement adjoining the Wall, and that other innova tions had been made in the established practice, such as the introduction of additional petrol lamps, a number of mats, and a .tabernacle or ark much larger than was customary. The Deputy District Commissioner visited the W T all during the evening service, and, acting in accordance with the practice estab lished by Government, decided that the screen would have to be removed before the service on the following day. He gave instructions accordingly to the beadle in charge of the arrangements for the conduct of the services at the Wall, reserving his decision in the matter ot the lamps, the mats, and the ark. 1 he beadle undertook to remove the screen and the Deputy District Commissioner gave him until early the following morning to do so. The Deputy District Com missioner accepted the beadle's assurance that his instructions would be carried out, at the same time informing the British Police Officer on duty that in the event of the beadle not complying with his undertaking the screen was to be removed. On the following morning the Police Officer visited the Wall and, finding that the screen had not been removed, asked members of the congregation pre sent to take it away ; they replied that they were unable to move it because of the holiness of the day. The Police therefore removed the screen themselves. The worshippers in general, unaware of the circumstances that had gone before and seeing only the Police in the act of removing the screen which had been used to separate the men and the women, became excited and some of them en deavoured by force to prevent the screen being taken away. Ultimately the screen was removed. The importation of the screen and its attachment to the pavement consti tuted an infraction of the status quo, which the Government were unable to per mit. At the same time the Government deeply deplore the shock that w^s caused to large numbers of religious people on a day so holy to Jews. Gov ernment understand that the beadle responsible for the innovation which caused the incident has been dealt with by the Jewish authorities, and on their side have impressed on the Jewish authorities the need, manifested in connection with the incidents at the Wall in 1922 and 1925 and again on this occasion, for prior consultation with the proper officers of Government as to the arrangements for the services at the Wall on the principal Jewish holidays. No Jewish Police Officer was present at the Wall on the occasion in question owing to all Jewish Officers in Jerusalem having been excused duty for the Day of Atonement. Government will, however, consider'the desirability of a res ponsible Jewish Officer being included in future among the officers detailed for duty at the Wall on solemn Jewish holy days. In conclusion. Government consider that the removal of the screen was necessary, but regret all the circumstances attending that removal.' It will be seen that the intervention of the police was caused by an act of the Jewish authorities, which was regarded bv the Palestine Government as constituting an infraction of the status quo. Before proceeding to an explana tion of the status quo as it appears to the Palestine Government and His Majesty's Government, it is necessary to state briefly the position as it existed before the British Administration was set up in Palestine. The Western or Wailing Wall formed part of the western exterior of the ancient Jewish Temple ; as such it is holy to the Jewish community, and theircustom of praying there extends back to the Middle Ages and possibly further. The Wall is also part of the Haram-al Sharif ; as such, it is holy to Moslems. Moreover, it is legally the absolute property of the Moslem community, and the strip of pavement facing it is Waqf property, as is shown by documents preserved by the guardian of the Waqf.

An incident which occurred in September, 1925, when the authorities in Palestine had to remove seats and benches brought to the Wall, formed one of the subjects of a memorandum addressed by the President of the Zionist Orga nisation through His Majesty's Government to the League of Nations in May, 1926.

Neither party, in fact, approached the Palestine Government and that Government is not aw T are of any negotiations having been initiated between the parties. From the official communique issued by the Palestine Government it will be seen—and, so far as His Majesty's Government are aware, the fact is not contested—that on the Jewish Day of Atonement in September last innovations were made in the existing practice'. Complaints about these innovations were made to an officer of the Palestine Government by the Mutawali of the Waqf in which the pavement is vested, and, when on investigation he found that those complaints were substantiated, he was confronted with a choice between ignoring the Mandatory obligation of His Government to preserve the status quo and the removal of an appurtenance of Jewish worship. Having decided that the Man datory obligation could not be disregarded, he obtained from the Jewish officials present at the Wall an undertaking that the screen which had been introduced in contravention of established practice would be removed before the service on the Day of Atonement. Unfortunately, this undertaking was not fulfilled ; and accordin'gly there was no alternative, bearing in mind the obligation to preserve the status quo, to the removal of the screen when, on the following morning, worshippers present at the Wall themselves declined to remove it. Though some of the congregation endeavoured to prevent it, the removal was in fact effected without casualties of any but a light nature. The Police who undertook this duty did not include any Jews ; at one time it was the practice to post a Jewish police inspector near the Wailing 'Wall on Jewish holy days but, at the urgent request of the Chief Rabbinate, all Jewish police officers had been excused duty on the Day of Atonement. In future, steps will be taken to ensure that a Jewish officer is present at the Wall on all such occasions. Tt has been urged that the Palestine Government should have exercised greater judgment and, in particular, should have consulted representative Jewish authorities before action was taken. His Majesty's Government feel that the delicacy of the question of procedure at the Wall and the need for extreme discretion with regard to anything that might be regarded by watchfuls neighbours as a breach of the status quo should have been obvious to the res- ponsible Jewish authorities. Those authorities are fully aware that, in the absence of any mutual agreement between themselves and the'Moslem autho- rites regulating the conduct of services at the Wall, it is open to the Moslem authorities to take exception to any innovations of practice, and it is the duty of the Palestine Government to ensure that there is no infraction of the status quo.

In any case, responsible officer of the Palestine Govern ment was faced with a position callingf or an immediate decision and the principles on which lie acted cannot, in the view of His Majesty's Government, be called into question. In the light of subsequent events, it may be thought unfortunate ihat the Deputy District Commissioner relied on the undertaking given by the Jewish official present at the Wall that the screen would be removed ; but he had no rea son to suppose that that undertaking would not in fact be carried out. It has been represented that the removal of the screen should have been post poned until the conclusion of the services and the Fast of the Day of Atonement. It must be pointed out in reply that it is the practice to take immediate action where it is established that the status quo has been infringed. In the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other Holy Places, even in the most sacred services and upon the most holy days, infraction of the status quo has from time immemorial been dealt with immediately and on the spot owing to the risk of creating a precedent which would transform an infraction into an integral portion of the status quo. The request has been preferred to His Majesty's Government that they should use their good offices ' to promote an arrangement eliminating the pre sent obstacles to the free exercise of worship ' at the Wailing Wall. His Majesty's Government regard it as their duty, and it is their intention, to main tain the established Jewish right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for the purposes of their devotions and also their right to bring to the W'all those appurtenances that they were allowed to take to the Wall under the Turkish regime. It would be inconsistent with their duty under the Mandate were they to endeavour to compell the Moslem owners of the pavement to accord any further privileges or rights to the Jewish community. The possibility that such privileges or rights might be acquired by the Jews by mutual arrangement with the Moslem authorities has been lessened by the fact that public opinion in Palestine has definitely removed the matter from the purely religious orbit and has made of it a political and racial question. Even if the dispute had not assumed this complexion, it would have been difficult to find a solution satisfac tory to all parties concerned. In the present state of feeling the difficulty has been greatly enhanced. Nevertheless, in the hope that more sober counsels will eventually prevail the Palestine Government have suggested both to the Pales tine Zionist Executive and to the Supreme Moslem Council that it would be a convenience to all parties concerned if a protocol could be mutually agreed upon between the Moslem and Jewish authorities regulating the conduct of the services at the Wall without prejudice to the legal rights of the Moslem owners and in such a way as to satisfy normal liturgical requirements and decencies in matters of public worship. The Government have also instructed a senior officer to sound both parties in a tentative manner, in order to ascertain if some such arrangement can be achieved. If satisfactory assurances are received on thispoint, the Palestine Government will be most ready and anxious to use their good'offices to facilitate such an arrangement. His Majesty's Government for their part, would cordially welcome any arrangement which, while enabling them to fulfil their Mandatory obligation to preserve all existing rights in con nection with the Wailing Wall, would provide a solution ol the question satis factory to both parties concerned and prevent the recurrence of such unfortu nate incidents as occurred in September last. Colonial Office, 19th November, 1928. %DISTURBANCES IN PALESTINE. Until order lias been more completely restored it is difficult to offer .any full explanation of the causes of the disturbances. At the instance of the Secretary of State instructions have already been issued by the Palestine Governmeflt for the collection of evidence before it disappears as to whether the events beginning on Friday, the 23rd August, were spontaneous or preconcerted. Pending the collection and review of such evi dence a discussion of this aspect' of the question would be unprofitable. It will be remembered, however, that in his statement before the Perma nent Mandates Commission on the 5th July Sir John Chancellor had expressed the opinion as regards relations between the Jews and Arabs that the position was improving and that the Arabs were showing willingness to co-operate on such terms as the Mandatory Power was able to offer them. To turn now to the events immediately pre ceding the outbreak of disturbances, the follow ing outstanding incidents are of special signi fieance :— 1. On Thursday, the 15th August the Jewish commemoration of the Destruction of the Temple passed off quietly, every possible precaution having been taken to preserve order to avoid collisions, the only exceptional feature being a demonstration at the Wall by a few hundreds of young Jews from Tel Aviv and elsewhere, to whom, in view of the Jewish right of access, it would have been difficult, especially on such a solemn occasion, to deny access to the Wall. 2. On the following day, the 16th August, a demonstration by a large body of Arabs took place at the Wailing Wall, where, however, they remained only for a few minutes. During this demonstration papers containing Jewish prayers and petitions, which had been placed in crevices in the Wall in accordance with the old local custom, were burned. The Grand Mufti had promised to endeavour to keep Moslems within the Ha ram area, but it was not thought practic able without endangering the public peace to deny Moslems access to the pavement by the Wailing Wall, which is part of the property of a Moslem pious foundation. Arrangements were of course made for the maintenance of public order in the neighbourhood. This incident led to considerable excitement between Moslems and Jews in Jerusalem and elsewhere. Jewish feel ing on the subject of the burning of the prayers and petitions ran high, and the efforts of' the Officer Administering the Government to guide it into prudent channels were rendered difficult by the absence of all responsible secular Jewish leaders from the country owing to the Zurich Congress. 3. On the 17th August, a Jew, stated to have been found trespassing, was fatally stabbed by an Aiab, and an Arab was beaten by some'Jews. These incidents were not at the time considered to be closely connected with the occurrence noted above, though they were of course evidence of the tension between the two races. 4. On the 21st August local disturbances occur red in Jerusalem in connection with the funeral or the Jew last referred to. 5. On Friday, the 23rd August, Arab ruffians commenced to run riot^through the old and new cities and serious disturbances developed. No official information is at present available as to who struck the first blow. On the same day the Officer Administering the Government took im mediate steps to obtain reinforcemenis from out side Palestine, the first detachment arriving from Egypt by air within a few hours of the receipt of the call for help. ^ Disorder very quickly began to spread outside Jerusalem, various attacks being reported to have taken place on outlying colonies during the night of the 23rdj24th. On the morning of the 24th detachments of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force were posted at Allenby Bridge and Jisr Majamie to check possible incursions into Pales tine from Trans-Jordan, to guard the Rutenberg works and watch over Jewish colonies in Beisan and the Jezreel valley. Thus it will be seen that the Palestine Government had already called for military assistance from outside Palestine in anticipation of the spread of disturbances outside the immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem, but before they were actually reported, and that on the next morning detach ments of the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force were already in position at specially vulnerable points. The rapid spread of disorder, accompanied in many cases by the slaughter of defenceless Jews, has been fully reported in the press, and as full information as possible from official sources has been published in view of the circulation of alarming reports from un-official sources, the full accuracy of which it is not yet possible to verify. The nature of the country and the isolated position of many of the Jewish colonies in the midst of an Arab population greatly outnumber ing them has rendered the task of affording pro tection at once prompt and adequate extremely difficult. It Was accordingly thought necessary to supplement the reinforcements obtained from Egypt by further troops from Malta, and by the landing of naval detachments from the warships which were promptly sent to the Palestine coast. Particulars of the forces operating in Palestine in addition to the local police and T. J. F. F. are given below. It may now be said that the disorders on a large scale appear to have been checked, and that unless conditions should be changed bv cir cumstances not at present to be foreseen the grave situation of the previous five days may be re garded as under control. Special steps have already been taken for the trial of offenders and special legislation to facili tate such trials is being enacted. ^ \\ arships—Barham, Sussex, Courageous, Wandere and Veteran, 3 battalions of infantry, 1 squadron armoured cars (lancers), 2^ sections armoured cars (R.

Two aspects of this question have arisen and will be dealt with separately. • (1) Proposal that Hebrew ex-soldiers and other staunch persons should be armed. - On the 24th August the Officer Administering the Government reported as follows :— The Jewish organisations are bringing strong pressure to bear on me to arm Hebrew t^-soldiers and other staunch persons and they are charging the Government with weakness for not having done this hitherto. While the feeling of the Jewish organisations is easily understood, my advisers and I feel that where it is possible to afford a measure of protection to menaced settle ments, a step such as that proposed would so inflame the whole Arab population of Palestine and Trans-Jordan that the danger to the Jews would be greatly increased and a general rising might be caused. In this view the Officer Com manding, R. A. F. concurs. The prompt arrival of troops from Egypt will, it may be hoped, give the Jews the necessary defence without our having to incur the risk which their arming would occasion. In his reply the Secretary of State noted the O. A. G.'s views on the general question of arm ing Hebrew ex-soldiers and referred to repre sentations made by Mr. Sacher of the Zionist Executive urging the need for arming Jewish colonists in places where they would not be given protection and suggesting their being placed under discipline as special constables or other wise. The Secretary of State left the final deci sion to the Officer Administering the Govern ment, with the instruction that the matter must be viewed in the light of any advice given by the Officer Commanding the Troops. Rumours appear to have been current in Moslem circles that the Government had armed the Jews, but this is not the case, .the Officer Ad ministering the Government has given a formal assurance to Moslems to that effect. (2) Disarming of Jews, hile, as will be seen above, the Government was accused in Moslem quarters of arming the Jews,- allegations were received on the other hand that the Government was confiscating aims in the {possession of Jews and forbidding self- defence under pain of arrest. The ascertained facts are as follows :— On the 23rd and 24th August the Government put into force the emergency provisions of the Police Ordinance under which, inter alia, any person found in any public place in possession of a weapon which might be used in a disturb ance is liable to arrest without warrant and to certain penalties. This provision is of course applicable to all sections of the population. At an early stage of the disturbances special constables were enroPed, and armed by the police? and of these a number were Jewish. On the 27th of August, following on representations from a Moslem deputation to the effect that in this respect the assurance of the Government that it had not armed the Jews was inaccurate, the Officer Administering the Goverpment gave orders for the Jewish special constables to be disarmed. This action was taken with the con currence of his civil and military advisers. The Officer Administering the Government re ports that the decision was an unpalatable one to take in view of its apparent harshness to the individuals whom it affected, but there can be no doubt that it was taken on an unassailable principle and w T as in the best interests of the Jews as a whole since it removed an important irritant of the whole Arab population both in Palestine and Trans-Jordan. While anxiety to l&gt;e armed by the Government of the Jews in Palestine many of whom have been subjected during the last few days to bloodthirsty and ruthless attacks on their lives and property and many of whom are also unarmed is natural, the Officer Administering the Government considers that the Jewish leaders in taking a short as against a long view seem to have failed to appre ciate the greater danger to the Jewish popula tion and the whole country which would have arisen if their request had been granted.

Considerable excitement has been caused amongst the Arab population and more particularly moslem element by- instruct ions/is sued on 1st October as a temporary measure to regulate observance at wailing wall, rhe agitation against those instructions took concrete form in general closure of shops and stoppage of business thFoughout Palestine yesterday. In view of the fact that local moslem authorities are telegraphing misleading descriptions of the nature and scope of whose instructions 1 think it desirable to inform you of true position. The nature and scope of those instructions were defined in official communique which T caused to be issued on 10th October and which is as follows:- Begins. In the interests of good order and decorum the nigh Commissioner has issued certain instructions to the officers of u-overnment concernec in regard to the uses of the wailing or western wall. j-hose instructions are of a temporary and provisional character,. They do not purport to define existing rights of either moslems or Jews, nor do they prejudice the rights and claims of the moslems or Jews. These instruct ions will remain in force onlyi)ending determination of existing rights by a authoritative body which His iUxcellency has requested Secretary of State to cause to be constituted for the purpose. Ends. The instructions are based on white paper of 1928. They involve no departure from status quo and confer no new privilege on Jews. The statement as to the effect of instructions is to make wailing wall into a Jews Synagogue is false.

W hereas We, taking into Our Royal consideration that there do not exist adequate means whereby We can reward important and useful services rendered to Us in Our Indian Empire in the advancement of the public interests of Our said Empire, and taking also into consideration the expediency of distinguishing such services by some mark of Our Royal favour : Now for the purpose of attaining an end so desirable as that of thus distinguishing such services as aforesaid, We have instituted and created, and by these presents for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, do institute and create a new Decoration—to be designated as hereinafter described,— and We are graciously pleased to make, ordain, and establish the following Rules and Ordinances for the government of the same which shall from henceforth be inviolably observed and kept. Firstly. —It is ordained that this Decoration shall henceforth be styled and designated ' The Kaisar-i-Hind Medal for Public Service in India.'

Seventhly. —It is ordained that the names of those persons to whom a Medal of one of these Classes may be awarded shall be published in the ' Gazette of India,' and in the Gazette of the Local Government under the jurisdiction of which the service was rendered, and shall be entered in all Civil and Official lists, and that a registry of such names shall be kept in the Office of the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India. Eighthly. —It is ordained that if any one, after having received one of the Medals, again renders such service as, if he had not received such Medal, would have entitled him to it, such further service shall be recorded by a bar attached to the ribbon by which the Medal is suspended ; and for every such additional ^service an additional bar may be added.

The Council give notice that the next award of the Sidney Prize will be made in January, 1939, the ninety-fifth anniversary of the testator's death. Dr. Swiney died in 1844, and in his will he left a sum of money to the Roy^l Society of Arts for the purpose of presenting a prize, on every fifth anniver sary of his death, to the author of the best published work on Jurisprudence. The Prize is a cup, of a value of £100, and money to the same amount. The award is made by a joint Corrrnittee of the Royal Society of Arts and the Royal College of Physicians, vhich appoints special adjudicators. The Prize is offered alternately for Medical and General Jurisprudence, but if at any time the Committee is unable to find a work of sufficient merit in the class whose turn it is to receive the award, it is at liberty to recommend a book belonging to the other class. On the last occasion of the award(1934) the Prize was awarded for General Jurisprudence. It will, therefore, be offered on the present occasicn for Medical Jurisprudence. Any person desiring to submit a work in competi tion, or to recommend any work for the consideration of the Judges, should do so by letter, addressed to the Secretary of the Society, not later than November 30th, 1938.2.

Me are thus asked to speak of one 'Thai' but of tv/o or more 'Thais' . 3, So intense is the nationalist feeling in Thailand nowadays, that offence will undoubtedly be caused by the failure to employ the new designa tions. 4, I am transmitting copies of this despatch too- The Department of Overseas Trade, the Governor -General of India, the Governor of Burma, the Governor of the Straits Settlements^ the Governor of Hong Kong, His Majesty's .embassador at Tokyoj the Admiral c ommanding-in-Chief on the China Station5 the General Officer Commanding the Troops, Malaya Command, Singapore, the % Air Vice-Marshal Commanding the Royal Air Force, Far East, Singapore, the General Officer Commanding, Burmaj the Chief of the General citaff, India, and the Naval, Military and Air Attaches, Bangkok.

Sir, . I am directed to say that in supres^j 33 } 011 o: ^ previous orders on the subject, the G-overnor-General in Council has decided that, with efioct from 3rd September 1939, the following principles govern the ^r^nt of and the incidence of the cost of leave and pension charges in respect of all civil government servants, (which term includes military officers m permanent civil employ ) other than railway servants, who have been or may be called to or employed in service jaid for fron Defence Services Estimates during the present v .ar, either in a military or in a civil capacity:- Leave (i) - All permanent civil government servants called to military duty as combatanta nill he granted leave under Part A of Army instruction (India) No. 378 of 1943. Leave of civil government servants employed with Defence Services in a civilian capacity will be governed by the civil rules applicable to tfeg-Hg their parent services in the Civil Department. Leave salary contribution, in respect of all Superior servants except Gazetted Officers of the Posts and Telegraph Department at the rates laid down in Appendix II-A of the Posts and Telegraphs Compilation of trie Fundamental and Supplementary ftules as amended from time to time or at the rates prescrifeod by respective Provincial Governments for their servants, as the esse may be, will be paid from the Defence Services Estimates. t J This cohtrioution will be calculated on the total period of service paid from the Defence Services Estimates less any period of leave granted while so employed, and will be based on tne actual pay drawn during that period. The Civil Department or Provincial Govornment concerned will bear the actual leave charges except as stated below. (i) Leave charges of personnel called to military duty for special disability leave referred to in Army Instrueion (India) No. 378 of 1943 will be borne by the Defence Services Estimates. (ii) Leave charges or all leave granted to and en- loyed by Posts md Telegraphs personnel both gazetted and non-gazetted will be i borrtfby the Defence Services Estimates. 2. No leave salary ccntrubution will be paid from the Defence Services Estimates in respect of inferior Government servants except those of the Posts and Telegraphs Department. Leave charges for leave granted to and enjoved' by inferior ser vants of all Civil Departments or Provincial Governments, during their service paid for from the Defence Services Estimates, will be bor.ne by those estimates. In addition, leave salary contr6butibn at the rate of 5 per cent, of actual jjay drawn during that period, will also be paid by the ^/ar Department in respect of inferior servants or the rosts and Telegraphs Department . This contribution will bo based on the total service rendered with the army, less any leave granted while so employed. ^ ,3. Temporary civil Government servants will be g9verned by military leave rules if employed in a military capacity, or by the appropriate civil leave rules applicable^to civilian personnel of the Defence Services, if employed in a civil capacity, and the actual leave salary will re paid irom tne Defence' Services Estimates, The question of payment of leave salary contribution does not arise in these case*. In case a temporary civil goyernment servant is made permanent in a civil post while he is in military employ he should for the purposes of leave ana leave salary contributions be treated from the date of his permanent appointment as a permanent civil goiernment servant. Pension- The pensionary liability of the Defence Services Estimates in respect of all permanent civil government servants ( other railway servants) will oe met by pay^n^ pension contributions at the rate of 12.5 vbr cent, of the pay actually drawn in the case of Posts and Telegraphs Department, at the rates laid down in Appendix II-A of the Posts and Telegraphs Compilation of tne Fundamental and SuppleDientary Rules Vol. II as amended from time to time, in the case of other Central Departments, and at the Provincial G-overnment rates in the case of permanent Provincial Govermeant servants. In the case of temporary civil Government servants who may be made permanent in civil appointments Fhils they are in service paid for from Defence Services Estimates or on reversion to their civil appointments, and who count their temporary civil service including service paid for from Defence Services ^ Estifflatdd towards pension, debits against the Defence Services Estimates in respect of temporary service paid for therefrom which may qualify for civil pension should be raised by the Civil Department or Government concerned only after the miiviauals are confirmed in their civil appointments.
