The Agreement is somewhat simpler than previous Agreements? certain unessential matter having been omitted. Longrigg writes 'Article 4 is new and emphasises that the Shaikh is a man of outstanding personality? and likely to be of real value to the Company in its future efforts to obtain access to difficult areas.

Subject :- Oil Concession in Abu Reference correspondence resting with India Office telegram No. 19 dated the 3rd January 1939 on the above subject. _ _ n s'b-tL 3. I enclose herewith a copy of a letter dated the 12th January 1939 received from Mr. Longrigg together with its enclosures. It is a matter for considerable satisfaction that Mr. Longrigg has succeeded in inducing the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to sign a concession, particularly since this followed a period when it appeared that all hope, at any rate in the current year, must be abandoned. The rea sons for the sudden change in Shaikh Shakhbufs attitude are des- cribed in paragraph 4 of Mr. Longrigg's letter of the 13th January to hio Head Office in London; and to these reasons we may perhaps add the fact that he showed to one or two of the Shaikh's relatives' the letter which I was authorised by the India Office in their tele gram quoted above to give to him. The financial terms arranged are, considering everything, extremely reasonable; and it is, I think, not too much to say that this concession should remove the major bar hitherto existing against hinterland exploration. , T I attach to this letter a statement detailing the articles in the/- 44. [FP—985 S&amp;P—(M-1597)—27-11-36—10,000. ^£ksig&amp;atwn)z- 2 - |0 the Dubai Concession corresponding to those in the concession now made with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. Generally speaking the alterations have been designed mainly to simplify phrase ology, and I need, I think, only comment in detail on the following points (a) Article 4 of the Abu Dhabi Concession. It will be observed that no payment is provided for natural gas. I had intended to enquire from Mr. Longrigg the exact reason for this, but he is unfortunately ill. The Petroleum Department will presumably be in a position to advise whether the recti fication of this omission should be insisted on or not. (b) In Article 8(c) it will be observed that, in the event of any of the Company’s foreign employees being found guilty of an offence which might lead to a breach of good order or to interference in the politics of Abu Dhabi, the Ruler may apply to the Company for his expulsion. In the corresponding article (10) in the Dubai Concession application to the Poli tical Agent is provided for. The point is perhaps of no great ' importance, since in the event of extensive exploitation being undertaken an Order-in-Council will become necessary and the essential provisions in that Order in regard to British subjects and non-Moslem foreigners will over-ride such an article as this. X (c) There is no article corresponding to No. 12 in the Dubai Concession in regard to the import of oil from adjoining territories or for pipelines through Abu Dhabi State. The presumable reason is that the Company would not erect a Refinery in Abu Dhabi territory or construct a pipeline from the hinter land across Abu Dhabi territory since there is no deep-water harbour anywhere along the Abu Dhabi coast. (d) There is no article corresponding exactly to 14(a) in the Dubai Concession. Presumably the Company consider this unnecessary/--3- unnecessary, and it seems to be a matter solely for them to decide* -V (e) There is no article corresponding to No. 21 in the Dubai Concession relating to transfer. As I understand it the absence of provision for a transfer renders a transfer impossible. It would be incumbent on the Company, if for instance they wished to effect a transfer to a foreign com pany, to relinquish their own concession and to use their good offices to induce the Shaikh to revive it in favour of the other company. In that case (or indeed, whatever pro cedure might be adopted to effect a transfer) the 1922 Agree ments, by which the Trucial Shaikhs undertook not to grant concessions for oil within their territories except with the permission of the British Government, would operate. (f) There is no provision regarding a bank (cf. Article 25 of the Dubai Concession). In this connection a reference is invited to paragraph 2(h) of your Express letter No. 55-S ^ dated the 13th January 1939 in regard to the Kalba Concession. (g) Since the Agreement has been made in Arabic and there is no equivalent to Article 27 of the Dubai Concession, there can be no question of a disagreement between the English and the Arabic versions. 4. I shall address you separately on Mr. Longrigg* s letter to you of the 12th January 1939 in which he suggests that you might be prepared to write to the Shaikh welcoming this Agree ment.January 12th, 1939 Abu Dhabi, Trucial Coast* The British Political Agent, Bahrain. Dear Sir, I have the honour to send you herewith Cl) translated copy of the Agreement concluded between my Company and the Ruler of Abu Dhabi on the 11th instant (2) copy of a letter addressed by me to my London princi pals today, containing comments on the circumstances in ; 1 which the Agreement was concluded, (3) copy of a letter from me to Sir Trenchard Fowle. These documents are all self-explanatory, but should there be any points arising out of them which you would care to discuss further, I shall be in Bahrain (in all probability) on the 16th instant and shall call upon you. I cannot help feeling very satisfied with the Abu Dhabi Agreement. With kind regards, Yours sincerely, Sd/- Stephen H. Longrigg a( 4 )/- J anuary 13 th, 1939 Abu Dhabi, Trucial Coast. Petroleum Concessions Limited, London. In continuation of my letters of Jan. 3rd (personal) to Mr. Skliros and Jan. 6th'. 2. The situation at Abu Dhabi, in the matter of obtaining a reasonable Concession, appeared very unfavour able up to the 9th. instant. The family of the Shaikh were, from behind the scenes, believed to be very anxious that he should reach agreement with the Company after pre vious failures to do so; and I did not hesitate to drop hints of generous presents to them in that event. Shaikh Shakhbut himself, however, seemed to be still fixed in demands which must put any hope of agreement completely out of sight: these, reiterated again and again, included an initial payment of Hs. 475,000 and the same sum annually thereafter; the continuance of a very high dead-rent after the payment of royalties had begun; a representative in London on a high salary; and drilling compulsory within 2 years of signature, and Royalty at the rate of Rs 3/8 per ton. 3. Needless to say evert^ possible argument was developed to show the unreasonableness of these demands, and to lead the Shaikh back to a scale more in accordance with our agree ments with other Arab rulers. 4. A sudden change in the situation, which by then appeared hopeless, occurred on the 9th, apparently in con- sequence of (1) pressure by the Shaikhs brothers and other relations, gradually wearing him down; (2) the announcement qgpfaMmmnMi of my departure within 2 days, followed by the conspicuous loading of a van with stores for Dubai; (3) the Shaikh*s hope that an agreement would be gratifying to the Political authorities, whose better opinion he would gladly have; /V e-(4) our own attitude that we really did not mind very much («Wr^r5» OT5, ' Vf ■' whether we reached agreement now or ,f in some future year', but that it seemed a pity to retard development (and the other blessings) unnecessarily. 5. The Shaikh sent intermediaries with much reduced de mands, and thereafter no particular difficulty was encountered in bringing them down to a level which made an Agreement pos sible. During the final 2 days meetings and scurryings to and fro were almost continuous. The Agreement was signed on the 11th, afternoon. 6. A translation of the Agreement is sent herewith. It will be found, I hope, not to include any obnoxious features, and the cost seems to stand comparison with the other agree ments in different parts of Arabia* 7. The Political Agent, Bahrain, is being informed; I do not anticipate that the Political authorities can have any adverse comment. In this connection I am sending you a copy of a letter which I am sending to Sir Trenchard Fowle. 8. I do not propose to take any action with regard to the tiny prindipalities of Ajman or Umm al Oaiwain. They have an independent personal position, but no territory of any possible interest to the Company; while it is certain that they would refuse to accept less than was paid to the Rulers of Sharjah or Dubai. They had therefore better be left alone. Sd/- Stephen H. Longrigg.

This point was, that, although the Company had no connection with or interest in Politics, I could not help thinking that,it would be a pleasure to you to learn that our representatives had not only had so courteou s a recep tion in Abu Dhabi but had been able to reach agreement with the Shaikh on matters so long outstanding. In dropping this hint without any authority from you to do so I was mindful of the message which reached Howes here just before he left Dubai for Abu Dhabi with the Williamson party on about November 12th — to the effect that you would be willing to restore the travel privileges of the Abu Dhabi people if they were helpful in the matter of the landing-ground. On that occasion they were not helpful; but on this, they have been. What the Shaikh would value very much, I am definitely assured, would be a letter from yourself to the effect that you are pleased to hear of our Agreement and of the good accounts given by the Company’s representatives of their kind reception at Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh would, no doubt, like to profit by this opportunity to be fully restored to favour : but about this I do not venture to say anything. I am sending a copy of this letter to Weightman. Please forgive the trouble I am giving you, and accept my best wishes for 1939* With kind regards Dhabi, of the successful outcome of which you have by Qw been Sir Trenchard Powle K.C.S.I.

I agree with Weightman that it is a matter for considerable satisfaction that Longrigg has succeeded in inducing the Shaixh of Abu Dhabi to sign this concession.

(Designation)not sure that this is correct as if Petroleum Concessions Limited definitely drop the idea of obtaining concessions from these two Shaikhs the way is open for American oil interests to take them up. 3* In regard to the A&amp;u Dhabi concession I think that the main reason for the Shaikh’s sudden change of attitude was due to the letter authorised by the India Office in their letter quoted above. I have always held the view, which I have expressed at various times, that once the Shaikhs were convinced that His Majesty’s Government were in earnest as to their 'ultimatum^ they would come to terms, and in the present instance longrigg undoubt edly adopted the correct attitude vis a vis the Shaikh of *take or leave it% as described ia paragraph 4 (4) of his letter,^' 4. In regard to yeightraan*s comments on the concession as contained in his paragraph 3, my comments are as follows8 Article 4, I suggest that the Petroleum Department be consulted* Article 8(c). The Oom .any, though they can dismiss any of their employees, have of course no legal power what ever of expulsion, (In this connection please see remarks on Article 10, paragraph 3, contained in the &amp;ote . c enclosed with India Office Printed letter Ho#P,z.6412/36 of the 23rd September 1936*} This being so and in view of the fact that it may not be possible for an Order in Council to be applied to the Trucial Coast, I think that this clause should be /altered3 SO altered to the sense of Article 10 of the Debai concession, ( c) There is no Article corresponding to No,12 in the Beb&amp;i concession. This would appear to be a technical matter on which I have no caaments. (d) There is no Article corresponding exactly to Ho, 14 (a) in the Debai concession, I agree with Weightm&amp;n that it is a matter solely for the Company to decide. (e) Ho Article corresponding to Ho.21 in the Debai concession relating to transfer. This is an important point. If Weightman is correct in his views then we need not insist on a corresponding insertion. If, however, the view expressed in paragraph 2 (g) of my Express suitable Article should be inserted. (f) Bank, I think that, as in the case of Kalb a - vide paragraph 2 (h) of my Express letter jhst quoted, a similar proviso should be inserted as in the Debai agreement. (g) Ho equivalent to Article 2? of the Debai concession. The situation does not appear to be very satisfactory. All we have at present in English is an unofficial translation by the Company. I think we should ask the Company to try and obtain an Article similar to that of the Debai concession as I foresee that without an authorised English version difficulties might arise. Attested sd.

As it stands this part of the agreement might as well have been omitted, but since it is identical with the - fc.lT) *&gt;.1^ exploration Permit granted by the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah (on thls P o;L ut), and since no objection was raised in that instance, I presume this may pass without further notice. (ii)/- S. 6. MFP— 400S&amp;P—(M-480)—26-7-34—2,00,000. ear- 2 - (ii) Article 4 denies the Company the right to explore in any part of Ajman territory except after written or- verbal permission. I saw Mr. Lermitte at Dubai yesterday, and he informs me that it is clearly understood between the Shaikh of Ajman and himself that this restriction applies only to the area known as Manama. In these circumstances the matter may be allowed to pass. ^ (iii) Article 8(a) seems to be particularly badly drafted, for as it stands it appears to lay down that even if a native of Ajman (or of the Company) injured an European British subject in Ajman the matter would be dealt with according to Shera Law. Although there is no Order in Council applying to Ajman, the Company has no right to make such an agreement with the Shaikh, which the latter might argue would bind us equally. Mr. Ler mitte however promises to make it clear by an exchange of letters with the Shaikh that this part of the Agreement relates only to offences by a native of Ajman against a native of Ajman.

Dear Starling, Would you please refer to the Political Resident’s ■%% ) letter of the 26th Januar}^, Ho.l25-S, copies of which were distributed with India Office letter^iTo.P. Z. 776/59 ? dated the 7th Pebruary, on the subject of the oil concession granted by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi to Petroleum C on c e s s i on s , L t d . 2. We share Powle’s and Weightman’s satisfaction that the Company have at last succeeded in extracting this concession from the Sheikh. We gather that Longrigg finds it difficult to explain why the Sheikh so suddenly changed his mind. Apparently it was not due (as surmised by Powle) to the letter given by Weightman to Longrigg (see India ft v--yp. i(n Office telegram of 1 the 3rd January, ho.19, enclosure to our letter P.Z.36/39 of the 5th January) reaffirming His Majesty’ Government’s refusal to let the Trucial Sheikhs negotiate with any oil Company other than Petroleum Concessions Limited since Longrigg tells us that in fact he kept the letter in reserve and did not find it necessary to produce it.3. With reference to paragraph 2 of Powle’s letter regarding the present intention of Petroleum Concessions Limited to leave Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain alone, we have spoken to Longrigg about this and find that he is confident, in view of the exiguous and (at least as far as cil goes) uninteresting territory controlled by these Sheikhs, that there would be no temptation to the Standard Oil Company to rush in and fill the vacuum. We think the matter might be left at that, at least until there is a definite sign of Standard Oil taking an interest in these two Sheikhdoms. 4. The points raised by the Political Resident on the Concession agreement and requiring consideration by us are as follows:- (i) The Petroleum Department should be consulted on the question whether we should insist on the inclusion in the agreement of a provision for payment in respect of natural gas. Prima facie the point does not seem of much importance, and the Sheikh has otherwise done well out of the agreement, but perhaps you would be good enough to advise. (ii) Modification of Article 8 (c) relating to the expulsion of employees from Abu Dhabi territory.s 3. ansier. (iii) Inclusion of an Article relating to trs v (|-j (iv) Inclusion of an Article relating to the opening of a hank. * (v) Inclusion of an article providing for an authoritative English text. 5. At the outset I should say that, in view of the great difficulty experienced by the Company in getting this concession, we feel that insistence on amendment of the Agreement would cause the Company very considerable embarrassment and difficulty and I gather that they themselves, naturally, but with good reason in this particular case, would greatly dislike having to go back to the Sheikh and re-open discussion with him. Consequently we have approached the above points with a feeling that they should if possible be met otherwise than I - | T -- I - .. j j u fltT i . u iijfnia- n i 1 by amendment of the agreement and that amendment should rmi fflfguivni ■ wn •wn be required only where it is absolutely essential. 6. With regard to point (ii), this is a matter m which the Admiralty and Petroleum Department are less concerned than the foreign Office. The nqte of 1936, referred to in Eowle’s comment, was brought to the notice /i 0 of /of the Foreign Office in Clausen’s letter to Brenan of the 18th September 1936, ho. P. Z. 6412/3 6, regarding the Bebai concession. I enclose the relevant extract for ready reference. Fowle 1 s objection to the concession is that it would confer on the Company judicial powers of deportation which should be reserved to the Political Agent, as in the Pebai concession (Article 10), notwithstanding that we have not yet obtained a fomal cession of jurisdiction from the Sheikh. Longrigg, I — gather, would argue that it is reasonable for the Company wno engage and import the personnel to exercise the right ■ o- «*** muon* ■&gt;. not only to dismiss but also to repatriate them. *— f Q Weightman, as you will see (paragraph 3 (b) of his letter of the 19th January) suggests that the point is perhaps of no great importance since if operations are begun by the Company on any considerable scale it will be necessary for us to arrange to exercise jurisdiction by Order-in- Council over British subjects and at any rate non-Moslem foreigners, and deportations would then be dealt with by the Political Agent. Although we do not know why Longrigg did not follow the wording of the Pebai concession or even that of the recent Kalba concession (Article/ j \ i m(Article 10) we agree with Weightman and suggest that it is not essential to press for am amendment of the Abu Dhabi concession in this respect. If it is thought desirable to meet Dowle’s point in some way, perhaps an article might be added to the Political Agreement on these lines - ,s In the event of the Company being required, under Article 8 (c) of their agreement with the Sheikh, to expel any of their employees from Abu Dhabi they will consult the Political Agent, Bahrein, before taking such action and will be guided by his advice as to the manner in which their obligations under the Article should oe fulfilled.' 7. As for point (iii), we suggest that the question of transfer is adequately covered by Article 2 o± tim Political Agreement, a draft of which is enclosed, ana that no amendment of the concession is required. 8. As regards the question of a oank (point (iv)) you may remember that Bowie, despite some doubt on the part of Weightman, recommended last year that we should forego, in the case of the remaining Trucial Sheikhs, the arrangement followed in the case of S]aar ^^ whi ch/71 ; W: ¥ I 6 . which, the Sheikh was required to undertake to obtain Eis Majesty’s Government’s approval before entering into negotiations for the opening of a bank (cf.para.7 of his fV letter C/427 of 6th July, enclosure to India Office letter W / 11 P.Z.4943/38 of the 15th July and para.2 (c) of his letter 1 , 628-S of 25th November, enclosure to India Office letter % P. Z. 8032/38 of the 9th December). It is true that in making this recommendation he assumed that the concession would, like earlier concessions, include an Article obliging the Sheikh to consult the Company in the matter of opening a bank. - r e are inclined to think tiia,t if no other amendment of the concession is considered essential we need not insist only on' the addition of a provision regarding a bank. It might, however, be of some advantage to include in the political agreement a provision to this effect - ’’The Company, whether they shall have been consulted by the Sheikh or not, wall not tender him any advice in the matter of the opening of a branch of a bank in Abu Dhabi without previous consultation with His Majesty’s Government”. We would also propose to ask the Political Resident, if he thought/ A l I m i73 - &lt; 5 &gt; thought it feasible, to endeavour, when conveying His ] i Majesty’s Government’s approval of the concession, to obtain from the Sheikh an undertaking similar to those t ——— given by Sharjah and Debai. ' L II) 9. Lastl^^, there is point (v) , the question of providing for an English text that should be authoritative. We do not know what are the difficulties apprehended by Eowle, and in any case the matter is primarily one for the Company. Longrigg feels satisfied that no difficulty should arise. He thinks it would be impossible to get &lt; the Sheikh to accept an English text as authoritative, nor, he says, would it be reasonable to insist on this, seeing that neither the Sheikh nor any of his advisers know English. As Weightman remarks there is no question of a possible conflict between texts in two languages. We think in the circumstances that Eowle’s suggestion need not be pursued. Yv r e propose, however, to obtain from the Company a. copy of the Arabic text for record and in order to check Longrigg’s translation. 10. Subject to your views, therefore, we would think it unnecessary to press for amendment of the ^ - - ~ i-r- concession and we would propose to negotiate, on behalf of/T3 8 . of His Majesty’s Government, an agreement with the Company in the terms of the enclosed draft, amended if thought desirable as suggested in paragraphs 6 and 8 above. Upon conclusion of the agreement we would propose to communicate His Majesty’s Government’s approval of the concession to the Sheikh and the Company. 11. I am writing similarly to Garrett and Eyres. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J. P. GIBSOKIk 6412/36. Extract from note dealing with Article 10 A rticle 10, pa ra.5. - Colonel Eowle notes as follows: 'While the Company have of course every right to dismiss any of their employees they cannot be given judicial powers of deportation, which is what the relevant sentence in this paragraph comes to * The Sheikh may request the local representative of the Company to send the person concerned - if a foreigner - out of the state oi Eebai’. These powers should be reserved as they are in Bahrein under the Order in Council to the Political Agent, Bahrein (he is the nearest political authority). In the relevant sentence the words ’Political Agent, Bahrein’ instead of ’local representative of the Company’ might oe substituted. This point, however, brings up the whole question of our legal powers on the Trucial Coast which are of course nil, since we have no Order in Council there. We may have to have an Order in Council for Pebai (as well as for the other States of the Trucial Coast where oil is found) as we have had to have one for Qatar, out I think the change in the wording of this article wnicn I suggest would be a useful step in getting the Sheikh to recognise one at least of the powers which we shall have to get oy Order in Council. I suppose, however, that from the legal point of view even though the Sheikh agrees no one can legally be deported until an Order in Council containing that proviso has actually been published. addition to the amendments suggested by Colonel Powle, it is agreed that the last sentence of the article should be omitt ed.V 7 -) T ii I - S A Ct H E E M E IT T dated the day of One thousand nine hundred and thirty is made E E T ¥ E E IT HIS MAJESTY’S GOVERTMEHT 111 THE U1TITED KINGDOM (hereinafter called {, nis Majesty’s Government”) of the one part and Petroleum Leo eioprent (Trucial Coast) Limited (hereinafter called ’’the Company” which expression shall where the context so admits be deemed to include its successors and/ or assignees and shall .also be deemed to include any subsidiary Company) of the other part.

Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No. 357-S dated the 17th April 1939 about the Kalba Concession money ? 2. There is nothing which can be really describable as a Kalba 'treasury”, and all State money goes into a box which is kept in Khalid*s personal care. I gather that Khalid takes this box around with him wherever he may go. 3. The Residency Agent however informs me that you spoke to him last time when you were on the Coast about the disposal of the Concession money, and he himself went to Khalid and asked him what he was doing about it. Khalid said that he quite re cognised that this money, or at any rate practically all of it, belonged to the State and to the minor Ruler, and he intended to use it solely for State purposes. As you will remember, at the time when Khalid was made Regent he signed an agreement, one article of which required him to keep an account of all the income and expenditure of Kalba State, and the Residency Agent is confident that this Concession money is going into that account. We can scarcely demand to see the account, but at any rate it is evident enough that Khalid has not spent any money on himself yet, i.e. there are no new fleets of motor cars or stories of jewels for women and so on, and Khalid still lives in a very simple manner. At the same time he is looking after the minor Shaikh very well indeed and spoke to me when I last met him of his desire to send him 'outside' for education when he is two or three years older. Meanwhile the boy is healthy and happy and has a local man as a sort of tutor. pourable Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.r 4.

This being so, and since Article 3 (c) states categorically that the Company shall exercise these powers if required to by the luler,and since His Majesty^ Oovernment by their approval of this concession confirm that the Company will exercise these illegal powers, I think it undesirable that the Article should stand in its present form. The Article in the Political Agreement suggested at the end of your paragraph 6 does not meet my objections, as this still leaves the Company with powers of expulsion# The corresponding part of Article 10 of the Dibai concession is not entirely satisfactory as even the Political Agent has in the absence of an Order in Council no legal powers of expulsion# At the same time he is an official of the British Government and so has an official status. jg»urtixer, the wording of the Dibai Agreement does not make it obligatory on the Political Agent to carry out the 5.

This is all to the good. 3 . On the points raised in paragraph 4 of your letter under reply, our observations are as follows*- r'' (i) The Agreement omits to provide for a royalty on natural gas* All w© can sajp is that the 3h^ikh forgoes a possible advantage - though# as a matter of fact, sales on natural gas on any scale have not so far taken place in the Persian Gulf oilfields* me agreement is for a long term, 75 years, and it would certainly seem, therefore, to have been in the 3hei*d^ s advantage to have provided for a natural gas royalty, tthe rate in Article 5(e) of the Debai Agreement was 2 annas per 1,000 cubic feet-. Possibly the point could be covered in an exchange of letters, but we should not object if yo u let siPi n £_^* (ii) We have no observations. (iii) we would have preferred the Agreement to have EsQl* » ‘fice, included a transfer clause on the lines of Clause 21 of/ Whitehall, s.w.i.or the Behai Agreement (see paragraph 4(e) of Fowls '3 letter P*2.776/39 of 26th January). But article 2 of the draft Political Agree ent certainly ;oes a long way to meeting the point, and v/e agree that it would he dangerous to re-open this question on the Concession Agreement at this stage. (iv) This is not really a point for the Petroleum Department, hut v/e agree with the line taken in paragraph 8 of your letter, and in particular with your proposed addition to the Political Agreement. (V* Vie have no observations. generally* we quite agree with the line taken in paragraph 5 of your letter that it is highly undesirable to risk re—opening difficult issues hy su gas ting modifications at this stage. the Political Agreement is in hand and we have no observations on the draft enclosed in your letter, except to note that the subsidiary company.

Article 8(c) of the concession reads *The ruler may (if the offender be a foreigner, apply to the company for expulsion of such employee from the territory and the Company shall be bound to expel him if the ruler so desires* 4 * Strictly speaking, ft the present time the ruler alone can expel anybody from the territory, including a foreigner, and this will be the strict legal position until, by agreement with the Sheikh, we obtain a grant of jurisdiction and take measures to exercise it by Order-in-Council* The clause, however, is interesting and rather useful as an implied admission on the part of the bfteikh that, even in existing circumstances, he should not exercise jurisdiction over foreigners* j &lt;e 2 In view of the difficulty of re-opening As regards the expulsion question, surest that it would be uhwise t o suggest any ^amendment to this provision in the exlsti_M state of affairs^ ' • Its/ • i'.Gibson, asqIts amendment can be considered if and when there is a grant ox 1 Jurisdiction and an Order-in-Council in respect oi this territory* and in that case the provision must be interpreted to mean that the company will a mly to the Political Agent for the expulsion of the foreigner in question. In the meantime, it would be usei u.i co come to some agreement with the company as to the manner, in which, in existing circumst an ces, the expulsion of foreigners is in fact to be achieved. In —— n | . |&gt; most cases, no doubt, if the company discharged the man and offered to repatriate him or send him somewhere else the man would probably go* if this does not work, the company must understand that they must apply to the Political A ent before any forcible measures are taken against him. We think the matter might be put to the company fairly fully on the above lines, but we would suggest that any understanding come to should remain outsit e the Political Agreement. 4. vie agree that a provision regarding advice about a bank, on the lines suggested in p^r^;raph 8 of your letter, may be included in the Political Agreement. 5. As regards the rest of the Agreement, we think that Article 6 does not seem quite correct as it stands. The reguMions which we should want the company to observe would be (a) (if and when an Order-3k}-Council has been made respecting this territory) any regulations which had been given the force of law in respect of foreigners under the Order-in-Council, and (b) (in existing circumstances} any regnl&amp;tions made by the Sheikh to which the Political Resident had signified his approval and perhaps also any instructions given by the Political Resident in the absence of, or in addition3. to, any regulations made t&gt;y th© dheiich. Therefore would it not iDe 'better to say: H any general regulations for civil aircraft made t&gt;y the Sheikh which have 'been approved by the Political Resident, and to any instructions or regulations issued by the Political Resident# 0 The altered wording of the first part of the phrase would cover the cases, I think, where the Shaikh’s regulations had, under an Order-in-Council, been made by him or by King r s Regulation as well as the case where in the absence of an Order the Political Resident had simply approved them# 6# Otherwise we concur in your proposal to . . cia B i,r - i i i T i r i rf iifi -H negotiate a Political Agreement with the Company in the terms of the draft enclosed in your letter, with the addition mentioned above# We also agree to the communication, upon conclusion of this agreement, of is Majesty* s Government 1 s approval of the concession to the Sheikh and the Company# I am sending copies of this letter to Jarrett and Starling# fours sincerely.

Moreover there is in this case the attendant risk that the question of jurisdiction might-be. come an open issue with the Sheikh, and this might well have unfortunate consequences if the Sheikh’s attitude is such that, as Fowle has recently stated, an attempt on our part to secure a formal cession of jurisdiction in Abu Dhabi would meet 'pss, Esq. , ign Off ice, S.W.l. withwith a refusal. r% v /e should be glad therefore to know whether you still advocate the course of action recommended in paragraph 3 of your letter 9 vstiich I understand to be in supersession of the addition to the Political Agreement suggested in paragraph 6 of Gibson ! s letter of the loth Aoril, * I am sendihg a copy of this letter for information to Starling and also to Jarrett (whose reply to Gibson’s letter of the 15th April is still awaited). i , - f (* bB v Air Mail.

CONRIDLIxITIAL. Dear Gibson, ^/ould you please refer to your letter No. P.Z.1608/39 of 15th April, about the Abu Dhabi Concession. We agree, since Petroleum Concessions Limited have now received a concession for Ajman, that there will be little harm in leaving Umm al Qaiwain alone for the present. Our remarks upon the points enumerated in paragraph 4 of your letter are as follows (i) ,/e do not wish to comment on the question of provision for a royalty on natural gas. (ii) We have no remarks on the proposals’ of the Foreign Office for dealing with the expulsion of aliens. (iv) We see no objection to the clause proposed in paragraph 8 of your letter to provide against the opening of a foreign bank. (v) We have no remarks on the proposal to be content with an English translation of the concession. 3. So far as concerns point (iii), we should , of course, have liked to see a transfer clause in the concession itself, on general grounds and more particularly as tho Political Agreement will not be backed, as in the case of earlier concessions, by an undertaking on the part of Sheikh. We note, howeyer, that the company are extremely reluctant to propose any substantial modification of the concession for fear of causing the Sheikh to change his mind. We observe, also, that this view is shared by the other ^bson, Lsq, P®IA OFFICE, S.W. 1.Departments concerned. In these circumstances and because no serious precedent seems likely to be created, we are prepared to agree to rest content with Clause 2 of the Political Agreement. 4. For similar reasons we are willing to drop the idea, which we had at one time, of proposing that provision should be made in the concession itself for pipe-line and refinery facilities, and for the safeguarding of sites required for defence purposes. 5. We have no comments on the draft Political # Agreement for Abu Dhabi. 6. The foregoing remarks hold goojd^also for the Kalba concession (Peel’s letter ?,Z.675/39 of the 19th April), in so far as they are applicable. There is presumably not the same risk of embarrassment in the event of an attempt to amend this concession, but in view of its relative unimportance, we do not demur to the omission of a transfer clause or of provision for ’’defence sites”. \7e have no remarks on the question of the proper disposal of payments made to the Company, nor on the draft Political Agreement enclosed with Peel’s letter .- O If fC, y ~' f i ’ 7.

The document specifically provides that a fresh agreement (which of course would require His Majesty’s Government’s approval) will he required for the grant of a mining concession. And as Petroleum Concessions Limited are by now well established on the Crucial Coast and fully acquainted with our requirements in the matter of procedure there seemed no need to reaffirm the conditions which* at a time when new ground was being hroken* were attached to the approval of the Has al Khaimah option in 1935 ( vide the enclosed extract copy of India Office letter to Mr. Skliros* No. P.Z.8856/35* dated the 12th December* 1935* copies of which were circulated at the time to the Departments concerned).

I am desired to say that in certain respects the agreement is considered to be open to criticism^ and it is possible that in other circumstances^ His Majesty's Government might have wished to require that it should be amended before receiving their approval^ particularly in view of the fact that in this case it is not proposed to make the Sheikh a party to the arrangements which His Majesty's Government propose to make with the Company.

The first relates to ^ * Article 8 ,c), which is open to objection in so far as it purports oO confer on the Company powers of compulsory d eportation over for eigne rs^ Possibly in the majority of cases chere would be no difficulty and the discharged man would be willing, at the Company's expense, to leave Abu Dhabi for his own country or some other destination. Until however such time as His Majesty's Govt, may formally aequir jurisdiction in Abu Dhabi and exercise it under an Order in Council, when they would automatically exercise powers of deportation over foreigners, it is considered that it will be necessary to require the Company to apply to the Political Agent before any measures are taken for the compulsory removal of their personnel from Abu Dhabi in. + '. . ■ y h c the circumstances contemplated in Article 8 (c)* It is proposed to invite the Company to agree to this stipulation by means of an exchange of letters.— 1 4. The second matter relates to the omission from the agreement of any provision for the payment of roya lty in respect of natural gas produced and sold* as for example was contained in Article '5 (e) of the Behai concession. The inclusion of such a provision is thought to he desirable in the Sheikh's interests. It could he effected hy means of an exchange of letters between your Company and the Sheikh and I am to enquire whether this could he arranged, 5.

(*** ^ i j^irrT •jt rffTtf-iinrr'i r ’T v the Company 1 s concession, hut until we have obtained cession of jurisdiction from the Ruler, there is no way in which the Concession Agreement can be amended so as to confer legal powers of expulsion on anybody except the Ruler. There is also the risk which you have pointed out, that any attempt to amend this article might make the question of jurisdiction an open issue. 3. In the circumstances, we still feel that it would be wiser to leave Article 8 (c) - with its implied admission on the part of the Sheikh that foreigners are outside his jurisdiction - as it stands, and. we would suggest that some understanding should be reached with the Company as to the measure in which foreigners can in fact be expelled. 4. We also feel that this understanding would best be recorded outside the Political Agreement, because whether or not the company consult the Political Agent before they take any action of the kind under discussion on the Abu Dhabi territory, they will strictly speaking have no legal ground for taking tnat action. 2 .

City-Gate House, FinsLury Sguare, With reference to your letter PZ.3225/39 dated August 1st regarding the Political Agreement arising ' out of our Kalhah Concession, there are three points in the draft to which I should like to refer. The first occurs in the sixth line of Article 4°. would you agree to the addition of the words u or at some point on the Trucial Coast ,! to the exisiting words ,f in Kalhah or Bahrain*', since our representative may he for long periods resident at Sharjah or Dubai? Secondly, is there any significance in the omission of the phrase 'the Shaikh shall not unreasonably withhold such permission' (a phrase which occurs in Article 10 of the Dubai and of the Sharjah Political Agreements) from Article 10 of the proposed .Agreement? The Article, found as Article 11 in the Dubai and the Sharjah Agreements, regarding arbitration i’ n case of attempted termination by the Shaikh, is omitted from your now proposed draft. It seems that the situation visualised in these Agreements might equally well occur in our relations with the Regent of Kalbah? PC.24/62. London 8th August, 1939. Dear Mr. Peel Yours sincerely?

London, S.C.2. 8th August, 1939. Dear Mr. Peel, I write in reply to your letter P.Z.4216/39 dated August 2nd. The reference in Article 8(c) was intended to he to foreign personnel specifically imported into Abu Dhabi territory by the Company for work there. Such importation would have been on the definite understanding (with the employee) that in case of failing to give the Company satisfaction he would be liable to repatriation. It is not felt that, in practice, repatriation-would present any difficulties, and it is hard to imagine it being questioned by the employee concerned; if, however, you feel that an exchange of letters, such as that to which you refer at the end of paragraph 3 of your letter, is desirable, the Company would feel no objection - on the assumption that the Company’s reference in the matter to the Political Agent would be confidential and v/ithout the cognisance of the Shaikh. Royalty on natural gas produced and sold was deliberate, and formed part of a process of simplification of the Concession document, which appeared necessary in order to make it as little alarming as possible to the Shaikh. The omission was the easier because the livelihood of The omission of any reference to the payment of exploiting/exploiting natural gas in this remote territory appears so small that it may, for practical purposes, he ignored* The Company is prepared, if you so desire, to give to His Majesty*s Government an assurance that it will not produce or sell natural gas otherwise than upon payment of Royalty to the Shaikhs hut there does seem to he considerable ohjection to an exchange of letters with the Shaikh himself in a sense which may make him feel (although quite incorrectly) either that the Company treated him ungenerously in the Concession, and are willing now to put forward new clauses in his favour, or that His Majesty’s Government are now overhauling the Concession terms with a view to safe-guarding the Shaikh*s interest, while at the time of the main negotiations they were willing to let agreement he reached directly between the Shaikh and the Company upon matters much more important than the Royalty on natural gas. There are three other points in the draft Agreement which accompanied your letter under reply, upon which I would venture to comment? They are identical 11| I to those to v/hich attention is drawn in my letter No.pC./24/62 of today’s date regarding the draft Kalbah Political Agreement, and I shall he grateful for your comment upon these in due course.

Will you please refer to paragraph 2 of your derai- official letter No. 469-S dated the 10th May 1939 to the India Office in regard to the utilisation of the Kalba concession money ? 2. I wrote to Shaikh Khalid as instructed, but^his reply, while assuring me that f, the revenue of Kalba is kept in the State Treasury and spent on matters concerning Kalba State”, did not refer specifically to the oil concession money. I therefore made a further enquiry from him and have now had a reply dated the 23rd July 1939. of which I enclose a copy. 3. This reply is, I think, entirely satisfactory, and in view of the fact that the Company* s object in concluding the Kalba Concession was partly to provide for an approach to the hinterland tribes through Shaikh Khalid no objection need, I suggest, be taken to Shaikh Khalid* s statement that some of the money is used to ”ensure facilities for the future and to obtain the necessary security for the geologists and all other work”.

I was much pleased by ^ n&amp; r ruteS. the receipt of your kind letter Mo. 393 of 12th Jamad al Awwal 1358 (30-6-39). With reference to your remark that my last rurf'' rtSLCJb - letter of 8th Rabi-ul-Thani 1358 (28-5-39) in reply to your first letter was not clear about the matter which you have mentioned, and that the Honourable the Political Resident has asked you for a confirmation whether the revenue derived from the oil concession is included in the State 1 s income. There is no doubt that it is included in the income of the State and the amounts spent for establishing order and tran quility among the tribes is paid out of the same. No doubt you understand that matters have changed and are different from what they were some years a go. formerly it was not necessary for the Kalba Government to endeavour to please the tribes, but now, in order to safeguard the interests of the State, preserve its prestige and ensure facilities for the future, and to obtain the necessary security for the geologists and all other work, it is necessary to do so. I am well prepared to discharge the duties which I have undertaken and pray the Almighty to help me. Usual Ending.$£* By Aw* Mail - p.Z. 19 i 1 P ,o INDIA OFFICE.

P.Z.4842/39 and P.Z. 4843/39 9 dated the 12th August 9 on the subject of the concessions granted to the Company by the Sheikhs of Kalba and Abu Dhabi. With regard to the three roints raised by Longrigg in his first letter ? P.C. 24/62 as to the Political Agreements, there seems to be no objection to the first. As to the second, the omission of the phrase n the Sheikh shall not unreasonably withhold such permission' had no special significance, but v/e felt that it was liable to raise awkward questions as to what was or was not unreasonable behaviour and that as it was not strictly necessary it was better to leave it out. We would propose to adhere to the omission of these words. In/In raising tne third point the Company seems to have overlooked the fact that the Sheikhs in this case are not to he cognisant of the Political Agreements and therefore this particular Article is not applicable. As regards the two matters relating to the Abu Dhabi Concession dealt with in Longrigg { s letter PC.33/63, the fact that the Company intend to make it a definite understanding that foreign personnel &gt;u _ imported into Abu Dhabi will be liable to repatriation, if found unsatisfactory, should no doubt help to ensure that no difficulties should arise in practice, but it would seem preferable to adhere to our proposal, to which the Company is prepared to agree, for an exchange of letters with the Company requiring a reference to the Political Agent in cases of repatriation. The Company can be informed that there will be no need to bring the Sheikh into the matter. As regards the other point as to the production o-rd sale of natural gas, we would suggest that the/:$*■ 3. the matter v/ill 'be adeouately covered 'by the Company’s offer to give an assurance that they will not produce or sell natural gas otherwise than upon payment of royalty to the Sheikh and that we need not press our original proposal for an exchange of letters between the Company and the Sheikh. Both these points might 'be dealt with in the letter which we propose to exchange with the Company. If you agree with our views on these points it is proposed now to convey to the Company the approval of His Majesty’s Government to the oil concession granted 'by the Sheikh of Atm Dhabi as soon as the Political Agreement has been executed. As regards the Kalba Concession^ we are still waiting to hear from Fowle that the exchange of letters between Sheikh Khalid and the Political Agent has taken of Fowle’s demi-official lettelTo place b&gt; si f 10 th 9 see May, paragraph 469 S. 2 Yours sincerely 9 (Sgd-) R.

We agree with your views on the various points raised by Longrigg* and we concur in the proposal to convey to the Company the approval of His Majesty’s Government to the oil concession granted by the oheikh of Abu Dhabi as soon as the Political Agreement has been executed. 3. Some of Longrigg’s remarks about the “’natural gas” question raise rather an interesting point. I suppose that His Majesty’s G-overnment do in fact regard themselves as responsible for seeing that rulers under their/ P* Gib s on ^ sq_a2 . their protection like the Trucial Sheikhs are faily treated hy concession hunters, whether foreign or British; and that they do not renounce this responsibility, or the right to make subsequent criticisms, merely because they tell the company desiring a particular concession that they are free to go ahead and negotiate with a particular ruler. Longrigg 1 s remarks imply the opposite. Yours sincerely, (S gd.) H.M.Byres.21321/P-248 6,000 (2 sorts) 7/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

We have instructed our Bahrain Office to infom the Shaikli that, under present conditions it is not possible to complete exploration this year and to exercise our right to the year J s extension permissible under the Permit on an increased annual rental of Rs .45,000. As it is unlikely that any further exploration xrork on the Trucial Coast can be undertalxen during the xrar, we have also suggested to our Manager at Balirain that he should endeavour to obtain the Shaikh agreement to any further extensions which may be necessary to cover the period up to tv/olve months after the end of the war, as the Permit does not include any provision under which we can claim extensions on grounds of force majeure, which undoubtedly exists today by reason of our inability to obtain the equipment and staff necessitating the use of dollar exchange.

Also discussed are the political agreements between the company and His Majesty’s Government for each concession which would no longer require approval by the ruler of the state and discussing amended clauses to incorporate this decision.In relation to the Kalba concession matters discussed included ensuring sufficient safeguards and guarantees were in place to protect Shaikh Hamad bin Sa’id [Ḥamad bin Sa‘īd Āl Qasimī], who was a minor, and his state whilst it was under the rulership of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad bin Sultan [Khalid bin Aḥmad bin Sulṭān Āl Qasimī] as Regent. A copy of the Abu Dhabi Concession agreement can be found at folios 134-140 and Political agreement at folios 160-16; copies of the Kalba political agreement can be found at folios 64-69 and 164-165.Other matters discussed in the volume include:a five year exploration permit granted by the Shaikh of Ajman (Shaikh Rāshid Bin Ḥumaid Al-Nu`aimī) to Petroleum Concessions Limited, a copy of which can be found at folios 51-52;copies of lettersin Arabic and English from Ernest Vincent Packer, PCL to the Political Agent at Bahrain, the Sultan of Muscat, the Shaikh of Sharjah, the Shaikh of Dubai and the Regent at Kalba regarding the lack of an annual report for 1940 as owing to war conditions no work had been undertaken;the appointment of F A Ball as Chief Local Representative for Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited and the decision to retain Ernest Vincent Packer as General Manager at Bahrain and appoint Basil Henry Lermitte as Chief Local Representative for Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited;a report by the Master of the Steamship
