His costume is the same as that worn by the royal scribe Nahu, also shown here. The three stylized flesh folds on the official's upper abdomen were a conventionalized method of showing relatively advanced age and prosperity. The remaining hieroglyphic text (on the back) mentions Ptah and Sokar, gods associated with ancient Memphis, suggesting that this sculpture came from the official's tomb at Saqqara, which was the primary necropolis, or cemetery, of Memphis.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1929", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/39167", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris, [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1929, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "late 18th-19th Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.017", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.111_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.111_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.111_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.111_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL1_22.111_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543599", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL1_22.111_3QtrVw_TR_T02.jpg, PL1_22.111_Fnt_TR_T02.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
