Shaikh Da’il bin Hamad, Shaikh All bin Ahmad, Shaikh Rashid bin Mohamnod, Shaikh Ahmad bln Hamad, Shaikii All bin hhalifah bin bu’lj, Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah bin Ibrahim. You will note that there are In fact nine judfas working under the Bahrain Government and of these nine judges there is not one who has received any legal training whatsoever* It is also interesting to note that with only one exception all the juices belong' to the Haling Family and I regret to say that at least two-thirds of then have been appointed not for their learning or upright character but in ord^r to increase their prestige and emoluments at one ana the same time. 2* It has come to my knowledge that the comoosition of and the lack of ability of the Bahrain Government judicial benches in causing unfavourable comment in the town. I see no objection to numbers of the Ruling Family being dispensers of justice provided they aru persons of reasonable intelligence and good character, Jn fact it is better that the judges be drawn from i the ranks of the ancient aristocracy, but It is in my opinion preferable that,be thoy from the aristocracy SHSa^gg£5^gfc£gK55g T or the proletariat,they acquire some knowleare of the Law. B. ohalkh Salman bin iiohanmed is the fifth son of His Highness senior uncle. lie is twenty four years of age and was educated cn’ble v&gt;ir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.n., /at Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. iShaikh Salmar-. Is of pleasant appearance, speaks Uv lish M l, and .as far a* I can ascertain, of &gt;;ooa character. He left the Ameri can College In 1'340 and has been itde In Bahrain father. He is interested In Law and woulo'tifce to have some alia in lire. I have talked the question over with Belrrave and he is In accord with ray view that Shaikh ^alrrson would repay efforts raaie to further his interest in local natters and nig! t prove a responsible and ablt* administrator of justice. 4. I have considered the advantages and disadvantages of India, Iraq, ‘mJ, stalestine&lt; as suitable treinitl rounds and I h*»ve cone to the conclusion that the last nased is tlio most suitable co^ontry for a young Arab to be Instructed in the administration of justice. I am, unfortunately, ignorant of the judicial system of Palestine and whether or no there are any legal courses which shaikh oalman could attend. ..Ithoug the theory of Law is important it is in ray opinion not nearly so important as practical experience in the trial of causes und the assessing of the value of evidence. I therefore suggest that enquiries be made from the High Commissioner in Palestine with a view to ascertaining if it woulu be possible for Shaikh Salman to attend a Law course In Palestine and whothe tho Palestine Government would be prepared to arran e for him to receive practical instruction and if possible experience In the trial of both criminal and civil cases. for the much to -m qrust and that of his Tours sincerely,G.T.O. / Telegram ^rorr] Political i-ie^ident, Bush ire.

Dalrymple Delgrave, Esq., Adviser to the Bahrain Go\ r ermnent, Bahrain. Ms. /(» v 6th November, 1944• ' iK^e.. I received your telegram about Sheikh Salman’s judicial training in Jerusalem and replied yesterday after I had had a second session with the Attorney General here about it. The reason I have not been able to do this earlier is that the A.G. has been away in Syria and has only just got back, and I have had also to see the Chief Justice, Sir William Fitzgerald. ~ I will take your points seriatim. POINT 1. YOUR SUGGESTION OP ONE YEAR’S COURSE OP LAW LECTURES FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST SIX MONTHS PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. and POINT 2. CAN PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT MAXE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR LAW LECTURES? ANSWER: Palestinian Law is a fairly complicated one^including both the old Ottoman Statutes and English Common Law, so that the course which the Government lays down for Palestinian aspirants is a 5-year*s course and covers every conceivable aspect Major T. Hickinbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, BAHREIN. /of law -of law - Contract Law, fort. Theory of UiVidence, etc., etc. The course of lectures now in process comes to an end in about a year’s time, so students are well through it. Clearly, you will want something far simpler and more practical. There is no machinery in the Palestine Government for such a case as Sheikh Salman’s, so he would have to make use of what there is. Don't you think the indigeous practices of the Courts in Iraq to be more up the Bahrein Alley? This does not mean that Palestine does not ,want to help. The suggestions for Salman are:- The A.G. will be prepared to put Salman on to suitable books and get hold of typescripts of some of the appropriate lectures that have been given over the past law course. He will arrange for him to attend selected lectures in the ensuing year, though this is bound to present difficulties to Salman • • as he wont have had the background lectures. The Chief Justice agrees that Salman would be allowed to sit with the Magistrates in some of the county courts, e.g. Ramallah, Beersheba, etc., and that in Jerusalem he will be able to sit in the Grand Council’s Office and Registry of the Chief Justice’s Office to see how cases are prepared, though, of course, there would be no official able to afford the time to devote to Salman and his progress would depend on his own keenness and initiative. Both tl^e Chief Justice and the Attorney General think that Salman would learn all that he is likely to need for Bahrein purposes (the 5-year’s course of complex law procedure, etc., is suited to Palestine rather than to Bahrein) in much less time than you have envisaged. / 3 .Centre of Arab Studies in the Middle East, Austrian Hospice, Jerusalem. -3- They think that 9 months should be sufficient. You will be aware, of course, 'Chat there exists considerable political tension in this country which is not likely to grow less in the immediate future and I presume that you and the Bahrein Government would wish to warn Salman so that he would avoid getting involved. POINT 3. WHAT WOULD BL THE APPROXIMATE GOST? AI\SWBR: There would, of course, be no charge for any government advice or services in connection with his sitting in courts and government law offices. Taxi transport to county courts would probably cost a couple of pounds a day on the days he attended them. The law lectures, it is thought, cost about .£15 or £20 a year. POINT 4- WOULD THE A.G. BE PREPARED TO HAVE SHEIKH SALMAN TESTED OCCASIONALLY TO ENSURE THAT HE IS JUSTIFYING THE EXPENSE OF HIS. TRAINING? APSWKR: ^ The A.G. would be very glad to make enquiries trom time to time and test him conversation ally for your information. POINT 5. HOW SOON CAN HE START? AI\b&lt;»ER : Subject to your acceptance of any financial responsibilities for Salman and also to the answer to Point 6, which follows. Sheikh Salman could come as soon as he pleases.-4- POIM 1 6. YOUR POINT - Hj£ WILL PROBABLY TAKE LODGINGS IN THE TOWN AND BRING HIS WIPE• ANSVi/ER: This is more easily said than done. The housing problem here is extremely acute; in fact, it is almost impossible. I had the greatest difficulty in getting a house for one of my own instructors, and rents are frightfully high as is also the cost of living. The English hotels in the same way are booked up weeks ahead, and in any case I take it if he wants to have his wife, there would not be the necessary privacy in a hotel. Did Sheikh Salman, I wonder,, contact anyone here and find for himself and his wife, accommodation, because otherwise it is going to be a problem. A Both the Chief Justice and the Attorney General consider that Salman should not bring his wife in the first instance, but come along and have a look round. Bona fide Government Officials here cannot get accommodation even with Government requisitions. Has Sheikh Salman received an offer from some Arab householder friend of his here to share a house with him - I wonder? I hope all this does not sound discouraging, and it w'ould have been more satisfactory perhaps if you would have spared enough time when you were here to have met the Judicial Authorities^ and decided with them what is really required in Salman’s case. As I say, I have seen Sir William Pitzgerald today and have had tvyo interviews with Lr. Gibson, the Attorney General, and subject to the above, they are both very willing to do all they can to help.— Centre of Arab Studies in the Middle East, Jerusalem Austrian Hospice, 5 Excuse a dictated letter, and thanic you for yours of October 21st which I must reply to as soon as I have got a moment; it was very nice to see you here the other day. iiinclosed is a telegram which arrived for you the day after you left.

I told His Highness that I considered that Shaikh Salman should be given the opportunit be ' of going zo Palestine but that he should not^permitted to v take his family with him.

I told them that I would write to the Palestinian Government and ask them to inform me by telegram if at any time the internal position should deteriorate to such ah extent that it was in their opinion desirable for Shaikh Salman zo return to Bahrain. I also said that should the Attorney General report that Shaikh Salman was not paying due regard to his work it woul r - be advisable for him to be recalled at once. His Highness agreed to my suggestions and as a result I yesterday telegraphed stating that Shaikh Salman was ready to pro ceed to Palestine immediately and asking the Chief Secretary to whom he should report on arrival at Jerusalem.

Memorandum His Highness Shaikh Sulman has given permission to his cousin Shaikh Hamad bin Mohamed bin Isa, who has been for the last six years at Beirut.University, to go to the United States in order to enter Stanford University in California where is is hoped that he will obtain a degree in two years. His Highness proposes to allow Shaikh Hamad the sum of Rs.6,000/- per annum to cover fees, wauft and necessary expenses. ^ I am writing to enquire whether it will be possible for the Bahrain Government to obtain the equivalent of Ks.6,000/- in dollars in the U.S.A. in order that when arrangements are made for Shaikh Hamad entering Stanford University he may be able to draw from a bank the sum which is being allowed to him. The authorities of Stanford University have informed Shaikh Hamad that he will be accepted there. Adviser to the Government S.Z in receipt. Date .. t € . ?C . ^ '2/— as follows:- Bahrain Government primary School about four years. Beirut Slementary School, High (Secondary) two years. Beirut School, three years. Obtained High School Certificate. Beirut University, Freshman (Arts) one year. Sophomore (Arts) one year. Obtained Intermediate Section Certificate, this entitles the holder to enter the Junior Class of the University course in Economics, Political Science or other subjects classified under Arts. According to the practice of American Universities a degree is normally obtained after studying for one year in the Junior Class and a further year in the Senior Class. This means that Shaikh Hamad, if admitted to an American University should obtaimJa degree in two years time from now.£ ^ - 2 - He completed five courses during the last University year, 1946-47, consisting of:- 1. Economics. 2. Political Science. 3. Modern History (European) 4. Philosophy. 5. English Literature. He is in possession of his Elementary, High School and Intermediate Section Certificates copies of which he has sent to Utah State College (Lozan) and Stanford, California. I believe the last of these certificates is equivalent to or better than a 'Higher School' Certificate which is needed in the case of entrants to Bristol University about which I have,been making enquiries. The Bristol University informed me that provided Shaikh Hamad’s qualifications were acceptable they were prepared to accept him in October 1948. The American Universities on the other hand will take him this next December. Adviser to the Government. S.ZJ D.O. No. C/1039 POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 21st of October, 1947 Dear 3ir Rupert, please refer to the enclosed copies of memoranda I have received from the Adviser. 2. I have discussed this with Belgrave and, unofficially, with the boy's brother, Shaikh Khalifah. I gather that the Ruler, Belgrave, and the boy's father and brothers are all anxious for him to go to a university in the united Kingdom. Belgrave examined the possibility of getting a vacancy for him in England this summer, but the only university that would offer him a place was Bristol - in October, 1948 -, subject to his being up to their entrance standard. Shaikh Hamad bin Mohamed naturally does not want to wait a year before going up; and he has persuaded his family to let him go to Stanford instead. 3. in the present dollar crisis, I can think of no justi fication for spending $3700/- to educate the boy in America when the political connections of the A1 Khalifah are exclusively with His Majesty's Government.- especially as the boy wishes to study political science. There are no dollars left for allotment by me, and I cannot recommend the grant of a special allotment. 4. I do feel, however, that we should do all we can to get him a vacancy in the United Kingdom earlier than next October, if at all possible; and I would suggest that the position be explained to the Commonwealth Relations Office and that they may be asked to use their influence to secure a place for him, either at Bristol or another university, as soon as possible. 5. Meanwhile, there is nothing - except his own dis inclination - to stop him going back to Beirut for another year. That would be better for him than hanging about in Bahrain with nothing to do.

I enclose copies of demi-official letter No. 103-2E, dated the 26th November, 1947, from Belgrave, and its enclosures which please also see. There can, of course, be no two opinions that, from our point of view, it is desirable that Shaikh Hamad should go to a British University. I find it difficult, however, to make any recommendation on the enclosures as I do not think we can very well refuse a mere £3,700/- and urge this as a reason for preventing the young man from going to America. I should be grateful to know how I should reply to Belgrave’s letter. Yours sincerely NS.ukgi:n r. POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 4th December, 1947 D.O. No. C/1161 Dear Sir Rupert, I have had Shaikh Hamad bin Mohammed in about his dollars for his proposed journey to America to join Stanford University, and T told him not to go to you as I assumed you would be rather rushed before going on tour. He says that if he does not get the dollars within the next week or so, he will : be unable to travel by a ship leaving from here for the States which will get him there in time to join the University for the beginning of a term In January. He also says that the Oil Company would help out with a loan of the dollars if we could not get them for him in time. Russell Brown and Hanna seem willing to do this provided that we have no objection. And if you have none, I will tell Shaikh Hamad and Russell Brown that he can be given the loan. There seems to be no other way of enabling him to catch his ship in time. Yours sincerely 1'he Hon’ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.3.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bahrain.

' The request was made to me on the ground, which I have no reason to doubt, that the original #200/- per month is only enough for the schooling and boarding of Shaikh Hamad while the #200 now ap plied for is required to pay for his transport to and from the University, his clothes, and his pocket money. It is not really, however, on this ground that I would ask you to refer the case to Colonel Galloway and would urge that the extra allotment asked for be granted without further ado. 3. The Shaikh's view of the dollar question is that 'his* oil company has hundreds of thousands of dollars and that he has a claim to as much of this currency as he wants within reason. As far as I knew this is unanswerable and if it is accepted, it is im politic and unfair that fuss be made on these requests for small amounts. If, in this case, the request is turned down, the Shaikh will of course hear of it and probably have to buy the dollars himself in the uncon trolled market.

(&gt; ^— : S.O.No.C/S-54 Dear Stobart, POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, The 17th May, 1949. id *1 X 'i £ ■/jb ) Thank you for your demi-official letter No.483, dated the 11th May 1949. It seems to me that the case for educating the young sons of the Shaikhs is strongest in Dubai and Abu Dhabi and I should be grateful if you would sound the Rulers as to the possibility of sending Maktum bin Rashid and Sultan bin Shakhbut to Bahrain for education in the first place. I should say that I myself seem to have mis understood Mr.Burrows (who took the matter up with me in London in the first place) and to have thought that he had Western Education only in mind. I have since discussed it with him and he agreed to my proceeding on the lines of trying to get some of these youths educated up to the Bahrain standard in the first place, at any rate.

We would accordingly ask for dollar exchange for Shaikh Hamad in 1949 to the value of £.900 in all.

Dated 26th June, 1949 Copy to the Eastern Bank Limited, Bahrain.Confidential. No.C/R-406. Political Agency, Bahrain, 1st August, I960, Dear Pelly, You may be interested to learn that Belgrave informed me thet during a recent discussion with the Shaikh on education, the latter announced his intention of sending his son Muhammad to school in Fngland next year. 2. I am not certain what Muhammad’s reaction to a English school would be (violent I expect), but Belgrave told me that the Shaikh seemed very decided; and I cer tainly think that it should be encouraged. As far as I know, Muhammad talks no English, which would be a dis advantage; but I suppose it is possible that the school in Somerset, to which so many Bahrainis go, would be able to deal with a situation like this. I think it might be worth looking into. /'] Yours sincerely, His Excellency Mr. C.J. Pelly, O.B.E., Ag. Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.it would be necessary for Shaikh Salman to explain what has happened to the previous one, for how long it is proposed to continue the allotment of 200 dollars ^ per month, and v/hether this will be the full limit required. At the moment, the Eastern Bank is still dealing *1 &amp; . with the Reserve Bank of India and could f under their instructions^sell dollars to Shaikh Salman on production by him of a letter of recommendation (if made) signed by me. In view, however, of the strict stand taken by the Treasury and the Political Resident, the case will have to be referred to him if we decide to support it. Shaikh Salman may be informed of the position. ^ ltd. C.J.P. 8-4-48.
