I understand that his authority extends also to Polish all airs in India and East Africa. 2. I said that I would let you know that he was coming and ask the British authorities in the Middle East to extend to him all the usual courtesies and facilities. 5. Strassburger is an intelligent and reasonable man having experience of business life as well as of politics and diplomacy; he is sincerely inclined to moderation in his views but cannot be trusted always to maintain them at the risk of losing his position. His English is passable.
