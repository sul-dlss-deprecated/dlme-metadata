I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a letter which I have received from the Cornmander-in- Chief, East Indies Station vtfiich has been addressed to various authorities on the East Indies Station.. 2. I have been asked to review the situation in the Persian Gulf. Although the Commander—in«-Chief refers to British port3 f in such matters he wishes me to consider the interests of countries allied to or in Treaty agreement with the British Empire. 5. In so far as Bahrain is concerned I propose to reply that I consider the supervision of landing of cargo and persons is such that there is no possibility of unauthorised persons or material being landed. 4. I should be grateful if you would inform me if you concur in this view and I presume you will inform, the Political Resident of this matter in due course.

Si r, I have the honour to inibrm Your Excellency that the possibility exists of the enemy landing men or war materials in British ports from disguised merchant ships with the object of causing damage or a diversion. This danger is not considered imminent on the East Indies Station but measures are being planned to prevent such landings should the need arise. 2. These measures would entail thoroughly searching .'.11 ships before they enter British ports. To do this, the present examination service staffs are inadequate and would have to be assisted from other local resources such ae Customs or Police. if Your Excellency agrees in principle with the scheme, would you be good enough to inform me to what extent additional searching staffs could oe provided at ports under your Government? The actual search would be the responsibility of the Naval Authorities. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your Excellency f s obedient Servant, VICE-ADMIRAL. COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
