Foreign Representatives. Monsieur Vadala was Vice-Consul for Prance throughout the year. Dr. Listemann was German Consul up to the 9th March, when it became necessary to arrest and deport him to India, as it was found that he was carry ing on dangerous intrigues with disaffected Chiefs m the hinterland and incitin 0 them to attack the British Colony in Bushire. Mullah Husain, Dragoman, remained in charge of the Turkish Consulate until the 8th August when Bushire was occupied by British troops : the iurkign flag was then removed and the Consulate has since remained m abeyance. The local Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Mr. W. P. Manson, held charge of the Norwegian Vice-Consulate throughout the year. Charge of the Dutch and Italian Consulates was held by the British Consulate-General throughout the year. Mirza Ali Muhammad Khan, Muwaqqar -ud-Dowleh, remained Governor local GoTernment and Persian Official.. Govet- from the beginning of the year to the 8th nor of Bushire. August when the British occupation ot Bushire took place and he had to be relieved of his office. ^ He was despatched to Bombay a week later, and he has since remained there in retirement. On the restoration of Bushire to the Persian Government, His Excellency the Darya Begi was nominated Governor and arrived and took charge from the British Military Governor on the 16th October. Mirza Ahmad Khan, Masud -es-Sultaneli, was Karguzar or Persian Poreign Office Agent up to the British occupation, KarSQZa^ • when he was relieved of his appointment, and allowed to proceed to Mohammerah. On the restoration of Bushire to the Persian Government he was apparently re-appointed _ Karguzar, but was afraid to return to Bushire as his old enemy the Darya Begi had become Governor. Abdur Eeza remained Kalantar until the British occupation when he was ^ removed and Haji Yuauf appointed in his a an ' ar ' place ; the latter continued in office until the end of the year. Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh was Govern or-General of Pars up to 14th September., , He was most actively pro-German and Governor-Geneia, o ars. anti-British, and by far the most dangerous enemy we had in Southern Persia. His removal was made one of the conditions for our evacuation of Bushire after occupation, and he was recalled and left Shiraz on the 23rd September and, after hanging about the vicinity for about a week, finally left the vicinity on the 30th September. Qawam-ul-Mulk, a local magnate friendly to Great Britain, was appointed Acting Governor-General in his stead, but was not able to withstand the intrigues and finally the attacks of the Germans, ' Democrats ' and rebellious Gendarmarie, and was driven out of Shiraz towards the end of December. After his disappearance the rebels appointed Nasir-ul-Mulk as Acting Governor. Soon after the removal of the Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, the Persian Government nominated His Koyal Highness Nasrat-es-Sultan, the youngest son of His late Majesty Muzaffar-ud-Din, Shah, but His Royal Highness never got beyond Ispahan and is unlikely to take up his appointment until Qawam-ul-Mulk has been able to regain possession of Shiraz. Monsieur Bourgeois held charge of the office of Provincial Director of ^ ^ Customs during the voar. Durinsr the Customs and ihnance, • -i p t&gt; -j • i j - * • oxi period or British occupation, August 8th to October 16th, Monsieur Bourgeois carried on the Customs Department under the British Administration. During the first three-fourths of the year very large imports of tea and other goods took place and the Customs receipts in Bushire were very high. The increased imports were due to the cessation of imports into Persia through Baghdad via the Dardanelles and Trebizond and through. Bussia. In the first quarter an additional reason was supplied by theFOR THE YEAR 1915. 3 disturbed condition of Arabistan, owing to which imports through Moham- merah and Arabistan were suspended. On 5th May, the Finance Department was separated from the Customs Department, and Sulaiman Mirza was put in charge of the Bushire Finance Department Agency. '* Moses Khan ' (Mr. Katchaturian, an Armenian, em ployed for many years as Personal Assistant to the Director of Customs at Bushire) succeeded M. Stas as Agent of the Finance Department at Shiraz. As mentioned in last year's report (page 9) the Bushire hinterland was Condition of Bushire and neighbouring dis- remarkably cjuiet when the year openeJL tricts. Very early in the year this began to change. The German Consulate had begun to intrigue with Eais Ali of Tangistan and other Chiefs as far back as September 1914, and soon after the beginning of the year these intrigues began to bear fruit. In January, Herr Wassmuss, who had been Acting Consul at Bushire till the beginning of July 1914 and who had then gone on leave to Europe, appeared in Shushter as the head of a Mission to raise Persia and Afghanistan and, if possible, the Indian Frontier against Great Britain, Herr Wassmuss was accompanied by Dr. Linders and Mr. Bohnstorff and some Persians and 3 or 4 seditious Indians. He at once began to incite the people to jehad and distribute large sums to influential men and Mullahs with a view to raising them against the British. In February, it was ascertained that he was going to march through Ram Hormuz to Borasiun. As he was openly inciting the people to break the neutrality of Persia and his jehad propaganda, etc., was dangerous, it was decided to try and induce the friendly Khan of Haiyat Daud, through whose territory he would be passing, to bring him down to the coast where he could be arrested. Captain Noel went to Bandar Big, on 3rd March, and Mr. Chick went a short time later to arrange the matter with Haidar Khan of Haiyat Daud. The Khan readily agreed to interc€)pt Wassmuss and bring him to the coast, and Wassmuss and his party were intercepted by the Khan's brother. Unfortunately Wassmuss himself gave the Khan's men the slip during the night, but Dr. Linders and the caravan were brought to Bandar Big and much valuable information obtained. Large quantities of inflammatory pamphlets and leaflets in Arabic, Persian, Hindustani, and various Indian languages were found in the kit; some of them were incitements io jehad and some suggestions to Indians to rise against the British. Dr. Linders was brought to Bushire in R. I. M. S. 'Nearchus,' on 8th March. Meanwhile, as it was certain that Dr. Listemann, the German Consul at Bushire, was intriguing with the Tangistanis, it had been decided to arrest and deport him together with the local agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus who was aiding him. The Consul and Herr Eisenhutt were accordingly arrested without creating trouble in the early hours of the 9th March and removed to B. I. M. S. &lt;e Nearchus' wdiich had arrived off Bushire. The arrangements for the arrest were made by Captain Neale. First Assistant, who was in charge of the Besidency at the moment and Captain Oakes, Commanding the detachment of the 102nd Grenadiers, Indian Army, stationed at Bushire. The papers found at the German Consulate conclusively proved that Dr. Listemann had been intriguing with Bais Ali and other disaffected Khans. They also proved the existence of a widespread plot, organised by Herr Kardoff, the German Charge d'Affaires, for a general attack to be^ made on British representatives and communities throughout Persia in the Spring. Muwaqqar-ud-Dowleh, the Governor of Bushire, was very indignant at the arrest and deportation of the Germans. Wassmuss and the pro-Germans used it as an additional lever to work up anti-British feeling among the tribes of the hinterland. Mirza Muhammad Khan, Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, Khan of Borasjun, whose proclivities were well known and had been frequently in evidence since 1909, organized a confederacy of Khans, consisting of himself, Shaikh Husain of Chahkutah, Bias Ali of Dilwar and Zair Khidhar of Ahram, against the British. These persons began threatening to attack Bushire; they ; , also started writing insulting letters to the Governor and to the Acting Consul-General and others, a practice which they kept up at inter vals till the end of year.4 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT On the other hand, Haidar Khan, who had made himself most unpopular with the pro-Germans and 'Democrats' by his detention or Wassmuss, thought it advisable to take advantagfi of the old feud between Shabankareh and the Khan of Borasjun to make an alliance with the former. An alliance of friendly Khans consisting of Haiyat Daud, Lirawi, Rudhillan and Shabankareh thus came about. Ahmad Khan of Angali did not actually join it but remained friendly and refused to join the hostile confederacy. Things being so threatening when the time for the relief of the detach ment of the 102nd Grenadiers came it was relieved by the Headquarters and wing of the 96th Berar Infantry which arrived at Busbire on ^ the 6th April. The other wing of the Regiment was subsequently sent to Bushire and arrived on the 18th May. On the night of the 5th-6th May the Governor, who had received news that Haji Zair Ali of Tangak was smuggling arms for the hostile Khans, made an abortive effort to arrest Zair Ali. This individual and his men took up positions in and around his village and defied the Governor's men. The latter therefore asked the Residency for assistance, and the Officer Commanding 96th agreed to send some men to assist. On the 6th May, therefore, after sharp firing, Haji Ali's village was rushed, and Haji Ali himself having been wounded took sanctuary in Imamzadeh shrine. He remained there for some weeks but was finally induced, by limitation of his supply of water, to surren der to His Excellency the Governor who imprisoned him. As the hostile Khans outside had been getting more threatening, it was decided to ta^e the opportunity to occupy a commanding point in Tangak village and the other two villages near by overlooking the Mashilleh, and thus the support line was started. This was gradually improved and existed up to the end of the year ; the line guards the approach to the Island on the Eastj and runs across the Island about half a mile South of the Subzabad Residency. Meanwhile Wassmuss had not been idle since Jiis arrival at Shiraz on the 23rd March. He styled himself German Consul, and T^as soon able to get plenty of money. He at once began to intrigue with Mukhbir-us-Sultan eh, the Gov ernor-General, and with the Gendarmes. The Mukhbir, being an ardent pro- German, entered into the business heart and soul. All the Swedish officers and most of the Persian officers of the Gendarmerie in Pars were pro-German, and so were only too ready to help Wassmuss. The Governor-General entered into close communication with Ghazanfar at Borasjun, and the Gendarme officers at Bcrasjun and Kazerun became centres of pro-German intrigue. After two or three abortive efforts frustrated by remonstrances made by His Majesty's Legation at the instance of the Residency and of the Consul at Shiraz, the Governor-General and the Gendar merie drove out the Kalantar of Kumarij, who was harmless but not inclined to assist in their schemes. A succession of Commandants of Gendarmerie in Fars, Major Pravitz, Captains Pousette, Oertengren and Angmann all were only too ready to help the German ' Consul In May, the Khan of Borasjun took the opportunity to pay off old scores against the Khan of Shabankareh by helping the latter's nephew Agha Khan to rebel against him. The Khan of Shabankareh asked for and obtained help from his allies the Khans of Bandar Rig and Rudhilleh and desultory fighting between the parties went on the whole hot weather, and old Ismail Khan, the Khan of Shabankareh, was put to great expense. This fighting was useful to ns as it prevented Ghazanfar's men joining those of Shaikh Husain and Zair Khidhar in attacking Bushire, consequently the friendly Khans were assisted from time to time with small presents of arms and ammunition. Towards the end of May Wassmuss left Shiraz and came to Ahram, where he was later on joined by Bohnstorff. On arrival he began to recruit men and make presents to the two Khans, Shaikh Husain and Zair Khidhar, with whom he chiefly consorted. Under pressure from him the Khans increased the forces they had collected and got together a force of some hundreds of men at Chogadak and Gurak. On the 12th July news wasFOR THE YEAR 1915. 5 leceived at the Eesidency that a party had come across to the Kuzi Nullah, about a mile South of Subzahad, but as similar reports had been received before, Major Oliphant, 961 h Berar Infantry, Captain Eanking, Second Assistant Resident, went out with a small party of Infantry and the Presidency Cavalry escort to reconnoitre. Unfortunately they came on a party of the enemy well concealed in a nullah which immediately opened fired, killing one of the sowars' horses which in its fall pinned the sow T ar to the ground. Captain Ranking went to assist the sowar to free himself and was shot down, and Major Oliphant was also unfortunately shot on coming to the assistance of Captain Eanking. One sepoy w r as also killed and two wounded. The Regi ment; at once niarched out a^d considerable firing ensued South of Subzabad, H. M. S. ' Lawrence,' which was anchored off the coast, firing a few shells. It is believed that the sound of this helped to turn back a party of the enemy who were coming across the Mashilleh to attack the outpost here on the East. It appears that the enemy had planned a simultaneous attack on our outpost line during the night of the 12th, on the South by the party from Kuzi Nullah and on the East by a body of about 500 coming straight across the Mashilleh, but the discovery of the Kuzi party spoilt their scheme. As the result of this outrage combined with general anti-British attitude of the Persian Government and people His Majesty's Government decided to occupy Bushire pending the fulfilment by the Persian Government of the following demands:— (1) Definite steps to be taken for the punishment of the Khans con cerned in the outrage at Bushire. (2) Indemnities for the families of officers and men killed and for men wounded at £5,000 for each officer killed and £500 for each sepoy killed and £100 for each sepoy wounded. (3) The arrest and expulsion of the German and Austrian Agents stirring up trouble all over Persia. (4) The removal of Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Pars (this was understood to include the appointment of Qaw T am-ul- Mulk to act as Governor-General, and his right to nominate a suitable man as Governor of the Gulf Ports). In accordance wdth this decision, therefore, the Town of Bushire was suc cessfully occupied without opposition at daylight, on the 8th August 1915, by the 11th Rajputs acting under the orders of Lieutenant-Colonel Lane, 90th Berar Infantry, Officer Commanding Troops. The British flag was hoisted over the Town. The Officer Commanding Troops was appointed Military Governor and the Deputy Resident became Civil Administrator. It had been decided that the Persian Governor could not remain in office during the occu pation and so, on the morning of the 8th, His Excellency was informed by the Deputy Resident that he was relieved of his office and would have to go to Bombay ; he did so by the following mail. It had been intended to bombard Dilwar, the village of Rais Ali, at the same time as Bushire was occupied but, owing to the fact that H, M. S. Juno ' did not arrive till August 5th, and a large number of the crew were prostrated by the heat of the journey, it was decided to postpone this for a few days. On the night of the 9th August H. M. S. &lt;£ Juno,' £ ' Pyramus,' ' Dalhousie ' and 4&lt; Law r rence ' proceeded to Dilwar, the last two mentioned carrying a wing of the 96th Infantry under Major Win tie. Owing to bad weather it was not possible to effect a landing until the 13th August. But after this the 96th Infantry, supported by a force of the blue-jackets and marines under the command of Commander Blomefield, R.N., and Captain Carpenter, R. M. L I., with some machine guns, carried out some very successful operations against Rais Ali during which the fort was blown up and considerable punishment was inflicted on Rais Ali and his tribesmen. During the operations Commander Blomefieid was unfortunately killed and 7 seamen and marines, and one Kative officer and 5 sepoys were also killed; one Naval officer and 24 seamen and 16 sepoys were wounded. The expedi tion returned to Bushire On the 16th August.0 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT During the second and third weeks in August parties of trihesmen were very active in making night raids. The first raid was again 3 behind the outpost line used as a signalling station. No w f as , ° h ® t . h ' but this raid occurred before the occupation and P 0 * 11 ^ 8 nminn+inn raids would probably have been made even if there had been nooccupation. Between this date and the 20th August several raids were made, the houses Messrs. Gray Paul, the Bank, Messrs. Dixon, the Assistant Superintendent, Telegraphs, being amongst those attacked. No Europeans were injured or captured however, as, at the suggestion of the Officer Comman mg, e ivi Administrator advised Europeans living in residences scattered about tne Island to move into Town or sleep in the Telegraph buildings near the Head-quarters of the Troops. After the raid on the Telegraph bmiding, in which all the ladies were collected for the night, most of them left Busline. On the nisrht of the 16th the Russian Consulate was attacked and a te w snots ' fired at the French Consulate, and on the night of the 19th the British Eesi- dency at Subzabad had its turn. The party which made the last mentioned attack apparently had some men wounded and could not get away or was too late to do so, as the next morning it was found to the hiding in the nullahs near Zangena at the hastern edge of the Island. An attack was made on these nullahs by portions oi tne llth Eajputs and 96th Infantry, but the attack failed to dislodge the tribesmen before nightfall, and they withdrew under cover of darkness. Brigadier-General H. T. Brooking, G.B,, arrived in Bushire on the 20th August on inspection duty and assumed charge as General Officer Commanding on the 24th and as Military Governor on the 26th. After the arrival of General Brooking a night raid was made in the direc tion of the Town and another on one of the outposts. This raid was led by Hais Ali in person and he was killed. Bais Ali was the most active and deter mined of the hostile Khans and his disappearance from the scene was a great loss to them and correspondingly fortunate for us. On the morning of the 9th of September it was discovered that a party of 5 or 6u0 tribesmen had come across and concealed themselves in the nullahs near Zangena almost exactly where they were on the 20th August. They were at once attacked and driven out at the point of the bayonet. As they retreated across the Massilleh they were severely punished by our machine guns and charged by the Squadron of the 16th Cavalry. In the charge the Squadron Commander, Major Pennington, and 2nd-Lieatenant Thornton, I.A.E.O., were both killed. One other British officer. Lieutenant Robinson, I.A.R.O., was also killed and 2 seamen, 2 Native officers and 25 Indian rank and file. The enemy must have had well over 100 casualties, over 40 dead were picked up near Zangena and buried near Imamzadeh village. This affair gave the tribesmen a severe lesson and they did not give much trouble for some time after. Brigadier-General Brooking, C.B., was relieved by Brigadier-General Edwardes, D.S.O., on the 13th September, and returned to Mesopotamia to take up command of his brigade there. General Brooking, as Military Governor, appointed two Assistant Military Goverjjors, one for Bushire Town and one Admiuistratioo. for The Civil Administration of the Town presented no difficulties ; there was practically no crime. The population of Bushire is very quiet and orderly. The Customs, Einance, Police, and Postal Departments worked under their own officials except that the previous Kalantar (head of the Town Administra tion and Police) Abdur Reza was removed and Haji Yusuf appointed. The Persian Telegraph Office was closed : in point of fact it was useless in any case as the Bushire-Borasjun line had been cut by the tribesmen for a long time before the occupation. The receipts from the customs and the Finance Department were placed ir? the Imperial Bank of Persia and a portion expended on financing the Administration. The balance was utilized to pay one or two outstanding claims,\and it was understood at the end of the year that the indemnities forFOE THE YEAR 1915. 7 officers and men killed and other British officials who have lost their lives in the recent troubles in Persia will be paid from this balance. After a considerable amount of telegraphing the Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Fars, left Shiraz and the Qawam-ul-Mulk became Acting Governor-General. The Persian Government apparently showed a hona fide desire to fulfil the rest of the conditions and His Majesty's Government decid ed to hand Bushire back. After two or Three other persons had been nominated andjrejected, His Excellency the Darya Begi, who had been for some time on a very dubious mission in Borasjun on behalf of the Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, was nominated Governor. After a good deal of delay and procrastination and one false start, His Excellency arrived at Bushire on the 16th October and assumed the Government of Bushire on behalf of the Persian Government. The British flag was hauled down and the Persian flag hoisted with due ceremony in the presence of a large crowd which evinced considerable signs of pleasure at seeing their old friend the Darya Begi baek, and the Persian flag flying once more. Meanwhile affairs in Shiraz and Pars had been steadily going from bad , • to worse and His Maiesty's Consul had ^ n i vq'z q n h qvc been having a very anxious time and his position and that of the British Colony at Shiraz had become very precarious. Wassmuss left Ahram for Shiraz towards the end of July and, after his arrival at Shiraz, pro-German agitation became more and more violent. Several pro-German newspapers, of which the ' Jam-i-Jam ' and the ' Tazianeh' were the most virulent, had been started and carried on a scurrilous and violent anti-British campaign. The Gendarmerie, from the Commanding officer down wards, were wholeheartedly pro-German. They had received no pay for some months, and no doubt the officers, both Swede and Persian, received considerable sums from the Germans. His Majesty's Consul endeavoured to arrange a loan for the maintenance of the Pars Gendarmerie and it is understood that His Majesty's Legation supported the proposal, but it did not materialize before matters came to a head. Wassmuss, having been succeeded as ' Consul '* by Wustrow, Dragoman of the German Legation, on the 23rd August, left Shiraz for Ahram about the end of that month. The local agitation at Shiraz however, was carried on quite effectively in his absence by Wustrow the new £&lt; Consul' and the Gendarmerie officers and the 'Democrats' headed by Pakr-us-Sultaneh. In end of September a party of riff raff from the bazaars, headed by Shaikh Jaffar, a venal Mujtahid, left Shiraz under the grandiloquent self-styled Mujahidin (fighters for the faith). Most of the first party deserted at Dashtarjin and returned to their usual haunts. Eventually they were reinforced again, and after considerable delay about 60 reached Borasjun in the beginning of October. A well-known scoundrel called Ali Akbar Khurdil, who had once tried to assassinate the Qawam, was one of the leading Mujahidin. Shaikh Jaffar, on arrival at Borasiun, began to try and line his pockets and to take charge of everything, much to the disgust of Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh. Shaikh Jaffar also granted (doubtless for a consideration) the titles of ' e Salar- ul-Islam'and Amir-ul-Islam' to Shaikh Husain, Chahkutahi, and Zair Khidhar, Ahrami, respectively. The ' Mujahidin' never made any serious attack on Bushire and were a starveling lot. Constant collections for their support were made at Shiraz, but no doubt much of the money collected stuck to the hands of the organizers of the collections and to Shaikh Jaffar's; certainly not much reached the Mujahidin who gradually melted away and finally the small remnant returned to Shiraz. As mentioned previously, the Persian Government finally removed Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, the Governor-General, and he left Shiraz on 23rd September. He halted for some days outside Shiraz and finally left the neighbourhood about 30tb. September. There is not the slightest doubt that he, more than any one else, was responsrble for the disturbed condition of Pars. Although, during the earlier years of his administration, he was a strong opponent of the Gendarmes, shortly before and after the outbreak of war he heartily co-operated with them. This was probably due to his finding out that they had the same object in view, the advancement of the German cause.6 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT After he left the Qawam -ul-Mulk was made Acting Governor-General. He was violently attacked by the Democrats and pro-Germans. His Excellency and His Majesty's Consul were threatened with, assassination and were unable to go out. On the 8th September the British Vice-Consul, Ghulam Ali Nawab, was shot while walking in the street and succumbed to his wounds. On the 23rd October the Consulate Munshi and a ' ghulam ' (peon) were^ shot at and both wounded, the ghulam subsequently succumbing. It was evident that the Germans and their adherents were trying to terrorise the people into having no dealings with the British Consulate. His Majesty's Consul was endeavouring to procure some ammunition for Qawam and also to arrange a loan for the administration of Pars; and it was also agreed that Sowlet-ed-Dowleh should have the Governorship of Dashti and Dashtistan subject to certain conditions. It was hoped that the combination of the two principal local magnates, Qawam and Sowlet, who were now on friendly terms, would be able to reduce Fars to order. Early in November the relations with the Persian Government became very strained, and at one time a rupture seemed imminent. It was however averted by energetic action at Tehran by the British and Hussian Ministers and the advance of the Russian troops from Kazvin towards Tehran. The upshot of it was that the German, Austrian and Turkish missions left Tehran for Ispahan but without the Shah, whom they had hoped to take, and a pro-ally Cabinet was formed under Earman Earma. It was hoped that this coup would have a good effect in Ears, but in point of fact it had a contrary result. The Germans were roused to redoubled energy, and, with the help Of the Gendarmerie, captured Shiraz on the 10th November. The plot was apparently known only to the German ' Consul ' and one or two other Germans, Angmann, the Swedish Commandant of the Gendarmerie, and three or four of the Persian officers. Before sunrise, on the 10th November, having presumably cut the tele graph to Ispahan, various parties of Gendarmerie quietly occupied the points of vantage in Shiraz, secured the artillery park and placed guns and machine guns in commanding situations. At about 8 am . a deputation of the ' National Committee for the protection of the Independence of Persia' called on His Majesty's Consul and gave him half an hour to decide whether he would surrender with the British Colony and be taken to the coast, or not: in the latter event the Consulate and houses of the British Colony would be bombarded. Major O'Connor accepted the terms of the ultimatum and was arrested and taken to join the rest of the Colony many of whom had already been apprehended. The party, consisting or seven men and four ladies, was hurried out of the place forthwith and taken down to Borasjun where they arrived on the 18th November. They received a hostile reception at Kazerun, probably engineered by Nasir-i-Diwan, the Kalantar, who had frequently evinced anti-British tendencies, but other wise the journey was uneventful. At Borasjun the party was divided, the men beins: taken to Ahram, where they were retained as prisoners in charge of Zair Khidhar, and the ladies came on to Bushire where they arrived on 20th November. Major O'Connor and the other men were lodged in one long room and a small room at Ahram, and the Khan appeared to do what he could to make them as comfortable as the circumstances would permit. At first the prisoners were allowed to go out twice a day and bathe in a hot spring near by ; also they were allowed to receive letters and papers and provisions from Bushire, At the end of the year, however, they were still unfortunately in detention, and it seemed likely that regular communication would be cut off because Wassmuss and the Khans could not get answers to the letters which they had sent to German and Persian prisoners in India and Basrah. Meanwhile, at Shiraz, the Qawam, on demanding the reasons of all this violence, was put off with lies to the effect that Persia had declared war on England and that orders had come to the Gendarmerie all over Persia to arrest all British subjects. Owing to Shiraz being isolated telegraphically the Qawam could not get any instructions, and no letters from Mm to Bushire wereFOE THE TEAR 1915, 9 allowed through for some time. On finding he had been bluffed the Qawam collected his men and the two parties remained facing each other for some time. After a time the Gendarmes and Democrats called on the Qawam to make terms with them, but they offered such conditions that the Qawam rejected them with scorn. The Gendarmes therefore attacked Qawam, and after several days fighting, as his ammunition was running short, he had to evacuate the city, towards the end of December, and retire in the direction of ITasa. Thus, at the end of the year, Shiraz was in the hands of the rebels, and its Governor in retreat while a hostile gathering of tribsemen menaced Bushire. The rebels nominated Nasir-ul-Mulk, Governor of Shiraz, and Mansur-us- Sultaneh as Ilkhani of the Khamseh tribes in place of Qawam-ul-Mulk. To return to Bushire: nothing of much importance happened after the end of the occupation except the arrival Bushire after occupation, of the ladies of the Shiraz Colony alluded to above, on the 20th November. Occasional night raids were made by sniping parties of the enemy on various outposts. On the night of the 9th of December a rather bigger affair took place. A party of about 100 or so got through the outpost line and part of it came right up to the Cavalry camp at Imamzadeh and fired into it at close range, while another party fired at the British Residency at Subzabad; fortunately only tme sowar was killed and a sepoy slightly wounded; one or two horses were wounded.

The health of Gulf Ports has been Sanitary Operations. good except in the case of Bahrain, where there was an outbreak of plague. The outbreak originated in December of the previous year, and was con tinued until June. It affected the adjoining Islands as well as Bahrain itself. i Mohammerah had three cases of plague in the first week of April. At Bushire and at Bandar Abbas cases of plague were taken off ships and isolated in quarantine. At Bushire there were four cases, one of which was brought from Bahrain by the mail of 2nd February ; while the others were taken off the ' Sirdar ' on 17th April, while that vessel was on her voyage from Bombay. At Bandar Abbas five cases in all were taken off ships ; one on the 14th March, from the ' Barpeta' coming from Bahrain and the others from the ' Sirdar', on the 12th and 13th April. As the 'Sirdar' was thoroughly infected she was sent to Mohammerah on the 17th April for disinfection and deratisation by the Clayton Parge.

Howson held charge of the Vice-Consulate throughout the year. TLe headquarters of the Vice-Consulate •were removed to Bandar Abbas on the 8th March on Mr. Howson's appointment to hold charge of the Bandar Abbas Vice-Consulate in addition to his own duties. Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, Residency Agent, took charge of the current duties at Lingah and the Vice- Consul himself visited the place four times during the year. Mirza Abul Kasim Khan held the office of Deputy Governor till the 12th of October when he left for Bushire Local officia s. where he was dismissed by His Excellency the Darya Begi and Mirza Mahmood Khan appointed in his place. Mirza Mamood Khan arrived in Lingah on the 27th October and continued to hold charge till the end of the year. Mirza Abul Kasim Khan throughout adopted an attitude of unfriendliness and obstruction towards the Vice-Consulate and particularly towards the Resi dency Agent. The Deputy Governor performed the duties of Karguzar during the year. Throughout the year Muhammad Khaja posed as Turkish Consul and Muhammad Tahnun hold the nominal Foreign Representatives. position Of Agent to His HighnCSS the Sultan of Maskat. Both men exhibited anti-British tendencies. Monsieur Willemsens held charge as Director of Customs up to the 17th Cugtomg July when he proceeded on leave to Europe. He was relieved by a committee of three subordinates till the arrival of Monsieur Graux who took charge on the 29th August. M. Graux was in turn relieved by a committee of three till Monsieur Cattersell's arrival on the 22nd November. Relations between the Vice-Consulate and Customs Department have been most satisfactory. The Customs Department continued to collect the Land Revenue till the ^3rd May when the Einance Department Lan Revenue. con t r ol.

Early in the year His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk marched with a strong force towards Gaobandi to compel Shaikh Mazkur Khan to pay his arrears of Revenue. Three years' Revenue were overdue, but the Qawam-ul- Mulk showed a disinclination to have recourse to force of Arms and did not even enter Gaobandi. He contented himself with obtaining payment of but one year's revenue and promises of future payments. The expedition cannot be said to have been a success either financially or morally, as the expenses of the undertaking must have greatly exceeded the amount recovered from the Shaikh and he was left to defy the Persian Government as soon as the Qawam's back was turned. The town of Lingah caused a certain amount of anxiety during the year. Two incidents are deserving of record. The Customs Department decided to erect a flagstaff to replace the old one which had become unserviceable.

Shortly after receipt of the letter the Deputy Governor proceeded to Baridar Abbas and reported to the Vice-Consul that the Tangistanis had mutinied and asked him to co-operate m obtaining funds from the Persian Government for the entertainment of new guards to suppress the mutiny. At the same time the Vice-Consul received a report from the Residency Agent informing him that the Tangistanis were quite friendly and had no intention ot harming British subjects. The Vice-Consul, leaving the Deputy Governor m Bandar Abbas, visited Lingah and interviewed the Tangistani Chiefs. He was told b Y them that the Deputy Governor had ordered them to resist the landing of British troops. They further stated that the taking away of their arms and their subsequent attack on the Deputy Governor was all a farce arranged by the Deputy Governor himself. Their story seemed plausible in view of the Demitv Governor's consistant policy of obstruction and his anti-British attitude. It seemed evident that the Deputy Governor had first urged the Targistams to ffo against us but afterwads, fearing the consequences, tried to throw the blame on to his tools. The Tangistanis were however so incensed at having been played false with by the Deputy Governor that they vowed not to let him land. He sufoeeded in doins so, on the 19th September, under cover cf darkness, but was virtually kept a prisoner by them till his departure for Bushire on the 12th October. With the dismissal of the Deputy Governor order was again restored in the town. ^ , No instance or gun-running was re- Anus Traffic. ported during the year.

Mirza Ali Karam Khan, Shuja-i- Locai Government, Nizam, continued as Deputy Governor throughout the year. Relations between him and the Vice-Consulate were most friendly and he has worked energetically and loyally for -British interests. He placed all is resources at the disposal of the Vice-Consul, first, on the occasion or the attac on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's camp at Kargeh (Salag y S and again when the Britisli Colony evacuated Kerman. Early in the year a dispute arose between the Deputy Governor and the local merchants because the former had beaten a Saiyid. The merchants refused to accept the decision of the Governor of the Gulf Ports and pressed the case at Tehran through their representative in the ' Majlis , the Medhat-us- Sultaneh, with the result that orders for the dismissal of the Shuja-i-Nizam were issued by the Minister of the Interior. The Residency, howcs er, used their kind offices and arranged a compromise between the parties. The Deputy Governor carried out the duties of Karguzar during the year. Karbalai Muhammad Hassan returned to Minab as Kalantar, on the 24th February. He deserted his post, in August, when Baharlu raiders neai'ed his district and left for his home at Lingah. En route he wrote to the Vice-Consul and to the Shuja-i-Nizam askinsc them to appoint a successor. Muhammad Ali Khan, brother of the Shuja-i-Nizam, was appointed and held the post till the end of the year. Monsieur Fourman held the post of Director of Customs up to the 19th of March when he was relieved by Monsieur Guillaume who continued as Director till the end of the year. Both Directors worked most amicably with the Vice- Consul and no difficulties arose. Small parties of Kauristani robbers visited the district on three occasions. Their depredations however were on a condition o t e conn ry. small scale. The victims on one occasion were four Hindu Fakirs. On the 10th of June a party of 5 Kauristani ruffians, in broad daylight, made a determined attack on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's camp at Kargeh (Salag) on Kishm island. A servant of a member of the Company's staff was wounded and the raiders, as was ascertained later, had one of their number wounded who died a few days later. The motive for the attack was not clear. It was obviously not robbery and can only be set down to German intrigue. Only thyee weeks before the outrage the German, Herr Manicke, with his assistant, the notorious Haji Ali, passed through the Bastak district (in the jurisdiction of which Kauristan lies), and it is quite probable they bribed the raiders to attack the camp. Rewards were offered for the apprehension of the offenders and letters written to the authorities at Bastak and Shiraz, but the culprits had not been apprehended at ihe close of the year. Kauristan is a sparsely-populated hillyFOR THE TEAR 1915, tract of country lying north, of Khamir on tlio mainland opposite to the Island of Kishm. It belongs to the province of Pars and the inhabitants are noted for their lawlessness. They have taken advantage of their comparative inaccessibility and the disorder prevailing in the south of Persia to carry their depredations further afield. It should be an easy^ matter for His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk, once order is restored in his province, to punish these unruly people. The notorious Baharlu tribe raided the Bandar Abbas district in August and again in December and carried off large numbers of donkeys, camels, and merchandise. The Deputy Governor, with his meagre resources of men and material, was not able to do much against the raiders, the majority of whom were mounted, but he succeeded in recovering a considerable portion of the loot and killing four of the raiders. Towards the end of August the Baharlu raiders attacked a caravan pro ceeding from Bandar Abbas to Yazd belonging to Persian merchants. They carried off over 500 camels and 420 loads _ of merchandise^ His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk succeeded in recovering 340 camels with their loads and restored them to their owners. With the re-introduction of the subsidiary Mail service trade revived to a considerable extent and the Trade Trade ' Routes were fairly busy. Pear of Baharlu and Baluch raiders was responsible for the temporary closing of the routes on two or three occasions during the year. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company stopped their boring operations after the attack on their camp in June and no British Interests. attempt was made to reopen work before the close of the year.

On the 12th April the Bombay-Persian Steam Navigation Com pany's S. S. ' Sirdar ' arrived from Bombay plague infected. One lascar had been buried at sea and two other members of the crew were landed suffering from plague and afterwards died.

The Governor General started off early in the year for a tour tlirough the District His main object was certainly sport though, no doubt, he expected the tour to be profitable as well: he is a spendthrift and very fond of money, but, for a Persian Governor, he is a moderate in the way of extortion. He planned his tour to ta^e him round by Bam and Jimft to Aqta and Afshar and back to Kerman He halted short of Bam and the Khans of Bam and Narmashir came out to his camp and paid their respects to him there. He went on through Jiruft and, though it looked at first as if there was going to be a difficulty with the Zargham-i-Nizam, the latter listened to the advice of His Britannic Majesty's Consul, and went to meet him with proper respect. The Governor-General received him well and confirmed him in the Governorship of Rudbar. Unfortunately, before the camp got beyond the confines of Budbar, some Bakhtiaris, who entered a Rudbar village, were fired on and, in a fit of temper, the Governor-General allowed his men to make reprisals. This upset the Zaruham and he threatened to loot caravans coming up the Jiruft road. However, on the representations of His Britannic Majesty's Consul, the Governor-General soothed down the Zargham and the latter superseded his threatening letters by one promising to safeguard the road as before. When the Governor-General got to the end of Jiruft and began to enter the Aqta- Afshar country he was met by a hostile gathering of the tribes who refused to allow him to march through their country. He was attacked by their advan ced posts on the border but, the Bakhtiaris drove them in and, after demoli shing a few village towers, his force advanced to Urzu and encamped there. Husain Khan, Bukagchi, who had joined the Governor-General, ostensibly in loyal obedience, but really, simply to spy on him, here decamped and went over openly to the enemy. The Governor-General was hung up here for some time and began to find himself in a difficult position. His force had about cleared out the District behind it, he was cut off from supplies from Kerman and the country immediately around him could provide practically nothing in the way of provisions. He was in a hurry to return to Kerman, before the arrival of the German officer^, whose advance agent had already reached Kerman. He was himself ready to buy off the tribesmen, but was luckily put off by the Sirdar-i-JNTasrat and by the extravagant demands put forward by Gunj Ali Khan at the instigation of the Democrats in Kern an, Eortunately the tribes themselves solved his difficulties for him by attacking his position • and being badly beaten by the Bakhtiaris. Gunj' Ali Khan was captured, and Husain Khan only escaped with a handful of men, and was rounded up without much difficulty. The combination of the tribes was completely broken up and the Governor-General returned in triumph with his captives to Kerman. The whole Kerman District and the Baluchis were, of course, in tently watching the trial of strength between the Bakhtiaris and the other tribesmen and the complete victory of the Bakhtiaris put the whole province into a state of order and quietude, which it had not known for years. This lasted until the time the Consulate was closed in all the districts except Jiruft and a corner of Budbar so that a separate review of each is unnecessary. Jiruft and lludbar unfortunately suffered from an incursion of Baluchis in October and November and two large caravans of carpets going to Bandar Abbas were looted by them. The Baluchis were undoubtedly incited^by German Agents and \^ere satisfied that the Governor-General was too occupied by the Germans in Kerman to detach any force against them, but even so they left Narmashir alone and only attacked Jiruft which had no Bakhtiaris in it. The first half of the year in the Kerman city was not marked by any Kerman City. event of importance. Prices were high / and trade was dislocated, but people had got ^ used to the new state of affairs The Governor-General left, in the early Spring, to tour through the Districts and the Kermanis waited with interest to see how his visit would be taken in Eudbar by the Zargham. who had a strong inclination towards repudiating the authority of the Governor -General and in Aqta-Afshar by Gunj Ali Khan into whose district no official had entered for some years except by special permission. None of the Kermanis20 PERSIAN QTTLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT were particularly attracted by the Bakhtiari Governors they had had imposed upon them before and the Sirdar Zafar's avowedly pro-British sympathies were particularly distasteful to the Democrats, so that there was more than a sneaking hope that his tour might end disastrously for him. The ^ Democrats sent letters to Gunj Ali Khan encouraging him in his opposition to the Governor-General and, when the latter returned to Kerman with his Bakhtiaris flushed with their complete victory over the combined tribes, tbey felt very nervous and subdued. While the Governor-General was still held up by Gunj Ali Khan, the advanced agent of the Germans, one Daud Ali Khan, a temporary Muhammadan but really a Bengali Babu, had arrived in Kerman and had been given a most enthusiastic reception by the whole town. Shortly after the Governor-General's return the two Germans, Messrs, Zugmeyer and Greisinger arrived. Partly from a feeling that they had rather overdone the reception of the subordinate and partly from fear of the Governcr-General the town received them with less demonstration but with much joy in anticipa tion of material benefits. The weavers thought they were going to set all the looms working full time and the rest of the people expected them to restore trade and cheap prices. All thought they were going to fulfil the Persian ideal, in others, of throwing money about with both hands. When they first arrived, the German thrust into Poland had only just begun, the Mesopotamian campaign was going all in our favour and the Gallipoli operations were ex pected to result in the opening of the Dardanelles and the fall of Constanti nople, so that the Democrats did not hope to do more than annoy the Russians and British in Persia by a display of pro-German feeling. But the German advance and Prussian retreat developed on a large scale, there was a long pause in Mesopotamia and then a British set-back, and the Gallipoli operations came to a deadlock. The Germans in Kerman had made it quite clear that the Governor-General was not disposed to allow his pro-British inclinations to commit him definitely to the unpopular and possibly losing side, and gradu ally the Democrats began to see much greater possibilities. The Karguzar was their leading spirit and they backed up the Germans in their systematic under-mining of the Govern or-General's authority by adding local pressure to make him give way before each fresh aggresion of the Germans. The Germans disappointed all the bright hopes of the general populace. They only spent their money on surrounding themselves with cut-throats and bullies who became the terror of the town, or in bribing bad characters to try and raise riots, and, in a few months, the ordinary Kermani was very sorry that they # had ever come. They however served the purpose of the Democrats by puttin'o* the turbulent and disorderly element completely in the ascendant and the rest of the town into aumb fear, while the Governor-General refused to join, but was unwilling to oppose them. There had been a certain amount of coming and going of Germans and Austrians between Kerman and Yazd and Ispahan, but no large number of them had remained in the vicinity till Novem ber when a party of over thirty, with about seventy Persian levies, arrived in Yazd They forcibly requisitioned medical stores and instruments from, the Missionary hospital but, at first, they did not otherw ise molest the British Colony or display any aggressive intentions. But nearly a month after their arrival they suddenly one day seized the Bank and Telegraph Office and confined the Europeans to their own houses. This spurred on the Kerman Democrats who felt satisfied that they had command of the situation and were afraid of losing it to the Germans if the Yazd party came on to Kerman, and so they deter^ mined to push the matter at once. They knew that the Governor-General had solemnly promised His Majesty's Consul that he would protect the Europeans, and they wished to avoid a collision with the Bakhtiaris. Their object therefore was, if possible, to get the Europeans out of Kerman without attackmg them and tney desired to demonstrate to the Governor-General and to the Europeans that they were prepared to go to extremes, if necessary, and that the Europeans had better quit. With this object they decided to murder P eiso ^ s wll0 5 tnough not actually Europeans, were sufficiently identified w ith them to make it clear that their removal was a warning to the Europeans. These hu) persons were larukh Shah, a cousin of the Ao-ha Khan and HussajnofF, the Agent m Kerman of Castelli Brothers. Both had alread'y in clined the enmity of the Democrats and had been warned that their lives wereFOE THE TEAR 1915. 21 in danger. Famkh Shah was a British subject and was only on a visit to Persia, but his family formerly belonged to Kerman, and the garden in which the British Consulate was first established and which is now its next door neighbour originally belonged to the then Agha Khan. Some of the Shaikhi Mullahs were connected with the family and it was because Earukh Shah in his intercourse with them urged them to use their influence to detach the people from the Germans and Democrats that he had incurred the enmity of the latter. Hussainoff had, from the commencement of the democratic movement, been an anti-Democrat and was an avowed pro-ally. Farukh Shah was inveigled into a trap and two shots fired into him at close quarters from which he only survived about one hour. Hussainoff was more fortunate, the men placed on the roof of the bazaar to shoot him as he went to his office, only managing to break his arm. On the urgent representations of both Consuls the Governor-General telegraphed to Tehran repeating his previous requests for definite orders to take action against the Germans and Democrats and for the removal of the Karguzar and the Gendarmerie. The Central Government at last began to realise that things were serious and sent orders of recall to the Gendarmerie and the Karguzar. It was, however, too late now for either the Government or the Governor-General to make any pretence to authority, they neither had any left. The Karguzar, having already laughed at two orders of dismissal, was not the least perturbed. The Gendarmes pretended obedience to the order and made a show of prepara tion for departure, but they never really intended to go at all. The Democrats knew that they could dictate their own terms to the Governor-General with the sole reservation of the safety of the European community and they proceeded to do so. They closed all the bazaars and ordered a general rally in the Gendarmerie barracks. From there they sent the following demands to the Governor-General. Firstly, the retention of the Gendarmes; secondly, the immediate departure of the British and Russian subjects from Kerman ; thirdly, the handing over to them of the Bank, British Telegraph Office, the Mission Hospital and Mission School. The Governor-General capitulated completely. He informed the British and Russian Consuls that he had ceded to the above demands of the Democrats and that they must be carried out. In fulfilment of his promise to His Majesty's Consul he undertook to provide an escort of his Bakhtiaris to conduct the Earopeans in safety to wherever they wanted to go but insisted they must go without delay. There was therefore nothing to be done except to comply. The Bank, Telegraph and Mission institutions were taken over by the Democrats and the Europeans proceeded to save such of their belongings as they had time to pack, or any reasonable hope of being able to carry away. With this they all collected in the British Consulate, except the Russian Consul and his Cossacks, who remained in their own Consulate. The local authorities collected all the camels, mu^s and donkeys which were to be had locally and with this miscellaneous transport and an escort of over two hundred Bakhtiari sowars the joint British and Russian communities made the first march on the road to Bandar Abbas on the 17th December. Next day the greater part of the escort returned leaving only 100 sowars under whose protection the caravan continued its march to the coast. Erom reports received on the road, the depirture of the Europeans did not immediately restore peace and quiet to the City and the Democrats appear to have kept the shops closed for some days while they settled up accounts with others who had shown anti-democratic sympathies, but nothing of any importance happened before the end of the year. As reported last year, the main body of the Gendarmerie was ordered to The Gendarmerie, ShiraZ ea;1 y in the y ear and 0nl y a Persian officer and 60 men left in Kerman. This Persian officer was a rabid Nationalist and pro-German and took such an active part in politics that His Majesty's Consul had to ask for his transfer. He was ordered to Shiraz but his successor, though abstaining from any open part in politics, was equally pro-German and, from the time that they first arrived, the Germans were able to make use of the Gendarmerie as if they belonged to them. German caravans went to Yazd and returned to Kerman under Gendarmerie escorts; at the time that it looked as if the Germans had gone too far and that the Bakhtiaris would attack them, the Gendarmerie went22 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT over and helped to garrison the German house. They professed to be neutral and loyal to their Goyernment until the order came for them to leave^ Kerman, but then they definitely joined the Democratic rebels and went into open mutiny. Mr. Lecoffre was the head of the Department at the commencement of the year and continued to work on his own Ee\enue Department. lines. He attempted to revise the assess ment of the tax on animals, which is une of the items of the General Agricul tural Assessment and, because it was only one item, he seemed to consider that his own decree was sufficient, though in a number of cases it meant nearly doubling the total assessment payable. This naturally raised a storm, and nearly all the villagers within a forty mile radius streamed into bast in the Persian Telegraph office and remained there until their representations to Tehran elicited orders for the restoration of the status quo. In June the Minister telegraphed to His Majesty's Consul offering to recall Mr. Lecoffre and to send a good man in his place. His Majesty's Consul gladly accepted the offer and, after a very leisurely winding up of his official and private affairs, Mr. Lecoffre departed for Tehran. He handed over charge to Mirza Ismail Khan, a well-educated Tehrani with good financial abilities but without sufficient character and firmness to successfully administer the department. Consequently the revenue of the Province suffered. The opium tax was always unpopular in a district in which about 90 per cent, of the people are opium smokers, and therefore difficult to collect. Mirza Ismail Khan simply let it go. Other payments which should have been realised he with equal equanimity wrote eff as un-realisable and prepared a budget statement anticipating a deficit of some tomans 30,000. Several months he was only able to find the salary of the Governor-General by getting the Manager of the Bank to discount bills for him. These he had been able to meet up to December, but the Treasury was empty and nothing coming in when the Democrats took charge of affairs. A gentleman from Kurdistan was appointed to succeed Mr. Lecoffre but he had only got as far as Ispahan by December and it is not likely that he ever took up his appointment. The Moham-ul-Mulk successfully held the post of Karguzar throughout The Karguzari. y ear although three times dismissed. At the end of ths last year his dismissal was being urged by His Majesty's Consul in Tehran, but the order was dis regarded by the Karguzar and tacitly passed over by the Foreign Minister. In response to repeated complaints from European Pirms and further repre sentations from His Majesty's Consul, an order was passed making Habibullah joint Karguzar but, as the Moham-ul-Mulk put him in another room when dealing with cases, the arrangement was not a success. No Pirms would have anything to do with the Karguzari and, so far as the commercial community went, there ceased to be a Karguzar. Put the Moham-ul-Mulk was the most active and able Democrat in Kerman and his influence politically was most injurious. Repeated and urgent complaints from the Governor -General and His Majesty's Consul were so far successful that a telegram was again sent to the Moham-ul-Mulk ordering him to return to Tehran. This he simply put in Ins pocket and, when asked by the Governor-General whether he had received it, he practically told him to mind his own business. Tehran took no steps to enforce the order and it simply did harm and further weakened the authority of the Central Government. The third dismissal was, as already recorded, in December but as the Democrats were then in open rebellion against the Central Government it was more than ever hrutum fulmen. When the Luropean community returns to Kerman the Moham-ul-Mulk will probably be found still sitting m the Karguzari. Dr. Chiriaiefi held charge of the Russian Consulate throughout the year.

Gunter was in political Personne1, charge of the Mekran Coast during the year. It will appear from the reports already submitted that the quantity of arms and ammunition imported into Persian Mekran during the year was 1,243 rifles, 10 Mauser pistols and 107,475 rounds of ammunition. The Afghans, except in a few instances, confined themselves to obtaining the arms locallv throusrh the Baluchis. i o The extension of the period for which extra subsidies had been granted to Sirdars Saiyid Khan and Islam Khan for the suppression of the arms traffic, expired on the 1st October 1915. In November, the Native Assistant at Gwadur reported that some Rinds of Mekran, with concealed arms and ammunition from Mohammerah, were travelling by S.S. ' Barpeta'. Information was given to the Political Agent at Maskat and the men were searched on the arrival of the steamer at that port and 30 concealed rifles and 9,670 rounds of ammunition were found. On the 23rd February over a hundred Baluchis from Dashtiari left for India PersiaD BaiuchiBtan. Pf 1 S.£ ' ChakdaraSubsequently about ntty more left. Oppression by Mir Din Muhammad was said to be the cause or the exodus. A quarrel occurred, in March, between Mir Islam Khan's and Mir Hoti's men of Lashar which, after resulting in hostilities, was settled by the media tion of Mehrab Khan, eldest son of Saiyid Khan. The trouble originated in an attempted theft by Mir Hoti's men of five camel loads of cloth owned by the subjects of Mir Islam Khan. On 17th April, when returning to Karachi after a tour of inspection, information was received by me at Gwadur that Khalifah Khair Muhammad (who had lived in Mekran for a long time) had adopted a hostile attitude towards the British Government and that his men had attacked Jask Station and cut the telegraph line. I returned to Jask in I. G. T. S. ' Patrick Stewart' calling at Charbar on the way to despatch letters to Saiyid Khan. From Jask letters were despatched to Mir Islam Khan and Mir Mustafa Khan who were in the neighbourhood telling them to come and see me. They mot me at the entrenchment outside Jask. Their manner was quite friendly but Islam Khan asked for arms and ammunition and said that without them he could not jestore order. Khaufah Khair Muhammad from Jask to Charbar destroyed the telegraph line on the way, and then attacked Charbar Station. The attack was repulsed with the loss of one non-commissioned officer and four men killed and one man wounded. The enemy lost 12 killed and 12 to 15 wounded. A detailed account of this disturbance is given in a report by Mr. F. Pinsent Assistant Superintendent, Jask Sub-Division, a copy of which was forwarded with this office letter No. 332-1'., dated 9th August 1915 torwaided Por the help he gave in restoring order in the Jask District Mir Barkat was returned his security of Rs. 3,000 and was given a present of 10 rifles 2,000 rounds ammumtion and Ks. 500 cash. With the approval of the Poli tical Resident m the 1 ersian Gulf the Telegraph subsidies for the line from Jask to Charbar were not paid during the time the line was intermnted In •' u nc Baluch Chiefs named Amin Khan, Ibrahim Khan, Dost Muhammad Khan Mehrab Khan and Abdullah Khan of Dizak and Irafshau made an incursion into Priti s h Mekran with 500 men. The enemy came fnto contact /FOE THE YEAR 1915. 25 with 80 men of the Mekran Levy Corps under a non-commissioned officer at Dasht. The raiders were attacked and eventually retired abandoning some of the looted property and leaving 16 dead including Amin Khan, brother of Mir Bahrain Khan of Bampur. They carried off a quantity of booty. In July news arrived that Mir Bahram Khan was collecting a consi derable force with the object of attacking Charbar or British Mekran. It was also reported that Khalifah Khair Muhammad and a band of Afghans would co-operate with Bahram Khan. The information was confirmed by subsequent reports which said that preparations upon a large scale were being made. It was reported, towards the end of August, that Bahram Khan had left Bampur with a large following. The advance guard of the hostile force arrived at Sarbaz in early September. The destination of the raiders was not known until the main body invaded British Mekran and engaged the Mekran Levy Corps at Goomazi, on the 23rd September. The surrounding country was looted. A detachment of the enemy's force came to Ankaroo, eight miles from Gwadur, where they killed some Baluchis and plundered the place unopposed. Preparations for the defence of G-wadur were made by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, who went therein his yatch bringing a Maxim ^un and some Arab sepoys. He ordered the construction of a wall^ to protect the town against the raiders. The enemy, repulsed by the Jsazim s forces, retired to Pishin and thence returned to Bampur. When the raid was m nrooress Sirdars Saiyid Khan, Islam Khan and Nawab Khan, Bamen, collected ^ force of about 2,000 men which, under the command of the two latter, was despatched to Sarbaz. Authentic details of the action they took ^ against Bahram Khan are not forthcoming but it seems that their timely^ action had an effect in hastening Bahram Khan's retirement. In recognition of^ their action, Ks. 1,000 each was given to Saiyid and Islam Khan and Rs. 500 to Nawab Khan. The first two were also supplied with some ammunition to enable them to check Bahram Khan. On the 9th September news was received to the effect that fighting bad occurred near Charbar between Mahmud Khan s and Din Muhammad s men. The trouble was due to the murder of the former's 'Wazir, Murad, by some of the men of the latter chief. The result of the fighting has not been reported. At the end of November Khalifah Saiyid Muhammad, an Afghan ^ who has for many years lived at Debai, landed at Gunari with^ 53 cases said to contain arms and ammunition. He has not yet revealed his intentions. He is at present at Namurdi in the Biaban district. No nrosress has been made towards the settlement of the claims against ^ &amp; the chiefs and people of the Persian ' cuim8 ' Baluchistan on the part of the British subjects, the majority of which claims have been pending for some years.

PINSENT'S EE PORT ON THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTPtY BETWEEN JASK AisD BAHU DISTRICTS. This district, which extends from Malakani Chedag to Koh Mobarak, approximately 1,300 square miles, is ja^k is.nct. under the joint control of Mirs' Mustafa Khan and Hoti, the latter playing a very small part in the administration of the district, and the former, w T ho is the senior chief, depends a great deal for assistance on his younger brother, Mir Barkat of Biaban, in times of trouble. Both Mustafa Khan and Hoti are kindly and well disposed men, but these qualities in Persian Baluchistan do not work well. What is required is a strong man capable of anything to be a success in this part of the world. The year under review has been rather an unsettled one. The well known Khalifa Khair Muhammad played a prominent part in the disturbance round about Jask Station, in April last, in which our outposts outside the telegraph limits were attacked in the early hours of the 7th of that mouth by the following collected by him, resulting in the retirement of the Khalifah and his men on to Charbar wrecking the telegraph lines between Jask and that station in their journey east. Grave doubts at that time were entertained of the loyalty of Mirs. Mustafa Khan and Hoti. Rumour had it that the jihalifah ^as encouraged by them and that they were fully aware of the gravity of the situation, but, in my opinion, they were powerless to interfere, the Khalifah being too influential and, taking advantage of being considered a holy man, carried the country with him. In the Jask district the people of Gabreg rendered the Kbalifnh most assistance in the destruction of the telegraph wires, €nd it is said that 5 out of the 12 killed on the enemy side during the attack on Charbar Station, in May last, were inhabitants of this sub-district. Telegraphic communication in the Jask district was only restored after Mir Barkat of Biaban came to the assistance of his elder brother Mustafa. It is doubtful whether the latter would have been strong enough to assist our working parties without outside help. Mir Chiragh Din, the eldest son of Mustafa Khan, has, on the whole, been behaving well. Up to very recently he was considered to be one likely to give trouble but seems to have settled down of late His only grievance at present being that he considers he ought to have received some recognition for past services, and his exclusion from the list of chiefs recently rewarded by the Intelligence Officer is a sore point. In October 1912, Chiragh Din, under the instructions of the then Intelligence Officer, intercepred the passage of arms through his district (Yekdar) by some Karwani gun-runners, resulting in the capture of the arms, which were handed over to the authori ties at Jask, and the death of one of the Karwanis. A blood feud followed in consequence of the above action and several attempts were subsequently made on Chiragh's life by the relations of the deceased man, which only ceased after the payment of a fairly large sum as blood money. Eor this, I am given to understand, Chiragh Din received a couple of rifles as a reward and^ in my\ POE THE YEAR 1915. 29 opinion, should have been includod amongst the recent recipients of our Government's generosity. If it is not too late, I recommend a payment of Es. 200 to Chiragh Din, which will go a long way towards removing any grievance he may have. Mir Barkat is the head of this important district and has, with the recognition of the Persian authorities at Eiaban Distnct. Bandar Abbas, firmly established himself, ruling the people in a manner that commands respect and the only one that works satisfactorily in Persian Baluchistan. The anticipated trouble, in consequence of the killing of Mir Haji, the former Governor of Eiaban, in a light with Barkat's following has not materialised. Barknt, with the assistance of Mhza Khan of Eudbar, has settled the matter quietly by recognising the eldest son of the late Mir Haji as the headman of one of the sub-districts of Biaban and compensating the other members of the family. At the time of writing the relations between Barkat and the Persian authorities at Bandar Abbas and Minab are strained owing to the chief declin ing to pay the annual subsidy due to the Persian Government. His contention is that he does not see why he alone should be made to pay when no one else in Persian Baluchistan does and has not paid for years past. This, so far as chiefs like Sirdar Saiyid Khan of Gaih, Islam Khan of Bint and other prominent men are concerned, is correct. They have not paid revenue to the Persian Govern ment for a considerable number of years. Barkat says he does not recognise the present Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas or any one at Minab. He is responsible to the Persian Governor of the Gulf Ports and will settle with him when he orders payment to be made. The Taharzai tribe of the Biaban district, in revenge for two of their people being killed at Minab. recently murdered the Baluchi Mudir of Customs at Kuhistak. The Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas despatched a small follow ing with the intention of punishing the offenders, but for some reasons the party returned to headquarters after reaching the Perso-Baluchistan frontier. The advent of the Khalifah of Debai in this district is one of interest and one that will probably lead to serious consequences if he is ill-disposed towards us; but, at the time of writing, reports received from Namurdi, where the Khalifah is in residence, it would appear that immediate trouble need not be anticipated. At present the man is engaged in advertising himself by granting interviews to any one who wants to see him and is endeavouring to create a good impression. He is credited with being able to walk on live coals without being burned, sticking skewers into different parts of his body and stabbing himself with a dagger without injury to himself. One trick of his and one which up to date has not been tried by any one, is that he guarantees a rifle to be harmless even if loaded with modern ammunition. His object is to get some one to fire at close range at another and he guarantees no harm will result. So far I believe no one has been confident enough to take him up, but once it is tried and success follows, I am afaid the Khalifah will be in a position to do anything: he wants—bad or good—with all classes of Baluchis. In a conversation with Barkat's Wazir, I asked Mm if it was not possible for his Sirdar to remove the Khalifah from the Biaban district and ^ his reply was that it is impossible for anyone in Baluchistan to do so as he is a Saiyid and is considered a holy man. Hence I conclude that offering a reward of even six figures would not produce satisfactory results. In my opinion it is not possible to predict what the ultimate results of the Khalifah's visit to these parts will be, but it is quite safe to assume that his powers are practically unlimited and that, if his intentions are evil, the future will be one of trouble. The important district of Bashakard is now under the control of Mir Muhammad Khan, who with the assistance of Mirza Khan of Eudbar and Barkat Khan of Biaban, is carrying on quietly. Nothing of interest concern ing this district has come to light.80 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Sirdar Saiyid Khan is the ruler of this the largest district in Persian Baluchistan. He has hitherto been consi- Gaih District. dcred the strongest and most influential chief in these parts, but it would appear that his authority is fast on the wane owing to his opium smoking habits; and it is also said that since the death of his eldest son, Mehrab Khan, this chief takes little or no interest in the affairs of the country. His advisers are Islam Khan of Bint, Shai Dost Muhammad Khan, his uncle, and one of his younger brothers. The news from Bampur has been scanty and unreliable and nothing of interest has come to hand. Sirdar Saiyid Khan is still the Governor, but of late he has spent the greater part of his time in Gaih leaving others to administer the country. German agents are reported to be in Bam but so far their influence in Persian Baluchistan has not made itself appreciably felt and it is hoped the more influential chiefs will prevent them from coming near the coast. Sirdar Islam Khan of Bint is the coming man and it is quite likely he will, sooner or later, assume control of Gaih, Kusserkand and other places if Saiyid Khan does not interest himself more in the affairs of the country than he has done within the past few years. This chief is considered by some as one whose loyalty is in doubt and this was increased by the chief's behaviour during the time Khalifah Khair Muhammad was giving trouble last summer but, if his conduct was considered unsatisfactory then, it certainly has improved within the past few months and I think he can now be depended on to act in our interests. Sirdars Mahmud Khan and his nephew Din Muhammad Khan share this Dashtiar; district. The ill-feeling which has existed for many years still continues between uncle and nephew. The latter murdered his uncle's Wazir last summer and this has added to the bad relationship Rum ours of impending trouble between these two men are periodically being received and, in my opinion, the younger man, who is much the stronger, will before long oust his uncle from Dashtiari and assume control of the whole district. This place is under the dual control of Mirs Ashraf Khan and Ahmad Ballu Khan and as these chiefs have been living on peaceful terms nothing of interest has occurred in their district during the past year. The exportation of slaves from the Mekran to the Arab coast has practi- Genei . al cally ceased, no cases having been brought to my notice during the past year, but slaves^continue to change hands in the country. The rainfall this winter has been scanty and irregular and what has fallen is too late for the Tvheat crop, jowari being the only cereal likely to grow in any quantity. Last year the rains were plentiful in the earlier part of the season and scanty towards the end, resulting in the partial failure of both the wheat and jowari crops. Thus semi-famine conditions prevail throughout the country and the suspension of the steamer service from India is making conditions harder for the people as it is impossible for the merchants to import foodstuffs. Tne war continues to be the subject of interest to every one and, from what I can gather, ^he interest taken in the operations in Mesopotamia far outwei a h anything in connection w T ith Germany. The people appear to be imbued with the idea that the British Government was the aggressor, so far as Turkey was concerned, and that we are entirely to blame for the campaign in Mesopotamia. The sympathies of the country are with Turkey all the way, and any news, particulaily if unfavourable to us, is of the greatest interest and very agreeably received by the people.

The Turkish column with Ghazban crossed the Karkeh about the middle of Pebruary and came in contact with our patrols. On the 19th, the awi, Tvho were moving towards Ahwaz, were repulsed by Shaikh Hanzal s torce, but the Chaab, under the guidance of the Mullah Saiyid Jabar, shortly aftei joined them and threatened Ahwaz from the South-East. To guard against an attack on the refinery by the Chaab, a detachment of 100 rifles was posted at Abadan. Bv the first week in March a force of about 4,000 Turks with a large o-athermg of Arabs had established itself about 10 miles west of Ahwaz. The disaffected Bawi had occupied Wais, and a mixed force of Chaab, Bawi, and Mirs from Jarrahi threatened Nasiri. On the 3rd March a reconnaissance made in force from Ahwaz met with an overwhelming body of the enemy and though inflicting 500 or 600 casualties, themselves suffered severely. The following month, after the battle of Shaiba, the Turkish force withdrew from the neighbourhood of Ahwaz and the situation began to impiOAe. ^ A strono' column was sent to operate in the country w r est of the Karun which inflicted severe punishment on the Beni Turf. The Shaikhs of this tribe were exiled and others appointed. The Bawi made their submission to the Shaikh's representative, on the 5th May, and an agreement was taken from them for the protection of the pipe-line. Repairs to the latter were forthwith commenced and were completed by the 17th. Europeans returned to Ahwaz on the 9th May. Early in June, the Shaikh sent an expedition under Shaikh Chasib. against the Chaab and another one with the same objective up the Khor Buzia. These were successful and inflicted considerable losses on the rebel tribes. The latter then made submission, with the exception of an insignificant number, w ho together with some of the Mirs of Jarrahi fled to Eamuz under Bakhtiari protection. M ost of them have since returned. Said Jabir, the instigator of the Chaab rebellion, finally made his personal submission in December. In August the Shaikh prepared and embarked a force to be sent to the assistance of Haidar Khan of Haiyat Daud. Their despatch was eventually found to be unnecessary. The Shaikh however during the course of the year despatched two large consignments of arms and ammunition of his own for the arming of friendly tribes in connection wdth disturbances about Bushire. In October, in consequence of a religious agitation at Behbehan, instigated by Saiyid Isa and financed with German money, there was a gathering of Mujahidin whose intention it was reported, w as to march on Lirawi. The Shaikh of Mohammerah dispatched a strong force cf Arabs to his frontier at Jarrahi and Hindijan, and owing to this and internal dessensions amongst the agitators, the matter came to nothing. ^ A squadron of cavalry was detached from the Ahwaz garrison to remain at Band-i-Qir in August, its object being to act as a deterrent against petty raids by Arabs on the pipe line and Anglo-Persian Oil Company's camps, and inci dentally to guard against the approach of German Agents from Ispahan to Shushter. In October, Agha Rahim, Arshad-ud-Dowleh, arrived in Dizful, nominally in charge of Bakhtiari sowars, but actually to usurp the functions of Deputy Governor on behalf of the Bakhtiaris, and he at once started a provocative anti- British policy. This individual subsequently came to Mohammerah on a mis sion to undermine the Shaikh's loyalty which it is needless to say ipet with no success. The Waqar-ul-Mulk arrived in Dizful on 18th November as Deputy Governor on behalf of the Governor of Arabistan. He was however effectivelyI FOE THE TEAR 1915. 83 prevented from exercising authority by the Rais of sowars above mentioned, and it became clear that the Bakhtiari Khans, seeing the weakness of the Central Grovernment, had aspirations towards the Governorship themselves. The Shaikh's relations with the Bakhtiari Khans remained outwardly friendly throughout the year. He had however reason to believe that Sirdar Jang, Ilkhani, had instigated the trouble with some of his tribes. Sirdar Jang and Sirdar Bahadur were replaced by Sirdar-i-Muhtasham and Amir-i-Mujahid as Ilkhani and Ilbegi respectively. The latter of these the Shaikh regards as his friend and well wisher and his appointment was conse quently welcome to him. In October, His Majesty's Consul-General for Ispahan with his staff and ail British subjects resident in Ispahan, arrived in Ahwaz, whence most of them left after a short stay for various destinations. Mr, Grahame, His Majesty's Consul-General, took up his quarters at Ahwaz and remained there in charge of Bakhtiari affairs. After the conclusion of local hostilities, the Shaikh of Mohammerah's rela tions with the surrounding Arab tribes gradually became normal. The Shaikh of Mohammerah received and returned several visits with his friend Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait. When the latter died in October, Sir Khazal Khan went to Kuwait to take part in the funeral ceremonies and to help to arrange affairs. This Department worked smoothly throughout the year at Mohammerah. Charges of extensive frauds were brought Customs. against the Director at Ahwaz, who w f as replaced. Through the courtesy of the Director of Customs, all Customs formalities and dues were waived in the case of vessels proceeding up the Karun in connec tion with military operations and supplies intended for troops at Ahwaz. A British Sub post-office was opened at Ahwaz in November and a weekly postal service by launch between Moham- Posts - merah and Ahwaz was contracted for with Messrs. Strick Scott &amp; Co. In January, the reconstruction of the old line, which had only been com pleted from Borasjun to Ahwaz and Telegraphs. Mohammerah, was continued towards Shushter and Dizful. Owing to disturbances work had to be stopped and was not recommenced till November when the work was completed. Till then communi cation with Dizful had been impossible for many years. The line between Beg and Borasjun was wrecked early in the year, which has necessitated traffic to the interior of Persia going through Karachi. Except for the interruption already mentioned, the Ang-lo-Persian Oil British intent.. Company continued operations. Progress was made with the new 10 pipe line. This Company also undertook some important Admiralty work at Abadan. A new stern-wheel steamer the ' Aminiyeh ' was put on the upper Karun for the carriage of material from Ahwaz to Dara Khazina. Messrs. Lynch Brothers continued their business but were handicapped by the great calls made on them for river craft in connection with military operations. They supplied some vessels besides barges. Owing to disturbances in the Bushire hinterland, there was a great increase in imports by Mohammerah for Ispahan and Tars. The Lynch road remained open for traffic throughout the year. Owing to breaches on Persian neutrality by German Agents, it was found . T , , necessary to remove the Agents of Messrs. Poi-eign interests. ^ Wanokhaus &amp; Co. from Mohammerah and Ahwaz. Mirza Abdul Karim, who was appointed to collect the firm's outstandings, died at Mohammerah in September, and the firms effects were then removed to Basrah to be dealt with by the Controller of Hostile Trading Concerns.u persian gulf administration report Arabistan contributed largely to the military necessities of the force in 0 Iraq. The most important item was that JVlilitary Supplies. o • t or river crart. During the year Moham- merah supplied some 160 ballams and 40 mahailas for military use. His Excellency the Shaikh placed his two steamers the ' Karun' and the ' Bahmanshir ' at the disposal of the Naval authorities. Mule purchasing at Dizful and Shushter, which afterwards assumed very large proportions, was started in December. The summer was unusually hot and five European employes of the Uealth Anglo-Persian Oil Company died from causes connected therewith. There was a mild outbreak of plague at Mohammerah during the months of May and June. E. L. KENNION, Lieutenant-Colonel, His 'Britannic Majesty's Consul for Arabistan.VI ) A -v' FOR* THE YEAH 1915. 35 chapter vii. ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE AHWAZ VICE-CONSULATE EOR THE YEAR 1915. Captain J. G. L. Ranking held charge from the beginning of the year till p ersormeL relieved by Captain E. Noel, in March 1915. The latter, however, remained at Basrah as Assistant Political Officer, and did not take up his duties till June 8rd. Agha Mirza Muhammad Rahim continued as Head Mirza, while Mr. K. E. Mirz a, B.A., was replaced as Dragoman, in July, by Mr. Nadir Shah from Bandar Abbas. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Fazal Illahi, in charge of the Consulate Dispensary, was invalided to India in October. Dr. Moir of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany very kindly agreed to look after the dispensary till the arrival of Sub- Assistant Surgeon Atta Muhammad from India. The total number of new patients treated was 12,065 and 380 major and minor operations were per formed. The district of Ahwaz was first definitely affected by the war in January General 1915. No doubt Turkish emissaries and jehad propaganda had been at work some time previously, but the first visible response was the appearance of Saiyid Essa in Hawizeh in early January, which resulted in the local Arabs taking up arms and in sending contingents to join the Turks at Amara, and Ghazban on the Karkeh. About the same time, fatwas for jehad began to make their appearance in the bazaars of Ahwaz. The jehad movement once started grew apace. The Shaikh of Moham- merah mobilised the Bawi for the protection of Ahwaz but, by the end of the month, a raid on the town was considered so imminent that a general exodus of British subjects was decided on. The latter left for Mohammerah on the 28th of January by the S S. ' Shushan, ' which, .as a matter of precaution, had been taken down the rapids a few days previously. In the meanwhile it was decided to send troops to protect Ahwaz and by the 31st, the 7th Rajputs and two gun-boats had arrived. A position was occupied on the right bank below Aminiyeh. By this time, the feeling in Ahwaz itself had become strongly anti-British. On the 1st of Eebruary, Gunner Smith of the ' Comet ' while walking through the town was shot dead by one of Shaikh Chasib's ghulams. This was an act of pure fanaticism. In the course of the next few days, the loyalty of the Bawis, which had always been a doubtful quantity, went by the board. By the 6th, the pipe line and telephone line had been cut and destroyed for a con siderable distance, and the oil-fields were thus isolated. The Bawis then collected for an attack on Ahwaz but were defeated on the 9th of February by a force of about 2,000 local Arabs under Shaikh Handzal. Shaikh Ghazban and the Turks were gradually concentrating at Ghadir, 12 miles west of Aminiyeh. On the 3rd of March, our force at Aminiyeh moved out at 2 a,m ., to attack them, but finding itself heavily Out-numbered was forced to fight a difficult and costly rearguard action back to camp. As a result of this reverse, the tribal situation round Ahwaz was somewhat aggravated and the Turkish and Arab force on the right bank took up a posi tion of investment round our camp at Aminiyeh, Owing to the unsettled condition of the district, British subjects in Ahwaz, who had returned in February, had to evacuate the station for a second time, on the 8th of March, with the exception of the Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company—Mr. Gillespie—who remained in his house in Naseri throughout. He was given a guard of 50 Sepoys. F 236 PERSIAN GTILF ADMINISTRATION REPORT With the victory at Shaiba, on the 14th of April, the situation became less acute. The Turko-Arab force retreated to the Karkeh and the Bawis sub mitted. The subsequent arrival of a Division at Ahwaz and the punishment of the Beni Turuf had a sufficiently quieting influence to allow ot the repair of the pipe line being taken in hand in May. At the beginning of June, the head-quarters of the Vice-Consulate was transferred from Mohammerah to Ahwaz. During the summer months, several raids by the Arabs ^ of the Mian Ab were made on the pipe line. The Chaab of i araiyeh-i-Paisal and Haider-i- Talayil were chiefly suspected. A very bold raid in August on a camp at the top of the Tull Kha Yat resulted in the loss of some 20 mules and ether gear and led to the occupation of Band-i-Qir by two Squadrons of the 23rd Cavalry from Ahwaz. This step had the desired effect as no mOie raids took place during the year. The punishment of the Beni Turuf had a very good effect on the Arabs of the Mian Ab. During the winter 1915-i6, His Britannic Majesty's Vice -consul was enabled to visit every Shaikh and tribe of any importance between Ahwaz and Dizful, which had never been possible in previous years. Owing to the removal of the head-quarters from Ahwaz to Mohammerah, no summer tour being undertaken by His Bakhtiari Affairs. Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and, finally, the transference of Bakhtiari affairs in the month of July to His Britan nic Majesty's Consul-General, Ispahan, the connection of the Ahwaz Vice- Consul with Bakhtiaristan was to a great extent severed. Sirdar-i-Jang, the Illkhani, and Sirdar Bahadur, acting Illbegi, remained in the low country till late in May. The former's behaviour gave early cause for anxiety. Although not openly hostile, he was nevertheless strongly biassed against the allied cause, partly owing to his long-standing enemity with our Ally the Shaikh of Mohammerah but chiefly owing to his fanatical interpretation of his duty to Islam. During the months of Eebruary and March, he made great efforts, in conjunction with Shaikh Murteza of Shushter, to spread the jehad movement among the Arabs, he refused our request that he should stop Wassmuss and his party from going to Eamuz and Behbehan, and he would not agree to sending Bakhtiari sowars to protect the pipe line in Northern Arabistan. Later in the year, documentary evidence came to hand which clearly showed that Jang had actively incited the Arabs to join the A^ movement of the early spring. The Tllkhani and Illbegi met the Chief Political Officer in the latter half of May at Darreh-i-Khazineh. The object of the meeting was to obtain an undertaking from the Khans that they would remain neutral, no matter what the attitude of their Government should be. It seemed at first as if the Khans might acquiesce to our terms but, after some vaccillation, they took refuge behind the plea, that they could not pledge the tribe without the knowledge and consent of their brother Khans. Einally, however, a compromise was reached in an agreement to guarantee the safety and lives of the British community at the fields, and to afford 20 days' notice in case the Khans were unable to con tinue to protect our settlement at Musjid-i-Suleiman. After leaving Darreh Khazineh, the Khans met Haji Rais at Eamuz but without any satisfactory results from the point of view of either the Shaikh or ourselves. Eamuz continued as a recognised asylum for the Shaikh's disloyal subjects, who, issuing forth from the shelter afforded them, raided the Shaikh's loyal tribes. Not long after the Khans arrived at Ispahan, in June, a strong movement against Jang sprang up which finally resulted in his having to relinquish the Illkhaniship. Jang had made many enemies who were not slow to turn on him, when they realised that he had forfeited our good offices. Sirdar-i-Muhtasham was chosen as Illkhani and he received our support. The question of the lllbegiship was a more difficult one. The two chief candi dates we^e Amir Jang and Amir Mujahid. The latter, in spite of his reputa tion—he had been characterised in a Tehran telegram as a 'liar and aFOR THE TEAR 1915. 37 poisonous intriguer'—was finally selected, chiefly in deference to the Shaikh of Mohammerah's faith in his friendship. If Mujahid has proved at times 'difficile' on the other hand, it is doubtful whether Amir Jang would have been much better, as we have reliable information that he went over to the German cause. Owing to our having no representative wiih the Bakhtiari Khans we were the prey of a succession of alarmist rumours which, although primd jacie were exaggerated and improbable, yet were embarrassing, as we had no satisfactory means of checking them. This state of affairs was aggravated when the Consul-General and the European community evacuated Ispahan and came down to iNaseri. In this way, the rumour of a Kuhgelu attack on the fields, a Kuhgelu movement towards Bushire, German officers drilling Bakhtiari sowars, the advance of a party of Mujahidin down the Lynch road, ;\11 had their turn. In the month of December, it was decided to send Dr. Young up to see the Khans. His visit to them resulted in a clearing up of the situation and the signing of a further agreement which covered more ground than that of last May. In the early spring the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh moved down a considerable t •. j ki. • t ** i, force to the right bank of the Karkeh Lumtan aud Pusht-i-Kun. ,, 0 !!•, i i • opposite Shush. His attitude was ambi guous. 'We know that the Turks and Germans made him many promises to obtain his co-operation. Ghulam Reza Khan is however well known for vaccil- lation and it is probable that he had no intention of helping the Turks unless things were going very much against us. As spring drew to a close, he and his following moved back into the hills. Communication was entirely cut off from Luristan and no letters or reports were received from our Agent at Burujird. There is therefore little autho ritative news of internal politics of this region However, we knew that in the early summer, the Gendarmerie suffered a very severe defeat at the hands of the confederacy of all the Luristan tribes. The proofs of this were to be seen in the large number of Gendarmerie rifles and ponies in the possession of the tribes round Dizful. Nizam-us-Sultaneh is said to have pressed his friend the Wali to punish the tribes responsible for the attack on the Gendar merie, but the Yv r ali as usual, not wishing to take any definite line, advised the Ilyat to move down to the low country. They took the advice and appeared in the neighbourhood of Dizful as early as September. His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul came in contact with the Sagwand in the autumn and endeavoured to establish friendly relations with a view to opening the caravan road to Amara and using the tribe to raid the BaRhtiari in case the latter turned against us. He however early came to the same conclusion in regard to their general unreliability and untrustworthiness as that arrived at by all British officers who have had much to do with them. The disturbances round Ahwaz led to the pipe line being breached and , ^ _ nred, on the 6th February 1915. On the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. , ' t oi er &lt;1.1, .c t • j. 5th May 1915, the first repair party ventured out and by the 9th June 1915, pumping was again renewed. During this period, the settlement at the oil-fields was cut off, but communication was maintained by telegraph from Shushter and by a fairly regular service of runners who succeeded in getting through the Bawi country at night. In addition to the damage to some 50 miles of pipe and 15 miles of tele phone wire, the Company's sheds at Mulla Thani were burnt down and much valuable property in the way of tents, carts, mules, was looted or destroyed. The work of laying the new 10' pipe line has, of course, been much hampered. Normally, the section between the head of the 8' line at Wais and the fields should have been completed by October 1915, but owing to the requisition of river transport for the use of the Army, it was found impossible to get up sufficient pipe from Mohammerah to keep the line staff fully em ployed, with the result that, by the end of the year, only 28 miles of the Wais fields section was finished, and 5 miles of the remaining section to Abadan, as well as a good deal of useful preliminary work. The chief effort is being concentrated on the section Wais to fields as, once the 10'' and 8'' pipe lines are joined, the present monthly through-put of 8 M. G. will be increased to 12 M. G.38 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT The Company is still busy testing their property. At the close of the year, 3 wells were being allowed to flow, 27 others were capped and, with little further work, will be in a position to produce whenever required. Pour were in the process of drilling. The total is thus 34 wells^drilled or drilling against 30 at the close of the yearjil913. The woll at the White Oil Springs, after reaching 2,095 feet, was abandoned, but, as a result of further geological research, it was determined to sink another well further up the valley. In the month of September, a reputed oil show was discovered in the range of bills some 7 miles to the west of Ahwaz. Striking oil anywhere in this neighbourhood would, of course, be of the very greatest importance and would lead to the rapid development of a large field. The test well, how ever, bored 5 miles to the east of AJiwaz, failed to find oil and was abandoned at 3,'317 feet. a scheme for supplying the fields with fresh water by a 6 pipe line from Darreh Khazineh has been worked out but is not likely to be put in hand for the present. An alternative site for the pumping station would be on the Karun to the north of the fields. The two advantages of this location—shorter length of pipe line, and possibility of a water turbine pumping installation— are, in the opinion of the officials of the Company, more than neutralised by the isolation and loneliness of such a position and the consequent difficulty in getting European Engineers to stop there. A Wireless installation of the same size as that at Bushire and Basrah was w . , T . „ erected during the months of June and Wireless Instaltoc. July , It s f tuated at Naftah about 4 miles south-west of the fields. At the end of May, the question of the defence of the oil-fields was exa mined on the spot by a committee of officers. The decisions then arrived at were modified in the light of further investigations and inquiry, the final conclusion arrived at being that a Brigade could hold Naftah and the Wireless station, and would find the present water-supply there sufficient. In August, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company placed on the upper Karun a 2 foot draught stern wheeler which they had built in their ov^n yards at Ahwaz. bhe is slightly larger than the ' Shushan,' but more powerful. The location of the Escort and Dispensary and Consulate in separate houses British Interests.' various parts of the town at some % distance from the Consulate beins: obvi ously objectionable, a lease was obtained of the buildings on each side of the Consulate. The resulting concentration in one compact block of buildings is very satisfactory. The British Post Office was opened on December 7th. The necessary accommodation was found in the Consulate buildings. In August, a 3 years' lease of the Moin's 27 acre garden was obtained for the troops. During the year under review, transport was subject to continual interrupt tion, both as regards Lynch and Native Ahwaz-Ispahan Transport. forwarding, but more particularly the former. • firsfc sus P e 3 sl0n traffic took Place on the 28th January, on the occa- sion of the evacuation oi Ahwaz by the non-Muhammadan population, the resutt oi the arrival of the Turkish forces in the district.

In spite of this however the cargo handled compares very favourably, as regards quantity, with that of the previous year. One striking feature of the transport during 1915 is the use of this route for the conveyance of goods to Hamadan and ICermanshah, which, in normal times s take the Basrah-Baghdad route. From enquiries made in the North, it is fairly well established that the majority, or very considerable portion of'cargo which has gone over this route to Hamadan and Kermanshah, has been passed on to Baghdad. This cargo comprises for the most part, tea, and piece goods. Owing to the demand for transport, rates have been correspondingly highj having reached Krans 13 per Shah maund for Ispahan, and 19 Krans for Hamadan cargo (£37 and £55 per ton). E.

On the 18th September His Highness the Sultan celebrated the. 2nd anniversary of his reign. The Agency flagstaff was dressed for the occasion. The Imam, Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, continued to giye trouble even ^ „ , after the severe defeat his forces met Condition or country. . , with on the Jltn January, a mention of which was made on page 11 of last year's report. The Bani Battash tribe on several occasions raided and carried off sheep and goats belonging to the Military garrison at Bait-al-Falaj. This particular tribe gave much trouble to His Highness the Sultan and caused considerable damage to date plantations belonging to his subjects at Hajjar and Wadi Hatat. They also destroyed His Highness' date trees at Wathiya. In June, a detachment of the Military garrison encountered a party of the Battashi raiders near Kurram village and, in the skirmish which ensued from a long range, two of the enemy were killed. Two men of the village and a child were wounded by stray bullets. In July His Highness the Sultan undertook punitive operations against the Bani Battash at Qaryat. He took with him a force of Arab Askaris and Maxim guns. The tribe however unconditionally surrendered to His Highness and obtained his pardon. They also surrendered to His Highness the towns of Hail and Dhagmar. The tribe has since been very friendly with His Highness and their Shaikhs have occasionally visited Maskat. Early in January His Highness endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation between the Imam and himself. With this object in view he invited the rebel Chiefs to meet His Highness' emissary. Shaikh Sultan bin Muhammad an Nai'imi, at Sib. Only a few of the important Chiefs responded to this invitation and their demands were so extraordinary that it was impossible for His Highness to agree to them. The negotiations for peace thus came to an unsuccessful close- These negotiations have formed the subject of a separate report. In April the Political Agent addressed a letter to the Imam and his two Lieutenants, Shaikhs Hamyar bin Nasir and Isa bin Saleh, to ascertain their views and the terms on which they would be prepared to bring about a reconci liation between themselves and the Sultan of Maskat. Eor some time communications were exchanged between this Agency and the Imam and the two Shaikhs mentioned above. The outcome of these negotiations was that a meeting was arranged at Sib in the middle of September. The Political Agent visited Sib thrice in this connection in H. M. S. 'Dalhousie'. The Imam sent Shaikh Isa bin Saleh as his emissary to meet the Political Agent. Shaikh Isa was accompanied by the Imam's Qazi, Abdulla bin Rashid, and other Shaikhs with their followings. Altogether about 400 people accompanied Shaikh Isa at Sib. The Imam's emissary put forward such terms that it was not possible to agree to them and there ended the negotiations for peace. A separate report has formed the subject of this meeting. The latter part of the year has been practically quiet and no activity on the part of the Imam or his men has been recorded. The 102nd K. E. O. Grenadiers were relieved by the 126th Baluchistan Infantry on the 16th April. The latter regiment and the 95th Eussell's Infantry remained at Bait al Falaj till the end of the year. There was one death from sun stroke among the British officers in July. There is very little to be said on this subject. The Maskat Arms Warehouse has worked well during the year and His Highness has enforced the Warehouse Begulations as conscientiously and effectively as could be expected of him. There were no fresh imports of arms during the year under report and therefore the statements which usually accompanied this report have this year been eliminated. Occasional arms smuggling cases have been brought to the notice of the Agency. Eleven Afghans, who were bound for Jask and Bandar Abbas, and suspected to be arms dealers, were sent back to India in January.42 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT In May, His Highness imprisoned 4 of Ms subjects and fined them heavily for surreptitiously selling the rifles 'which had^ been issued to them by His Highness through the Warehouse during the disturbances. In November, 7 Baluchis, who were returning to Mekran from Moham- merah, with 30 rifles and about 10,000 rounds ammunition concealed m their personal effects, were intercepted at Maskat and detained at the Agency. They were eventually sent to the Assistant Political Agent, Panjgiirj with the rifles and ammunition for disposal. The public health has been good throughout the year. The Agency hospital was open for the public and the Public health and Hospital and Quaranhne. number of patieDts treated during the year was 7,292, daily average being 20. The Quarantine arrangements under the supervision of the Agency has worked well. An allowance of Es. 100 per mensem was sanctioned for the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, who is in charge of the quarantine arrangements, to be paid to him until an Agency Surgeon is appointed to Maskat. No pilgrim ship visited Maskat Fllgnms ' during the year under report.

The Hindu community who rule Maskat market closed their business places and refused to reopen until Salim Khaimri, Superintendent of His Highness' Customs, was removed from his post or their grievances were redressed. The chief cause of their attitude was the insult offered to the head of their community while in the Customs House that morning (31st August J. Saiyid Abu Saleh, a British Indian subject, who wtis in charge of the Matrah Customs, was appointed to succeed Salim bin Khaimri. The latter's appoint ment was received with satisfaction in general and British traders opened their business places. There has not been any complaint against the working of the Customs since. No complaints of pilfering were received during the year. The landing arrangements have remained in the hands of Saiyid Yusuf az Zuwawi throughout the year. Frequent complaints of overcarriage of cargo have, however, been received from the local British India Steam Navigation Company's Agents in consequence of the inability of the landing contractor to provide sufficient lighters. Saiyid Yusuf promises to remedy this but has not done so. During the year under report applications for freedom were received Slave trade. : ^ rom ^4 slaves of whom 20 were freed, 3 absconded and 1 was reconciled to his master.

ADMINISTRATION EE POET FOE THE TEUCIAL COAST TOE THE YEAE 1915. The history of the Trucial Coast ha? happily been free fiom events this year, and there is not much of interest GeneraL to record. The plague, mentioned in last year's report, as having abated, did not recur. The Pearl Market remained bad until the end of the year when it showed signs of reviving. The coast suffered great inconvenience by the stoppage of the slow mail steamers, but the merchants are adapting themselves to the changed conditions, and trade with India by sailing boat has revived. The only incident which occurred in this principality was a dispute bet ween the Shaikh of Eas-el-Khaimah and Eas-ei-Khamaah, ^ig subordinate, the Headman of Earns. The latter was dismissed and imprisoned by the Shaikh, but was eventually reinstated after Shaikh Zaid-al-Hilali had intervened on his behalf with a number of the Shehhins, who captured Earns, and insisted on a return to the status quo ante. The hot headed young Shaikh Eashid bin Ahmad continued to give trouble TT t t in spite of the lesson he received in 1914. umm-ul-Qaiwam. m i • i. Two or three times during the year he was checked for intriguing against the Qawasim Shaikhs, and trying to make a coalition against them. He persistently tried to stir up trouble by intrigues with the headmen of towns subordinate to the Qawasim, such as Hemriyyeh, Eujairah, Za'ab Island, etc. In June there was a dispute between Shaikh Eashid and the Ghoflah tribesmen which led to fighting in which several men were killed on both sides. Early in the year the Shaikh of Ajman, Humaid bin Abdul Aziz, secretly A . mari sent a slave to Debai to kill his relative m • Muhammad bin Eashid, who had been residing in Debai territory for some six years, since he was expelled from Aj man. It appears that the Shaikh was afraid of this man who had a blood feud against him. The Shaikh of Debai resented this murder in his territory and demanded apologies and an indemnity. These not being forthcoming, he arranged to attack Ajman, and called on his Ally the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to assist. His Highness the Sultan of Maskat interested himself a good deal in this affair and made two or three representations on the subject to the Political Agent: his sympathies were apparently with Ajman. The upshot of the affair^ was that the Chiefs of Debai, Abu Dhabi (represented by two of his brothers) and Umm-ul-Qaiwain (who has an alliance with Abu Dhabi) marched on Ajman. When they got to Shargah the Shaikh of Ajman came out to meet them and asked the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain to intercede for him. He apologised and paid the indemnity and was forgiven by the Shaikh of Debai and peace was restored without bloodshed. Nothing of importance. The intrigues of the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain Shargah. referred to above led to some trouble with nn. x . . 1 the headman of Hamriyyeh his feudatory, ims did not come to a head, however, till after the end of the year. The trouble with the Shaikh of Ajman has been mentioned above. The Debai. perennial disputes about landing cargo . _ from steamers and the rates for doinor PP up dunng the year. It cannot be settled, however, until normalFOB, THE YEAR 1915. 47 conditions are restored. Debai suffered especially from the absence of mail steamers. Early in the year some relatives of Bin Saud, who were hostile to him, Abu Dhabi. Salman-el-Araif and his brother Fahad-el- Araif, took refuge with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi after having been driven out of Hassa by Bin Saud. As they intrigued against Biu Saud and tried to organize an expedition against him, while in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi, their presence there was annoying to Bin Saud. The Shaikh was accordingly requested to make them leave his territory if he could not keep them quiet in it. _ They had left as a matter of fact before this letter was received : but the Shaikh took the warning to heart, and when the El-Araif brothers came a second time, in December, he would not keep them in his territory. In May, as one of the results of the intrigues of the Shaikh of Umm-ul- Qaiwain referred to above, the headman of Fujairah, who is always kicking against the rule of the Qawasim, attempted to start with an armed force by sea to join the Shaikh of Aba Dhabi in an expedition against the Qawasim. He was, however, restrained from doing so by the Eesidency Agent. Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif was Residency Agent throughout the year ; he has done very good work. i A. P.

Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman, Imam of Nejd, generally known as Bin Saud, was engaged in warlike operations against the Ajman in Hassa for the last half of the year. By November he had the situation well in hand and the Ajman retired to the Kuwait border to seek Sir Mubarak's mediation just before the latter's death. The Political Agent met Bin Saud at Qatif, on De cember 22nd, and accompanied him to Darin in Tarut Island where he had an interview with the Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, on the 26th. The Turkish garrison in A1 Beda was gradually reduced by desertions until August, when the Political Agent ^ ar * went down with H. M. S. ' Pyramus ' and ' Dalhousie.' At the advice of Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim the remainder of the Turks abandoned the fort which was occupied by a landing party. Three guns, 500 shells and 105,000 rounds of ammunition were removed and the fort was made over to the Shaikh. Colonel Grey and the Political Agent again went to Qatar in October 1915. Steps were taken during the last five months of the year to prevent the „ , Tansjistanis trading with Bahrain and, in ra e w! angw an oas. consequence, the tea smuggled into Persia only reached one-third of the usual amount.

The year's catch was average in quality and quantity. There was a consi derable rise in prices and large stocks eai ra e ' were disposed of. Over a quarter of a million pounds worth of pearls were exported, and considerable sales were taking place at the end of the year. These sales caused a somewhat unexpected improvement in the general trade of Bahrain.

The year 1915 has shewn, on the whole, a slight improvement in economic General . conditions in Kuwait. The general rise in prices, which came soon after the out break of war in 1914, has subsided to a large extent, and the only articles of which the prices still remain excessive are those which were formerly imported from Austria or Germany. The port has been wel] served by steamers of the British India Company throughout the greater part of the year notwithstanding the occasional appropriation of Company's vessels for Government work, and this fact has assisted to keep prices fairly low. Pearling prospects have brightened; but the rainfall was 2 inches 11 cents only in 1915 and grazino- was therefore poor which reduced the condition of all live stock. The acquisition of ground along the sea shore to the East and West of the town has continued, particularly to the East, and building operations have commenced in some of the plots acquired. The local Customs have remained during tne year under the same manage- Customg ment as in 1914j and the arrangements have continued to be excellent, no com plaints having been made which would lead to a suspicion of dishonesty on the part of the Superintendent. In July, Shaikh Sir Mubarak announced his desire to hand oyer the Customs Administration to His Majesty's Government as a proof of his confidence in them which might induce other Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf to follow his example; the question, with other matters, was referred by the Eesident for the consideration of the Government of India! Sir Mubarak's death, of which mention is made later in this report, has however caused the question to be shelved for the present. Some delay has unfortunately occurred in connection with the water Water-supply. condensing plant which is to be erected by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, owing to difficulty in effecting shipment of metals, etc., from England during the war. News has How arrived of the shipments having been made, and the Company have undertaken to have the plant in working order before the com mencement of the hot weather, which latter is naturally the season in which most trouble occurs on account of scarcity of drinking water. The long hoped for Kuwait Post Office was opened in January 1915 and Posts and Telegraphs. ' j 8 of 1 ^ uc . h advantage to the community. Irregularity in mail arrangements with Basrah and certain Gulf Ports has caused difficulty at times owing to the suspension of subsidiary steamers, but as regards communication with India and Europe, etc., Kuwait has fared fairly well owing to the proximity of Eao and the constant journeys of water boats to and from the Shatt^ el-Arab. Wireless telegraph buildings are being erected, but it is not yet known when they will be utilised as no plant is at present available for Kuwait. The anniversary of the birthday of His Majesty the King-Emperor was Celebrations n0 ^ celebrated in Kuwait this year owins: to the war. The usual visits were paid by the Political Agent on the Muhammadan feast days. The number of boats despatched to the pearl banks fell from 800 or 900 Pearl Fishery. ^ 300 during 1915. This was due prin cipally to the depression in the trade caused by lack of sale in Europe and consequent lack of funds for expendi ture. The catch was therefore small in extent and sale prospects were bad at first, but towards the end of the year they improved, and numbers of52 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT ma pearls were despatched to Bombay for sale and export to America Europe. In some instances extraordinary profits were made; one pearl bought for Rs. 12,000 by a Kuwait merchant was subsequently sold by hinTfor Es. 1,10,000, and another which cost Es. 19,000 fetched Es. 50,000. Practically the whole balance of pearls in hand has now been disposed of. The condition of Kuwait town in regard to crime is unchanged; there have been no offences of any magnitude Law and cnme. during 1915 and no disturbances worthy of mention. No epidemics occurred during the year under review and the general health was, as usual, very good. Eye Public Health. diseases, particularly in children, prevail as in all Gulf ports ; these are the result of neglect, dust, and flies. _ Quarantine arrangements have continued as before without hitch or untoward incident. The Agency dispensary treated 2,831 patients during the year, a lesser number than that treated in 1914 by 605. The decrease may be attributed to the development of the Mission hospital with its superior arrangements. The following rates of exchange were xciange ' maintained during 1915, Maria Theresa dollars at Bs. 125 to 126 per 100. Turkish Liras at Es. 13-12 per Lira. Ptupees and English sovereigns at their fixed values of annas 16 and Es. 3 5 respectively.

The relations Mission of the Reformed Church of America. n/r-' 1 -. • li, between the Missionaries and the Shaikh and people of Kuwait have left nothing to be desired. It has been decided to transfer the dep6t for coaling His Majesty's ships Coal Dep6t . from Bushire to Kuwait, and a pier has been erected at Bandar Sh^aikh, near the Shaikh's coal house. Arrangements for the entertainment of a staff, etc,, are under consideration : and it is hoped that the coal sheds will be set up before long.

There has been during the past year a satisfactory increase in pro-British feeling in the town. Lord Hardinge of Penshurst, Viceroy and Governor-General of , India, visited Kuwait in H. M. S. iceroys isi. {t Northbrook' from January 31st to February 2nd, 1915. During the morning of February 1st Shaikh Sir Mubarak -as -Subah, Shaikh of Kuwait, and Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa of Bahrain, were received by His Excellency and decorated with the K.C.SJ., and C.I.E., respectively; and in the afternoon a return visit was paid by the Viceroy attended by the members of his staff after which the party visited the bazaar and the Bedouin camping ground. On Tuesday, Pebruary 2nd, Lord Hardinge inspected the Government concession at Bandar Shwaikh and the Mission Hospital. His Excellency's visit was greatly appreciated by the Shaikh and people of Kuwait. Captain Shakespear, C.I.E., whose deputation to Bin Saud, the Amir of Nejd, was mentioned on page 62 of B&gt;n Saud and Xejd Politics. 2 as t year's report, reached the Amir's head-quarters at Khafsa, about 330 miles South-West of Kuwait, on 31st Decem ber 1914, and at once opened negotiations with him for the establishment of treaty relations as desired by Goveriyuent, but, on 24th January, he was unfortunately killed in a fight which took place between Bin Saud and Ibn Bashid with whom were the Shammar tribesmen, near Atawi South-East of Hail. Exact details of what occurred have been difficult to obtain, but it seems almost certain that Bin Saud recommended Captain Shakespear to with draw to a neighbouring hill from which to watch the encounter, and that enemy cavalry there attacked and slew him, paying no attention to his protests and explanations that he had not come out to fight. The battle had no decided result, and a truce was subsequently arranged between the rival chiefs which lasted until the end of the year. Among the tribes which had collected ostensibly for the support of Bin Saud on this occasion was the Aj'man, a Bedouin community from Hassa, which failed to appear at the appointed time and was therefore suspected of treachery. Later they committed certain depredations and gave refuge to some rebellious cousins of Bin Saud known as the Araif ; and finally, in the month of June, the Amir decided to organise a campaign against them. He wisely solicited aid from Kuwait, and Sir Mubarak despatched a strong force of local tribesmen to Hassa under his son Shaikh Salim, but before the arrival of this reinforcement Bin Saud made an abortive night attack on the Aj'man for which they were prepared and in consequence was defeated, losing his brother, Sa'ad, among the killed. Later on, however, with the aid of Sir Mubarak's force he managed to compel the Aj'man to retire to the north-east and hemmed them in near the coast, a short distance north of Qatif. Here they were besieged for some little time at the end of which they were badly defeated by the Bani Khalid and other Kuwait tribes in an attempt to break through, and then, despairing of escape, opened negotiations with Shaikh Salim with a view to peace. Shaikh Salim sent them to Kuwait where their submission was accepted by Shaikh Mubarak against the wishes of Bin Saud who was desirous further of avenging his brother's death. This took place early in November : at the end of the month Sir Mubarak passed away, and his successor. Shaikh Jabir, in order to placate Bin Saud, ejected the Aj'man from Kuwait territory, and they are now said to have dispersed, the majority making for the north-west as they fear to return to their former haunts in Hassa, The campaigns described above have kept the neighbouring Bedouin tribes well occupied during the year and General conduct of the tnbes. raids have been few in number and, with one exception, unimportant compared with those of ordinary times. In May the Sammar from the Hail district raided, in Kuwait territory, about 400 camels,54 persian gulf administration report the property of certain inhabitants of Shaqra in Nejd, and their Chief, Ibn Hashid, sent an impertinent refusal to the usual polite request from Sir Mubarak for the return of the animals, intimating plainly his devotion to Turkish interests and recognition of Sir Mubarak as an enemy on account of his loyalty to His Majesty's Government. Shaikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah died somewhat suddenly at about 8-15 ri ^ . p.m . on 28th November from heart fail- JJeatn or Sir MubaraK Bin Subah and succes- * 1.4. i i • j? eion of shaikh Jabir. ur e lollowmg an attack ot malaria from which he had been suffering for some days. His eldest son and heir-apparent, Shaikh Jabir, lost no time in taking up the reins of Government. He sealed all boxes and account books that same evening, and sent a confidential messenger to the Political Agent promising to be even more devoted to British interests than his father had been and asking for the support and protection of His Majesty's Government. On the following day he held the reception, usual in such cases, which was attended by Sir Khaz'al Khan, Shaikh of Mohammerah, who happened to be in Euwait at the time, all the principal residents of the town, and the Political Agent who thus publicly recognised the new ruler. Shaikh Salim bin Mubarak, who is younger than Jabir by a year or two only and was generally supposed to have some idea of making a bid for the succession, was absent from Kuwait at the time of his father's death; and Shaikh Jabir had time to consolidate his position before his brother's return. Salim arrived at Kuwait on the 7th December, and has since come to an amicable arrangement with his brother whereby he recognises him as Shaikh. Shaikh Salim continues to be in charge of the Kuwait Bedouin tribes as he was during his father's lifetime. ^ It would be difficult to speak too highly in praise of the late Sir Mubarak's devotion to the interests oi His Majesty's Government even taking into consideration the very different treatment which he experienced from them er y ears trouble from Turkish trickery and intrigue; and his loyalty was recogmsed by a kind message of sympathy and regret sent to his familv . ^ -i 8 ^ xcellenc y ^ ie Viceroy and the Government of India. This elicited a suitable reply from the new Shaikh in which he repeated his determination to follow m his father's footsteps.

The Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf during- the year 1915. The almost complete collapse of the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf, which took place during the latter part of the year 1914, was maintained throughout the year under report. No Naval or Military preventive measures were taken during this period and the only means of supervision in th's connection was that carried out by Police Constables, one of whom travelled on board each mall steamer plying in the Gulf, in addition to their otlier duties wbich were in connection with the Police at Basrah. On the other hand the same system of Tntelliarence has been maintained and landings reported as heretofore. These landings have been exceptionally few and of minor importance. The large body of Afghans which arrived in Makran during the winter of 1914-15 went away practically empty-handed. What little success they achieved was in obtaining a few old pattern weapons bought mostly from the inhabitants of Persian Baluchistan and to a very small extent a better pattern from Batinah, Debai and Qatar by a few of the more enterprising members of the party who proceeded to these places by boat. It seems clear that the stocks of arms on the Batinah, Trucial and Qatar coasts of the Gulf are finished and that whatever munitions remain at Kuwait will be, if it is not already the case, absorbed locally. To state, however, that the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf is dead would not be quite in conformity with facts. As was pointed out in the ' Report on the Arms Traffic in the Persian Gulf during 1914 ^ one of the likely means of obtaining arms in the future would be from the Arab tribes in Mesopotamia. It appears feasible that those living in the rear of the advancing troops coald be induced to part with their own rides and would also be in a position to gather arms from a battleiield and bide them until such time as they could be safely disposed of. That some such procedure has been adopted seems evident from the fact that Turkish rifles are now m the possession of certain Baluch tribesmen and a small quantity of these weapons with ammunition was captured on board a mail steamer at Maskat being brought from Mohammerah to Pasni for transport inland. Another source of supply which must be taken into consideration is the large quantity of arms brought into Persia by the Germans via Kermanshah and elsewhere, and by ourselves. When Persia, and Southern Persia in particular, becomes a more settled and well-ordered country it would seem that there is a danger of these arms finding their way over the border unless some system is adopted w T hereby the disposition of arms is controlled. Lack of ammunition and a superabundance of rifles in Persia would tend to induce the possessors of the jatter to part with them to the highest bidder. It seems reasonable to assume also that the Afghans, finding their source of supply in the Persian Gulf cut off, will shortly make endeavours to exploit Persia and give good prices for these rifles which are of the type that they require, especially those Service weapons imported by us, and thus a recrudericence of trans-Frontier trade in arms will appear. Bandar Abbas ; ^ E. C. WITHERS, Lieutenant, R, I. M., The 10th April 2916. ) Intelligence Officer, Persian Gulf. Report by Mr. F. Pin sent, Assistant Superintendent, Jask Suh-Division, Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated Chirbar, the 1st July 1915, m connection with the importa tion of arms into the Mekran during the half-year ending the 30th June 1915. The patrol and telephone establishment has been maintained on the same scale as that of the previous half year and occasional cash presents given to people interesting themselves on our behalf. The half-year under report has been noted for the large number of Afghan traders who, without previous intimation of their movements being received, arrived at different places in the Mekran in search of arms. It was reported from several telephone stations and confirmed through various sources that, early in January, the Afghan caravans totalled approximately 6U0 men scattered over Bint, Fanuch, Gaih and Kasserkand districts. The parties quickly got to work and information of their movements in the Karwan district and other places was received a few weeks later. I addressed both the subsidised Chiefs, Sirdars Saiyid and Islam Khan, but could get no satisfactory reply from either, each chief bbmed the other for harbouring the Afghans. Sirdar Islam Khan later on acknowledged the presence of a few individual Afghans at Bint, he said they were there to pay their respects to the Khalifa, but at the same time he was taking precautions to have them watched and had warned the headmen of the ports in his district to see that no assistance was given by the58 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTEATION REPOET Nakhudas. This chief also wrote saying tiiere were no rifles procurable at Bint; qmte possibly this was true, but at the same time he avoided referring 1 to other parts of his province where it is known that the Afghans collected a large number of arms and correspond ing quantities of ammunition between January and May. The number of rities is said to have exceeded 400, adding this number to the 600 imported on 7th April 1915 and 21st May 1915 it can be assumed that over 1,000 rifles, majority of which were Martinis of sorts, have left the country on different dates during the season under report. That suitable weapons are procurable in the country and can be imported without much difficulty is proved by the number of Afghans engaged in the trade as it is very improbable these men would go to the expense and undergo the hardships of a long journey overland unless they were absolutely certain of making the business a paying one. During January and February over 400 Sovereigns were brought to the Charbar bazaar by Baluchis from the interior who were willing to exchange them for silver at a discount and a good many more would have come in if the supply of silver had not run out owing to slackness in trade. It is believed &lt;$u0 odd Sovereigns found their way to Gwadur and Maskat in consequence. Gold coinage could only have been brought into the country by the Afghans and it is apparent the traffic in arms during the half-year has been fairly brisk, the traders and all concerned in the trade taking full advantage of the withdrawal of the blockade. It was reported on 2nd February that four Afghans left Tank for Debai in a Baluch boat, Nakhuda Rahmullah, and it is said these men were responsible for the successful! landings at Giriskin on tjth April 1915 and at Sadaich on 24^ May 1915 where they were met by their friends who had been waiting in the neighbourhood for their return. A party of Afghans, numbering about 30, quarrelled amongst themselves at a village a few miles north of the telephone station at Rapch, on the 24th January, and in a fight which ensued one man was killed and another severely wounded. The wounded man was taken to Jask accompanied by six of his comrades and, on nearing that station, the injured man was escorted to the buildings by one of the party whilst the others retired on to old Jask. Their presence at that place was notified to Mir Barkat of Biaban who happened to be in the vicinity and he immediately had them arrested and sent in to the authorities who deported them to India. f l he injured man and his companion were detained for the time being and deported on the recovery of the former. Four Afghans named Khan Muhammad, Abdullah Khan, Wilayat Shah and Sadu Khan left Karachi early in January by a native boat for Charbar. On their arrival at that place they were arrested and detained. The party stated their objective was Baghdad to which place they intended proceeding after paying their respects to Khalifa Khair Muhammad at Bint, they swore they had absolutely no concern in the arms traffic. On the difficulties of a journey being represented they begged to be allowed to pay their respects to the Khalifa, after which they promised to return. The men were carefully searched and a sum of Rs. 30/ and about 80 krans were found divided among the party. The Political authorities having no objection to their visiting the Khalifa at Bint, Rs. 15 was advanced to each to meet expenses, the balance of the money being detained as security for their return. xVothing has been heard of the party since and it can be assumed they were concerned in the arms trade and thought it advisable to return overland to their homes instead of riskino- doing so via Charbar and Karachi. It is quite probable these men travelled to the Mekran Via Karachi instead of following the usual route as it is much shorter and more comfortable and that the bulk of the money they intended to invest in arms was - sent by another route. J Nine Afghans also found their way into the Mekran vid Gwadur in January last. These men landed at Gwadur from a native boat and possibly, owing to a lack of vigilance o the part of the authorities at that place, were allowed to proceed unmolested. The telephone stations en route reported their presence and movements daily and all arrangements to have them arrested in the event of the party calling at Charbar were made but after reac mg venj (1 miles East of Charbar) the Afghans proceeded direct to Parao- '(15 miles west of Charbar and disappeared travelling in a north-westerly direction. 0 nf H Th | ( 1 Afgh J m 1 . tra i df ' rs in the country were in no way concerned in the destruction Hp 1 h T p n wvf en ii i Charbar and also in the attack on the station at the latter place.

Report hy Mr. F. Pinsent, Assistant Superintendent, Jash Sub-Division, Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated Charbar, the 1st January 1916, in connection with the arms traffic on the Me/cram Coast during the half-year ended 31st December. The number and disposition of the four patrols employed remain as at the close of the last report, but two additional telephone stations have been opened in order to facilitate the transmission of information to Jask and to report the movements of Afghans interested in the trade. The period under review from the gun-running point of view has been a very quiet one and from the attached statement it will be seen that the importation of arms into the Mekran has fallen off considerably, but in spite of this small parties of the Afghans continue to wander through the different districts in search of arms as reports have been received of their presence in and about the Karwan district where it is said they are purchasing inferior types of weapons from the people of the country. It is difficult to understand 'how the business can be made a paying one as the majority of the rifles now procurable are of a most inferior kind, but doubtless a few modern weapons can also be purchased in small numbers which must be sufficient attraction to the parties interested in the trade between Afghanistan and Persian Baluchistan. The two landings of arms in August last were effected by parties of Afghans who left the coast during the previous winter for the Arab side and their late return ^shows the scarcity of arms for sale on the opposite coast. The landing of one Saiyid Muhammad, an Afghan of some standing, said to be known as the Khalifa of Debai on the coast west of Jask during the latter part of the period under review with 53 cases believed to contain rifles, revolvers, etc., is of interest, but so far nothina' much is known of the man and his intentions and it remains to be seen how far his influence will affect the country generally. A statement showing the approximate number of arms and ammunition imported during the half-year is attached. 060 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT PGR THE YEAR 1915.

Some of the reports are rather longer than is required by the last orders of Government on the subject, but the condition of affairs in South Persia was unusual during the year under review, and for this reason I did not think it necessary to insist on brevity. It will be observed that there is no note on the Arms Traffic for the year 1916. The Intelligence Officer, Persian Gulf, reports that there is little or nothing to record regarding the Arms Traffic during 1916, and that the few authenticated cases of arms smuggling are not of sufficient importance to require a separate report in the Administration Report for the year. This is a satisfactory state of affairs, which I trust will continue. I have the honour to be, Sir, 1 our most obedient servant, A P. TREVOR, Major, Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf.contents.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, but his duties as Chief Political Officer with the Indian Expeditionary Force ' D' kept him in Mesopotamia throughout the year except for two brief visits in March and N ovember. Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., remained as Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty's Acting Consul-General, Bushire, through out the year. Major M. E. Rae was First Assistant Resident throughout the year, and the post of Second Assistant Resident was held by Mr. Vice-Consul Worrall from the beginning of the year until 24th March, when he left for Ahwaz with a view to returning to Ispahan, on relief by Mr. Duncan Willey, an Assistant Political Officer from Mesopotamia, who held the appointment until the end of the year. Mr. Vice-Consul Newton Worrall returned to Bushire on the 2nd May, arrangements having been made by His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to fill his post at Ispahan by a Consular Officer from Tehran, and remained for the rest of the year as additional Vice-Consul. Mr. Vice-Consul H. G. Chick, C.I.E., was in charge of the Vice-Consulate throughout the year, and the post of Consular Assistant remained vacant. Major J. McPherson, I.M.S, was Residency Surgeon and Chief Quaran tine Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf throughout the year.

Governor i-i • n n 2/ ' of Bushire. Darya .Begi, was (jovernor of the Gulf Ports throughout the year. His Excellency made several long trips down the Gulf in connection with the murder of the Residency Agent, Lingah, and other matters; during these periods Uis Highness Sulaiman Mirza, the head of the Pinance Department was Deputy Governor and took charge of the Local Government in the Darya Begi's absence. Masud-us-Sultan, the ex-Karguzar, never returned to Bushire, and the KarCTuzar office of Karguzar was vacant during the year. Haji Yusuf, who was appointed Kalantar during the British occupation Kalantar in August 1915, remained Kalantar throughout the year. At the end of 1915, His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk, who had been GoTernor-Generai of Fftrs. appointed acting Governor-General, was driven out of Shiraz by the rebels, who appointed Nasir-ul-Mulk in his place. In April, when Qawam was nearino- Shiraz, Yawar Eath-ul-Mulk, one of the Gendarmerie officers, seized the Government on his behalf, and held it till the new Qawam. arrived, on 2 tth April. From this time the new Qawam was Deputy Govern or-General until His Eoyal Highness Earuian Parma arrived, on the 15th October. The latter continued to be Governor-General until the end of the year.

Prom the beginning of the year until the end of August business was i 0Wlng to the rebellion at Shiraz, and to the road being closed Alter that date large quantities of goods were imported until almost the end or tne year, when renewed disturbances at Kazerun again closed the road. The Pinance Department remained in charge of Shahzadeh Sulaiman Mnza throughout the year. Owing to the disturbed condition of the hinter- land and the impotence of the Persian Government, the Pinance Department has been seriously embarrassed during the year.

After the beginning of 1916 they gradually dropped active hostilities: a few shots were fired at the outposts at night occasionally at the beginning of the year, but even that ceased after April. During the early part of the year, however, while the hostile Khans were still active, the Military authorities contemplated punitive raids against them, and possibly some attempt to release the prisoners at Ahram. During March atwl the greater part of April the ' Mashilba ' or low lying ground between anji Bushire Island and the mainland was too wet to admit of guns and wheeled ino^ trausport going across, By the 27th April, however, the ground had hardened and a reconnaissance in force was carried out by the General Officer Commanding to see whether guns and motor lorries, etc., could operate on the other side. In the course of this the force was fired on by the enemy who were in some trenches near Ohaghadak village which was destroyed and the towers domolished. This move caused a good deal of excitement and alarm among the hostile Khans, as was evidenced by the fact that Ghazanfar-us-Sultaueh, Khan of Borasjun, got Eath-ul-Mulk (who had recently seized the Government of Shiraz on behalf of the Qawam) to send a telegram saying how loyal and friendly Ghazanfar was and also got Soulet himself to write to the Darya Begi in the same strain. Ghazanfar himself wrote declaring that he had disarmed the 30 Gendarmes at Borasjun. It was, however, decided that any punitive raids would do more harm than good, and might endanger the Shiraz prisoners at Ahram. Consequently the garrison at Bushire remained passive for the rest of the year and no steps whatever were taken against the hostile Khans who have so far remained unpunished. Events in the .Hinterland from this date till the 20th August were entirely connected with the fate of the Shiraz pri soners at Ahram (see below). After the exchange of the prisoners, on the 10th August, the road was opened and Tangistanis and other tribesmen (except well-known dangerous characters) were allowed to enter Bushire freely. The Shiraz road was opened and traffic soon began to pass up and down freely. On the 17th December, however, this was upset by the Nasir-i-Diwan (hereditary Kalantarof Kazerun) suddenly seizing the Gendarmerie barracks and occupying them. His men captured a gun and some arms and ammunition and supplies belonging to the South Persia Bifles, which had recently taken over the Gendarmerie. This incident, of course, upset everything and, at the end of the year, the road to Shiraz was closed and trade suspended. It was found that Nasir-i-Diwan was in close collusion with the hostile Khans, and directly after this coup he demanded reinforcements from them. Thus the end of the year found the Bushire Hinterland as disturbed as ever, but with the focus of disturbance shifted from Borasjun to Kazerun. The end of last year found Major O'Connor, and the male members of c ,. . the British Colony at Shiraz captives in _ sw pr ' 80,w ' s ; _ the hands of Zair Khidhar at Ahram. The British authorities had also some 15 to 20 prisoners, captured at Zangena, on the 9th September 1915, including Khalu Hussain, a Dashti Khan, and Zair Hussain, a nephew of Zair Khidhar. It was decided, however, that no negotiations should be entered into with the Khans for the exchange of prisoners. On two occasions the Khans made overtures for the exchange of Khalu Hussain and Zair Hussain, but these proved abortive as orders were received on each occasion that the individuals named would only be exchanged for Major O'Connor, and the Khans did not wish to waste their trump card. About the middle of April the Khans sent letters offering to exchange the prisoners on certain terms. These were, however, not acceptable as the principal condition was that the Khans should receive pardon for their former crimes. Mr. Pettigrew of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, one of the prisoners, died on the afternoon of the 27th April. According to Dr. Azzopardy, one of the other prisoners who was released by the Khans on account of illness and who arrived at Bushire on the night of 30th June, death was due to angina pectoris. B 2 POR THE YEAR 1916. 34 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTKATION EEPORT The Persian GoTernment assured His Majesty's Minister on more than one occasion that the prisoners would shortly be released either by Soulet-ud- Dculeh or some other means, but nothing resulted. The prisoners having intimated that some of them could escape, sketch maps and notes of routes were secretly sent to them, arrangements were made with certain Khans on the borders of Dashti, which is not far from Ahram, to receive them and assist them to reach the coast at some point near La war. This plan, however, did not materialise, as the prisoners afterwards decided that as all could not get away they would not make the attempt. . Later, Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connor wrote that the prisoners could seize the fort in which they were confined, and asked for details as to how soon the General Officer Commanding could have men at Ahram to relieve the prisoners after hearing of the seizure of the fort. . The proposal to send troops out for this purpose, however, was vetoed, and this plan also came to nothing. His Majesty's Minister accordingly decided that, as the severest part of the hot weather was rapidly approaching, and there appeared to be no hope of effecting the release of the prisoners through the Persian Government, it would be better to try and arrange it ourselves with the Khans. Finally, in July, after considerable telegraphing as to details of terms, orders were received to enter into negotiations with the Khans for the exchange of prisoners on the basis of the conditions proposed by the Khans, except that nothing which could be construed into a pardon should be given them. While this question was under consideration news was received that Mr. Christmas was dangerously ill, and after some correspondence and a pre liminary point blank refusal by Shaikh Hussain, it was arranged to exchange two of the Tangistani prisoners for him separately, without prejudice to the general question. This was done, and Mr. Christmas was brought in to Bushire on 2nd August. After the abovementioned refusal to exchange Mr. Christmas, Sub-Assistant Surgeon Parid Khan was sent out to Ahram to see the prisoners. He missed Mr. Christmas, who passed him on the road, but reported the other prisoners all well, though severely tried by the heat and the hard conditions of life. After considerable delay and some misunderstanding an exchange was arranged on the following terms :— (1) Khalu Hussain and the Tangistani prisoners to be exchanged against Colonel O'Connor and the British prisoners; (2) Certain monies belonging to Shaikh Hussain to be returned, and certain tea confiscated at Bahrain, which was claimed by Zair Khidhar, to be returned to him ; (3) The route across the Mashilla to Borasjum via Ahmedi, which had been closed by our outposts since the occupation, to be re opened . On the 10th August the exchange was effected, but, owing to an unfortu nate mistake, Zair Hussain was not present—he had been sent to Bombay instead of to Bushire from Basrah by mistake on the 29th July, and could not be got back in time. This naturally caused a good deal of difficulty, which was settled by Colonel O'Connor remaining with the Khans till Zair Hussain was produced. The latter was returned to Bushire on the 20th and Colonel O'Connor Was released the same day. The whole party of prisoners, except Mr. Livingstone, proceeded to India by the Hired Transport ' Elephanta ' on the 23rd August. In December 1915 the Qawam-ul-Mulk, who had been appointed Acting Qawam-ul-Mulk, Acting Governor-General of Fara G OVCmOr- General Of Pars in September, . . was driven out of Shiraz by a determined attack on the part of the Gerdarmene and tf Democrats He withdrew to his own tribal territory and the rebels at once nominated Nasir-ul-Mulk (first nominee for Governor of Bushire in September 1915) to be Governor and ' Amir-ul-Mulk ' to be Ilkhani of the Arab tribes.-*•&gt; I TOR THE YEAR 1916. Prom Tasa the Qawam sent Ms son-in-law, Nazim-ul-Mulk, to Bandar Abbas to ask for the assistance of the British Government in guns, munitions and cash. Nazim-ul-Mulk reached Bandar Abbas on the 29th January and, after a good deal of telegraphic correspondence, it was arranged that the Qawam should himself come to Bushire and consult the British authorities, and that, if he had a suitable plan for recapturing Shiraz, help would be given to him. The Qawam accordingly came to Lingah (the Baharlus having blocked the road to Bandar Abbas), and from thence to Bushire where he arrived on the 24th February. He had a meeting with Sir Percy Cox at Bushire and it was finally arranged that he should receive an advance of £50,000, about £30,000 of which was given at once, one Turkish Meld gun, 2 Turkish Mountain guns and some Turkish machine guns, together with a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition ; 4,000 rifles and 2 million rounds of ammunition were to be sent from India to Lingah for him. / The Qawam left for Lingah in the ' Persepolis' accompanied by the Darya Begi, on the 8th March. He left Lingah for Bastak and Lar on the 17th March, and had a triumphal march up to the neighbourhood of Shiraz, no one daring to oppose him and all surrendering. When drawing near Shiraz he had a meeting with the Soulet—who apparently did not wish to be believed behind hand in assisting the Government, now that their forces were getting the upper hand—and it was arranged that Soulet should co-operate in the movement on Shiraz by sending a force of sowars up from the south. On hearing that the Qawam was carrying all before him, Fath-ul-Mulk, one of his adherents and an officer of the Gendarmerie, seized the Town of Shiraz on behalf of the Government on 8th April. Unfortunately the Qawam was killed by a fall from his horse while out hunting on or about 21st April, and his son, a young man of about 25, succeeded him and was given his father's honours and position by the Persian GoYernment. The late Qawam-ul-Mulk was made Acting Governor-General of Pars in succession to the Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh on 14th September 1915, and though he proved unequal to coping with the Gendarmerie and wa.s unable to prevent the capture of the British Consul and Jolony at Shiraz, yet he was undoubtedly- friendly to the British and was bent on preserving Persian neutrality, suppressing German agitators and restoring order in Pars. His son vas quite inexperienced and somewhat headstrong, and liable to be misled by the Soulet and evil council lors in his own entourage. The Qawam's death at this juncture, therefore, was a great loss. The new Q.awam and Soulet entered Shiraz on the 24th April. A number of Germans and Austrian and ' De nocrats' were imprisoned, and a few persons, chiefly adherents and servants of the late Qawam who had gone over to his enemies, were executed. After this affairs in Shiraz soon became more or less normal and the new Qawam remained as Deputy Governor-General for the Parman Parma who had been nominated Governor-General, until the arrival of the Sardar Muatazad. As indicated above, from the beginning of the year until the middle of April, Shiraz was in a state of almost com- s * maz ' plete anarchy. The Nasir-ul-Mulk had been made Acting Governor-General by the rebels but the German '' Consul' Seiler and the rebel Gendarme officers and Democrats did what they liked in the plaoe. ' Consul*' Seller was virtual Governor and the people soon found that a German regime was by no means ideal. Most of the well-to-do people were forced to pay large sums for the local administration on various pretexts ^ If it was not possible to convict them of pro-British or pro-Pussian sympathies, they could easily be charged with being adherents of the Qawam, or of having money belonging to him or his adherents deposited with them, or of having anti-' Democrat' proclivities, etc., etc. As the Germans and Gendarmes had the power it was easy to fleece nearly everybody. Herr Koever, a German merchant in Shiraz, was made Bank Manager' and, having installed himself in the office of the Imperial Bank of Persia, collected various outstandings of tha Bank by force. People having drafts or bills due6 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTEATION EEPOHT at the Bank were compelled to pay, and the sums realised were utilised for the most part to pay the Gendarmes and carry on the administration (?) though possibly some of the money found its way into the pockets of the Germans and Gendarme officers. VYassmuss paid a flying visit to Shiraz at the beginning of the year. On the 8th April the Fath-ul-Mulk took over Shiraz on behalf of the Qawam, and all the Germans in Shiraz were arrested. Later on the German party which had been expelled from Kerman arrived near Shiraz and were also captured.^ When the new Qawam and the Soulet arrived in Shiraz, on the 24th April, there were 18 Germans, 30 Au^trians, 8 Turks, 12 Afghans, and about 12 Indian prisoners there. Soon after the removal of the Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, in September 1915 His Royal Highness the J^asrat-us-Sultaneh, the youngest son of His Maiestv Muzaffar-ed-Din Shah, was nominated Governor-General of Ears, but he never joined the appointment He left Tehran and reached Ispahan en route to Shiraz, in April. From there he sent the Sardar Munazzam to be -Deputy Governor-General and the latter arrived at Shiraz at the end of April it was, however, finally decided in May that Nasrat-us-Sultaneh was too young and inexperienced to take charge of such a turbulent province as lars, and it was arranged by the Persian Government, in consultation with is Majesty s Minister, that His Eoyal Highness Earman Farma (who had been appointed Governor-General of Kerman) and Nasrat-us-Sultaneh should change apponitments. Nasrat-us Sultaneh accordingly proceeded to Kerman w 1 e ^arman I arma remained in Tehran preparing to start for Shiraz His Royal Highness Of, pointed Sardar Muatazad to bo his Deputy, and this gentle- man arrived m Shiraz in June.

Directly after his arrival the Governor-General took over the prison ers of whom there were 18 officers, mostly Germans, about 30 rank and file, mostly Austrians, 8 Turks and about a dozen Indians, including Sufi Amba Pershad, the notorious seditionist. After the arrival of the Governor-General and the British Consul steps were taken to try and unravel the tangle into which the affairs of the Gendar merie had fallen. The Imperial Bank of Persia and Telegraph Office were re-opened and affairs in Shiraz soon became to all appearances almost normal. Various suggestions for getting away the prisoners were made, but it was not possible to send them down to Bushire on account of the hostile Khans. On the 11th November Brigadier-General Sykes w r itli his column, consist ing of one section Indian Mountain Artillery, one Squadron Cavalry, the Head-quarters wing of the 1st Battalion 124th Baluchistan Infantry and the Head-quarters and certain number of South Persia Eifles, arrived at Shiraz from Ispahan. General Sykes took over the majority of the Gendarmerie left in Shiraz and incorporated them in the South Persia Rifles, and the new force seemed to be making good progress. On or about the 1st November ' Consul ' Seller and three other prisoners effected their escape from the citadel, and arrangements were made to transfer the custody of the prisoners from the Governor-General to the regular Indian soldiers of General Sykes' column. The Governor-General proposed to make a tour with General Sykes about the end of the year to Kazerun and get the Bushire road question settled. His Ptoyal Highness had previously sent a special envoy down the road to try and patch up some arrangements along the road pending His Boyal Highness's arrival. But the envoy was not able to effect much. On the 17th December the Nasir-i-Diwan, hereditary Kalantar of Kazerun, „ .. who had previously made some trouble Kazerua rismg, ther e w ith the Swedish Gendarmerie, suddenly rushed the Gendarmerie barracks and captured a gun and some machine guns there. The Gendarmerie at Kazerun had been taken over by General Sykes a short time before. Nasir-i-Diwan's men subsequently captured Mian Kotal and Dashtarjin. A small column was sent out from Shiraz, taking with it Path-ul-Mulk to be Military Governor of Kazerun. It reoccu- pied Dastarjin and Mian Kotal caravanserai, and made a reconnaissance in force towards the Pir-i-Zan pass on the 25th December. The top of the pass was, however, -held too strongly by Nasir-i-Diwan's men, and the attempt was abandoned. Captain Wittkugel of the South Persia Rifles was unfortunately severely wounded and there were a few other casualties. Before and after this Nasir-i-Diwan sent pressing messages to the Khans of Daliki, Borasjun, Chahkutah and Tangistan, (i.e., all the Khans who have been actively hostile to the British since the beginning of 1915) for assistance. It is understood that not very much was sent but the end of the year found the main Bushire-Shiraz road again blocked, but with Kazerun the chief centre of disturbance instead of Borasjun which had enjoyed that distinction up to August 1916. As a result of negotiations between the British, Russian and Persian South Persia MUitar; Police. Governments it was decided, early in the year, to raise a lorce ot Military Police officered by British officers for service in Southern Persia. Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., was appointed to command the force. It was decided that he should commence operations at Bandar Abbas and move from there, as soon as he had sufficient force, to Kerman. On the 16th March General Sykes with a certain number of officers arrived at Bandar Abbas, where he was received by His Excellency the Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports and the Deputy Governor. H. M. S. ' Philomel ' was also present and supplied a guard of honour and fired salutes.C PERSIAN GULF ADMINiSTKATION EEPOET After a short time it was found that it T(ould be impossible to tnovfl up to Kerman without a stiffening of regular troops and accordingly one sec tion of the 23rd Indian Mountain Battery, one Squadron of the 15fch Laneers and the Headquarters Wing of the 12ith Baluchistan Infantry were desDafW ed to Bandar Abbas from Bushire. Some ^tie time was spent in raising a few men for the South Persia Military Police, and then considerable difficulty was experienced in col lecting sufficient transport for the column. It, however, started for Kerman' in two echelons, on th^ 17th and 21st May, and reached Kerman after a ciuiet march on the 11th June. At Kerman General Sykes received an enthusiastio welcome. Energetic measures were taken to punish people who had helned the uermans, and to get the town into some sort of order. , fter a a t Kerman, General Sykes received orders to proceed o Shu-az, and left Kerman on the 26th July wa Yezd and Ispahan, leavin? Major Far ran m charge of the South Persia Rifles (this designatioA having been adopted instead of South Persia Military Police) at Kerman. Major D. L R.

It reached Ispahan on the 10th September and remained there some time, as at this moment Ispahan was threatened by the advance of the Turks from Hamadan, and it seemed p ssible that the co-operations of the column would be required. This, however OnfJ! tml 1 ne . C( : ssai 7 a nd General Sykes left Ispahan with the column on October .0th arnnng at^ Shiraz on the 12th November. On its arrival at Ispahan the column received a most enthusiastic welcome from the Russians and I ersians, and during its stay the officers and men were most hospitably treated. n n ar 1 r . ival tlle column at Shiraz, General Sykes took un thft question of the disposal of the remains of the Pars Gendarmerie and m Hip end decided to take over nearly all the officers and men available _fi the ° f December the Gendarmerie posts down to Kazemn well for deaUm* wfth the •■ PeiSia rI Ejl9es . an(i things seemed to be shaping i tor aealin 0 with the Bushire road question when the revolt of Nasir-i-Diwan Kazerun above-mentioned upset everything.

On the night of the 5th July a few shots were fired at the guard and one sepoy was wounded in the arm. The Darya Begi, who was down the Gulf at the time, visited the place, and as no trace of the offenders had been dis covered, nor any clue to the attack on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's camp in the previous year, His Excellency inflicted a fine of 3,000 tomans on the Island.

During the year the number of patients treated at the Hospital was Hos . tal 15,575. Of these 15,520 were out-patients 08pi a ' and 55 in-door cases. The operations performed were 639. The health of the Gulf Ports^ except in the case of Mohammerah, Abadaru Sanitary. and Pandar Abbas was good. Bandar Abbas suffered a good deal from small-pox, while plague and cholera occurred at the two former ports. In Mohammerah one case of plague was reported to have occurred on 10th April. Several cases were found by 10th May, and quarantine was imposed against Mohammerah from that date. Until the town was declared free, the total number of plague cases was 202. Cholera was first ported in Mohammerah on the 5th June, and by tli e 10th June, when quarantine was imposed, the disease had been found in the town, and among Indian employes of Strick Scott &amp; Co. occupied in barge building. The total number of cases, until the town was declared free on 28tli June, was 86. At Abadan, cholera occurred in the end of May. There were 50 cases and 24 deaths in all. These included cases occurring in two Sikh sweepers, deserters from Basrah, a Gurkha of the oil Guard, and some men from the Transport Knrmak ' and from H. M. S. ' Alert.' At Bushire a small and quickly limited outbreak of plague was discorered on the 5th April. The cases occurred among coolies who had been landed on the 1st April from S. S, ' Zayani.' There were 10 cases and 3 deaths. On discovery of the cases at Busliire, a wire was sent to the Port Health Officer, Bombay, requesting him to have the ship disinfected on her arrival in Bombay! This was accordingly performed. On her next trip up the Gulf the ship was again found to be infected, she was sent to Mohammerah for disinfection and deratisation. On the 18th of May a single case of plague of obscure origin occurred in the town of Bushire. The usual measures were taken and there was no spread. In the end of January, the Sanitary Council granted Quarantine powers to the Port Health Officer, Abadan. The Clayton barge, formerly stationed at Mohammerah, was transferred to Basrah during the year.

R. Howson held charge of the Lingah Vice-Consulate, in addition to holding charge of the Vice-Consulate at Bandar Abhas, from the beginning of the year to 8th August, when he was relieved by Mr. GL A. MunGavin, in the Lingah appointment. Mr. G. A MunGavin was still in charge at the end of the year. Erom the beginning of the year up to 7th August, Mr. Howson visited Lingah on seven occasions. Luring his absence, the current duties were carried on by the late Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, Residency Agent, up to the 6th of April, when his death occurred;, under tragic circumstances, which will be dealt with later on in this report. After the regrettable incident of the 6th April, Mr. J. G. Johnstone of the Indian Subordinate Medical Department, informally took charge of local duties during Mr. Howson's absence until 1st July, from which date, Agha Abdul Ghani, a nephew of the late Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, was appointed as temporary Residency Agent, Lingah. The appointment of temporary Residency ilgent was abolished from the 31st December 1916, owing to a British Representative having been appointed. Mirza Mahmood Khan who held office as Deputy Governor at the end of T , , last year, was dismissed on the 5th of Local Officials. * ' - I1 oijji June, and replaced by the featwat-ul- Mamalik, Muhammad Reza Khan, eldest son of the Soulet-ul-Mulk, Khan of Basiak. Muhammad Reza Khan remained in office at the close of the year. Mirza Mahmood Khan, though apparently fairly popular with the local inhabitants, was inclined to be very avaricious; as well as weak. At the time ©f the murder of the Khan Bahadur Agha Badr, and his two brothers, while admittedly his position was a difficult one, he nevertheless proved himself a very shaky reed. Muhammad Reza Khan, who is a Sunni, though exceedingly tactless on occasion, generally worked in a most friendly manner with the Vice-Consulate, He was rather inclined to interfere in matters which did not concern him, and was inclined to think that, as Deputy Governor, he should have been given a perfectly free hand in all matters. The Deputy Governor performed the duties of Karguzar. Muhammad Khwaja, who j) ose( i as Turkish Consul throughout 1915, ^ ^ continued to fly the lurkish flag till 4th Foreign Representatives. r. , i • n i • ^ February or this year, when his flag was removed and seals, archives, etc., were taken over by His Majesty's Represent atives. The proceedings were carried out in a peaceful manner, and no trouble occurred. On Muhammad Khwaja giving a written undertaking to refrain from intrigue, he was allowed to remain on in his house. Muhammad Tahnoon remained, nomirally. Agent to His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, in spite of the fact that His highness had promised to dismiss him. Monsieur Cattersell held charge as Director of Persian Customs throughout the year unrler review, and relations between the Vice-Consulate and the Cus toms Department have been of a most cordial nature during that time ; Monsieur Cattersell always being ready to settle matters in a friendly spirit. Asaf-ul-Mulk, who was Finance Agent in 1915, remained in office T , „ throusrhout the year.

The late Qawam-ul-Mulk, who Condition of country. ^ to beat a ljasty refcrea t f r om Shiraz b December 1915, was unable to enter Lar, and had to come to Lingah to consult the British Authorities, and reorganise his resources. After visiting Bushire, the Qawam returned up-country, via Lingah, with the object of punishing the Gendarmes and Democrats. He lelt Lingah, on the 17th of March, for Lar, where he very soon restored order by punishing some of the instigators of the trouble. The Muktadir-ul ■ Mamalik, Deputy Governor of Lar, was taken prisoner, and a new man, Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, appointed. There was no trouble in Bastak throughout the year. The Soulet-ul- Mulk, Khan of Bastak, and his followers Bastak. emained loyal to the Qawam-ul Mulk. On the whole, there was very little inter-tribal trouble along the Shib-Kuh coast during the year. A small affair took place between Shaikh Salih of Charak, and Shaikh Muhammad bin Rahman Bushri, of Tavuneh, but this was soon settled by the timely arrival of His Excellency the Darya Begi, and what might have been a serious affair, was nipped in the bud. The most regrettable incident of the year occurred in Lingah town, viz., Iit , crah the assassination of the Eesidency Agent, Khan Bahadur Agha Badr and his two brothers, Khan Sahib Agha Ali, and the Vice-Consulate Dragoman, Agha Ibrahim. On the 6th of April, about noon, without the slightest warning, some of the Deputy Governor's tufangchis shot the Kesidency Agent and his two brothers. Then they attacked the Vice-Consulate guard, comprised of one Naik and eight sepoys, killing two and wounding five, two severely. The guard, though completely taken by surprise, did remarkably well in beating off the attack, and at the same time killing one of the mutineers. The next to be attacked was a Deputy Governor, who was in the fort, and then the Quarantine Medical Officer's house, but no damage was done at the latter place. Rais Hussain, the leader of the mutineers, was shot during the attack on the Persian fort. W bile still under fire, news was received by Assistant Surgeon J. G. Johnstone, I. S. Al. D., the Quarantine Medical Officer, that the Residency Agent had been wounded and was dying, whereupon the former promptly left his place and made his way to the latter's house, but found that nothing could be done to save him. The whole town was by now in a perfect panic, and Assistant Surgeon J. G. Johnstone deserves great credit, for the manner in which betook com- plete command of the situation. The remnants of the sepoy guard were stationed in the late Khan Bahadur Agha Badr's house, with a few other servants, who had been armed, and other British subjects, who were not considered to be safe enough in their own houses, were collected in the Persian fort. q ^ ^ U ^ eers two were killed, ten arrested and disarmed by Assistant burgeon J G Johnstone, the remaining twelve made good their escape through the ports of the Shibkuh. 1 ° Two of the assassins were later sentenced to death, and were brought to fort^ 1 Lxcellency the Darya Begi and hanged in front of the Persian ti,, S iVe ^ aSUre f W f 0 t 1 a - k ? n b / His E ^&lt;=ellency the Darya Begi against nX t ? p n S ^ ■ • fugitives received assistance.

The Persian Customs Agent at Kohistak was murdered by Tahirzais and several raids were committed by Tahirzais and Bashakirdis. Retaliatory measures were taken by Kohandil Khan which were resented by Mir Barkat who threatened to invade Minab. Pressure was brought to bear by the Eesidency and the Governor of the Gult' Ports on Mir Barkat and he gave up his intention, but he continued to interfere in Minab affairs till Kohandil Khan was removed from Minab at our instance. Since then comparative quiet has prevailed. Notwithstanding robberies on the trade routes and high freights by land T and sea, the trade of Bandar Abbas for the year under report was a record one for several years, owing no doubt to the Northern avenues of trade being partially or totally closed. The British India Steam Navigation Company's Subsidiary mail steamers ceased to run in April, but trade continued to find its way to Bandar Abbas by other lines, such as the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company and a line of six Japanese steamers chartered by a Persian named Mirza Muhammad Shirazi in Bombay. The greatest drawback to trade has been the exceptionally heavy demand by the Military authorities for transport animals to convey troops and stores to Kerman. Merchandise was delayed and the merchants, not having sufficient store room accommodation, had no alternative but to leave their goods in the Customs House and to pay the heavy ground rent charges. ^ The result was that, on more than one occasion, great congestion occurred in the Customs House. The employment of a Government Camel Corps to convey Military stores to the interior is a necessity, if trade is not to be unduly hampered. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company's staff returned to Qishm Island on January 1916 and recommenced boring British interests. which continued without cessation till the end of the year. The Camp was moved from Salakh to Has Tarkun where a condenser had been installed and later a house was erected. After the murder of the Residency Agent at Lingah, in April, it was thought advisable to replace the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Tangistani guard by a detachment of Native Infantry. This was effected without any untoward incident, in June. Assistant Surgeon H. C. Berlie, I. S. M. D., held the post of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. The Quarantine. Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company's steamer ' Zayani 55 arrived in harbour on the 26th April with one case of plague on board. The patient died on board and was buried at sea. The ship, after some slight detention, was allowed to proceed to Bushire, the authorities at that port having been warned. Mr. Howson visited Lingah seven times, the last occasion being in August when he handed over charge of the Lingah Tours ■ Vice-Consulate to Mr. MunGavin. He also visited Qishm, Henjam and Ras Tarkun during the year. The construction of the Telegraph Line via Daulatabad and Baft to Kerman was begun on the 1st of October Bandar Abbas Kerman Telegraph Lme. ^ ^ p insent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and the first section—Bandar Abbas to Niyam 43*07 miles—was completed on the 6th November. Purther progress was delayed in the first instance owing to delay in distributing material and later because of an unfavourable report by Major Rich on the Daulatabad-Baft route for the construction of a motor road. Orders were, however, received by Mr. Blackman to continue the construction and work recommenced on the 16th December and continued without interruption till the end of the year. Major Rich, R.E., was deputed to survey for a motor road to Kerman. He arrived on the 15th November and Bandar Abbas-Eerman Road Survey. surveys Were begun of all the principal routes.18 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTEATION REPORT Twenty-six slaves took refuge at the Vice-Consulate during the year, Thirteen of them were manumitted and Slaves ' the remainder were either returned to their masters or absconded while their cases were under consideration. Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes arrived on the 16th March to raise and organize a force of Military Police (after- south Persia Rifles. wards called South Persia Eifles) to take AD the place of the gendarmerie in Southern Persia. He was accorded an enthu siastic welcome by all classes. Recruiting was brisk for the first month or two. Three hundred men enlisted, but as they were found to be very poor specimens it was decided to raise the standard of medical examination and to go further afield for recruits. At first the results were disappointing and few recruits were forthcoming; wliid but towards the end of the year, with the assistance of the Residency at Bushire, i 11 ? ^ a fair number of Tangistani recruits were obtained.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE KERMAN CONSULATE FOR THE YEAR 1916. The post of Consul was vacant until the arrival of Major D. L. R. Lorimer, Hia Majesty's Consulate. 011 JuI y 24ih ' when he Proceeded to take over the Consular and political work which had been initiated and carried on by General Sykes and his staff dur ing the preceding six weeks. In September it was decided to revive and maintain, till at least six months after the conclusion of the war, the appointment of Vice-Consul and Assistant, and Mr. C. P. Skrine, I.C.S., then Assistant Political Officer, Sibi, was nominated to the post. He arrived in Kerman on 10th November. As it was not intended to continue to employ Mirza Nasrullah Khan, Clerical Estabiisbment. Honorary Vice-Consul, in the Consulate, sanction was obtained for the appoint ment of an Indian Head Clerk on a relatively high rate of pay and of an Indian Accountant on a lower rate. Khan Sahib Abdul Alim was appointed to the former post and accompanied Major Lorimer on the journey up to Kerman. It was arranged that Mirza Nasrullah Khan should be taken into the service of General Sykes, or the South Persia Hifles, and that on the departure of the Column for Yezd he should remain temporarily in Kerman. .By General Sykes' courtesy His Majesty's Consul was granted a share of hia services, and, as no other Mirza could be procured in Kerman at the time, this arrangement was a very fortunate one. Mirza Nasrullah Khan eventually left for Yezd and Shiraz in the begin ning of November and a temporary Mirza with no knowledge of English was wdth some difficulty engaged. The arrangement is for many reasons unsatis factory, but it has been impossible as yet to improve on it. The question of clerks' salaries has been rendered very difficult by the fall in the exchange value of the kran aggravated by a rise in the kran prices of all necessaries. The rupee, which in 1913-15 averaged about 3*65 krans, stood, in august 1916, at 2*60 and continued to fall till, at the end of the year, it reached I'TO kracs. The increase in kran prices of local and imported necessaries of life varied from 20 to 100 per cent. Living, at any rate in recent years, was never particularly cheap, and it is now some two to four times more expensive than it was in 1914, reckoning in rupees. Repeated references were made on the subject, and it is understood to be now under the consideration of the Government of India, but no relief has yet l)een afforded. In the meantime the Accountant has found it necessary to resign. The contract between the treatment of members of the South Persia Eifies and of other services is very marked. The South Persia Rifles have all the privileges of Field Service and are allowed to convert their Rupee salaries at a fixed rate of 3*65 krans to the rupee. The Indian Jlscort. —On his appointment His Majesty's Consul proposed that, instead of an Indian Escort, he should be furnished with a Persian one by the South Persia Rifles, or should be allowed to raise a local one. The South Persia Rifles were not however yet in a position to furnish one, and eventually it was decided to attach to the Consulate a detachment of 1 Native Officer and 25 Non-Commissioned Officers and men of the 39th Central India Horse who had accompanied General Sykes to Kerman. Political IListory. —After the departure of the British and Russian .... communities from Kerman, on 17th vennan sans es ng am. December 1915, which has been related in last year's report, the control of affairs both in the town and province d 220 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT passed entirely into the hands of the Germans and Democrats. As the former were busy maturing their plans lor an advance into Baluchistan and Afghan istan, they appear to have left the Democrats an almost free hand to mismanage local affairs. i 1 he Sardar Zafar nominally retained his position as Governor-General, but was alternately cajoled and bullied by the Democrats, and he made no effort to assert his authority, as he could probably easily have done. The affairs of the province, and especially as lying nearer to hand, of the town, were controlled by a junta the principal and most active members of which were the Karguzar, Muham-ul-Mulk, the Rais-i-Muarif, Saijid Mustafa Khan, Sultan. Muhammad .Khan, Commanding the Gendarmerie, and the Rais-i-Tahdid (Superintendent of the Opium Department) Mirza Husain Khan. The Nazim-ut-Tujjar might almost be allowed a place in this galaxy, but for some reason he was a little unpopular in the most select Democrat circles. The names of the Shari'at-Madar, Agha Mehdi, Eais-i-Baladiyah, and the Amin-ul-Islam also deserve to be inscribed in the roll of Persian Patriots. The following are a few of the principal events that occurred during the six months between the departure of the British in December and their return in the following June. The sources are Persian narratives, and Persians are poor chronologists, so the sequence of events is in many cases somewhat uncertain. Certain Democrats were promptly deputed to go to the office of the Imperial Bank of Persia and bring away the cash. There was some 40,000 tomans of which half was given to the Sardar Zafar. The Germans sent one Ali Asghar, Naqqash, a former employ^ of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Limited, to raise a force of sowars in Shiraz, and they were reinforced by the arrival of the German Seiler with some Austrians. The carpets of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Limited, were then seized by Zugmeyer and handed over to Bruggmann, who despatched a large quantity to Yezd. The Democrats soon began to wish to reap the fruits of victory, and they were also doubtless in need of funds in order to keep their followers together. They therefore arranged with the Sardar Zafar to appoint four Committees to give effect to their desires. No. 1 was a Committee of Adjustment for the management of domestic affairs and included some respectable and non-Democrat members, such as the Sardar Nusrat and the Mukhtar-ul-Mulk. No. 2 was a Commission to raise Aanah or war tax. No. 3 was for the enlistment of local forces and the acquisition of arms and ammunition. No. 4 appears to have been a financial Commission, which framed a budget for the He venue Department that was naturally never given effect The Germans received further reinforcements from Shiraz, and Zugmeyer then despatched a party to Khabis which was intended to proceed across the Lut to Sistan. It started off, fell in with robbers, was roughly handled and forced to retire again on Khabis. Keinforced bv Seiler it start fid nnf no-nin hnt assisted bystratagems in which the Sardar Zafar pla^d IZ as a good deal of half open half concealed opposition fomented by the Sardar Nusrat and the Mulla Jamal-ud-Din.

It appears that he also received advice from relations in Ispahan to abandon the British and Russians and ally himself with the Germans, for whom large reinforcements were said to be coming from Yezd and Shiraz. In the latter part of January Zugmeyer and a familiar and choice spirit, the Itizad -ul-Hazarat, left for Bam, whence they proceeded on a tour into Baluchistan the results of which however appear to have been nugatory. Seiler remained in charge in Kerman, and Bruggmann, the Swiss Agent of the Pesische Teppich Gesellschaft, (German) Persian Garnet Company, was appoint ed German Imperial Vice-Consal, though the appointment was never confirmed from Tehrau. Humours of Russian successes in the Kermanshah region now began to gain ground and the Democrat cause to decline somewhat in popularity. The Democrats accordingly set themselves to try and beat up recruits and started a scheme for raising a force of 'Mujahidin' (Volunteers). A body of riff raff was drilled in the town with the assistance for a time of a German, Paschen (?), and agents were despatched into the districts to bring in recruits ; but these efforts do 'not appear to have met with much success, and the Germans had little better luck in Shiraz and Sirjan. More precise reports of the advance of the Russians towards Ispahan and rumours of a British force having arrived at Bandar Abbas were now received and the Democrats became more and more uneasy. A distraction however was provided by the arrival of the Turkish ' Ambassador Muhammad Obeidullah, who was received and feted with much enthusiasm. He spoke re peatedly in public places, and his text was of course the ' Unity of Islam ' in which these degenerate sons of Shias, the Kermanis, saw no irony. It is clear that this man obtained, and still holds, the respect of the general public, and not merely of the Democrat faction. About this time, with tbe connivance of the Sardar Zafar, the charge of His Majesty's Consulate was transferred from a mixed guard of Sarbaz (under the control of the Sardar Nusrat) and Gendarmes, to one composed solely of Gendarmes. This enabled the Karguzar, Muham-ul-Mulk, to indulge his curiosity as to the nature of the Consulate records. He must have been dis- appointed as the work of destruction before the Consulate was evacuated appears to have been more than thorough. Por two months the Consulate remained in the charge of Sultan Muhammad ILhan of the Gendarmerie. The Sardar Nusrat had all along been an object of dislike to the Democrats. He had not joined them in any of their enterprises and he had constantly urged the Governor-General to assert himself and put a check on their power. At one time the Democrats endeavoured to have the Sardar sent out with a force to oppose a rumoured advance of the Russians from the direction of Meshed but in this they failed. They now decided on more drastic measures for getting rid of him. Por some time they appear to have attempted to ambush him by parties of cut throats but without success, and they were obliged at length to have recourse to more elaborate methods. The scheme was worked out one night by the Rais-i-Muaris, Saiyid Mustafa, some Austrians, and the Rais-i-Tahdid, Mirza Hussain Khan, in the house occupied by the latter. This house appears to have been situated on the road between the Sardar's house in the Bagh-i-Nishat and the town. The following morning (March Mth, 1916) all passers-by were haled into the enclosure so that no rumour of the mischief brewing might reach the Sardar Bombs were laid in the road and the wall was loopholed and manned. Operations were controlled by the Rais-i-Muarif from the roof of the house. In due course the Sardar came along and entered the lane, but he was accompanied by sowars. The leading sowars exploded the bombs and were blown up. The Sardar was behind ; but his horse was hit and he himself was wounded in the leg. The explosion however had filled the air with dust, under thecover of which his followers were able to carry him back to the Bagh-i- Nishat. On learning of his escape the Democrats sallied out in pursuit, but on nearin 01 the Bagh they were fired on, and later a body of Bakhtiaris' sent out by the Governor -General and some Buchaqchis appearing on the scene, the Democrats had to beat a retreat.22 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT After this miscarriage the Germans, Democrats and the Sarclar Zafar all pressed the Sardar Nusrat to leave the town and he withdrew to Rafsinjan. The Bakhtiaris now became more and more discontented with the ascen dancy of the Democrats and bepran to put pressure on their unheroic Chief the Sardar Zafar. The only result appears to have been that he withdrew from the Government House and took up his quarters outside the town in the house of the Adl-us-Sultan, and that the Democrats seized the Artillery Barracks and appointed two of their number, Abul Qasim Shimr and Ali Kaku, to the command or the troops vice the Sardar Nusrat. At this juncture however news was received of the defeat of the Mujahidm in various parts of Persia and the arrival of General Sykes's Mission at Bandar Abbas became generally known and the Democrats began to lose heart and think of flight and safety. Seller also decided to move toSirjan and Zugmeyer announced his intention of re- iurning from Bam. The Sardar Zafar advised him to proceed direct to join Seiler at Sirjan. This he did, but apparently on the instigation of th« Sardar Zafar his paity was attacked by the Bakhtiaris at Baft, with the result that Itizud-ul-Hazarat and others were killed, the party was looted and Zuo-meyer was fortunate enough to make his escape towards Sirjan. Meanwhile relations between the Bakhtiaris and Democrats in the town had reached a crisis, hostilities broke out and the Bakhtiaris captured the Sarbazkanah and arrested a number of the Democrats whom they threatened to kill, Ihe Sardar Zafar, however, inteiyened and, persuaded by his son, Ali Muhammad Khan and others, he ordered their release. The Bakhtiaris had of course, availed themselves of the opportunity afforded for pillage, and/ though restitution was afterwards promised by the Sardar Zafar, articles of no value were returned to their owners. Seiler now procured a safe conduct from the Sardar Zafar for himself and his men and proceeded to Sirjan with a Bakhtiari escort under the S ahab-un-Isizam. All the Democrat prisoners were released and the Nazim-ut-Tujjjar and M.

Zugmeyer appears to have behaved with some decency and moderation but Seller has left behind him a reparation for violence which may well have been deserved, if the story that he shot with his own hand an Austrian sub ordinate who brought in dinner late is true. Murder, robbery and violence were however the special prerogatives of t ^ e . :D f m0Crats .' an ^ mai ?y brother Persians claim to have been the victims of their despoliation and vindictiveness. In the sacred name of the cause money weapons and property were confiscated or destroyed. The title ' Democrats given them by themselves has unfortunately been universally accepted, but it is a misnomer. They are in fact anarchists who have no scheme of Government which they want to introduce, but only desire to remove the slight remaining safeguaids of life and property which the existing Government provides and practice, without troubling to preach the doctrine, that ' might is right'. The Kermanis desciibe each other as ' sheep' and the mass of them certainly have no will of their own and have just enough natural vice to be always ready in large numbers to follow any evil shepherd. There could be no more promising field of operations for a handful of active unscrupulous ' Democrats '. A few days after the affair of Saadatabad a telegram was received from Tehran announcing the dismissal of the Sardar Zafar. He hesitated, but eventually decided to obey, and, in accordance with a further telegram from Tehran, Sardar Nusrat took over the Governorship and he himself left for Bafsinjan. Mirza Asadullah Khan, Kurdistani, who had arrived, in spite of Democrat opposition, early in the disturbances, was now installed as Financial Agent in place of the Democrat tool, Mirza Ismail Khan, but his day was short for his appointment was soon cancelled from Tehran and the Banan-ud-Daulah despatched to take his place. The Banan arrived about the middle of July. A similar fate also overtook the Sardar Nusrat, who had to give way to the Nusrat-us-Sultaneh, the youthful uncle of the Shah, who himself had had to surrender the greater glories of Ears and Shiraz to the Earman Farma. Appeals were made by the people both to Tehran and General Sykes that the Sardar Nusrat should be maintained as Governor-General, but they only resulted in his being appointed Assistant Governor. The Nusrat-us Sultaneh arrived and was duly installed in the middle of June, a few days after General Sykes, who entered the city on the 12th of that month. General Sykes' arrival had been looked forward to with some apprehension by the townspeople, who not unnaturally feared that they might become the victims, deserving or undeserving, of punitive measures. They were however soon reassured by the mildness of his methods and the care that was taken to distinguish the innocent from the guilty. The above summary of events in which no British subjects took part has been prepared from Persian narratives, in dealing with which every endeavour has been made to eliminate what might have been inspired by private interest or prejudice. In what follows the ordinary sources of official reports have been available. In the first place we may briefly trace the steps by which the right to exist in this quarter of Persia was restored to the British, and the measures which have been, and are being taken to maintain order in Southern Persia and to insure that British influence shall be predominant in the ' British Sphere of Influence General Sykes' force consisting of :— 1 Section, 23rd Mountain Battery. 1 Squadron, ]5th Lancers. 1 Troop Central India Horse. 12-iith Baluchistan Infantry less 4! Companies,2i PEBSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION HEPOET concentrated at Bandar Abbas in April and he bimself marched ^ith his staS and the Cavalry and Artillery for Kerman, on the 17th of May. J he Infantry followed some five days later. The march was accomplished without adven- ture and General Sykes was received by his old friend, the Sardar INusrat, and the population with open arms. The official reception concluded with all due formalities, work was begun. The main tasks that fell to b e undertaken were the raising of the South Persia Eifles, then known as the South Persia Military Police, and the inyestigation of the recent conduct of the inhabitants so far as it had affected British interests or might in the future affect the security of the Biitish and the peace of the province. The enlistment and organisation of the Police force was at once taken in hand by Major Farran, Captain Powle and Captain Merrill who had been appointed to Kerman for the purpose. British claims were received and were investigated at the Karguzari in the presence of Captain Thorburn, and referred to General Sykes for final orders. In some 16 cases ^ sentences of fine, imprisonment, or expulsion from the town were passed and the majority of these were carried into effect without difficulty. A few of the more important cases in which execution was delayed will be referred to later on. The offences were either having taken some active part in the disturbances on the Democrat and German side or having illegally acquired the property of British subjects. General Sykes was further occupied by work entailed by the command of the Column which it was intended should proceed under his command to Shiraz with a ^iew to restoring order in that quarter, and to organising a British police force on the Bushire-Ispahan road. In this work General Sykes was assisted by his Staff Officer, Major Eraser Hunter. When the force arrived at Kerman a number of Austrians, Afghans and others, members of Seller's party, who had been attacked, robbed and in some eases wounded at Saadatabad were under the surveillance of the Persian authorities at Saidabad, the capital of Sirjan. Bruggmann, a Swiss subject and Agent of the German Persian Carpet Company, who had been an active ally of the Germans and had been appointed by them ' Vice-Consul ' at Kerman, was recovering from enteric fever in Kerman. He was arrested and, after an investigation, General Sykes decided to send him and one or two others who had also been caught in Kerman(?), to join those in Sirjan, whence the whole party was to be sent down to Bandar Abbas for deportation to India. Arrangements were made for an escort to be supplied by the Local Government and a certain Shahzada Husain of Kerman town, who had a personal following of 20 armed men, was appointed to take charge of the prisoners and escort and commissioned to convey them to Bandar Abbas. The force and prisoners were duly assem bled under his command, in Saidabad, but their departure was in the first instance delayed by the fact that some of the wounded prisoners were not yet in a fit state to travel. Matters were in this position when Major D. L. R. Lorimer, who had been appointed His Majesty's Consul, and arrived on the 2ith July in Kerman, took over charge of the Consular and Political work from General Sykes. The column started for Yezd en-route to Shiraz on the 26th, and were followed by General Sykes on the 28th July. The force reached Yezd safely on 14th August. The situation in Kerman was highly favourable to the British. The real governing power had remained in the hands of the Sardar Nusrat, of whose loyalty to the British, as lonp as they are obviously dominant, there can be no question. He had been, as we have seen above, an object of saspicion to the Germans and to the late Governor-General, the Sardar Zafar, and of animosity to the Democrats. He had certainly no reason to love the latter, but takings loug view and contemplating the possibility of being thrown a^ain at some future time on his own resources, he seems to have shown a very unvindictivc spirit and to have counselled a policy of oblivion or of mild moderation in the case of the more influer tial of the local leaders by whom he might at some future date be oalled to account. There is no doubt that the driving energy had come from the Germans, and the non-Kerman Democrat leaders who had disappeared en masse, some to Shiraz and others to Tehran,'0 \ ■ ^ / FOR THE TEAR 1916. 26 The New Governor-General, Shahzada Nusrat-us-Saltanah, uncle of the present Shah, a frail youth with pleasant manners, was quite alive to the necessity of keeping on friendly terms with the British. He was however very young and without experience, and his chief counsellor, the Ihtisham-ud-Daula, said to he an ex-Sous Secretaire in the Persian Foreign Office and of obscure origin, was unfortunately a man to whom no ruse, trickery or method of plausible intrigue practised in Tehran political circles was likely to be unknown. General Sykes decided to maintain in fact the paramount authority of the Sardar JS T us rat, his own nominee. This policy was convenient, but the'resulting situation could not be expected to be grateful to the Piince and his party who perfectly appreciated it, and it had, and while it lasts will have, every element of instability in it. Equilibrium can only be produced from outside by throw ing part of the weight of British influence into the Sardar Nusrat's scale to counteract the Prince's advantage of title, royalty and influence in Tehran. This balancing of interests and forces rrakes a peaceful life impossible, but is not without advantages as it puts a real power of control in the hands of the British It cannot, however, endure indefinitely Soon after General Sykes' departure orders came from the Persian Government directing that the Sardar Nusrat be removed from office and sent to Tehran, and it was found that, while the Prince and his party had been assuring 1 General Sykes of their whole-hearted acceptance of his wishes, they had all the time been pushing their intrigues in Tehran for the removal of the Sardar Nusrat. His Majesty's Consul prevented the publication of these orders, and when later the Prince openly asked for permission to start a campaign against the Sardar, His Majesty's Consul succeeded in extracting a promise from him to discon tinue his intrigues and not to recommence them until the dangers produced by the Russian loss of Hamadan had been weathered and, in any case, not to do so without consulting His Majesty's Consul. This promise the Prince would appear to have observed with tolerable, if not complete, faithfulness. The third official of importance as an official was the Karguzar. With the manners, appearance and abilities of the Mad Hatter the Kamal-us-Sultan combined a servility which would make him remarkable even among a people who are still addicted to the worship of the rising, or risen, sun. He protests that his only ambition is to meet British v\ ishes, and he seldom ventures on offering a suggestion until he has assured himself that it will be an acceptable one. On the other hand, he does not raise difficulties and he does try to carry out the instructions which he invites. The brains of the establishment are lodged in his assistant Mirza Habibullah Khan, who in the last 20 years has frequently acted as Karguzar for long periods. In His Majesty's Consul's previous experience Habibullah was always friendly to His Majesty's Consulate. His foible was discreet peculation which was sometimes a source of inconvenience to himself and the Consulate in commercial work. The work of tracing and running to earth British stolen property and of investigating the conduct of persons of Democratic and anti-British proclivities fell chiefly to the Karguzar aided by the Head of the Police, Sardar Khan, a Kermani and adherent of the Sardar Kusrat's, and it is partly thanks to their efforts that so much was accomplished. On August 12th came the first news of the Russian reverses in the West of Persia and it served to raise the hopes and stimulate the activities of the Democrats. General Sykes with his force was halted at Yezd and the question of its diversion to Ispahan came into debate, and the ' Kerman Column ' had not yet arrived at Bandar Abbas. In the meantime large bands of Pars robbers had become extremely active on the Kerman-Yezd road, and warnings began to arrive from Sirjan that the 'German' prisoners were enjoying an undue amount of freedom and were undesirably intimate with the people. Repeated orders to Shahzada Hussain to start them off for Bandar Abbas were met by excuses of insecurity on the road and insufficient escort. Arrange ments were made from Kerman to raise the escort to C8 men, funds were supplied, and orders were sent to start whatever the state of the road, but the latter were traversed by instructions from Yezd to locate the robbers and start when the road was clear. Considerable uneasiness was felt in Kerman and His Majesty's Consul consulted, on 19th August, with Major Farran and the26 PEESIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION EEPOET Sardar Nusrat. As the result of this conference it was decided to send out Captain Merrill at once to Saidabad to take over command of the prisoner? and see that they set out at once for the coast. He was provided with an escort by the Sardar Nusrat, but otherwise had only some half dozen men of the old Gendarmerie with him. He rode through by double stages to Saidabad where he arrived on the evening of the 22nd August and was welcomed by the Adl-us-Sultan, Sardar Nusrat's brother, and other local officials The same night a party of Hussain Khan Buchaqchi's men, obviously in pursuance of a prearranged plan, entered the prisoners' quarters, liberated them and carried them off. No resistance was made by the various guards, and Shahzada Hussain accompanied his charges. There are considerable grounds for suspecting the Adl-us-Sultan of complicity. He professes to have known that some such scheme was in the air, but he did not warn Captain Merrill and he failed to inform him of the prisoners' escape until they had been gone for some time. Every difficulty was then raised to attempting an immediate pur suit. The Adl is a clever man and has, of course, got a plausible answer to all charges. Captain Merrill is further convinced that the Sardar Nusrat fore stalled his arrival, which was intended to be a surprise, by a special messenger who got off a few^ hours before Captain Merrill on the road, was overtaken by him but again disappeared. Other suspects are the Revenue Agent, Mirza Salih Khan and Agha Murad Khan, the ' friendly ' chief of the Euchaqchis and cousin and habitual ' enemy' of Hussain Khan. The disloyalty of a large section of the Saidabad population was proved by later events beyond dispute. The prisoners were taken to Qala Sang and thence to Balward, about 25 miles east of Saidabad, and Merrill was left in rather an awkward predicament in the town, surrounded by professed friends of whose bad faith he was con vinced and whom he more than suspected of designing to murder him or take him prisoner and bring back the escaped prisoners in triumph. ^ Jbiom Kerman he was separated by 100 miles partly of mountain track, which was later watched by Hussain Khan's men, and letters, when not robbed, took at least five days to pass by a detour vice Pariz. «• His first letter bringing news of these events reached Kerman on 27th August and steps were at once taken by Major Farran to S +. i * 0 /r^ a ^ 1 men any degree trained and reliable whom he had at his disposal. These were practically limited to a small body of the old enc armene. His Majesty's Consul took steps to publish offers of rewards for e c.e nery up of the prisoneis and their rescuers. Major Parran suggested to eiii.ra y 'es that his column should remain in Yezd till the situation cleared, but it had already been decided that this column should go on to Ispahan and m pursuance of this it marched out of Yezd on the 18th August.

Meanwhile Captain mil 'Wagstaff with his 95 rifles had reached Eaft on 4th September and, though ^ much disappointed at finding that Eraser's party had gone on to Kerman, N he did not hesitate to direct his march straight on Saidabad. On the way he learned that Hussain Khan and the ey-prisoners were on the move from the ^ Chahargumaz Mountains to the Kuh-i-Khajui (' Khavich' on the maps) and would cross his line of march. No genuine assistance, however, could be obtained from the Afshar or local inhabitants either in the way of infor- J. 511 mation or armed forces, as their object appears to have been to acquire merit l ' b y pretended services and misleading information which would at the same ^ time ensure Hussain Khan an unimpeded line of flight. They succeeded in ■ the latter aim, and the fugitive party got through. Captain Wagstaff followed iefi | hard on their heels on the 10th and was eventually seconded by Lieutentant Eraser who left Saidabad at 1 a.m . on the 11th with his 30 sowars and some ^ Sirjan levies, but his own Infantry could not hope to overtake mounted men and U-t Lieutenant Eraser was too late. The pursuit was maintained as far as Zavaru by Lieutenant Eraser and up to Aval Chahquli by Captain Wagstaff, places er fc which lie to the south-west and south-east respectively of the Kuh-i-Khajui. eot, 1 y On the 13th September the forces concentrated, and took up their quar- )Ta i r ters, in Saidabad. Active reconnaissance work was kept up but nothing of importance occurred until the 27th September. Rumours were heard that Hussain Khan was collecting men in Ears territory and intended to make an attack on the British Eorce in Sirjan, but on the evening of the 27th it was &gt;5 reported that he was far off at Qala Ghaibi. The detail of what happened as K;:;: learned from different suurces are rather confused. The Adl-us-Sultan makes out that he warned the British officers of the probability of Hussain Khan's attacking iw that night and that it was arranged that he was to withdraw his men from cer tain burjs which were to be occupied by Indian troops, that it was their failure aini; to occupy these forts that enabled Hussain Khan with his men to slip into qIi the town at night. Captain Wagstaff, however, says that the Adl had given him definite information that Hussain Khan was far off, and he is certain j that the Adl knew of, and was privy to, Hussain Khan's attempt. In any case, early next morning, Hussain Khan was in. possession of certain burjs 'J; and houses in the town from which he opened fire on the Indian troops. ! Eighting went on all day and it was estimated that the enemy, who consisted J largely of townspeople, numbered the best part of 300. They were all behind S8! ' walls, while the Indians were more or less in the open, and it was only owing ? e : [t to the bad shooting of the Persians that our casualties amounted to only about half a dozen Indians. It had been taken for granted that the Indian troops could not and would not fight and when evening came and it had been proved that quite the reverse was the case Hussain Khan, realising that his coup had failed, broke out of the town with a party of 20 or 30 sowars. He was heavily fired on but without effect. Some, however, say that Hussian Khan himself stayed in the town over the night. The Austrian Lorenz was almost cer tainly present during the attack, and according to some Bruggmann was also there. It is said that communication went on between Agha Murad Khan the ' loyal ''Buchaqchi, the Adl-us-Sultan and Hussain Khan. No effective assistance was received from Agha Murad's men nor from the local levies who had been raided by Captain Merrill to the number of 300 or 400. Eew of the latter were even seen during the day, but it does not appear that they actually joined the enemy. This small action may be regarded in the light of a British victory. It convinced the local inhabitants that Indians led by British officers would fight as no rabble of their own much-vaunted tribal warriors would, and that their own marksmanship was unequal to picking off British officers even at short ranges : and it must have convinced the ex- prisoners and Hussain Khan that even with the advantage of cover and an assisting population the possession of Saidabad was not to be won even by a coup de main from a handful of Indian troops, with one small obsolete M. L. Mountain gun, operating more or less in the open. After the fight the policy of active reconnaissances in force was continued by Captain Wagstaff, but the enemy was careful to keep well out of danger's r 2 a)28 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT. way in the Chahargumbaz mountains. It was impossible to t-ike them by surprise, as they were kept well informed of our movements by friends i n the town, probably including Agha Murad. On one expedition an Austria^ by name ' Chope,' who had got separated from his pompanions, was found and recaptured at Balward. Hussain Khan and his guests remained in the Chahargumbaz country until driven out alter a few 'weeks by tliG cold, when they moved across to Kuhistan. Later Bruggmann and some others appear to have gone to Darab. In the attack it was stated that Hussain Khan was accompanied by a contingent of Khistanis, men of Shaikh Abul Hassan's. That the ex-prisoners are on some sort of terms both with the Khistanis and Baharlu is evident, but it is not clear that they have received any armed assistance from them, and it is said that ^ Shahzada Hussain was later robbed and reduced to destitution in Kuhistan, but this is uncertain. One thing which has been abundantly proved however is that the sympathies of the tribes, whether active or passive, are substantially with the Germans and Turks. Our Buchaqchi ' Allies ' have played a Tery ambiguous part, and it has not been a helpful one. The active elements in the town have been no better, and the Afshars, while professing good will, entirely failed to make any move towards capturing the prisoners which they could probably have easily done. Offers of rewards have proved absolutely useless His Majesty's Consul at once offered 500 tomans apiece for Hussain Khan, Ali Khan, Shahzada Hussain and the Turk, any Europaan, and the offer for the Turk was later raised to 2,000 tomans A soecial offer was also made by His Majesty's Consul to Gunj Ali Khan, Afshar, of a lump sum of 5,000 tomans for the delivery of the principal personages, with an immediate cash advance of 500 tomans for mobilisation expenses, if he Avould undertake the job. He did not however go the length of even applying for the 500 tomans. Why local feeling should be so strongly on the enemy side is not easy to determine with certainty. There is little doubt however that, in August, the populace of Sirjan believed that the Turkish advance was progressing unchecked. It was current that they were already in Yezd. The llussians are undoubtedly an object of tear and consequently of hate throughout Persia and we have associated ourselves with them. The Democrat type of Persian appears to picture a Persia emptied of Russians and British offering a happy hunting ground for his own depredations. He does not reckon w r ith the Germans and Turks as a permanent factor, and so far as he has seen them their policy admirably suits his owm most vicious ambitions. After the hope of satis fying his own immediate self-interest by looting, stealing and thieving ad lib, the Persian is undoubtedly influenced by the idea of the solidarity of Islam, and when in this frame of mind he does not think of the Turk as a Suni Heretic, nor as the historical enemy of Persia and transgressor of its frontiers, but only as a brother Muslim, Even h^re and in the presence of His Majesty's Consul the ' Ambassador ' Obeilullah is always spoken of with a latent feeling of respect. To judge from his letters he is an accomplished Persian scholar, and he evidently knows how to appeal to such slight vein of religious fanaticism as there is in the Persian and to the much deeper and more general hostility to the European that lies at the bottom of every Persian's heart. Turk and German are a strong combination, each making good the defects of the other. The part played by the people of the town was beyond all doubt, though it was impossible to prove guilt against individuals, and it was necessary to take notice of it. Phis Captain Wagstaff decided to do by imposing a general fine on a t ic inhabitants of 15,000 tomans. The apportioning and collecting of this line wasJe.t to the local^ Persian authorities. 5,000 tomans was eventually remitted, but the remaining 10,000 tomans was duly collected. His Majesty 's Consul at once notified his approval of the measure to His Majesty's Minister, an i is a niost curious fact that up to row, nearly five months alter the imposition ot the fine, no attempt appears to have been made by the Persian i ^ ^ Tf stion ! ^ interfere. Various individual protests have D ip nT^ Uei f* eC ^ is Majesty s Consul, and in a few cases a readjustment of ^onW^l f 111110 ^ aS be ! n but in fine has been appropriate sequel to the episode; and ect has been wholly excellent. A protest was lodged with His Majesty 's. , A 'V/ FOR THE YEAR 1916. 29 41 fir- Consul at Bandar Abbas on behalf of a number of Laris, through one Eaji 3ii|j Mehdi Lari, who, His Majesty's Consul at Bandar Abbas says, has rendered \ considerable service to the British. The connection of these Laris, of whom 60 4 arrived armed in Saidabad the day belore the attack, withHussain Khan's coup, jf is however one of the least doubtful facts in the whole aif&amp;ir. They probably soi only offer another instance of the Persian fixed policy of securing oneself uy against all contingencies by playing on both sides at the same time. H After the failure of Hussain Khan's coup no further trouble of a serious nature was experienced by the troops in Sirjan up to the end of the year. The presence of the Adl-us-Sultan and Agha Murad Khan was however felt to be inconvenient. They both professed devotion and made much of small apparent services, but the services seem often to have consisted in overcoming difficulties created by themselves, and it is believed that they were both in frequent friendly communication with the enemy. His Majesty's Consul consequently had them both summoned to Kerman by the Governor-General and Sardar Nusrat. Delay in conforming with the summons ensued, but the Adl eventually came in and Agha Murad was later brought in by Major Farran, who made a tour, in November, through Baft and Sirjan. Both have since remained, apparently contentedly, in the town. Besides the suspicion, amounting to 'certainty, that the Adl knew more about the escape and movements of the prisoners than he should have done, he is also to be blamed for having failed in his mission to recover the money and property robbed from the Germans There is reason to believe that the failure was more apparent than real and that the Adl returned to Kerman a richer man than he left it. Agha Murad Khan is also believed to have rewarded himself liberally for his services. On his return the Adl lost no time in pressing his merits and services on the notice of His Majesty's Consul, but he met with a rather chilly reception. His Majesty's Consul further counselled the Sardar .Nusrat to arrange for his brother to leave Kerman for a year or two. The advice was not taken, but it is now always open to His Majesty's Consul to sanction the enquiries into the conduct of the Adl in regard to these two matters, which the Prince, for purposes of his own, has repeatedly urged on him. The matter has been under consideration for some time (3rd March 1917) and the hunting of the Adl presents attractions, but also countervailing difficulties. On the arrival of General Sykes few traces of the Germans remained in the town of Kerman. The principal were Germans and Democrats. Bruggmann and one or two servants and a miscellaneous collection of correspondence and seditious literature designed for use m India. The correspondence includes reports on the progress of German affairs in Kerman, and copies of handsomely got up printed letters addressed to the Amir, the Maharaja of Nepal and the leading Ruling Chiefs of India. General Sykes' efforts were therefore chiefly directed to investigating the cases of the principal local Persian ' Democrates ' who had not fled the town. A number of these were brought to book and sentence w 7 as passed on them. A few of the more important of these cases may be mentioned, as in each instance after General Sykes' departure strenuous attempts were made by the Persian Government and others to have his judgments annulled. Shahriar Khuda Bakhsli and Sons and Bustam Kaikhasrau and Sons, the Gabri firm known as &lt;£ Surushiyan ' and Kayanian,' were sentenced to pay compensation and a fine, amounting in all to 17,?00 tomans, for having bought much of the stock of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Limited, from the Germans, which they afterwards disposed of at a great profit. This payment was to be made in seven fortnightly instalments of 2,500 tomans. The delinquents at once succeeded in obtaining the good offices of the Bussian Consul and later of the Russian Legation, who urged that they were leaseholders of the Amin-i-Zarb a Russian protege, and it was proposed that the case should be re-examined by Hh Majesty's Consul and his Russian colleague. To this His Majesty's Consul objected, and His Majesty's Minister succeeded, it would appear, in inducing the Russians to drop the matter. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs was then invoked and, apparently without notifying the British authorities, sent orders to the Karguzar that only30 PERSIAN GU1F ADMINISTRATION EEPORT. 7,400 tomans was to be recovered and that anything paid in excess of this was to be refunded. This was in the end of September, and the payments of the instalments had long before this become irregular and finally failed after 9,479 tomans had been paid up. His Majesty's Consul of course kept the money safely lodged in the Bank and protested to Tehran. No further demands for refunds were made, but neither was any more money paid in. In the end of October, acting on private information, His Majesty's Consul suggested that the matter might be settled by indirectly letting Surusbivan and Kayanian know that if they paid up the balance due their names would be removed from the Black List. He believed that they had suffered consi derably from the stoppage of their business and that the knowledge that it required only a wave of the pen to restore them to the Black List would suffice to keep them cut of serious mischief. This proposal was eventually carried into effect; payment was completed on 80th November, and the removal of the names of the two firms from the Black List was notilled in His JVlajesty's Minister's circular telegram of the 24th December. This man acted as German Agent in Bam, where he flew the German Tho Nusrat-ui-Muik of j am. over his house and decorated his men with German badges. He was responsible for the ill-treatment of the British and Russian News-writers, and also for the destruction of part of the Indo-European Telegraph Line. He was ordered by General Sykes to pay a fine of 10,000 tomans and to be kept in detention in Kerman until payment was made. He had paid nothing by the time General Sykes had left and declared his inability to find the money. Many futile attempts were made from various quarters to induce His Majesty's Consul to remit or reduce the amount of the fine. Not a penny was paid and the JNusrat-ul-Mulk continued as a detenu in the Karguzari, where he aroused much alarm and despondency in the breast of the Kar^uzar by developinff symptoms of a popular but unpleasant disease. Towards the end of October the Persian Foreign Minister raised questions as o is guilt. Happily His Majesty s Minister was able to prevent the matter going turther, and an arrangement was arrived at in Kerman by which the iNusrat-ul-Mulk undertook to make payment in kind of 1,000 kharwars of wheat and barley. His Majesty's Consul accepted this offer and, on 14th No\ emher, notified that he had no objection to his being released. The grain is said to W been collected, but it has yet to be taken over and disposed of. k tn toflf p a t? 6 sum 1 ma . y be ''caused by its sale.

No news has been received of the recovery of the fine from Saiyid Mustafa. There is a little doubt but that the Aluin and his brother Agha Mahinud and Agha Muhammad are incessantly at work in the town secretly promoting the Democratic Cause. At present the fashion is to talk in favour of law and order, and though the Ehtisham-ud-Daulah is believed to have established relations with them which would enable him to use their services if at any time he judged that local disturbances would favour his game against the Sardar Nusrat, the Muin brotherhood are afraid to act except in secrecy, and feel it politic to profess great devotion to British interests and the occupant of His Majesty's Consulate. This attitude may go on being forced on them indefinitely, but their presence in the town has undoubtedly a disturb ing effect on people's minds. There is certainly a strong, if small, body of whole-hearted Democrats, and the Turkish successes in August and later Local Democrats. egca p e 0 f the prisoners in Sirjan gave them hope and material to work on. ' Shabnamabs ' against constituted authority and in favour of the Turks were posted in public places in the town on more than one occasion. One Mirza Kazim, a school teacher, was brought to book, and His Majesty's Consul was able to arrange for his deportation to Basrah, where he arrived early in November. His Majesty's Consul is the constant recipient of all sorts of secret and alarmist reports regarding the plots and doings of Democrats in the town and also in Eafsinjan. If he acted on them the population of Kerman would by now have been seriously diminished. He has preferred to take the line of not allowing what is sometimes nervousness, sometimes personal malice, to acquire spurious importance by gaining the active notice of His Majesty's Consulate, while at the same time letting it be understood that his knowledge of what is going on is considerably more extensive and exact than it is. The results up to &amp; the present of this policy appear to justify it. The difficulty is that there is not a single individual from prince to pauper who can be trusted. Ihe Governor-General's entourage and officials are constantly accused of Democrat sympathies, and the Sardar Nusrat is all the time pursuing his own obscure policy designed to provide against all contingencies. His main hope is no doubt in the British, but many of the enemies of the British and of his own enemies are worth placating. The public have no doubt who the persons were who attempted to murder Mashhadi Hussainoff, Agent of Messrs. Haji IsmailBarunu. Castelli and Kazan, in December 1915. It is common knowledge ' that they were Muhammad Ismail Barunu Muhammad Zaghu, Muhammad Nasrullah, and Muhammad Ghulam Hussain. In November 1916 Muhammad Ismail &lt;c Barunu ' was reported to have returned to the town and to be in hiding, and on 21st November he was arrest ed. His Majesty's Consul arranged with the Governor-General for his trial. The case was made over to a strong Commission and His Majesty s Consul attended the proceedings—(if any reason is required Hussainoff has some cjami to protection as representing a firm which enjoys British^ protection)—-w nicn were lengthy. The opinion ' arrived at by the Commission was t la e man had probably actually fired at Hussainoff and had certainly heen one or th3 band who attempted his life. The usual difficulties were encountered trom Tehran but it proved unnecessary to invoke the aid of His Majesty s .Legation, and His Majesty's Consul was able to despatch Barunu to the Coast on ins way to imprisonment lor life. He reached Basrah safely early in 1^ ebruary 191 7. Two other deportations were effected after full enquiry. Saiyid Hussain, alias Sona Shah, a man of doubtful British Indian or Afghan nationality, who appears to have knocked about Sistan and Baluchistan for many years m tne character of a derwesh, turned up in September in Bam, \\ r ere his P 0 ssi e objects gave rise to conjecture. His Majesty's Consul had him broug t o32 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION EEPOET Kerman, and as it appeared that he had a peculiar intimacy with most of the principal characters of Baluchistan and was in the habit of travelling about from one to another, not as a mendicant but with horse and rifle, and was well-qualified to be a political agent, it was considered advisable to make him move on further afield. He was deported to Basrah in Isovember. Apparently a bastard Persian Baluch, though for the purposes of begging he gave himself out as a British iLdian Ahmad Dashtyan. subject; made his appearance in Ker man in October. Prom enquiries it appeared that he had once served in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, that he iiad bem for a short time, in 1915, in the employment of Wassmuss at Behbehan and that he had thence made his way here via Yezd. As he was a Persian subject and there was nothirg definifc'e against him and he seemed too stupid to be dangerous, steps w r ere taken to see that he carried out his professed intention of proceeding on pilgrimage to Meshed. It has been found impossible to make headway with the case. It is . . , universally stated here that the actual Murderers of Farukhsnan, cousin of the Agna t tt u • p ■, murderers were Uasnim, son of Ghulam Hussain, and Saiyid Masballa, son of Saiyid Hassan. Beyond that, there are varying tales as to the connection of other persons with crime It may he that the Iftikbar-us-Sadat lent himself to forwarding the plot as believed by Colonel Ducat, but if this is a fact, it would be absolately impossible to prove it. He was already a persona grata with the South Persia Rifles when His Majesty's Consul arrived, and he has made himself useful in various ways. He is not a man to place faith in, but he is at present strongly and usefully pro-British and will probably remain so as long as the British are dominant. The late Hono rary Vice-Consul was, it is believed, inimical to him and to various others with whom the relations of the Consulate in past years might otherwise perhaps have been better. Information has lately been received that the accused Hashim is in impri sonment in Ispahan. The following men who played an active part in the disturbances in Noted Democrafs concerned in the di.tnrb.nce, German are imprisoned in SUraz, where »t Kerman in 1915, their cases are being investigated under the supervision of His Majesty's Consul :— 1.

His Majesty's Consul strongly opposed the appoint ment, and His Majesty's Minister wss able to get orders sent down that, while he was allowed to return to Kerman, he would hold no official position. It is said now that he is in fact exercising the functions of several officers including those of Kais-i-Muarif, but the fact has not come officially to His Majesty's Consul's notice. The Majd on arrival climbed off his fence with much empressement on the British side, and has been blandishing His Majesty's Consul with much assiduity. The latter has assured him that he will not in terfere with him as long as he does not behave so as to create disturbances. The Majd is a potentially dangerous man with a plausible tongue and a pleasing sense of humour. He defends himself from the malicious tongues of enemies by pointing proudly to his spotless past record. In August, when the public mind was dangerously affected by the news „ ,^ of the Russian reverses, and the hidden The Public safety. ... p ji -nv j- j activities or the Democratic party were at their height, various measures were concerted by the Commandant, South Persia Eifles, the Governor-General, Sardar Nusrat and His Majesty's Consul. Arrangements were made for the Officer Commanding, South Persia Rifles, to take over effective charge of the dilapidated collection of artillery reposing in the town. Breech blocks were found missing, carriages wheelless, saddlery in shreds, and horse teams non-existent. So far as practicable these defects were removed but it remains that there is only one gun (9 cm) which is even now lit to take the field. The question of the supply of breech blocks (7 cm) and ammunition is at present under reference by Eis Majesty's Consul to Tehran. At the same time His Majesty's Consul considered it advisable to take steps to prevent tbe districts, as far as possible, from falling into the hands of hostile forces whether of an anti-British or a purely predatory nature, and at the same time to secure some hold on the more important and more dangerous tribes. He therefore discussed with the local authorities the question of tem porarily raising bodies of local levies in such potential centres of danger as Sirjan Baft and Zarand. The financial side of the matter was considered and assistance to the extent of 10,000 Tomans was placed at the disposal of the Consulate by His Majesty's Minister. At this point, however, the South Per sia Eifles came forward and expressed their readiness to undertake the pay ment, and, as far as practicable in face of the deficiency of officers, the control of the proposed forces of Local Levies. Captain Merrill, when he was sent to Sirjan in August to arrange for the forwarding of the prisoners, was also commissioned to stay on in Sirjan and raise a force of local tribesmen. When the prisoners had resolved themselves into a Will-o'-the-Wisp he set about the work and succeeded in raising a force of nearly 400 men. They did not prove very helpful, but their presence, nominally on our side, and their acceptance of our money had undoubtedly a political value which was not without effect on the Military situation. Since the arrival of the British Column they were gradually reduced to a strength of 185 men. A force of 100 Afshar, assembled in Baft as part of the general scheme, have proved very useful in work on the Bandar Abbas road and have fully justified their entertainment. Levies were also raised at Zarand but, in November, when it became evident that danger was not to be anticipated on that side, they were disband ed. A number of them are believed to have enlisted in the regular South Persia Rifles. Another step taken was to introduce a censorship. All the Persian tele graph offices on the Kerman and Yezd line were cut off and all messages had to pass through the Indo-European Telegraph Department offices at Kerman and Yezd where they were examined. The Telegraph Master in Kerman (a trustworthy man, Mirza Ahmad Khan) fell in with these arrangements and he was provided with accommodation and allowed to work for a month or so in the Indo-European Telegraph Department34 PEESIAN GULP ADMINISTRA'lION EEPOET office. These measures were abandoned in the course of a month or two, sine® when the normal arrangements have been in force. At the same time a censorship on the Persian Post Office was established by the Governor- General. Over this His Majesty's Consul was not in a posi- tion to exercise any control, but it would appear to have been worked in a hona fide, as well as in a reasonable, way. Efforts were made by His Majesty's Consul, as far as the means at his disposal permitted, to circulate information calculated to counteract the pro- Tark-cum-German legends which were constantly being spread about by the Democrats, and to give the people some idea of the real situation. Extracts of important news received in Reuters or from other sources were translated and distributed to the principal authorities and people likely to give them currency. The work has been handicapped by the want of any Persian with sufficient know ledge of English to be able to translate and the lack of any means of mecha nical production. Later 50 copies of the Vernacular Edition of the ' Basrah Times ' were ordered and at the present time (March) four copies are being distributed free as complimentary copies, 24 copies are being issued to subscribers and the remainder are placed in the hands of an Agent to try and sell in the Bazaar. Copies of the '* Haqiqat ' received from Basrah are distributed free with the ' Times.' Copies of both have also been ordered for the use of the South Persia llifles and the troops at Sirjan, and copies have been sent to all principal outlying towns in the hope of securing more sub scribers. It would be much easier to make an indefinitely large free distribu tion, but His Majesty's Consul is convinced that the paper will receive more attention and carry greater weight if it is paid for. Other occasional docu ments of a propagandist nature have been procured from Basrah and have been distributed in the town and districts. A serious difficulty has been the unsatisfactory working of the Postal Service between Bandar Abbas and Kerman, of which more will be said further on. Keference has already been made to the character and relations of the Town and Provmoi.i in.ir.. ° hief Provincial Authorities. The district Governorships are divided between {&lt; Prince's men ' and ' Sardar's men.' The following are occupied by Sardar's men :— Bam and Narmashir .... Sardar Mujallal (son-in-law). Av^ta Afehar. (Baft) .... JSlnlitashim-ud-Daulah (uncle). Ilafsin i ai1 Salar Mufakhkham (uncle) (till recently Zahir-ul-Huzur follow er of the Prince). The principal appointments held by the Prince's nominees are :— Siijan • • • • Mirza Mabmud Khan iNayini) Jabal Bam, Isfandaqah and Melmi . .

A large number of big cara vans have come up safely for the South Persia iiities in earlier cases without escorts, and the two parties of Indian reinforcements under Lieutenant Eraser and Captain Wagstaff made their way up safely in August without being attacked. In September the South Persia Eifles placed a party of Afshar levies under a local Persian on the road, with their headquarters at Baft. They appear to have worked very w r ell and with their help the delivery of the telegraph material along the road up to Kerman was safely carried out. Large quanti ties of food supplies have also been, and are still being, brought down from Eafsinjan and laid out for the telegraph party at Deh Sard, Dashtab, Baft and Qala Askar, Up to the present this traffic has gone on without contretemps. The construction of the telegraph line, which has now (3rd March) passed Daulatabad, and the work of various road-survey parties has also been carried out witbout molestation within Kerman territory. This is a highly satisfactory state of affairs. The same unfortunately cannot be said for the Yezd road which has seldom enjoyed freedom from Ears robbers, for many weeks on end. A force of 30 (nomina ly 50) Bakhtiaris was detailed to support the Qarasuran, who w r hen present on the scene at all are themselves suspect, and seems on the whole to have done useful, if not entirely satisfactory, service, considering its quite inadequate strength. In December the Salar Mufakhkham was appointed to the Governorship of KaMnjan. He w r as given some reinforcements and w T as specially instructed to endeavour to restore security on the road He has been active and as suc cessful as could be expected. A difficulty has been the deficiency of ammuni tion for the local forces. All that was obtainable locally was bought up and His Majesty's Consul endeavoured, but without success, to obtain fresh supplies from Mask at and the Gulf Ports Later His Majesty's Minister held out hopes of the possibility of supplying some of the many kinds of rifle ammunition required from Tehran, but the matter has not up to the present progressed beyond this stage. The bulk of the raiding took place between Anar and Yezd, but on one or two occasions robberies were carried out as far west as Kabutar Khan. In one of these the much suffering JVJajd-ul-Islam w r as stripped, to the malicious delight of his enemies. The raiders appear to be chiefly Lashanis, Chaharrahis and Tulakis. The so-called ' Baharlu, ' or Earsi raids did not stop short at the Yezd road. The district of Zarind was plundered by Ears bands, and a caravan w^as looted as far north as Chilpaya, at a spot convenient ly stated by the local authorities to be beyond Kerman, and in Khorasan, territory. Turning to the other end of the Province, relations were strained, at any rate at the end of the year, between the Zargham-us-Saltanah of Kahnu (Rudbar) and Nawab Khan Bameri. Exaggerated reports of active hostilities w 7 ere re ceived, but nothing very serious in fact took place until, apparently in Novem ber, Chiragh Khan and Mir Murad Khan, described as leading men of Jalq, Dizak, returning home with three other men from a visit to the Zargham-us- Saltanah were ambushed by Jallal Khan, son of Nawab Khan. Eour of the party are stated to have been killed and one to have escaped (according to Major Keyes, vidj his Diary No. 1^, dated 16th December 1916, Murad Khan was killed and Chiragh Khan dangerously wounded). The Zargham-us- Saltanah swore vengeance on the murdereis of his late guests, but it is under stood that he has lately entered into pourparlers _ wdth Nawab Khan, with a view to a peaceful adjustment. He wrote to His Majesty's Consul, obviously but not ostensibly in this connection, asking for assistance in obtaining cartrid ges, and his failure to receive any may have led him to give up the idea of trying conclusions with Nawab Khan in war. The general view T of Nawab Khan in Kerman is that he has fallen from grace. Whereas he used always to be on the side of Government, it is said that he, or his sons, have now taken to lawless courses. r 236 PERSIAN GUIT' ADMINISTRATION REPORT Of internal disturbances, as has been already said, Kerman has been remarkably free. There is said to be a nest of Democrats in Kafsmjan and at times reports of secret meetings and plots have been ril e, but, while a watch has been kept and enquiries made from time to time, no necessity to take any decisive measures has arisen. In Bam a,so there have been people who have made it their business to spread false reports of lurk victories and who are said to receive their inspiration from &lt; Kerman, but there the situation has been even less serious than in Rafsmjan. yVni e a passable semblance of unity of purpose among the Governing Authorities and the Con sulate in Kerman can be maintained, there is little to be feared fiom the Democrats and pro-Turks whether in the city itself or in the Districts. Since the return of the British the working of the various Goverament departments has fallen much more within the purview of His Majesty s Con sulate than in past years. The initiative in this has come^ from the Persian Authorities who love to disburden themselves of responsibilities^ by consulting the Consulate and demanding 'instructions' or an 'opinion ' from it on every conjeivable question. Information of every kind, except with regard to personal interests and schemes, is given freely. Unfortunately the mission is a serious one and much vigilance has to be exercised in order to avoid becoming a tool of pri vate policy or ambition. His Majesty's Consul has aimed at keeping clear of what does not affect British interests and of plying the unexceptionable part of adviser, rather than that of dictator. The maximum of useful result is probably in reality to be obtained in this way. Thus the removal of the Zahir-ul-Huzur from the Governorship of Rafsinjan was secured without its ever having been actually suggested, while the dismissal of the Muhtashim-ud- Daulah from Baft was delayed till he came to terms with the Governor-Gene ral, by which time, as it happened. His Majesty's Consul himself was prepared to acquiesce in his removal. Many dismissals could and might well be effect ed if there was any hope of obtaining less objectionable incumbents. A case in point is the Adl-us-Sultan who has for years maladministered to his own profit that expensive, corrupt and thoroughly inefficient body the Qarasuran, or Koad Police, which imposes an annual burden of 60,000 tomans on the local finances. The South Persia Rifles have already taken over the adminis tration of the Qarasuran, and the funds allotted for them, on the Kerman- Bandar Abbas road between Kerman and Daulatabad As the powers and organization of the South Persia Rifles grow, that force will, it is to be hoped, by degrees oust and replace the Qarasuran everywhere. The most important of the Administration Departments is undoubtedly Eeveuuo Department. the Revenue Department. On it depends the supply of funds for all the services, and however funds may be misapplied they are no less necessary in Persia than elsewhere. TV hatever other obscure sources of revenue they may have, officials will not work without their official salaries. The collection of the revenue during the past year has been more than usually unsatisfactory. In the early part of the year the Government of the Province was practically in abeyance. Asadullah Khan, Kurdistani, who had been appointed Head of the Revenue Department, arrived in the middle of the disturbances and was unable to exercise his functions, and when the situation cleared up with the arrival of General Sykes^ he was recalled from Tehran and the Banan -ud- Daulah was appointed in Irs stead. The Banan carried on for a few months fair y efficiently when he in turn learnt that he was to give place again to Kurdi.stsm and, as is usual in such cases, spent the remainder of his time in tilling or replenishing his pockets^ His Majesty's Consul opposed this change as ig uy undesirable in principle and because there was a good deal of local op position to K urdist mi, but without success. The Banan left in November and the bnaikh-ul-Mulk held acting charge until Kurdistani's arrival, in anuary 7. Kurdistani is a man of action, energy, and pluck, and what- TwL^f 61 ° j e ct s _he may keep in view, he is certainly anxious to make his Th?Pn? 18 ? cien ^ no ^ afraid of the enmity which that must entail. honH tW u 6 rres i fin ^, clal y ear will be a very difficult period, but it is at 14 ma y bu Possible to start the next one with a clean slate.FOR THE YEAR 1916. 37 The town Police, in spite of various changes of their chief, have been fairly satisfactory, and since the sappres- Pohc0, sion of an outbreak of Democrat ' Night placards' and of housebreaking, in September, there has been little crime in the town. Reference to these has already been made. The value of the force is ' purely negative. They do little or no- Qarasuran (Roadguards . thing to prevent robberies, but if Qara- suran were not maintained, and if pay and allowances ostensibly for maintain ing Qarasuran were not made to certain tribal chiefs, such as Ghunj Ali Khan, Afshar, who receives about 400 toman 4 ! per mensem, it is probable that robberies of travellers and caravans would be even commoner than they are. That the postal service should work at all is, considering the means employed, something of a The Post office. miracle, but the miracle is tantalising and insufficient. On the Yezd-Tehran line the posts have frequently been held up for weeks, when they have escaped being robbed. The average time now-a-days which letters take to come from Tehran is 5 weeks. In 1913 they used to reach London from Kerman in the same number of weeks, or less. From the British point of view the Bandar Abbas^ postal service is much the most important, and it has reached a degree of inefficiency which is unparalleled in the past. In November and December incomplete mails were taking 35 and 40 days to come up from Bandar Abbas to Kerman. The average time in 1913-14 was 16 days, which was quite unnecessarily slow. His Majesty's Consul has been agitating the question since November, both locally and in Tehran, with as yet but slender results. A rapid service by ridinc camels which was to carry the post from Bandar Abbas to Daulatabad in 4-5 davs and cost 150 tomans per mensem was promised, but it was no sooner instituted than it broke down. It is now (in March) being reorganised by the South Persia llifles. On the upper section a direct service from Daulatabad via Baft to Kerman was sanctioned and after much pressure on the local authorities has been realised. Formerly the post lost^ several days by going round by Saidabad (Sirjan) and Bahramabad. A subsidiary service from Baft now supplies the needs of Sirjan and Bahramabad. These changes have incurred an increase in the expenditure Budget of GO tomans per mensem raising it from 75 tomans to 135 tomans. The actual work of the post office at Bandar Abbas has given rise to much dissatisfaction. Letters and parcels are^ often delayed in despatch and those of one week are sometimes received in Kerman before those of the preceding one. Postage is also frequently charged on articles alieady su - ciently stamped. Redress is almost impossible owing to the slowness and uncertainty of the post itself, and the shortness of life It is absolute y necessary now that Kerman wdth its Military and commercial interests should have a reasonably rapid and reliable postal service, and this will on y le obtained by placing the conveyance of the mails in the hands or the feoutn Persia Rifles, when they are ready to undertake it. This is not a case m which we can afford to study the susceptibilities of Persian inefficiency. Baluchistan has long lain outside the control of the Governor-General of ' Kerman and Baluchistan,' and m such Baluchistan. relations as existed in recent years Balu chistan played the active and the Kerman province the passive part, for Baluch raiding parties j early visited Jiruft, Narmashir and Khabis and sometimes penetrated as far as Tahrud on the East, and Eawar on the North, of Kerman citv. This vear the Baluch have been provided with entertainment nearer home by General Dyer and his troops, with the result that Kerman has enjoyed on this side such peace as had become a myth of the b-olden age. When General Sykes arrived in Kerman our forces were operating in the East of Baluchistan. Bahram Khan of Bampur had not come within range of their military operations, but he was alarmed, and began writing, apparently in June, to the Sardar Nusrat and Sardar Mujallal expressing fear that the British intended to annex Baluchistan and professing willingness on38 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTKATIOlS BEPOET the part of himself and Hussain Khan, son of Said Khan, to accept a Persian Governor appointed from Kerman. General Sykes, with the concurrence of the Persian authorities in Kerman, recommended that thj Alu^am-us-Saltanah, a Bam notable, should be appointed Governor and proceed with a small body of Persian sowars to Bampur, where he should set about collecting revenue on a reduced scale. This proposal was, however, negatived by the Government of India and the Akram-us-Saltanah was informed that his services would not be required. Major Keyes, in September, complained that Bahrain Khan had been renewing his invitation to the Governor-General of Kerman to appoint a Persian Governor and that correspondence had been passins between Bahrain Khan and the Sardar Nusrat and the Akram-us-Saltanah, The matter was followed up and His Majesty's Consul judged it advisable to summon the Akram-us-Saltanah to Kerman in order to keep him out of evil or the suspicion of evil. It appeared later that at least the correspondence complained of had taken place while General Sykes' proposal was still on the tapis. The Akram- us-Saltanah was detained for more than a month in Kerman in a friendly way, and was then given permission, on 29th November, to return to Bam. There is no reason to believe that the Persians would now be the least more capable of governing Baluchistan unaided than they have been during the last ten years. A number of matters connected with British interests have remained as a legacy from the German-cum-Democrat .British Interests. , • , n i • i i • /. „ occupation, to some or which brief refer ence may be made.

Majesty's Consul, Sistan, of enemy agents who might be expected to enter Kerman territory from the north or east. All possible measures have been taken to secure the arrest of any such agents v ho might make their appearance, but without any tangible result. These two Indians, who had remained in Kerman during the German The capes of Fa eh Muhammad and Fakir occupation, were arrested by General Muhammad. Sykes. The former, who had been for eight years clerk in His Majesty's Consulate before he was dismissed for incom petence and uatrustworthiness by the present Consul, in 1914, w r as accused of having communicated information to the Germans and of having subsequencly entered their service. The latter, in happier days, servant of General Sykes, was believed to have joined the Germans in the capacity of cook. Both were with the Austrian Bia^h in Bam, but claimed that they had been taken there virtually as prisoners under force majeure. His Majesty's Consul received instructions, and was given poweis, to try these men on his arrival, but he fell ill before he was able to take the matter up and it was not till the beginning of October that investigation was begun. It was then found thai the local evidence was insufficient. The question of how to deal with the prisoners was under reference to higher authority—until the end of the year, and in January 1917 it was finally decided that Fateh Muhammad should be sent to India under the provisions of the c&lt; Ingress Ordinance,' and that Eakir Muhammad, against whom there was no suspicion of any very serious offence apart from that of having accepted the pay of the enemy for menial services, should be released. His Majesty's Consul has no official information regarding the origin or Souvh Persia Eiil eB . of tj' 9 force. It came to birth at Bandar Abbas m April with the style and title of South Persia Military Police. In August, it became known as the South Persian Army and, in September, it was officially christened the South Persia Eifles, to which name it has since remained faithful. It is a pity that it was not possible to find a suitable title which would have lent itself to repro duction in Persian mouths, as ' Gendarmerie ' and Gendarme ' did, terms still applied by the common people to the South Persia Bifles. The enlightened call the force the- Qushiun-i-Janub, cacophonous perhaps but pronounceable, but the South Persia Rifleman remains nameless and unnamable. A beginning was at once made with enlistment in Bandar Abbas and the history of the force there will doubtless be written by the local officials. Major Farran, Captain Eowle, and Captain Merrill, also Captain Husband, i. M.S., accompanied General Sykes to Kerman and, on arrival there, began organising the new force. They had a small staff of Indian Instructors, but they did not start w r ith a trained Persian nucleus and a supply of Persian officers as the Swedish Gendarmerie officers did Only a small party of ex- Gendarmes and one officer were secured and engaged. Of necessity, too, there was a dearth of horses, saddlery and other material, and it is very creditable to the three officers that, by the end of the year, they should have been able to carry the organisation so far as to have 50 Artillery, 398 Cavalry and 429 Infantry under training, while maintaining the forces of local levies at Saida- bad and Baft which have been referred to above. The strength in British officers was increased by the arrival of Captain Wagstaff and Lieutenant Carr, but they were detained in Sirjan by the condi tion of affairs there until nearly the end of the year. Early in 1917 it is hoped that the British staff will stand somewhat as follows:—• Military Offcers ......... 10 Medical Officers 2. Warrant Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers. . . . 19 When all these have made their first steps in the knowledge of the people and the language the disproportion between the work to be done and the men40 PERSIAN GULI' ADMINISTRATION REPOEi available to do it will be less marked than it has been up to the present. But credit will always be due to the few pioneers who had to contend with a plethora of work encumbered by many unfamiliar dimcu ties. Endeavours are bein^ made to enlist the rnost suitable material 'wliich the Province can supply- The main element will probably always be villagers chosen from the agricultural classes of the healthiest districts. It is difficult to o-et hold of the men of the nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes, but this difficulty will probably be overcome to some extent in the course of time. Che city man, as bein 0 ' generally a weaver or a loafer, and frequently diseased, is now eschewed, and many enlisted in the early days are being got rid of. There is not likely to be much trouble in getting as many men as can at present be dealt with,' and it is most important to start the force _ with high standards so that it may corae to be regarded as something of a distinction to be admitted into its ranks. If a low class of men forms an appreciable element, the better types may be expected to hold aloof. More difficult than the question of enlistment or even that of training and organisation without a trained indigenous staff, are the problems of accommodation, sanitation, and hygiene. The great prevalence of syphilis in the city is proving, and is likely to continue to prove, a very serious drawback to Kerman as the -Headquarters and training centre of the force. The relations of the South Persia Eifles with the local authorities, and with the people of the place have been very satisfactory, in pleasing contrast to those of their predecessors, the Swedish Gendarmerie. Some credit in this connection is due to the Governor-General and Sardar Nusrat who have displayed a very friendly and helpful spirit. The necessity for telegraphic and telephonic communication a 1 ong The Bandar Abbas-Kerraau telegraph line aud tile route to be protected by the South motor road. Peisia llifles between Bandar Abbas and Kerman was represented by General Sykes in April 1916. Another proposal which he took occasion to press at the same time was that of the construction of a road fit for motor lorries between the same two points. He proposed that this should follow the Tang-i-Zindan—Baft route. General Sykes laid stress on the actual importance of Bandar Abbas, and the greater importance which it might acquire in the future. ' It will in the future, I am confident,' he said, 'be the chief sea port of Southern Persia and may, through the discovery of oil-bearing strata in the neighbourhood, outvie the ancient glories of Ormuz, its island predecessors.' In August the question of route to be followed was raised and General Sykes again expressed his opinion in favour of fhat vtd Daulatabad and Baft, and at the end of the month it was intimated that the construction of a telegraph line following this route had been sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India and instructions were issued for arrangements to be made for the protection of the construction party, as also of an engineer who vvas to be sent to examine and report on measures necessary for the improvement of the road. With some trouble arrangements were made for the protection of the telegraph party in Bandar Abbas territory by men provided by the South Persia Bifles and the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas, and by guards to be provided by Ali Khan in Ahmadi territory. These arrangements have so far^worked fairly well and no serious robbery or other trouble has been e ^P erienc ®d, though Ali Khan has, as was to be expected, shown himself shirty and unreliable and faint-heartedly exacting.

On his reporting to this effect work on the telegraph line was stopped, as it had, of course, been intended that the road and telegraph should be companions, and considerable delay ensued. The line had not been completed up to the top of the Tang-i-Zindan by the end of the year. To anticipate, it may be mentioned that it was eventually working through to Daulatabad on 18th Eebruary 1917. Meanwhile, in November and December, the material for the line was despatched on ahead and deposited at various stages right up to Baghin 15 miles from Kerman, but off the line. Arrangements made for the escorting of these caravans of material worked satisfacforily and. no reports of robbery or loss were received. Large quantities of supplies of grain and fodder for the working party and its transport had also to be arranged for over the section between Daulatabad and Nigar in which no local supplies were to be obtained owing to the ravages of locusts. The question was mooted in November when the purchase and delivery of the grain and fodder required could have been easily and rapidly effected; unfortunately, however, some six weeks' delay ensued before sanction was received by the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Kerman to provide the necessary funds. The weather then broke and snow on the passes has made the work very difficult. Returning to the question of the road, after finding that the Tang-i-Zindan route was impracticable. Major Hich and his assistants examined the country further to the east but no satisfactory solution was found in that quarter. Major Rich then came up to Kerman which he did not reach, however, till the middle of January. He was of opinion that the route to be followed, if, as seems probable, it is practicable, would be that via Tang-i-Zindan and Sirjan, and he proceeded to return to Bandar Abbas by the Deh Bakri-Jiruft route with the intention of once again travelling up to Kerman this time by the Tang-i-Zagh route. This question, especially as it affects ladies, was raised on several occasions ^ ^ from different quarters. By the end of Eeturn of British Sumects to Kerman. , tt . ,1-1 JSovember His Majesty s Consul, who had previously advised against permission being granted to ladies or persons not immediately serving the interests of Government to come to Kerman, considered the local situation sufficiently satisfactory to justify him in joining the rest of the community in asking for the embargo on ladies to be removed. The question was put up to the Government of India, but the Kazerun mishap then occurred and the proposal was vetoed. There is actually one lady and two children in Kerman, as Mr. May, Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, brought his family with him from Tehran.

There were one or two petty interruptions in com munication with India due to climatic causes, otherwise the only difficulties experienced have been excess of work and deficiency of staff. Mr. H. L.

The presence and financial requirements of the South Persia Rifles have thrown on the market^2 persian gulf administration report a large and constant supply of rupee drafts. At the end of the year, owing to till scarcity and high price of sugar and other imported articles in the iSorth of Persia local merchants began to forward large quantities of such goods to Meshed and even to Tabriz.

Later it was decided to 'withdraw the Russian Consul and close the Consulate, Russian interests being intrusted to the charge of His Majesty's Consul. M. ChiraiefF left Kerman for Meshed with his escort of Cossacks in September having made practically no pretence of handing over to His Majesty's Consul w r ho was confined to bed at the time. The withdrawal of the Russian representative has thrown a considerable amount of vexatious and thankless work on His Majesty's Consul. The Russians have no subjects and practically no permanent interest in Kerman, but they maintain a host of Persian Agents in the districts who all frequently require help and protection in their private affairs. His Majesty's Consul has received and attended to appeals from Russian Agents in Bam, Sirjan, Rafsinjan (two Agents) and Anar (a family and dependants). The interest of two Russian Agents in Yezd have also claimed attention. Many of the appeals made are such as would not be listened to by His Majesty's Consul as British Consul, and some of them have been troublesome and have con sumed much valuable time. It is unnecessary to w r aste more time on writing about them in detail here. The following Foreign non-British firms bare representatives at present Foreign Busines's Firm. in Kerman Messrs.

Gunter was in political charge of the Mekran Coast through out the year. ' Personnel. The number of arms imported into Persian Mekran during the year was 50 rifles and a small quantity of ammuni- Gun-runmug. ^ comparison of the statements of imports for the year 1915 shows a great decrease, probably owing to the exhaustion of the supply of arms on the Arab Coast. Mr. Pinsent's reports on the traffic are enclosed. The year under report was comparatively quiet. The chief events can be summarised as follows :— Persian Baluchistan. Khalifah Muhammad Timer, mentioned in last year's report, continued to *live at Namurdi. His attitude was inimical and he would probably have been the cause of unrest had he survived. He sent in several claims against the Shaikh of Debai and against other persons at Debai which, on enquiry, were found baseless. In August he was murdered by his own slaves and two of Mir Barkat's ryots. The murderers were caught and shot by Mir Barkat. The chief took over the belongings of the deceased. In January, in view of the importance of the Jask Telegraph line to the forces in Mesopotamia, the Political Resident arranged that extra subsidies should be paid for its protection from the British border to Jask. These subsidies were first sanctioned for six months from 1st January and were renewed for another six months from 1st July. Khalifah Khair Muhammad was in Kerman district for the greater part of the year. Extensive damage to the telegraph line was done by Jowshdans at his instigation. During the last four months of the year little has been ^ ear d of Khair Muhammad who has gone to Moganshaboo. This seriously interfered with the telegraph traffic with the Persian Gulf and Basrah, and it was decided to lay a cable between Charbar and Jask as an alternative to the land-line. This was done on 31st August. The lines between Charbar and Jask were interrupted owing to wilful damage for— 37 hours during February, 361 „ „ March, 88 „ „ April, 28 „ „ May, 24 „ „ June, 18 „ „ J^iy, and 89 „ „ November. With the approval of the Political Resident, half of all the March extra subsidies was disallowed. In January Islam Khan captured and sent to Charbar a German or Turkish Agent. Under instructions from the Political Resident he was sent to Basrah. A reward of Rs. 5,000 was paid to Islam Khan. Sardar Saiyid Khan died at Gaih towards the end of April. He was always friendly to the British Government and his death is a distinct loss. His heir, Hussain Khan, is a minor. Sardar Islam Khan was appointed his guardian by Saiyid Khan. In July a dispute arose between Islam Khan's eldest son and his uncle, Mirza Khan, which resulted in the death of Mirza Khan. This led to strained g 24i4i PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT relations between Islam Khan and his brothers Sahib Khan and Nagdi Khan, but a reconciliation through the good offices of neighbouring chiefs, including Mir Barkat of Biaban and Mir Mustafa Khan, appears likely. In December it was reported that Hussain Khan and his party had been fired on from Gaih fort by men under Mir Ahmed Khan, son-in-law of Mir Islam Khan. There were several casualties on both sides. Mir Islam Khan was at Oharbar and, on hearing news of fighting, he sent Mir Mahmud Khau of Eanooch with a letter to Mir Ahmed Khan, reprimanding him and ordering him to evacuate the fort and to return to Bint. These orders were carried out by Mir Ahmed Khan. This incident increased the ill-feeling against Islam Khan and eventually led to his ceasing to be the guardian of Hussain Khan. Mir Asraf Khan of Bahu has settled a greater part of his debts. A very small sum remains against him. The claims against other chiefs and people of Persian Mekran are in the same condition as in last year. No foreign subiects resided at the ports oreign su jec s. 0 f ^ Mekran Coast during the year.

On the up journey Sardars Saiyid Khan and Islam Khan were interviewed at Charhar and Mir Barkat near Jask. On the return journey the Director again met Islam Khan at Charbar. Interviews also took place with Sardar Mahmud Khan and Din Muhammad Khan, of Dashtyari, Mustafa Khan and Mir Moti of Jask and with a son of Mir Moti of Lashat. The Director again left Karachi on cour of inspection on 17th November and visited all telegraph offices up to Hen jam and a portion of the new Bandar Abhas-Kerman Telegraph line, returning to Karachi on 4th December. Interviews with Sardar Islam Khan, who was at Charbar arranging for the transport of stores to Gaih for the Mekran Mission under Major Keyes. took place on the up and down journeys. Mr. Pinsent's report on the condition of the districts between Jask and Bahu is enclosed. JASK. Mr. A. Robertson was clerk-in-charge of the Telegraph station up to 15th May 1916.

They were sent to Basrah and thence deported to Burma. In Decem ber 1916, on receipt of a deposit of Bs. 2,000 and a bond for Bs. 3,000 from Sardar Islam Khan as security for their good behaviour, they were brought back to Charbar and released. As a temporary arrangement, pending the settlement of the Persian Cus toms subsidy for the protection of the village, the payment of Bs. 450 per mensem from 1st May was sanctioned by the Deputy Political Besident.

E, GUNTER, Karachi, Director^ Fersian Gulf Telegraphs, The 4th April 19.17. In Political Charge Makran Coast.FOR THE YEAR 1916. 47 Mr. Pinsent's report on the condition of the country between Jask and Bahu districts. Sardar Mustapha Khan continues to control this district of which he has been chief now for many years. The only Jask district. . • x x • • i. r t&gt; * item ot interest m this part 01 reisian Baluchistan was the sudden and unaccountable attitude adopted by Mir Nur Muhammad, half brother to the ruling chief, and also to Sardar Barkat Khan of Biaban when, during March last, he deliberately cut the telegraph lines at Gabreg on two occasions causing a total interruption to communication of over 111 hours. On the news being carried to Mir Mustapha Khan, the chief imme diately left Jask with the telegraph repairing party and as large a following as he could collect, and promptly settled the affair. Mir Barkat also assisted in this matter by writing strongly to Nur Muhammad threatening him, if he interfered with the lines again, he would come in person and drive him out of the country. Petty squabbles of no political importance have occurred at different times, the elder sons of Mustapha Khan being the culprits and their principal offence the looting of their father's ryots. The chief has seven sons, of whom two are minors. Commencing from 1st January 1916 additional subsidies of Es. 200 and Ks. 100 each per mensem have been paid to Mustapha Khan and Mir Hoti of the Jask district on the condition that no interference with the telegraph lines was permitted. Both these men have carried out their obligations to the best of their ability and took strong measures to settle Mir Nur Muhammad when that man cut the wires at the Gabreg. Mir Barkat Khan is the sole ruler of this district and also plays a promi- nent part in the affairs of Bashkard, the chiefs of the latter place being complete ly under his control. As far as I know, Barkat is loyal and willing to assist our Government in every way, though I am afraid the same cannot be said of his relations with the Persian Government. Unconfirmed reports arrive at intervals of the Minabis looting Barkat's ryots, who in. t arn retaliate. In my opinion no particular blame can be attached to either party, the people are all more or less uncivilised and looting will continue until very much stronger measures are adopted than has hitherto been the case. Barkat's relations with the sons of the late Mir Haji continue unsatisfactory and, I am afraid, will be the cause of trouble sooner or later, but when the trouble does come, if ever, it will be of no political importance. Barkat at present is strong enough to protect himself against all comers and is the right man for a district of the size and importance of Biaban. It is said that Mirza Khan of Budbar is endeavouring to effect a reconciliation between the two parties, but up to the time of writing no settlement has been arrived at. The most important event of the year in this district was the murder of Saiyid Muhammad Umer, an Afghan, who had taken refuge with Barkat on being turned out of Debai, a man who was frankly inimical towards our Gov ernment and probably would have been the cause of much unrest thi oughout the country had he survived. This man openly did all he could to spread unfavourable reports and even urged the people to rise, but the lesson learned by Khalifa Khair Muhammad and his followers on the attack of Charbar station had not been forgotten and was largely responsible towards discourag ing any openly hostile acts. No one appears to know why the Saiyid was murdered ; rumour has it that Barkat had the man removed ; others again say that the Persian Government had a hand in the affair. From reports received here it 'would appear that the murder was a particularly brutal and cold biood- ed one, some of the Saiyid's slaves and a couple of Barkat's ryots deliberate y cutting the man's throat on the way to the place where he usually prayed and then absconding with a portion of his valuables. Ail the murderers were eventually captured and executed by Barkat. It is diillcult to credit the48 PERSIAN GULr ADMINISTRATION REPOET reports in circulation concerning the property left by the Saiyid. Some say he was enormously rich for these parts and had besides a large number of rifles with a corresponding quantity of ammunition amongst his possessions. Others ridicule the idea and state he was only a trader on a small scale and died practically a poor man. Mir Barkat is credited with having taken over all the Saiyid's estate and report has it_ that over 500 rifles passed into his hands. This is, however, only a suspicion, unsupported by proof. Sardar Islam Khan, the recognised chief of these districts, has the Bint and Karnan. reputation of being a strong man and well disposed towards us, but he did not show up well during the earlier part of the year when great unrest prevailed in the Karwan district, the Khalifa Khair Muhammad for some unknown reason being permitted to cut the lines or urge the people to do so whenever it pleased him. The Joushdaris and other Karwanis, under the instigation of the Khalifa between February and July last, on eight occasions, interrupted communication between Jask and ^harbar, thus rendering the land -lines useless to Karachi and seriously interfering with the traffic between Meso potamia and India. The duration of interruptions during these months totalled 17 days, the cause varying from destruction of the lines to the removal of insulators. Islam ^Khan, when referred to, always replied to the effect that he was powerless to interfere with the Khalifa and his doings, as the man had all the country with him, and that he could only take steps to pacify the people when our Government came forward to assist him with munitions and men. Since August last little or nothing has been heard of the Khalifa ; from hein? openly hostile he appears to have quieted down and reports have come in that he was desirous of being friendly and it has also been said that he regretted his past conduct. At the time of wiiting the Khalifa is residing at Mo^ansha- boo, a village in the i5int district. About July last, in a squabble between Mirza Khan, one of Islam Khan's brothers and the son of the latter, the result of a dispute concerning the rio-ht to collect revenue in certain districts, a fight ensued at Bint and with it the death of Mirza Khan who was killed by a stray bullet. The first report received of the fight exaggerated the casualties which were said to be many ; later on it came to light that Mirza Khan was the only one to receive mortal injuries and that the cause was due to the man coming out in the open when both sides were firing wildly at the time. The death of Mirza Khan has heen the cause of a deal of friction between the younger brothers (Nagdi and Sahib Khan) and Islam Khan, the former asserting that the elder brother (Islam an) the instigator of his death and that his son had instructions to do away with him. But from information received such is not the case ; Mirza's death was the result of an accident ; if he had remained under cover until the subsided, no harm would have come to him. Several influential W, ii; ^ lng ? Ba '; kat J'f Biaban and Mir Mustafa Khan of Jask, are n S J\ ei ' Se - VeS 1 , n the affalr aild wil1 shortl y proceed to Bint with the intention of bringing about a reconciliation between the brothers.

The capture of Mir Shahdullah of Bir and seven followers at Charbar, on 27th March, follow ed by the deportation of the captives to Basrah and thence to India had a good effect on the country generally. This man was indirectly concerned in the attack on Charbar station, (May 1915), and one of his brothers was killed play ing a leading part for which he considered he was entitled to compensation from us and, for several months, sent in threatening messages to the effect that, if blood money was not forthcoming, he would loot the Charbar bazaar, take British-Indian subjects away as hostages, besides destroy the telegraph lines. Affairs reached a climax when Shahdullah appeared in person at Charbar with a number of followers and repeated his demands. The military authorities, assisted by the Navy, took immediate action which resulted in the capture of Shahdullah. This man was released after a few months and it is reported that he and his followers are much impressed with all they saw and with the kind treatment they received at the different stations during their detention. The fort at Bampur and the district has for the past few years been in charge of the Chief of Gaih with the sanction of the Kerman-Persian authori ties, but during the illness of Saiyid Khan preceding his death, control over this district was neglected, the consequence being that Bahram Khan of Dizak stepped in and refuses to vacate much to the indignation of Islam Khan who, as previously staled, is controlling the affairs of Gaih during the minority of Hussain Khan. Beyond threatening Bahram Khan to come in person with a large following and using force to remove him, Islam Khan has done nothing so far. Mir Mahmud Khan and Mir Din Muhammad, his nephew, are chiefs of . . this district with headquarters at different Dashtyan district. i - • -i • i j ji villages and the relationship between the two continues to be sprained. Din Muhammad, who is quite a young man, is headstrong and resents any interference from his uncle, the consequence being that reports come in from time to time of the intentions of the two chiefs to resort to arms, and it is said only the friendly interference of other chiefs has prevented this occurring. Din Muhammad is supposed to have been present with Bahram Khan when the latter attacked and looted Mand and rendered active assistance, but sufficient evidence has never been forthcoming to prove the charge. The chief himself indignantly denies ever having any connection with the affair and says he did all he could to prevent Bahram, even going to the extent of offering him a large sum of money to abandon the idea. Owing to the unrest following on the capture and deportation of Shahdullah and his followers, the two chiefs of this district take it in turn, every alternate month, to guarantee the safety of the bazaar and the lives and property of the British- Indian subjects residing there by keeping a small armed force permanently at Charbar. There is nothing of importance to report concerning this district, which is under the control of Sardar Ashraf and Bahu district. . , i tt - i Ahmad Khan. The exportation of slaves from the Mekran has practically ceased, no reports concerning the trade having been received during the past year. The general condition of the country at the time of writing is satisfactory and all the leading Sardars well disposed towards us. The date crop, owing to the unseasonable rains during the early summer 3 resulted in a partial failure but the grain harvest was exceptionally good—the best for the past many years.

In the beginning of April Mehdi Quli Kh^n, Salar Easoud, the son of ... ISardar Zaffar, Bakhtiari, (the Chief of the nncipa evens. Mujaliid fugitives and Amir Mufakh- kham's party) with about 500 followers wore defeated by the Russians and arrived at the Karkeh river from Pusht-i-Kuh. Their intention was to cross the river and reach Bakhtiari country through Dizful. A few days later two or three Squadrons of British Cavalry were established at Shush to ir.torcept them. Mepsages were despatched by Ilkhani and Sarem-ul-Mulk (Masoud's brother) to Salar Masoud through the Bakhtiari representatives at Dizful advising them to surrender to Officer Commanding at Shush but without result. Operations were commenced on 10th April against the fugitives and Sagwands, who also joined them, with the result that Salar Masoud with 100 followers were captured, some were drowned in their attempts to cross the river, and others fled to Pusht-i-Kuh. As a result of this action the bulk of the tribe deserted and Sadiq Kh&amp;n, Saiyid Muhammad Khan and Cheragh Ali Khan came over to Sartip Khan. A further attempt to cross the Karkeh w r as made by the fugitives but was frustrated by the Sagwands and, on the 18th, the Sagwands under Mizban Khan and Agha Beza attacked, dispersed and looted the remainder of them and 30 prisoners were taken. On the 21st April Shaikh Durchal bin Eaeel of Abdul Khan's tribe disarmed a band o£ 150 Bakhtiari fugitives under Bahadur-us-Sultaneh and handed them over to Captain Noel. On 26th May 200 more Mujahedins under Abul Kasim Khan, in flight from the Russians, reached the camp of Agha Eeza Sagwand with the intention of inakinsj for their homes via Dizful. On arrival of the Shush Squadron at Kushk Abul Kasim Khan's party made off up Diz. They were pursued and a good many horses and arms were captured. Many were reported to have been drowned while crossing the Diz. About the middle of May Salar Masoud and Bahadur-us-Sultaneh were released and handed over to Ilkhani at Ahwaz. Three hostages, Najaf Quli Khan, son of Sartip Khan, Ghazban, son of Kazem Khan and Ghulam Reza Khan, son of Darab Khan, sons of Sagwand Chiefs, were sent to Mohammerah on the 8th June for custody. They were accommodated by the Shaikh at Failiyeh and a monthly allowance of tomans 15 eaeh was paid to them by Government through the Consulate. About the middle of May, the notorious Mujahid, Saiyid Isa, was brought to Ahwaz by Shaikh Hanzal. He was later brought down to Mohammerah by the Shaikii and is living at the palace. In September Imad Daftar was sent to Mohammerah from Dizful as his conduct was very objectionable there. He is still at Mohammerah. Shaikh Qasim Ali of Zargan was also taken prisoner and sent to Basrah about the middle of September. Sardar Muhtasham and Amir Mujahid the Ilkhani and llbegi arrived at Band-i-Qir at the beginning of May and a few days later the Shaikh proceeded to Band-i-Qir and brought them to Ahwaz, where a gathering took place on the 23rd and 24th May. The Chief Political Officer, Shaikh Haji Rais, Junior Khans, Consular Officers, and Dr. Young were present at the meeting. Both eventually gave assurances to carry out their duties satisfactorily and to maintain good order in the district under their jurisdictions. Lieutenant-Colonel R. L. Kennion proceeded to Ahwaz on the 4th . , r . „ „ , January and, after visiting Dizful and Shush, His Britannic Maiesty a Consul s tours. . ii-n/ri i oiirti returned to Mohammeran on 3ra February. On the 16th February he visited the Shaikh at Idrisiyeh and returned to Mohammerah on 18th February. He proceeded again to Ahwaz on 80th March and returned on 26th April. On 15th May he made a third trip to Ahwaz and returned to his Headquarters on BOth May.

The ^Military Authorities at Basrah have provided this Consulate with a Native Infantry ^uai d ccnsisting of one Non-Commissioned Officer and 6 men. The guard is relieved every month by another detachment. The arrangement has worked satisfactoiily. The Department worked satisfactorily throughout the year in charge of Monsieur Van den Aheele. Monsieur Customs ■ Graux held charge of the Customs House at Ahwaz during the year. Messrs.

The Company's Stem Wheeler ' Amidyeh ' also carried excess parcels and mails to Ahwaz. A branch post office was opened at Abadan, in October, and the mails between Abadan and Mohammerah are conveyed by runners. The Sub-Postmaster at Abadan is also in charge of the Telegraph Office there. The telegraph line between Mohammerah, Ahwaz, Shushtar, D:zful and I3ehbehan was not in any way interfered ' el(gl ' ,lh3 ' with during the year.

The Company, in addition to the Admiralty work, undertook the re-erection of the India Office River Craft both at Abadan and Mohammerah. This was continued until the end of November when the Basrah xluthorities took charge of the work. Messrs. Lynch Brothers, Limited, continued their business. They brought out two launches from England in March and commenced a daily passenger service between Basrah and Mohammerah. The daily mails, which hitherto were run up to Basrah by Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Company, were taken over by Lynch Brothers in September. They have been carrying to and bringing down cargo from Ahwaz by means of Country Craft. Owing to the continued insecurity of the Bushire-Shiraz road the Bushire merchants continued sending their merchandise via Mohammerah and also exported their opium and gum by the same route. On the 16th January a fracas occurred at Abadan village between some Police at Abadan and Mohammerah.

Captain E. Noel held charge of the Vice-Consulate for the -nhole of the year under review. He was replaced as Personnel. Assistant Political Officer, Ahwaz, on his departure for tbe up country on June I7tli&gt; fiist by AXi, E. 13. Soane, till lOtli July and then by Captain Batters till 27th November, and by Captain Fowle for the rest of the year. Khan Sahib Mirza Muhammad Rahim continued as Head Mirza at Headquarters while his son, Mirza Muhammad, accompanied the Vice-Consul on tour. Mr. Nadir Shah was replaced as Head Clerk by Mr. Bagyanadhan on the 22nd of June Sub-Assistant Surgeon Atta Muhammad remained in charge of the dis pensary. The question of the provision of an Assistant to His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul who would reside permanently in Chahar Aiahal was raised at the close of the year. The Expeditionary Force in Mesopotamia started to draw heavily on Arabistan for supplies in the early part G0nera1- of the year. It soon became apparent that the satisfactory accumulation of supplies would entail a general tightening of our political control and a suppression of lawlessness and anarchy. The purchase of two thousand mules in Dizlul in January, February and March was continually being hampered by the vagaries of local notables and tribal Chiefs. Eventua 1 ly, in March, it became necessary to garrison Shush with two squadrons of cavalry. Punitive measures followed against the Sagwand tribesmen who had been resp msible for tbe looting of 400 Government mules on their way from Dizful to Amarah in January. In April a force of Bakhtiari tribesmen, who had been fighting against the Eussnms at Kermanshah, attempted to return to their own country from Pusht-i-Kuh via Dizful. The detachment at Shush moved out and broke up the rebel party as it was trying to cross the Karkeh at Pa-i-Pul. Those who had crossed were completely looted by Sag wands, while those remaining on the far side were forced by hunger to surrender a few days later to Shaikh Durchal's Arabs. They were marched into Naseri to the number of about 150, where they were all released with the excepiion of about 14 ^-gendarmes, who were sent to India as prisoners of war. In May another party of about 300, under the leadership of Abul Qasim Khan, the son of Zargham es S.iltaneli, attempted to come the same way. They succeeded in crossing the Karkeh but were intercepted by the detachment at Shush on the left bank of the Diz opposite the town. A few managed to swim across, but the river being in flood some 5S were drowmed and the re mainder who scattered were stripped by Sagwands. The beginning of the year saw the Bakhtiaris supreme at Shushtar and Shushtarand Dizful. Dizful. V\ aqar-ul Mulk, Nizam es Sultaneh's Deputy, could only remain on sufferance after an unsuccesstul trial of strength with the Bakhtiari Deputy Governor Arshad ed-JDow lea, a notorious intriguer. In February V^aqar gave up Dizful as a bad job and moved to Shushtar where, however, the Bakhtiari Deputy Governor, A jam Khaji, retained the real power. In May he lost heart and retired to Tehran During the winter the Allah Yar Khan section of Chahar Lang tribes devastated the whole Province. Repeated requests to the Ilkhani, fetponse ' SOme Counter mea sures met with no effectiveFOR THE YEAR 1916. 55 With the adrent of summer conditions the despatch of sheep to the Tigris line necessarily came to an end (7,287 sheep were sent from Arabistan to Amarah). Anarchy at Shushtar and Dizful was steadily on the increase and it became apparent that something would have to be done if it was intended to tap the district for supplies next winter. On July 2Sth Mr. E. B. Soane, who had been up to now Assistant Political Officer at Shush, moved across to Pizful and in a very short space of time assumed the complete administrative control of the town and the surrounding country. At Shushtar the Governor, Ain-ul-Mulk, who had been in office since July, found himself quite incapable of coping with the notables of the town. On December l^th Captain Edmonds moved up to Shushtar as Assistant Political Officer and succeeded in getting the local situation well in hand without much difficulty. The removal of the leading bad character, Bahir Khan, to Basrah contributed largely towards the introduction of a much healthier element into the local situation. The improvement in the general situation in North Arabistan was not, however, complete without some fighting taking place. The general results were that the leadership of the Sagwand tribe passed entirely into the hands of our nominee Sartip Khan. The Arab Shaikhs Haider Ghafil, Furaiyeh i Faisal and Haider Talayil who had looted Shaikh Farhan, were badly worsted, and their tribes given to Shaikhs Khuraibit, Finian Sabon and Fulayeh, respectively — At various' other times the following changes were made in the Shaikh- ship's of the tribes :— Shaikh Mackenzie vice his father Mushatat of the Surkheh. Shaikh Muzail vice Mola of the Chaab-i-T)ubais. Saiyid-el Ahmed vice Mouzan of the Chaab. Khazair vice Finian of the A1 Buwayir. At the beginning of the year the Khans had just arrived at Malamir accompanied by Dr Young Sardar Bakbtiari - Muhtasham, llkhani and Amir Mujahid Ilbegi were still friendly, but the first signs of dissension were already apparent. The question of the Bakhtiari agreement, which had been for some time simmering, now began to take definite shape. In the first week of February Mr Grabame, accompanied by Dr. Young, proceeded to Ramuz to enter into specific negotiations with the Khans. Eamuz, which had been sedulously cultivated by German agents, proved a hot-bed of anti -British feeling. Before the party had been there a week a popular commotion arose in the coarse of which Mr. Grahame and Dr. Young were mobbed. The ostensible cause of this movement was the arrest at Band-i-Qir of a Eamuzi caught distributing seditious literature to the men of our detachment. It was not found practicable to push on with the agreement as the political situation in the north was so unstable that the ruling Khans were strongly averse to taking any action which might not be ratified by their brothers in Tehran. Under these circumstances the matter was allowed to drop till the Khans in Tehran signed the agreement in May, when the llkhani and Ilbegi ratified the action of their brothers. From Bamuz the Khans left for Behbehan when they undertook desul tory military operations against the Kuhgelus, which eventually fizzled out over a personal scjuabble between the llkhani and the Ilbegi. The noto rious firebrand, Saiyid Isa, was, however, captured and after some haggling handed over; and was sent to Kuwait. In May the Khans met the Chief Political Officer ami the Shaikh of Mohammerah at Ahwaz. .A seeming recon ciliation was temporarily patched up between the llkhani and Ilbegi and an agreement was come to and signed in regard to the position at Diztul and Shushtar. The Khans agreed to recognise the authority of the Governor-General and we in return promised our good offices in the recovery of the pay foi their Sowars who were employed as road guards and police at both towns. It was alsog0 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT agreed that His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul should accompany the Kbans to the high country with the object of supporting them if their brother Khans proved fractious. Mr. Grrahame had already made over the control of Bakhtiari affairs to His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul, on his return to Ispahan ia April. Owing to a large robbery by Kuhgelus at Kaleh Medresseh, in May, which called for a long delay at Malamir, His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul and the ruling Khans did not reach Chahar Mahal till the miudle ot •July. position on arrival there was as folio vs;—The news of the Turkish invasion had just been received and had given a fresh lease of life to the German campaign which had its nucleus with the party under Kardoff, the German ' Charge d Affaires,' who was enjoying the hospitality of Zargham-es-Sultaneh at Paradumbeh. The Khans, although they had undertaken to turn out the Germans hy force of arms if necessary, would not come up to the scratch, as they did not like to tackle the fort at Paradumbeh without artillery. As the Turks advanced further into Persia, Amir Mujahid, Ilbegi, with a view to possible developments, determined to get the Germans away from Zargham, with whom he had an old standing enmity, and get them lodged with his own friends. His idea being that if the Turks got the upper hand, he would indirectly come in for a share of the kudos attaching to harbouring the Germans. He arranged this move with success and, by the beginning of August, Kardoff and his following were safely lodged with Amir Mujahid's sister, Bibi Miriam, at Surishjun. In the meanwhile, by playing on the bad feeling between Amir Mujahid and Sardars Zatfar and Muhtasham, the latter readily fel] in with the idea of raising a Bakhtiari force, ostensibly to turn out the Germans, but in reality to deal a blow at Alujahid. When the latter realised this, he hurriedly arranged that Kardoff and his party, who had by now been joined by a following of 300 or 400 Bakhtiaris under Salar Masoud, Bahadur-es-Sultaneh Salar Azam, should leave Surishjun for Deh Kurd. The loyalist force of about 800 sowars which had in the meanwhile collected at the bidding of Sardars Muhtasham and Zaffar, slowly advanced towards Mi Kurd, but it was obvious that the Khans were determined that no collision shjuld occur. The main object was, however, achieved as the German party, who had counted on using Chahar Mahal as a base from which to recruit a force preparatory to an advance on Ispahan, was forced to move into the Ispahan Province where they were attacked and broken up at Tirun, on September, 1st, hy a detachment of Cossacks from. Ispahan. There then, lemained the question of punishment of the Bakhtiari Khans who had assisted the enemy. Surishjun was the first estate chosen for confiscation. Amir Mujahid resorted to every possible expedient to prevent the confiscation of his sister s property taking place, but without success. The confiscation of other estates followed automatically. - trx I n ^ e ptember a certain Mirza Farukhi arrived w r ith a message from the m phian to attack Ispahan but avoid, if possible, coming into collision with the Bntish. ^ A deputation of the Khans, headed by Sardar Patch, asked His Brit an ic Majesty's Vice-Consul whether the British would be prepared 0 con sic er a Bakhtiari attack on Ispahan as a purely personal matter between the Prussians and the Bakhtiari. In October the feeling against Amir Mujahid came to a head and he rXstl His unpopularity was chiefly due to his ehi.sal to pay his share ot the Bakhtiari pensions to the minor Khans Owinff X LtfoT t 6 not possible'to take Ma^e rvi 0 fl r a rTV a n f» W i '? 1 ,,, 4 ', 11 when His Britannic 1 be! bin VeT; T 1 iTf , Tebran two candidates for the nomination of ^ g Quli Khan.

Llis modus operandi was 1o spread reports that Muhtasham was accepling large surns from the British to sell Bakhtiari interests. His intrigues were so far successful that, on His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul's return to Bakhtiari from Tehran, Muhtasham made up bis mind to resign. Amir Mujahid was assisted in his designs by the fact that members of the likbani family were genuinely afraid that British policy aimed at building up a position of ascendancy in the tribe for Muhtasham. His intrigue was eventually defeated by buying over Zaffar with an offer of a substantial bribe and a favourable consideration of nis claims to be the next Ilkhani. The Khans did not leave for the low country till after the close of the year 1916. In the summer the Kussians extended the organization of the Persian Cossack Brigade to Ispahan, This raised the question of our initiating some organization in Bakbtiari to act in co-operation with the Russians. Proposals were made for the raising of a levy of 100 Bakhtiari sowars and 200 footmen under British officers. These proposals were sanctioned by His Majesty's Government at the close of the year. Another question raised w^s that of an alternative alignment for the Lynch road through Bars and Lurdegan. The Persian Transport Company professed their readiness and eagerness to interest tlemselves in any scheme for the improvement of communications through the Bakhtiari country and detailed their engineer, Mr. Sotham, to accompany His Britannic Majesty's Vice- Consul over the proposed new alignment and frame estimates for the construc tion of a motor road. Proposals for the erection of a telegraph line from Ahwaz to Ispahan through Bakhtiari were made in December. The line was to be considered in two parts, Ispahan to Chahar Mahal, Chahar Mahal to Ahwaz. The chief arguments adduced in favour of these proposals are— (1) The provision of an alternative land line from the occupied terri tories to India. (2) The development of the Bakhtiari trade route. (3) The need of telegraphic communication in connection with the formations of the Bakhtiari Levy Corps. The possibilities of two irrigation projects, one at Chighakhur and the other at Malamir, w r ere discussed by His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul with the Khans, who seemed disposed to'find the necessary funds provided we could arrange for services of an engineer. Both schemes promise a good return on initial outlay. Before the war some 24 of the younger Khans had been to school in Europe and there were perhaps another fifty who could afford a European education. The project of founding a College run on European lines in Bakhtiari was suggested to the Khans, who welcomed the proposal and made suggestions for raising the necessary capital by hypothecating^ the revenue of the village of Margmalik, in which the majority of the Khans have an interest. Luring the year under review trade has laboured under the greatest disadvantages. The period during which Trade and Commerce, traffic was suspended on account of insecurity is well above the average ; transport rates have reached a figure hitherto unheard of; river transport has been conducted under extremely trying conditions and merchants have been faced with unprecedented diffi culties in the matter of finance. Up till Eebruary 6th the road was practically closed owing to German activities in Ispahan. Snow on the passes hindered forwarding, which was only in full sw T ing by the end of March. A big robbery by Kuhgelus at Kaleh Madresseh, in July, held up caravans for a time. From August 17th to September 21st the road was definitely closed owing to the political situation around Ispahan. Eor the greater part of the year the notorious robbers iteza Khan and Jaffer Quli, exacted a toll of T. 1 a mule between the58 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Baklitiari border and Ispahan. Owing to Ibe latter s depredations many thousands of packages of upward cargo were held up at Qahwarukh and w ere only released in October under escort furnished by Sir Percy Sykes from Ispahan. It w 7 as not till November that the Hussians were able to drive out these brigands and break up their following. On the 30th June, the Imperial Bank of Persia cancelled without notice their longstanding arrangements for financing the road transport, and stated its inability to buy exchange on London or Bombay. The Bank admitted it was in an overbought position owing to the hea\y demands of the military authorities for local purchase. Bates have been abnormally high.

The average upw 7 ard rate was krans as compared to krans 7'87 for 1915 and krans 7 for 1914. T\ hat with the low exchange value of sterling and the high transport rates, ten shillings a ton a mile was the rate in force on the road for the greater part of the year. The conditions on the road itself are as bad as ever. The road surface is bad and little repairs have been carried out. Lynch read. Caravanseraies are woefully insufficient; exorbitant rates for supplies of all kinds are in force. The Khans have recently increased the tolls from krans 5 to 8 per mule The supply of transport animals is sufficient, (1,750 tons of cargo were carried forward from 1916.1917). The Moin's steamer is the only one left which is available for transport services. British firms, however, prefer t iTer tai.spoi . ^ ma j, e uge sa i|i U o&gt; craft with all the inherent disadvantages of pilfering, slowness of transit and liability of goods to damage.

This factor, taken in combination with the disturbances in Ears and the closure of ail trade routes in that area, has resulted in a record year for the Bakhtiari road. It is estimated that about 7,000 tons of goods were forwarded during 1916 from Ahwaz to Ispahan. Messrs. Lynch's figures are— 1^10 ••#... 26,397 cwts.

Pour caravans were thus despatched, but as two of them were robbed the project was abandoned. The new KT pipe-line was completed to Wais in August 1916 This enabled , „ . . the throusrhput to be put up from S to 12 Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 0 Ti -o Ii i £ M. G. monthly. By the end 01 the year the line was practically complete and testing had commenced. On Maidan-i-Naphtun, at the close of 1916, five wells were allowed to flow and 30 are capped and with little further work can be produced as required. At the White Oil Springs the first test well was carried to 2,095' deep. In the spring of 1916 a second test well was started and by the end of the year had reached a depth of 1,508 feet. A slight show of 'White Oil was struck at 1,060 feet. Geological surveys were carried out in 1916 on the following areas :— («) Neighbourhood of Maidan-i-ISaphtun, extending from the Gulistan Hiver on the north-west to Gach Chusar on tiie south-east and from Daragendi Gorge on the north-east to the Labar Plain on the south-west, area examined 150—200 square miles. (6) The Derra Qil area and its neighbourhood and the north-western part of the Asmari Hill and along the Tembi River for six to ei2rht miles eastwards of the Asmari Hill. O (c) The Manyur-Misdakh Range for a distance of CO miles from the Karkeh River to the Do wain j. (d) Qilab oil shows. The question of a fresh water-supply for the fields is still under discus sion, but opinion is now in favour of the Karun being utilized from the north of the fields. There is little doubt that this scheme will be put through at an early date as the problem of a fresh water-supply for the fields is becoming acute. The alternative scheme was to tap the Gargar river at Darreh-Khazineh and carry the water pipe line up to the fields along the Company's Cart Road. An analysis of the water from this source gave satisfactory results. The Company have determined to use electric power for drilling and other work on the fields and for this purpose will lay down a Central power station at Tembeh. Dispensary.

The Medical Officer of the 95th and then of the 94th Infantry stationed at Bait-ul-Falaj officiated as Agency Surgeon in addition to his own duties. On the departure of the latter regiment the duties were undertaken by the Medical Officer of the 108th Infantry. An allowance of Es. 100 per mensem was sanctioned for the officer performing these duties. Sub-Assistant Surgeon J. P. Mascarenhas remained in charge of the Hos pital and performed his duties very efficiently. Monsieur A. Jeannier was Consul for France throughout the year. Abdul Aziz bin Euwahi continued as Dragoman. Monsieur Paul Constance, Petty Officer in charge of the French Coal Dep6t, was relieved, in September, by Petty Officer Matiudi. At the close of the year no less than 80 cases remained unsettled out of 140 which had been submitted to His Highness during the year. This was partly due no doubt, to the constant change of Political Agents ; but not the least cause of the discontent which exists regarding the adminis tration of Saiyid Taimur is due to the fact that complaints are not properly attended to, while his want of readiness in seeing such Shaikhs as come to visit him is a cognate cause of dissatisfaction, Saiyid Nadir, the Sultan's brother, takes a large part in the transaction of judicial work, as indeed also the general work of administration but he is reported to be venal. Since the close of the year His Highness has made commendable efforts to dispose of arrears himself and to improve matters, but the few advisers he has are not very wise and such advice as they give is not to his benefit. Administration of His Highness the Sultan.CA PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT His HigVmeFs' financial condition is referred to under the heading Customs, Since his necessary expenditure is equal to, ii not in excess of his income and he has other expenses, soine of which are avoidable, and ^ others, though not unavoidable, difficult to cut down in an Oriental State, his indebtedness can but continue to increase. Saiyid Taimur has inherited a throne in w hich his power extends only s0 far as the guns of British ships can reach, while he has perhaps inherited a character which, though it might with guidance do much in stttled conditions, can do little to cope with the difficulties with which he is surrounded. Cut off from the Arab tribes by a rebellion which was a force before lie came into his own, living in a capital of which the population consists mainly of ^British Subjects, Baluchis and Negroes and in which there are no leaders of Arab opinions, comparatively little in touch ^ith the luither poits wnich form a part of his dominions over which he has still some control, represented by Walis who are backward and corrupt, he has levV to whom he can turn for assistance. The conditions are such as could only be dealt with by a man of experience or great force of character and neither oi these qualities does the Sultan possess. On the other hand he gives promise of good judgment and is possessed of a sound common sense—when he is left to himself—-which with maturity should make him a better ruler than either his grandfather or his father, provided that he is left with something to rule. His Highness was represented at Gwadur by his brother Saiyid Salim who was, however, recalled in October owing to disturbances and complaints of the Hindu community in connection with a cow being killed and dragged through the streets of the bazaar bv his soldiery in the previous July. The family of the Sultan is a severe drag upon the finances of the state and, since very few of them are employed, or employable they do not assist much in the work. Saiyid Dhiab, the cousin and brother-in-law of His Highness left Maskat in October, and has resided in India ever since. It is presumed that, after being some years in England, he finds life in Maskat somewhat impossible. The Sultan does not appear to be very pleased with him. The system of Customs remains the same, but several changes took place ^ , in the management 2 successive natives of Customs, t t j -! • India taking over charge. The Superintendent of the previous year, Salim bin Abdullah al Khaimari, •left at the end of the previous year his service having been dispensed with. He was relieved by Saiyid Abu Salih, a native of Poona, the son of a former Subedar of the Indian Army, and related to several native officers. In November Saiyid Abu Salih was relieved by Muhammad Reimoo, a Khoja and British Subject of Gwadur, who also formed the customs at the latter port. The reason for the change in this instance is stated to have been due to the fact that Saiyid Abu Salih w r as unable to raise any further loans for His Highness Not the least of the reasons that a more satisfactory system of Customs control is not introduced by the Sultan is that, under present circumstances, he cannot draw upon the Customs Department for overdrafts as on a Bank, the system having been to obtain the money from Hindu and other traders as an advance against future Customs duties. As goods are imported the merchant pays half^ dues the other half being credited towards paying off the advances given, while 15 per cent, interest is charged on all such loans. The present Superintendent is attempting to put an end to this system and, when necessary, to borrow money in the open market at ordinary rates of interest. He calculates that if he pays present fixed salaries and stipends, which includes those of His Highness'family, it will take three years for him o pay o a L debts on the Customs which have been incurred as above stated, n T Calls are made u P 0n him - M however, the Sultan legards the Customs at a source of general income, it would be unprecedented1*1 FOE THE TEAR 1916. 65 if no further calls were made thus it would be optimistic to imagine that, on present lines, the state of the finances of the Stace will be in a more flourishing condition in three years' time than they are to-day. The subject of zikat, which has proved troublesome in previous years, was avoided this year by the Sultan's agreeing not to impose an extra tax of 10 per cent in addition to the noimal 5 per cent, on dates exported to the coast by _ his rebellious subjects of the interior. The question of zikat, lived In 1914, has not been terminated. The incidence fell upon the British Subjects ^ho exported rather than upon the' contumacious subjects whom His Highness desired to punish, and the matter still remains to be dealt with. In July a complaint was made against the Wali of Khaburah who, not for the first time was levying a 5 per cent, export tax and was refusing to grant a certificate for payments so made. At the end of the year a similar complaint was again received. The Political Agent was desirous of visiting the spot to make personal enquiries but, owing to the fact that he is dependent upon Naval vessels to reach any of the ports in which he may have work, the matter had to be left no vessel being available. It will not be out of place to mention the fact of the difficulty caused by no Launch being supplied to the Maskat Agency. The town of Muttrah is practically a suburb of Maskat, but it takes 45 minutes by rowing boat to visit that place and thus the best part of a day is taken up in any such visit. The previous year closed with the whole of the interior in the hands of the „ ' Imam and his Lieutenants, Isa bin Condition of country. o ti i tt* 'ii • i tt i • xt • 1 balin-el-liiritm ana Hamyar bin Masir-el Nebhani, Chief Shaikh of the el-Riami. Humours of attacks on the capital and on the ports, especially Barkah, were frequent throughout the year. A collection of men which was taking place at Nakhl, in October, under the ' Imam ' dispersed on the arrival of H. M. S. ' Britomart ' at Barkah. Fighting took place at Ja'alan where a party under the orders of Ali-bin- Salih, a brother of Isa bin Salih, the Chief rebel, attacked Ja'alan. The place was defended by the Beni Jabir who beat off the attack. There were rumours also in the latter part of the year of an attack on Rustaq, which had once surrendered to the ' Imam, ' but apparently had not been held. These rumours are culminating in a projected attack at the moment of writing after the close of the year. Bustaq is held by a branch of the Al Bu Saidi family and the present holder is a cousin of the Sultan; the rulers are practically independent and among the local Arabs receive the same form of address as His Highness, i.e., Saiyid. During the year there were various defections from the cause of His Highness. In April Nasir bin Humaidi Attabi visited the Sultan and received pre sents of money, rice and arms but, in June, he went over to the &lt;{ Imam '. In July he was followed by Muhammad bin Talib Al Harasi w T ho had been appointed Shaikh of Mazehi near Eustaq by the last Sultan. His defection caused a loss of 500 to 1,000 men to the Sultan. In September His Highness was annoyed to learn that the only fort which he held in Hhahirah had been surrendered by the garrison. At the end of the year His Highness' power extended only along the coast and practically as far as the guns of Briiish ships can carry. The Imam continued to confiscate any gardens or property owned by the Sultan's relatives in the interior or any that were owned by people serving His Highnes?. He states that as these are as bad Moslems as their master they are unfit to hold property under the Shara law. Continued reports were received that the rebel movement was losing ground but these are undoubtedly false. The whole of the interior acknow ledges the ' Imam ' who, backed by His Lieutenants, Isa bin Salih and Hamyar66 PERSIAN GTJLF ADMINISTRATION REPORT bin Nasir rules in complete authority and apparently with considerable attempt at justice. ■, The piquet line at Bait ul-Falaj to the west of Muttrab and at Sidab ^ ^ south of Maskat continued to be held by British Troops in Oman. troops of the Indian A^my. At the be^inninsj of the year the place was garrisoned by the 95th Eussell's Infantry, and one Wing of the 108th Infantry. On the 18th January 1916, the ^th ftussell's Infantry relieved the 95tli Russell's Infantry, the latter leaving for Nowshera on the 27Lh January 1916. The second Wing of the ICSrh Infantry arrived from Bombay on the 13th February. The regiment, however, supplied one detachment for Persia. On the 18th November the Q^th Russell's Infantry left for Tank leaving the 108th Infantry less one company in Persia to protect Muttrah and Maskat. The enemy made no definite movement against the troops but some shots were exchanged at Sidab with a party who attempted to stalk No. 1 Piquet on the night of the 29th March. There were no casualties on either side. His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, visited Maskat in his Flag Ship H.M.S. Naval. ' Euryalus ' on the 4ith April, the usual salute being given and returned. Most of the ships of the East India Squadron visted the port during the year. Afire broke out at the Naval Coal Dep6t on the 22 nd July. It was extinguished with the fire engine under the escort with the assistance of a boat's party from H.M.S. ' Philomel ' Amons the upper classes a certain pro-Turk sympathy exists and the movement of the Sharif of Mecca has Effect of the war. found little support in Maskat. His action has been condemned since it is argued that the Turks were the only Moslem power strong enough to be the political and religious centre for Muhammadanism and it is considered that the Sharif will never be powerful enough to stand alone but will need to depend upon the support of Christian powers. There is thus a Pan-Islamic feeling which results in an anti-European under-current. On the other hand one Ibrahim Adhan was deported from Maskat by the Sultan for speaking against the Sharif of Mecca. The victory at Baghdad impressed the public with the power of the British and indeed they already look upon the annexation of Oman in the fullness of time as a matter of course. Reliable reports were received of a steady stream of arms in small packets which were carried to the Mekran coast Arms Traffic. i n dhows which trade between Oman and Mekran, News of the smuggling of arms in quantities exceeding ICO were rarely obtained, the only definite cases being two amounts of 300 each in December and one of 100 rifles in j uly. One of the former cases of 800 rifles was confirmed from Jask. Rifles now exported are mainly of Martini or older makes but it is to he suspected that magagine rifles are exported from Barka and the ports of the Batinah coast. His Majesty's ships being otherwise engaged have been unable to take up this question. Ammunition is more scarce than are rifles and it is stated that to purchase any number of rounds it is necessary to consent to buy a rifle as well. The import of arms has ceased only one case being reported. This case is referred to above as consisting of the 300 rifles which wire re -exported to J ask and their arrival confirmed from that place. The rifles were brought to bur from Djibouti and thence taken via Barka to the Mekran coast.^ 1. BP ■3) FOR THE TEAR 1916. 67 Such arms then as are obtained are from stock which still exist in the country The Arms Warehouse has worked satisfactorily. Tl*e Superintendent, Abdul* Eahman, died in September. A temporary Superintendent was appointed in the person of Muhammad Ibrahim, an Indian, and the financial Secretary to His Highness. Saivid Abu Salih, the displaced Customs Superintendent, was appointed Superintendent of the Arms Warehouse, in December 19] 6, and appears to be a satisfactory man but his work is a sinecure. Trade has gone from bad to worse during the year as shown by the follow- Trade. tableS Imports. Exports. £ £ 1913-14 407,728 271,537 1914-15 327,612 274,939 1915-16 242,994 188,121 K 2 It is anticipated that a bigger fall will be shown in 1916-17. No business is beino&gt; done in the town and the leading member of the Hindu community informed the Political Agent that many of the traders would leave Oman if they had not so many outstandings which they could not recover during the present disturbed state of the country. It is worthy to note that these occur m the country under the rule of the Sultan, The ' Imam ' causes all debts to be paid. Dates, pomegranates and other fruits form the staple export of the interior. The custom has always been for the traders in the ports to visit the interior or to send his Agent to make local purchases on the spot. It is now, however, impossible for any British Subject to visit the interior and it is equally impossible for the owners of property to visit the ooast towns. It has thus been found necessary to make as Agents for both parties the owner of the caravans who are allowed to pass freely from the interior to the coast and vice-versa. This safe conduct is a necessity to both sides since unless the dates, etc., reached the coast, the grower would have no market for the produce; while the Sultan agrees to the plan since it allows him to collect ins 5 per cent, duty without which his reduced revenues would be still tuitiier attenuated. The caravan owner is, however, often not only unreliable but also illiterate and thus proves an unsatisfactory Agent. Profits are accordingly reduced and trade suffers. The once prosperous town of Maskat first dependent for its prospeiity on the Navy and merchant service which made the ^ Sultan of Maskat an overlord of fame throughout the East and which, later, maintained some measure of its ancient prosperity by means of the arms traffic, is now steadily dwind mg. Empty houses and ruins mark its decay; day by day the signs of its decadence increase and presumably will continue to do so more and more until such time as trade with the interior becomes possible again, though it will never achieve its earlier importance as a trade centre for distribution to Persia and Mesopo tamia. Landing arrangements were not satisfactory and traders had difficulty in receiving claims. Saiyid Yusuf-al-Zawawi remained in charge of the wor which was, however, at the end of the year, transferred to the Customs Depart ment a much more satisfactory arrangement, since it left the control o goo s in one hand from the time of leaving the ship's side till handed over to the merchant. Eormerly any merchant demanding compensation o 0( ^ s 08 01 1 broken found himself engaged as a shuttlecock in a game of battledore and shuttlecock between the Landing Agents, the Customs and the Shipping, gen s. 21. Slaves were freed during the year Slave Trade - under report.68 PERSIAN GULP ADMINISTRATION REPORT It is stated that there is on the Batinah coast a certain amount of traffic in slaves with Mekran, a matter which is receiving due attention. The French Consul, Monsieur Jeanmer, has now been in Maskat for 7 years. His health is suffering in con. ' Frdnch Interest9 - sequence and he is constantly iil fever and rheumatism while his nerves are going to pieces. He rarely leaves his house thus, though relations are cordial, a meeting necessitates a visit to him and he hardly mixes in the European life of the place. Abdul Aziz, the Prench Dragoman, notorious in the past for his anti -British conduct, once previously expressed a desire to enter British service. A sound ing of the present incumbent on the same subject can only have emanated from him. It is to be suspected that Abdul Aziz is in touch with the rebel tribes of the interior. There is only one French subject in Maskat, an Algerian convert to Muhammadanism from Judaism and a nephew of Monsieur Gugoyer, one Ibrahim Elbaz Gugoyer. The French Torpedo Boats ' Lefronde' and ' Perecote' arrived from Bom bay and left for Aden on the 22nd February. Instructions were received, in December, that the French Government had agreed to lend to His Majesty's Government the French Coal and Oil Dep6t and sheds at Mokalla for the purpose of enabling fuel oil to be stored for ships proceeding to Basrah but, up to the end of the year, the French Counsul had not received his official instructions to hand over the Dep6t. (Ihese were received later and the Depot was duly taken over.) The list of Oman dhows entitled to fly the French flag showed 12 vessels enjoying that privilege. There is a remarkable divergence of opinion in previous reports on the Health. health of Maskat due no doubt to the variation in different years. Prevalence of malarial fevers is, however, shown by the medical returns of the various regiments which have been stationed at Bait-ul-Falaj. The highest number of men admitted into hospital from all diseases in one month was, in 1915, in the month of February 365 men out of a strength of 96b while in 1916 it fell to 13o men out of 901 in the month of June. In ]91 t ), 1,459 cases of malaria occurred a number which was reduced to 380 in 1916. The prevailing illnesses where malaria, diarrhoea and hoils, the malarial months being from December to April. Out of a detachment of men working on a piquet, in August 25 got sun stroke, 3 cases being fatal. 0 0 There were no epidemics during the year. A useful icport on the general health of the place is to be found in an article written by Major C. Gill, I.M.S, Medical Officer of the 95th Russells Infantry entitled ' Malaria in Maskat ' and published in July 1916 by the Indian Journal of Medical Eesearch. The Reverend F. J.

He Perbom.ei. has great influence over the Shaikhs. The year happily passed uneventfully GeiieraL on the Trucial Coast and there is little to records The pearl market improved and the 1916 pearl catch was quite up to the average and perhaps rather above it. The absence of mail and other steamers was a hardship : arrangements, however, were made to send mails to and from Henjam by dhow. Trade with India has to a great extent been carried on by sailing vessels. Nothing worthy of note occurred in Ras-el-Khaimah. RaS -el-Khaimah. The Shaikh of this principality continued to give trouble by intriguing with various feudatories of the Qawasim Umm-ui-Qaiwam. Shaikhs. He had to be warned to dis continue his intrigues on more than one occasion. The year passed uneventfully in A ^ man ' Ajman. The only event of importance in Shargah was the revolt of the Headman of Hamriyeh from the authority of the Shargah ' Shaikh of Shargah. This occurred in March and was due to the intrigues to the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain referred to above. The Shaikh of Shargah collected a force to suppress Hamriyeh, but was unable to do it, because the latter was assisted by the Shaikh of IJmm-ul-Qai- wain and by Bedouin egged on by the latter. The hostilities thus prolonged and the trade of both towns was damaged and, eventually, the lives and property of British subjects at Shargah became endangered. It accordingly became necessary to intervene and the Commodore, Persian Gulf, was accordingly asked to makfi arrangements. He despatched H. M. S. ' Philomel and H. M. S. ' Clio ' to the scene, and after some preliminary negotiations, the Shaikh of Shargah and the Headman of Hamriyeh repaired on board H. M, S. ' Clio,' on the 30th March, and made peace signing an agreement before Captain Hall Thompson, R. N., and the Residency Agent. The Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain made some efforts to upset this agree ment and have a new one made through his intervention, but without success. The only matters which caused correspondence were the establishment of a dhow mail service with Henjam (refer- Beha{ - red to above), and the everlasting question of the t( Hamal Bashi the individual who receives cargo from the steamers and takes charge of it on the wharf and distributes it. A temporary working arrangement has been arrived at, but the question will have to be dealt with finally when the war is over and a regular steam service is resumed. In December 1915, the Shaikh's watchman fired a shot across the bows of a dhow leaving the creek by night contrary to the Shaikh's orders, and accidentally hit and killed one of the crew, a native of Charak near Lingah. Considerable correspondence ensued, the Shaikh of Charak at first insisting that the offending watchman should be handed over to the relatives of the deceased boatman for punishment. As the watchman was only doing his duty70 PERSIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION KEPOET this could not be accepted, but eventually the Shaikh of Charak and the relatives of the deceased agreed to accept $800 as blood-rr.onejj and the case Mas settled in this way.

Climate.74 PEESTAN GULr ADMINISTRATION REPORT chapter xl ADMINISTRATION KEPOKT EOR THE KUWAIT AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1916. Tliere has been a remarkable growth in the prosperity of Kuwait in the year under review. This is in the main General due to expansion of trade with the interior and also to some extent to an excellent pearling season of which more anon. The shipbuilding industry 5 also, has been lively owing to the demand for lighters and other cratfc on the Siiatt-ol-Aiab. All classes appear to have shared in the general improvement, especially craftsmen, sailors and labourers. Building operations are in evidence in all quarters of the town, which is rapidly extending.' The exigencies of the war have compelled the British India Steam Navigation Company latterly to curtail their services to the port, In the first half of 1916 a monthly average of four of the Company's steamers was maintained, but since then the average has dropped to one a month. However, the Arab and Persian steamship lines have been making up for this deficiency to some extent by more frequent calls, and all steamers are now bringing heavier cargoes than formerly. The climate was equable ; the maximum, highest temperature recorded was 109°, on July 15th, and the lowest 40°, in January. The rainfall was 5 inches and 90 cents. The installation of the water condensing plant was still far from comple tion at the end of the year. Tlie pre- Watei Supply. occupation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in war-work may have contributed to the delay, as also the great difficulty in obtaining material from England. It is hoped, however, that the plant will be in working order by the middle of May, 1917. Until then, all water required must be brought from the Shatt-el-Arab, some 70 or 80 miles distant. The generally pro-British attitude of the Shaikh and people of Kuwait TheWai . was maintained throughout the year, Some little irritation, arising from the restrictions of our blockade, was perhaps natural in a community composed chiefly of traders, large and small. Moreover, prices obtainable in Hail and Syria were singularly attractive and, though aware that the very existence of his business depended on the British connection, it w^as exasperating to the trader to have to forego such a golden harvest. Shaikh Jabir al Mubarak, though our very good friend, was not the robust ally that his father had proved him self to be. He had only recently succeeded to the Shaikhdom and was anxious to be a popular ruler. The blockade was unpopular and Jabir gave us little or no real assistance in making it effective. Still, the failure of the operations to relieve Kut in the earlier part of the year and the eventual fall of that place did not affect Kuwait, as it would have done had there existed any under current of serious antagonism towards us. And after Bin Saud's visit, in Nov ember, and the epoch-making meetings which then took place between him and the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Alohammerah with the Chief Political Officer, it seemed as if the pro-Turkish party were definitely discredited. Literature on t e ^ar, especialjy Renter s telegrams, the Basrah Times, the Mukattam and 0 n . e ^P a P ers were in demand. The atrocities of the Germans and particularly their ill-treatment of the Belgians have made a deep impression. The massacre ot the Armenians is also frequently quoted against the Turks, who are perhaps more odious to the Arabs than to ourselves. An overland telegraph line has been^ constructed between Basrah and Posts and Telegraphs. Kuwait, via Zobeir, Um Kasr and Sabi' yah, a route which, though considerablyEOU THE YEAR 1916. 75 longer tban the direct road, lias the advantages of being near the sea and away from the area of tribal disturbances. There are, also, wells of fairly good water at frequent stasres, enabling repair parties and line inspectors to move with greater ease along the line. The Kuwait Telegraph Office was opened for Government business on 4th December 1916, and has since been opened to the public who are making corsiderable use of it. The people are now eagerly anticipating a railway to Basrah, and that would undoubtedly ensure the future cf the town and place it beyond the rivalry of all other ports on the Persian Gulf trading with the interior of the peninsula. The Post Office has been doing a large and increasing business in money orders, remitting thus over 4^ lakhs of rupees in the last quarter of 1916. This demand for money orders is due to the difficulty of remitting specie by steamers, as formerly, and to the fact that there has been a dearth of drafts on Bombay. Out-patients only are treated in the Charitable Dispensary. The prevail- in £: diseases were those of the eye and Public Health. j- x- ± digestive systems. 98 vaccinations were performed. There were 87 cases of malaria ; the small total due no doubt to the scarcity of water and extreme dryness of the climate. Cases mostly occurred among arrivals from Basrah and Bahrain. The quarantine arrangements are worked in conjunction with the Shaikh. 30 ships called at the port, one only being in quarantine with a case of small-pox. One case of bubonic plague occurred in town early during the year which recovered. When a ship is in quarantine, the passengers to be landed are placed in boats near the Customs House, as there is no proper quarantine ground. No epidemics occurred during the year. The number of out-door patients treated was 2,823 as compared with 2,831 in 1915. The attendance of sick in the dispensary has been steadily declining on account of the competition of the American hospital and dispensary. Eye diseases are probably spread by filth and the presence of flies which infest the town during six months in the year. Tuberculosis is common among children and the mortality high : parents do not as a rule avail them selves of medical aid, except in cases of injury or accidents. There is no idea of systematic conservancy. _ Those who live near the sea-shore use it for the purposes of nature, the inhabitants of the outskirts use the open desert and those of the central quarters their house-tops, or pits dug on the roadside. Here, refuse matter is allowed to collect and rot, until sufficiently dry to be removed for building w T alls and making bricks. Only the extreme dryness of the climate and scarcity of water would seem to prevent the natural consequences on the health of the people of such an entire absence of sanitary arrangements. All drinking water is brought by sailing boat from the Shatt-el-Arab some 70 or 80 miles distant. The rate of exchange varied considerably during the year with a gradual appreciation of the dollar and lira. The Exchauge, rates in December 1916, were:— Es. A. P. Maria Therpse dollars at . . . . • 152 0 0 per 100. Turkish Liras 1515 0 P er hra. English sovereigns „ • • • • . 16 12 6 per £. The relations of the Mission with Shaikh Jabir were quite satisfactory and might be summed up in the phrase MiBBion of the Reformed Church of America. 'benevolent neutrality.' The Shaikh himself was under the missionary physician's care during the month of L 276 PERSIAN GTJLl? ADMINISTRATION REPORT November and part of December. He called at the Mission House on several occasions, the last time being on November 21st, when he brought Bin Saud and the Shaikh of Mohammerah out to see the mission buildings and equipment That the hospital is appreciated by at least some of the Shaikh's family is evidenced by the fact that one of the Shaikhs was an in-patient on two occasions during the year. One hundred and twenty visits of a professional nature were made to well- to-do families, while with reference to the dispensary, as is true all over the world, most of the patients were from middle nnd poorer classes. The popularity of the medical work as a whole is undoubtedly growing. The school has attracted people of the middle class chiefly, a workin® knowledge of English being the main attraction. The total number of pupifs enrolled was 39 of which 80 were Moslems. The number of boats proceeding to the pearl banks was 500. The catch Tbe oearl fsberv WaS ^ UnUSUalI y g 00l J the mid- season prices favourable. The Bombay pearl market, however, fell towards the close of the season and, up to date h large amount of pearls are still being held in hopes of a rise. One result of this state of affairs is the dearth of drafts referred to above and another is an intense desire on the part of the pearlers for peace, which they imagine will at once restore the pearl market. Political events of far-reaching importance to the future of Arabia, in Arab affaiig which Kuwait played a prominent part, occurred in the latter half of 1916. The rebellion of the Sharif and cap lure by him of Mecca, in July, opened the eyes of the Arab world to the realization of the long-wished-for independ ence of their nation Henceforward, the idea of an independent Arabia under provincial rulers, looking to Great Britian for guidance and preservation from foreign interference, began to gain ground among the more thought ful of the Arabs and became at the same time the avowed aim of ^our diplomacy. Owing to rivalries and age-long feuds among the tribes, it was difficult to secure unanimity or any sort of cohesion among them, but the Shaikhs of Kuwait, whose interests, chiefly commercial, have always consti tuted them the peace-makers of this part of the Peninsula, lent themselves readily to the furtherance ot this policy. It seemed quite appropriate, there- foi^e, that Knvait should take its olace as the meeting-ground of the leading Princes of ^ioith-East Arabia, assembled to proclaim their sympathy with the cause of the fehaiif and their adhesion to Oreat Britain and the Allies. ^ possible to give a short and concise account of recent political moves as they affected, and were affected by Kuwait and vet, on the other hand, a Kuwait Administration Report for the year 1916 ' which omitted to give a comprehensive account of them, would be incomplete.

The British Government has no reason to believe that he entertained any hostile intentions against the tribes and territories of Najd. In the negotiation over the tieaty, in December 1915, Sir Percy Cox had discussed with Ibn Saud the possibility of his giving us assistance against Ibn Rashid The Hakim of jSajd then thought that Ibn Rash id would either come in or maintain a strict neutrality. If, however, he showed himself actively hostile, Ibn Saud wou'd attack him and incite the northern 'Anazah against him. This intention, however, he failed to carry out. During the spring and summer of 1916 he was occupied with a rebellion of the Murrah, following on, and perhaps connected with, that of the Ajman, which endangered his communications with the Hassa. Though a large proportion of the fighting men of the Sbammar had gone north with Ibn Rashid against the Iraq, no effective attack was made onlJailm their absence. In late June or early July, Ibn Saud's son, Tarki, raided Jabal Shammar, and the news may have hastened Ibn Rashid's retreat from our frontiers. In September or October Turki renewed hortilities against some of the Shammar Shaikhs and an allied section of the Harb, but the affair resulted only in the capture of a small amount of booty, and Ibn Saud's doctor, passing through Bahrain, brought a message to the effect that the Amir could do nothing against the Shammar as long as the fugitive Ajman remained on his flank. The true reason for his inactivity was no doubt his ow n insecurity at home, but the implacable hostility which he entertained towards the Ajman, whom he re garded not only as rebels but as the murderers of his brother Saud, threatened to become a problem of some difficulty. When Shaikh Mubarak died, in December 1915, Ibn Saud pressed his son and successor in Kuwait, Jabir, to drive out the Ajman Shaikhs. Jabir made a temperate repiy. He was unwilling to eject the Aiman, fearing that they wculd be thrown into the enemy camp; but he could not hold out against Ibn Saud's insistance without creating an open breach and he expelled the tribe in February 1916. As he anticipated, they turned for protection first to Ajaim and then to Ibn Rashid, but in May they asked and obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly near Saf wan and, subsequently, several of the leading Shaikhs made submission to us W hen Xbn Rashid turned to Hail only two of tlie Ajman Shaikhs remained with Ajaimi and they had little or no following. Ibn Saud's ardent desire'to direct his energies upon the extermination of this tribe was net one with which we had any sympathy, at all events at ihe present juncture. Shaikh Jabir, new r to his office, could not hope to exercise the influence over Ibn Saud which had been possessed by that practised and weighty dip* lomatist his father : moreover, for some years before A! ubarak s death, lelations between Riyadh and Kuwait had been growing cooler. Ibn baud bitteily resented Mubarak's attitude during the negotiations betw T eea himself and the Ottoman Government in the spring of 1914. According to his account the Shaikh had at first counselled him to accept the Turkish olfeis, but when he reached Kuwait, in April, Mubarak changed his note, w T ithout explanation, and advised Ibn Saud not to come to terms with the Turks, refusing at the same time to be present at his meeting with the delegates. So indignant w T as the Amir that he expressly stipulated with Captain Shakespear that Mubarak should not be consulted in the negotiations W'th ourselves. ihe asylum given to the Aiman was another grievanee, and in 1916 Ibn Saud complained of the incidence of the transit dues w hich Arab Fureau, 8th April 1916. from time immemorial, levied in Kuwait. While Ibn Saud's anxiety as to the ambitions of the Sharif and his growing estrangement with Kuwait showed that the chiefs allied with ourselves bad not reached a satisfactory understanding w ith each other, there was evidence that the Turks w ere still active in Arabia. News was received from Ibn Saud and fioni other sou ices of the despatch of an Agent (Muhammad) Taufiq Ibn Faraun of78 PEESIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION REPORT Damascus, for the purpose of buying camels for the Ottoman Governnnent. The emissary was well chosen, for he was a personal friend of Ibn Sand and had visited ISajd on the same business the previous year, Eut on this occasion the Amir was pressed by us to prevent him from obtaining camels : he accordingly arrested Ibn Taraun, confiscated 700 Arab Bureau, 19th September 1916. . which liad been purchased in the interior and sent them to Kuwait. Various reports^ some of which came from Ibn Saud, indicated that another attemnt Arab Bureau, herewith enclosed. , ~ ' l ^ ' to stir up Ibn Kasina against us was ia the wind. Eushaid Ibn Lailah, Ibn Eashid's representative at Constantinople, joined him at Hail with a few German and Turkish officers, a small body of Turkish soldiers and some guns ; accounts •varied as to the exact composition of the mission, but its presence in Hail in some form seemed fairly certain. Ibn Saud had written, in September, that he would be ii^lad of a personal interview with the Chief Political Officer to discuss the question of co-operation with the Sharif or offensive action against Ibn Eashid. In October he repeated the request urgently and on all grounds it seemed advisable to accede to it. Sir Percy Cox met him at Ojair on November II th. Ibn Saud explained to him his position in detail. He had lost considerably, in men and material,in the fight T\ithlbn Eashid in January 1915. Since then he had been almost continuously in the field, fiist against the Ajman and then again the IViurrah. Most of the normal tiade of Najd was with Syria, and the tribes were accustomed to sell their camels to Damascene dealers : the strict blockade imposed by Ibn Saud—the seizure of Ibn Paraun's camels bore witness to its reality—grew more and more galling : the Kajdis grumbled, the tiibes were restless, all asked wherein lay the advantage to themselves of their Chief's attitude, and it w T as increasingly difficult for him to keep them in hand. With regard to the Sharif, Sir Percy Cox was able to give Ibn Saud the fullest assurance. Our treaty with the Amir had been communicated to Mecca, and when the Sharif announced to us his intention of proclaiming himself King of the Ara bs, on No member 5th, we had insisted on a formal admission that he claimed no jurisdiction over independent rulers. The news of the coronation at Mecca had nofc yet reached Central Arabia and was not discussed. During conversation \^ith the Chief Political Officer at Basrah Ibn Saud made a passing remark about the Sharif's calling himself ' Sultan but his mind seemed to be set completely at rest on hearing that his rights were safeguarded by us and that the Sharif had explicitly denied any design on the independence of himself or his compeers. Ibn Saud having expressed to the Chief Political Officer, at their meeting at Ojair, his inclination to pay a brief visit to Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait before returning home, the project was cordially encouraged as appearing eminently expedient and bir 1 ercy Cox recommended that he should be presented with the K.C.I E. at a majlis which was to be held at Kuwait where the Shaikh was to be invested with the C. S. I. When he intimated to Ibn Saud that this honour was to be accorded to him, the Chief Political Officer was authorised to inloim hirn at the same time that his rights had been carefully reserved m all dealings which the British Government had held with the Sharif, anc Ibn baud m his reply said that he w r as entirely satisfied on this point.

He quoted as an example of our benevolent policy towards the Arab cause the fact that we were ready even to promote a reconciliation between himself and Ibn Uashid if the latter would abandon his attitude of hostility. The arrival of Ibn Earaun's 700 fine camels, each branded with the wasm of that well- known dealer, gave a dramatic completeness to the Kuwait gathering. From Kuwait Ibn Saud went to Mohammerah as the guest of Shaikh Khaza who co-operated most heartily in the endeavour to make Ibn Saud's visit profitable to him. The two chiefs arrived at Basrah on the evening of November 26th. Early next morning the Chief Political Officer, accompanied by two chief military representatives of the Army Commander present in Basrah, went on board the Shaikh's launch and presented Ibn Saud wdth a sword of honour and a message of welcome from the Army Commander. The day was spent in exhibiting to him the Ease Camps and organisation and the latest machinery of warfare including the aircraft in which he took an eager interest. Dhari ibn Twalah and Humud al Suwait, Shaikhs of the Sharnmar Aslam and the Dhafir, were present, wdiile Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair and several Sunni notables of Basrah and refugees from Baghdad had an audience with Ibn Saud on the launch. The Kuwait Durbar and Ibn Saud's visit to Basrah have placed us in a singularly strong position. Three powerful chiefs have made public protestation of their friendship with each other and their confidence in the British Govern ment. A telegram received from the Sharif, congratulating them upon their zeal in the Arab cause and regretting that he had not had time to send a representative to Kuwait, confirmed the identity of his aims with their own, and in a further message he apologized for any deficiences in his previous letters, on the ground that while he was in the throes of war he might unintentionally fall short as a correspondent. The dream of Arab unity which engaged the imagination of the Liberals of Damascus during the year before the war, has been brought nearer fulfilment than dreams are wont to come, but the i6le of presiding genius has been recast. Instead of the brilliant, unscrupulous Saiyid Talib, gyrating in the blast of his own ambition, the chiefs of Eastern and Western Arabia have united at the instance of the British Government. Besides this knitting together of Arab leaders, the meeting at Kuwait has produced certain immediate results. In the first place the extent and nature of Ibn Saud's share in future hostilities with Ibn llashid, if such should occur, was agreed upon. He undertook to maintain 4,000 men under arms : if Ibn Rashid moved in force towards the Iraq he would move up parallel with him towards Zubair and join the friendly tribes and a contingent from Kuwait. He informed the friendly Shaikhs that he would support them if Ibn Kashid threatened to attack them in strength. If, however, Ibn Rashid should remain at Hail, Ibn Saud would harass and attack him as opportunity offered, using the Qasim as a base. In view of the strain upon his resources during the last two years, he has been given 3,000' rifles with ammunition, as well as four machine guns, and granted a monthly subsidy of £3,000 to cover the expenses he will incur in maintaining his men in the field. Active co operation with the Sharif was not considered practicable, but Ibn Saud was ready to send one of his sons with some 40 men to Mecca as a sign of good will if the Sharif would make a special request for them. Secondly, a letter was written by Ibn Saud, in the name of the three chiefs, to Ajaimi ibn Sadun urging upon him the Arab Bureau, herewith enclosed. harm which he was doing to the Arab cause by his present attitude, inviting him to enter into communication with them and promising him friendly consideration and an opportunity for honour able submission.80 PEESIAN GULF ADMINISTRATION KEPORT Finally, with tho co-operation of Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait and the diplo. matic skill of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, who was throughout of the highest service to the Chief Political Officer, the delicate problem raised by the presence of the Ajman among the friendly tribes reached a satisfactory solution. For the period of the war a truce between Cbn Saud and the Ajman was agreed upon and instructions were drafted defining the position of the fugitive Shaikhs with respect to all tribes under our pro- Arab Bureau, herewith enclosed. tection. On his return to Basrah, Sir Percy Cox called in the Ajman leaders. They had been profoundly disquieted by the advent of Ibn Saud thinking that it augured ill for themselves, but the principal and more courageous headmen met the Chief Political Officer at Zubair and accepted the proposed terms, in return for which they were promised a monthly allowance similar to that received by the other friendly Shaikhs of the Shamiyah. They evinced little doubt that the remaining headmen of the Ajman, including the two who were still w 7 ith Ajaimi, would come in as soon as they heard of the happy issue of their own venture. Letters have been written to Pahad Beg ibn Hadhdhal informing him of the Kuwait meeting and inviting him to join the league of Arab Chiefs in expelling the Turks. These have been sent through a man from Pahad Beg's tents who was in Basrah at the time of Ibn Saud's visit and went to see him at Mohammerah, where he received advice and instruction from Shaikh Khazal in full measure. He was entrusted also with letters from the Sharif which have been waiting opportunity of despatch to Pahad Beg, Hachim al Muhaid Ali Sulaiman of the Dulaim and others, and with presents in money to guide Pahad Beg's decision and to encourage the amicable disposition of the Shaikh of the Dahomshah, Jaza ibn Mijlad.

(Seal) Abdul Aziz ibn Abdur Rahman al Faisal. Dated the 25th Muharram 1335. Translation of set of instructions to be communicated to and imposed upon the D ha fir, Shammar and Ajman. With the consent and. approval of Ibn Saud and the Shaikhs of Kuwait, November 1916. 1. That until the end of this universal war it is incumbent on the tribes which are in friendly relations with the Bri f ish Government to sink their inter tribal differences and enter into an agreement with one another in order to co-operate with the British Government. On these conditions the Dhafir tribe, and those of Ibn Tawala, and the Ajman tribe, should adopt a united attitude and should abandon differences existing between them with a view to earning the satisfaction of the British Government. 2. The Ajman are not to raid the inhabitants of al Aarid, either townsmen or nomads, and similarly the people of Aarid are not to raid the Ajman. 3. The Ajman shall not raid the Arabs dwelling in the Nigrah {i.e., from Kuwait to al Hassa) with the exception of the tribe of Umtair nor shall the said tribes raid them (the Ajman). 4.

So long as the above terms run into force and the Ajtnan adhere to them and remain obedient to the British Government the Amir Abdul Aziz bin Sand will not molest them, and they can rest immune so long as the Government are satisfied with them Purport of Chief Political Officer's remarks when delivering decorations. I feel greatly favoured by fortune at having the honour on behalf of His Majesty the King-Emperor and His Excellency the Viceroy, to invest Your Excellency Shaikh Jabir with the Companionship of the Star of India and Your Excellency Ibn Saud with that of the Knighthood of the Indian Empire. I have been commanded when delivering to each of you these decorations in their behalf to express to you at the same time the appreciation of His Majesty's Government of the co-operation and accord which we have received from your Honours since the beginning of the war. It is a great satisfaction to His Majesty's Government to know from me that you Shaikh Jabir have the firm intention of following in the wise footsteps of your distinguished father whose statesmanship and length of view made him famous among the Chiefs of the Arab States while as regards your Honour, al Amir, it has been a matter of much gratification to them to know that the relations between Your Excellency's family have been confirmed and cemented. It is my good fortune to find our tried friend Shaikh Khazal here at Kuwait, than whom no one has deserved better of the British Government, and it is a source of great satisfaction to be able to feel that ac this time we are all bent on one common purpose, to which we are quite confident of a successful issue.

On January 1st, J9K), Persian Gulf Squadron under Conuiiodore D St. A. Wake C. B. consisted of 'Juuo/' '* Philomel/' ' Pyramus/' 'Lawreuce/' ' Dalhousie/' 'Bramble/' 'Brit raiirt/' f ' .Muzaffrr' and armed launch 'Azerbaijan.' The distribution was, speaking generally, to have half the squadron in the north with Bushire as Headquarters, the other half being stationed in the south with Maskat as Headquarters. ' 1 hilomel ^ worked as Senior Otiicer of the southern port ion acting uiwier the orders of the Commodore, but with practically a free hand. ' Juno ' with Commodore on board remained north. 1 here was a certain amount of unrest round Bus hire at the beginning of the year. An attack by the hostile tribe was pos&gt;ible and me.tsure&lt; were taken to giv^ the necessary assist ance to General Officer Commanding, Bushire, in case such an eventual ty occurred. The general position of the ships in the north was one off No. 1 Post, Halileh, one off Reshire and one off the busgian Consulate. Later on, one ship ('Bramble^) was taken up Pooda Creek and moored off No. 10 post where she commanded the Mashileh. This is the first occasion on which a vessel of any size has got so far inland and it created a great im pression. Also a battery of thr-e naval 1-2-pr. guns on mobile mountings was stationed at the Residency and from time to time a big naval force was on shore t n assist the troops. In addition a certain number of mines were laid at various points, guncotton being provided by the ' Juno.' Later on, these mines were removed as their utility was doubtful, the only damage done by them being to blow up a few jackals and an old woman. At the end of February Brigadier-General E iwardes, D.S.O-, was relieved by Brigadier- General Doughs, C.M.G. From that time onwards scares were fewer and eventually General Douglas came to the conclusion that he did not consider the presence of a ship up Pooda Creek was nece -sary, nor did he require men to be landed from the ships. The ship was taken away from Poodt.i Creek and gradually all seamen, with the exception of a small guard for the 12-prs.j, returned to their ships and, except for a small party landed from 'Euryalus' to take part in the expedition against Sari Bast and Chakadak, in April, there has been no need to land parties from ilis Majesty's ships since. His Excellency Vice-Admiral Sir Bosslyn E. Wemyss, K.C.B., C.M.G., M,V.O, Commander-in-Chief of the i .ast Indies and Egypt station arrived at Bu-hire on 8th Apr i in H. M. S. ' Euryalus ' and the same day left for .Mesopotamia in H. M. S. ' Imogene. ' &lt;f Juno ' proceeded to Bombay for retit and ' f Euryalus ^ remained at Bushire until the return of the Commander-in-Chief when she sailed south visiting Henjam, Jask and Maskat. At the end of April a partial blockade was established off the Tangistani Coast at the request of the Deputy Political Resident and all sailings to and from those ports were stopped. This patrol was to prevent the possible escape of Wassmass to Arabia and to bring pressure to b *ar on the hostile chiefs who were detaining British subjects at Ahram. The patrol was withdrawn and blockade raised on 10th August when the release of British subjects from Ahram was arranged. A regrettable incident occurred in May when a friendly native of Salimabadeh was fired and severely wounded by men from the hostile village of Karri while he was visiting H. M. S. 'Mozaffer.' The Chief of Karri was given the option by the Deputy Political Resident of paying a fine and tendering an apology in person to the Commodore or having his towers destroyed. Finally, after ample grace had. been given him, the latter course was taken and ' Juno ' and &lt;c Lawrence' demolished two towers and took away two dhows. The following month he repeated and came round to Bushire and made a formal apology on board ' Lawrence.' During April occurred the murder of the native Residency Agent at Lingah. H. M. S. 'Hardinge' was despatched from Bushire and ' Philomel' and a Mozaffer' from Maskafc to endeavour to intercept the murderers but without success as they had landed at Nabaud and gone inland. In June, partly as a punishment for the above and partly to assist the Darya Begi in establishing his authority as Governor of the Gulf Ports 'Juno''' and 'Bramble' in company with the Darya Bei?i in H. I. P. M. S. ' Persepolis ' proceeded to Azalu, Nakl Taki, Chiru and Shiwu and destroyed the towers and forts. A party of tufangchis was landed at each port, the local chiefs dismissed by His Excellency and loyal chiefs installed. The whole affair was most successfully carried out and was only marred by a regrettable incident »ome days later after ' Juno ' had gone south when fire was opened on the Darya Begi's men at Chiru and three of his tufangchis killed and one man in ' Bramble' severely wounded. Hitherto care had been taken to do no damage to the houses in the various towns, but on &lt;f Junos' return to Chiru the town was shelled and set on tire. The resultf w. / g0 persian gulf administration report of the action taken at tbese ports has, I understand, been excellent. At the same time tb natives have been taught that they cannot marder British otncials or assist the murderers subsequently with impunity. The remainder of the year in the northern part of the Gulf passed without incident as far us the navy is concerned. Permanent buoys have been laid to mark the channel into Bushire from the outer anchorage to the customs house. This will prove a great benefit to the boats or ships visiting the place as well as to native craft. On the Mekran Coast there has been some unrest among the local chiefs but on only one occasion has the navy had to interfere. Towards the end of March intelligence was received that one Shahdulla had established himself in the town of Charbar and proposed to sack the town and destroy the telegraph station unless he got satisfaction for the death of a relative who was killed when making an attack on the town in the previous year ' Philomelwas at Masket but arrived promptly on the scene and not only stopped the attack but captured Shahdulla and hi? chief men. A few rounds were fired from her heavy guns and an armed party was landed to aesist the military forces. Philomel' took Shahdulla and his men on board and eventually they were deported to Burma. On the Trucial Coast trouble arose between two of the chiefs! of Shargah and Hamriyah. At the request of the Consul General u Philomel' and ' Clio ^ proceeded to these places and evtntually the quarrel was settled by Captain of ' Philomel' without any fighting which at one time appeared imminent. There was a certain amount of anxiety at Maskat and neighbourhood in June and July owing to aggressive action by the Imam against the Sultanas territory. The presence of men-of-war at Maskat and the adjacent ports prevented any serious action against His High ness. It has been arranged to moor a 500 ton oil lighter at Mattrah Bay to avoid the danger and unpleasantness to the Sultan of storing oil on shore. The oil is for the use of oil burning craft on passage from England to Mesopotamia. The Coaling Deoot at Henjam has b^en greatly developed and is used principally for bunkering transports from Basrah and thus relieving the congebtiou at that port due to labour troubles. A steam launch has been stationed at this place. Various vessels have been employed patrolling for the prevention of the Arms Traffic. Much information of a valuable hydroeraphic nature has been gained and will be most useful in the near future. A set of Persian Gulf notes has been compiled and is still being added to by the Captain of the ' Britomart ' anil these are already invaluable. A copy has been supplied to Deputy Political Resident at Bushire and fulfils a want expressed some years ago by the Chief Political Officer. ji The summer of 1916 has been abnormal, and the crews of vessels of the Persian Gulf I ^ Squadron have suffered severely in health. i :i it jan. ihe two fatter vessels have been hired from the Persian Government (they seized when Bushire was captured on August bth, 1915) at a rent of £3,400 per year. They have been thoroughly refitted and fitted with wireless telegraphy and are an invaluable addition to the Squadron.

APPENDIX II. THE ARMS TRAFFIC IN THE PERSIAN GULF DURING THE YEAR I9i 6 Report by Mr. F. Finsent, Assistant Superintendent, J ask Sub-Ditision, Indo-Eur Telegraph Lepartment, No. 17, dated the 1st July 1916, in connection with the im tion of arms and ammunition into the Mekran, during the half-year ending SOth J 1916. *| Only one landing of ten Snider rifles at Sadaieh was reported on 19th Februarv- n ' to and subsequent to this date no arms, etc., were imported by sea. ^ 10r The number and disposition of the patrols employed remain as at the close of the 1 report. A few modern rifles, the exact or approximate number cannot be ascertained were chas(d at Minab and Bandar Abbas by Baluchis from different districts in Persian Bali V tan and smuggled into the Mekran through the Biaban district. These rifles were dis ^ of to Afghan traders in the Karwan district. The number of these traders during the pe ' d under review has decreased considerably, small paHies consisting of 3 to 4 men were recortpfl to be travelling in search of arms in or about the Karwan district during the winter months but all reports say that they were most unsuccessful in procuring rifles of a modern type and had to purchase weapons of an inferior kind at a high price. The Khalifa of Debai, Saiyid Muhammad Umer, who landed from the Arab Coast last year, is in residence in the Biaban district and it is said that the rifles, revolvers etc he brought across with him are still in his possession. The total number of' rifles etc of modern type reported to be with him exceeds 700, but it is difficult to credit the report and it is impossible to verify the approximate number as no one in the country.

The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel (now Major-General) Sir P. Z. Cox, Fer90nnel . G.C.I.E., K.C.S I., continued to hold charge of the office of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, but his duties as Chief Political Officer with the Meso- potamian Expeditionary Force kept him in Mesopotamia. Major (now Lieutenant-Colonel) A. P.

He was succeeded by Mr. J. H. Bill, I.C.S., who arrived on December 21st. Major M. E. Rae was First Assistant Resident throughout the year, and the post of Second Assistant Resident was held by Mr. Duncan Willey until April 4ith, the latter being relieved by Mr. Vice-Consul Worrall, who was already in Bushire as additional Vice-Consul. Mr. Vice-Consul H. G. Chick, C.I.E., was in charge of the Vice-Consulate throughout the year, and the Post of Consular Assistant remained vacant. Major J.

There have been few events of permanent importance ; the history of the year is a miserable record of crossmtrieneg , Conditions in Bueliire HinterlaLd and on an( j f u til e fighting, due in the main tn Shnaz road. the clash of interests between rival blackmailers on the trade route. The effect of the agreement under which the release of the Shiraz colony has been elfected has been to give the rebel Khans a direct interest in avoiding direct conflict with the British authorities, while it has on the other hand tied the hands of the Residency in dealing with abuses on the road, it is scarcely worth while to trace in detail the petty squabbles which from time to time attained a temporary prominence, and the broad features of the situation may be briefly sketched as under ;— The year opened with Naeir-i-Diwan of Kazerun in open rebellion, and flushed with his success against the South Persia R-ifl.es on the Pir-i-Zan Pass. The spring and early summer were occupied in attempts to induce Soulet-ed* Dowleh to come off the fence and co-operate whole-heartedly in the maintenance of order. As the result of an interview between the Soulet, Colonel Gough and General Sykes, which took place at Khaneh Zinian on i^Sth May 1917, Soulet entered into a formal agreement, binding himself as follows :— (а) to guard the Shahi road from Tang-i-Turkan (one stage below Kazerun) to Dashtarjin with his own men ; (б) to guard the Shahi road from Dashtarjin to Chenar Rahdar jointly with the South Persia Rifles ; {c) to provide 450 men for the above two purposes, these men to be paid from Shiraz at the rate of Tomans 5,050 per mensem; these arrangements to last for three months at least; {d) to keep Nasir-i-Diwan out of Kazerun for six months and put in his own Deputy Governor; (e) to capture or expel Muhammad Reza Dirisi, the notorious anti- British pamphleteer, from Kazerun; (/) to be responsible for the good behaviour of his tribe and pay revenue, in return for which he would be supported in his position as Ilkhani. Soulet succeeded without fighting in inducing Nasir-i-Diwan to absent himself from Kazerun for a few weeks only; he failed to molest Muhammad Reza in any way; and the only other two results of the agreement worth noting are (a) that the Persian Government thought it necessary to notify its disapproval thereof, and (6) that Soulet's guards on the stretch shared by him with the South Persia Rifles immediately began to take rakdari, and Soulet replied to an expostulation on this point by demanding an additional sum of Ks, 300 per mensem as compensation if rahdari were abandoned. In short the agieement was not a succees. In August the Governor-General himself saw Soulet at Dashtarjin and as a result expressed his desire to pardon Nasir-i- Ihwan and wrote letters to Zair Khidar and Wassmuss, with the apparent object of conciliating the former and inducing the latter to leave, by the promise of a safe-conduct to Germany. Another thread running through the tangled skein of Kazerun affairs is the feud between Muhammad Ali Khan, Kalantar of the Kashkuli section of the Kashgai, and Nasir -i-Diwan. One result of the continued disorders on the Shahi road has been to awaken the €upi ity or the Kashgai chiefs in respect of the settled villages near the road. Muhammad Ali Khan (leader of the attack on the Central India Horse in iyii), who owns (while he can hold it) the village of Shahpur near Kazerun, ( L onc ® 1Y€ ; ^ ie ^ ea of extending his influence across the Kazerun plain from t 0r i- 0 kouth and seized the Rahdar caravanserai, and the pass of Tang-i' ui an, commanding the entry of the main road into the Kazerun plain- s t iva m the Kashguli section, Muhammad Khan, also prosecuted similar ^l 0T \\ a8 r ^ ards se 7eral villages in Kamarij and Khisht, and attempted to o py e village of Diris near Kazerun. In these quarrels Nasir'i-Pi^ aI1'FOU 1BE YEAR 1917. took the side of Mubammad Khan, but at one time Muhammad Ali Khan attained such a measure of success that he was able, in April, to occupy Mian Kotal, one stage from Kazarun o i the Sairaz side, and offer it to Sir Percy Sykes for occupation by the South Persia Rifles, an offer which was not accepted. However, by the end of June, Nasir-i-Diwan was in possession of Muhammad Ali Khan's own village of Shahpur, and by the end of the year Soulet -ed-Dowleh, having dismissed Muhammad Ali Khan from the post of Kalantar, had pursued the recalcitrant Kashguli, into Kuhgeiu limits. Heat the same time asserted his authority over the whole section by imprisoning Muhammad Khan, so that the ambitious of both these chiefs were in abeyance at the end of the year. The lower sections of the road were similarly in dispute between the Kalantars of Khisht (pro-British), :\ ur Muhammad Khan of Daliki (originally anti -British, but subsequently somewhat chastened), and the rival leagues of Tangistan on the one side and the Hayat Daud confederacy on the other. Tne principal event of the year was the expulsion of Nur Muhammad Khan from the Konar Takhteh plain, and the occupation of the top of the Kotal-i-Mallu (the nearest of the kotals to Bushire) by a loyal Kadkhuda of Konar Takhteh. This was followed by a serious quarrel between Daliki and Borasjun, as a result of which Nur Muhammad Khan began, in September, to divert traffic to the Shabankareh-Shif route, and finally entered into a comprehensive agree ment with the Khans of Shabankareh and Angali to oppose the Tangistan league in every way, and protect trade on the Shif-Daliki streich. This was a serious blow to the rebel confederates. In the coastal plain itself, intermittent hostilities continued between Shaikh Hussain of Chahkutah, supported by Zair Khidhar, and to a less degree by Ghazanfar-es-Sultaneh, and Ahmad Khan of An^ali, without any decisive result. There was similar indecisive fighting between Ghazanfar and Shaban- kareh. Zair Khidar also had his own troubles, being attacked by a combina tion of Tangistan headmen during May and June. In spite of all these difficulties, trade continued to find its way, often by devious paths, and exposed to ever-increasing exactions, between Bushire and Shiraz, and in spite of the general distress caused by a bad harvest and high prices for necessaries, clearances of goods showed a steady increase over the figures for the previous year. An amusing instance of Satan rebuking sin was a circular letter from Nasir-i-Diwan to the rebel Kuans threatening them with his h )stility if they did not moderate their exactions on the muleteers. Wassmuss continued to make Ahram his headquarters, and did not leave it except for a short visit to Ahmadi, in German activities March, and a move to Khawiz during the heat of the summer. He was joined, in April, by Dettmar, Oertel, and Eruggmann, who appear to have received hospitality from'Soulet, and to have been sent by him to Ahram via Khurmuj, the residence of Jamal Khan of Dashti. Dettmar, however, died of fever at Khawiz, in August, and, on the 18th September, Jiruggmann was arrested close to Bushire Town, while attempt ing to escape from the country. The force made steady progress throughout the year, confining its activities mainly to drill and organisation for the South Persia Rifles. Persian element and to the establishment of law and order by the Indian troops attached on the Bandar Abbas -Kerman, Bandar Abbas-Shiraz, and Shiraz-Tspahan road?, in the latter case as far as the Pars boundary. The Bushire road was held over for future treatment. ^ A number of criminal sections of the Khamseh tribes were successfully dealt with. The situation in this quarter was normal; there was continuous dis order in and about Behbehan throughout Behbehan and Kuhgdu. the year, except for a short period between March 24ith and May 2nd, when two of the younger Bakhtiari Khans made a short and predatory sojourn in the town. This year the Khans deputed were Salar Akram, son of Sardar Zafar, and Salar Bahadur, son of Sardar Muhta- sham, then Ilkhani. Tneir visit was not lucrative, very few of the Kuhgcdu Khans obeying their summons. One exception was Abdullah Khan Onuram, 'who was detained until he paid Tomans 4,000 ; an example which did not4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GrTTLF POLITICAL RESIDENCY tend to attract other Kuhgelu Khans to Behbehan. The defenceless towr.s- people escaped lightly on the whole witn a payment of Tomans 500 from each of the two quarters. Eriendlv relfttions between the Boir Ahmadi Garmsiri Krians and tho Residency were further developed during the year. These are of value for the promotion of order along the trade route from Dilam to Behbehan, and also as imposing a check on Wassmuss' intrigues in this region. Friendly settle ments were successfully promoted between the Khans on the one hand, and the Zeidun Agent of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, as well as the Khan of Lirawi, on the other. Under the strong and wise management of Haidar Khan. C.I.E , these con federate Khans maintained excellent order Tne Hayat Band confederacy. ^ districts and peace amoug ^ selves throughout the year. Haidar Khan has made a considerable profit out of the quarrying operations undertaken for the Mesopotamia!! Expeditionary Force on his island of Kharag, and has been indefatigable in arranging for a regular supply of sailing ships. The Khan of Angali has been involved in considerable expenditure by the hostilities above-mentioned with Shaikh Hussain of Chahkutah, but lias also profited by the increase in the quantity of goods imported via Shif.

BILL, Deputy Political Resident, JPersian Gulf.FOR THE YEAR 1917. CHAPTER II. administration report por the lingah vice-consulate FOR THE YEAR 1917. Mr. G. A. G. MunGavin held charge of the Vice-Consulate throughout the year. Muhammad Reza Khan, the Satwat-ul-Mamalik, son of the Khan of , ~ . iiastak, who was still Deputy Governor Lo,al at the close of 1916, left Liugah on the 12th of January in order to meet His Excellency the Qawam-ul-Mulk, who was touring in the Laristan and Shih-Kuh districts. From 12th January to 23rd February the following individuals, in turn, carried on the current duties on behalf of the Satwat-ul-Mamalik (1) Haroon-al-Rashid Khan, 13th to 26th January. (2) Shaikh Sal eh of Charak, 27 th January to 2ord February. Owing to the Satwat-ul-Mamalik having induced the Qawam-ul-Mulk to take certain undesirable action in the Shib-Kuh ports (which will be referred to later on in this report), it was not considered desirable that he should be allowed to return to Lingah, as Deputy Governor, and His Excellency the Darya Begi therefore appointed Abdul Rasool Khan, ex-Kalantar of Bushire, who took over the duties of Deputy Governor from 24th February. Abdul Rasool Khan, although he at first showed a desire to work fairly well, was nevertheless, without the slightest doubt, about the most hopeless and impossible man the port has ever had the misfortune to have as Deputy Governor. He was dismissed by His Excellency the Darya Begi, and left for Bushire on 9th September. The Finance Agent, Shaikh Muhammad Hassan, acted as Deputy Governor up to 7th October, when the newly appointed Deputy Governor, Kohandal Khan, son of the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas arrived and took over charge. Kohandal Khan, the Etamad-i-Nizam, was still in office at the close of the year. Kohandal Khan, though very young and a trifle inexperienced, has hitherto worked very well indeed and has always shown great friendliness towards the Vice-Consulate. Muhammad Tahnoon, who w^as Agent for His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, at the close of last year, was Foreign repregematives. dismissed on 12th April 1917, and Hajee Ahmad bin Yusuf Khawajah, a nominee of the Vice-Consulate, was appointed in his place. The new Agent is on friendly terms with the British and works well Monsieur Cattersell, remained in charge of the Customs Department until the 23rd of November when he handed c,58tom8 ' over charge to an Armenian Clerk named CarnigK. Kevorkian. He left on the 27th idem for Naseri. Monsieur Dimadis, the former Director at Naseri, was appointed to Linsah, but up to the end of the year had not arrived. Relations between the Vice-Consulate and the Customs Department were most cordial throughout the year. Shaikh Muhammad Hassan relieved the Asaf-ul-Mulk, on 6th April, as Finance Agent. The former is a great Finance Departmant. improvement on his predecessor and during the time he has been in office there has been a decided improvement in local receipts. Shaikh Muhammad Hassan has worked more or less throughout in consultation with His Majesty's Representative.

The Soulet-ul-Mulk, Khan of Bastak, and his son Muhammad Eeza Khan, still remain loyal supporters of His Excellency the Qawam-ul« Mulk. The whole of the Shib-Kuh coast remained very peaceful during the year and the only incident of note being the Shib-Kuh. seizure of the fortress of Chiru, with the port, from Shaikh Ibrahim Hammadi to whom it was given by His Excellency the Darya Begi in 1916. His Excellency the Darya Eegi having taken it from the Obeidalis as a punishment for having assisted the assassins of the late Residency Agent, Khan Bahadur Agha Badr and his tw^o brothers to escape. This w r as a most regrettable blunder on the pa»t of His Excellency theQawam- ul-Mulk, who w r as undoubtedly misled by Muhammad Eeza Khan and his father the Soulet-ul-Mulk, Chief of Bastak, who were inclined to favour the Obeidalis. His Excellency tire Qawam-ul-Mulk, however, did not reinstate the Obeidali Shaikh, but placed Chiru under the Soulet-ui-Mulk, which, however, amounted to virtually the same thing. (A) The most important event of the year was the establishment of a wireless station at Lingah. The old Jask instal- Liugah town and district. lation was transferred bodily and erected at Lingah by Mr. W. J. Hopkins of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The station was opened on the second of October for official traffic, but it was not until the 22nd of December that permission w r as given for the acceptance of private telegrams. The local public w r ere very naturally pleased when sanction w T asgranted for the acceptance of general traffic, owing to the facility offered thereby to trade in general, especially, as regards the pearl trade, as they were thereby enabled to keep in touch with the market rates prevailing in Bombay. (B) A serious dispute arose between the local Deputy Governor, Abdul Rasool Khan, and Saiyid Shubbar, one of the Shiah priests, which led to the Saiyid sending his sons and a crowd of scally-wags into the bazaar, on 26th May, and severely assaulting several persons, including a blind Saiyid, a follower of the opposition Shiah priest. The Deputy Governor thereupon tried to arrest some of the culprits, who took if hast '* with Saiyid Shubbar, and this culminated in numerous rifle shots being fired and the Saiyid collecting all bis followers and proclaiming a 'Jehad' from his mosque. His Majesty's Representative anticipating some such trouble endeavoured to smooth matters over from the start, pending a reference of the case to Bushire, but the Saiyid adopted an unreasonable and pig-headed attitude, and broke all his pledges. When matters had reached this stage, the local Deputy Governor visited His Majesty's Repre sentative and proclaimed himself helpless to do anything, adding that he could not rely on his own tufangchis. A deputation from Saiyid Shubbar also visited His Majesty's Representa tive presenting numerous demands against the Deputy Governor. His Maiesty's Representative saw that unless he adopted a very strong attitude against the Saiyid, matters w r ould go from bad to worse and undoubtedly lead to riot and ^ ere ^ ore dismissed the deputation and warned them that the Saiyid s madness w r ould get him and his followers into very serious trouble, and that he would be held personally responsible for what had already happened, and that the consequences would be all-the-more serious for him, if his crowd w r as not immediately dispersed, or if a single further shot were fired. This had the desired effect ; the crow r d w r as immediately dispersed and the deputation returned with promises from the Saiyid to behave himself, and guaiantee his followers would also. He also begged for promises of pardon and admitted he had acted foolishly. oa r It was, however, considered that the presence of one of His Majesty's ships would have a salutary effect on the town (especially as the Vice -Consulate guard at the time only consisted of five men, 14 having been sent to India as an escort for prisoners), and in response to a wire, H. M. S. 'Lawrence' Ml0Min S e ^g with Rear-Admiral D. St A. Wake, C.IE., on j u as everything was then quiet, the Admiral proceeded to Bushire. Hfij i fFOR THE YEAR 1917. 9 however, very kindly arranged for H. M. S. ' Britomart ' to visit Lingah the following day. H. M. S ' Britomart ' only remained here about 36 hours. His Excellency the Darya Begi called at Lingah on the 17th of June in the Persian Sloop ' Persepolis ' and expelled Saiyid Shubhar and three of Irs sons and one or two followers. This action had a very good effect on the town, and w ; ll no doubt teach the Saiyid and particularly his sons a lesson. The Saiyidhas for ^ ears been a troublesome character. A Military Eield Post Office was opened at Lingah on the i6th of March, and Military and Consular mails for Condition of roads. Shiraz were run via Basiak and Lar up to the end of July, when the Service was rlisoontinued and diverted via Bandar Abbas. When once properly established, the service worked very well. The average time taken between Lingah and Shiraz and vice versa was about eight to ten days. The post w r as again started via Lingah, Bastak and Lar towards the end of September, but was finally run via Bushire. There was a very large increase in caravan traffic on the Lingah-Lar route over 1916, roughly about 12,000 animals entered and left the town. Owing to the demand up-country for general food-stuffs, prices in Lingah were attimes abnormally high. In August a bag of sugar weighing 2 cwts. cost Es. 72-8-0.

Mail service was maintained by the Persian Customs launch, which plied between Lingah and Henjam connecting British interests. with the British India Steam Navigation Company's Mail steamers at the latter port Mails were occasionally also brought by His Majesty's Transports, w r hich visited the port on ten occasions. The port suffered throughout the year from the scarcity of merchant steamers visiting the place. Only two steamers of the British iiidia Steam -Navigation Company visited the port. The other vessels to call here were the Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company's S. 3. ' Zayani on three occasions, the S,S Paroo ' on one and two Japanese vessels paying one visit each.

Sartip Mirza Ali Karam Khan, Shuja-i-Nizam, held the post of Deputy Locni Government. Governor throughout the year. He worked loyally and indefatigably in British in terests. Not only has he co-operated with the Political Authorities to the best of his ability ; but the South Persia Rifles and Military Authorities owe him a deep debt of gratitude for all the assistance he has rendered them, particularly in the matter of arranging transport for conveying troops, equipment and foodstuffs from the Base to the Interior. If it had not been for his great efforts to collect transport there is no doubt the work of the South Persia Rifles in the interior would have been greatly hampered. Agha Nad Ali Khan held the post of Deputy Governor, Minab, up to the 13th June when he was relieved by Mirza Kohandil Khan. The latter, on appointment to the Deputy Governorship of Lingah, was relieved by Yawar Haji Khan, Mashshaq, on the 13th September. The Shuja-i-Nizam performed the duties of Karguzar at Bandar Abbas during the year. Monsieur Guillaume held the post of Director of Customs throughout the Cug| . oma year. On the whole relations between him and the Consulate were good particularly towards the latter part of the year when they could not have been better. M. Guillaume made strenuous efforts to obtain the reinstatement of his protege, Abdul Khaliq, as Hammal Bashi (an Agent employed by the merchants to handle their cargo in the Customs House). His Majesty's Consul, who had the previous year objected to Abdul Khaliq, withdrew his objection and co-operated with M. Guillaume for his reinstatement; but the merchants, both Persian and Indian, united to oppose the measure and M. Guillaume abandoned Ms intention and himself proposed to retain the services of the present incum bent, Since then everything has gone smoothly and, at the end of the year, relations between the merchants and Customs were excellent. Several raids were perpetrated by Arabs of the Pars District during the „ t ysar under report, the three most daring Condition of country. t. ., A .. J , . „ , 0 being those committed m December. On the 5th December a party of ten horsemen and 30 footmen raided to within 13 miles of Bandar Abbas and carried off several hundred camels and donkeys which had been collected by the Deputy Governor for the South Persia Rifles. Some ten camels belonging to the 10th Camel Corps, which were grazing in the vicinity were also taken. An unsuccessful attempt to intercept the raiders was made by the South Persia Rifles and the Deputy Governor. About the 20th December a party of Engineer Officers, insufficiently escorted, rode right into a large number of Arab raiders at Ab Mar 73 miles from Bandar Abbas near the Tang-i-Zagh. Major Lowis had his horse shot under him but the party made good its escape without any further casualty. The same night the raiders followed the Engineer Party up and attacked their camp but were driven off. The raiders were said to have had three of their number killed or severely wounded. The third raid occurred on the 28th December when a large band of raiders attacked a large South Persia Rifles caravan at Sarzeh (39 miles12 ANNUAL REPOED OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY north of Bandar Abbas) and succeeded in carrying off all the animals consist- ino- of 390 camels, 41 donkeys and 8 ^ mules 200 ot the camels were the Dronertv of Government tbe remainder being hired animals. A small quantity of Government stores was also carried off by the raiders. The situation in Minab gave grave cause for anxiety. On the 3rd June the Chief of the Guard of the Deputy Governor, Minab, ^\as muidered by Tahirzais at the instigation of Mir Barkat, Kalantar of Biyaban. The Deputy Governor letaiiated by killing three Tahirzais and capturing 280 of their camels. Mir Barkat. promptly raised a lashkar and marched on the town of Minab which was within an ace of being captured by him. It was necessary to restrain Barkat till reinforcements could be sent to the Deputy Governor of Minab. At the request of His Majesty's Consul H. M. S. ' Bramble ' was sent to Kohistak to show the flag, and the South Persia iiifies despatched 100 men to the assistance of the Deputy GoTernor, Minab, who was thus enabled to drive off Barkat at a most critical time. In the meantime a small expedition was organised by His Excellency tbe Governor of the Gulf Ports with our assistance in ammunition and money. His Excel, lency proceeded by sea in the Persian Gunboat k&lt; Persepolis'; and the Deputy Governor of Bandar Abbas, who had taken over command of the force at Minab marched by land to Sirik, the principal village in Biyaban, which was entered on August 10th by the combined force. Mir Barkat declined to fight his patron, the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and retired to Bashakird where the Government troops were unable to follow. Negotiations then ensued, but Mir Barkat refused to accede to the Governor's terms which were to band over the murderers of the Chief of the Guard and to pay up his arrears of revenue. The Governor thereupon appointed Mir Gul Muhammad (son of Mir Hazi the | late Kalantar) as Kalantar of Biyaban and withdrew his force from Biyaban leaving 30 riflemen to support Mir Gul Muhammad. Later, Lieutenant- Colonel Trevor visited Biyaban where he met Mir Barkat and succeeded in obtaining from him a promise to pay up two years' revenue and to restore a 7-centimetre gun which he had captured in the fighting at Minab. Mir Barkat soon afterwards fulfilled his promise and the Governor of the Gulf Ports le'nstated him as Kalantar. The expedition may, on the whole, be considered a success for it saved Minab, one of the richest districts on the Persian littoral from falling into the hanas of Mir Barkat, and it proved to Mir Barkat that the Persian Govern ment, supported by us, was still powerful enough to punish him for his rebellious action. The fact of the Government forces marching through his district and occupying his principal seaport was a great blow to his prestige and there is no doubt his followers suffered great hardships in the retirement to Bashakird. Notwithstanding the unsafety of the caravan routes, particularly between J Trade Kerman and Yezd and Sirjan and Yezd and the high freights by land and sea, the trade of Bandar Abbas continued to increase. Hie shortage of steamers from India was made good by large numbers of sailing boats which brought large quantities of merchandise from India. Prom about the middle of the year arrangements were made for the British India Steam Navigation Company's subsidiary mail steamers to call once a fortnight on the voyage out from Karachi. Limited quantities of merchandise were imported by these steamers. Steamers of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, the Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company and the Line of Chartered Japanese Steamers continued to call from Bombay till about the middle of the year when the calls were discontinued. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company increased the depth of their boring from British in'erest8. 1,300 to 1,800 feet during the year Owing t to the difficulty in obtaining steainer 8 to bring the necessary oil fuel from Abadan for the working of the engines the work of boring was greatly delayed.

The force in the Bandar Abbas area consists of but one regiment (the 1st South Persia Rifle.. Abmad Shahi) of Infantry numbering about 600. The men have been recruited for the most part from among the inhabitants of the low-lying districts extending from Minab in the east to Tangistan on the w r est. A detachment of the regiment is posted at Gahkum (Tahrum) situated about half-way between Bandar Abbas and Saidabad. The regiment has not had a proper chance of developing into a well-trained unit owing to the heavy escort and garrison duties it has had to perform and the frequent changes of officers. During the year under report the regiment w T as commanded by no less than five different officers. The reasons for such frequent changes w r ere due, firstly, to a shortage of officers in the whole force of South Persia Rifles in South Persia and the consequent necessity of posting suitable officers to more important posts in the interior; and, secondly, to the unhealthy climate of Bandar Abbas. On the 21st September 31 riflemen, forming part of the detachment proceeding to Gahkum, mutinied at Chah Ali and'made off with their service rifles and pouch ammunition. Captain Wall, who w r as commanding the detach ment, rode after them unarmed with the intention of trying to persuade them to return. He succeeded in getting six of the mutineers to return but the remainder declined to; and after deliberately firing at Captain Wall, fortuna tely without hitting him, continued on their way. His Majesty's Consul promptly communicated with the Deputy Governor of Lar and Bastak, through whose districts the mutineers would have to pass to reach their homes, and14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSTAN GULF POLITICAL BESIDENCY asked them to block the roads and arrest the mutineers. The result was most satisfactory. The Deputy Governor of Bastak captured 22 of the mutineers and sent them in chains to Bandar Abbas along with 13 rifles and 331 rounds of ammunition. The remainder of the liflys and 19b rounds of annnunitiQ^ were received bv His Majesty's Consul from the people of Kauristan who had had a scrap with the mutineers and disarmed them. The prisoners were tried by court-martial and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. Ovvin^ to delay in deciding on a suitable site for a cantonment no building had been erected up to the end of the year, and officers and men have had to be accommodated in mat huts and in tents. It is not at all surprising that many of the oiiicers have been unable to stand the severe climatic conditions and ha?e had to be invalided. Fever was very prevalent during the first half of the year owing to faulty sanitation. Major J. M. Holmes, I.M.S., an expert in sanitation, was deputed to improve the sanitation of the camp. With the co operation of the Deputy Governor and His Majesty's Consul, a small village of mud huts situated within the camp limits was purchased from the owners and the huts demolished and disused wells were filled in. The result of these and other sanitary measures introduced by Major Holmes was most marked, Mosquitoes were reduced and there was a considerable falling off in the hospital attendance and fewer hospital ships were requisitioned to take patieats to India.

Foliticnl History. —During the first three months of the year Kerman T^oi anvpvnniATif politics continued in the state of unstable Local Go\ euunent. equilibrium in which they had been since the return of the Eritish. Responsibility for good government in the province was divided between the Governor General, Prince Is T usrat-us-Sultaneh, and the Deputy Governor and Chief Local Magnate, Sardar Nusrat. The Prince, a pleasant but vain and obstinate youth, without experience of affairs and com pletely under the influence of his machiavellian Secretary, Ihtisham-ud-Dowleh, was jealous of the Sardar's local influence and of his power to hinder in his own interests the Governor General's peculations and general spoliation of the Province. The Sardar's own chief methods of self-enrichment have alw T ays been the avoidance of payment of revenue on his lands, and the taking of a liberal share of the Government money entrusted to him in virtue of the offices, such as headship of the ' Army,' he usually holds. His policy is not so much to make money by taking bribes and blackmail from the people, ss to stand between them and oppression from other quarters, thereby increasing his own local influence and authority and strengthening his position against hostile Governors and Financial Agents. His point of view, therefore, was fundamen tally opposed to that of a Tehrani Governor General, especially one who was a Royal Prince and regarded the Sardar as rightfully his servant. As time went on, it became increasingly clear that no real reconciliation was possible between them. A rapprochement, which resulted in a precarious peace between the Prince anil Sardar Nusrat for two or three months, was brought about early in the year by the appearance of a common enemy in the shape of Mirza Assadullah Kur- distani, the new Financial Agent. An account of the struggle between this able and energetic official, assisted by His Majesty's Consul on the one side and the Governor General and Sardar Nusrat in unholy alliance on the other, is given below. As soon, however, as Kurdistani was finally defeated and forced to leave Kerman, in July, enmity between the erstw-hile allies began to smoulder once more, and, in September, the Prince recommenced his complaints to His Majesty's Consulate against the Sardar. He accused him, probably not without truth, of mole-like intriguing against the authority of the Governor General, and showed signs of taking sides against the Sardar in the Democrat campaign against him which became virulent in September. Knowing that the British regarded Sardar Nusrat as the head cf the Anglophile party in the province, the Prince Governor did not dare, so long as Major Lorimer was Consul, to attack the Sardar openly. No doubt he remembered the ill-success of his efforts in that direction in August 1916. As soon however as Major Lorimer had left Kerman, in October, the Prince determined to bring matters to a head and rid himself of the Sardar for good and all. He was undoubtedly urged on this course by Ihtisham-ud-Dowleh, who, besides being hand in glove with the Democrats, wanted the Deputy Goverrorship for himself, and also knew that so long as the Sardar was in power opportunities of profit for himself and his master would remain limited. The Prince was further influenced by fear of16 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY the Democrats and of the anti-monarchical movement in general, and considered it both necessary and convenient to sacrifice the Sardar on the Democratic altar. Having, as he thought, secured the Consulate's neutrality, the Prince early in November removed Sardar Nusrat from the Deputy Governorship and refused to have any dealings with him at all. At the same time he urged the Shah by telegram to summon the Sardar to Tehran, and arranged, through Ihtisham for the Democrats to send numerous telegrams to the Persian Government against him. Later, he obtained the Sardar's dismissal from the last of his dignities, the Headship of the local Army. The Sardar and his friends did not of course, lie down under this treatment; they too endeavoured frequently and at great length to enlist the support of His Majesty's Consulate, and send frequent telegrams to Tehran against the Governor General. Early in Noyem- ber orders came that Sardar Nusrat should be sent to Tehran/ This could not be allowed, as it would have meant the utter ruin and spoliation of the Sardar, his family and property; and after correspondence with His Majesty's Vice-Consul on the subject His Majesty's Minister sent a imss^e to the Sardar advising him not to leave Kerman. The Prince Governor was much put .out by the opposition of His Majesty's Vice -Consul and informed the latter, on December the 1st, that he had sent in his resignation as his honour was involved and he could not remain in Kerman an hour longer if the Sardar stayed. His Majesty's Vice-Consul, who had throughout been working for a reconciliation, induced the Prince to remain at his ^post pointing out that, having reduced the Sardar to the position of a private citizen' he could afford to leave him alone. The year ended with prospects of a recon ciliation apparently more hopeful, though it was destined that, as early as 8th January 1918, hostilities should be re-opened against the Sardar and other Ano -lo- philes by the Prince and the Democrats, resulting in the discomfiture of 'the latter party and the final departure of the Governor General. Apart from his relations with His Majesty's Consulate in connection with Sardar Nusrat. tlle Governor General and Kurdistani, r • ji j. ..t Sardar Nusrat has continued to be on nendly terms with tiie Lntish and, on occasion, of considerable use to them. Though his efforts to produce recruits for the South Persia Eifles have been somewhat barren of result, Consulate and South Persia Eifles alike have been sure of help m any ordinary matter referred by them to the Sardar, whose great local influence usually renders such help effective. It cannot be doubted that the sardar s attitude is dictated largely by self-interest and his conviction tbat e n s ert 1 to stay; but this fact does not necessarilv detract from his utility, and m any case his friends must take him as they find him. Himself a andowner on a considerable scale, he has also been, since 1916, the lessor of the i e ' slYe P ro P er ties in the Kerman province; in both capaci- factor in the situation.

The chief diffi- la 18 ln herent m the anomalous position of the FinancialFOR THE TEAR 1917. 17 Agent vis-h-vis the Governor-General, namely, that the former, though he has no force at his disposal, is supposed to act as a check upon the latter. Kurdistani was dependent on the Governor-General for the armed sowars necessary for enforcing the payment of revenue in the districts, while the Governor- General refused to supply him with any unless he received first the whole or a part of the pay due to him. His Majesty's Consul was asked to obtain a loan of Tomans 10,000 from the Imperial Bank of Persia for this purpose, but refused. Finally it was arranged by way of compromise, that Kurdistani should provide Tomans 2,000 on account, whereupon the Governor- General would send out sowars accompanied by agents representing himself and the Revenue Department. These agents would collect revenue on ' hawalahs, ' or drafts issued by the Revenue Department on the dues of tbe various districts, amounting to Tomans 37,000. The Governor-General was of course determined that most of the proceeds of these hawalahs should go to satisfy his own demands and those of his satellites, which amounted to the dispro portionate sum of over Tomans 10,000 a month, while similarly the Sardar's mental reservation was that as little revenue as possible should be collected from his own and the Farman Farma's lands. As the Sardar's authority among the sowars themselves was considerable, he had ample opportunities of securing this end. It was not surprising, therefore, that the scheme in ques tion was not particularly successful in relieving the financial straits of the Revenue Department. Community of interest between the Governor-General and Sardar Nusrat as against the Revenue Department, together with Kurdistani's not over-diplo matic methods of negotiation, resulted in the latter's complete estrangement from the Governor-General who accordingly formed an offensive and defensive alliance with the Sardar. During the next three months (April, May and June), the war of intrigue continued with varying fortunes, into which it is not necessary to go in detail. All sorts of trouble was engineered by the Sardar for the Revenue Department, culminating in a prolonged strike on the part of the entire staff of clerks who decamped taking with them the keys of the office strong boxes ; while the Prince did his share by bringing continual pres sure to bear on the Shah. So long as he was supported by the Tehran Government, Kurdistani carried on as best he could, though all hope of re-estab lishing the solvency of the province was at an end. Tow r ards the end of April, however, Yossuq-ud-Dowleh's Cabinet definitely deserted him, and for the next two months the Governor-General and Sardar Nusrat had their way and worked the Financial Department to their own satisfaction. In June the new Democratic Cabinet of Ala-us-Sultaneh showed signs of wishing Kurdistani to remain in office, but the Prince defeated this by his usuiil method of sending in his resignation and with the Sardar's help getting up an agitation in his own favour to prevent the resignation being accepted. The agitation con sisted of basts at the Telegraph Office, ' popular ' telegrams to the Persian Government, attempts to close the bazaar, ^nd so on. As it appeared to be of a definitely Democratic character. His Majesty's Consul brought pressure to bear upon the Prince to put a stop to it. This he did, but not before he had been successful in preventing the acceptance of his own resignation and in finally ejecting Kurdistani, who was replaced by Shaikh-ul-Mulk tow r ards the end of June and left Kerman on the 18th of the following month. The moral of the Kurdistani episode is that under the present system, if a Financial Agent does not conciliate, one might almost say pander to, the local powers that be, he has no chance of success. Kurdistani indeed, if he had been able to win over either party, might have attained his ends; but the Sardar Nusrat was too old an enemy, while his own brusqueness and uncom promising attitude hopelessly alienated the vain and touchy Prince, The result was that although he had the moral support and active assistance of His Majesty's Consulate, Kurdistani was unable to withstand the combination against him. Apart from the imbroglio with the local authorities, His Majesty's Consul co-operated with Kurdistani in various other matters. One of these was the important and still unsettled question of the rates at which revenue is payable oniTAa/isa ' lands. Nominally payable in kind, these revenues have longANNUAL EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GTJLE POLITICAL RESIDENCY bGGn commuted a.t low arbitrary rates fixed separately for each estate or grout) of holdings by special firman. Of late the Persian Government have been insisting on universal commutation at current market rates, an innovatioii which would cause much hardship and which His Majesty's Consul and Kurdistani, successfully for the time being, opposed. Another important matter was the farming of the opium revenue by the Persian Government to a .Russian protege called Tomaniantz This involved not only the very serious loss to the Kerman Eevenue Department of the opium taxes, but the possibil ity of extensive Eussian interference in the affairs of ^ the province. Bis Majesty's Consul made representations to His Majesty's Minister on the subject with the result that tne Persian Government excluded the provinces of South Persia from the contract with Tomaniantz. Subsequently the Tomaniantz contract was annulled for the whole of Persia and a new system inaugurated whereby the collection and handling of opium revenue in all Provinces were taken out of the hands of the local Einancial Departments and entrusted to a Central Opium Department. The Tehran Government hope thereby to secure for themselves a larger propor tion of the provincial opium revenues than reached them under the old system. In Kerman province, for example, this source of revenue is worth from 300,000 to 400,000 Tomans, but only some 7,000 or 8,000 Tomans 0£ this reached Tehran during the last financial year. The co-operation of His Majesty's Consul with Kurdistani in Eevenue affairs, instead of eliciting the gratitude of the Persian Government, appears to have provided the anti-British elements at Tehran with an additional grievance. On 14ith July the Ministry of Finance issued an order, addressed to the Sistan Finance Office but obviously aimed at Kerman, warning provincial innancial Agents against all direct official communication with representatives of foreign powers. Shaikh-ul-Mulk kept these orders dark till 18th October, just after the departure of Major Lorimer, when he sent a copy of them to His Majesty's Vice-Consul. When, again, Mirza Habibullah Khan arrived from Tehran, in November, to take the place of Shaikh-ul-Mulk as Financial Agent, he lost no time in hinting to His Majesty's Vice-Consul that he had instructions from Tehran to have as little to do with His Majesty's Consulate as possible. To this His Majesty's Vice-Consul has no objection, as he is convinced that without a definitely recognized share in the financial administration of the province, His Majesty's Consulate can do little or no good by iiueriering in the working of what is at present a hopelessly anomalous and unpractical system. Kamal-us-Sultan held the office of Kar^uzai throughout the year. Though Karguzar. week, feather-headed ard inconsequent to a degree, he has on the whole done hii best to retain the goodwill of His Majesty's Consulate. The permanent element in the Karguzari is the Assistant, Mirza Habibullah Kban, a quiet, elderly man of some ability and considerable local knowledge and experience, who undoubtedly exercises a steadying influence on Kamal-us-Sultan. His Majesty s Consul had little fault to find throughout the year with the conduct by the Karguzar of the numerous cases referred to him. On two or three occasions indeed when the dismissal of the Kargnzar was mooted. His Majesty's Consul strongly opposed it, expressing satisfaction with Kamal-us-Sultan and depre cation of a change, lest worse might befal. In the autumn, like most of the other Kerman officials, the Karguzar showed^ signs ol bending before the Democratic blast, and his attitude became less satisfactory.^ While socially and in private correspondence more friendly than ever, officially^ he began to give His Majestv's Vice -Consul trouble in various matters; while he sent to the Persian Government several telegrams unfavourable to the South Persia Eifles and in other ways tried to acquire merit with the Democrats. This attitude was, however, largely the result of pressure from Tehran, especially in the question of the status of the Sooth Persia Eifles {vide below). . an( ^ a ? a ^ n i 11 December the Karguzar was severel y taken to tasK by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for not reporting British 'activities and aggressions,' for giving information to His Majesty's Consulate regardiog Oemocrat affairs and for not being sufficiently ' impartial.' At the same tiiscPOR THE YEAR 1917 a Tiolent campaign was conducted against him in the Tehran papers. These deTelopments frightened him so much that he sent in his resignation and had to be dissuaded by His Majesty's Vice-Consul and assured of British support. Since then his attitude has been marked by indecision and vacillation, but has been more amenable. His position between the devil and the deep sea is certainly not a comfortable one. The Department of J ustice (Adliya) was administered throughout the other Kemau officials. year by llaji Jalal -ul -Mamalik, a venal and incompetent person with the outward appearance of a publican, but consistently friendly to the Consulate Majd-fMslam arrived in January to take up the post of Superintendent of Education, but his appointment was strongly opposed by enemies in Kerman and he was not finally appointed till April! In November, however, the Tehran Democrats, who look upon the Education Department as their special preserve, succeeded in replacing Majid-ul-Islam by Agba Yahya agairst the wishes of His Majesty's Consulate. The new Rais-i-Mu'arif is^a noted Demo crat who was one of the members of the Majlis returned for Kerman at the last election. The headship of the local Military Department was held by Sardar Nusrat and of the Eoad Guards (Qarasaran) by his brother Adl-us-Sultan, until the end of the year when, as described above, the Prince Governor removed them both in. pursuance of his private feud. They were replaced by the Prince's music-master and by a nonentity called Zahir-ul-Huzur respectively. The Municipality (Baladiya) and the Police were both administered by Prince's men,' the incumbent in the latter case, iVasir Mizam, being an ex-farrash boshi of the Governor-General's household. Both proved them selves convenient channels for the flow of cash into the pockets of the Prince and his Secretary, but apart from that their departments do not appear to have been more than usually mismanaged. The Deputy Governorship of Sirj an was held throughout the year by The Districts. Mirza Mahmud Khan, who has given complete satisfaction to the British military authorities at Saidabad and may be regarded as a valuable ally. He was particularly useful in connection with the operations against Hussain Khan and the ^-prisoners, and with the march of the Shiraz reinforce ments through his district in the early spring. Owing chiefly to Mirza Mahmud Khan's failure to pay regularly 200—300 Tomans monthly douceur demanded by the Governor-General, he was several times during the year in danger of being removed from his post on one pretext or another. On each occasion however His Majesty's Consul intervened successfully on his behalf. &amp;haukat-us-Sultaii and other Saidabad notables are also actively friendly. Bam and Narmashir have been ruled during the year by Sardar Mujallal, a son-in-law of Sardar Nusrat, though during most of the time he resided in Kerman and administered the district by proxy. Sardar Mujallal is a pleasant and well-disposed man of no very marked ability, but energetic and genuinely anxious to keep his district in order. He has frequently been actively helpful to His Majesty's Consulate and the South Persia Bifles. The Aqta Afshar was held by Muhtashiimud-Dowleh, uncle of Sardar Nusrat, until June, when he was removed for oppression with the concurrence of His Majesty's Consul. His final downfall was caused by a * bast' taken against him at the Baft Telegraph Office by the people of Deh Sard, who alleged that he illegally extracted Tomans 1 5 300 from them. His place w r as taken by Asaf-ul-Mulk, then Eevenue Agent at Baft. Like the Deputy Oovernor of Sirjan, Asaf-ul-Mulk has been in constant correspondence with His Majesty's Consulate since his appointment, and relies largely upon British support. During the summer when the Daulatabad-Baft road from Bandar Abbas was in constant use by military caravans, telegraph construction parties, etc., Asaf-ul-Mulk worked hard to keep them supplied, a matter of consider able difficulty owing to the drought and the destruction of the previous season's crops by locusts.20 ANNUAL REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Tlie remaining less important districts were held partly by Prince^ men' and partly by 4 'Sardar Nusrat's men''whose names it is*unnecessary to record. During the first five months of the year little was heard of the Democrats Democrsta. P ^ evideutly stJI m the cbastened mood induced b their defeats of the previous year and the fines and deportations —moderate and limited enough—which followed the return of the British. - The formation however, of Ala-us-Sultaneh 's Cabinet, early in June, following the collapse of monarchy in Eussia, caused a marked revival of Democratic activity. The release of the Kermani prisoners at Shiraz and reports from Tehran of the strong Democratic sympathies of the new Cabinet greatly encouraged the party at Kerman. All sorts of wild anti-Ally rumours began to spread abroad - it became known that the Governor-General was afraid of what was regarded as the rising tide of Republicanism, and was arranging a strategic retreat to India; meeiings were held nightly at one or other of the houses of leading Democrats such as Muin-ush Shariya, Agha Saiyid Jawad, Mirza Shahhab and Shariat Madar, while Majtabids such as Agha Saiyid Ali and Shaikh Muhammad Taki secretly espoused the cause. A powerful ally was found in Ihtisham-ud-Dowleh, the Prince's Secretary, while at Tehran the partv was ably represented by Mu'ayid-ul-Islam (brother of Muin-ush-Shariya), Saiyid Mustafa (^r-Eais-i-Muarif), Muham-ul-Mulk (e^-Karguzar), Ali Khan Qariat-ul-Arabi and others, who corresponded regularly with their confreres at Kerman. Judging by events, the main items of the Democratic programme were the following: — (1) Obstruction and, if possible, removal of the South Persia Rifles. (2) War to the knife against Sardar Jsusrat and his family Haji Mirza Ali Muhammad Mujtabid and his brother Haji Mirza Murteza and one or two other Anglophiles who had the courage to oppose the party during the disturbances. (3) Amnesty for all persons who took part in the pro-German disturb ances of 1915-16 and return of exiles to Kerman. (4) Employment of Democrats in Government departments. Evidence of the first item is to be found in the series of reports hostile to the South Persia Eifies which were sent from Kerman to Tehran and were reflected in the newspapers of the Capital, mainly malicious accusations of all sorts of aggressiveness, arbitrariness and disregard of Persian rights and independence. The Tehran Government encouraged these accusations and on several occasions took up complaints, on which His Majesty's Consul had ultimately to report. The burning of Fatehabad under Captain Merrill's orders in March, the operations in September against Dehaj and the expedi* Hon in October against Javazm, Marvas, Herat-i-Khurreh and Shahr Babak {vide below) were of course made great grievances. The persistent refusal of the Persian Government to recognise the South Persia Eifies as a Persian department is part of the same policy. Attacks on Sardar Nusrat and the other Anglophiles began to be marked in August. They frightened the Sardar at any rate, if not the others, into an attempt at compromise, which, however, thanks partly to the uncompromis- ingness of the Democrats and partly to warnings from His Majesty's Con sulate, the Sardar soon gave up. Democrat hostility was at first confined to popular telegrams to Tehran and violent newspaper articles against him, but alter Major Lorimer's departure it crystallized into a sustained attempt to humiliate and ruin him, as described above, through the agency of the Gov* er nor-General. The return of several of the worst pro- German agitators was pressed up 011 His Majesty's Consulate during the latter half of the year and in some cases, Botabiy those of Saiyid Ali Nunwa (banished for seditious talk in August 1916), and Mirza Ahmad Khan (leader of a band of sowars employed by the Geimans), opposition had eventually to be withdrawn. The release, at theFOR THE TEAR 1917. 21 Persian Government's request, of the four Kermani enemy agents who fled to Shiraz in the summer of 1916 and were arrested there was considered a great triumph for the Democrats. The invasion of the public offices by Democrats was latterly most marked. His Maiesty's Consul prevented the nomincition of the Demociat leadcij Muin -ush -Shariya to the post of Rais-i-Adliya, in August, but the Muin afterwards obtained a subordinate post in the same department. Practically all the clerks in the Revenue office are now Democrats. The most striking Democratic success of all was the appointiiient, under protest from His Majesty s Vice -Consul, of Agha Yahya, formerly Democrat member of the Majlis for Kerman to the headship of the Education Department. ^ This gentleman solemnly promised His Majesty's Minister, before lea\ing Tehran, not to mix in Kerman politics ; this promise he proceeded to break almost immediately on arrival. , . • ^ Generally speaking, the Democrat party, not only m Kerman but m other towns of the province, notably Rafsinjan, gained considerably both m numbers and confidence during the latter half of the year. There is little however, to fear from anv active expression of their hostility so long as the bouih Persia Rifles remain, as it is at present, uninfluenced^ by Democratic pro paganda. The most they can do, and are doing, is to increase tne difeculties of His Maiesty's Consul by undermining the goodwill of the officials and others with whom he has to deal, and by influencing the Persian Government to hamper his efforts on behalf of British interests. Pollowing on an exceptionally dry season in 1916, little or no rain fell 0 untilthe very end of tne year, and only Condition of Country. a fraction of the usual amount of snow covered the hills in the spring. Locusts ravaged the high-lying cultivated lands of the Aqta Afshar and Sirjan during the winter and spring,, but thanks partly to the destruction by the local authorities of a large quantity oi eggs and partly to the ever-increasing drought, the pe&amp;t was stamped out. Owing to these causes, however, the summer crop was at least 50 per cent, below the average. In June the price of wheat at Kerman had risen from 12 to 19~2( Tomans a Khar war (650 lbs.) and of barley from 8 to 12-13 Tomans , y December the shortage was marked, the nominal price of wheat as nxed by the local authorities being 22 Tomans per Kharwar while in reality it was difficult to obtain at Tomans 28 or 29. Owing to the weakness ot the local government little was done to prevent hoarding, or to secure for Kerman a share of the stocks which undoubtedly existed in the Rafsinjan and Bam districts. Measures were indeed taken, the theory being that of the 30 Kharwars re quired by the city per diem, the local government supplied the bakers wit 20 from its own ambars. In practice, however, bread was often unobtainable at mosthakers 5 shops, and the unsettled condition of popular feeling during the latter part of the year was partly due to this. Only the remarkable timor- ousness and lack of spirit of the average Kermani prevented bread riots ; for though the price of bread did not reach the heights it attained elsewhere, the margin of subsistence is also much lower at Kerman than a iraz, Ispahan, Tehran, etc., and the people are generally much poorer. At Bam the price of wheat rose from 7 to 16 Tomans, though m the autumn the Kerman Government fixed it at 12 Tomans; t is rise, as as appeared since, w r as mainly due to hoarding. The fodder shortage resulting from the drought was even ser10 ^ 9 ' owing to its effect upon the cost of transport. Towards t e en o e y ar very few camels were being used upon the roads, while the cost per ^ of freight by donkey rose enormously owing to the fa-ct tha caravans roads had to carry all their own barley for the whole journey. n Abbas road freight rose from 2a Tomans^O and even 80 Romans P^karwar during the 2nd half of the year, and owing to oouth Persia i es p it was extremely difficult to procure even at those figures. e P™? • ^ x j and firewood in Kerman and to a greater degree still the prices o a ^ n f n commodities were affected by these conditions. Loaf sugar rose rom 18 and even 20 Krans a Tabrizi man (-Rs. 1-4-1-10 per lb. according to22 ANNUAL EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL EESIDENCT rate of exchange), Kerosine from 5-7 Krans to 9-10 Krans per man feanir lent to about lis 23 per 4-galloa tin). ^ a ' Much inconvenience was also caused in the town by the high price f firewood, which partly owing to shortage of transport and partly to tb - - enormous consucnption by the South Persia Rifles (10 Kharwars a day) ros 6 to 30—32 Krans per Kharwar or roughly lis. 2-4 per Indian maund, ' 8 The province was remarkably free from internal disturbances durin» the Dieturbftncee. ^under report, in spite of the scarcity and the efforts of the Demoerats de- scribed above. In the west of the province the outlawed Hussain Kh Buchaqchi with Shahzada Hussain and the Turkish ' Ambassador ' ObeW 1 ulla managed to evade the efforts made by the Saidabad garrison to capture' them. They took refuge at first in Kuhiscan on the Pars side of the border later among the fastnesses of the Chehar Gumbaz range and were no doubt iu regular communication with the German and Austrian ^-prisoners in Pars and with Wassmuss at Ahram. Although how ever Hussain Khan's brothers, Murad Khan Shikuh-us-Sultan and Bahman Agha and other Buchaqchis at Saidabad undcubtedly helped him secretly while professing eternal friendship with the British the Buchaqchi tribe as a whole was quiet, and the rebels did not dare to repeat their attempt on Saidabad of the previous September. In August they made their way via Yezd territory to Tehran where they were received with open arms by the anti -British party. This lack of enterprise on the part of our enemies of the year before was undoubtedly due to the march through the province of the Shiraz Rein- ^mnents Column, in February and March, and to the strengtheninc of the Saidabaa garrison from it. The Column, which consisted of 20 British officers 48 Entnsh Non-Commissioned Officers and 1,400 Indian Officers and men of the Ibth Kajputs, Burma Mounted Infantry and miscellaneous details, reached oaidabad in two echelons on 18th and 24th March respectively. Half of the Burma Mounted Infantry were left there, and the town was shortly afterwards made the headquarters of the Vlth South Persia Bifles Infantry. Narmashir, Jiruft and Eudbar suffered as usual from the incursions and general turbulence of the neighbouring Baluch. At the beginning of the year the Governor of Bam was forced to enrol 150 levies in addition to the 100 a ready kept up lor the delence and policing of Bam and Narmashir.

Condition of Roads. (1) From Bandar Abbas; via Eudbar-Jiruft in winter and Daulatabad- Baft in summer. (2) From Tehran via Yezd. (3) From Khorasan, usually via Naiband in the Lut. (4) From Bam and JS T armashir. 'With the exception of (2), there was very little robbery within Kerman borders on any of these roads during the year. In the spring tbe Baharlus showed signs of activity on the Daulatabad-Baft road but the organization by the South Persia Eifles of levies at Baft with posts at dangerous points along the route soon put a stop to it. The levies at the latter posts were abolished later in the year, but by that time the organization of the Saidabad-Tarum route further east, forming a kind of cordon against the robber tribes of Fars, had its effect in defending both the Paulatabad and the Jiruft route against attack from that direction. Only one robbery on the Khorasan road, C that of a large Birjand caravan at Haur, in February, by Pai Qalehis and Shehr Babakis, came to the knowledge of His Majesty's Consul. On the Tehran road, on the other hand, serious robberies by Lashanis, Tutakis, Chaharrahis, fehahr Babakis, Pai Qalehis, etc., occurred at the rate of four or five a month until the end of August when successful operations by the South Persia Eifles put an end to them for the rest of the year. The raids culminated in the blocking of the road at Darwaza and the Kermanshahan Pass by two parties of Lashanis, each 200 strong. On 28th August South Persia Rifles infantry and a squadron of cavalry from Kerman made a rapid movemem against the Lashanis in co-operation with the Bakhtiari road guards. Id four actions on the 28th and 29th they inflicted severe blows upon them, recovering large quantities of transport and loot, killing or wounding about 30 robbers and capturing a considerable number of rifles. A few days later the South Persia Bifles infantry destroyed Dehaj, the village in the hills above Anar which the robbers used as their base, and brought the headmen and a quantity of stolen property into Kerman. At the beginning of October further operations against the maraudino; tribes were undertaken by Colonel Farran with one squadron cavalry, one platoon infantry and one section mountain artillery. The expedition visited Javazm, Khabr, Marvast, Herat-i-Khurrah and Shahr-i-Babak, at all of which places it destroyed forts and seized all rifles, ammunition and stolen property found in them; but none of the robber bands waited to try conclusions with the South Persia Rifles or oppose their march, and as they had had ample time to remove themselves and most of their flocks and property out of reach, the positive results of the expedition were not so marked as those of the August- September operations. During the last four months of the year the Tehran road was left severely alone by the robbers, posts and caravans arrived regularly and even the Democrats had to admit that the 'atrocities and aggressions' of the South Persia Rifles had had a result most beneficial to Korean. As- a result of seme five months' agitation on the part of His Majesty's „ , . Consul, the Kerman-Bandar Abbas postal Postal Service, . i • i i i i T- t service, wmcn had been exceedingly irregular and slotv during the winter, was improved and, by April, was working ^'ith reasonable regularity and despatch, The route used until then went via Daulatabad and Bait to Saidabad (Sirjan) and thence via Rafsinjan to Kerman. TMs entailed a considerable detour, and on representations from His Majesty's24 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY Consul it was eventually changed, the Kerman mail coming direct from Baft in two days and a subsidiary service being arranged between Baft and Saidabad From April till the end of the year no delays en route occurred worth mention ing, and letters took from nine to twelve days from Bandar Abbas instead of the previous three to six weeks. During the summer the Bost Office was forced by lack of transport to discontinue the carriage of parcels, and an arrangement was made with the South Bersia Eifles whereby private parcels were carried by their tri-weekly caravans by the Saidabad-Tarum route. This unsatisfactory system appears recently to have been discontinued.

Wagstaff, C.T.E., commanded the garrison at Saidabad, which after April included the 6th South Fersia Eifles Infantry. A squadron of Cavalry and a platoon of Infantry were stationed at Anar during the latter part of the year. The system of policing roads and outVyino- districts by means of tribal levies has not been followed to any ^ great extent, the only instance being the 100 irregular foot and horse, chiefly Afshars, stationed at Baft under Sultan Yahya Khan. Mu'tamid-i-'Nizam. There is no doubt that the fact that the South Persia Rifles are being raised and trained on strictly regular lines causes many tribal and sectional chiefs to forbid their tribesmen to enlist. They fear, perhaps not without reason a transfer of their followers' allegiance from themselves to the South Persia Ernes, in particular the Buchaqchi tribe, which is generally considered to be the best fighting stock in the province, has provided no recruits at all, though with the exception of the notorious Hnssain Khan the members of its chief family swear undying devo tion to the British Cause. Recruits obtained up to October 1917 from other fitting clans were : Afshars, Cavalry 86, Infantry 26; Shahr Babakis, Cavalry 44, Infantry 102. Recruiting is, however, proceeding briskly among these tribes' and these numbers are now probably greatly exceeded. The refusal of Ala-ui-Sultaneh's Cabinet, underpressure from the Demo crats to recognise the South Persia Rifles as a Persian force was the cause ot correspondence in the autumn between His Majesty's Vice-Consul and he Legation. The Karguzar was ordered to insist that all intercourse between the South Persia Kifles and Persian Departments be earned on ' medium of His Majesty 's Consulate and the Karguzan. This was out of the question, and after consultation with Colonel Parran and refe^ Majesty's Minister, His Majesty's Vice-Consul iniol ™ edt t h ® ^^'^'municat- Commandant, South Persia Rifles, found the present system_ (of comrnn a ing direct with Persian Government Dejiartments), convonient. ^ Government have ceased for the time being thear attempts o hamper and ■ discredit the South Persia Rifles in this particu ar ^nner but them s no doubtthatthemerefactof their non-recognition of the force has a disturbing effect upon the minds of some of the Persian omoeis. -rw c o The death from enteric fever of Captain G.

Messrs. H. S. Tavshanjian &amp; Co., New York, represented by Ch. Jafferson. Messrs. V. H. Jinishian, New York, represented by Mirza Missirian. Messrs. Costikyan, New York, represented by A. Mugerditchian. Business is at a low ebb, but the export of carpets and rugs has not by any means ceased. Eussian interests consist solely of the private affairs of a few importunate ex -agents at Bam, Rat'sinjan, Sirjan, etc., together with one at Yezd who indulges in troublesome and complicated litigation in the Kerman province. A considerable amount of work, from which locally at any rate nothing is rained, devolves upon His Majesty's Consulate from its obligation to look after these 'interests' of its erstwhile Ally. In October the Muharram traffic from the infected districts of Khorasan and Kain resulted in an outbreak of Chol0ra ' cholera at Rawar. The Persian quarantine station at Darband having evidently been useless, the South Persia Rifles Medical authorities arranged with the Local Government for the establishment at Rawar of a better-managed quarantine station, the tents, incinerators and other apparatus for which were supplied by the South Persia Rifles. Owing, however, to the venality of the officer in charge and the failure of the local authorities to provide supplies for the people detained, the epidemic spread and the whole of Kuhbanan and Zarand were affected. Cases averaged 20-25 and deaths 10-12 daily. This state of things was of course carefully concealed from the Kerman medical authorities, but as soon as it leaked out Captain J. B. Hance, I.M.S., Senior Medical Officer, took decisive measures to save the city from an epidemic. Anew quarantine station, managed entirely by the South Persia Rifles, was opened at Sariasiab, 20 miles north of Kerman, early in December, and the tents, etc., of the Rawar camp were removed there. With the help of the South Persia Rifles Cavalry and some Local Government sowars, together with ' A' Section, Supply and Transport, all travellers from the north were accommodated and provided for in the camp for 10 days before being allowed to proceed to Kerman. All side roads between infected areas and Kerman were blocked, as well as the Khabis road which connects with one of the roads across the Lut to Birjand and Kain. Thanks entirely to these measures, Kerman escaped what would undoubt' edly have been a serious epidemic. Following on a phenomenally mild winter the hot weather set in early but was not marked by any unusally high Meteorological. temperatures. The year was practically rainless until Christmas, when heavy falls of rain and snow commenced and have continued at intervals since. C. P.

ADMINISTPbATION REPORT FOR THE PERSIAN MEKRAN COAST FOR THE YEAR 1917. Mr. E, E. Gunter was in Political charge of the Mekran Coast throughout the year. Personnel. The arms imported into Persian Mekran during the year under review numbered 91 rifles, 8 revolvers and 6 060 Gun-runmng. rounds of ammunition. The majority of the rifles were of old pattern. Ammunition is very difficult to procure. Several Afghans have been reported to be in the country trying to purchase arms but do not appear to be very successful. Only old fashioned muzzle, loaders or others of an inferior type, seem to be available. The condition of the country during the year has been on the whole tranquil. Persian Baluchistan. Khalifah Khair Muhammad removed from Moganshaboo to Karkindar in March and his entry into that part of the country was marked by interference with the telegraph lines. A letter was received from him by Mr. P. Pinsent, Assistant Superintendent of the Jask Sub-Division, asking for an interview mta a representative of Government. He came to R.apch with a small following and informed the lineguards at that place that if a favourable reply was not received he would murder them and destroy the lines. He was informed in reply to his letter that before the question of his meeting a representative of Government could be considered, Government wanted to know what security he would give for his future good conduct. No reply was received to this letter and Sardar Islam Khan then took the matter up and offered the Khalifah Ks. 500 and a portion of land if he would return to Eanooch and abstain from causing interference with the telegraph line. The untimely death of Islam Khan prevented the arrangement being completed but Yahya Khan, the eldest son of Islam Khan, has married the daughter of Khalifah Khair Muhammad and it is to be hoped that the latter will not cause us further trouble. He is reported to be at Eanooch, In the month of February, at the request of Mir Islam Khan, Mir Barkat left for Bint with a following said to number 500 to settle the differences between Islam Khan and his brothers Sahib Khan and Nagdi Khan, arising out of the death of Mirza Khan. They arrived at a partial settlement and the ill-feeling between Islam and his brothers was for a time moderated. Mir Earkat and Islam Khan then went with a large following to Gaih to settle the differences between Hussain Khan and Islam Khan. Fighting took place between Mir Hoti of Lashar, who took the side of Hussain Khan and Islam Khan, and Mir Barkat with several casualties on both sides. Through the intervention of Mir Rustam Khan of Champ peace was restored. Mir Barkafc and Islam Khan, returned to Bint on 27th February without a final settlement having been arrived at. In April, on refusing payment of the taxes by the people of Bir, Hussain Khan confiscated 90 camels belonging to them. Islam Khan despatched his son Ayub Khan to support the Biris, whereupon Hussain and 50 men retired towards Charbar after some fighting and took up position in an old fort at Tez which was afterwards surrounded by Islam Khan's son with 200 men. As the place is \ ery near Charbar and there was likelihood of the latter becoming the scene of fighting if Hussain Khan took shelter there, a notice was given to the combatants that we should prevent Hussain Khan bringing camels into the village and the other party entering it and that if anv British subjects were the J 0fficer Commanding the detachment would drive them out of ar ar an get a ship to shell them. Hussain Khan took refuge in Charbar and wrote to Mudat Khan, his guardian, for reinforcements/ Mir Nawab Khan came to Charbar with a following and escorted Hussain Khan to Gaih.FOR THE YEAR 1 91 7« 29 At tlie end of July a fight was reported to have taken place at Dabi Kand near Minab between Mir Barkat and the men of the Minab assisted by some of the South Persia ivifles. It is said that the Persians were defeated in the fiffht and a gun and ammunition (afterwards returned), and some military stores fell into Mir Barkat's hands. His Excellency the Darya Begi came to Biyahan with some troops and a settlement was eventually arrived at. Mir Barkat then paid the major portion of the taxes and complied with the con ditions of Parya BegL He was reappointed Zabit of Biyaban by the Persian Government. In September, Wali Muhammad, a British Indian subject, residing at Pashtiari, killed a Baluchi of that place and took refuge with Mir Din Muhammad. Several letters have been sent to the above chief to send the murderer to Charbar for settlement of the case buc without effect. Early in October Sirdar Islam Khan left Bint for Kasserkund. At Surkboor he was shot dead by some men of Sahib Khan's. He had halted to say his prayers and had allowed his following to go on and was shot in the act of remounting his horse. Islam Khan was married to a sister of Mir Barkat and had a son Nabi Bukhsh by her. Yahya Khan the eldest son of Islam Khan, sent his brothers Ayub Khan, and Nabi Bukhsh to Mir Barkat to ask assistance to revenge his father's murder. Mir Barkat left Biyaban for Bint with a large following towards the end of the year to take up the cause of his relatives. Islam Khan was a strong and progressive chief and his death is to be regretted. All old claims against Mir Ashraf Khan have been settled. Other claims to the extent of Rs. 362 against the late Sardars Saiyid Khan and Abdi Khan were settled daring the year.

Extra subsidies for the protection of the telegraph line were sanctioned by the Political Department to the above chiefs and Mir Barkat for six months from 1st January 1917, and were renewed for another six months from 1st July. The telegraph lines between Cbarbar and Jask were interrupted, owing to 'wilful damage, for 49 hours during March, 70 hours during June, 28 hours during August, 46 hours during November and 48 hours during December.T' 30 annual report of tee persian gulf political residency The Director left Karachi on the annual tour of inspection on the 14th November and, after visiting all Tour • telegraph stations up to Basrah, returned to Karachi on the 30th December.

The whole cargo was looted' by the followers of Mirs Barkat, Mustafa and Hoti, the lion's share went to Mir Barkat. The bugla was brought to Jask by one of His Majesty's ships and afterwards towed to Muscat. A quarter of the deck gear was returned by the Chiefs and sent to Muscat. The report of Mr. A.

GUNTER, Director, Fersian Gulf Telegraphs, in Political Charge Mekrati Coast. r x Mr. A. Cane's report, No. 15, dated the 7th January 191S, on the condition oj the districts between Biyahan and Bahu. Petty squabbles of no real or political importance^ have occurred but will always occur at different times among these half-civilised tribes. In January there was a slight unrest at Rudbar but nothing of impor tance occurred. The ill-feeling between the late Islam Khan and his brothers was a mi c a Wy settled, or at least moderated, by the former's permitting e J the revenues of the district, and by bis granting them half o is p ^ in the event of his predeceasing them.32 ANNUAL EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY The Khalifah having returned to Karwan, some interference with the Telegraph lines was resumed, and the people became somewat unsettled by his presence. The destruction of lines was often thieatened but since no considerable damage was done it is possible that those who brought information had exaggerated. Towards the latter end of the year Islam Khan offered the Khalifah Es, 500 and some land to settle upon to keep him (the Khalifah) quiet, and to have some hold ovei* him against any inclination to interfere with the Telegraphs. This offer was accepted but was only held for a short time, Islam Khan being murdered, some say at the instigation of Sahib Khan at Surkh Boor by 12 of the latter's followers. The Khalifah then announced that he and the Karwanis would only recog- nise Sardars Yahya, Ayub and Nabi Bukhsh as rightful administrators of Karwan and Bint, and declined to acknowledge Sahib Khan and Nagdi Khan. The life of Sahib Khan was attempted at Bint by Yahya and Ayub but Sahib Khan was only slightly wounded, and Yahya and Ayub took refuge with Mir Barkat. Some trouble subsequently occurred between Yahya and Sahib Khan, in which there were a few casualties. In the early part of the year Mir Barkat came to terms with Mir Gul Muhammad, Mir Haji's second son, with whom he had had some differences One Qaseem, brother of the late Muhammad Ali of Minab, looted 700 camels from Murad Ali, a subject of Mir Barkat, and it is stated three men were killed in the affray. Barkat, in retaliation, collected a Lashkar and, after attacking and defeating a Persian force, he retired to the mountains to await events, having captuied some loot and a small gun. Several attempts were made by Darya Begi to get in personal touch with Mir Barkat, but to no avail, the latter not wishing to put himself in Darya Begi's power. After long correspondence between the two, a certain amount of revenue w T as paid by Mir Barkat, and matters seem to have automatically adjusted themselves, Mir Barkat, it is understood, being pardoned on his undertaking to behave well in future. ^Mir Barkat was reappointed Zabit of Biaban vice Gul Muhammad Mir Haji, who was relieved. Gul Muhammad, when living, committed considerable depredations in the surrounding villages, mainly towards Minab. In November, Mahmud Khan's son Azim Khan shot Jan Muhammad son of Mir Eaqir Muhammad of Shahrek, in the latter's district In retalia tion a subject of Bustam Khan shot six of Mahmud Khan's men looting consi derable property. Incidental'y some fightin'; occurred between Yahyaand Sahib Khan. A Mekran subject named Moola Moosa of Gwadur trading in Bahu was robbed, it is said, of some 7,000 rupees worth of goods, for which outrage Mir Ashraf and Mir Din Muhammad mutually recriminate each other; the robbery took place in Mir Din Muhammad's territory. So far nothing appears to have been settled. 1 he general condition of the country is fairly satisfactory, and the chiefs appear to be favourable to us at present. Little or nothing was done in the arms traffic, and no case of slave dealing) either of import or export, was reported. Many people from the interior migrated to the coast at the latter end of ISovomber, owing, it is reported, to drought in their own country.V FOR THE YEAR 1917. 33 CHAPTER VI. administration report for the arabistan consulate for the year 1917.

' Soon after the publication of the notice an ' Adliyeh ' (Court of Justice), was formed in the town and the following persons were appointed mem' bers ;— (1) Saiyid Hassan—a Shushtari trader representing the Persian mer chants, (2) Haji Ob aid Darwish—a Bahrani trader representing the Arab merchants. (3) Heskil Dawood Habboob—a Jew representing the Jewish mer- chants. These three delegates worked under Shaikh Chasib until the end of June when they submitted their resignations to the Shaikh, through Haji Eais. The reasons for this, they explained, was that their presence in the Adliyeh was anomalous as Shaikh Chasib decided all cases without any reference to them. This matter was settled by Haji Eai^ who undertook to make better arrangements, and the members withdrew their resignations. About the beginning of February His Excellency the Shaikh appointed his second son, Abdul Hamid Khan, Deputy Governor of Ahwaz, mce Shaikh Sultan, son of the late Shaikh Hanzal. Shaikh Abdul Hamid Khan and his staff left for Ahwaz to assume charge on the 12th February. Shaikh Sultan on handing over the Deputy Governorship to Shaikh Abdul Oamid Khan returned to Mohammerah. Shaikh Sultan is living in Mohammerah with his mother and family, and His Excellency the Shaikh pays him a subsistence allowance of tomai.s 200 a month. In June, Shaikh Chasib appointed Shaikh Mehdi, son of the late Shaikh Salim (Shaikh Chasib's cousin), ' Mir Bahr ' (Port Officer), of Mohammerah, and advised the Consulate of the appointment by letter which stated that ' Shaikh Mehdi would be responsible if any pilferages took place in lighters engaged through him.' Shaikh Mehdi acted as Port Officer until the end of the year, and performed his duties satisfactorily. The three hostages, Najaf Quli Khan, son of Sartip Khan, Ghazban, son of Kazem Khan, and Gulam Eeza Khan, son of Darab Khan, who were sent to Mohammerah in 1916, were allowed to return to their respective homes. Imad Daftar, Dizfuli, who was sent to Mohammerah in 1916 for his objectionable conduct, was allowed to return to Dizful in May. Muhnmmad Zaman of Shush tar and Quli Khan Shushtari were sent down from Shushtar during the year to be kept under surveillance. Both are living in the Shaikh's Palace. Baqer Khan of Shushtar, who was sent down from Shushtar to Moham merah, was sent to Basrah and thence to India. News of the fall of Baghdad was received here on the 12th March. The town was decorated by day and illuminated by night by order of His Excellency tlie Shaikh. His Excellency the Shaikh celebrated the occasion by giving two dinners; one to the officers of the British and Indian Convalescent Depots, and the other to the European civil residents. . the 10th December the Insignia of a Grand Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire were delivered to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, G.C.I E., K.C S I., Shaikh of Mohammerah, in Durbar at his Palace at Eailiyeh. The presentation was made on behalf of the Hon ble Major-General Sir Percy Cox, G.C.I.E, K.C S.I., Civil Commissioner in Iraq, by Major-General Sir George MacMunn, K.C.B., D S.O., Inspector eneral of Communications, Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force.

The Department worked smoothly under Monsieur Van den Abeele, who Customs was in charge throughout the year. The Department worked satisfactorily during the year. His Excellency Pog , g the Shaikh has tentatively agreed to pro vide funds for building an extra storey above the ground floor room now occupied by the Post Office. This work will shortly be taken in hand by the Executive Engineer, Basrah, In August a notice was received from the Director of Postal Services, Basrah, to the effect that the parcel and V'. P. Post was suspended until further notice, the reason for this being that it was habitually and grossly abused by merchants. The question, however, of permitting resumption has been taken up by the Civil Commissioner. Sir William Maxwell, Director General of Posts and Telegraphs in India, visited Mohammerah and inspected the Post Office during the year.

ADMINISTRATION EE POUT FOR THE AHWAZ VICE-CONSULATE EOE THE YEAR 1917. Captain E. W. C. Noel, C.I.E., held charge throughout the year. Captain p ersOnI10l&gt; T. C. Eowle remained as Assistant Poli tical Officer, Ahwaz, until February and was succeeded by Mr. E. G. B. Peel on the 21st April. Khan Sahib Mirza Muhammad continued as Head Mirza. The post of head clerk was held by Mr. Nadir Shah, from 16th July 1915 to 22nd June 1916, by Mr. P. Bagyanadham from 23rd June 1916 to 30th May 1917 and by Mr. S. Sequeira from 1st June 1917 to date. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Atta Muhammad remained in charge of the dispensary until July 1st when the dispensary w r as absorbed by the new Civil Hospital. The latter was in the charge of Assistant Surgeon K S, Hick until the arrival of Captain T. H. Bishop, I.M.S., as Civil Surgeon on llth Septem ber. General. The year was a tranquil one in Arabistan. The partial failure of the rains v.as responsible for a general rise in prices and all grain and fodder required by the troops and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had to be imported. By the end of the year distress would have been general but for the demand for labour in Basrah Over 3.000 coolies, mostly hillmen, were shipped down from Ahwaz during the last three months of the year. An Assistant Political Officer w T as Dizful and Lunsian- posted at Dizful throughout the year. Efforts made to popularise the Dizful-Khorramabad caravan route met at first with most gratifying success and, during the last three weeks of June, nearly 10,000 loaded animals went up the road. The use of this route was the more important as the Lynch Road was closed by Kughelu raiders from the end of May, to the beginning of August. Captain Edmonds, Assistant Political Officer, Dizful, left for^ Tehran vm Khorramahad and Burujird early in September. He met with a great, reception in Khorramahad but, soon after he had left the town, reports of his death were circulated and the Direkwand, thinking that the reign of order in Luristan was at an end, fell upon a large caravan of 600 mules carrying loads for Messrs. Lynch Brothers, which was within a mile or two of Khorramabad. Shortly afterwards another caravan of several thousand loads, belonging to native merchants, was seized by Direkwands two days' march out Of Pizful. Captain Edmonds returned to Khorramabad and succeeded in getting back a few of the loads but there is now little hope of recovering the remainder. As a result of this robhery the Dizful-Khorramabad route is practically closed to caravans. His Royal Highness Ain-ul-Mulk, Governor-General, left for Tehran in May and did not return. His successor, His Excellency Vikar-ul-Mulk, who had formerlv served as Deputy Governor under Nizam-us-Sultaneh, did not arrive till January 1918. On the 2nd November a serious disturbance occurred in the town during the absence of the Assistant Political Officer who had been temporarily deputed to Dizful. At the instigation of the leading members of the Kalantar family, Haji Saiyid Abdullah/ Imam Juma, who had been Rais-i-Adliya for the past year, was waylaid and murdered by four hired assassins^ The town was given over to rioting until the following day when Captain Greenbouse, Assistant Political Officer, with an escort of cavalry arrived after a forced38 ANNUAL EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GTJLF POLITICAL EESILENCT march fron Shush and succeeded in restoring order. Two days later a moie- able column from Ahwaz consisting of cavalry, infantry, and artillery entered the town. Trials were held by the Assistant Political Officer assisted by the Deputy Governor of Shushtar and the sentences were confirmed by the General Officer Commanding, Karun Front. Three members of the Kalantar family,viz,, Agha Saiyid, Agha Mustapha and Agha Mirza Muhammad Reza Khan were sentenced to death and shot and nine other persons received terms of imprison ment ranging from one to six years, with deportation. At the beginning of August Captain Noel left Ahwaz for Dalun where he Kugheia aft™. ? 0 his arrangements for a tour through the Kughelu country. It was bis intention to visit the Bahmai Chief, Hussain Khan, at Qalai Mumbi and travel thence via the Taybi and Boir Ahmedi countries to Palad in Bakhtiari territory. Unfortunately the hostility of the Taybies, who had been consistently looting the Lynch road and were rather nervous in consequence, made progress beyond Mumhi impossible and Captain Noel was compelled to retrace his steps and enter the Bakhtiari country by the Lynch Road. He was able to glean much useful information during his stay at Qalai Mumbi and obtained some specimens of coal and iron ore which have been sent to England for analysis. An excellent site for a hill station, at a height of 8,000 to 9,000 feet, has been discovered in the Mungasht range which divides the Bakhtiari countrj from Kughelu. The beginning of the year found preparatiors in progrecs for the formation Bakhtiari affairs. ot a Bakhtiari Levy Corps, one of several schemes which had been devised for the purpose of counteracting Russian influence on the Isfahan side of the border, and, in February, formal sanction was received to the raising of a force of 200 infantry and 100 cavalry under British Officers with headquarters in Chahar Mahal. In conformity with the same policy Mr. Harris, the then Acting Vice- Consul at Isfahan, was deputed to Dehkurd to watch over our interests. Un happily the local intrigues so preyed upon his mind that he took his own life three months after his arrival in the Bakhtiari country. No successor was appointed. The intrigues of Amir Mujahid had rendered it almost impossible for Sardar Muhtashim to continue as Ilkhani and, in order to leave the latter a clear field, it was arranged that Amir Mujahid should leave the country for an indefinite period. Sardar Zaffar, in return for the settlement by us of his outstanding claims against the Persian Government and the promise of our support of his candidature on the Ilkhaniship next falling vacant, agreed to spend eight months in India. i ^ arrival of the Ilkhani and Ilbegi in the low country, it became c ear that their attitude had changed and that they w r ere in no mood to further our interests. This change of attitude was due primarily to the administrative measures adopted by us at Dizful and Shushtar, measures dictated by the mili- ary s^uatron but having as their result the elimination of Bakhtiari influence S ! 1 f e 1 t . 0wris wit f 1 C0118i derable financial loss to the Khans. Moreover, Sardar Muhtashim was tired of office and anxious to resign. In these circumstances support of our policy could only have been pur- chased with ^ concessions which we were unwilling to make and accordingly His Britanmc Majesty s Vice-Consul submitted proposals for a new combination Ilbe»i e^IIOrs, viz * Sardar Zaffar as Ilkhani and Sardar Ashjaa as Qo a is !^ r ^ ^ rst su PP or t e( i tiie n ew combination ; the resignation of sardar Muhtashim was accepted and a telegram sent to Sardar Zaffar asking Mni v.'/? e ® ver &lt; the Government. The departure from the country of Amir MnwL ^ Tes V 0 ™ e , t0 the friendly intervention of the Shaikh of further. promised to support the new Ilkhani, was not pressed11 &gt;\l f If FOR THE TEAS 1917. 39 The effect of the Russian Eevolution now made itself felt in Tehran and the Minister telegraphed , that he was no longer able to support Zaffar's can didature in face of the hostility shown to the latter by the Tehran Khans who desired that Sardar Muhtashim and Amir Jansf should continue in office until the tribes returned to the Ailaq when Sardars Jung and Bahadur would be sent down, nominally to examine the situation but really as future Ilkhani and Ilbegi. The sequel showed that this move on the part of the Tehran Khans was mainly bluff. Their real objection to Zaffar was based, not on personal grounds, but on the fact that he was our nominee and they hoped that if he was elected later without our support they would be able to extort a promise from him to oppose the presence of British representatives in the Bakhtiari country and the formation of tribal levies. In view of the changed situation in Russia and the circumstances attending Zaffar's election to the Ilkhaniship, it was decided to drop the Levy Scheme for the time being. In July Sardars Zaffar and Ashjaa were elected Ilkhani and Ilbegi respec tively by the tribes with the consent of the Khans in Tehran. For several months past Sardar Muhtashim had completely neglected to ensure the safety of the Lynch Road, with the result that the Kughelus recommenced their depredations and the road was virtually closed tliroughout the greater part of the summer. With the advent of Zaffar a complete change took place and, by the first week in September, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Isfahan, S was able to report that unexampled order had been restored on the road. There can be no doubt that the new Ilkhani is sincerely attached to our interests. He has naturally iiad to contend with considerable opposition from the party of Sardar Muhtashim and his position has been rendered more difficult l by the general scarcity due to failure of the rains and to the ravages of locusts. At one time he declared his intention of remaining in the high country throughout the winter, but promises of financial assistance and of arms and I ammunition for his projected expedition against the Kughelus have induced i; him to change his mind. Transport was carried on under exceptionally difficult conditions during Lynch Road. the year under review. ! Semi-famine conditions prevailed in all sections of the road, but particu- i larly in the hill sections, owing to the failure of the previous year's crop. The cost of barley at some stages reached the hitherto unheard of figure of Krans 30 per Shah maund, but even at this figure it was frequently unobtainable at some stages. Muleteers have in consequence had a very bad time and many of them have become bankrupt. The rate of mortality among their animals was also high, the result of overloading and under feeding. Kughelu raiders were very active from May to July and the notorious Eiza Juzdani and Jaffar Quli continued to exact heavy tolls from all caravans - between the Bakhtiari border and Isfahan. The rate of hire rose from Krans 22 per Shah maund, in January, to Krans 28 during the following months after which easier rates ruled for the remainder of the year, the lowest being Krans 11 per Shah maund. The ave rage rate for upward cargo was £100 per ton and for the downward £27 per ton. These high rates were due to the excessive price of fodder and to the fact that the supply of transport animals was quite unequal to the demand. In spite of these adverse conditions Messrs' Lynch Brothers have had a record year, the weight of goods forwarded by them amounting to 46,964 cwts. as compared with 29,525 cwts. in 1916, the previous record. Large profits have also been made by native merchants chiefly in piece goods and sugar. The forwarding of piece goods except for goods handled by Messrs Lynch Brothers is almost entirely in the hands of the Jewish merchants. The 10' pipe line was completed in January 1917 since when it has h e en continuously in commission with satisfac- Anglo-Persian Oil Company. tory results&gt; Concurrently with the pipe line construction an additional pumping station, to deal with the extra through-put, was erected at Tembi. ^ Eight Lancashire boilers were transported up country in sections and rivetted40 ANNUAL EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY owin^ greater in situ. Four additional main oil pumps, each capable of puming 10,000,000 gallons per month at a pressure of 700 lbs. per square inch, were also installed. The pumping station was completed in April 1917. Afire occurred at Tembi pumping station ^ on ^ the 9th July to the bursting of a high pressure valve on the main discharge. The part of the old pumping station was destroyed and the new pumps were only saved by the extreme gallantry and self-sacrifice displayed by Messrs. Lindsay and Still, the former of whom lost his life while engaged in turning off the oil at the boilers. Repairs were completed and pumping resumed within eight days of the outbreak. The Gudar Landor scheme for pumping water to the fields from the Upper Karun had to be abandoned owing to the difficulty of procuring tbe necessary material. Arrangements are being made to utilize the old 6' pipe line from Abgunji to the Fields as a water line and to pump the water from the Ab-i-Gargar at a point about five miles distant from Abgunji. When the scheme is completed about 200,000 gallons of water per day will be available at Tembi. During 1917 the Company's Geological staff in this district surveyed the Mughab and Andakha districts, also the country between the White Oil Springs and Mamatain and the Tul Bazun area to the east of Maidan-i-Naphtun. With a view to securing sufficient grain for their transport animals during the next few years, the Company have leased S,750 acres of land at Hussaina- bad, in the Shushtar Miyanab. They have erected at Hussainabad two Steam-, driven Centrifugal pumps, each having a capacity of 180.000 per hour, to, pump water from the Ab-i-Gargar into the old irrigation canals.

Major L. B. H. Haworth, I.A., held charge of the office of the Political Pei , soimel Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Con sul throughout the year. During his absence on one month's privilege leave and recess, from the 12th October till the 30th November, Captain J. M. Brickman, 3rd Brahmans, was in charge of current affairs. The post of Agency Surgeon continued vacant. The Medical Officer of the 108th Infantry officiated as Agency Surgeon in addition to his other duties until the 28th May when, on the departure of his regiment for Basrah, he was relieved by the Medical Officer, 3rd Brahmans. Sub-Assistant Surgeon J. P. Mascarenhas remained in charge of the Hospital and continued to do excellent work. It was intended that he should he relieved in the month of December, but Muscat has such a bad name that it is difficult to find any one willing to take up the appointment. Monsieur A. Jeannier was Consul for France throughout the year. Abdulaziz-al-Ruwahi continued as Dragoman. Monsieur Jeannier has now been Consul for over 7 years. At the close of the year 1916 the Sultan had been unable to make headway against the rebellion which originated in Condition o t e country. re ig n} 1913 j anc [ which had deprived him of the towns of Niswa and Izki in the interior of Oman, the Wadis Semail and Mnavval, in which valleys he and his family own con siderable property, and of the town of Nakhl which lies near Burka and is about 25 miles from the coast. In the remainder of Oman proper the rebel Shaikhs had thrown off all allegiance to the shadowy authority formerly possessed by the Saiyids or Sultans of Oman and Muscat. The Fort of Rostaq, and the country dependent on it, was still held by Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim bin Qais, a semi-independent chief of the Sultans own family of Abu Said. The rebels, apparently determined to leave nothing to any member o^ this family, decided, in the early months of the year, to complete their con quests by taking this fort. The leadership of the rebellion had resolved itself into a triumvirate con sisting of the Imam, Salim bin Rashid el Kbarusi, representing the religious element and the titular head of the movement, Shaikh Isa bin Salih el Harithi, leader of the Hinawi section and Shaikh Hamyar bin Nasir el Nabhani, leader of the Ghafiri section of the Omani tribes. The attack on Rostak had not the support of the Hinawi 'leader, a fact which has had a considerable effect upon Omani politics. Of the three leaders Shaikh Isa has by far the greatest influence outside of his tribe though Shaikh Hamyar has the greater tribal following. The Chief of Rostaq had full notice of the impending attack and laid in ammunition and suppltes. He also wrote to his cousin, the Sultan, for assist ance and His Highness sent additional stores and ammunition but the fort was invested before they could reach their destination. His Highness, having obtained the assistance of the Shaikh of Baraimi, raised a force of some 2,000 or 3,000 men and attempted to relieve Rostaq but he was deserted by his followers, the deserters being led by the Shaikh of Baraimi. As long as the question was one of drawing rations and money the Sultan had a numerous and eager army but, on the approach of fighting, he was left with only a handful of his own immediate adherents.42 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GIJLE POLITICAL RESIDENCY His Highness was thus obliged to give up all hope of relieving his cousin and the fort capitulated on terms after a seige of five months. Its fall was a severe blow to the prestige of the Sultan, who thus lost the last fortified place in the interior which was well disposed to him while ils possession opened up a new sphere of influence to the rebel party. Saiyid Taimur had been anxious to obtain the assistance of British troops in the 'autumn and had previously asked whether, if he could raise a force of some 2,000 or 3,000 men, the Government would assist him in attacking his enemy. Indeed, he had not been anxious to move without such help but cir cumstances and the importunity of those around him had led him to take action which, in. its result, showed his absolute helplessness to meet alone the situation in which he was placed. In the month of May the Political Agent forwarded to the Deputy Political Eesident a scheme for the better Government of Oman and for the provision of a force for the Sultan by means of which order could be obtained. The main features of the present situation are as follows ;— The rebels, who may fairly claim to have caused a revolution rather than to have raised a rebellion, are in complete control of the interior of Oman and it is only the existence of the Indian Regiment at Muttra and the presence of His Majesty's ships which prevents them extending that control to Muscat and the rest of the coast line of Oman. They have never acknowledged the present Sultan whose dignity they consider to be, under the rules of their religious constitution, an elective and not a hereditary position The movement, though partly due to the objection of the Hinawis to the present branch of the Abu Said family is also due to three generations of bad and weak rule. This condition of affairs the present Sultan has shown no sign of desiring to improve. While the Government of the Imam is making obvious efforts to rule well according to their lights, and every attempt is made to enforce justice in His Highness' country, the complaints which are made have only too much foundation as will be seen from the notes on his Administration. The Omanis and the people of the coast hold the British GoTernment responsible for his bad rule since, so they say, if it were not for this support they would not be obliged to undergo it. The Sultan is now so absolutely dependent upon us that an unvarnished exposition of the situation to him would leave him no alternative but to reform were that made a condition of our continued support of him. Owing to the lack of officials referred to elsewhere there would appear to be no alternative to the employment of British trained officials in the re-oiganisation of his system. As stated above His Highness' administration leaves much to he desired Administration of His Highnw tho Sultan. A 011 !? 11 te lias made considerable improye- ment in the disposal of cases of British subjects. Unfortunately such improvement is only maintained under continual pressure for the whole system is at fault. His Highness has no Wazir and no Minister of any kind. It is obviously impossible for him to do all the work himself and he does not appear to under stand that a State requires somew T hat more organisation than that which is re- sufficient for the village of a small Arab Shaikh. For many years the Sultans have been obliged, owing to the ignorance and want cf education of the native material at their disposal, to use Indians for the control of the Customs and lor Secretarial work connected with finance and w ith India, and it is this difficulty which makes it practically impossible to suggest any method of improvement from within, the more so since those 'who might assist him to rule on purely Arab lines are opposed to his very existence m any form of authority. Xlis TV alis in the districts, most of them members of the ruling family&gt; arf* unreliable and their rule is bad 8m FOR THE YEAH 1917. 43 There has been some trouble at Khaburah. owing to the fact that the Wall had been charging illegal dues and bad misappropriated money which he had received on behalf of British subjects. The Sultan has righted the complaints for the moment and, should they recur, application will be made for the Wali to be removed. His Highness considers him one of his best men. The outstanding question of His Highness' administration is his indebted- uess, which amounts ( to at least 5 lakhs of rupees. iSaiyid Taimur keeps no accounts and, as his receipts and expenditure are never balanced, he has no idea of what he is spending. Thus his debts increase steadily and, unless some reforms are made, bankruptcy is the inevitable result; indeed, the terms upon which he is now borrowing show that such a condition cannot be far cff. His cheques are not accepted unless drawn upon or guaranteed by the Customs and they are usually only accepted at a discount of 40 per cent, on their face value. | Muhammad Puad, a Turk, who was employed by His Highness in the | | training of his Nizam and who had for some years been objected to, was dis missed on the demand of the Political Agent. After failing to get permission to remain at Basrah or proceei to Baghdad he was, on his return to Karachi, arrested and interned. Similarly, one Muhammad Tahnoon, His Highness' Agent at Lingah, had heen for some years the subject of adverse comment and of representations to His Highness. At the request of th^, Political Agent he was dismissed and replaced by Khwaja Ahmad bin Yusuf who was in good repute with the Vice-Consul at Lingah. The Customs Department in Muscat and Muttra continued throughout Cas f 0ms the year under the charge of the Snperin' tendent, Mr. Muhammad Pieimoo, an A^lia Khani Khoja, and a British Indian subject, who has for many years doi.e business in Gwadur, where he has amassed some fortune. He has also been, and is still, the farmer of the Gwadur Customs on behalf of His Highness. Muhammad Reimoo has considerably improved the management of the Customs Department in keeping definite records, but the system by which the Customs is the Sultan's Bank still continues, with the result that the adminis- jtration is steeped in debt and for the Spring and Monsoon months can only Cpntinue by borrowing money from local merchants in order to pay the family pensions and other charges with which it is burdened. The Customs Superin tendent is able to make use of his position to benefit himself in his trade. Under the Treaty of 1891 with Great Britain only 5 per cent, import tax can be charged, but the charge is made in dollars at a fixed rate of exchange ; consequently, with the appreciated value of the dollar, British subjects have been paying*in actual fact as much as 8 per cent., though nominally paying but 5 per cent. The Sur Customs, which should give big returns to His Highness, has been brought under the Muscat control but, owing to the system of exemption, local liaud and limited authority of the Sultan over that part of the country, a tithe only of the revenues which he should receive is ever paid into his coffers.

On 28th of May the 108th Infantry was relieved by the 3rd Brabmans from Mesopotamia. On the ^Oth tlie 108th Infantry proceeded to Basrah. In February an excellent road from Muttra to Bait-ul-Falaj was made by the 108th Infantry, and transport carts were obtained to replace the coolies who had hitherto carried all baggage and stores. An Inland Water Transport Officer was appointed to Muscat in Feb ruary, and an oil barge was anchored at Muttra Harbour to supply sbips^ of the Inland Water Transport en route to Basrah. During a cyclone off the Dhofar coast, in the month of June, an Inlaiid Water Transport Tug, No. S. T.-21, parted company with a Refrigerator Barge it was towing. The Refrigerator Barge ran ashore on the mainland nearKas Sideri 3 some distance below Mashireh Island, but ^he Tug was never heard of again. The crew of the ' Refrigerator,' consisting of seven men, were brought off by two friendly Arabs and, after travelling for a week across country, obtained a dhow and were finally landed at Muscat. But the barga and all it contained was looted by the Bedouins. Some rifles, which were on board, reached the interior of Oman for sale at the end of the year. Brigadier-General Douglas, Commanding at Bushire, visited Muscat on inspection on the 15th June and the 2nd November. On the 6th September His Excellency Vice-Admiral E. F, A.

She had been unable to make Djibouti in the monsoon and arrived at Muscat with no water and ii but a few tons of coal left. Owing to the sanitary conditions of the ship and, fearing an epidemic, the [l Political Agent decided to have the troops landed. The French Consul agreed and a camp was pitched by the 3rd Brahmans at Darsait, 3 miles from Muscat, where the French troops were accommodated till the arrival of a French ship 'La Loire on the 28th July. The troops embarked and left on the 29th having lost 9 men with heat stroke during their stay at Muscat. American Mission, The Rev. F.

Though there was no^ epidemic the health of Muscat was bad.

The Postmaster was invalided and, after the close of the year, the Head Clerk of this Agency has followed suit. In all cases the cause has been the same and has been responsible for much wastage among the native ranks. Signs of hook worm have since been observed, and investigations are being made as to whether this is not responsible for a large part of the sickness. L.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT FOR THE BAHRAIN AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1917. Charge of the Political Agency was held by Captain P. G. Loch through- p er80nne] out the year. Assistant Surgeon Monani returned from nine months' sick leave on September 15th, and Assistant Surgeon A. J. Kapasi returned to India. Relations with Shaikh ' Isa have continued satisfactory with the exception j a i irv. rr u v* -i ^ w0 m 3tters. One was an endeavour Shaikh 'Isa and A1 Khahfah iamily. ^ .i i £ ou *1 u jt x on the part of Shaikh Isa to assert his longed for right of jurisdiction over Hasawis and Najdis. In this case the rudder of a sailing boat belonging to an Hasawi was seized by the Shaikh's order to put pressure on the man in connection with a debt. On representations being made to Shaikh ' Isa he somewhat reluctantly restored the rudder and the case was dealt with in the Political Agent's Court. The Shaikh brought up the question of jurisdiction but it Mas explained to him that the matter had, as he knew, been referred to the Government of India, that, owing to their war pre-occupations they had no leisure to deal with it at the present time and that he must in the meantime refrain from upsetting the existing state of affairs. The second matter was the imprisonment of two Persians for over a week by the Amir (head official) of Muharraq by order of the Shaikh. The Shaikh was away when this was brought to the notice of the Political Agent and the Amir refused to send the two men over to the Agency ; on being strongly pressed, however, he did so. The Shaikh was asked to furnish an immediate explanation of the occurrence and stated that he had issued the order on the eve of going out on a hunting expedition and had forgotton about the men. About the same time the release of a negress from the lock up of the Amir of Manamah had to be demand ed. A frank discussion of the incidents has led to complete understanding and it is hoped that no further cases of the kind will take place. Shaikh Hamad, the nominated successor of Shaikh ' Isa, has been friendly and seems to be taking rather more interest in affairs than formerly. Shaikh Abdullah, C.I.E., the third son of Shaikh 'Isa, often does busi ness on behalf of his father. He is very intelligent and a thoroughly nice person to deal with ; much of the present smoothness of relations between the Agency and the Shaikh is due to him. Assistant Surgeon A. J. Kapasi was in charge of the Hospital from January to September 14th, and Assistant victoria Memorial Hospital. Surgeon G. K. Monani from September 15th to the end of the year. The numbers of cases treated as compared with the two previous years, are as follows :— Tear. In-doors. Out-doors.

The Assistant Sur- piague and Quarantine. geon in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital carried out the duties of the Quarantine Medical Officer in addition to his own duties during the year. In March an epidemic of plague broke out which lasted till June there were 1,393 deaths from plague of which ten were of persons who had been48 ANNUAL EEPORT BY THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL BESIDENCT inoculated. The number of people inoculated during this epidemic was 1051 as compared with 781 in 1915 and 93 in 1911 ' ' Steps were taken to clean the town of Manamah and the mat roofs of the bazaar, which were filthy beyond description, were removed. These measures had a good effect and resulted in the death rate of Manamah being far below that of Muharraq Island. The existence of the wireless telegraph has been a great blessing, as the wireless station ^ been . Ter y i^guiar'and the Reuters summaries have been of much value for spreading war news. Billg ,. ud Friendly correspondence on m i ttor matters and giving news has been ketit up with Bin Sa'ud. On November 14th Mr. H. St. J. Philby's Mission proceeded to Riadh. The Hasa-Eiadh route is fairly safe—two caravans were looted by tribes Hasa and Qatif, hostile to Bi n Sa' ud in February, but the lost goods w T ere recovered. The Political Agent's visit to the Amir of Qatif has placed relations on a personal basis with happy results. The value of such visits cannot be overrated and it is hoped that in the future there will be more opportunity for making them. q atar Friendly correspondence has been car ried on regarding minor matters but nothing of importance occurred. Qadhi Shaikh Qasim bin Mahzah, the chief Sunni Qadhi, has tried a large Local Officials and the Majlis. number of cases at the Political Agent's . request; his decisions are extremely good and quick and he has a genius for extracting evidence from the extraordinarily untruthful witnesses produced in Bahrain. Qadhi Shaikh Khalaf, the Shi'ah Qadhi, was dismissed by Shaikh 'Isa for corruptness and injustice in January and Qadhi Shaikh Salman bin Ahmad al Asrur has been appointed in his stead. He seems a rather colourless individual Muhammad bin Fadhal, Judge of the Salifat-al-Ghaus (Pearling Court)' as dealt with cases quickly and fairly well; he is, however, much under the thumbs of the pearling: fraternity and it is often difficult to get justice for a diver. It is hoped eventually to establish a court of three or four reputable men at the head of the pearling trade who, though in the trade themselves, wiL not permit too gross injustice to be perpetrated by one of their number.

A large sum has been subscribed by British Indians, Persians, and Arabs for the re-construction and extension of CuSl0m8, the Customs pier which is well on its way to completion. The work has been carried out very satisfactorily by Mr. V. T. Maharaj, Director of Customs. Owing to the shortage of shipping and also heavy exporting on the quiet T1 . , . to Kuwait, the prices of food and other i ixed prices or loodBtufts. • •, x necessaries became very high m Novem ber. In consultation with Shaikh 'Isa the prices of all necessities of life were fixed and the merchants warned that, if any further wild exporting took place, notlnLg would be allowed to leave the Islands except under permit. On the whole, the merchants co-operated well but the question is a difficult one as about one-third of the goods brought to Bahrain is re-exported to the mainland ; if goods are only available in smaller quantities than are ordinarily imported, it will be hard to ensure the mainland getting its correct proportion. Card indexing, fractional referencing and other labour saving devices are being introduced into the office and Umce enici0ncy. (3 01^ ft The urgent necessity for the provision of clerks' quarters at Bahrain has been well demonstrated in the last quarter of the year. I he Head Clerk's lease terminated and the ow r ner of the house refused to renew it as he w ished to occupy the house himself. As soon as it was known that the Agency w T as look ing out for accommodation prices were put up; one small and inadequate building of which the normal rent wns P^s. 15 was put up to Rs. 50 a month and the owners refused to sell, though the house was in the market; it had previously been hoped to buy it and adapt it to the needs of the Head Clerk. Otherwise there was nothing to be had at all; even before the rents were raised against the Agency, no suitable house could be had at less than double the bouse allowance of Rs. 20. The question has been settled temporarily by ^r. Pack of M. Rosenthal et Freres kindly consenting to sub-let his house, which he ordinarily leaves locked up, to the Head Clerk on condition that he vacates it on receiving a telegram that any member of the firm is coming. . • By the courtesy of the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, the second clerk is permitted to 'chum ' with the Wireless Staff, but there is only room for bun while the Wireless Staff are without their wives.

ADMINISTRATION EEPORT FOR THE KUWAIT AGENCY EOR THE YEAR 1917. There are no signs of retardation in the growth of material prosperity of General this town as noticed in last year's report. On the contrary, the ratio of improve ment has increased and this is due chiefly to two causes, greater demands in Central Arabia for foodstuffs and piece-goods, whose other markets have been closed as a result of the war, and an exceptionally brisk trade with Persian ports. A good pearling season &gt;vas also a contributing factor. Kuwait is one of those places, which, far from feeling any bad effects from these world-wide hostilities, has actually grown richer and happier. Pearl merchants often sigh for the close of the war, hoping that this will put up the price of the gems to their pre-war figures, but the catch has been good, prices none too bad and they have little to complain of. There have been no failures among them. Towards the end of the year the British India Steam Navigation Company resumed their fortnightly service, a boon which has been greatly appreciated by the Shaikh and people. Two regrettable incidents mark the year 1917. His Excellency Shaikh Jahiras -Subah, C.S.I., died on February 5th, after a short illness from acute gastritis. He w T as a very debonair and pleasant gentleman whose mildness and affability made him a popular ruler. The other misfortune w T as an unprece- dectedly severe epidemic of small-pox, which has caused the death of several thousand persons up to the present time. Shaikh Jabir w-as succeeded by his younger brother Salim-al-Mubarak, himself a man of over fifty. A very different type of man from his brother, he is a stern Muhammadan and an uncomprising ruler. Not content with maintaining order in the town. Shaikh Salim has taken steps to secure the frontiers of his territory on the desert side and to regain the influence among $16 Bedouins which his father, the late Sir Mubarak, formerly weilded. Lieutenant-Colonel R. E. A. Hamilton, Political Agent, proceeded on a jspecial mission to Nejd. Leaving Kuwait on October 12th, he travelled first to Zilfi and after visiting the towns of Boraidah, Anaizeh, Mudhnib and Shakra, in all of which he had an excellent reception, arrived at Riadh in the middle of November. He remained there for three weeks as the guest of the Imam Abdulaziz bin Saud, and thence returned by the Hafar-al-Ats-al-Habba route on December 28th. During the year 4,700 camels, 19,975 sheep, 1,111 cattle, and 3.000 tons stores, were purchased in Kuwait for the Supplies to the Expeditionary Force. Commissariat Department. Zaid Budai, a lo(jal merchant, purchased the sheep and cattle, and Abdulaziz bin Hasan the camels. Both men have rendered conspicuous services to Government during the war. The Shaikh fell in with the w r ishes of Government in furnishing native craft for the conveyance of foodstuffs from India to Basrah. 2,500 tons of cargo-space was thus reserved for ships going to India wdth dates and return ing with grain.

Formerly 4 per cent, was exacted on everything except gold ace and tobacco, which was paid 10 per cent. At the same time export duty was abolished, except on goods brought in from the interior, such as wool, gnee. hides, etc., which continued subject to 4 per cent, duty it exported.

'Juno,' ' Philomel,' 'Lawrence,^ 'Bramble,' ' Pyramus/' Britomart, ' ' Mozaffir ' and the armed launch ' Azerbaijan, ' the Squadron being divided equally between North and South as in 1916. All along the coasts the situation remained peaceful, and in January ' Juno' came South owing to the possibility of raiders approaching the Gulf. At the end of January H. M. S. ' Philomel ' was detached from the Squadron, and went home to pay-ofE. On 22nd February it was found necessary to move all ships except ' Mozaffir ^ South for escort and patrol duties, and this disposition continued until the commencement of June, when patrol and escort was abandoned. On 2Uth April the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia were combined as one command under Rear- Admiral' Drury St. A. Wake, C B.. C.I.E. The Persian Gulf Division was orga- ized on similar lines as before, i.e., with a senior officer in the Northern and Southern .. i -n. i parts, and Mesopotamia under a senior officer. In August H. M. S. ' Pjramus e t e Rear-Admiral making Basrah his head- staticn. quarters. The Mesopotamian Division consisted of H. M. S. 'Dalhousie' (with Rear-Admiral's 'Proserpine,^ Alert, ^ and twenty-two gunboats with H. M.S. ' Scotstoun' as Repair-ship. On 24th June Rear-Admiral Ernest F. A. Gaunt, C.B., C M.G., relieved Vice-Admiral Sir Rosslyn E. Wemyss, K.C.B., C.M.G., M.V.O., in command of the East Indies Squadron. A 'light disturbance occurred at Lingah due to the arbitrary conduct of a Mullah, but a visit bv the Rear-Admiral in H. M. S. 'Lawrence' and subsequent visits from one or two vessels stopped all further trouble and later on the Mullah was removed by His Excellency Darya Begi, and deported. . T . A wireless telegraph station has now been erected at Lingah. With the above exception the inhabitants of the Coast Ports have been quite peace able. The utility of visits of men -of-war to these ports was emphasized by the rumours that spread in consequence of the absence of the squadron on patrol and escort work-^ , a report from Lingah stated that H. M, S. 'Juno' had been sunk by the Germans in consequence of the measures taken by her on the Shibkuh coast in the previous year ! The French Government godown has been lent temporarily to the British., and is now used for the storage of oil in tins for the Inland Water Transport vessels proceeding to Basrah. This is a great convenience. Heniam is beino- largely used for bunkering transports from and to Basrah, and when the pier i^eomj™eted its utility as a. ooal depot will be greatly inereased Two new tanks have been constructed, and these should solve the difficulty of the water supply. The Island of Kharag, to the northward of Bushire, has become of much importance in providing large quantities of very good stone to Basrah. Excellent relations exist between the inhabitants and the British. A temporary wireless telegraph station has been erected on the Island. ^ His Excellency Bear-Admiral E. F, A. Gaunt, C.B., C.M.G., visited the Pers.an Gulf and Mesopotamia between 6th September and 28th September 191 7, Heajam, Bnshire, Basrah, Bandar Abbas, Jasl and K.shm in H.M.b. No.thbrook.

Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., C.I.E., D.S.O., officiated for him at Baghdad. Mr. J. H. Bill, I C.S., continued to hold the post of Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty's Acting Consul-General, Bushire, throughout the year. Major M. E. Rae was First Assistant Resident throughout. Mr. Vice-Consul Worrall held the post of Second Assistant Resident until 20th January, when he was relieved by Captain H. J. C.

Chick, C.I.E., was in charge of the Vice-Consulate until he proceeded on leave to England, on 23rd May. He was succeeded by Mr. Vice-Consul Worrall, and Major H. C. Pulley was specially employed in corresponding and maintaining our relations with the local Khans, until he was attached to the Bushire Force as Assistant Political Officer, on September 28th. Major J. McPherson, I.M.S., was Residency Surgeon and Chief Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. Lieutenant-Colonel H. A. K.

This year has seen great, and, it is to be hoped, decisive changes in this region. Events here showed a certain Conditions in Bushire Hinterland and on the correspondence with the COUl'Se of the sinra? roa (L European war. The opening of the year found the same chaotic conditions prevailing as were described in last years report. Coincident with the apparent success of the German thrust, in March and April, came a vigorous development of intrigue against the South Persia Rifles, organised in Tehran. The principal efforts of the intriguers were directed towards the undermining of discipline in the Corps, and towards inducing Soulet-ed-Douleh, the Ilkhani of the Kashgai, to come out in open opposition to the Governor-General and the pro^British party. Opening, in April, with several cases of desertion, due entirely to political causes, the campaign of agitation next centred on the Kashgai tribe, whose migration is normally in full progress by the end of that month. In the course of the month of May, Soulet-ed-Douleh, then Ilkhani, came out openly against the British, and began a regular 'Jehad'' campaign ; and, on May 25th, the post at Khaneh Zinian, 27 miles from Shiraz, was treacherously surrendered by the South Persia Rifles to a mixed force of Kashgais and Kazerunis; CaptainFOR THE YEAR 191 8, 3 Will, in command, and Sergeant Ooomber being brutally murdered. On the same date, however, the Kashgais were defeated by a force of Indian troops, the casualties being estimated at 600 for the enemy as against 51 on our side, and the situation to some extent relieved. Active hostilities continued, however, throughout June, culminating on June 20th, when the enemy reached their greatest strength in the valley. On this date their forces in the Shiraz plain were estimated at 1,810, in occupation of various positions on the West and North of Shiraz. A.I the same time the internal situation in the city of Shiraz was far from satisfactory, and Qawam-ul-Mnlk for a short time was evidently wavering. Sir P. Sykes, with the South Persia Rifles, and approxi mately 2,500 Lndian troops, maintained his defence until July 7th, when a column was sent out to Chenar Rahdar, before which Soulet-ed-Douleb beat a hasty retreat. Meanwhile preparations w r ere made at Bushire for the formation of a force to take decisive action in the autumn. The construc tion of a Tramway from Bushire, begun in July, w r as taken by all concerned ' as a definite indication that the British Government had decided to deal effectively with the perplexing problems of Ears. The formation of the force continued throughout July and August, during which two months the situa tion in France was transformed in favour of the Allies. The rebel chiefs of the Bushire Hinterland first showed their uneasiness as early as June 20th, when they enquired the object of the British Govern ment in landing additional troops, and w r ere informed that this was due to the hostile acts of Soulet-ed-Douleh and Nasir-i-Diwan. They returned to the charge on August 21ith, with a statement that the railway, if con structed, would threaten ' their independence '. This letter was handed to the Darya Begi, who sent a suitable reply. By September 21st they had collected a force of about 300 men at Ohaghadak, 11 miles from Bushire, the three leaders, Ghazanfar-es-Sultaneh of Borasjun, Shaikh Hussain of Chah- kutah, and Zair Khidhar of Tangistan, being present in person. On September 25th telegraphic orders were received by the Governor from the Prime Minister, directing him to afford every assistance to the British troops in their task in opening the road, constructing the railway and establishing order ; he was also directed to punish severely any persons opposing this friendly enterprise, A proclamation containing these orders w r as at once published, and the rebel leaders strongly urged by the Governor in a separate letter to come in to him and receive the orders of their Government, a guarantee against the death penalty and imprisonment being given. They refused to come in, and made highly suspicious proposals for an interview about four miles in front of the advanced posts. An alternative proposal for a meeting 1J miles out, in view of our posts, was rejected by them, though they sent in as an envoy a notorious agitator, formerly a, bankrupt merchant of Bashire, Mirza Ali Kazeruni. The envoy began by asking the price placed by the British Government on his services, and when these had been rejected admitted that his employers had no intention of obeying any orders given them by any Persian authority, and would under no circusmtances permit the construc tion of the railway without a fighf, as such construction would be fatal to their privileged position. When asked the Khans' reason for refusing to obey the Prime Minister's orders, he replied contemptuously 'No one knows what Tehran is, now-a-days'. He was consequently directed to return immediately to his employers, and warn them that unless they immediately evacuated their positions, they would be responsible for any bloodshed which might ensue. This closed the period of negotiation, and the following morning the trenches at Ohaghadak were attacked and captured by a force commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. Corlett, 15th Lancers, and co uposed as under : — ' A ' Squadron, 15th Lancers. Bushire I. M. A. Section. Detachment 54!th S. and M. 2-113th Infantry (800 rifles).4 ANNUAL REPOET Of THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY 1 Section No. 3 M. G. Company.

The evacuation of the trenches developed into a complete route, Ghazan far-es-Sultaneh in particular riding without drawing rein 27 miles to'Borasiu ' This was the only attempt made by the rebel chiefs of the maritime reio 1 ' to withstand troops in the field, although there was a certain amount cf sniping at night. The enemy force at Chaghadak was found to have increased to 600 men, and 29,000 rounds of ammunition were captured. From Septem ber 29th the period of active military operations opened ; the General Officer Commanding, Bushire Force, assumed political charge of the sphere of opera tions, with the Deputy Political Resident as Chief Political Officer, and the Political staff was gradually strengthened by the deputation from the Mesopotamian Field Force of the following officers : Major H. C. Pulley 12th Pioneers, who had already been on special duty under the Deputy Political Resident for three months, Lieutenant-Colonel E. G. Gregson, C M G C .I.E., and Captain D, M. Fraser, Central India Horse. The Chaghadak Field Column rapidly developed into the Striking Force, commanded by Brigadier- General A. M. S. Elsmie, C .M.G., the final composition of which, on Noven^ ber 24th, was as follows:— Staff— 1 Squadron, 15th Lancers. 1 Section, 23rd Mountain Battery I. M. A, 2 Sections 35th „ s} 3rd Indian Machine Gun Company. 54th Company Sappers and Miners. l-55th Coke's Rifles. I-i 17th Mahrattas. l-127th Baluch Light Infantry. Trench Motor Battery, The first task of the force was obviously the occupation of the home; ol the rebel chiefs and their replacement by others. Accordingly Chahkutah was occupied on October 9th, and Shaikh Abdullah installed in place of Shaikh Rnssain, on October 15th; Ahram, on October 19th, and Borasjun, !r^ . f, re P! acen } ent of Zair Khidhar at Ahram presented ( i icu lies owing to the epidemic of influenza then raging, which entirely presented the engagement of local tufangchis to support the authority of the new ruler when mstaLed. Eventually the appointment was conferred upon • a f S fi ri /i n0 ^i ^ e . ^ as ^.^ ere( ^ ai T of Tangistan, and he was mis a e , on m ember 9th ; Zair Khidhar, who had meanwhile re-occupied the p ace, emg is odged 'without fighting.

It sGcmGd GvidGnt tliat the condition of GxilG } though, not parti' cularly objcciionablG to tliG rGbel leaders thenisGlvGS, -was very 0 much disliked by their iollowGrs, who naturally regarded with apprehension the prospect of being left to the tender mercies of the succeeding chiefs. At the same time, it was quite impossible to hope for the maintenance of decent coiiditions on the road, if any of these hardened offenders were allowed to return to their posts. These considerations rendered nugatory all hope of any direct settle ment with the rebel chiefs, who had to be forced to unconditional surrender to the Persian Government. The next stage of the advance, from Daliki to Charum, led through difficult and mountainous country, the inhabitants of which were known to be mainly friendly, although there was a certain measure of anxiety regarding the attitude of the Kashgai sections whose -winter quarters lie near the road^ The main difficulty of the advance lay in the construction of a road passable for camels through the Jb'iltiili Pass close to Daliki, and up the more formidable Kotal-i-Mallu on to the Khisht plain. On November 14th General Elsmie, accompanied by the Deputy Political Resident, reconnoitred the Khisht plain, spending the night at Konar Takhteh. The party was everywhere well received and entertained by Baba Khan, headman of Konar Takhteh, and by Ali Wais Khan and Sardar 'Khan, the joint Kalantars of Khisht. These two parties were then, mutually hostile, as Baba Khan was a dependent of Nur Muhammad Khan of Daliki, a bitter enemy of the Khisht chiefs, whose territory he had more than once ravaged. The Khisht plain was a good example of the complete chaos into which this part of Persia had fallen. N^o rent or revenue had been paid for years, but the chiefs were impoverished by the incessant expenditure on cartridges, and by the actual damage done to property during their recurrent quarrels. The re connaissance was completed by a return to Daliki through the alternative route of the gorge of the Shapur river, and the Kotal-i-Bur. This is an old route which w T ould repay study as a possible route for the railway, avoiding as it does both the Filfilli and Mallu passes. It would, how r ever, require a bridge over, the Daliki river, which is often impassable at this point- On the 17th November, Nur Muhammad Khan and his brother were arrest ed in consequence of some heavy sniping near the Daliki bridge in his territory. Investigation revealed no direct evidence implicating him, but it was generally considered, notably by the Governor of Bushire, that it could not have taken place without his connivance, as his three nephews were all in the hills near by, w r atching events. The brothers were accordingly removed from Daliki to Bushire, and the son of the former headman, Kal Ali, appointed in place of Nur Muhammad. This and all other appointments were made by the Governor of Bushire, and confirmed where necessary by the Governor- General of Pars. In considering all these cases it is necessary to remember tliat Ghazanfar-es-Sultaneh alone of all the headmen removed from their posts, had any hereditary right to his position, all the others being either forcible usurpers, or more temporary agents appointed by non-resident owners. Ihus Nur Muhammad Khan is a Borasjuni by birth, and owed his position at Daliki to appointment by Nizam-es-Sultaneh, the owner of the village, and his importance solely to the wealth acquired by him from exactions on the mule traffic. As a result of the arrest of Nur Muhammad, his adherents, Baba Khan and Ghulam Eeza, absconded from Konar Takhteh, being replaced by their cousin Mullah Fathull^, whose father had formally been headman. He proved a very satisfactory choice. The next period, until December 20th, was occupied w 7 ith roadmaking and preparations for the attack on the formidable Kamarij Pass, where oj^posi- tion on the part of Nasir-i-Dewan the rebel headman of Kazerun, w-as expo: ! ~ 7 During this period t a'O attacks were made on picquetting troops, and as a result the country to the right of the advance was explored by three columns, and the village of Jamileh burnt. During all this time the heaa of the Kamarij Pass was reported held by Kazerunis under the Farrash Bashi, theANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY {aHAS' i principal supporter of Nasir i-Dewan, but when the actual attack was made he was not found present, and the enemy were led by Mullah Ewaz, Nasir-i. Dewan's nominee as headman of Kamarij. The attack was well covered by th« mountain guns, and most of the enemy ran away Ijetore the attack \vas fully developed. A few men, however, held their ground wuh great pertinacity till the 55tli Coke's Rifles effected an ascent of an almost precipitous side path, ami appeared on the summit, at which point they lost one man killed and one wounded. Kamari] was then occupied, and entrusted to Mulla Quli, a^ guardian of the infant son of Haidar lihan, the last headman of Kamaiij v\ho was success ful in maintaining good order in the \alley, ilic capture of t^e Kamavij Pass ended auv possibility of resistance to the progiess ot our tioops to Shiraz, and the military problems confronting the force were hencefoith confined to admin istrative matters, roadmaking, the saieguarding of the Lines of Communica tion, and such subsidiary measures as were from time to ime found necessary to keep the rebel leaders well out of reach of the road. At the close of the year the Governor was engaged in organising an attack by local riflemen on Zair Khidar's position at Khawiz. Thus the year closed with the hostile organisation completely broken as far as Kazerun, and the town open to occupation at any moment. From Bushire to the foot of the Kamarij Pass a good camel road had been construct ed ; and the hostile chiefs were fugitives in the bills with only a petty follow- ing. The political 2Kobiems presented by the situation were even at thfs stage complicated and embarrassing, the Political officers being confronted at every turn with questions of an administrative charac ter, and being obliged by their instructions to avoid the assumption or any powers beyond those immediately necessary for the purposes of the force, and to evade all commitments which would place difficulties in the way of a return to Persian administration. It will readily be imagined that this task was not an easy one in a tract where no settled government had been seen for years, and where the keenest desire of the inhabitants was to see a strong authority established to decide all their vexed questions. A feature of the expedition, whielvof incalculable value on the political side, was its remarkable degree of incfependence of local resources in the matter of supply and transport The Persians early realised that neither they, their animals, nor their supplies were in any sense indispensable to the expedition, and this feeling naturally made them far more confident, and at the same time less grasping, in their dealings with the force, than would otherwise have been the case. As a result of this and of tactful handling by Political and Supply officers, local supply was effectively organised, and provided the following totals to the end of the vear : — Sheep and goals Camels . Bhoosa Firewood Barley Wheat Dates 2,515 82 6,652 maunds, 6,412 „ 103 „ 120 „ 101 The total British casualties to the end of the vear were as follows :— British officers British other ranks Indian officers x Indian other ranks Followers Total Killed. Wounded. Died of wouuds. 17 17 1 56 5S Died of disease. 1 1 .1 275 120 400A FOR TOE YEAR 1918. 7 It should be noted that these figures include tl e casualties due to tlie world -wide epidemic of influenza. The history of the expedition during the period under review appears to justify the following conclusions : — firstly, the large majority of the inhabitants of Southern Pcisia aie absolutely sick of disorder and insecurity. This feeling, enlorced by the weak ness due to the ravages of the influenza, and the difliculty of obtaining fresh supplies of ammunition, and especially by the collapse of the German power, broke the back of the ami-British coalition animated by Wassmuss. Secondly, the traditional Persian fear of artillery fire, which had been slightly weakened in this region owing to the ineffective' nature of the artillery occasionally brought out by the Persian authorities, was found to be as strong as ever as soon as the effectiveness of t#ie fire was perceived. Thirdly, the local villagers and tribesmen, though no doubt they would be led by their religious and patriotic feelings to view a Biitish defeat with pleasure, are not actuated by these feelings to any practical extent as soon as the British are in force : there is no reluctance whatever to enter into friendly and even cordial relations. Fourthly, the influence of the Tehran Government may be described as almost entirely negative. None of the leading men has (or had hitherto) the slightest compunction in disobeying orders either from the Provincial or the Central Government, or in withholding revenue ; and the prospect of the appointment of local Persian authorities was nowhere welcome. At the same time opposition to the British expedition w r ould unquestionably have been intensified in the absence of any proclamation from the Prime Minister. Wassmuss went to Kazerun at the commencement of the agitation, but n ... does not appear to have been verv warmlv lierman activities. -1 i -.i i xt • • 1^ 1 welcomed, either by Nasir-i-Dewan or by Soulet. He was not present at any of the fighting near Shiraz. Under the orders of Government he and Oertel were informed of the conclusion of the Armistice and offered the following conditions , viz., immediate repatriation if they came in at once, in the alternative treatment as prisoners of w T ar if they were captured later. They sent prevaricating replies, and did not come in. The matter was not of great importance, as Wassmuss' influence had practically disappeared. The events at Shiraz itself during the summer have already been described. 0 .. , „ Previous to the rising in May, several Sh?raz and Fars. P , ... 3 _ L . , , success! ul punitive operations had been carried out to the East and North of Shiraz. Simultaneously with the attacks on ShiraZj detached posts at Abadeh and Dchbid w T ere invested. The former was in very serious danger, which w r as only averted by a vary stubborn defence. Negotiations for its relief were undertaken w r ith the Bakhtiari Khans, but it was relieved in time by a column from Shiraz. During the operations against Soulet -ed -Douleh he was superseded as Ilkhani of the Kashgai by his half brother, Sardar Ehtisham. The latter conducted a campaign against him in the autumn, with the assistance of a force of Indian troops and South Persia Kifles, without whom he would undoubtedly have been unable to accomplish anything. They succeeded in driving him away from his headquarters at Piruzabad with heavy loss, but their operations were paralysed by the influenza epidemic, which decimated the column, and they were unable to continue the campaign. Soulet was, however, rendered quite impotent to affect the progress of the Bushire force The situation was transformed in this quarter by the expedition of the _ .. Bakhtiari Khans, with the invaluable Eehbehan and Kuhgiiu. assistance of a section of the 31st Moun tain Battery, against the rebellious chiefs of the Kuhgiiu, which took place in June with complete success, the two forts of Lindeh and Baisi, previously considered impregnable, being easily captured. A detailed description of the campaign will be found in the Ahwaz report.8 ANNUAL REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GTJLF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The affairs of the Boir ^hmadi Garmsiri on the other hand took a serious turn for tlie worse. In April the Deputy Polilical Resident, while visitin® Eehbehan, on tour in company with Mr. Chick, was met by the two brothers' Nasrullph Khan and MuzafiferuJlah Khan, at Zeidun, and warmly invited to visit their home at Aru. The visit passed ofl very weil, and on the retura journey the Khans came in to Behbehan, and Nasrullah Khan, for the first time for ye^rs, paid liis land revenue. Ho then insisted on coming on to Bushire, ostensibly for medical treatment, but mainly for amusement. b After a few days at Busbire he proceeded to Mohammerah on a visit to the Shaikh and was met there by the nt?ws that Ins brother had treacherously seized his fort in his absence and turned out his family. He spent the rest of 'the year in endeavouring to regain his fort by force or intrigue, but the Bakhtiari Khans after promising him every assistance, were bought oyer by his brother and nothing was done. * The friendly Khans were of course delighted at the course or events in , , tl!e hinterland, and were lavish in offers Tie Haiyat Daud cotuederacy. l * i „ vu - CJa ol aimed assistance, which was of course not required. There were no events of importance in this tract. Here also the Bushire operations produced an excellent effect, and it became possible to post Customs officials in several ports from which they had in Prrsi.m Htttfr.il South of BusLire. the past been consistently ejected.

The first cases of cholera discovered here were noted on the 11th ipril among the Turki immigrants, some of whom had been accommodated in buildings in the town. (In mid February it was reported that cholera was present 3 farsakhs from Shiraz.) With the assistance of the Deputy Governor, sick and contacts were evacuated into huts and the buildings disinfected. The measures taken brought the local epidemic to a prompt termination. In the middle of May the disease was reported from the neighbourhood o^ Yezd, and from the environs of Shiraz, it was officially reported in June, where it attacked the South Persia Eifles. In August, cholera was stated to prevail six stages out on the Bandar Abbas road, and quarantine measures against arrivals from the interior were in action until earlv in September. Influenza arrived in Bushire on 4th October and was responsible for about *.,000 deaths. Influenza also appeared in Lingah, in November, while at Bandar Abbas, in July, an illness of influenzal type was prevalent. In Bandar Abbas, measles was prevalent in Spring ard later, diarrho6aj dysentery and fever made the health of that town indiffe- ent till May. At Debai, in June, an epidemic which appeared to be cholera was responsible for many deaths.ANNUAL liEPORT OF THE PEKSIAN GULF POLITICAL EESIDENCr CHAPTER II.

Howson, O.B.E., with the penonal rank of Consul, held charge of the Vice-Consulate from the beginning of the year up to 10th October, the day on which ) e died in Bombay from influenza. Erom 10th October till 6th December the duties of the V^ice-Consulate were in charge of Mr. Rahmatullah Khan, the Head Clerk. Mr. G. A. MunGavin arrived on the forenoon of the 6th idem, from Bahrain, and assumed charge the same day and was still in office at the close of the year. Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan, Sadid-es-Sultaneh, continued nominally as Foreign representatives. Russian Consular Agent throughout the year, but owing to the fact that his Go?ernment was virtually non-existent, occupied his time in voluntarily assisting the Vice-Consulate and the Military. Information given by him from time to time proved to be interesting, if not particularly important, but he endeavoured to make himself useful in many ways, and his services were very greatly appreciated. Sartip Mirza Ali Karam Khan, Shuja-i-Nizam, C.I.E., held the post of T . n , Deputy Governor throughout the year. local Government, He continued to work n well ffi th the Political and Military Authorities throughout, and was always ready to do everything in his power to assist in the promotion of British interests. Although quite illiterate, he is a shrewd far-seeing individual, and can be relied on to stand by us at all times, and be entirely guided by us in all matters. In recognition of his loyal and valuable services during the war, he was awarded the C.I.E. during the year under review. The Deputy Governor. Bandar Abbas, performed the duties of Karguzar- Karguzar. or ■ Pore ig n Agent, almost till the close of the year; Agha Mirza Abbas Khan, the Mushir-Uloom, assuming charge of these duties on the 18th of December 1918. Up to the close of the year, the new Karguzar, who appears to be a quiet individual, had not given any trouble. Haji Khan, Mashaq, held the post of Deputy Governor throughout the ■p. , „ , year. He was a well-meaning, but verv Deputy Governor, Minab, weak individual. Monsieur Guillaume held charge of the Persian Customs Department throughout the year, except for the period U8toms ' 26th May to 2nd October, when temporary charge was held by Monsieur Graux ; Monsieur Guillaume being granted short leave in India. The relations between the Consulate and the Customs Department were on the whole most cordial throughout the year. {a) A Military Court of Enquiry, presided over by Lieutenant-Colonel n j,.. ,,, , E. J. D. Colvin, was held in Eebruary, at tt 011 110n 0 0 countr ^ which it was conclusively proved that toe Kalantars of Rezwan and Ein had assisted the robbers who attacked and looted the South Persia Rifles caravan on 28th December 1917. On 14ith Eebruary 1918, Rais Rasulah, Kalantar of Ein w 7 as arrested and shot by order of the Inspector General, South Persia Rifles. This had a good effect as there were only two more raids during the remainder of the year. The first was on 25th July, when the South Persia Kmes post at Ab-i-Din was attacked by 68 Mazidi Arabs. The raiders were beaten off losing two killed, six wounded, and one prisoner. The second onIn ANNUAL REPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY 19ch August at Rudkhaneh-i-Shur, when some camels belonging to a Persian merchant were carried off ; but these were subsequently recovered by the local Deputy Governor. {b) Minab and District.—HhQYQ was, practically speaking, no trouble in the Minab District throughout 1918. The trade of the port showed an improvement over 1917, and this is chiefly attributable to the comparative safety of Tra(le ' the caravan routes over previous years due to the presence of British troops in the country, although the fact of the Bushire-Shiraz route being entirely closed, also accounted for the increase in trade to a great extent. Many of the Government transports visiting the port, by special arrange ment, carried ordinary merchandise besides Military stores. {a) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company on Kishm Island made very little progress during the year.

The lack of shipping facilities, together with an over abundance of water in the boring at various stages, are the two chief factors to which such slow progress is attributed. The latter difficulty is, however, now being dealt with as met, by the insertion of various strings of casing. Mr. J. L. Wright was still directing operations on the Island at the close of the year. (6) A branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia was opened at Bandar Abbas on the 12th of Uctober, under the management of Mr W. J. d'Alton. During the three months it was open in 1918 the business was far better than anticipated. Japanese goods continued to be imported during the year.

H. Mason, I.M.D., and proceeded on leave to India, returning on 2nd December, when he again assumed charge, remaining in office at the close of the year. (b) Total number of patients during the year amounted to 3,889 as compared with 3,388 the previous year. The above figures only include new cases. (&lt;?) Influenza, in epidemic form appeared about the third week in October, and died out towards the last week in November. The epidemic was very widespread and extremely severe.

The pier had not been completed at the end of the year under review, Naiband pier. though very substantial progress had been made. Unfortunately the site selected for it does not appear to have been the best, owing to scarcity of water even at high tides, due to the shelving nature of the beach. Twenty -seven slaves applied for manumission during the year. Out of this slave8 number 21 were manumitted. One was transferred to Vice-Consul, Lingah, for ceoessary action, being from his district. One was returned to his owner. Three absconded after applying for manumission and one case was still pending settlement. The South Persia Eifles (The 1st Ahmed Shahi Infantry) continued to South Persia Rifle,. ^ efu l work , ^otli in Bandar Abbas itselr and on the road during the year. The strength, towards the end of the year was diminishing rather rapidly, owing to the majority of men, whose time had expired, leaving the force; besides this, of course, the influenza epidemic made serious ravages on the various posts throughout the district.

The Handley Page machine, as it was approaching the town, sweeped down like a gigantic bird and flew quite low over the town finally alighting on the landing ground near the Consulate. The landing was witnessed by the Deputy Governor and all officials and merchants. This event caused quite a sensation throughout the District over which the Handley Page passed, and it is to be hoped that the near future will see machines permanently stationed here for punitive purposes, as there is no doubt that their presence alone would have an excellent effect on all trouble some tribes.

Khan Sahib Abdul Alim held the appointment of Extra Assistant to the Political Rendenfc throughout the year. Political History. —His Highness Prince Nnsrat-us-Sultaneh, who had been Governor-General since June 1916 Govemor-Gencral. vacated the post on 18th Pehruary and wais succeeded by Hishmat-ud-Douleh, who however did not arrive in Kerman till July 9tb. In the meantime the aged Nusrat-ul-Mamalik, head of the Zahir-ud-Douleh or ' Khanzada ' family, acted as Governor-General. The events which led up to the final rupture between Prince Nusrat-us- Sultaneh and Sardar Nusrat on 8th January are described in the Keport for 1917. At the beginning of the year the former shewed signs of weakening and readiness to follow the advice of His Majesty's Consul and leave the Sardar alone. This did not however suit the Democrats, with whose cause the Prince's right-hand man, Ihtisham-ud-Douleh, was now openly identified. Both regarded the Sardar, not without reason, as the protagonist of the Anglophil party and the chief stumbling-block in the way of their own political ascendency and personal profit. They therefore took care to foster the jealousy and injured vanity of the hasty, weak and inexperienced young Prince so as to prevent a rapprochement. Finally, an elaborate plot was concocted by Agha Yahya Rais- i-Mua'rif, Muin-ush-Shariya the Extremist leader and probably one or two other Democrats in consultation with IVtisham-ud-Douleh. The Sardar was to be threatened with an attack on his house at the Bagh-i-Nishat outside the city by the whole available force of Government sowars and forced to defend himself, when be could either be captured and bled, or at any rate proclaimed rebel. It was hoped that His Majesty's Consul and the South Persia Rifles would be persuaded that the Sardar had in fact some such intentions, and that they would be obliged to give the. Prince Governor a free hand. The coup was brought off on January 8th but did not turn out quite as its originators could have wished. Sardar Nusrat's men were tricked by 'agents provocateurs ' into firing the first shot, whereupon the Prince Governor pro claimed that he and three other leaders of the Moderate party were rebels and were attempting to overthrow the Government and the South Persia Rifles and loot the town. His Majesty's Consul and the Officer Commanding, South 1 ersia Rifles, however, w T ere not deceived, and by themselves occupying the 15agh-i-Nishat and disarming the Sardar's men, made themselves responsible for the behaviour of the so-called rebels and refused to allow them to fall into the hands of the Governor-General. The latter fulminated in vain : He telegraphed to the Shah, tried to organise basts through his Democrat friends, and issued a proclamation which gave so garbled a version of the whole alfair that His Majesty's Consul had to insist on his withdrawing it at once. Thoroughly disgusted with his coup manque and finding himself unable to get rid of the Sardar, the Prince employed his usual weapon of sending in is resignation in order thereby to bring pressure to bear on the Shah^ and abmet. His Majesty's Minister, however, as soon as he became acquainted with the true facts of the case, refused to allow the Sardar and his friends to I; ls ^edited and despoiled, and sent a message to the Prince Governor to the ettect that unless he rid himself of evil influences ' and left the pro-AllyFOR THE TEAR lyig. 19 party alone, British support would be withdrawn from him. But Ihtisham- ud-Douleh's evil influence was too strong, and rather than give him up after seveial weeks of prevarication and wire-pulling at the Capital, Prince Nusrat -us- Sultaneli left Kerman on 16tli February, taking with him at least a quarter of a million tomans m cash and carpets. Kerman breathtd once more. The efforts of His Majesty s Consul to obtain the appointment of Sardar Nusrat as acting Goyernor-General until the arrival cf the Governor-General- elect, Hishmat-udvDouleh, were unavailing owing to the hostility of the Democratic Cabinet of Mustaufi-ul-JVlamalik. Kusrat-ul-Mamalik's term of office was uneventlul, such little governing as was done being in tLe hands of his son JNusrat-us-Sultan and his nephew Mukhtar-ul-Mulk. Sardar Nusrat and bis family resented the preference shown to the rival Khanzada clan and were at first inclined to intrigue against them, but desisted at a hint from the Consulate. Ilishmat-ud-Douleh, a Tabatabai of good family in Azerbaijan, arrived on 9th Ju-y. He was formerly a friend of the Russians and is a decided Royalist in sympathies, having been Mohammad Ali Shah's Chief Secretary The fact that he was nominated by a Democrat Cabinet and was a friend of Mustashar- ud-Douleh, nowever raised great hopes among the Democrat party in Kerman who spread it abroad that he intended not to recognise the South Persia Rifles as a Persian Department, to forbid sale of grain to them and to hamper them ^ ev fT ^ W hatever may have been Hishmai-ud-Douleh's professions and beliefs m Tehran (and he himself admits having believed all kinds of Demo cratic slander of the British in South Persia) his ideas underwent a change very soon after his arrival and he became the open and professed—if not altogether sincere-admirer and partisan of the British. He is not stron^ either in character or physique, but possesses both adroitness and savoiv faive, while thanks to his Constantinople education he is not without knowledge of European affairs. The fact that he is neither a Prince nor a Bakhtiari with a large follow injj, one 01 the other of which all his predecessors for several years have been, detracts from his prestige; though extremely anxious to keep in with t e Consulate and South Persia Rifles, he is also afraid of the Democrats and attempts to make up for his lack of prestige by playing each off against the other Nevertheless he is an improvement on his predecessor, while his light hand man Muntasim-ud-Douleh, Deputy Governor, is a welcome change from the selfish and unscrupulous Ihtisham. Above all, the new Governor- General s relations ^ith Sardar Nusrat, Haji Mirza Ali Muhammad, etc., have so far beer, all that could be desired. During most of the last three months of the year he was inca| acitated by a serious ear complaint, for which he was successfully operated on by Dr. Dodson onlW 16th November, and afterwards bymfiuenza. \ Kamal-us-Sultan remained in office till April, when in spite of His Majes- Karguzari. ty's Minister's efforts on his behalf he p.. * was recalled by the Mustaufi-ul-Mama:ik Cabinet, chiefly because he was regarded as playing too much into the hands ot the British. Certainly, though weak and without influence, Kamal-us- ultan did his best to conduct the cases referred to him by His Majesty's Consu- ate without prejudice to British interests. /In particular he made himself unpopular with his own Government by agreeing with His Majesty's Consul on the vexed question of the jurisdiction of the Karguzc.ri in suits in whicti one of the parties is a British protected Persian subject. This principle, claimed y His Majesty's Governmpnt under its most favoured nation agreement with ■rersiaand endorsed by long practice, appears to have been consistently denied y recent Cabinets. In consequence, progress in certain test cases, notably endun vs. Bahadur-ul-Mulk, in re Shahjehanabad property, and Mirza uzurg vs. Mukhtar-ul-IIulk in re Khabis water righis, has been extremely l )0wer ^^ defendants being able, backed by the Ministers of Justice and foreign Affairs, to obstruct proceedings almost indefinitely so long as the arguzar himself is on their side Hence the appointment of Mujallal-us- M h H ^ ^ ace Kamal-us-Sultan. This man's last appointment was at esned whence he was removed for obstructiveness within three months at the request of the Russian Government. For several months after his arrival20 ANNUAL EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL EESIDENCT in July, in spite of repeated hints from the Consulate, he consistently avoided taking any action in the more impoitant cases and has only recently begun to show sispis of reasonableness. Miiza Hahihullah Khan, who has been connected with the Karguzari for many years and was Assistant Kar ^uzar under Kamal-us-Sultan, officiated during the interval between his departure and Mujallal-us-Sultaneh's arrival. The latter brought his son-in-law Mirza Mehdi Khan a clever but inexperienced and not over-trustworthy youth of about 20, as his Assistant and turned Mirza Habibullah Khan out; as this would have meant a complete break in continuity and endless trouble, His Majesty's Consul succeeded in obtainino: the reinstalment of the late Assistant as { Commercial Muavin ', Mirza Mehdi Khan remaining on the ' Political' side. Other Kerman Officials. —Mirza Habibullah Khan administered the Financial Department throughout thp Financial Departmen . yew. He is an independent and secre tive person with no social tastes, but energetic and capable. His efforts at collecting the arrears of revenue of the last two or three years were sufficiently successful to secure for him an unpopularity which he seemed thoroughly to enjoy. His policy throughout was to have as little as possible to do with politics in general or Eis Majesty's Consulate in particular. In September, following their usual plan of setting one official to spy upon another, tbe Tehran Government appointed Rafi-ul-Wizara, Inspector of Opium Excise, to act as Inspector of Finance, and probably owing to this Mirza Hahibullah Khan applied for a transfer shortly afterwards. At the end of the year orders were received for his replacement by Muhindis-ul-Mamalik, Shaikh-ul-Mulk as usual officiating until the latter's arrival. The Prince Governor's music-master, Mirza Mahmud Khan was 'Com- , mander-in-Chief of the Armies of Kerman 11 „ry epai mtn . and Baluchistan' until his master's departure, when Sardar Nusrat at once began to agitate for his old post. The influence of his enemies at Tehran, however, was too much for him in spite of the support of His Majesty's Legation, and after the Department had been administered by Iqbal-ul-Mulk for four months Prince Nasir-ud-Douleh, nephew of Prince Farman Farma, came from Tehran in July to take it up. The young Prince was reported to be merely a bird of passage and to have ulterior designs on the Governor-Generalship : however this may be, he took his duties seriously and continued drilling and organizing his men in earnest until his recall in November. Thanks, however, to the temporary Democratic eclipse at Tehran consequent on the final collapse of the Central Powers, the Sardar at last obtained the appointment he desired, nor is he likely to lose it again. The Department of Ediwation and Religious Bequests was held by the Democrat Agha Yahya throughout the year. That of Justice remained in the hands of Jallal-ul-Mamalik until April when the Mustaufi -ul-Mamalik Cabinet recalled him and appointed Yumn-us-Sultaneh, who arrived with the new Governor-General in July. Rukn-ul-Adila came at the same time as Hais-i- Beday.it (Court of First Instance). Yumn-us-Sultaneh, who is very proud of his legal studies in Paris, came full of schemes for reform, none of which matured. He was handicapped by the absence from tbe Provincial Budget of any provision for the Department of Justice, even for the pay of the Head, a iact which speaks for itself. He quarrelled with the Governor- General very soon after his arrival and was never quite reconciled to him, with the result that orders for his recall came at the end of the year. His successor is not yet known. The Opium Excise administration, which had previously been in th e hands of the Financial Agent, was taken from him in March when Rafi-ul* \ izara arrived as Inspector of Opium Excise. Later Asaf -ul -Mamalik, son-in- law of Mukhtar-ul-Mulk and a noted Democrat politician, came from Tehran to administer an ' Opium Department'. These appointments marked experi mental attempts on the part of the Central Government to exercise direct control of the provincial opium revenues. His Majesty's Consul has been unable to obtain definite information on the subject, but it appears thatFOR THE YEAR 1018. 21 towards the end of the year the Toumaniantz contract,* suspended the previous winter, was renewed and the system of direct control abandoned. At any rate, Asaf-ul -Mamalik was removed in December and it is probable, pace local opposition, that Mirza Assadullah Khan Kurdistani will come as agent on behalf of i'oumaniantz. The Road Guards' (Qarasuran) Department was held by Zahir-ul-Huzur, a nominee of Prince Nusrat-us-Sultaneh's, until the latter's departure. It then remained vacant until in September Hishmat-ud-Dou ! eh made an extremely satisfactory private arrangement with Sardar Nusrat's uncle, Salav Mufakhkbam, whereby the latter undertook the duties of the Department without remuneration, leaving most of the budget provision of tomans -7,000 per month to the Governor-General Such establishment of Road Guards as is kept up is paid for from rahdari collected—illegally of course—from caravans by the Qarasuran themselves, from which source also the Head of the Depart ment amply recoups himself. The Police Department is usually kept by the Governor-General for obvious reasons in the hands of one of his most faithful adherents, and it was accordingly held by an g^-head farrash of Piince Nusrat-us-Sultaneh's until thelatter's*^departure. During the interregnum Masud-ul-Mulk, nephew of the Acting Governor-General, was llais-i-Nazmieh, while Hishmat-ud-Douleh ^ave the post to one of his own Tabrizis, Ali Khan. The Police, though under manned (the nominal strength is 100) is the best run of the Local Government Departments and the force is on the whole surprisingly efficient. The Assistant to the Chief of Police, Eafat JSizam, is chietly responsible for this. The Municipality (Baladiya) suffered a severe blow in the early spring when the Finance Department, acting under orders from Tehran, cut down its Budget allotment by half. Needless to say there was no corresponding reduc tion in the Naicaqil (tax on pack-animals) or house tax, which are supposed to be earmarked for Municipal expenditure. The office of Eais-i-Baladiya accordingly lapsed and the w 7 ork has during most of the year been undertaken by the Police. District Governorships. These posts were held as follows :— Sirjari. —Mirza Mahmud Khan Tabatabai. Bam and Narmashir. —Sardar Mujallal, with Xasir-ul-Mamalik acting on his behalf from April onwards. Jqta' Afshar. —Asaf-ul-Mulk. ifo/m/tfw.—Mirza Saiyid Muhammad Khan until 20th March, Rukn-us- Sultan 21st March—28th October, Mustaan-ul-Mulk till the end of the year.

The Democrat party in Kerman is a small one, but amply makes up tor its numerical inferiority by its noisiness Democrats. an( l fi a i r for political intrigue. At ^the beginning of the year its hopes were centred on the success of the Prince Governor s campaign against Sardar Nusrat and the other Moderate leaders. Muin-ush-Shariya, whose brother Muayid-ul-Islam is one oi the chief Extremist wirepullers at Tehran, and Agha Yanya (recently appointed Superintendent of Education) were the ringleaders along with Jhtisnam- ud-Douleh in the plot against the Sardar, the lailure of which was re garded as a serious defeat for the Democrats. After two or three *£&gt;e0 Administration Uepoi 't for 1917, under heading' Revenue Department.22 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL EESIDENCT uesuccessful attempts to organize basts at the Telegraph Office in fay of the Prince, the extremists decided to send a &lt;e deputation ' to Tehran io co^ plain against the f&lt; atrocities and aggressions ' of the British and the insecuri?' of life and property caused by the Sardar's defiance of the Prince Governor^ authority. Financed partly by Ihtisham-ud-Douleh and partly by means f the heavy blackmail paid them by the Sardar himself, some thirteen of th more mischievous and irresponsible of the Kerman agitators, headed by Mir 6 Shahhab, brother of Agha Saiyid Jawad, went to Tehran in two or three parfe and Kerman enjoyed for several months a peace to which it had long been unaccustomed. The complaints of this 'delegation' to~the Anglophobe Cabinet of Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik, together with the discomfited Prince's use of his intluence with the Shah, caused a certain amount of anxiety during the sprin' but had no very serious results. The Sardar was once more summoned to Tehran and once more refused to go. In June, again, garblfd versions of the Allied reverses in France, of the Turkish advance in Azerbaijan and above all of the 'investment' of Shiraa bv the Qashgais caused considerable excitement in the town which the Democrats energetically fostered. The prospects of the Kerman South Persia Rifles following the example of their comrades in Fars were freely discussed. It was perhaps as well that the entire Brigade was kept in cholera quarantine camp throughout June, July and August, for it was thus effectively preserved from the influence of seditious propaganda. His Majesty's Consul with the assistance of the Officer Commanding, South Persia Eifles, and the Telegraph authorities, exercised an unofficial censorship over both the British and Persian telegraph offices, thereby preventing any wide spread knowledge of the seriousness of the situation elsewhere. The decidedly Anglophil attitude of Hishmat-ud-Douleh when he arrived at the beginning of July, and his action in taking security at His Majesty's Consul's request from six of the worst agitators, temporarily silenced the Democrats. The 'Delega tion ' also began to trickle back from Tehran, thoroughly disillusioned by the reception and treatment they hnd been accorded at Tehran; instead of being letecl and garlanded as they had expected, little attention and not much pecuniary assistance was given them : in fact, they only stayed as long as they did (until August) because they could not collect enough money to pay for their return journey. The catastrophic charges which took place in the Turkinh Empire and in Europe during the autumn were'of course serious blows to the Democrat cause, Elect;ons and little more would probably have been heard of the party at Kerman during the year, had it not been for the necessity of preparing for the elections. These were ordered by TV usuq-ud-Douleh soon after his accession to power in August, in the hope of strengthening his own position vis-a-vis the Shah and the extremists. In a remote and comparatively quiet province such as Kerman, nobody but the Democrats wants elections, which merely trouble the waters for agitators and w irepullers to fish in ; least of all does the Governor- General desire them, lor obviously the system of popular representation is quite income patible with that of autocratic provincial Governors, who have everything to lose and nothing to gain by the presence at Tehran ot irresponsible Deputies iom their provinces. The Muharram holidays, followed by the influenza epidemic, furnished valid enough excuses for delay, and during the last five months of the year all that was officially done was to appoint the Election Committee. The Democrats however were very busy holding frequent meet ing's and perpetually bombarding the Governor-General, whose weakness they nad early discovered. The selection of Asaf -ul -Mamalik, Mukhtar-ul-Mulk an g a Yahya to sit on the Election Committee, the only three other mem- )eis appointed being harmless non-partisans, was a great triumph for the democrats, as the result of the elections is held (no doubt correctly) to epen argely on the political sympathies of the Committee. His Majestys ^ u P r i Ta tely to the Governor-General against the nomination rw!i ai ^i lk aiKi ^ ha Yah y a &gt; on the grounds that they were Ap-Vm' v 0 ? Can 1 l a ^ e f ^ 0r e ^ ec tion : HLh mat -ud-Douleh consented to remoy e - o anya 3 but absolutely lefused to do the same to Asaf -ul-MamaliKi FOR THE YEAR 1918. 23 and before the end of the year he had nominated another Democrat election candidate, Agha Saiyid Jawad m Agha Tanya's place. A remarkable li&lt;»ht is thrown upon 1 ersia s ntness for Parliamentary institutions bv the fact that there is actually nothing in the law to prevent a candidate for'election being: 'i member of the Election Committee, nor does anyone from the Governor-Gene ral downwards see anything unusual in the spectacle as it were, of one of the parlies to a suit sitting upon the judge's bench. The Democrats had by the end of the year great hopes of electino- at least four of the six Musulman members for Kerman city and districts, namelv Asaf-ul-Aiama^ik, Agha Yahya, Muayid-uMslam and Agha Saiyid Jawad' while the Moderates, though they had collected a fair show of candidates on paper, w r ere not really hopeful about more than three, namely, Prince Nusrat- ud-Douleh (Minister of Justice in Wusuq-ud-Douleh's Cabinet), Rifat-iid- Douleh (brother of Sardar Nusrat) and Haji Mirza Murteza. Three of the above named candidates (Muayid-ul-Islam, Nusrat-ud-Douleh and Eifat-ud- Douleb) were at Tehran and likely to remain there, but the Persian Parliament ary laws allow of absentee candidature. * At the time of writing (February 10th) the position has improved consider ably. Asaf-ul-Mamalik has been won over by the Moderates and has made a compact promising the Prime Minister his support in case of election, Throuo-h him an alliance has been concluded between the family of Sardar Nusrat and that of Nusrat-ul-Mamalik, known as the ' Khanzada ' family, and the old rivalry between the ' Sheikhis ' and the ' Balasaris ' on which the Democrats were counting is temporarily in abeyance. The Democrats have ceased even to hope for the eleciion of more than three candidates, namely, Agha Saiyid Jawad, Muayid-ul-Is 1 am and Saiyid Mustafa. The Moderates have good hopes of securing the election of Haji Miiza Murteza and Asaf-ul-Mamalik for Kerman and neighbourhood, Shariat Madar for Eafsinjan and Zerind, Prince Nusrat-ud-Douleh for Sirjan, Eif'at-ud-Dauleh for Jiruft and Aqta, and Adl-us- Sultaneh (son of Sardar Nusrat) for Bam and Narmashir^. Condition of Country.—Owing to the drought which had lasted since the The food supply. spring of 1916, grain supplies were at a low ebb at the beginning of the year and prices, which six months previously had been standing at 12 tomans per Kharwar for wheat and 8 for barley, in January stood at 28 and 22 respectively. Even at these prices bread was only obtainable with the greatest difficulty, and by the spring the inhabitants of most of the villages were barely subsisting on millet- meal and berries. On two or three occasions the South Persia Eifles came to the rescue with such stocks as they could spare, some 400 Khar wars altogether being delivered to the local authorities at prices 6 or 8 tomans below the current rate. On the departure of the Prince Governor, who had been exploiting the situation in various ways—he made at least 6 tomans per Kharwar, for instance, —on the grain he allowed to be exported to Yezd from the Eafsinjan district, against his own strict orders—the supply improved a little and the town held out till July when a harvest distinctly above the average was reaped. Eor a week or two wheat and barley prices dropped from 35 and 22 to 20 and 16 respectively. But owing to the long continued scarcity the new harvest had been heavily mortgaged, particularly b} 7 the South Persia Eifles w r ho had been forced to safeguard their future position by large forward contracts. In these contracts the buying prices had perforce been left open, to be decided accord ing to the market rates current after the harvest had been brought in. Con sequently, not only the bigger landow^ners such as Nurullah Khan, Bahadur-ul- Mulk of Mashiz and others, but local groups of small owners and speculatort, combined to keep stocks off the market; the intention being, firstly, to force up post-harvest market rates so that the South Persia Eifles should pay as high a price as possible for grain purchased in advance, and, secondly, to starve both town and South Persia Eifles into paying still higher rates later on in the season. r ihe result was that from the beginning of July till the end of October the price of wheat rose steadily at the rate of a toman per week to tomans 38 per Kharw r ar, with barley at 28. Bread was dearer, worse in quality and no less difficult to obtain in the autumn of 1918, after a good harvest, than it was in the spring after two years of drought ; nor were the new Governor-General's2i ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GTTLE POLITICAL RESIDENCY half measures of the slightest avail to remedy this scandalous state of affairs. Beino- too weak— or perhaps too much interested—to take a strong line with the ffrain-OAvners, he coulcl do nothing to break prices without a large reserve the stock with which to feed the town in. the meantime. Such a reserve existed in the shape of the Government grain collected throughout the province by the .Financial Agent in part payment of revenue, amounting to about 2,500 Kharwars of wheat and a similar quantity of barley. If the Ministrv of Finance had released the grain at any time in the autumn scarcity and high prices would have been at an end : but the combined efforts of the Govunoi -General ai d His Majesty's Consulate were unable to induce the Ministry to pi ace it at the disposal either of the former or of the South Persia Rifles. While the Finance Minister bargained and intrigued, trying (unsuccessfully) to play off the Governor-General and South Persia Rifles against each other, the Government grain rotted where it lay and Kerman went hungry; until in November the South Persia Rifles contractor (Mr. A. E. Wetli) had collected a sufficient reserve by independent buying and went out of the market. This, together with good winter rains and the news of the Armistice, alarmed the owners and speculators ; gram became plentiful in the market and prices at once fell. At the moment of writing (February 11th) wheat is selling at tomans 25, a drop of tomans 13 since November. The year ended with pros pects distinctly brighter, except for the Finance Minister who found himself unable to get rid of his grain on a falling market. The abnormally high rates for hired transport {vide below) caused a corres ponding rise in the prices not only of imported commodities such as sugar, oil, rice and piece goods, but of fodder, firewood, ghi and other local produce and greatly added to the general distress. Epidemics. —To the undermining of the popular health by the long- continued scarcity of practically all the necessaries of life must be ascribed the appallingly high mortality which marked the epidemics of cholera and influenza which ravaged the province Cll0lera ' in June-July and Nov ember-December res pectively. Cholera broke out most unexpectedly at Rafsinjan on 8th May. The South Persia Rifles medical authorities in co-operation with the Local Government did their best to keep up a quarantine, but the outbreak had occurred too close to the city and on 2nd June a case occurred in the lines of the 6th South Persia Rifles Infantry which had that very day arrived on transfer from Saidabad. During the next 8 weeks the police reported l,7t3 deaths in the town, but these figures only represented the number of funerals counted by them at the town cemetery, and the total number including Parsis and Jews almost certainly exceeded 2,£00. The South Persia Rifles were moved out into a quarantine camp 8 miles from the city immediately on the outbreak ; thanks to the efficient arrangements made by Captain Roy, i .M.S., Acting Senior Medical Officer in the absence of Major J. B. Hance, i .M.S., both incidence and mortality were remarkably low in the Brigade, 108 cases occurring with 86 deaths. Inoculation was practised as far as the quantity of serum available permitted, and was highly successful. Among the Euro pean community the only deaths at Kerman were those of Mr. J. C. Smith, Superintendent, Indo-European Telegraph Department (23rd June), and Corporal Smith (Mechanical Transport) on September 8th. Captain Koy and Corporal Byles of the South Persia Rifles Instructional staff were also seized, but recovered. There were no cases among the Consulate staff. Very ew of the Kerman officials or notables died, most of them having at the outset tied to summer resorts m the hillt*. In the districts the epidemic was at least as severe as in the city, parti* cmarly m Zerind, Sirjan, Bam and Narmasbir. The disease which appeared rst m the west of the province advanced steadily across it reaching 13am at the ena of June and the borders of Sistan at the beginning of August. Influenza appeared at Saidabad at the end of October and at Kerman on inflnetiza. ^th November. In both towns the _ 0 j . t • *■ incidence must have been above 90 per cent. certainly among Persians in Kerman His Majesty's Consul did not hearFOR THE YEAR i9i8. 25 of more than two or three who escaped seizure. For about three weeks the number of deaths in the town, mostly from septic pneumonia and bronchitis, must have been from 100—200 per day and as practically everyone in the town was ill at the same time, all business was temporarily suspended The entire Consulate staff with the exception of the Accountant, two Non -Commissioned Officers and one sowar of the Escort were taken ill; one sowar died. There w^ere no deaths among the European residents, but Captain 1). N. Carr, South Persia Eifles, died at Saidabad on his way from Kerman to' India on short leave, and four officers (Major Eowle and Captains Martin, LM.S., Sherwood and Jelly) had to be invalided to India, Of the 19 European civilians including children, four escaped seizure. For the Kerman Brigade South Persia Eifles the figures were as follows:— Kerman , Saidabad Narmashir Case inciderce. Deaths. Mortality. 1,500 (approximate) 91 6 per- cent. 9C0 „ 77 8-5 150 „ 49 32-6 Total 2,550 ^approximate) 217 8-5 per cent. The total number of deaths in the towm reported by the Police was 1,^60 but these figures are almost certainly incomplete. Nusrat-ul-Mamalik, the aged head of the Khnnzada family, who had acted as Governor-General from 17th February to 19th July {vide above), died on 15th December. In the districts, particularly Jiruft, Bam and Narmashir, Eafsinjan and Khahis, the epidemic was far severer even than in Herman, and all reports agreed that throughout the province it was the worst that had occurred w r ithin the memory of man. The country people and tribesmen had no warning of the danger and were quite unprepared. The influenza was regarded merely as a severe cold, no precautions were taken and agricultural and other out-door work was proceeded with. The result was that from ^ twenty-five to fifty per cent, or even more of the population of most districts was wiped out. Fields were left half tilled, transport animals and other property abandoned ownerless, in fact the life of the province was brought to a standstill. It will take years for the province to recover from this calamity. Apart from the cholera and influenza, there was an abnormal prevalence of enteric and allied fevers throughout the province in ihe spring and early summer, amounting to an epidemic at Baghin and neighbouring villages, and also in Bam district. Excepting for the disturbances of January 8-h described above, the tow^n was quiet throughout the year. The Districts, 4/sAar.—Gunj Ali Khan, Ilkhani of the Afshar, died on 18th August. The succession to the Ilkhaniship The Tribes. was disputed for a long time between Hojabr-us-Sultaneh, younger brother of the deceased Ilkhani, and Salar Ashayir, nephew of Gunj Ali Khan and son of his predecessor Mirza Khan.^ As Hojabr-us-Sultaneh and his son Nasir Nizam had from the outset been actively useful to the South Persia Eifles in connection with the Baft Levies, recruiting lor the Brigade, etc., while Salar Ashayir's brother Muhammad Eafi Khan w r as strongly pro-German in the disturbances of 1915-16 and raised a force on their behalf. His Majesty's Consul and the Officer Commanding, South Persia Eifles, favoured the former's appointment, w hich was announced on 8th October. Salar Ashayir and his section of the tribe refuse to acknowledge Hojabr's title, and the former partition of the tribe continues, each section^ keeping to itself and occupying separate summer and winter grazings. Ilojabr and his section liave their headquarters at Hushun, 20 miles west of Baft in the hot weather26 ANNUAL REPORT OF 1HE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY and at Hasan Paki, 12 miles East of Chah Chaguk on the Saidabad-Tarun roa^ in the cold ; Salar Ashayir's section graze round Dasht Ab and Deh Sard in the summer and in the 3)aulatabad-XJrzu in the winter. There have however been no disturbances within the tribe during the year. The Buchaqchi tribe was quiet throughout under the chiefship of Murad Khan Shikuh-us-Sultam brother of the rebel Hussain Khan Mho is still at Tehran. The latter began applying to His Majesty's Legation both directly and through Sardar Jang, immediately after the^ Armistice was declared, to be allowed to return to Kerman province. As he is known to be in close toucli with the Demrcrats here and would undoubtedly be used by them as a rally- ing point if he returned, His Majesty's Consul deprecated the proposal. Jiruft —For the first two months of the year J iruft was misgoverned by Prince Nusrat-us-Sultaneh's nominee Muhammad Taki Khan Bakhtiari, whose reckless exactions reducrd the district to a state of anarcny. At the end of February Yar Muhammad Khan and Jallal Khan, sons of Nawab Khan Bameri, raided the length and breadth of the district with a large lashkar of 400 Bameris and Sabikis. Muhtashim-ul-Mulk, bardar Nusrat's nephew and agent in the district, called in the help of Zargham-us-Sultaneh, Deputy (Governor of Eudbar, who attacked the Bameri chiefs at the end of the Jaz Murian Hamun and recovered half the booty they had taken. Meanwhile Muhammad Taki hsd ignominiously fled in the direction of Kerman; after the departure of the Prince Governor he was deposed and Adl-us-Sultaneh, Sardar Nusrat's son, made Governor. jludbar —Mir Barkat of Biabanand Muhammad Khan appeared in Basha- kard with a lashkar early in February their avowed object being to prosecute a blood feud against the heirs of Islam Khan. Their real inteotion was merely to loot lludbar. With the help of Muhtashim-ul-Mulk the Zargham drove the invaders back. There appears to be a kind of reciprocity between Muhtashim-ul-Mulk and the Eudbar Governor. Jamal Barez. —Jamal Barez suffered from the depredations of Sanjar and Pushtgudari raiders in the spring, and also from the activities of the energetic and unpopular Eevenue Agent Muayid-ul-Mamalik. Ba^ts at Bam against this official had little effect, but in September the Kavkanis revolted and called in their iSamdadi neighbours, thereby succeeding in restricting the Eevenue Agent's operations for a w r hile. Persian Baluchistan. —The reports regarding Perso-Baluch affairs T\hicli reach Kerman under present conditions are both irregular and inaccurate. It had been evident however that in the year under report the position of Bahrain Khan of Bampur has been stronger than in 1917. Since the death of Islam Khan in autumn 1917 he has continued in undisturbed possession of the Bampur Khalisajat (Crown lands), also those of Daman and Abtar. Bint, Geh and the other lands of Islam Khan continued in the possession of his family and that of Sardar Said Khan. Bahram Khan's chief rival in the West is Nawab Khan, the Bameri Sardar, who leads a loose confederation of Bameris, Sabikis, Naruis, etc. The blood-feud, which began in December 1916 with the killing of two of Bahram Khan's kinsmen by Jallal Khan, son oi Nawab Khan, is intensified by religious feeling, Bahram Khan being a Sunm and Nawab Khan a Shia. Bam and Narmmhir. —In January Narmashir which had been quj^ during the latter months of 1917 began once more to suffer from the depreda tions not only of the Baluch but also of local brigands. Up to that time, ever since the Persian Government virtually abandoned Baluchistan in 1907-0»j the Narmashir-Baluchistan marches had been policed by a nominal force o 100 Levy (Jambaz) sowars kept up by the Bam Governor ; the pay of this force used to be divided among certain petty Baluch chiefs of the border. The Persian Government now suddenly abolished this arrangement, nor were the protests o the Deputy Governor of Bam, Sardar Mujallal, of any avail though supp 0 ? ® by the Governor-General and His Majesty's Consul. Finally, at the ^ vltat ^ of Sardar Mujallal, Brigadier-General Sir P. Sykes visited Bam on ^ iebruary 1918 with Colonel Farran and His Majesty 's Consul and anan-)FOK THE TEAE 1918. 27 with the Sardar for the institution in Narmashir of an irregular force of Levy Camelry 100 strong, as a part of the South Persia Kifles establishment. No British officer being available, Kissaidar Ahmad Yar (SGLh Jacob's Horse), one of the Instructors of the Kerman Brigade, was detailed with the local rank of Sultan to traiu the Camelry who were to be collected by Sardar Mujallal. Ihe force was not intended to be anythiug more than a substitute for the abolished Jambaz sowars, nor to be used for anything but police work and defence in Bam, Narmashir, Jamal Barez and possibly Jiruft; but it caused the greatest consternation among the Bameri and allied border clans, who foresaw a curtailment of the periodic raids into the fat Narmashir and Jiruft lands by which they 'had profited for so long, As a result Sardar Mujallal, who bad hoped to secure good fighting material by recruiting among the same border Baluch who had formerly been in receipt of Jambaz pay, found it / impossible for himself and Ahmad Yar to keep\) force together ; 70 of the 100 originally recruited deserted in April, 40 of whom under their officer, / Mir Muhammad Taqi, at once reverted to their former predatory habiis. In May Ahmad Yar, who had made his headquarters at Burj-i-Muhammad (8 miles South-East of Fahreh in Narmashir), was in an awkward position with only 25-30 men and no support nearer than Kerman, 170 miles distant. Luckily a small composite detachment under Captain Kreyer, Officer Command ing Dehaneh Baghi, happened to arrive in the distiict at the end of May escort ing a caravan carrying specie for the Imperial Bank of Persia from Birjand to Kerman; acting under orders from Kerman, Captain Kreyer after handing the specie over to the Bam authorities marched against Mir Muhammad Taqi, whom he found with 40 men at Kasimabad, 20 miles South-East of Fahreh. In the ensuing engagement Muhammad Taqi and three others were killed, the rest escaping. After this the prospects of the Camelry brightened, and their numbers reached HO or more. Unfortunately, however, on 8th October Bis- saidar Ahmad Yar was shot in the bazaar at Bam in broad daylight by Yar Muhammad Khan, son of the Bameri Sardar. The murder of one w r ho had borne himself well and had been respected throughout Bam and Narmashir caused much local indignation. The Baluch, who were in Pam district in some numbers, left it hurriedly fearing reprisals, and concentrated under Yar Muhammad in Narmashir. The situation was eased, however, by the arrival at Bam on 16th October under the command of Captain Coffey of a detachment of South Persia Rifles Infantry which had already been under orders for Narmashir under ' Iload Construction ' below). Captain Coffey found Narmashir quiet and the Baluch fled. Arrangements had at once been made through the local authorities for get ting into touch with the Bameri Sardar and if possible inducing him and Yar Muhammad to come into Bam or Kerman with a view to settling the repara tion to be paid by the Bameri for the murder. Both Nawab Khan and his son expressed their readiness to come in under guarantees; but in the in fluenza epidemic w r hich shortly afterwards ravaged Narmashir and Persian Baluchistan Yar Muhammad died and his father was taken seriously ill, so that by the end of the year no further progress had been made in the case. After the death of Ahmad Yar the Camelry deteriorated, and their numbers were further greatly reduced by influenza. Early in January the Officer Commanding Kerman Brigade proposed that the Camelry should be disbanded and this was sanctioned. As, however. Bam and Narmashir had been free from Baluch lawlessness and incursions since the arrival of the South Persia Rifles detachment and as the local Persian authorities made strong representa tions for its retention on this account, it has been decided to keep it in the district for the present. Condition of roads. —Thanks to the organization by the South Persia Bifles of the Bandar Abbas-Tarum- Bandar Abbas-Keman routes. Saidabad road as a military Line of Com munications, with posts, a telephone and regular escorts, the two easterly routes, via Daulatabad and Jiruft respectively, were practically unmolested by the Baharlu throughout the year. The Baluch on their side do not seem to prey on caravan traffic to any great extent. On the Saidabad road ilseli28 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL EESIDENCT there was a certain amount of raiding in the spring, one particularly darincr raid being effected by Chahhaqis and Paiqalehis early in March between Masbiz and Khunsarkh on the Kerman-Saidabad section. South Persia Rifle S cavaby from Kerman under Major Fowle, J.A., performed a remarkable march in pursuit, reaching Chah Ilaq itself and covering miles in 101 days, but without success. The capture^ and execution at Saidabad in April of the notorious Muhammad Ismail Beg Nazarbeglu (Baharlu) had a good moral effect. Above nil, the march of the Shiraz Reinforcement echelons from the coast to Shiraz by the Tarum-Saidabad and Tarum-Qatru routes in April and May, and th3 successful operations carried out by them and by the Isiriz garrison against Kuhistan tribes in May, kept the latter quiet till the autumn when two or three raids were carried out on the Tarum -Saidabad Section. The most successful of these was one by a band o f 60 Nazarbegins who attacked a South Persia Eifles convoy of 70 unloaded camels at Puzeh Khun at night, panicked the escort of 50 South Peisia Rifles and carried off all the animals except seven. At the end of July the 70 horse and 30 foot levies at Baft, who had been maintained since 191^ by the South raulatabad-Baft road • t»'u i xi • i* i J ersia James under their direct control, were disbanded, the organization of the Saidabad route having rendered their upkeep an unnecessary expense. Gunj Ali Khan Ilkhani of the Afshar, and in succession to him llojabr-us-Sultaneh were from thenceforward subsidised for the upkeep of 10 horse and ?0 foot road-guards on the Balt-Daulatabad and Baft-Saidabad roads. This arrangement appears to have worked satisfactorily up to the present. The comparative safety of the Bandar Abbas-Kerman routes was un fortunately of little use to the Kerman public, owing to the fact that the Base authorities were obliged to impress for military purposes nearly all the trans port animals arriving at Bandar Abbas from the middle of March practically to the end of the year. Transport owners have never liked military employ ment on the Tarum-Saidabad road, partly because the escorts interfere with their independence and make them travel much faster than they are accustomed to, partly because the route is a bad one for grazing and supplies. They accordingly soon learnt to avoid Bandar Abbas, and by the autumn it was almost impossible for merchants to get their goods up from Bandar Abbas at all, even at the excessive rate of tomans 100 per 100 Tabrizi mans (roughly Es. 250 per camel-load). By the beginning of October some 40,000 camel loads of goods involving a capital of nearly Es, 1-| crores, were lying at Bandar Abbas ; prices soared in Kerman, Yezd and other up-country centres, and more than one importing firm was threatened with bankruptcy. Purther the demand for rupee drafts in India ceased, with the result that the Bank was unable to collect krans for the supplying of the South Persia Rifles' heavy requirements. This serious commercial and financial deadlock, which was the subject of correspondence between His Majesty's Consul, His Majesty's Legation and the General Staff, Shiraz, has been gradually relieved during the^ last few weeks (February 11th) by the partial release of transport by the military authorities at Bandar Abbas, and by the diversion of trade to the Bushire-Shiraz and Basrah-Baghdad-Kermanshah routes. It is difficult to see how a breakdown oould have been avoided, for with the total available transport in the country greatly reduced by the drought of 1916-17, the Bandar Abbas-Saidabad road could not be expected to bear the strain of acting at one and the same time as the sole Line of Communications for the forces in Pars and Kerman provinces, and also as the only channel of trade for the whole of Southern Persia. In January the Chabarrahis, Lashanis, Tutakis, Sarchahanis and other Yezd road. bands resumed their activities on the Yezd , road, which had been unmolested since Sep- tember 1917, when a South Persia Eifles column marched through their country re detachment of South Persian Eifles Cavalry stationed at Anar was unable Jto cope with tho bands, which often numbered as many as 200, though the British JN on-Commissioned Officer in command displayed ^reat activity and recovered much of the loot on more than one occasion. The following monthFOR THE YEAR 1918. 29 it was decided to arrange for regular bi-weekly escorts to be supplied by the Anar detachment for all caravans between Anar and Mehdiabad where there was a force of Bakhtiari guards. The system worked well, and no more robberies were reported up to the time that the detachment was withdrawn owing to the cholera epidemic in June. After the cholera, in deference to the repre sentations of the Persian Government, the South Persia Eifles detachment was not sent back to Anar. Obviously the presence of the detachment and its monopoly of the escorting of caravans interfered with the profits of the Koad -Guards who during the remainder of the year levied rohdari at the rate of krans 6 50 per camel, krans 4 per mule and krans 2-60 per donkey on this road. These exactions made possible the arrangement described above under ' Road Guards.' The robber tribes recommenced raiding in late September and early October, but the influenza put a stop to their activities and the road w r as quiet till the end of January 1919. At the date of writing (11th February 1919) the Kermanshahan Pass has been blocked for some days by ChaLarrahis, who have looted several caravans, and the question of sending a detachment to Anar has once more been raised. The unmetalled road via Saidabad to Hajiabad (200 miles) has been in Road Construction. regular use by military motor-oars. In June and July, Major Lowis, U.Jj], greatly improved 18 miles of it between Bid Khah and Saidabad on the Kerman- Saidabad stction. The South Persia Rifles Pield Engineers under Captain Wharton com menced work on an unmetalled road from Kerman to Bam (1^0 miles) at the beginning of April, and finished it in four months. Motors can now reach Bam within a day without difficulty, six days being usually taken by caravans. At the end of Pebruary, His Majesty's Consul accompanied Colonel Farran, Officer Commanding, Kerman Brigade, by motor to Dehaneh Baghi on the Sistan border (300 miles) via Bam and the Pahreh-Sipi desert route. Although the only point at which any roadmaking had then been done was at the top of the pass between Gurg and Sipi, no great difficulty w T as experienced, and the double journey only occupied 12 days including a day's halt each way at Bam. The chief obstacle is the sandy belt at Shurgaz in the middle of the desert, where cars are liable to stick seriously unless helped through by labourers brought from Pahreh. A detachment of 180 infantry under Captain Coffey was sent to Nar- mashir early in October, and took up its quarters at Burj-i-Muhammad 8 miles south of Pahreh with a view to the policing of Narmashir and to the construction and protection of the Narmashir section of the Khwash-Bam road. This road was constructed by the detachment in continuation of the Kerman-Bam road to Rigan (60 miles) before the end of the year. Captain Ward, Commandant Sarhad Levies, had meanwhile carried the Khwash section via Samsur (Bazman district) to within two or three marches of Rigan. Until the end of February the Bandar Abbas post was irregular owing n , , c . to the heavy snow on the Kafanu and Ihe rostal bervice. „ i i i rr j Zarchu passes between Kerman and Baft. After that the service was both reasonably rapid (9-1^ days) and regular until .November, when the deaths from influenza of the Sub-Postmaster at Daulatabad and of most of the ghulaws on the road caused great confusion and delay. At the end of December the passes once more became blocked with snow, and for the last six weeks letters have been taking Irom twenty days to a month each way. Except during the cholera epidemic, when the service broke down a* Anar and the mails were held up for a month, letters took on an a\ erage 40 days to come from Tehran. Parcels however took very much longer owing to delay caused by the presence of robbers on the road. Recruiting for the Brigade went on briskly during the early part rni a of the year, and in April and May the e South Persia Ri es. strength of the force was probably at its greatest. In Septembe**, however, orders were received to stop recraiting, with the result that owing to the heavy mortality (about 10FOR THE TEAR ,918. 31 subjects outf -ide were tried by Commissions appointed by the Governor-General Altliou^h in such cases His Majesty's Consul was usually consulted both His Majesty's Consul and Officer Commanding were always careful to insist on the right ot the South Persia Rifles as a Persian Department to deal direct with Persian authorities without the official intervention of either Consulate or Karguzari. This principle, which Prince Nusrat-us-Sultaneh always evaded was conceded explicitly by Hishmat-ud-Douleh shortly after his arrival unon representations from His Majesty's Consul. 1 During the Ears crisis of^ May-July, the Kerman Brigade remained unaffected by unrest or sedition. A very few desertions did take place but they were due to the men's anxiety about their families durin&lt;* the cholera Apart from the credit justly due to the British officers of the South Persia Rifles, this satisfactory state of affairs was due in the opinion of His Maiestv's Consul' (1) to the very small proportion of former members of the Swedish Gendarmerie existing in the Brigade; (2) to the absence within the province of any powerful unfriendlv tribes; (3) to the fact that throughout June and July the entire Brigade was — isolated in camp three miles from the city owing to the cholera epidemic.

JayJor continued to manage the Kerman branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia without jthe assistance of a British accountant. The Church Missionary Society was represented on the medical side by hr, G. E Dodson and Dr. Gertrude Westlake throughout the year. Considerable progress was made with the building and fitting of the new Mission Hospital. The Eevd. A. K. Boy land arrived from England: on 11th July : owing to the complete absence of qualified teachers and to other causes, he has been unable to reorganize the Mission School. The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Limited was represented until August by Mr. A E. Wetli who was replaced by Mr. J. Joannides from Tabriz. Mr. Wetli, who was joined early in January 1919 by his brother Mr. E. Wetli, is contractor for al) local supplies to the South Persia Eifles. The total number of cases settled by the Karguzari under Consulate supervision, including cases in which the interests of foreign subject or firms and of British-protected Persian subjects were concerned was 10. Twenty- four cases were pending at the end of the year. No action under the Criminal Procedure Code was taken by His Majesty's Consul throughout the year.

Tlle clnef even ts of the year under re' view are enumerated below In January it was reported that 40 of Eustam Khan's followers had made a surprise attack upon Waznam, North-East of .Oharbar and killed one of Mahmud Khan's subjects. There was some looting before the invaders pro ceeded inland. On their way Durra Khan, son of Mahmud Khan, attacked them, killing two and severely wounding two of the party. Mir Barkat sent several hundred men with Ayub Khan and went himself to Marz to collect more with a view to rejoining Ayub Khan later for the punishment of the late Islam Khan's murderers who had taken refuge with Sahib Khan. He came to Bint with a large following but fortunately an amicable settlement was arrived at between the sons and brothers of Islam Khan. Mir Barkat returned to Biyaban. In the same month news was received to the effect that Mir Bahram Khan of Bampur who was at Eask with 800 followers, intended to attack the Telegraph party constructing a line between Suntsar and Charbar. It transpired, how ever, that Bahram _ Khan had come to punish Sardar Mahmud Khan of Dashtyari who had killed one Jan Muhammad. A peace was patched between them at Champ where all the leading chiefs of the country had assembled. In March, Ali Jami of Bahu came to Gwadur with twenty armed men to release by force two Baluchis (subjects of the Sultan of Muscat) imprisoned by the Wali of Gwadur for disobedience. As the men had been in imprisonment for a long time and were in a weak state of health and the Wali was anxious to avoid a fight, they were liberated and Ali Jami returned to Bahu. In May, seven men, eight women and fifteen children who said they came from Hamadan via Kermanshah and Minab arrived at Charbar and asked to be allowed to proceed to Muscat. They said they had left their country on account of the oppression of the Russians who were in occupation. They were sent to His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Bandar Abbas. At the close of July Mudat Khan, the former guardian of Hussain Khan and Mir Hoti of Lashar, with 500 men attacked Hussain Khan's fort at Gaih hut were driven on. Ayub Khan proceeded to Gaih with 200 armed men. Two of Hussain Khan's men were killed and two slightly wounded before the two parties came to an understanding. Khalifah Khair Muhammad wfee, w T hen last heard of, was at Eanooch. Ho twice announced his intention of attacking Charbar with a large following but nothing came of it. The news of the surrender of Germany has undoubtedly had a good effect on the people of Persian Baluchistan. The Turks mentioned in the enclosed report were said to have left Biyaban for Bampur to visit Bahram Khan. They gave out that they would shortly return with arms and ammunition. Old claims against the chiefs subsidised by the Telegraph Department and the people of Persian Baluchistan to alms, the- extent of Es. 1,634 were settled during the war.84 ANNUAL EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESILEKCT No foreign subjects resided at the Foreign sub]ects. 0 £ the ]y[ e ] sran Q 0ast The following chiefs were in receipt of telegraph subsidies during the vear Name of chief.

A new telegraph line between Suntsar and Charbar w r as constructed during the year. This line is further inland than the old line, in country less subject to floods and not so affected by the damp sea breeze. The line is at present partly temporary but^ will be made permanent when the state of the country permits of the work being completed.

The 1st March 1919.\ por the tear 1918. 37 Report No. 56, dated 38th December 1918 Superintendent, Jas/c Sub-Division, to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, Karachi. I have the honour to submit a brief report on tbe condition of the country between Biyaban and Eabu tor tbo year 1918. ^ B itaban D istrict. Mir Barkat has been Kalantar of this district throughout tbe year A considerable amount of ill-feeling exists between the Tahirzais ?nd the' Mirs of Biyaban owing to blood feuds. Mir Barkat had written in May savino- that the former were quite willing to have matter referred to Shara but thai ft was necessary that some high official should be present to enforce the decision. On the 2nd of August 1918 news was received that tbe Tahirzais had surrounded the house of Saiyid Abdur Eahim of Eiyaban with intention to kill him and in his absence shot his brother-in-law. On 13th October 1918 Colonel Gregson arrived at Jask but Mir Barkat, who had been asked to come there and lay his grievances before him, did not have an interview, as he would not come 'into the limits, baring taken an oath that he would never enter the limits as some years previously he had been taken prisoner there and handed to tbe Persian authorities. As far as can be ascertained nothing has yet been settled. On the 18th August 1918, report was received that three Turks had left Sih for Biyaban via Bampur and Eudbar ; they were lost sight of after leaving the latter place. On the 2nd December 1918, it was reported that they had visited Barkat but where they went to subsequently not know r n. Nothing else of importance has occurred in this district during this year. J ask D istrict. The district continues to be administered by Mir Mustafa Khan and the condition has generally throughout the year been satisfactory. On the 19th of September a fracas took place between the Sunnis and Shias, but a settle ment was brought about, the principal offender on either side being punished, the former with imprisonment and the latter with a fine. Mir Hoti of Jask has very little influence in the district, gives us no trouble and does his best to look to our interests in the place. G aih D istrict. The Sardar of this district is Hussain Khan. He is still very young and headstrong. At first his uncle Mudat Khan was guardian but in June, owing to Mudat Khan squandering most of the revenue, Hussain Khan asked Mahmud Khan of Panooch to be his guardian and look to his interests. This, of course, caused a deal of ill-feeling, and Mudat Khan claimed half the Gaih district, producing a bond containing Hussain Khan's seal to this effect. It is said that the bond was forcibly obtained at the time Hussain Khan lef«'/ the fort to attend the funeral ceremony of Islam Khan and on his return found the fort occupied by Azam Khan, son of Mudat Khan, and admittance w r as refused. After the bond had been sealed, Mudat Khan and his son evacuated the fort and built another a short distance away. When Mahmud Khan took over the guardianship, Mudat Khan arranged with Mir Hoti of Lashar to drive Hussain Kban out. The attempt proved unsuccessful, the casualties being very small. Mir Din Muhammad of Dashtiari, who is fast Ijecoming the most powerful chief in these parts, gave Mudat Khan his moral support, and is doing his best to get a share in the governing of Gaih district, and tried to arrange a marriage between his daughter and Hussain Khan so as to have an excuse to enter Gaih but up to date the matter has not been settled. B int D istrict. This district was under the joint administration of Sahib Kban (brother of Islam Khan) and Yahya Khan until a few days ago when Sahib Khan3S annual report of the persian gulf political residency succumbed to influenza. The Karwanis and Joushdaris are completely out of hand and do not acknowledge any of the chiefs, they have been systematically damaging our lines removing insulators and theatering our line staff. Both Sahib Khan and Yahya Khan have on several occasions promised to punish the culprits and prevent recurrences but did not do anything. It now remains to be seen whether Yahya Khan wall take any steps. The Khalifah is still inimical to the British and attempted to raise a follow ing to destroy our lines and attack Charbar, but as the chiels did not give him support the idea was abandoned. Another man with fanatical intentions is Saiyid AHm Shah, who supported the Khalifat and is reported to have persuaded Mir Hoti of Lashar to join in the movement but apparently they did not succeed in getting together a suffi cient following as nothing was done by them. Dashtiari District. Mahmud Khan and Din Muhammad are joint chiefs of this district. Although to all appearances they are friendly there is no doubt that a consider able amount of ill-feeling*exists and that if it were not that they feel that we do not approve of any fighting amongst chiefs, they would soon find something to quarrel about. In February 1918, when the new line from Saldji Kaur to Charbar was being constructed, Mir Jan Muhammad of Nok Bundian, with an armed force, stopped the working party and only allow-ed work to proceed, when a promise was given to recommend him for a subsidy. On the return journey, in March 1918, he again was inclined to be truculent and would not allow us to replace my posts in his district with chandals. On the 6th April 1918, news was receiv- ed that his elder brother Mir Glul Muhammad (who really is responsible for that district) was murdered at the instigation of Din Muhammad who was annoyed at the treatment meted out to the construction party at Nok Bundian. Bahu District. Mirs Ashrat Khan and Ahmad Khan ruled this district till early in December when the former succumbed to influenza, his son Subhan Khan is now joint chief w r lth his uncle Mir Ahmad. There is seldom if ever any trouble in this district, as the chiefs are very quiet and treat their subjects with great consideration. Mir Ashraf had ceded part of Bahu district to Din Muhammad of Dashti ari but when the latter commenced to levy taxes, the former objected saying that as Din Muhammad had not kept hia promise the deal was off. In August 1918, Mir Ahmad Khan and Jalal Khan of Gwetter intervened and paid Din Muhammad Rs. 10,000. Previous to this a considerable amount of ill-feeling existed between Din Muhammad and the late Mir Ashraf. General. Great anxiety prevails regarding the harvest as there has been no rain. The people consequently fear famine. There is no fodder available, and cattle are in very poor condition. If no rain should fall within a short period the death rate among the animals will be very high. The whole country has been ravaged by the influenza and hundreds of people have succumbed, in addition to two of our subsidised chiefs Sahib Khan, and Ashraf Khan. Hot Bhai Khan, Azem Khan, son of Mahmud Khar of Dashtiari, and several other notables have died. In November 1918, shortly after the surrender of Turkey became^ known, Moulvi Abdullah of Hait preached a jehad and got together a following with the intention of committing fanatical outrages and let it be known that they would attack our camp and kill the telegraph officials. As the chiefs were not able to suppress the movement we had to return to Charbar and wait for a regular escort to continue the work. Our relations with the chiefs have been friendly. rFOK THE YEAR 1918. 39 CHAPTER VL atministration report for the arabistan consulate A EOR THE YEAR 1918. p ei . 80Ilnel&lt; Assistant Surgeon c. H.

The Post Office moved into the new office on 26th Pos1s ■ October, but the Telegraph Department liave not vacated the rooms in the Consulate yet, as the Telegraph Authorities were not satisfied and required further addition to the building. The work is being carried out by Civil Works, Basrah. The telegraph line between Mohammerah, Ahwaz, Shushtar, Dizful and Behbehan was not in any way inter- Teiegiaphs. fered with during the year.

One unit of refinery extension has been brought into effect at the end. of the year whereby an additional 4 million RefinerJ • ' gallons of crude oil monthly is dealt with. Further extensions are in hand but war conditions have hampered progress in this direction. Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, Limited, have during the current grain season held a contract from local resources for purchase of the whole of tlie Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force requirements ot wheat throughout the Karun and local districts. Some 2,500 tons have so far been purchased, bagged and shipped to Basrah. Messrs. Lynch Brothers, Limited, have carried on their work throughout the year. The Military Authorities returned Messrs. Lynch Brothers one of their tug boats in May which is now on the Mohammerah-Ahwaz run. Messrs. The Imperial Bank of Persia continued their work throughout the vear. Mr. A. L.

In July, His Excellency the Shaikh of Mohammerah generously made a grant of land for enlargement of the Christian Cemelery, ihcre being very little Tacant space for burials. The Military Authorities at Basrah made a special grant of Rs. 800 and also had a suitable enclosing wall built * 'ther improvements 'were carried out 'with funds contributed by le i er n firms.

Unfortunately Captain Edmonds fell sick on 1st May and had to be invalided and Captain Peel officiated from that date until the end of the year. Mr. A. J.

Sub-Assistant Surgeon Atta Muhammad continued to be attached to the Civil Hospital Ahwaz throughout the year. In Arabistan proper no events worth chronicling occurred during the Gen0raL year which was one of unusual prosperity and contentment. Shaikh Maula superseded Shaikh Mizail as the Chief of the Chaab Dubais Arabs near Shush. Prices ruled high during the early part of the year but came down with a rush when the harvest was assured. The Bakhtiari Khans have agreed to pay revenue on the whole of their Arahistan estates including Aquili and Ram Hormuz as from Nau Uuz 1919 Early in 1918 it was reported that the Direkwand tribes intended to ri . { , i T ., attack the «agwands under Sartip Khan.

As there was no further hostile demonstration the troops were withdrawn. Prom July onwards a fine of three tomans was levied on every load leaving for Khurramabad as a punishment for the big caravan robbery last year. Pour or five caravans went up using the Papi and Qalawand routes. The last caravan numbering about 1,000 animals left in July and used the Baharwand route. The Mir Ali Khani issued from Mungarreh and plundered the whole of the caravan which contained little Dizful or Khurramabad property and the Sagwands are reported to have recovered most of the loads. Thanks to the drastic treatment meted out to the Kalantar family last Shushtar. y ear j ^ iere ^ ave ^ eei1 110 farther distur bances in the town. Cordial relations were maintained by successive Assistant Political Officers with the Governor-General, more specially during Vikar-ul-Mulk's tenure of that office. The Miyanab Canal has been cleaned out at a cost of about 4,000 tomans which is gradually being recovered by the sale of the water. Subject to payment by the Bakhtiari Khans of the revenues of their Arabistan estates, the force of 50 Bakhtiari sowars formerly maintained in Shushtar has been allowed to return. Their pay is debitable to Arabistan revenues. Sardar Zaffar and Sardar Ashjaa continued to hold the office of Illkhani and Bakhtiari Illbegi respectively throughout the year. The beginning of the year found the Tehran Khans generally hostile both to us and to the policy of the Illkhani and Illbegi. The latter, whose hopes of material support from the British Government had been disappointedi ANNUAL REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY PYnressed their intention of remaining in the high country throughout the winter and their resignation would in all probability baye followed had not the Civil Commissioner promised them li iianciul assistance proTided thej started for the low country without delay A slight leaction in our favour occurred in March, when Sardars Jang and Assad piqued at the behaviour of Sardar Mohatasham who had deliberately spoilt Jang^s chances of getting the Isfahan Governorship, telegraphed to the Illkham and Illbegi urging them to siiDoort one another and promising to counteract the attempts of Samsam-us- SxUtaneb and Sardar Mobatasbam to oust tbem from office. Saidars Zaffar, Ashjaa and Eateh reached Ahwaz on the 16th April. Leno-thy conversations with His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul ensued the up- shot 'of which was that the Khans renewed their promises to protect the Oilfields and the Lynch road, and to expel hostile agents from Bakhtiari in retarn for financial assistance, and the loan of two mountain guns to enable them to punish the Kughilus. Considerable importance was attached to the projected Kughilu expedition since it would tend to divert the attention of the Khans away from Isfahan, where a Bakhtiari coup was feared, until late in the season. It was also essential to forestall the Kughilus who. were known to be contemplating raids on the Lynch Eoad on an even more ambitious scale than the previous year. Sardar Zaffar experienced considerable difficulty in collecting troops owing to the famine conditions prevailing in Bakhliari and the widespread belief that our guns would accomplish nothing against the Kughilu forts and that the troops would consequently return without pay or plunder. By means of threats and promises however a sufficient force was finally collected and the expedition left Ram Ilormuz for Behbehan on June 4th, accompanied by a section of the 31st Mountain Battery under a British officer, and by His Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul. The totallnumber of Bakhtiari troops engaged (including friendly Kughilus) was about 2,500, of whom 1.500 were Cavalry. The Illkhani and Illbegi remained in Behbehan, the actual commanders of the force being Sardar Eateh and Sarim-ul-Mulk who represented the Haji Illkhani and Illkhani families respectively. The expedition which has been fully described elsewhere met with the most gratifying success. Lindah the stronghold of the Taybi Garmsiri (Ali Muhammad Khan) was reached on June 17th and reduced after a short bombard' ment. During the ensuing negotiations a deputation arrived from Fort Eaisi, the stronghold of Ali Murad Khan of the Taybi Sarhadi, who have been responsible for most of the robberies on the Lynch Boad during the last 10 years. On learning of the damage done by our guns at Lindah, Ali Murad Khan decided that resistance was futile. The whole force moved to Zangul Shah within 8 miles of Baisi where negotiations were concluded. It was finally arranged that Raisi should be occupied by Bahmai and Chahar Lang chiefs on behalf of the Bakhtiari Khans for a period of six months with the proviso that if the requisite hostages were not forthcoming by a fixed date tbe fort should remain permanently in Bakhtiari hands. On July 14ith, while the force was camped at Churrum pending the settle ment of the Boir Ahmedi Garmsiri question news of the investment of Ahaden was received from Baghdad and His Majesty's Vice-Consul was ^ instructed to urge on the Illkhani and Illbesfi the necessity for taking all possible steps tor its relief. Captain Peel at once left for Behbehan, and in an ^ interview wit the Khans it was decided that the best course was to instruct Amir Mujahid and the Illkhani's sons to leave Chahar Mahal for Abadeh with 1,000 sowars. Telegrams to this effect were despatched to Isfahan, but in the meantime news of the relief of Abadeh was received. * The Illkhani and Illbegi had on this occasion offered to raise a for ce ® sowars for operations against the Kashqai or elsewhere in our interests a His Majesty's Government finally decided to take advantage of this otr The objects were three in number :—■ (1) to stabilize the situation in Isfahan ; (2) to maintain the authority of the Illkhani in Bakhtiari; and &lt; (3) to serve as a nucleus which could be doubled or trebled in em gency.FOR THE YE.xil 1918. 45 His Majesty's Vice-Consulleft for the North at the end of August and while at Chighakor arranged with the Khans for the raising of 500 sowars under Hahihullah Khan and Bahadur-us-Sultaneh, the cost bein 01 borne hy His Majesty's Government. These sowars were employed almost at once in expelling over 3,000 Darashuri families accompanied by Soalat-us-Sultaneh and one or two rebel Darashuri chiefs who invaded Bakhtiari in September while attempting to escape from the Illbegi of the Kashqai. By the end of September the question of the Isfahan Governorship became acute. The province had been disgracefully governed first by Shahab-us- Sultaneh, withMurtaza Quli Khan as a sleeping partner, acting on behalf of the Samsam -us-Sultaneh and Sardar Mohatasham, and later by Amir Mufakhkham. Brigands such as Jaffar Qali and Eiza Juzdani were all powerful in the district and it was obvious that a strong force was necessary to cope with them. This the Persian Government was unable to supply and it was therefore suggested that Sardar Zaffar might be given the Governorship while continuing nommally as Illkhani. This suggestion met with strong opposition from the Tehran Khans and for this reason was not received favourably by the Cabinet. During a visit to Tehran in December by His Majesty's Consul-General, Isfahan, the Vice- Consul, Ahwaz, and Sardar Zaffar it was found possible to effect a reconciliation between Sardars Jang and Zaffar as the result of which the former received Isfahan and the latter Yezd. _ Sardar Zaffar also undertook to place all the resources of Bakhtiari afc the disposal of Sardar Jang in Isfahan. The operations undertaken against the Kughilus had the effect of keeping Lynch Eoad. r0ac ^ open throughout the year and merchants were enabled to deal with the enormous congestion of goods which had been dumped on the road by mule teers during the previous summer. The keen competition among merchants to get these goods through to Isfahan coupled with the shortage of mules and the high price of barley in Bakhtiari caused a large increase in the rates of hire which averaged £150 per ton throughout the year. A contributory cause was the fact that in some cases British shippers consigned goods destined for Isfahan to more than one firm in Ahwaz with the result that merchants were bidding against each other for mules to deliver the goods of the same firm. Messrs. Lynch Brothers forwarded only 20,897 cwts. as against 46,964 G^ts. in 1917, but of the latter figure about 15,000 cwts. had been dumped on the road and only reached its destination in 1918. Drilling operations at Maidan-i-Naphtun have given the same satisfactory Anglo-Fersiau Oil Company. results aS in Previous years. To meet the increasing production, sites for new pumping stations have been determined on at Mulla Sani, Kut Abdullah and Dorquain where turbine pumpa driven by steam turbines will be installed. A new wagon road was started during the year between Baitwand and Maidan-i-Naphtun which when completed will be suitable for mechanical transport. The alignment has only two river crossings which will be bridged as opposed to some 30 river crossings on the old cart road. The scheme for the supply of drinking water from Ab-i-Gargar at Dar-i- Khazinah has been completed and a good supply of water is now available at Tembi and the Oilfields. Medical.

ADMINISTRATION HE PORT FOR THE MUSCAT AGENCY FOP THE YEAR 1918. Major L. B. H. Haworth, I.A., held charge of the office of Political Personnel. A^ent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul throughout the year. The post of Agency Surgeon continued vacant. The Senior Medical Officer, Bait-el-Ealaj, officiated in charge of the Agency and Telegraph IStair. o j Mr Siddiq Hasan vacated the post of Dragoman on appointment as Indian Assistant at Bahrain m April. He was relieved by Mr. Ehtasham -ed- Douleh. Sub -Assistant Surgeon J. P. MascareiQias remained in charge of the Hospital. Owing to the difficulty of finding any one willino- to come to Muscat, it was found impossible to relieve him during the year. 3 Monsieur Jeannier who had been French Consul in Muscat for nearly 8 years died m September. Monsieur Mateudi, the Warr/nt Officer in charge of tbe Prench coal godown, officiated as French Consul tin the end of the year Shaikh Abdul Aziz-er-Ruwahi continued as Dragoman. He was absent for some time on his properties in the Wadi Muawal. At the close of the year 1917, the Omani national party under their elected Condition Of country. Imam were in complete control of the whole of Oman proper, Shaikh Nasir bm-Hasmd, brother of the Imam, having been made Wali of the newly conquered Port and area of Rostaq the Sultan ruled on. the coast line where he could receive the protection of British support. There were constant rumours of differences between the Omani leaders for which there was possibly ground, but such differences do not affect their general policy or the stability of their alliance. Early in the war, probably in 1914, the Imam Salim bin Eashid-el- Kharusi wrote to the Imam Yahya and to Said Pasha in Yemen askino- them for assistance. In 1916 he again wrote to Yemen saying that he had written the previous letter, but that as, according to Oman custom the letter had not been signed or sealed, it perhaps had not been taken as authentic. It is the Omani custom to state who is writing the letter but to put no seal, indeed seals are possessed by few people. In 1917 an answer was received by the Imam and he gave out that he was expecting the arrival of 10,000 men from the Turks in Yemen, who it was stated were to come by sea. Three messengers, from Yemen apparentlv arrived in Oman having travelled by way of Mokalla and Sur. In March it was reported that ttree Turkish Agents were travelling in Oman trying to stir up the Omanis to attack the British. It was stated thaAhe leaders of Oman had no desire to come to conflict with the British. If, as is piesumed, these were the same people as those referred to in the precedino- paragraph, it is certain that the arrival of their 10,000 men would be awaitecL In the same month, Saiyid Nadir in the absence of the Sultan at Dhofar arrested four men from the interior who had come down to Muscat. Two of these men were connections of Shaikh Isa bin Salih and constant efforts have been made to induce the Sultan to release them. The Political Agent was approached in this reference also but refused to intervene as Shaikh Isa had not agreed to meet him to discuss matters. « Shaikh Isa bin Salih and four headmen of the Hurth (tribe of el Harithi) wrote to the Sultan letters on the subject w r hich were extraordinary in tone48 ANNUAL EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAI RESIDENCY considering the terms upon which they are. The letters might almost be described as humble. An incident of some gravity occurred at Sur in April One Hamad bi Salim-el-Arami, a man of some importance in the interior and an adherent of the Imam, came into the town under the Khafirat or tribal responsibility of Shaikh Nasir bin Ali of the Jennebeh. The Wali on hearing of his arrml sent some Askaris to bring to him both the visitor and ' Khafir. ' The man refused to come and a fracas took place in which both Hamad bin Salim and his Khafir were killed as well as the Akid (officer) of the Askaris and one or two men. The condition of Sur has generally been unsatisfactory, and His Highness was obliged to put a fine of dollars 7,000 on the place on account of the disturbances between the inhabitants. He can always recover such fines as long as he has our support since the people of Sur depend upon their dhows for a living and cannot trade without his passport. There have been continual rumours of attacks by the Imam on Sur Yankal or Baraimi. There is no doubt that the Government of the Imam' icunded as it is on Muhammadan religio—imperialistic ideas, wishes to bring all the country it can under its sway but its power for attack was, at any rate for the moment, used up in the taking of Rcstaq and a further advance wa» impracticable during the year for financial reasons.

The Sultan has Walis in the places mentioned below in Oman. All these places are sea ports with the exception of Boshar which is about 12 miles inland from Muscat towards the Wadi Semail.

His Highness left for Dhofar in his Yacht the ' Nur-el-Bahr ' on the 5th March returning to Muscat on the 10th April. His brother Saiyid Nadir acted for him as usual during his absence. His Highness' Yacht the ' Nur-el-Bahr ' was used a few times for purposes of cargo and made runs between Bombay and Bandar Abbas or Lingah theieby earning money for His Highness who, however, has not continued that useful employment as he considers it is below his dignity to use his Yacht for the purpose. As he rarely uses it for any other it is a mistake on his part not to turn her into a commercial vessel and give up the name of Yacht. As stated in last year's Administration Report in May 1917, the Political Agent submitted a report embodying a scheme for the better Government of Oman and for the provision of a force for the Sultan. The question was again taken up in July 1918 and, after a conference in fimla with Sir Percy Cox, the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf and Sir Hamilton Grant, Foreign Secretary, proposals were submitted by the Political Agent by which in return for a loan of SJ lakhs the Sultan should agree to make improvements in his administration by instituting a proper Customs service under the control of an official selected by His Majesty's Government by the -provision of proper Courts of justice, by the founding of schools on modern lines and by the formation of a levy corps under the training of Nalive officers lent from India, and under the supervision of a British officer. These proposals were sanctioned by the Secretary of State, in December 1918, .and were agreed to by the Sultan after the close of the year. The Acting Political Kesident in Baghdad then intervened and the matter is at present under further consideration at Baghdad, and by the Government of India while a suitable person to undertake the duties of Director of Customs is being obtained. The necessities of education have also been discussed and His Highness has agreed to open a^ school on modern lines. It is as yet early to speak of roads neither the administration nor the financial condition of Oman being on present lines equal to such a strain. After the close of the year also the Chiefs of Oman have, after many abortive attempts, agreed to meet the Political Agent, and it is hoped that clear issues may be framed on which the thorny question of the Government of Oman and our intervention in the matter may be definitely determined. Muhammad Eaimoo remained in charge of the Customs and has put them Cugtomg on a more businesslike footing than they have yet obtained. He is however unable to control the Sultan, who understands no finance, with the result that His Highness continues to draw cheques at random and consequently his finances are as embarrassed as ever. The Customs returns have been good and if Mr. Muhammad Eaimoo had no other business and were in a position to say No to the Sultan he would be, comparatively speaking, a good Customs Director. He is however a rich man with large business interests at Gwadur f u ?- arac .^ an ^ ori ty remain s four months of the year at Muscat.

A large number of these are in law British subjects as their grandfathers were such but it has not been customary in Muscat to register them. All or nearly all now desire to become British subjects, and it k a question which will require consideration on favourable occasion/ VsitWW doubtful whether it is legal to refuse to a man the right of registration when he po^esses the necessary qualifications under the law of the country to which he can claim to belong.

The question of a British Post Office at Muttra has se/veral times been h raised but has, owing to the war, been allowed to drop. The Muttra community are now anxious to rake the question up once more. The Sultan's consent having been obtained to the erection of a lighthouse the necessary arrangements were made by the Boyal Indian Marine for its erection on Muscat Island. The site has been prepared and the lighthouse was completed after the close of the year, but a pipe is awaited to put it in working order. In June red leading lights for ships were installed, one on the Consular Flagstaff and one on the wall of the pass behind. These lights have a bearing of 157° S. 25 E.

The Inland AV ater Transport Officer was transferred in November and the barge which had been used for supplying oil to paddle boats removed. A Marine transport officer was appointed to Muscat, the post being Nsival taken over on the 7th June by Engineer Lieutenant G. W. Hollings, R. I M.

Only one event worthy of record occurred on the coast during the year The Shaikh of Ajman committed himself somewhat heavily hv flogging and expelling a Persian subject for alleged adultery, then defending himself by alleging that this punishment was inflicted after trial by a Qazi, being well aware th^t the Qazi had found the offence unproven, though he was probably unaware of the fact that the decision had been given in writing. The offence against a foreign subject was in itself serious, and was much aggravated by the prevarication. He was called upon, on the next visit by the Peputy Political Resident, to restore the man's property, compensate him, and pay a fine of Es. ?i,000. The Shaikh was at first inclined to be contumacious, but capitulated on seeing a boat from the 'Lawrence' ostentatiously taking soundings to a point opposite his fort. He came off before the expiry of the time-limit, with the fine in full. The case was not a very serious one in itself, but in all these matters the attention of the Shaikhs is immediately attracted by any sign of weakness or indulgefice on the part of the British Government towards undoubted infractions of Treaty. The pearl fishery was moderately successful but trade was considerably hampered by the prohibition both of the import of coin for financing the fishery, and of the export of pearls from India. J. H.

ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ECU THE BAHRAIN AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1918. Charge of the Political Agency was held by the following officers for the Personnel. period shown : — Captain P. G. Loch 3 from January 1st to February 28th. CI. A. Mungavin, Esq., from March 1st to December 1st. Captain N. N. E. Bray, M.C., from 2nd to 31st December. Relations with Shaikh Isa have continued satisfactory with the excep- t ^ aittv r* v ^ -i ^i 011 fi ve matters, one of which was Shaikh Isa and A1 Khalifah family. ^ . . t i / i „ u during Uaptam Loch^ aud four in Mr. Mungavin's period. On January 17th, Shaikh Muhammad, second son of Shaikh Isa, returned from Lingah by S. S. ' OruraOn arrival the ship flew the Shaikh's flag and fired a salute of two guns when Shaikh Muhammad disembarked. On enquiry from the Captain of ' Orura ' who was new to the Persian Gulf it was found that Shaikh Muhammad had asked him to fire the salute. Representations were made to Shaikh Isa regarding the salute and his son sent in a letter of apology to the Political Agent. Two of these cases were an endeavour on the part of Shaikh Isa to assert his authority over Hasawis and r ajdis. In one case the Amir of Muharraq Island arrested and imprisoned Hasawis by order of Shaikh Isa who, on repre sentation, avgued that the Hasawis were under his jurisdiction but he was told that this could not be recognised. Shaikh Isa promised that this will nol; occur again and sent the Amir of Muharraq to the Agency to apologise to the Political Agent. In the other case the Amir of Manamah took a deposit of £4 from a foreign subject who was suspected of having pearls in his possession belonging to his nakhuda On hearing the matter the Political Agent sent for the Amir and recovered the money which was handed over to the man whose case was then dealt in the Agency. The Amir apologised profusely and promised to behave himself well in the future. In the fourth case the Wazir of Shaikh Isa at Buraidi interfered with the property of Mirza Abdur Rasul Safar, a British subject. The latter's Bahraini gardener w T as imprisoned and two airishes were pulled down. On interviewing the Shaikh regarding the matter His Excellency claimed that the huts had been erected on his ground. He was told that the huts were within the limits of the garden defined as Buraidi and that the case had been decided by Captain Loch and that he could not reverse the decision of his predecessor. His Excellency stated that he protested against that decision. I he Political Agent informed him that he would carry out any orders the Resident issued on the subject, but that he must insist on adhering to the judgment given. The airishes were subsequently erected in the same places and the Bahraini gardener w r as released. The fifth case relates to an assault on the Amir of Manamah by three Baluchi servants of Shaikh Hamad bin Isa. The three Baluchis were dragged and beaten on the way to the Shaikh's house and were flogged and beaten by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa's order. The dispute was between the youngest brother oi the Amir and the three Baluchis over some prostitutes. The Amir was alleged to hare ♦spoken roughly and abused the three Baluchis. On being asked to le ease the Baluchis Shaikh Isa stated at first that he would rather leave ■canrain himself than release two of the three Baluchis who were chained • q P or o hand them over to the Political Agency as they were born in BahrainFOR THE YEAR 1918. 55 and were in his service, and claimed that they were his subjects, but eventually His Excellency gave m and the matter was amicably settled. Six 9-pounder saluting guns were presenied to Shaikh Isa bin Ali by the Government of India for saluting purposes. Assistant Surgeon G. K. Monani was in charge throughout the period.

The Shaikh had not been able to find a Quarantine Medical Officer in Epidemic and quarantine. place of the late Dr. J?. K.. Poomla. The Assistant Surgeon in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital carried out the duties of the Quarantine Medical Officer in addition to his own duties during the year. Shaikh Isa has decided in consultation with the Political Agent to continue this arrangement until he can fine 1 a suitable Medical Officer. The Assistant Surgeon would be assisted by a Sub-Assistant Surgeon in the Hospital work. In November an epidemic of fever and influenza broke out which lasted for six weeks. There were about 1,500 deaths from influenza. Friendly correspondence on minor matters and giving news has been kept Bin g aud up with Ein Saud. Turki, eldest son of Bin Saud died of influenza in the 3rd week of December. The safety of the Hasa-Eiyadh trade route was maintained during the year. J. H.

A further sum of Es. 65,000 was subscribed by British Indian, Persian and Arabs for extension of and construction of U8toms ' shade on the Customs pier. The total length of the pier is now 825 feet. A sum of one lakh of rupees lias bteii spent up to date on the reconstruction and extension of the pier. In July the merchants were w r arned that the export of foodstuffs from India to Gulf ports was permitted only Prices of foodstulip. i? i i , • . ■ 1 - , , •/ tor local consumption in each place, and that if these goods are subsequently exported to other ports except under special permit from the Political Agent, it would become necessary to entirely stop imports and that goods exported without permit would be liable to confiscation. This order had a slight set back, but the prices rose from day to day owing to the difficult question of supply to the mainland which takes about one-third of the imports. The Ag3ncy is in a very bad state—leaks badly and is generally in a very ^ .... bad state—unless action is quickly taken Fmlding.^ to have j,. put into good COEdition ^ it soon be unfit for habitation.

In July, the Political Agent invited all the leading merchants of the place r , , , and explained to them the advartagesand Ttnera tra e. trade facilities which would be gained by them and the pearling fraternity by establishing a Bank here and asked them to sign on a list according to their wishes for or against the project. They all gave their consent willingly and Sbaikii Isa was approached on the subject. He readily consented to establish a branch of the Eastern Bank in Bahrain. Khan Sahib Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo, local news informant, had been very useful in making this project a success. In October, the Political Agent proceeded to Calcutta to consult the Director oi' Commercial Intelligence relating to the introduction of Indian x manufactured goods suitable to Bahrain market. The year's catch of pearls was, owing to continuous bad weather, less than the two previous years of 1916 and 1917, and the prices have been about the same as last season. The prohibition against the export of specie to Bahrain and pearls to Europe from India has had a marked effect on the local situation but the wealthy Arab merchants, who had large reserve funds in gold and who could easily afford to wait for their money, bought practically half the quantity of pearls. On the cessation of the hostilities there w T as a very heavy demand for pearls and the prices rose over 50 per cent, more than the previous year. In November and December all the Arab and Indian pearl merchants left for Bombay with £450,000 worth of pearls approximately which were carried in person while £61,000 worth of pearls were shipped. Total amoun shipped was £165,000. N. N. E. BEAT, Captain, M.C., Political Agent, Bahrain. \FOR 1 HE TEAR iQig. 57 CHAPTER X!. ADMINISTEATION KEPORT OP THE KUWAIT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1918. Political and Tribal— The name Kuwait is the diminutive of Kut and Intrcduction. means a small fort, it sufficient(y indicates , „ , l' lie . insignificant origin of the thriving town of Kuwait, the capital of the principality which now shares its name In old English records and books Kuwait is generally called ' GraSe'' o C 'Grane doubtless from the island of Qnrain, a short distance to the west of it. Boundaries . Tlle boundaries of Kuwait as defined m the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 are as follows :— The line of demarcation starts from the side of the mouth of the Khor Zubair towards the north-west and passes immediately to the south of Umm Qasr, SalVan and Jehal Sanam in such a manner as to have the wells oi these places in the Vilayet of Basrah ; arrived at the Batm it follows it towards the south-west to Hafar al Batiu which it leaves on the side of Kuwait: from this point the said line goes to the south-east leaving to Kuwait the wells of Es Safa, El Qaiah, El Ilaba, Wabrah and Anta, and joins the sea near Jehal Manitah. The islands of Warbah, Bubiyan, Mashjan, Eailakah, 'Auhah, Kubbar, Qaiu, Maqta and Tjmm-al-]\Laradim w r ith their islands and adjacent waters are comprised in Kuwait territory. As more than a petty town Shaikhdom the Sultanate of Kuwait is quite p ,, modern. The actual ruler, indeed, is only the third either to be generally styled Sultan or to claim a wider area of jurisdiction than the immediate neighbour hood of the fort and townlet which an ancestor, driven by the Turks out of his small holding at Umm Qasr on the Kb or 'Abdullah, built on tie south side of the Grane inlet early in the eighteenth century. Growth has been fostered by the increased trade of the Gulf since piracy was suppressed and the pearl- fishing industry encouraged and by the mferest taken in the place by all concerned in the question of the Baghdad Bailway's outlet on the sea. Nominally Kuwait was, until about twenty years ago, included in the Ottoman province of Basrah, the Shaikh . 0 ltica ' as de facto ruler being accepted by the Portias Governor de jure, and in 1871, wdien Midbat Pasha occupied Hasa, the then Shaikh subscribed to this interpretation of his status. But the Gov ernment of India, which had never accepted it, insisted on dealing with him directly when the Baghdad Baihvay question began to loom on the horizon, and ha? since supported his house against the Turks with whom the late Pultan, Shaikh Sir Mubarak-es-Sabah, K.C.S.L, K.O.I.E., repudiated all relations on the outbreak of war in 19.1 di. In 1899 the latter entered into an agreement ^ith us and four years later he accepted a British Political Agent at his court. He subsequently regarded himself as uader British protection, and made important exclusive concessions to us. In November 1915, Mubarak died and was succeeded by his eldest son, Rulei Jabir, who died in February 1917 and was in turn succeeded by his brother, Salim, the present ruler. The settled population of the Sultanate is estimated at about 65.000, of whom about 50,000 are rebident in Kuwait ' , opuaton. town. Of the latter about 25,000. are uwaitis, 15,000 Persian and Bahrainis and 10,000 Najdis, Bedouins an i natives of 'Iraq.i ■ U mt' I 1 ■ 58 ANNUAL REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY Two tribes, the Awazim and the Bashidah, together with a portioarft the Muteir form the bulk of the population Trlbe8 ' outside that of Kuwait town. Small bands of other tribes such as Dhafir, Beni Khalid, etc. (who are merely visitors), enter Kuwait territory at certain seasons. The principal villages in the district y^ith their approximate populations are Jahara, 500 ; Eantas, 400 • Abu VlUa g eB - Halaifah, 200 ; Fahaihil, 200 ; Shi'aibab 60. ' Tor a considerable time evidence had been accumulating which showed that Kuwait was being used as a base for Blockad0 - supplying goods to the Turks and to the tribes ran'id on the Turkish side and, at the end of 1917, it was decided that the establish nent of a blockade ai&gt;Kuwait was essential On January 4th, 1918, Shaikh Salim, the Ruler of Kuwait, agreed to our establishing a blockade for the control of experts to the interior, but a few days later withdrew his consent on the grounds that his honour and dignity would be affected and even a visit, on February 9th, from the Deputy Political [Eesident, Bushire, bearing a message from the Civil Commissioner failed to change the attitude of uncom promising opposition to the blockade which he had assumed. On February 10th, the S S. Zayani ' was ordered by the Political Agent, Colonel R. E. A. Hamilton, not to unload her cargo which was subsequently over -carried to Basrah An immediate improvement in the situation took place, and on February 16th Shaikh Salim accepted the blockade proposals without reservation. On February 22nd a British Blockade Officer, Lieutenant D. V McCollum, and four British other ranks landed at Kuwait to control the blockade arrange ments. Though this officer nominally received every assistance, cOBsiderable obstacles were placed in his way, and there was reason to believe that goods continued to leave Kuwait which was full of foodstuffs and piecegoods, but as the posts were manned by the Shaikh's retainers no proof was forthcoming though it was evident that while the personnel were Kuwaitis leakage was bound to continue. At the beginning of April several large caravans, aggregating 4,900 camels, purporting to be from Qasim and other eastern parts of Bin Sa'ud's territory, but in reality composed largely of enemy elements or traders with the enemy, and considerable numbers of Bedouin with some 3 000 camels had congregated at Kuwait, and asked for blockade permits to export very abnormal quantities of supplies of all sorts. After reference to Baghdad it was decided to refuse these requests with the exception of a few which were properly vouched for. On April 10th, H. M. Ships ' Lawrence' (Commander L. H. Crozier) and ' Bramble' arrived at Kuwait and the next morning the headmen of the caravans and tribes were summoned to the Shaikh's palace to receive the answer regarding the permits. The Political Agent and the Blockade Officer interviewed the Shaikh, informing him of the very abnormal quantities and kinds of goods exported in the preceding 15 months and of the still more abnormal quantities asked for by the caravans and tribes then in Kuwait. After some demur the Shaikh agreed to turn them away empty, but when the headmen were called in his resolution failed and the orders had eventually to be issued by the Political Agent, A letter was sent to Bin Sa'ud explaining the matter and asking him to come to some arrangement for the future regulation of traffic with Mr. Philby (an officer o the Indian Civil Service deputed to Bin Sa'ud from the staff of the Civil Commissioner) and each caravan leader was given a letter to the Amir (Governor) of his district explaining why he was bringing no goods. Dunng the succeeding three days the tribes and caravans left, always passing in of the Agency so that it could be seen that no goods were taken out. As a precaution in view of the large numbers involved, a machine gun was placed on the Agency roof and subsequently a second was mounted. On the last days news was received that the one remaining caravan was smuggling out arms an b I itleFOE THE TEA.R igig. 59 ammunition concealed in their saddles and a guard of marines and blue iaekets was landed and some ot the camels searched, but without success. The turning away passed off quietly and after waiting a short time to see if there was any chance of getting goods out by driblets the caravans betook themselves to Bin Sa ud complaining bitterly. Considerable resentment was aroused in Naid at the time but died down owing to the sensible attitude taken up by Bin Sa'ud who now has a properly accredited representative at Kuwait, to vouch for his caravans. At the same time, in order to avoid the occupation of Kuwait, it was decided to try to settle the Kuwait problem by buying up all the stocks held in Kuwait and to limit imports in order to prevent their being replaced The effect of the action taken on April 11th was that, on May 4th, the Shaikh wrote a letter to the Political Agent begging that Government would extend to him the same friendship and protection as bis predecessors had re ceived and pledging himself to complete responsibility for anything which mi^ht take place in his territory, while a marked improvement took place in the ffeneml attitude of the Shaikh s officials. The Shaikh's overtures were submitted to Government but, owing to some delay in their acceptance, the Shaikh irrew restive and the Political Agent was authorised, on June 3rd, to inform him that Government were giving his letter their friendly consideration and that it was hoped that Sir Percy Cox would deliver their reply on his return to Mesopotamia. The purchases on behalf of Government amounted to Rice Wheat Barley Sug^ar Coffee Pepper Tea 56,753 bags 1,640 „ 2,900 „ 7,805 „ 10,6(55 ,, 350 &gt;5 1,658 cases to a (ot il value of Ra. 26,52,943-12-0 but purchasing was stopped on June 2nd at the express request of the Shaikh to the Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah and the Political Agent as a personal concession lo himself. ' It was, however, found that such enormous orders were being placed in Iriaia and in other Gulf Ports to replace the stocks bought by Government that further action became necessary and on June 12th the Shaikh was informed that these goods could not be allowed to land pending the reply of Government to his letter and that the merchants could be given the option of shipping to Basrah under permit or selling to Government at cost price plus five per cent, any goods which the Blockade Officer considered should not be landed at Kuwait. On June 26th the S.S. ' Zayani' was ordered to over-carry her cargo which included more than 21,000 packages, mostly foodstuffs, for Kuwait. On June 24th the Political Agent represented that occupation was still the only real solution of the Kuwait question, but that if that were not teasible the Shaikh's offer must be accepted at once as any capital we might nope to make out of the acceptance would be lost by further delay : discontent was rife in the town among high and low and our failure to come to a decision was looked upon as due to the weakness of our position as regards the war. On June 28th the Government of India issued orders that the Shaikh's olier should be accepted on certain conditions, which decision was communi cated to the Shaikh in the letter quoted at length hereafter, while exports from india to Kuwait were to be prohibited except on permits signed by the 'ohtical Agent or his representative and such executive action as possible ^as to be taken to prevent exports to Kuwait from other Gulf Ports. The following statement of policy was made: 'while the Government of India appreciate the desirability of checking trade with Kuwait they do not consider this of sufficient importance to justify the risk of an open breach with the Shaikh and the consequent necessity of military occupation with its possible tar-reaching effect on other parts of Arabia.'60 ANNUAL EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GTJLE POLITICAL RESIDENCY On July 5th, the following letter (dated July 4th) was banded tn ^ ml Salim by the Political Agent 44 J/ler compliments.' —-I bave the honour to refer to Your ExMl letter dated May 4tb, 1918 — Eajab 24th, 1336, in which you^ ^ that since olden times there existed friendship full and n f 8 ^ between tire British Government and the Rulers of Kuwait tiine of your late father and brother and that you ask the H K Government to extend this friendship and assistance to you a 1 thai you therefore wrote the above-mentioned letter to say that v were ready to accept full responsibility on yourself personally to all that happened in Kuwait and its territories likewise and th f you will not allow any acts to be done in Kuwait or its territor? which may be against the imerests of the Government by an persons, either by your subjects or tribesmen or others who may come into your territories, and that you will allow no enemies of the Government to come into Kuwait territory : and that you v ill be personally responsible that no goods are sent to the enemies of the Government on account of the friendship between you and the Government and you request that Government will eive you the assistance of the officer now here as Blockade Officer to help you in dealing with this matter and that you wrote this because you desire that there should be nothing but friendship and the rights of friendship between the Government and your self. Your letter was communicated to the Government and on June 3rd. ^ Sha'ban 23rd/1 informed Your Excellency that the Hon'ble Major- General Sir Percy Cox was expected to return to 'Iraq altera short time and that I hoped that he would then deliver to you the reply of Government, v but he has been delayed and therefore the Government have ordered me to communicate their reply to Your Excellency and it is as follows :— ' The British Government have deeply regretted the events of the last two years at Kuwait but they welcome your declaration as afford ing an opportunity for the re-establishment of the traditional friendship between themselves and the Rulers of Kuwait and in order that there may be no misunderstanding in the future, they desire to explain their policy towards Your Excellency:— On the one hand, should you show to Government the same friendship • auc [ assistance which they have experienced for many years in their dealings with the Rulers of Kuwait, they will continue to you the assurances given to your illustrious father, the late Shaikh Mubarak as Subah, especially that 'the town of Kuwait and its boundaries likewise belong to Shaikh Mubarak as Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, and to his heirs after him' and will extend to you the friendship and protection and assistance which they gave to him and finally they hope that you will again raise the name of your house and of Kuwait to the high position which it held in the past in the eyes of the British Government and the peoples of Arabia. On the other hand it is the plain duty of the Ruler of a State which is on terms of friendship with the Government to prevent all acts either by his own subjects cr by other persons in his territory which may be contrary to the interests of the Government and since they know that, if you wish to do so, you have the power to contiol your subjects and others in vour territory, the Govern- ment will be compelled to hold Your Excellency personally lesj/Onsibie should any such act unfortunately be committed ^ u ^ ure ' r -lhey hope that you willfully realise your respon sibility as the Ruler of Kuwait towards the Government under w ose protection and friendship Kuwait has so greatly prospered m the past and will understand that that prosperity depends entirely on the preservation of true friendship both in word and deed with the Government. iiafeW 1 ■; mFOR THE TEAR 1918, 61 ^he Government have decided to remove the blockade provided that your Excellency takes measures of your own to prevent supplie 8 being sent to enemies of the Government and hope that in taking these measures you will not hesitate to consult the Political Agent and Lieutenant McCollum who will remain at Kuwait as his Assistant, but in order to prevent ill-disposed persons from endeavouring to smuggle goods, no goods will be allowed to leave India for Kuwait in future by dhow or steamer without the production of a permit signed by the Political Agent or his d^J Q authorised representative. Government desires that full consu^ a_ tion should take place^between you and the Political Ag en t regarding the quantities of goods required for your territory so that the legitimate needs of your people will be safeguarded a n( l permits will also be granted by the Political Agent for ^oods which may be necessary for lawful trade with the subjects of the friend of all Shuikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin ij Faisal as Sa'uc^ It gives me g^eat pleasure to be the bearer of this message on behalf of Government and I trust that the friendship between us may in crease This is what had to be said and may you be preserved.' In a long interview characterised by very plain speaking the various points of the letter w^ere discussed and the situation was made perfectly clear to Shaikh Salim, who vowed friendship and professed to consider Government's word as his law. He issued a notice proclaiming his friendship and that any one acting against Government in word or deed would have his property taken and be banished from Kuwait. He was rather frightened of personal responsibility and expressed fear of our listening to tale bearers on which point he was reassured. On July 7th Shaikh Salim replied in writing to the same effect and a meeting was held between the Political Agent and the Blockade Officer and representatives of the Shaikh headed by the latter's son, Abdullah, who was appointed to superintend the whole blackade and in particular to deal with exports by land. It was decided that a manifest system should be instituted to check the exports by sea and that the existing system of checking exports by land should be continued. Stress was laid on the point that far more good would be done by Shaikh xAbdullah going round Kuwait and turning out any enemy elements than by any amount of written passes. Though arrangements for the issue of passes were made immediately after the delivery of the above letter to the Shaikh (5th July), no applications for passes were received before September 2nd. This was due to opposition on the part of the Shaikh in the vain attempt of setting us to withdraw the restrictions on imports which we had just instituted. Seeing, however, that it was useless to hold out further he gave in and applications came forward slowly at first but freely afterwards. It is worthy of note that the opposition above referred to ceased a few days after the deportation Yusuf-ed-Duwairi (August 29th) elsewhere referred to in this report. Blockade restrictions were formnlly withdrawn on 3rd November under orders of General Head-quarters on conclusion of the armistice with Turkey, but the shipping restrictions as regards exports from India to Kuwait w r ere still in force at the close of the year. Por a long time it had been recognised that the influence of a man named . . Yusuf bin Muhammad al Minis (com- Importation of YuBuf-al-Duwa.n. YuSuf -al -Duwairi) Was One of the most anti-British forces in Kuwait and Shaikh Salim's succession placed bim in full power. He had acted as Shaikh Salim's jackal during the long years of his exile in the desert and received his reward in the great influence he exerted over Shaikh Salim and the power this influence gave him in the town where he was much disliked and even hated.&lt;&lt; 62 ANNUAL EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY No favourable opportunity was found of removing him till Shaikh S r made his declaration of July 5th, 1918, that he would banish anyone act ^ against the British Government in word or deed. On August 26th lie m ^ was broached and on the 27th Shaikh Salim consented to send Yus ^ T Dawairi to Bombay, where he was to receive quarters and a subsist! allowance ; the next d \y, however, he endeavoured to beg him off on va 6,11(36 pretexts and suggested among other things that he be sent to Bahrain or H 0U8 or to Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair to whom he is said to be related on the fernT side. The Civil Commissioner authorised the Political Agent to order fh Shaikh to deport Yusuf-al-Duwairi if his advice were not accepted and tele® 6 phed to the Shaikh advising him to comply with the Political Agen?' authoritative advice. ' The Shaikh was very unwilling: to take action ^ev 8 after the receipt of the Civil Commissioner's message but his advisers persuaT ed him that resistance was useless and Yusuf-al-Duwairi left in the U. vr &lt;?'

There were' only 328 boats trom Kuwait engaged in the fisheries in 1918 as against approximately 450, 500 and 600 in 1917, 1916 and 1915, respect ively. The decrease in the number of boats is said to be due to the usual crews from Basrah and Nejd not arriving as they had more profitable employment elsewhere. The takings were said to be only about three-fourths of what thev were in 1917. * An exceptionally good pearl, said to be about the size of a pigeon's eg® was got by Abdullah bin Yakut of Kuwait. It was sold to Hamad bin All Zayani of Bahrain for Rs. 1,10,000, who was subsequently offered Rs. 1* lakhs for it by Shamlan of Kuwait but would not accept it. The pearl is said to be worth Rs. 2,20,000= Reports are still being received from different sources about the smugo-l' Arms Traffic. of arms an(i amm unition from Kuwait into Tangistan on the Persian coast. On 4th October reliable news was received here that certain Tangistanis sailed from here the previous night with ammunition for Tangistan. On 26tli November the Vice^Consul, Bushire, was informed by the Provincial Director of Customs, Bushire, of a report received by the latter that 40 rifles and 50,000 cartridges from Kuwait were landed at Dilvar (Tangistan) about the 20th Novem- bei. Rewards have been offered here for the apprehension of arms smugglers, houses have been searched by the Shaikh in company with the Political Agent and the local Director of Customs is continually on the look-out, but up to t le piesent it has been impossible to lay hands on any of the smugglers. ItcvGnus. The Shaikh's principal sources of revenue are :—■ (1) Customs. (2) Pearl-fishery. (3) Private property. Revenue derived from the Customs has suffered a great deal in the year under review owing to the Blockade restrictions which were in force. To compensate the Shaikh for this, the Government of India gave him a present ot Rs. 00 000 and have foregone the loan of Rs. 1,87,500 which was gi^en him m 19lo for the erection of the Water Plant. Ihe Shaikh claims one divers share in each Kuwait pearling boat. The Shaikh owns several large date gardens at Fao and Basrah, which bring mm an annual revenue of about Rs. 7,00,000.

Shaikh Salim's reply to this I q T? 6 +T a8 i ^ advances t0 the Shammnr and 'Ajman and by the beginning of October m7, the latter had movec ^ masse into Kuwait territory. Much correspondence took place e w een e wo mlers, but Bin Sa'ud refused to restore the Awazim and when Colonel milton Political Agent, Kuwait, visited Najd, he claimed that he was within his rights in is action in connection with this tribe. He, however, knowing that he was in the wrong, expressed himself ready to return the filched tribe if Shaikh Salim would turn out I . . ^ an an(1 cut; ^ relations with the Shamraar, the enemies of himself and the ntish Government. Eventually an understanding was arrived at on these lines and the wazim we J e re turned. Respite this the'Ajman remained in Kuwait territory and, at the 0 '. e dl ' s P 0Sa ^ this tribe had become a burning question. In February 'R vVn WaS dec '' ed ^ rDOst satisfactory settlement of the matter would be for the ntish Government to take the 'Ajman under their protection at Zubair or elsewhere on n 8 d ** S A 1( ^ e and ' 0n March 6th, 1918, the following agreement was signed by e ohtical Agent (Colonel Hamilton), Shaikh Saiim- and Dhaidati Bin Hethlain (the leading Ajman Shaikh) :— r ^er.consulting the wishes of their fiiend and ally His Excellency Abdul Aziz Bin Saud of and Hakim of Nejd, Hassa and its Dependances. o paying due regard to the intercession on their behalf of His Exer llency Shaikh ^ a im al Mubarak, Hakim of the Sultanate of Kuwait and its Dependances, in whose territorv an under whose protection the tribe of ^Ajman are now dwelling, and having regard to the general P 0 hcy of friendliness of the British Government towards the mlers, tribes and people of raq and the Jezirat-al-Arab, it has seemed good to the British Government to overlook the reach of the agreement made last year with Sultan bin Hethlain and some sections of ti e Ajraan and to enter into relations with this tribe for the second time. Therefore, the British jovernment is willing- to accept the submission of the 'Ajman and to take them under itsannual eeport or the Persian gulf political residency protection for the period of one year or until the end of the war on the conditionff undermentioned— U) That Dhaidan Bin Hethlain, Sultan bin Hethlain and all the Shaikhs of the 'Ajman tribe now fettled in Kuwait territories do subscribe in writing to this undertaking. (Ji\ That the 'Ajman tribe will move its encampment to within territories occupied or administered by the British Forces and will settle in a locality appointed by the British Political authorities. (Hi) That the 'Ajman will not re-enter Kuwait territoiy or market in Kuwait (which must be regarded as absolutely out of bounds for the tribe), without permissioa of the British officer in political charge of them and after notice has been previously given to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. {iv) That immediately after the execution of this undertaking b? them, the 'Ajmau tribe will move in the direction of Zabair and await orders as to their destination. {v) If and when these terms have been subscribed to by Shaikhs Dhaidan bin Hethlain, Sultan bin Hethlain and other sectional chief of the tribe, the British Government will extend to them the same measure of protection and place them on exactly the same allowances as in the case of Ibn Suwait and the i&gt;hafir tribe. N ote .-It Bhould be understood that these restrictionB do not refer to individuals of the Ajman trib® such as Finawiya, pearlers, and others of the tribe engaged in Bimilir industries whose livelihood is obtained in Kuwait. But the prohibition is absolutely in regard to the principal Shaikhs, sections and their tribal followers. After some delay the tribe took up their residence at Shuwaibdah north of Zubair, but since then much raiding has taken pi ice between them ani the Mutair and Bani Hajir and they have also raided a namber of Bin Saud's caravans in Kuwait territory. Until the acceptance by the British Government in July, 1918, of certain friendly overt*res made by Shaikh Salim he did nothing to prevent this raiding in spite of the agreement on ihe subject. Bin Sa 'ud strongly resented this and represented that in this and other matters his interests were not being properly looked after by Government, and in August it was decided that a British post should be established to guard the Safwan wells, that Shaikh Salim should guard Jaharah and other Kuwait watering placas, while with his consent Bin Sa'ud was to be authorised to occupy Hafar on the boundary of Kuwait territory. In addition, hostages were to be taken from the leadinz Shaikhs of the 'A]man (and also from certain friendly Shammar who were implicated in the raiding) and further raiding be punished by stoppage of supplie-. It was, however, subsequently decided not to occupy Safwan nor to take hostages but the'Ajman were warned that if the raiding continued their small subsidies would be finally discontinued, they would be refused supplies, and thrown open to Bin Sa'ud's vengeance. At the same time Bin Sa'ud was informed that he was at liberty, so far as we were concomod, to take action against them provided the safety of the Basrah-Nasiriyab Railway was not endangered and hostilities with Kuwait principality were not involved.FOK THE YEAR i9 t 8. 67 APPENDIX II. THE AMERICAN MISSION. In two branches of their work in which the administration is concerned, viz., medical and educational, the American Mission has done splendid work in the past year. The medical work for men continues to show progress and this year has seen the doctor welcomed practically everywhere. The few men who held out against the mission so many years have lately opened their doors—the last surrender being Shemlan who has during the last two months availed himself of the services both of Mrs. (Dr.) Calverley on behalf of his harem, and of Dr. Mylrea on behalf of his small grandson. So that while last year's report read ' most of the men of influence in Kuwait make use of the Mission doctors', this year it should read ' Practically ali'. Shaikh Salim broke his long silence on October 11th when he at last called on Dr. Mylrea, inspected the hospital and took the doctor home to lunch with him. On December 14th the Shaikh accepted an invitation to lunch with Dr. Mylrea and afterwards presented him with a piece of land adjoining and to the south of the Mission compound. This piece of land which will be a valuable addition to the Mission's property was promised to the Mission some two years ago by Shaikh Jabir but Salim was in no hurry to fulfil his brother's promises. Shaikh Khaz'al of Mohammerah during his stay in Kuwait has been very friendly. He has given the Mission a special donation to be used in putting down clay on the roads bordering on and leading to the hospital. This will be a great improvement, for the deep soft sand was very trying to sick people walking to the hospital in the hot weather. Towards the end of October Kuwait was visited by an epidemic of influenza; hardly a house escaped and most of the cases complicated by pneumonia, terminated fatally. The estimated mortality runs as high as 4,000 —this estimate is possibly too high. In the month of November Dr. Mylrea made 238 professional visits. By the beginning of December the epidemic had spent itself. Hospital Statistics are as follows : — 2,992 New cases and 8,365 Repeat Treatments ; 379 Professional Visits were made to patients in their houses; 110 in-patients were received into the wards; 46 Major Operations and 148 Minor Operations; 5J Intravenous injections fcr Venereal Disease. The Dispensary for Women treated 1,300 New Cases with 2,387 Repeat Treatments; 70 Professional Visits were made to patients in their houses ; 8 In-patients were admitted into the Female Ward ; 7 Major Operations and 71 Minor Operations were performed.

On his return to Bushire, he discovered that his papers bad been tampered with and doubtless feeling his position untenable/ hastily decamped to Mohammerah. Yamin-ul-Mamalik, the new^ Karsruzar, arrived in Bushire in Deeember und to all appearances is most anxious to help and promises very well.

The beginning of 1919 found the Striking Force of the Bushire Field Bushire Field Force. I' 0 '® ** f ? r 88 Na » K»an had just fled Irom Kazerun with about 100 followers towards Jirreh. The last hostile encounter took place on 24th December 1918 in the Tang-i-Turkan, a case of long range fire with no casualties to the troops. The advance was slow owing to the necessity of eom- pleting a camel road up to Kamairj. /The Striking lorce moved to Eahdar m the middle of January and eventually entered Kazerun, on the 27th January. A few days previous to the entry of the troops in to Kazerun, Salar Mohtazid who had been nominated Deputy Governor, entered Kazerun from Shiraz safely. A day or two afterw r ards Colonel Orton, Inspector-General, South Persia Bifles, and Colonel Hotson, Consul, Shiraz, met Major-General Douglas, C.M.G., C.T.E., and Mr. Bill, Chief Political Officer, in Kazerun and the Bushire-Shiraz road became open and free, and to all intents and purposes the objective of the Bushire Field Force was accomplished. How r ever, the Striking Force stayed on in Kazerun for another three months during which small reconnaissances were made, notably to Jirreh and from Kahdar to Dasht-i-Arjan via Bui Hayat» mainly for survey purposes. Meanwhile Kasr Diwan who had been bombed several times remained in^. neighbourhood of Jirreh and stayed with Masih Khan Farsi Maidan, but engaged in no hostile actions. Towards the end of April the Bushire Field Force was evacuated and demobilized to India leaving garrisons on the roads as follows:,— bhiraz. 1 Battalion Indian Infantry. 1 Squadron tndian Cavalry. 4 1 Battery Mountain Artillery (less 1 section). Administrative Units. Kazerwi. 1 Battalion Indian Infantry. 1 Section Mountain Artillery. Bushire* 1 Battalion Indian Infantry, 1 Squadron Indian Cavalry. 1 Section Bushire Artillery. 1 Section Bushire Machine-gun Company. Administrative Units. A very modern fort was constructed in Kazerun. Posts of Jndian Infantry were established along the road and a system of tufangchis supervised by a British officer, Captain S. Clegg, South Persia Rifles, was inaugurated with the object of linking up the different posts of regular troops and to give warning of any enemy gatherings and to protect caravans from petty robberies. 1Km THE TEAR 1 9 19- 3 On the 27th April Major-General J. A. Douglas, C.M.G., C.T.E., handed oyer commmd to Erigadier-General A. M. S.

Nasr Diwan, his Farrash Bashi, and party arrived inShiraz on 12th April and took ' bast' vrith the Qawam and Ghazanfar-es-Sultaneb of Borasjun gave himself up to the Parman Earma on'ist June. Thus the only two rebels left in the field were Zair Khidhar and Shaikh Hussain. The General Officer Commanding, Bushire Eield Force, handed over Political control to the Deputy Political Ilesident on the 26th June and the office of Chief Political Officer ceased to exist. A motor road has been constructed from Borasjun to Rudak 6 miles from Kamarij, but owing to the withdrawal of the Labour Corps in June a gap is left between Rudak and Dasht-i-Arjan, though motors can and have traversed the rough military road in the gap, right through from Bushire to Shiraz. As a punishment to Kazerun for its former hostility and resistence to the Force, a proclamation w as posted that at harvest time a contribution and fine uf 5 per cent, of the barley crop would be imposed, but owing to a very severe visitation of locusts and hail storms which did great damage to the crops this proclamation was later rescinded and nothing taken. Wassmuss at the beginning of the year remained with Nasr Diwan near Jirreh, but left him for Tehran about the middle of March. The political history of the Bushire Hinterland, i &lt;?., Dashtistan, Tangistan D .. , , and Dashti is more full of incident, but ns ure m er an . the position still remains unsatisfactory. The source of all the trouble is the continued existence of the tw^o last remaining rebels, Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidhar. At the beginning of the year the Darya Begi supported by Indian troops and aeroplanes took military action against Zair Khidhar and drove him out of Khaviz and Hassan Khan's (our nominee) tufangchis w r ere placed there and still held the Khaviz-Ahram valley at the end of the year. The result of this expedition beyond the evacuation of Khaviz was practically nil. About the same time the Deputy Political Resident went to Khormuj with a large escort, taking with him Zair Abdullah, formerly head of the Customs House tufangchis, Bushire, and a Dashti by birth, the man designated by the Darya Begi to be Zabit of Dashti. The aged Jamal Khan was captured in Khormuj and Zair Abdullah installed in his place. He has managed to maintain him self there by the support of Faqi Zain-ud-Din, a kinsman of his, with 800 tufangchis, and he was able to remit the maliyah for the Khormuj valley north of the Mund river. He, however, was unable to bring the remaining Dashti Khans to order. Though they have not been openly hostile^ they have helped the rebel Khans with tufangchis, and have persistently refused to come in and meet the Deputy Governor or Darya Begi. In March Ali Khan, who had been put into Daliki in place of Nur Muhammad, having proved a failure was relieved of his duties as headman and Kal Ismail Hakim of Daliki was installed in his place. Early in April a gathering of local Khans was called at Borasjun to attend the ceremony of investing llaidar Khan of Hayat Daud witn the C.I .E. Twelve Khans, as well as the Imam Juma of Bushire and several tig Bushire merchants were present. After the ceremony the assembly were entertained to lunch, sports and a display by the Air Force. Such a gathering is unique in the history of South Persia. Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidhar continued their petty raids but on April 28th Zair Khidhar over reached himself. He occupied the village of Baghak 7 miles from Chagadak and the Railway. Early information reached Bushire and a column promptly made a night march arriving at Baghak early in the morning and surrounded the village. Out ol the party of 404 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY enemy, 8 were killed and 24* made prisoners, but unfortunately Zair Khidhar himself had left the village before the arrival of the column. This severe lesson stopped the rebels ' activities for some time. A short while after this incident Ghazanfar -es -Sultaneh was captured bv Agha Khan of Borasjun in Eariab, but was allowed to escape by his tufane- chis. He joined Zair Khidhar and Shaikh Hussain but a month later save himself up to the barman Earma in Shiraz, having no stomach for an outlWo life in the bills. 8 Early in June Asaf -ul -Mulk arrived in Bushire and took over the duties of Deputy Governor, Dashti, Tangistan and Dashtisfcan from the Darva Bed in whose jurisdiction these districts had hitherto been since his re-appomtment as Governor in October 1915. He took up his headquarters in Borasjun. In August Asaf-ul-Mulk accompanied by the Political Officer, Lines of Commu nication, and a strong escort of South Persia Bifies made a ten days' tour through Samal-Ahram to Khormuj and back. Shaikh Hussain and Zair Khidhar had written in to the new Depmv Governor that they were tired on their present life and wished to come in to him and make terms. They were given safe conducts and met Asaf -ul-Mulk and Captain .Eraser at Samal. However, their attitude was haughty and utterly unreasonable. They were prepared to dictate, but not to listen to terms, and would only come in and be obedient if both were fully reinstated in their former positions. • • falX ivO Negociations were broken off as it was evident that neither were in a sufficiently chastened frame of mind to be dealt with by anything but force. The second objective of the tour was to meet the 'Dashti Khans at Khormuj. This also failed as only two, Kfaalu Hussain of Daiyir and Ahmad Khan of Lawar met the Deputy Governor The others refused to come.in and submit. It was too hot to think of undertaking active military operations then, so action was deferred till the cold weather. When the weather allowed of active operations in November the Military authorities disagreed as to who should undertake the operation, neither the General Officer Commanding, Bushire Force, nor Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, beirg willing to move. It was decided that -Asaf-ul-Mulk should go himself to Khormuj and get hold of the Dashti Khans and thereby rut oil the rebels, lor as long as the rebels had the country behind them free, they could always disappear on the approach of any force, British or Persian. It was hoped that the Khans would come in and submit to Asaf-ul-Mulk, for the following reasons :— a ^ iaYe F ea ^ e dly stated that they will not come and submit to Zair Abdullah the Zabifc as they consider him beneath them socially, a refugee and not a Khan, but that they are prepared to submit to the Deputy Governor. 1 here is a certain amount of truth in their contention, so in order to give them a chance of showing whether ihey were in earnest, or merely making excuses, it w T as decided in consultation w ith His Excellency the Darya Begi o transfer Zair Abdullah, who was merely a temporary stopgap, and give him e Deputy Governorship oi Lingah, thus removing him with honour. t* i to be seen how successful Asaf-al-Mulk is in attracting the 1 asfhti Khans, but he had not achieved much by the end of the year. n 1 y iee ^ n o in August Zair Khidhar and Shaikh Hussaia had been told that their case was receiving attention and that they must await results.

The Darashuri were &lt;c yaghi ' though they never came into conflict with the Force. Ayaz Kikha remained with the great majority of the tribe in opposition to the Ilkhani Sirdar Ehtesham, while Nasrullah Khan who had been appointed Kalantar by the Governor-General of Fars, and who had the tribe snatched out of his hands by a coup d'etat on the part of Ayaz Kikha, was friendly. He, however, took no steps to try to get his own back again. In March Ayaz Kikha wrote in to the Deputy Political Resident to say that he would submit to any orders given him and Lieutenant-Colonel Gregson, C.M.G , C.I.E., was deputed to meet him in Lirawi and he promised to either go himself or send his son to Bushire. He sent his son to the Parman Farm a, though no settlement was made. The Ilkhani demanded his eldest son as hostage for the good behaviour of the tribe when he was with the Kashkuli in Shahpur. He sent his youngest son, but no settlement was made and matter stood as they were till all the tribes had migrated to their summer quarters when Ayaz K.ikha was reinstated as Kalantar aad still remains so. Early in March the Deputy Political Resident and the Darya Begi went to Bandar Asalu and met Soulet-ed-Douleh. He stated that he had merely- obeyed the orders of the Persian Ministers and leading Mullahs and therefore •should not be punished. He suggested going up to Tehran to submit to the Persian Government. J.t was not advisable that he should go by land therefore he was pressed to go via Mohammerah and Baghdad but he refused to go The Shaikh of Mohammerah then suggested that he should act as mediator between the Soulet and the Farman Farma but this was dropped as the Farman Farma objected. Finally it was settled with the approval of the Government of India that Soulet should deposit £10,000 in the Imperial Bank of Persia in Shiraz, should sign a bond on oath, not to interfere in tribal politics, send his son Nasir to Shiraz to stay with the Farman Farma and live quietly on his own estates. Sirdar Ehtesham toured from Firuzabad to Kazerun and stayed in the Shahpur valley some days before moving the tribes up to their summer quarters He was urged 'to take action against Nasr Diwan but refused, as he said he was too occupied with Ayaz Kikha and the Darashuri. The Farsimaidan, though they never actually took hostile action against the Force, harboured Nasr Diwan and his fellow rebels and showed their sympathy plainly. The summer passed very peacefully in Shiraz. There was considerable irritation and discontent among the tribes with the Sirdar Ehtesham regime, as he extorted more than the traditional revenue out of many of the tribes. The South Persia Rifles were about to settle down to a period of training when a mixed force under Lieutenant-Colonel W. A. K. Eraser, D.S.O., M .C., w r ere ordered to Ispahan to help the Bakhtiaris to deal with the famous robbers Reza Juzdani and J afar Quli. This expedition was a brilliant success resulting in the complete breaking up of the gang and the capture of the leaders, who were fiuhsequently executed, and raised the prestige of the South Persia Rifles very considerably. The column returned to Shiraz at the end of August. Nasr Diwan gave himself up to the Farman Farma in the middle of August. An arrangement was made under which he was banished to Darab for two years and the Qawam undertook to be responsible that he aid not leave the town. Muhammad Ibrahim, the Farrash Bashi, was arrested and imprisoned in the Ark and put on trial. This trial is still dragging on. The Autumn move of the Kashgai tribe to the Garmsir passed off quietly 'without any incidents of importance; this is doubtless due to the piesence of troops at Shiraz and on the road. Haji Seyed Agha Moin -ut-Tujjar, the Residency Agent, has been in Behbehan all the years. In May Nasrullah Behbelian - Khan went on Khairabad and was seized by Ali Bad Jalil, one of the Boir Ahmadi Kadkhudas, Muzaffar Khan came and6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GTJLl?

'1 his was brought about In the following way The fort of Deel held by Hidayatullah Khan, a partisan of Nasrullah, was handed over to Asad Khaa Bawi, tlie mediator between the two brothers. On occupation by Asad Khan Bawi, Nasrullah was set free and a few days later Muzaffar took over the fort from Asad Khan. Nasrullah came down to Busbire and was kept by the Eesidency for about two months. He then went to live with Asad Khan Bawi at Nimdur where his family were. A meeting was arranged at Khairabad |between the brothers to settle their differences at the end of November. Muzaffar Khan arrived but Nasrullah Khan at the last moment shied off. Hayat Daud has remained as usual a pattern of wise rule and peacefulness. Haidar Khan, C.I.E., continues to give^ell Hayat Daud. balanced and very useful advice on ail ques tions relating to the hinterland, Behbehan, etc. The Bushire -Borasjun Eailway, at first used entirely for military purposes was opened to passenger and goods traffic Eallway • early in April.

Passenger .... .... 1,51,384 Goods 2,30,139 : a Total . 3,81,523 The Eailway was not used at first as freely as was expected, owing chiefly to the conservatism of the merchants including the British firms. However, from the beginning of 1920 the Eailway are eoing to accept responsibility and erect goods sheds and extend siding to the New Customs which will attract goods. A Eoyal Air Force flight of E. E. 8 machines has been in Bushire throughout the year. They frequently co-operated with troops, carried out bombing raids and did a certain amount of photographic work.

Kohandal Khan proceeded on two occasions on leave to Bandar Abbas for a period of about four months leaving a relative of his, Najaf Quli, in charge. The attitude of Kohandal Khan towards this Vice-Consulate has been dis tinctly unfriendly during the second half of the year This was due for the most part to the check put on hitn by His Majesty's representative in his in terference with the duties of the new Finance Agent. His attitude towards the latter has been hostile from the start and he has done his level best with intrigues both with Shukruliah's Chiefs at Bushire and with the Finance staff here to effect his dismissal. Kohandal Khan's administration of his own department is corrupt in the extreme with the result that he is weli hated by all sections of the community Haji Ahmed bin Yusuf Khawja continued to act as agent for His High- Foreign representatives. ncss the feultan cf Muscat during the year.

His attitude, how r ever, took a sudden turn after the publi cation of the terms of the Anglo-Persian Agreement in August, when he rapidly became a professed pro-Britisher, and frequently expressed deep chagrin at not being in Tehran where he could have been of great service to the British in arranging tEe new Tariff.

There was a falling off in imports and exports during the calendar year as compared with 1918. This is chieflv Trade nnd Commerce. i ji px ji j _ ji' attributable to the tact that the caravan traffic on the Bnshire-Shiraz Eoad, which had been interrupted for several years, was again resumed.

The export carpet trade was brisker than in 1918, owing to greater facilities in shipping offering. In this connection a certain amount of trouble was experienced owinff to the Customs authorities maintaining that 60 per cent, of the Kerman carpets contained aniline dyes.

It is also hoped that this will synchronise with any other reforms which may be introduced in connection with the new agreement. Sixty-two slaves applied for manumission during the year. Out of these SIave8 fifty-one were manumitted, eight returned to their masters and three cases were awaiting settlement. The agreement was generally well received, but all sections are rather Angio-Pereian igremeM, impatient to see the results materialise, one of the chief being the reorganisation of the Customs Tariff and the establishment of roads and railways. The publication of the terms, at once demonstrated the whole-hearted dislike by one and all for the Belgian Customs officials. There was a general feeling of rejoicing because it was calculated that one of the first results would be the advent of British Customs officials into Persia. The past year has been a bad one for the poorer section of the local Ecouomic conditions. community, as prices generally have had a tendency to soar higher than at any previous time. This was partly due to scarcity of rain during the year, and also to a very great extent to the fact that the export from India of most essential articles of staple diet such as rice, wheat, and flour are only permitted to a very limited degree under special license. A pomparative list of prices is appended from which it will be seen that the prices of the three most essential commodities have almost doubled themselves since last year. G. A. G.

E. ; MoConaghey, C.I.E.. throughout the J J year. Mr. C. P. Skrine, I.C.S., held charge of the appointment of His Majesty's Vice-Consul, Kerman, from the beginning of the year till forenoon of 17th March 1919 from which date Khan Sahib Abdul Alim acted as Vice-Consul, in addition to his other duties, until the arrival of Major A. J. H. Grey in November. Khan Sahib Abdul Alim held the appointment of Extra As &amp;istant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf throughout the year. Political History. Persian Officials. —His Excellency Abdul Fateh, Tabatabai, Hishmat-ud- Gcvemor-Genei ai . Dauleh has held the post of Governor- (jrenerai throughout the year. During this period his relations with the Consulate have been of a most cordial and helpful nature. His attitude towards iSardar Nusrat, Sardar Mujallal, and other officials and notables in the Province has. on the whole, been satisfactory. He has loyally kept to his agreement not to replace the Deputy Governors of Bam, Sirjan and Baft, without the concurrence of His Majesty's Consul, In his dealings with the British officers and all ranks of the South Persia Rifles Hishmat-ud-DauIeh has shewn a friendly spirit, thus enabling matters to run smoothly. He is shrewd, tactful and of a pleasant personality, but somewhat weak. His regime has been popular with all classes and he has earned the reputation of being far less rapacious in his demands than former Governors. As long as Hishmat-ud-Dauleh maintains this satisfactory attitude, every effort should be made to retain him as Governor-General of Kerman. Muntazim-ud-Dauleh, Deputy Governor of Kerman, has always shewn a Deputy Governor. desire to maintain friendly relations with the Consulate. Sardar ^usrat, Commander-in-Chief of the Persian Army, is the leading Commander-in-Chief of the Persian Army. rotable in the Province and ^S SUCh wields great local influence, and in addi tion his relations also hold several important appointments in the Province. His relations with the Consulate have been of an extremely friendly nature and he has been always willing to assist His Majesty's Consul in every way possible, His chief work duiing the year has been in connection with the elections, in which he successfully brought about the election of Moderate candidates throughout the Province. Saidar Mujallal, Deputy G overnor of Bam, has great influence in Bam and sardar Mujaiiai. Naimashir and to some extent in Persian . _ Baluchistan. Throughout the year, his reialious with His Majesty's Consulate have been of most cordial nature. In Mai eh, he succeeded in bringing about a satisfactory settlement with IS'a^ab Khan Baraeri in connection with the murder of the late Kessaidar Ahmad Yar Khan. He has also rendered great assistance to the Officer Commanding, ^outh Persia Rifles Detachment at Bam. In August, the news of the Anglo-Persian Agreement reached Kerman Apgio-Persian Agreement. ari( ^ was ^ost enthusiastically received by the Governor-General, Persian officials, notables pml all classes £)f the people. Notices containing the terms of the irea y and the Prime Minister's speech were locally printed and issuedFOU THE TEAR ^l 9 - 21 throughout the Province. Up to date, there has been no hostile movement in the Province against this Agreement. In August 1918, the Governor-General received orders to hold elections Elections. for thG Province. The first step taken ■ by the Governor-General was to call a meeting of the various^classes for the purpose of appointing an Election Com mittee. At this meeting, the lurge majority oi those present were Democrats. Proceedings were lively, wild speeches being made by Sayid Kazim and one or two other Democrat delegates recently returned from Tehran, who inveighed in their usual style against foreign and domestic enemies of Persia, who have hanged, shot, deported and fined J£ermani patriots wholesale since 1916. After several meetings and discussions with Governor-General and Sardar Nasrat, the following were appointed members of the ' Anjuman-i-Nuzzar — Mukhtar-ul-Mulk. Asaf-ul- M amalik. Shariat Madar. Sayid Jawad. 8heikh-ul-Mulk. Agha Ali Karuli. Mirza Lutf Ali Khan. The rival parties are Moderates and Democrats. The number of members to be elected for the Kerman Province is three for the T^own, including one Parsee Member, and one each for the following districts :— Sirjan and Aqta Afshar. Bam and JSTarmashir. Jiruft and Rudbar. Rafsinjan and Zerind. At first, the Moderate party shewed little signs of taking any interest in the forthcoming elections. In January 1919, owing to renewed pressure from Tehran, the Governor- General was obliged to hasten on the elections. Owing to the jealousy exist ing between the * Sheikhis' or * Khanzada ' and connected families, and the 'Balasaris' or the descendants of Vakil-ul-Mulk with their adherents, no good headway was being made by the Moderates. After several negotiations with Sardar Nusrat and Mukhtar-ul-Mulk, the head of the Khanzadas, His Majesty's Consul succeeded in bringing about a compromise. This important point having been settled, the next step was to select the proposed Moderate candidates. Pinally, the Moderates decided to run the following candi dates :— Haji Mirza Murteza Asaf-ul-Mamalik Mnshar-ul-Mulk. Adl-us-Saltaneh. Rafat-ud-Dauleh. Shariat Madar. For Town. For Sirjan and Aqta Afshar. For Bam and Narmashir. For Jiruft and Rudbar. For Rafsinjan and Zerind. The Election Proclamation for the Town was issued on the 16th of Janu ary and polling was completed by 17th February. The Democrats, who at this stage recognized that they had little hope of winning the elections, tried by every means in their power, such as ' basts , etc., to upset the Anjuman -i- Nuzzar. All their efforts failed and finally the following two Members were elected for the Town :— Haji Mirza Murteza ...... 6,999 votes. Aaaf-ul-Mamalik . » • • • • r 6,630 ,,% 22 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY The next step was the elections in the various districts of the Province. These elections were carried out successfully through the endeavours of Sardar Nusrat and friendly Deputy Governors, and finally the following Moderate Members were elected : — Mushar-ul-Mulk. Adl-ue-Saltaneh. Rafat-ud-Dauleh. Shariat Madar. From Sirjan and Aqta Afshar. From Bam and Narmashir. From J iruft and Rudbar. From Rafsinjan and Zerind. The final result of the elections was the complete overthrow of the Democrat party, who had held sway in this Province since the commencement of the Constitutional Government. Outbreak of War with Afghanistan and Democrat Activities. • About the middle of May, the news re hostilities with Afghanistan was made public. On receipt of this news, the Governor-General, local officials and notables did not hesitate to express their dissatisfaction at the attitude of Amir Amanullah Khan. The Democrats in Kerman again became active using as their planks the disturbances in Egypt, India and Afghanistan, and were busy spreading every kind of rumour, such as the disbandment of the South Persia Eifles, that several British officers and soldiers had been killed whilst trying to break in the Holy Shrine of Imam Eeza in Meshed, and that a party of British officers and men had been killed in Kerbela in Mesopotamia. The Democrats endeavoured to ferment riots and to close bazars. His Majesty's Consul persuaded the Governor-General to take strong steps to stop those troubles and to deport Muin-ush-Shariya and one or two other leading Democrats, The news of the signing of the Peace with Afghanistan was circulated throughout the Province and His Majesty's Consul received numerous letters of congratulations. The failure of the Democrats in elections and their inability to cause trouble during the abovementioned period has greatly reduced their influence. At one stage, there was some anxiety re the safety of Mr. Medcalf, Inspector of the Dehaneh Baghi, Bam Section of the Indo-European Tele graphs. Portunately no untoward event occurred and no damage was done to the Telegraph line. Mujallal-us-Saltaneh has held the post of Karguzar throughout the year K a ri?u Za r an ^ 'work durinff this period has on the 8uzar - whole been satisfactory, Revenue and Grain. —In March, Muhandis-ul-Mamalik, the Eevenue Agent, arrived in Kerman. , ^ July the prices of grain began to ^show a tendency to rise, owing to ne rollowing reasons :— (i) that the harvest had been a poor one, {ii) that the an downers still expected that the South Persia Hifles would come into the market for the purchase of grain, and {Hi) that the Governor-General had suc- C r e /r P obtaining permission from the Persian Government for the purchase ot tne Revenue grain of the Province. The disposal of the Eevenue grain las, as usual, caused several contradictory orders issuing from th6 evenue Minister, Tehran. The first order received from the Bevenue Mmister was that the Revenue grain should be sold to the Governor-General at tne lollowmg rates;— Kerman Town and Environs • . .12* Tumans per Kharwar. Nearer districts . , ci Distant districts, like Bam and Narma- ' 4 -.1, .• ' X 5) J1TOR THE TEAR 1 9 19. 23 These orders were subsequently cancelled and thia action of the Revenue Minister naturally irritated the Governor-General, who in turn laid the blame on Sardar Nusrat and Muhandis-ul-Mamalik. Einally, after further protracted correspondence between the Governor-General and the Revenue Minister, the Revenue grain was for a second time handed over to the former. Unfortunately, this trouble resulted in the recall of Muhandis-ul-Mamalik who since his appointment appeared to have carried out his work well. The Governor-General promised His Majesty's Consul that he would utilize the Government grain to keep down the price of bread and it remains to be seen whether he will carry this out or not. Fortunately, the South Persia Rifles have large stocks of grain and will not come into the market during the present year. At the present time, the rate of bread is Krans 2-60 per Kerman maund of lbs. The practice of selling the Revenue grain to the Governor-General is open to many objections/such as considerable loss to Government revenues, dear bread, and constant friction between officials, etc. It would be advisable, in future, to resort to the old practice of allowing the Revenue Department to arrange for its disposal. Mirza Assadullah Khan, Kurdistani, arrived from Tehran on 11th March Opium Department, ?p d took over charge of the Opium Department m Kerman, as Toumaniantz's agent. In the beginning of August when he had just started a Company for the sale of opium and also had arranged for the Isetter administration of his Department, orders for his dismissal were received. These constant and ancalled for changes are the bane of the Persian Administration. His Majesty's Consul has a clear understanding with the present I) . str . cta Governor-General that no change should be made in the Deputy Governorships of the following three districts, without the concurrence of the Consulate, viz-:— (а) Aqta Afshar, (б) Sirjan, and (e) Bam and Narmashir. In practice, also, the Governor-General has consulted His Majesty's Consul re the appointment of minor Deputy Governors. Asaf-ul-Mulk held the post of Deputy Governor of this district up till September and was then relieved by q a s ar ' Mirat-us-Saltaneh, son of Sardar Nusrat. Shortly after Mirat-us-Saltaneh's arrival, in Kerman from Tehran, the Governor-General and Sardar Nusrat approached His Majesty's Consul re this appointment. At that time. His Majesty's Consul personally knew little of Asaf-ul-Mirlk's work or capabilities, and asked that the question might be left over till he had opportunity of visiting the district. In August, when His Majesty's Consul visited Aqta Afshar, he found that Asaf-ul-Mulk was by no means a good Governor, and that a change was desirable. The most important tribe of the district is the Afshars. The Ilkhani of the tribe is Hujabr-us-Saltaneh. His summer headquarters are at Hushun and winter headquarters at Urzu. The tribe is divided into the following four sections, vim :— (1) Ali Ghazalu, or Ilkhani, (2) Amooi, (3) Jallalu. (4) Kasimlu. Thromghout the year, the behaviour of the tribe has been good. In August His Majesty's Consul paid a visit to the Ilkhani at Hushun and was cordially received by Hujabr-us-Saltaneh and the leading Raises of the tribe. The present Ilkhani is an oldish man without any great force of character, and said to be addicted to opium smoking, and in 1918, owing to the death of the well -known Gunj Ali Khan, was appointed Ilkhani by the present Governor- General. In September 1919, the Governor-General w T as anxious to appoint Salar Ashayir as Ilkhani but was persuaded by His Majesty's Consul not to make this change as the tribe apparently did not desire it. (Vbb)24 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY The chief Rais of the Amooi section is Mohamed Khan, Saulat-us-Sultan, and is the nominal Ilhegi of the Afshar tribe. The chief of the Jallalu tribe is Salar Ashayir, who is clever and well- intentioned. The chief of the Qasimlu section is Ahmad Khan. Lately the Ilkhani was anxious to replace Ahmad Khan by his own brother Dora.n Khan, but as the former and his family had held the Sultanship of this section for many years, ED's Majesty's Consul advised the Governor-General not to support the wishes of the Ilkhani in this matter. The Afshar tribe consists of over 2,700 houses with an estimated fighting strength of one man per house. Nasir Nizam, the son of the Ilkhanis is the head of the Afshar section of the South Persia' Eifles. Baft levies which have lately been reduced to 40 Tufangchis. Medhi Khan, the youngest brother of the Ilkhani, has lately joined^the South Persia Ilifles as an aspirant and several Afsharis are serving in the South Persia Rifles. Mirza Mahmud Khan has held the post of Deputy Governor throughout the year and has worked well. His Su ' ; ' an ■ relations with the South Persia Eifles have been most satisfactory. The chief tribe of the district is the Buchaqchis, under Murad Khan, Shikuh -us-Sultan, and throughout the year this tribe has behaved well. The nominal chief of the tribe is Hussein Khan, who fled to Tehran after his most treacherous behaviour in Saidabad in 1916. Hussein Khan is most anxious to return to Kerman. The matter is under discussion with His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. The Deputy Governor of the district is Sardar Mujallal. Throughout the year, the district has suffered little Bam ana Nanr.asW. from Baluch lawlessness, chiefly owing to the presence of a strong Detachment of South Persia Rifles. In March, the case arising out of the murder of the late Ressaidar Ahmad Yar Khan was settled satisfactorily and Nawab Khan ' Bameri ' paid a sum of Tumans 1,000 as compensation for the murder of the late Ressaidar Ahmad Yar Khan. In Pebmary, His Majesty's Consul visited Bam and w^s the guest of Sardar Mujallal. The Deputy Governorship of the district is entrusted to Sardar Nusrat, Jiruffc whose son Adl-us-Saltaneh held the post of Deputy Governor till his departure to Tehran in October as a member of Parliament. Muhtashim-ul-Mamalik, a nephew of Sardar Nusrat, was appointed to succeed Adl-us-Saltaneh. Sardar Nusrat and other landowners have lately been complaining re the encroachments of Zargham-us-Saltaneh in this district, which have been going on for the last six or seven years. The Governor-General and His Majesty's Consul have communicated with the Zargham on this subject and the latter has come to an understanding with Sardar Nusrat and it is hoped that the situation will now improve. Zargham-us-Saltaneh has held the post of Deputy Governor of Rudbar Iludbar for many years. Throughout the period of the war, Zargliam has kept his district in good order, in that he has permitted no caravans passing through Rudbar to be looted and has also willingly rendered assistance to British officers travelling through his district. In February, Bis Majesty's Consul paid a visit to Zargham at his headquarters in Kahnu and was most cordially received. 'With the approval of the Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf a present of 1,000 Tumans was given to Zargham by His Majesty's Consul. The Zargham is too independent a Deputy Governor to please the Governor- General and the latter is consequently making frequent complaints against the Zargham to His Majesty's Consul, the chief of which is inability to recover full revenue. On this point, negotiations are still in progress and a satisfac-- tory result is hoped for.FOR THE YEAR i9i9- 25 The Zargham spent several years of his younger days in Persian Mekran and in habit and appearance is more a Baluch than a Persian. One of the chief friends of the Zargham is Saulat-nn-Nizam, Sub-Deputy Governor of Rabur, who has and is assisting His Maiestv's Consul in his « , • • i 1 i.1 r7 1 w */ ^ ^ A-LJ-O negotiations with the Zargoain. The other districts of the Province call for no particular mention. The Deputy Governorships of Rafsinjan, Khabis and Zarind are generally held bv the members of the Khawanin family. Matters in Persian Baluchistan require careful consideration. In March Persian Baluchistan. •^ s . Majesty's Consul was able to discuss this question with the Deputy Poli tical Resident in^ the Persian Gulf at Bandar Abbas. The result of this discussion was tnat, unless the Government of India m ere willing to press matters, the best solution would for the present be to iivide Persian Baluchistan into two political spheres (1) for the protection of the Coast Line and Tele graphs, (2) for ihe protection of the Kerman Province. The first to be carried out by a representative at Charbar with powers to deal with the tribes as far as Geh, Kasarkand, etc., and the second by the re-establishment of Vice-Con sulate at Bam with a strong Detachment of ^onth Persia Rifles. The chief points for protection from Baluch lawlessness as far as the Kerman Province is at present urgently concerned, are ;— {%) Protection of the fertile regions of Jiruft, Narmashirand Rudbar ; (n) Communications between Bandar Abbas and Kerman ; [%ii\ Protection of the important Telegraph line running between Dehaneh Baghi and Bam. In May, Mir Bahram Khan of Bampur sent a small deputation to Kerman in order to interview ihe Govern or-General of Kerman, with the object of obtaining the Deputy Governorship of Persian Baluchistan. This deputation was received by the Governor-General in a firm but friendly manner and the latter invited Bahram Khan to meet him in Bam and Narmashir at a suitable time to discuss matters. His Majesty's Consul also impressed on the deputa tion to warn Bahram Khan that raids in Narmashir, etc , would not be put up with any longer. The deputation was shewn o\er all the lines of South Persia Rifles and was duly impressed. The Governor-General reported the matter in due course to the Persian Government. His Majesty's Consul had hoped to meet Political Agent, Chagai, at Rigan in November to discuss generally matters in connection with Persian Baluchis tan, but unfortunately this meeting fell through owing to the inability of the Political Agent to cany out his proposed tour. Duiing the year, the Baluchis ow T iog to the continued occupation of Khwash and to the presence of a strong Detachment of South Persia Rifles at Bam have given no serious trouble. The Governor-General is naturally anxious, and more so since the Anglo- Persian Agreement to re-establish Persian Government's authority over Persian Baluchistan. The whole question bristles with difficulties and His Majesty's Consul is of opinion that the first move on our part should be the re-estabiishment of Bam Vice-Consulate, w r hich question is now under the con sideration of His Majesty's Minister and of the Government of India. Condition of Roads. The main trade routes from Bandar Abbas to Kerman are :— (1) Bandar Abbas -Gakum-Saidabad-Kerman. (2) Bandar Abbas- Daulatabad-Baft-Kerman. (3) Bandar Abbas-Rudbar-Jiruft to Bam and Kerman. The main internal routes are :— («) Kerman to Yezd via Bahramabad. {h) Kerman to Meshed via Rawar and Naiband. (c) Kerman to Bam. [d) Kerman to Birjand via Khabis.26 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY 1. Banddr Alias-Oakum-Saidahad'Kerman.-JYhxs route is used by the Military authorities for convoys for Shiraz and Kerman. In March last, the Groverrimeut of India, owing to necessity for retrenchment of expenditure, stopped all work on this road. His Majesty's Consul supported by His Majesty's Minister and the Depuiy Political Besident urged, without success, that this road might be completed before the Labour Corps were withdrawn, in order to get some return for the great expenditure already incurred on the construction, of this road. The following sections still require completion (i) Kalakun, (ii) Tang-i-Zagh, (m) Gakum-Hajiabad, and for the completion of which skilled labour will be required.

Bandar Ahhas-Daulatalad-Baft-Eerman. —This is the trade route universally used by local carriers, except during the months of January and February. Supplies and grazing are procurable throughout the route. The telegraph line from Bandar Abbas to Kerman runs along this route with telephone stations at Daulatadad, Deh Sard, Baft and Chari. The telegraph stations at Baft was reopened in December. The post also travels alon^ this route. During the year, trade has been greatly hampered by the constant rafds of the Arab tribes under the jurisdiction of His Excellency Qawam-ul-Mulk. In May, the following arrangements were sanctioned by the Inspector- General, South Persia Rifles, for the protection of this road, and since then an extra 20 Tufangchis have been added.

His Majesty's Consul, Shiraz, from time to time has sent information that the Qawam is dealing heavily with these robber bands. In addition, Asaf-ul-Mulk, Governor-General, Kerman's representative, accompanied by representatives of merchants and local carriers, has lately proceeded to meet Qawam at Darab, in order to recover numerous claims, amounting to over 100,000 Tumans, against these Arab marauders.

Bandar Ahbas-Eudhar-Jiruft to Bam and Kerman.— route is also greatly used by the local carriers especially during the winter and spring months. Throughout the year, very few robberies have taken place on this route owing to the good arrangements made by Zargham-us-Saltaneh through Rudbar, and also owing to the presence of a strong Detachment of South Persia Rifles at Bam which has kept in check the Baluch robber bands who formerly used to infest this route, greatly to the detriment of trade. [a) Kerman to Yezd via Bahramabad, —Trade along this route has been greatly harassed by Parsi robber bands consisting of Chahar Rahis, Tutakis, Labu Mohammedis, etc, helped by the Shahr .Babakis. It is hoped that a temporary check has been given to these robber bands by the operations carried out by South Persia Rifles in October (for details see under South Persia Rifles)^ Trade is also greatly hampered by the excessive illegal Rahdari fees levied by the Qarasuran Department and in some places by the local chiefs.FOR THE YEAR 29 Lieutenant-Colonel G. L. Earran, D.S.O., M.C., was in command of the Kerman Brigade till February. He was then succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel M. H. Lucas, D.S.O. In November, Lieu tenant-Colonel Lucas was appointed temporarily Inspector-General of South Persia Rifles. In his absence Major 0. C. Crick, I. A., officiates. In April, Colonel Orton, Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, accom panied by Major Gardener and Barr, paid a visit to Kerman. Service in the South Persia Hiflcs is growing in popularity amongst the local notables, etc. The following are now Persian officers in the Brigade :— Saijid Mohamed Khan, son of Deputy Governor of Sirjan. Mehdi Khan, brother of the Afsbar Ilkhaoi. Ali AVbar Khan, nephew of Sardar Mujallal.

Owing to the approach of the hot weather, work bad then to be stopped. The settlement of the case of the murder of the late Ressaidar Ahmad Yar Khan was mainly due to the efforts of Major Crick and Captain Coffey loyally assisted by Sardar Mujallal. A strong detachment of South Persia Rifles under Lieutenant-Colonel Lucas, D.S.O., left Kerman in May for Ispahan. This column was away from Headquarters for nearly three months. The result of South Persia Rities activity led to the capture of Reza Jeozani and Jaffer Quli, the famous robber brigands of the Ispahan Province. In August, owing to the activity of Arab robbers on the Daulatabad-Baffc road, a small column under Captain Coffey was sent out. This column was soon able to clear the road of these robber bands and to allow trade to pass with safety. The column returned to Kerman in October and since then no raids of any importance have occurred. In October, a column under Lieutenant-Colonel Lucas, P.S.O., left Head quarters for Shahr Babak with the intention of capturing Kajaf Quli .Khan and other well-known Shahr Babakis who were in the habit of assisting the Parsi robbers in their raids on the Yezd and Meshed routes. By a forced march of over 60 miles Lieutenant-Colonel Lucas succeeded in surprising and capturing Najaf Quli Khan and Ghulam Ali Khan, a very creditable perfor mance. His Majesty's Consul was anxious that these operations should have been extended to Hirat-i-Khureh, Mazinjan, etc., but owing to political unrest in Pars Province the occasion was not considered a suitable one. On the return of this column. His Majesty's Consul proposed to His Majesty's Minister that the Shabr Babak district should, if not permanently, be tem porarily placed under the Governor-General of Kerman so that effective steps might be taken to stop these robber bands constantly harassing trade with Yezd and Meshed. Unfortunately the Persian Government was unable to accede to this request. In October, one squadron of Cavalry under Captain Cochrane proceeded to Gakum to protect the Military road from Bandar Abbas to Saidabad and will remain there for the winter. Owing to the closure of other routes in Persia, especially during the early part of the year, Kerman trade flourished. rl,rade • Unfortunately, on the other hand, trade was hampered by the heavy cost of transport which varied during the yeai from 90 Tumans to 80 Tumans per Kharwar and later on by the great irregu larity of exchange. The Kran exchange has varied from 180 to oOO pei 100 rupees and the sterling rate from 28 Krans to 22^ Krans.

Khalifah Khair Milhammad.^—ln. the beginning of the year rumours were rife that the Khalifah was dead but unfortunately they proved false. He was most active in inciting the truculent people of the country to damage the telegraph line He is a fanatical Anglo-phobe and until he is removed from his present residence, either by the British or Persian Governments, the tele graph line will not be immune from damage. He has considerable influence over the people of Karwan and Jousadar, On the occasion of the murder of Azim Khan by our sepoys, he tried his utmost to persuade Shahdullah to avenge himself by attacking Charbar. The latter, however, wisely refrained from following the ill advice. When last heard of, Khair Muhammad was at Moganshaboo. Piri Dervish, a notorious slave trafficker and bandit, was reported in March to have been killed,by his own followers. The Assistant Superintendent, Jask Sub-Division, left on 9th December 1919 on his inspection of the telegraph line between Jask and Gwadur with a military column. He had not inspected the line since the outbreak of war on account of disorder and unrest in the country. When the column was passing the Karwan district, a Baluch named Hoti Brahim threatened to kill camel drivers who were cutting grass. A party sent to arrest him was fired on at point blank range by his son. The father also fired several shots. Finally both were shot dead and their arms seized.

The detachment of l-3rd Brahmins Mas relieved by a detachment of 2-lst Military Detachment. Brahmins in February. The average monthly strength was 94 non-commission ed officers and men and two British officers exclusive of half mule section. Only three sails, two anchors and two bundles of cargo of the dhow Wiecks 'Muafiq' (reported in last yearns Adminis tration report) were seat to Jask by Mir Mustafa Khan, the remainder:—300 bags of rice, 100 bags of wheat and 400 bags of charcoal, w T ere looted by Noor Mohamed, brother of the above chief. In January, the country craft 'Badami' belonging to Seth Utoomal of Charbar left Bunder Abbas for Charbar with a general cargo and encounter ing bad weather put in at Girav North of Sirik and came to Charbar later on. The Nakhuda lodged a complaint in the office of the Assistant Superintendent Telegraph Station at Charbar to the effect that he anchored in 18 fathoms and on going ashore to get assistance to bale out the water, he was detained by the headman of the place and forced to sign a bond for Es. 6,0 )0 for salvage by Mir Burkat who had come on the scene m the meantime. He added that goods worth Rs. 1,254 were taken away by the chief. Mir Burkat contended that the boat was leaking and that as the Nakhuda and crew had intended to abandon her, he gave assistance by supplying men who baled out the water and Tepaired the craft. He admitted having taken the goods and claimed the balance. The ow^ner paid Es. 3,000 to the chief by the decision of the Deputy Political Eesident. In April, dinghy Vithalpassa' bound for Karachi from Basrah cast anchor near Sharno, 14 miles East of Jask, on account of adverse currents. She was boarded by the followers of Chiragh Khan, son of Mir Mustafa Khan, who removed 1,401 bags of Jowari and practically all the belongings of the crew. The anchor rope was deliberately cut and the boat left to drift and break up. The Nakhuda and crew who went to Jask were provided with passages to Karachi. After a great deal of correspondence, only 233 bags of Jowari and a few sundries were returned by Mir Mustafa Khan. Eepeated endoavours to recover the remaining goods, have proved futile. At the instance of the Deputy Political Eesident, orders were issued by the General Officer Commanding, Bushire Eorce, to the Officer Commanding Jask Troops, to apprehend Chiragh at the first opportunity. In December, dinghy ' Haidri' of Bhavnagar with dates from Basrah ran ashore near Sirik. Mir Burkat's followers unloaded the cargo. The chief claimed half of the cargo and half of the value of the boat. She was ultimate ly brought to Jask undamaged and delivered to her Nakhuda. The chief was allowed to retain the dates in return for his services. In. the same month, dinghy Sultani ' of Gwadur ran ashore near Gabreg and became a to^al wreck. The Nakhuda and crew saved themselves. The major portion of the cargo was jettisoned and the remainder was reported to have been carried away by one Noor Mohamed and others. His Majesty's Ships 'Bramble,' ' Britomart' and &lt;f Nearchus' occasion- Na ^ ally visited the port during the year. The Deputy Political Eesident, 5 Persian Gulf, visited the station in March and December.

On the 6th April, six sepoys of the water fatigue party were shot by Baluchi's at the well near the telemnh Shootmg cases. garden, three died on the spot' one subsequently and two were severely wounded. The supposed murderers were Azim Khan and Said Mohamed, brothers oi Bahram Rind of Shirbaz, who had left their home for the sole purpose of kiljing some British European officers in order to avenge the death of their brothers at Mand where Mr. Hughes and Lieutenant Horst had fallen victims at the hands of those rebels Reports of their movements were occasionally received, the last being that they were seen at Tezkopan near Charhar about 13th March. It seems not a little singular that t.lGir entry into the village was unknown and only noted after the murders had been perpetrated. A sortie was made by the Walis men to capture the culprits. The party got within range of the offenders, but, alter merely firing a few shots, returned to Charbar. The subsidised chiefs were called upon to arrest the perpetrators of the outrage and, in order to stimulate them, a reward of Rs, 2,SCO was promised. Though Mir Din Mohamed appeared to show an ardent desire to capture the murderers, he actually did nothing. On the 13th June, whilst Azim Khan and Fateh Khan, relations of Shahdullah of Bir, were leaving Charbar on a Government mission to recover some property looted by MirSaidi of Shighim, from a British Indian subject, they were shot detid by the sepoys of the detachment in the vicinity of the same well where their comrades had fallen some months before. 'this unfortunate incident caused considerable perturbation amongst the turbulent people of Bir who were kept under control by Shahdullah. The latter was informed that the matter would be thoroughly investigated, but would be materially influenced by his conduct in the interval. In anticipation of any trouble arising through this deplorable accident, both Charbar and Jask were reinforced by the General Officer Commaiidim?, Bushire force. On the 18th November, a relation of the wazir of Mir Mahmud Khan of JJasiityari, whilst on his way home, was shot dead by our sepoys near the same well. Ine deceased wore a bandolier containing 39 Mauser cartridges but was no :■ Car rying a rifle. Ihe two cases were personally investigated by Colonel Trevor at Charbar m the middle of December and report forward to the Gov ernment of India. r In January, a Bahrain country craft with cargo valued at about Es. 7,335 Wrecks. ran ashore near Tank. Some of the cargo vr Q vu„j„ , ^ was salved and finally sold by the ^akhuda at Chai^bar. Every assistance was rendered by the Assistant Super- wtendent of the Telegraph Station to the Nakhuda and his crew. *, j I ,V ,,e of February, dinghi 'Shikari' owned by Haji u usam o Charbar, route to Charbar from Muscat, was driven ashorefoe the year 1919, 37 at Tank by a heavy gale. The Nakhuda, crew (except one wlio was left on board in the confusion) and seven passengers, abandoned the vessel and rowed off in a small boat taking with them all available cash. The boat capsized and the whole party was drowned. Shadullah and his followers, about 100 in number, took possession of the vessel and refused to release it until Rs. 10,000 and the entire cargo were given to them. As the Biris had removed the whole cargo and threatened to destroy the vessel, H. M. S. ' Britomart ' appeared on the scene and towed the dinghi to Charbar in perfect condition. The majority of the cargo was eventually recovered through the assistance of Husain Khan and delivered to the owner's agent at Charbar. In July, dinghi ' Khalfati belonging to a Karachi merchant, sailing from Calicut to Muscat, was driven ashore at Khunraak by a heavy gale. The Nakhuda and crew abandoned the vessel, which became a total wreck. Navy. The following ships of the Royal Navy called at Charbar during the year. H. M. S. ' Bramble ' and ' Britomart.' A French Aviator, Mons. Poulet, landed at Charbar on 9th November and . , left the following day.

Munshi Abdur Rahim retired on 31st July after serving 36 years He was succeeded by Lai Khan, former Naib of Panjgur, who draws pay R100 per mensem plus dollar exchange compensation which amounts to R80 per mensem, sanctioned by the Hon'hle the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. The title of the British representative has been changed from ' Native Assistant ' to ' British Agent.' The establishment has also been increased from two to three persons. Saif bin Badar continued to be Wali up to the middle of November 1919, when he left for Muscat on leave He Wah ' was relieved by Mulla Mohamed bin Hamad, Wali of Peshkan. The former displayed unnecessary activity in land questions, interferring [with British Indian subjects in the construction of their houses, on the plea that the land belonged to the Sultan. There were two such cases during the year under report, one of which, after long correspondence with his Britannic Majesty's Consul at Mascat, was decided by the Sultan in favour of the British Indian subject. The other is still under enquiry. The Sultan's customs are still managed Cu8tom8 ' by Seth Mohammed Rahtnoo Mowji, a Khoja. All disputes, whether monetary or criminal, arising among the British Indian subjects, were settled on the spot, Judlclftl ' or by correspondence with the Director at Karachi. There were very few cases in which British Indian subjects on one side, and the Sultan's subjects on the other, were involved. Six slaves took refuge at Gwadur during the year. All were sent to Karachi at Government expense. A desti- slavei • tute girl (British Indian subject) was also sent to Karachi and from thence to her home at Aurangabad, at Govern ment expense. In January, the Nakhuda of dinghy Dowlatpassa ' carrying 900 bags of rice to Bahrain, sold a part of the cargo sale of cargo. ^ Peshkan (territory of Sultan of Muscat), Ganaz and Jewni (territory of Khan of Kalat) and scuttled the vessel, which was insured, at Rashidi. The accused hails from Lus-Bela State.

B iyaba.n D istrict. Mir Burkat has been Kalantur of this district throughout the year. A considerable amount of ill-feeling still exists between the Tahirzais and the Mirs of Biyaban owing to blood feuds. Mir Burkat stated the former were quite willing to have the matter referred to Shariat, but that it was necessary that some high official should be present to enforce the decision. This does not seem to have been arranged for, as settlement has not yet been arrived at. About four months ago, a large number of slaves came in from Bashkard and took refuge within the Jask piquet line; they complained bitterly of brutal treatment by their masters Gul Mohamed and others. In November two out of a party of them (who had gone out to obtain foodstuffs), were murdered in cold blood whilst asleep at Ushdan After this, some of them Volun tarily returned to their masters, the others being sent away from Jask to be manumitted. Although Mir Burkat had offered to look after them, and, if possible, to arrange matters amicably no reason was seen why this should be done. At about the same timp, report was received that some of Mirza Khan's men had come into Sarnai and looted cattle belonging to one Abdul flusain of Marz. In affray which took place, when latter attempted to recover the animals, two notables of Rudbar named Haji Murad and Husain Ali are said to have been killed. It was further reported that Mirza Khan intended coming to Bashkard to seek revenge. Mir Burkat on hearing this is reported to have collected a force and asked the chiefs of Jask district to accompany him to try and effect a settlement with Mirza Khan, or to protect and assist Abdul Husain. This was put forward by Mir Burkat as an excuse for not being able to meet the Deputy Political Resident w r ho wished to see him on urgent business at Jask. Gul Mohamed of Bashkard (owner of slaves mentioned previously) was reported to have threatened to damage our lines and ill-treat lineguards, if slaves were not returned, but did not carry out his threats. Nothing else of importance has occurred in this district during the year. Jask District. The district continues to be administered by Mir Mustafa Khan, who iiowe^ er, has little or no influence, his brother and sons doing just as they please, even to the extent of committing hostile acts towards us, such as looting of dhows when driven ashore in bad weather. They openly defy even Mir Burkat by looting his subjects when opportunity offers, relying on Mustafa Khan to dissuade Mir Burkat from punishing them for such offences. Mir Hoti of Jask has very little influence in the district, gives us no trouble, and does his best to look to our interests in the place.for the tear 1919. 39 G aih D istrict. The Sirdar of this district is Husain Khan. He is still very vonn- and and unable to look after his own interests, Mahmud Khan of Fanobeh was his guardian till August 1919, during which time he looked only to his own interests, and tilled his pockets with revenue collected on behalf of Husain Khan, as also got possession of as many rifles and as much ammunition as he could coax out of Husain Khan. Since August, Husain Khan has been trvino- to manage the district himself, but gets very little of the revtnue as he is easily led and fleeced by those around him. Mir Din Mohamed of Dashtyari has been doing nis best to get a share in the governing of Gaih district, and ■wished to marry Husain Khan's sister-in-law, but permission was not eiven Husain Khan foreseeing that this might lead to Din Mohamed getting sway' There were several rumours that the neighbouring chiefs intended^drivin^ Husain Khan out of Gaih but the omy roan who actually took action was Rustam Khan of Champ, who raided Gaih taking away a fair amount of loot and some prisoners.

This district was under the joint administration of Yahya Khan and his uncle Nagdi Khan, until the end of October 1119 when, during the absence of the latter, the former captured his fort, and retained possession for nearly two months. Mir Din Mohamed of Dasht^/ari, who was in Bint during the time, is said to have supported Yahya Khan. The people of Karwan and Joushder, who are considered subjects of the chief of Bint, do not however acknowledge', him as such; they have been interfering with and damaging our lines periodi cally (at the instigation of Khalifah Khair Mohamed, who is always inciting them against the British and who resides in a small village near Panocch), and the chiefs of Bint have done nothing to punish them. The culprits in Karwan are said to be relations of the men executed for the murder of Mr. Graves about twenty years ago and to have left the Karwan district, throwing in their lot with Khalifah. The Joushder culprits are said to reside in the villages of Joushder, Toladar and Gunz. D ashttari D istrict. Mirs Mahmud Khan and Din Mohamed are the joint chiefs of this district. A considerable amount of ill-feeling exists between them, but to all appearances they are friendly. B ahu D istrict. Mirs Subhan Khan and Ahmed Khan ruled this district throughout the year. There is seldom, if any, trouble in this district; the chiefs being very quiet and treating their subjects with kindness. G eneral. Eainfall, although late, was plentiful and the coming harvest is expected to be a better one than the last. There had been a considerable number of deaths due to influenza but the epidemic has been, very light as compared with last year. The anti-British feeling, which existed throughout the country during and up to the end of the year 1918, is gradually subsiding and, except for the people who continue to stand by the Khalifah Khair Mohamed, the country as a whole has come to realise that we have proved victorious in the Great War and has greater respect for us. Our relations with all chiefs have been and continue to be friendly.40 ? ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY CHAPTER VI.

His Excellency Sheikh Sir Khazal Khan visited Koweit during the year and spent the summer months at Ahwaz. In January the Karguzar, acting on instructions from the Foreign Priromai Minister, proceeded to Ahwaz with Haji P„.0,pal events. Eais-ut-Tujjar with the object Of getting a, commission started to estimate damages done by the Turks in 1915,POR THE TEAR 1919. 41 when they came to Ahwaz via Beni Turuf and Amara. The report was sent by the Karguzar to the Foreign Ministry. la February Sheikh Abdul Karim Khan, son of His Excellency Sheikh Sir Khazal Khan, G C.I.E., was married to the daughter of Ahmad Chalabi of Abul Khassib, and Mohammed Agba, son of Haji Eais ut-Tujjar, O-I.E.,* £•/ was married to the daughter of the late Miiza Hamza. His Excellency the Sheikh invited a party of British Military officers from Basrah to lunch in honour of the occasion. Among those present were : the Inspector-General of pommunications, Military Governor, Senior Judicial Officer, Commissioner of Police, etc. The Civil European Residents of Mohammerah, together with the officers of the Indiin Convalescent Dep6t } were invited to dinner the following night, Teace Treaty. —The signing of the Peace Treaty between the Allies and Germany was received in Mohammerah with general satisfaction, which was accentuated by the fact that the day coincided with the Id-ul-Fitr. Peace celebrations were held by His Britannic Majesty's Consul, and arrangements were made for the firing of a salute of 101 guns by His Excellency the Sheikh's battery. The British Consulate was decorated with flags during the day and illuminated in the evening The news of the signing cf the Anglo-Persian agreement was received by telegram on 10th August 1919, and waa immediately circulated to the Local Officials and British Firms and was made known to the local inhabitants. Every one seemed pleased at the agreement and the trend of public opinion was entirely favourable. A telegram of congratulation was despatched to the Prime Minister, Teheran. Moghis-ud-Dowleh, formerly an assistant of Nezam-es Sultanah, who has I been residing at Mohammerah with His Excellency the Sheikh for the past 7 years, left Mohammerah for S iiraz at the beginning of November on a visit to His Highness Prince Farman Farma, Governor-General of Fars. He was the bearer of several presents from His Excellency the Sheikh. Polling for the election of a member of Parliament to represent Moham merah at Tehran took place in August and was carried out under the supervi sion oi ; the Karguzar. Shukrullah Khau, Qawam-ud-Dowleh, was elected »by a majority of votes. An unfortunate incident was the sudden illness of Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar, C.I.E,, w r ho Avas struck down with a partial paralysis of the left side of his body, w T ith partial loss of feeling and distoralion of sensation on the right side. The diagnosis w r a8 Arterio-Sclerosis (thickening and hardening of the arteries) due to old age and that the present attack was due either to vascular disturbance in the brain or very slight haemorrhage (stroke of paralysis). While the condition may ameliorate, it is unlikely he will make a complete re covery, and it is probable that he wi'l have a more severe attack later on. As a result of this, he left Mohammerah in August for Baghdad, where he has been residing. His absence is greatly felt by His Excellency the Sheikh. Information was received that a Persian, named Azizullah, formerly a Vakil Bashi in the South Persia Rifles at Shiraz, who had assasinated a British officer and British Non-Commissioned officer near Shiraz, w;as in Mohammerah, in the disguise of a religious mendicant. His Britannic Majesty s Consul at Shiraz was immediitely communicated with, and, on receipt of his reply that the man was badly wanted, Azzizullah was arrested and sent under escort to Bushire for onward despatch to Shiraz. . Sheikh Mohammed Jawad Jezayeri, who was deported from ^ ajaf and Mas residino* at Mohammerah with His Excellency the Sheikh, was permitted to return to Najaf in August, by order of the Civil Oommissionei iu Mesopo tamia. Agha Abdi Es Semoor, the former Deputy Governor of Mohammerah and tax collector of the town, was reappointed tax collector for the year, as he had increased the amount payable as taxes to the Sheikh by about x/I 50( on t&gt; at paid by his predecessor. ,42 ANKUAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY. Local Police. —Sheik Chassib Khan, Nusrat-ul-Mulk, Deputy Governor of Mohammerah, took up the question of policing the town, and in April called for volunteers to enlist in the Force. Two of his trustworthy Arab servants were appointed Inspectors. The idea was to have a police force and station in the town. There has been a steady development, and the number now totals about 150. These men are being instructed in drill and discipline bv one Izzaf Effer.di (Turkish subject and resident of Basrah), who has been eiven the rank of Captain by the Sheikh and whose designation is Commif- sioner of Police, Mohammerah. Since the formation of the police force robberies, etc., in the town have been reduced to a minimum. Adliyeh.—ln December Sheikh Chassib Khan, Nusrat-ul-Mulk, Deputy Governor of Mohammerah, notified this Consulate officially that he had insti tuted a Judicial Court for the purpose of enquiring into police questions, under his own supervision. The Court is comprised of 8 members, 4 represent ing the town, 1 the Arab tribes, 1 Modei-el-Umum, 1 Mustantiq and the Sheikh himself. The ^uard consisting of one non-commissioned officer, and six sepoys, which was provided by the Military Consular escort. Authorities at Basrah, was withdrawn in June with the approval of the Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia. Two local Persians have now been engaged, and act as guards during the day. The night guard is furnished by the Sheikh's Ghulams. This department worked under Monsieur Andreiux as Director through out tbe year. Several confiscations were Cut,tom9 made during the year, the most important being a consignment of opium worth £T 750, which was being smuggled by some Chinaman crew of a merchant ship. A petition signed by practically ail the leading merchants of Mohammerah, complaining against the general working of the Customs and its employees, was submitted to the Deputy Governor. ^ Two of the Customs employees, one an Italian subject, were also reported to Teheran by the Director for alleged misappropriation of Customs money. One, a man named Paul (an Armenian of Isfahan), who was at one time a Director of Customs at Shushtar, was dismissed, but the cases against the other two have not been proved. Worked satisfactorily during the year. The new offices are now occupied. A telephone line has also been laid to Pcet and Telegraphs. Basrah by the Telegraph Department. This, however, has been hired solely to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limi ted, for their private use. The other British firms have protested against this, the contention being that facilities should also be extended to other Britisu firms, and that it is detrimental to British Trade and British firms that any single firm should have the monopoly of the line. Anglo-Fersian Oil Company Limited. —The Company's operations in the , past year include a very heavy programme Bnlisn interestb. 1 p , ■ i A, rvf of extension work, the completion 01 which will probably double the marketable products at the present time available. The through-put capacity of the present pipe lines is being increased oy means of additional pumping stations, the erection of which are being rapidly proceeded with at Mulla sani, Kut Abdullah and Doru -u-Qwain, early in the new year, and alone will increase the crude through-put by approximately one- third of the quantity at present available. A new ten-inch pipe line is also in course of construction from ^'ais to th&amp; Oil Fields at Maidi-i-Naftun. At the Company's Refinery at Abadan large extension work is in progress. An additional site has been secured at Barwarda, some miles below Aha an, where wharfage is being erected together with tankage adequate for the storag prior to export of the more dangerous petroleum products, at a safe qist&amp;nc, from the main Works,FOK THE YEAR 19i9 ' 43 The Standard Oil Company of New York are probably bent on competing with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited. In October one of their gteamers, S. S. ' Aspinet', arrived with a cargo of 57,000 cases Kerosene oil for Mohammerah. This is the first shipment from America since the outbreak of the War. It is believed that she discharged Kerosene Oil at other Gulf ports. Messrs. Grey Mackenzie and Company, Limited, and Messrs. Lynch Brothers, Limited, amalgamated under the title of ' Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, Limited.' The Mesopotamia-Persia Corporation, Limited, made a demand for reason able facilities for landing through cargo to Ahwaz in bond until such time as up-river charges were available. The Director of Customs objected to this, on the ground that Corporation did not possess suitable bonded premises. A settlement was finally arrived at whereby this is to be permitted on the condi tion that the Corporation will be held responsible for payment of duty on any package which may be short-landed at Ahwaz-this applies to packages receipted for to ocean steamers and not those short-landed by, ors hort received fion , steamers. The Imperial Bank of Persia carried on its work during the year. The Indian Convalescent Dep6fc continued till April when it was trans- ^ , n ferred to Basrah. Most of the material Miatary Convalescent Depot. htm - j i ^ j .t_ was removed by the Military, but the buildings and huts were sold by public auction by the Government Auctioneer of Basrah. Three of the buildings were given to Haji Eais-ut Tujjar, C.I.E., as compensation for any loss he might have incurred in deterioration of date crops. The majority of the huts were purchased by Messrs. The Anglo- Persian Oil Company, who removed them to Abadan, and erected one near the Company's offices atiMohammerah, as quarters for their Indian clerks. Haji Eais's buildings are still standing on the site, and have now been leased by the Officer Commanding River Surveys Port Directorate, to be used as a Tidal Observation Camp at Mohammerah. - Assistant Surgeon C. 33. Lincoln, Quarantine and health. M.B.E., held the post of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. The Charitable dispensary in the town continued to be ^vell attended. A few cases of plague occurred during the months June to August, (Sd.) C. H.

Atta Mohammed continued to be attached to the Civil Hospital during the year. The escort of the 31th Poona Horse attached to this Vice-Consulate were relieved on the 25th July 1919 by an escort of the 26th Cavalry. The former escort had been in Persia just under six years on account of the difficulty of relieving them during the war. I am of the opinion however, that escorts should on no account be permitted to serve for more than three years, if pos sible this period being reduced to two, as lengthy absence from their regiments is more than likely to have an adverse affect on their chances of promotions, etc., when they return. ihe beginning of the year 1919 found the situation extraordinarily tran- Political. qui). Owing to the support afforded by „ ,, , . our troops stationed in Ahwaz, Shusb, ancliquir, Derakhazineh and the Oilfields to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, t ^etts, attacks on the caravans, and lawlessness generally, had become a thing of the past. 0 J The months of January, Eebruary and March were completely uneventful. ^ Were ^ ssue ^ ^ withdrawal of troops at Shush, the i elds, Derakhazineh, and Bandiquir. The effect of this was at once appar- Vi ' a urires t seemed to sweep through the whole country, caravans in waz refused to proceed to Dizful and Shushtar and vice versa, and it was ^enei a y understood that we were about to withdraw our support and that the regime of law and order would shortly end. 0n f^ ese 01 ^ ers m0( ^ e( ^ oxtent that it was decided To i 6 retain garrisons in Shush and Ahwaz, the pendulum swung back, and an airs resumed their normal course, ^ A \ as cons idered that the Sheikh of Mohammerah was now capaoie oi resuming control of tlm hrihpo nf at^^i m.aaKFOR THE TEAR 1919. They vere accordingly handed over, and all subsidies formerly paid to them fcr tlieir good behaviour, withdrawn. From the beginning of June up to date, the only event of importance has been the publication of the terms of the Angel-Persian Agreement. Tt caused no particular stir as the moral and political atmosphere, the creation of which was apparently one of the aims of the agreement, has been in actual existence for some time past. The agreement, however, was received very favourably as being a cate gorical expression of the good-will of the British Government and a guarantee of its continued interest and protection, the value of which is 'nowhere more highly appreciated than in this province, especially by the masses and the mercantile community. The Sheikh of Mohammerab, although genuinely welcoming the agreement, at the same time realises that there are certain personal disvantages accruing therefrom, the principal being that the considerable revenue demand upon him by the Persian Government will receive substantial backing by our own. Occasional departure from the path of righteousness have met with prompt punishment from the Sheikh of Mohammerah, through his son Sheikh Abdul Hamid Khan, the Deputy Governor of Ahwaz. The importance of our Military backing, however, must not be lost sight of, the tribes submit to punishment and to the enforcement of law and order, merely because they are afraid of the force which they know lies behind the Sheikh of Mohammerah, contact with which they are most anxious to avoid, and although in no case has military pressure been brought to bear on them, the moral effect of its presence is sufficient. Pending developments expected as the outcome of the Angle-Persian Agreement, no scheme has as yet been put forward to replace this force, w 7 hen it is eventually withdrawn. Some such force whether composed of tribal levies, gendarmarie, or orga nised by the Sheikh of Mohammerah on the line of the Indian Imperial Service troops, is an absolute necessity if the former state of cnaos is not to be reverted to. The Civil Hospital which has grown from a mere Vice-Consulate Chari table Dispensary, now contains 30 beds with a separate vemieal Oiancn. A table of attendance in comparison with 1918 is attached (appendix 1). Except for the pay of the Civil'Surgeon, and a Sub-Assistant Surgeon, it is self-supporting and it is hopod to arrange for its activities to ex.en 0 Dizful and Shushtar in the future. The cost of drugs, howtver, a ar D o 1 em of expenditure, which has up till quite lately been borne bj . e ^ j at l will no doubt seriously hamper the work of the hospital it fui lei oca . uppu is not forthcoming.

The appreciation of the rupee and re-opening of the other trade routes into Persia, closed during the War, has naturally affected the trade here. The boom which was so Evident at the end of 1918 has ceased, and the colsequent reaction has set in. ^ Business isho reverby no means at a standstill, and will no doubt become steadier later on : the half yearly turn over of the Ahwaz branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia being Krans 1,700,000 as compared with Krans 1,185,000 in 1918. The firm of Lynch Brothers who, in May combining with Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company, Gray Paul and Company and Stephen Lynch and Company, formed the Mesopatamia-Persia Corporation, Limited, show a decrease of nearly 50 per cent in their forwardings up the Lynch Road as compared with 1918, a table of which is attached (appendix II). They have, however, shown considerable activity in the district. Since the cessation of hostilities they have been able to place two ships on the Lower Karun and one on the Upper Karun. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have made considerable progress during the year under report. 8 new wells have been sunk where oil has been struck. 3 new subsidiary pumping stations have been put in course of construc tion which will considerably increase the output of Oil to the refinery at Abadan. Another 10'' Pipe Line has been put in hand replacing the present 6* Pipe Line from Tembi to Wais. Bridges and roads have/and are being made which will render their communications to the Oilfielxls a matter of ease in all weathers. The present average output of oil per diem from the Pi o ld is;— 1,0(10,000 gallons day in cotnparis 'U with 700,000 gallons day in 1918, The end of the War has also rendered their labour, both European and Indian, easier to obtain, but owing apparently to continued Government requirements, the company is suffering from a shortage of river transport which considerably hampers their operations. A most successful agreement with the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh has just been concluded by His Maj/st/y's Vice-Consuls at Kermanshah, Ahwaz (Captain E. G. B. Peel) and a Company's representative, with regard to the Company extending their operations into that province. A surveying engieer has returned from an extended tour of the communications, to the district where work will he commenced and his reports are most satisfying. Revenue. —The revenue which is assessed and collected in money and kind by the Sheikh of Mohammerah is taken by him, and he is then responsible for a fixed payment ot the Persian Government.

Ure T 0f f I ? otorious Sang of brigands headed by Lynch Road, on the IMh JuTe ' Wh0 113(1 f0r the past year illfosted tbe A 2 ' Th f formation of a commission for internal Bakhtiari affairs, on the 6th August. 1 G 3. The resignation of the Illkhaai, Sirdar Zaffar and the Illbegi, Srdar Ashjaa, on the 23rd, October. &amp; , The first which v a^ engineered by our influence, and assisted bv our money ^ ms ) am ^ 1 &lt; u ^ 1 t 1 on, following as it did upon the Bakhtiari victory over the Kughilu chiefs m 1918, had the effect of making the Lynch Eoad safe to a degree hitherto not dreamed of. The second was brought about by a sincere desire on the part of the majority of the Khans to arrange some sort of stable Government for Bakhtiari and to avoid the chaos and alterations resultant/on a change of tbe Illkhaniship 7 and Illbegiship which have hitherto taken place. A meeting of the Khans was held in Isfahan where they drew up a ccmpact, which was afterwards revised by His Britannic Maiestry's Vice-Consul at Chighakhor. . Briefly, it consists of a Government composed of the Illkhani and Illbeai wjth two assistants each. . salaries of all six are fixed and the revenues, as much as possible o£ Which were previously used by the Illkhani and Jllbegi for their personal use/ ; will now be placed to the benefit of the country, a 7 The third occurred in October and is due to the unwillingnessi of the present Illkhani and Illbegi to adhere to the new regime. It is expected that the new Illkhani and Illbegi when appointed, will be compelled to carry out the conditions of the commission. In any case they have been shown the way and further interference seems unnecessary until such time as the Persian Government are prepared to deal with them. Economic. —The opening of the other trade routes since the end of ^War has affected Bakhtiari badly. The road is a considerable source of income to the.n both^ ifrom the tolls collected on the bridges and caravansaries. Taese have materially decreased and the anxiety of the Bakhtiari is manifested by the fact that special orders have been issued by the Illkhani to all caravan- raidars against overcharging, petty looting, and other annoyances, which had previously to be overcome by payments. The rate of freight has thus fallen in the last six months from Krans 30 Shahmaund to Krs. 7. The two bridges at Balutak and Shalil are badly in need of paint and overhauling, and I understand that owing to urgent requests the Mesopotamia- Persia Corporation are prepared to carry out this work if certain bad debts are made good, or if the cost is advanced by the IChans, but whether they will be feasible enough to pay for the maintainance of this route through their territory remains to bo seen. Cattle. —Disease has been prevalent amongst the cattle and sheep, speciallv in Chahar Mahal, Crops. —Have been good. Kughilu. Political. —Since the Bakhtiari expedition against the Kughilu in June and July 1918, the Kughilus, except for a very minor squable amoagst themselves, have beer f Iwlutely quiet, and there is nothing of any political importance to reportj.60 annual 5ep0et on the persian gulf political residency. CHAPTER VIII. DIZFTJL AND SHUSHTAR—ADMINISTRATION REPORJ' FOR THE YEAR 1919. Political. (a) Personnel. —Captain Thompson Glover retained charge of the Political Office, Dizful, till February, giving place in that month to Major Napier I.M.S who was succeeded, after a period of one month, by Captain Geard who for three weeks held simultaneous charge of Dizful and Shushtar. Major Meade reported for duty on March 23rd, Captain Geard reverting' to the charge of Shustar On May 23rd, Major Meade assumed additional charge of Shushtar mw Captain Geard transferred. (b) Tet 'sian Officials. —His Excellency Viqar-ul-Mulk, who was re-visitin? Arabistan in a G^fernatorial capacity for the fifth time, found that province no more to his liking than on previous occasions and took the opportunity of the elections to propose himself as a fitting candidate for the Majlis. As regrettably, it was illegal for him to act in a dual capacity as Governor-General and elected member he had, perforce, to resign his post and offer himself for election ^ Dizful, for which constituency he proposed to stand, was in no way anxious to choose him as its representative, but his election was accomplish ed not without recourse to methods that would have brought a blush to the cheeks of all Eatonsville. Fortunately for Viqar an interregnum of some kind was desirable from a Political point of view in order that we mio-ht have a freer hand in bringing about certain reforms in the Revenue Department. He was succeeded as Kafil by Mirza Abdullah Mustaufi, who had hitheito acted as Deputy Governor of Shushtar. Mustaufi's reign has been characteris ed by many abortive attempts to enrich himself at the expense of the Persian Government but his diplomacy is of a childish order and, on the whole he has served our purpose well although I would feel inclined to re^arH 'the success of the Revenue reforms more to his ineffective resistance than to his active assistance. The Deputy Governor for Dizful arrived at the end of April. At a preliminary meeting with him and Viqar-ul-Mulk at Shushtar, it was agreed that he should not be accompanied to Dizful, as was Viqar's original desire, by a new Head of Police and a new Rais of Adliyeh. Contrary to this agreemeot, however, these two officials accompanied Samsal-ul-Mamalik ne ^ Chief of Police attempting to take over control of the D lz tul lohce even before actually entering the town. I represented to Viqar contra ^y t0 0 ur agreement but it was not w'ithout considerable • 1 i.- • Was ln ^ uc . e( i to asree to the appointment of his singularly int lcc ive nominee as Rais of Balediyah. This man, Haji Ghafur by name, a^ been m the past a brothel keeper in Dizful and was also, in his spare une, o onel Commanding the Persian Artillery. His end was tragic as he as s K; m the back by his servant or by the individual who was euphemis tically termed his servant. Samsam 1ms a pleasing personality and has been quite content to sit s ill and watch the work of government going on. He realises that he depends entirely lor the punctual payment of his salary on the Political Office and Bnapes his life accordingly. Our relations have been of the pleasantest. {c) Tribal.—-The year under report has been uneventful. The transfer o cer am tribes to the Sheikh of Mohammerah was accomplished early in May and although minor incidents have marked the absence of direct Political con ro } ie results has been of an ephemeral nature. Sartip Khan, on fn „ m 'Vr ne ' w' e( | the . hono l lr of a -Khan Bahaduri early in the year, continues ® mo ^ 1 je ^ s atisfaction, that is all that can be expected from a Lur ^ les or marriage and cousinship to tribes of Luristan between whomFOR THE TEAR 1919. 51 ■and ourselves he acts as intermediary. The district is peaceful and prosperous, and it is a matter ^ foi satisfaction that it has been unnecessary durin' the year under report to invoke the assistance of the Military. Isolated cases of highway robbery have occurred, but in no instance has the offender escaped eventful retribution. The British Government has been paying in subsidies to K ; ir, f a . m0nth l v mc P- equivalent to approximately £520, but it is anticipated that owing to certain improvements in Revenue collection and disposal, together with the stoppage of some of the more important sources of leakage, the greater part of this burden will shortly be shouldered by the Persian Government. I shall refer further to this subject under the head of 'Revenue Applications, positively embarassing iu number, have been received from the heads of the Qalaqand, i^aharvvand, and JBairanwand tribes to settle in Arabistan. Always provided that these tribes are prepared to forego their nomadic habits, there would be ample room for them along the banks of the Kherkeh, but that is a provision we cannot expect to see fulfilled except by an infinitely gradual process of absorption. They say that there were in far off days, so many towns on the bank of the Kherkeh that a cock could fly from Shush to Ahwaz from roof to roof without setting foot on the ground—but they say so many things. I should like to record here the very great value in dealing with Luristan of the policy of the closed door or what may he termed a double blockade If the gates of Bizful and Khurramabad are definitely shut to the Lur tribes, they must inevitably submit. They are dependent for so many of the minor luxuries that*have, by process of time and a bastard civilisation, come to be reckoned as necessities, on towns. The only towns to which the Lur tribes to which I am referring, havkiW access are Dizful and Khurramabad. The closing of the gates of Dizlul has an instantaneous effect in the winter and spring, an effect that would be rendered doubly marked if the Khurramabad gates were simultaneously closed. The pacification of these tribes and their early submission could, I feel confident, be brought about with a minimum of expense and in the space of a few months by the establishment of a firm government at Khurramabad. Merchants of that town whom I have had the opportunity of meeting, are most insistent in their requests for the appointment of a Political Ollicer at Khurramabad. Indeed, it would be no bad policy for the Assistant Political Officer Dizful to make Khurramabad his summer station. Dizful area is shortly after Nau Hoz entirely freed from the presence of migratory tribes and could, if necessary, be supervised from Ahwaz, a compe tent Head Mirza being of course retained there permanently. This is pre-sup- posing the additional presence at Shush of British Officer-in-Charge of the Levies. Saifullah Khan, one of our subsidised chiefs, was indiscreet enough to fire a revolver at his cousin Ghulam Heza Khan another subsidised chief, and was also indiscreet enough to miss him. This at a tea party. His somewhat naive excuse that he really aimed at some one else proved unavailing, and he was sentenced to two years imprisonment. Folice. —I cannot sufficiently commend the present chief of the Dizful Police, Mirza Hassan. A man of humble beginnings, he has by sterling worth brought himself to the fore. The Police are efficient to a remarkable degree, and it is a pleasure to record that there has been but one case of theft during the year under report, and the thieves were at once arrested and the property recovered. The murderer of Hajo Ghafur was apprehended by Mirza Hassan himself at considerable personal ^isk. The ' Jarchi Milliat however, accuses Mirza Hassan of the actual'crime. The Shushtar Police are efficient but cannot compare with the Dizful force, and were it not for the energy and perseverance displayed by Mirza Ali, the Head Mirza there, their discipline would become lax in a very short time. The Shushtar head of Police lacks the vigour and initiative of Mirza Hassan. Bevenue. —Arabistau has suffered severely in the past from corrupt revenue officials, the corruption starting from the top and working downwards throughout the entire ^taff. Shortly after assuming charge of Dizful, it become very apparent to mo that revenue collections, made entirely by virtue of the presence in th^ place of a Political Officer, were not reaching their correct52 ANNUAL EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GTJLP POLITICAL RESIDENCY^ destination, intact i£ indeed any portion of the sums collected survived the constant demands made by avaricious officials. Surai-ul -Mulk came breathing reform but his stay was short but from his point of view exceedingly sweet. He departed to Bombay with some thirteen thousand rupees wherewith to purchase ledgers, etc., but returned after a presumably eKhilarating stay in India, with a revolving chair and a dozen rubber stamps. He shortly after, on a plea of sickness, departed for Teheran. It was onlv after his departure that I was enabled to turn my serious attention to the question of increasing revenue receipts without increasing the demand, with the ohiect in view of reducing the expenditure of His Majesty s Govern ment in Arahistan. The War was over and the necessity of securing our rieht flank no longer of that paramount importance that made the quasi- occupation of Arahistan a matter of necessity. It is true that I had no autho- ritv to interfere with the revenue arrangements of a neutral country, but it was felt that inasmuch as revenue demands were met entirely by the pressure of the Political Officer, it was unobjectionable for him if, indeed, not incumbent on him to see that receipts reached the rersian Government as intact as possible. I found very considerable leakage under the head of indirect taxation as it did not appear to he politically sound to insist on the dismissal of dishonest personnel, which would have meant the disruption of the whole department, I had recourse to farming. This, too, was a matter of some diffi- oulty as Mustaufl had, with the connivance of Suraj-ul-Mu k taken over through various members of his family, all the more profitable sources of revenue. Slight friction between Mustaufi and another member of the Revenue Department, to whom he had leased the Nawaqil, gave me the opportunity for which I was waiting. The result has been that receipts from indirect taxation have nearly doubled, and I found myself in a position to propose that the Persian Government take over the payment of subsidies to tribes that should actually as well as nominally be controlled by the^ Governor-General 01 Arabis- tan It is calculated that with efficient supervision the results of indirect taxation should be sufficient to meet the larger portion of the Governor- General's Budget. Direct taxation receipts are also excellent, a hint that landlords who did not promptly pay revenue demands would not be entitled to protection against raids being sufficient to guarantee immediate payment. A book of classes paying revenue was compiled in English and Tersian, and revenue under this head shows a most satisfying increase. The lately-arrived Rais of Maliyeh. Muaziz-ul-Mulk, seems energetic and honest and is* really trying to establish order amongst his subordinates I anticipate that the improvement in revenue will mean a saying to His Majesty s Government of approximately £5,000 a year, nor do I anticipate any reduction in Eritish prestige, as subsidies will, as heretofore be paid through the Political Office though the source of payment will be Persian. Trade. —Trade has generally flourished in Dizful and Shushtar, though the variations in exchange have had their effect here as in other places. I was able, through experimenting with a Dizful loom, to introduce to the notice ot the Mesopotamia Corporation a tweed very similar to Scotch and Irish homespun. The Corporation have taken the tweed up commercially and have placed an initial order of 1,200 yards. The principal trade in Dizful and Shushtar is in piece-good, sugar of the loaf and ordinary kind, and tea. Dizful supplies Luristan, and bnusn ar Bakhtiari. The Bizful Bridge Company has declared a half-yearly dividend of 1 per cent, on ordinary shares, British Government shares being paid as preteren shares at 7 per cent. With the proviso that no serious disaster beraiis ^ Bridge, it should prove to be a highly remunerative measure both politic ^ and financially. The Dizful Motor Company, plying between Ahwaz and Shush, and waz and Basrah has a fleet of seven cars, and is making fair progress though a of good drivers rather ten^to increase expenses. . General. —The political tone is eminently satisfactory, and the news of t e new treaty was received with undisguised satisfaction. Relations withFOR TEE YEAR 1919. 63 Priests, Merchants and Notables are very cordial, and there is no shadow of doubt tbat the presence of a Political CHftner is genuinely welcome. When in April, there was some talk of withdrawing Assistant Political Officers from Dizful, and Shush tar the greatest unrest was manifested and when I left Dizful, at the request of the Officer Commanding, Ahwaz Area, to confer with him,' no caravan dared set out from Dizful as there was a general impression that I had left for good. My return and the cancellation of the orders for the removal of troops was the signal for rejoicing, and on my return to Dizful I was given a reception that was positively embiassing. I do not now consider that the withdrawal of troops from Shush woifld have any adverse effect as lone as the Assistant Political Officer is retained. In conclusion, I should like to record my high appreciation of the services of the Head Mirzas in Dizt'ul and Shushtar and of my Indian clerk and accountant. They have served loyally and well. W. L.

Wingate, I.C.S., who held charge till the end of the year. The post of the Agency Surgeon continued vacant. The Senior Medical Officer, Bait-el-Falaj, officiated in charge of the Agency and Telegraph Staff. Mr. Ehtasham-ed -Douleh continued to be Dragoman of the Agency during the year. Sub-Assistant Surgeon J. P. Mascarenhas was relieved on 27th March by Sub-Assistant Surgeon P. P. Desouza who remained in charge of the Hospital till the end of the year. Monsieur Mateudi, the warrant officer in charge French coal godown, , officiated as French Consul till 15th February, when Monsieur C. Lecout^ur ^ relieved him. The latter remained in charge till 27th November, although he proceeded to Bombay on 2nd September returning on 20th October. 'Monsieur J. Yvoonon who relieved Monsieur Mateudi when the la'ter returned to France as warrant officer in charge French Coal Godown on 5th . March, has been officiating since the departure of Monsieur Lec^uteur. y During the year under report there were no collisions between the adherents of the Sultan on the coast and the Omani Condition of country. , • i • iii i.i t party of the interior ruled by the imam, and a state of peace tempered by mutual suspicion and restriction of movement and trade prevailed Jffiarly in the year there was a strong rumour of an intended attack by the Imam on Sur where the Sultan's Government for jears had been singularly futile. H. M. S. 'Britomart' was, therefore, sent down there with the Wali of Muttrah. The affair however came to nothing, though whether this was due to the presence of the ' Britomart ' or to the fact that the supposed attack was a tentative rumour, is not clear. In February, the Political Agent succeeded in getting into touch, by letter, with the Omani Chiefs and a meeting between him and Shekh Isa, the supposed spokesman cf the Imam's party, was arranged to take place in April The death of Seikh Isa's brother, however, caused the date to be postponed, and it was not till the 15th September that the meeting between the Political Agent and Sheik Isa took place at Sib. The situation was discussed with considerable frankness by both side?. The proposal of the Political Agent that the Sultan should be the temporal, and the Imam the spirtual, head of a united Oman was however immediately negatived by the Omani Chiefs. It was realised that a settlement on the basis of the status quo w r as the only possible solution, the Omanis ruling their country and the Sultan his, with freedom of travel and intercourse, and guarantee on the part of both sides against attack. There remained for settlement the question of the return of private propeity of the Sultan's subjects seized by the Omanis, and the return by the Sultan of the Omani prisoners, relatives of Sheikh Isa, whom he held in Muscat. The Sultan was perfectly billing to return the prisoners, and in fact gave the Political Agent a free hand in the whole affair. It is however onlv fair to add that he has been throughout openly sceptical that the Omauis / would come to any agreement except under compulsion. Sjeikh Isa was equal- / ly confident as w T as Shejkh Said bin Nasir-al-Khindi, a prominent AbadluFOR THE XEAR 1919. 66 Mullah resident in the territory of the Sultan, that the Imam would return the gardens when assked to do so. Government sanctioned the Political Agent proceeding on these lines, and it was hoped to conclude an agreement in which Government acted as mediators between the Sultan and the Imam, on the basis of the status quo^ in the form of an exchange of letters between the two parties and the Political Agent. The terms proposed were— On the Sultan's part— (1) freedom of entry for Omanis into Muscat and Muttrah, (2) Reduction of the coastal Zakat on all goods to 5 per cent. (3) Eeturn of Omani fugitives from justice. {4 j ) Kelease of prisoners. ^ ^n the Omanii part— 1 (1) Guarantee of non-interference with the Sultan's Government and of cessation of hostilities with him for the future. (2) Preedom to trade and travel in Omai|i and guarantee of the] safety of travellers. (3) Return of fugitives from the Sultan's justice. (4) Settlement of the claims of traders and others against Omanis, (5) Return of two valuable gardens, private property of the Sultan's sub jects seized by the Imam. To all these terms Sheikh Isa, presumably on behalf of the Imam, had expressed agreement. It however remained to obtain ratification of the promise of Isa by the Imam, and for this purpose Sheikh Said-bin-Nasir-al- Kindi, as had been requested by Sheikh Isa at the conference, was sent by the Political Agent to Nizwa in November to obtain the gardens, when the final settlement would be confirmed on the lines indicated above. It would he Sheikh Said-bin Nasir alone who could hope to overcome the religious prejudice, and the return of the gardens was clearly a most important point, as no peace would be a peace w r hich permitted the confiscation of private property by one side without the smallest shadow of right, and at the arbitrary will of a few religious fanatics. The religious difficulty as had been anticipated proved considerable. Th!^ Mullas, who momentarily have complete power over the Imam, are actually those to whom the produce of the gardens and indifferent to trade advantages peace and politics, at the end of the year they seemed disinclined, after the manner of professional holy men, to listen to the claims of reason or justice when these matters touched their own pockets. Every effort was therefore concentrated on inducing Sheikh Isa to collect his Sheikhs and accompanied by Sheikh Said-bin-Nasir personally to the settle ment on the Imam. This was the situation at the end of the year. (Note.- Though the effect/to induce Shiekh Isa to act and to appear before the Imam were later BUCceBBful, the mullah party proved too strong and the Imam on 18th February 1920, dehmtely refused to return the gardens and la'ify the proposed settlement). Should settlement on these lines be possible an era of comparative pros- peritv should dawn. The coast will develop and the interior may look after itself. But Bedawi the majority of the interior are, and Bedawi they wnl remain. Utterly unreliable and entirely fickle a change in the smiting tribal confederation or in the dominant personalities concerned whose sole interests are their own pockets, will completely aUer the situation and destroy the mos careful calculations. !No agreement will be binding upon f 01 ® simp e reason that thev do not know the meaning of an agreement. I hey understand only/bm? majeurl and if they do not see force majetir/ezch man will be as a h king jfo do as he hies. To-day interior Oman is united to-morrow it may split into a thousand fragments. To strengthen the Sultan s hands to enable him to rule efficiently the coast line, and to stand by himself, and to discourage him from interesting himself in the interior, is a clear policy to pursue. e56 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY Omani fribes may remain as a hinterland—no man can control them—to fight amongst themselves and through fear to refrain more, every year the Sultan's administration improves, from their habitual raid on his territory. At the end of 1918 the Government of India had sanctioned a loan of 5i Hi, HigW Administration. lakIlS of ' 0 , t the S ' lta n the repayment or ms aebts, conditional oa the reform of his administration in certain matters These conditions were the appointment of trained customs officials nominated by us who would rocrganise the customs and introduce a proper financial system into the State, the institution of a proper Court for the administration of justice, the establishment of a good school, and the enrolment and training of a levy corps for his own protection. After some correspondence at the beginning of the year under report between His Highness and the Political Agent, His Highness accepted all the conditions of the loan. Minor modifications were agreed to, namely that the interest on the loan and the first quarterly instalment of principal would not be payable till after a year. His Highness was to fix his own privy purse by agreement with the Political Agent altera month's working of the new system. Grwadur and Dhofar were expressly excluded from the control of the Director of Customs It was not till September of the year that the three Egyptian Customs officials, whose services had been asked for to reorganise the Customs, anired. An arduous task confronted them, as the whole system had to be completely revolutionised if financial order was to be introduced. As has been explained in previous reports, His Highness used the Customs as his bank, borrowing money from merchants on the security of the Customs, the merchants in turn recouping their principal and interest by short payment of iCustoms dues. In other words, for a sum of money down, a skilful Hindu bannia was able to buy the right of free import for ever. It is true that the Customs under Mahomed Heimeo kept theoretical accounts of these transactions, but the appalling abuses of the system need not be dilated upon, , The immediate steps taken were— (1) The appointment of a committee to estimate the debts incurred by His Highness on the security of the Customs, on the basis of immediate payment. (2) The abolition of all short payment of Customs dues. (3) The institution of payment of duty at the current bazaar price in dollars, not at the rupee price converted into dollars at the pre-war rate, which meant a large increase in the rate of duty. (4) The control of all income and expenditure in the Muscat and Muttrah Customs by the Director of Customs. The abolition of short payment of Customs dues naturally roused a storm of protests from merchants complaining that their contracts had been broken. The only remedy was the speedy ranking of the debts by the committee. This was completed by lllh November, and it was found that the debts against the Customs amounted to R4,59,259 while the Sultan had private debts of 111,96,906. This gave a total of 116,56,165 on the basis of immediate payment, and this total was over a lakh less than the amount of the claims. As it was clearly necessary for the Sultan to start with his reformed administration unencumbered, sanction for an additional lakh of loan, giving a total of 6^ lakhs, was asked for and granted. All debts were paid off in cash or by supply bill on Bombay by 31st December. The actual technical administration of the Customs was then taken in hand, and a set of simple rules is being framed and will be published by His Highness and made binding by Political Agent under King's Regulation. The Customs is working well in spite of occasional friction between a too zealous Customs official and a merchant who used to have matters all his own way. The Director of Customs made several tours up and down the coast. Control is almost impossible at the smaller ports but an effort was made toFOR T0E YEAR 1919. 67 establish a Customs house at Sur. In spite of the presence of one of th® Egyptian Customs officials the attempt has been abortive, the Sur people refusing to pay more than the two per cent, they had paid before, and openly defying the SultaA s authority. This is not amunusual situation in Sur, and the only thing that Mill put an end to it is ithe presence of His Majesty Ships which would be a visible sign to the people that we are prepared to support the authority of His Highness on the coast. 1 ^ A rough budget of monthly expenditure was obtained from the new administration and it is given below as an indication both of the financial chaos prevailing and of the remarkable system of Government:— Hough Budget of Monthly Expenditure. Rs. 1. Total of allowances to the members of family and others, cost of fodder for riding animals, household expenses, price of bailey for horses and other expenditure fixed in dollars. $12,531 at 2^0 per cent. . 31^77 2. Total allowances fixed in rupees and fodder for horses . , , 1?,4)1-6 3. Total expenditure for Customs employees fixed in dollars. $ 635 at 250 per cent. ......... 1,587 4. Total salaries fixed in rupees ....... 2,085 6. Presents of Ids and other festivities have not been entered hero and will be entered when occur . , . . • , . Total . 47,694 The first month's working showed receipts Es. 86,918, expenditure Es. 47,312 for the State. On this a monthly alloT^pce of Rs. 10,000 was provisionally fixed for the Saltan's privy purse. Including tills payment the receipt/and expenditure for the next two months were :—- November Keceipts Ks. 78,768, expenditure Rs. 70,071 December „ 61,020, „ „ 67,219 giving a balance of Rs 42,234 a* the end of the year under report. A rough budget compiled from the very small amount of material avail able, estimated receipts of Rs. 10,76,400 and expenditure of Rs. 9,01,280 during the year ending 1st October 1920. On the Ist December 1920 Rs. 65,250 comprising Rs. 39,0C0 a year interest on the loan and Rs. 16,250 first payment of principal is due to Government, Should therefore no specially untoward situation occur, the State should be able to pay its way, though it will not have much money to spend in improve ments. These may wait, however. There is no hurry and with the establish ment of a moderately sound control of income and expenditure, the money necessary for the very slight reforms suitable to this medieval Arab State will eventually appear. His Highness in accordance with his undertaking in May established a regular law court with Saiyid Nadir as judge. The result cannot be said to have been successful. The personal decision of the Sultan, which when he was roused, was fairly speedy, has been replaced by the dilatory attendance of Saiyid Nadir for an hour a day, and the labourious examination of witnesses and writing of unnecessary statements! There are more pending cases than there ever have been before and discontent is growdng. A radical reform of per sonnel and system is required. All that is necessary m Muscat is that justice should be speedy, popular and free. The present system meets none ot these requirements. The administration of the Walis on the coast has continued as before and has in no way sunk from the high water mark of corruption , weakness and incompetence which it had previously reached. No attempt is made by the Sultan to control them and no account is ever demanded of their expendi ture or their stewardship. They but add to the Saltan s unpopularity and weaken his prestige.' 1 58 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY. Ik4 That the provision of personnel is a pressing problem and that trustworthy- personnel is unobtainable from among his own subjects the Sultan well knows, and in consequence he approached the Political Agent with a request for the loan of an officer to act as his Wazir. This proposal was agreed to by Gov ernment and Captain D. V. MicCollum, who had been recently political Agent at Koweit, is on his way out to take up the appointment. A considerable improvement may be expected w^hen this officer arrives. There has been no Arms Traffic. No purchases were made from the _ „ Arms Warehouse. .Arms Iranic. 383 British subjects registered during the year, of whom 99 reside in British subjects and British interests. GrWadur.

The 3rd Brahmans left British troops m Oman. n t t li n -r* i for India on the 14th February. The barracks have been completed and electric light and fans installed in the fort. The Inland Water Transport Officer. —Captain G. Howard Jackson, R.E., Inland Water Transport Officer, Muscat, arrived on 5th March and re-opened the Inland Water Transport Depot in connection with paddle and other steamors which were passing en route to Port Said. He was again transferred to Basrah on 15 th May. Naval. —Engineer Commander G. W. Hollins, E.N., Naval Transport Officer, Muscat, proceeded on leave to Bombay on the 5th June, temporarily handing over duties of the Naval Transport Officer to the Political Agent. Jle however did not return to Muscat and, un.ler orders of the Director, Royal Indian Marine, Bombay, the Naval Transport office was closed in October. Such Naval Transport work as received is being carried on as before the war by the Political Agent. Mr. J. H. Bill, I.C.8., Deputy Political Resident, arrived at Muscat on Visits 11th May and left on the 12Lh May. General A. M. S. Elsmie, O.M.G , commanding at Bushire, arrived on 11th May and left 12th May. Major Bowman with Sheikh Paisal, son of Ibn Saud, and Sheikh Ahmed Thanaiyan Ibn Saud and Sheikh Ahmed Ibn Jabir of Koweit arrived at Muscat on 2nd September. The Sheikhs' party vis-ited His Hiffhness on the 3rd and were entertained by him at lunch, at which the Political Agent, Major Bowman and Captain Bright of the Egyptian army were present. His High ness presented Sheikh Eaisal with tw r o Omani camels and Sheikh Ahmed with one Mr. S. N. Wilson, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, Karachi, arrived on 15th December and left the same day. A few reports of sales of slaves in Oman and the Batineh Coast ports Slave Trade were received. The persons sold were mostly Baluehis. There were 22 petitions for manumission during the year, out of which 13 were manumitted. Three cases have been referred to Shargah for further infor mation and remain pending. In the other cases, certificates were not required. As usual the majority of persons sold were brought over from Mekran. It is hoped that the small remains or' the traffic on the Batineh coast will gradually disappear once the Yal Sadd, the most notorious of the slave dealing tribes, are d\fW. FOE THE YEAR igjg. 59 brought under the Sultan's effective control. The situation is, however complicated by the hostility of the Imam in interior Oman and of the Sheikh of Bireimi. There are demands for slaves in both of these places and once there, the possibility of getting them out or of bringing pressure to bear is small'. The traffic is, however, very small and a certain proportion of slaves manao-e* to escape. 0 Total imports amounted to Es. 43,49,471 and exports Rs. 36,34,842 as Trade. compared to Es 24,99,725 and Es. 2 i,68,978 respectively, of the previous year. It must be remembered that these figures on)y inaccurately/ represent Muscat and Muttrah. Sur has 80 trading dhows which make an average profit of Es, 10,000 per year each, and there are numerous poits on the Batineh Coast each with its colony of Indian merchants and by no means insignificant trade. No record is available of this trade and it must be fully half as much as that of Muscat and Muttrah. The price of dollars continued high, the average prices for the year were as follows :— Rs. January per 100 dollars. February 232 ditto. March 254 ditto. April . , 254 ditto. May . . * . . . 239 ditto. Jure 248 ditto. July ... 250 ditto. August 237 ditto. Septemler , . 256 ditto. October , . . 252 ditto. November , . 254 ditto. December 256 ditto.. On 1st October, His Highness the Sultan issued a proclamation to the effect that from 1st January the rate of exchange would be fixed at Rs. 2 to the dollar. The merchants who have dealings with the interior where only dollars are accepted, were much perturbed. The Sultan, however, when the situation was explained to him soon realised that his proclamation was impossible to enforce and withdrew it on the advice of the Political Agent. The limited amount of dollars in the country, the natural variations in exchange caused by the demand for dollars in the date season or the demand for bills on Bombay to make payment for rice, and the absence of a State bank alike, make arbitrary fixture of the rate of exchange an impossibility. That there are disadvantages in th^ present double currency and in the variations in the rates of exchange are obvious. At the same time, the past war experience of other and more advanced countries havf shown the impossibility of fixing the rates of exchange, and it is doubtful if variations in exchange have such a serious effect on trade as were once supposed. Eupee currency will gradually replace dollar currency with the increase of trade and the opening up of the country. This process may be left to the people them selves, and an immediate attempt at change can only bring disaster. Considerable trouble has been caused in the latter half of the year by the restriction on the export of rice from India. Information as to the sanctioned amount allotted invariably arrived very late and- the amount usua y icadequate. The instance may be quoted when the w^hole of Muscat an Oman, with a population of between half a million and million living almost exclusively on rice, received a quarterly allotment of 250 tons. A condi ion of chronic shortness of supply prevailed, with the result that prices soared and £l/60 ANNUAL EBPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDE^Or euch merchants who maDaged to iinport rice never made less than 100 per cent, profit. Though restriction of export from India was ncavoidable, it is nevertheless a melancholy fact that few if any of our actiors during the war had such a serious effect on our influence in the Gulf. It is reported that Monsieur Ebrahim Elbaz, the only French subject in French Intereetp. Muscat, intends to leave Muscat shortly for good. Monsieur J. Yvonnou, the acting French Consu 1 , has officially informed the Political Agent that the French Coal Depdt at Muscat will be suppressed. M. Yvonnou will wind up the affairs of the dep6t on the arrival of the new French Consui. It is interesting to note that there are now five Omani dhows remaining which are entitled to fly the French flag. One named ' Saham ' has presumably been sold or destroyed and has not been replaced. Doctor (Miss) Hosmen returned to Muscat on 8th October. Revd. G. and American ' Mrs - Van Persuem left May and Misses n Lulten and Kellian in July for India, returning as usual in Autumn. Eevd. G. V. Persuem, Misses Lutton and Kellian left for Basrah in November and returned in December. „ u . The total rainfall during the year maean eat , amounted to 2*67. The highest tempera ture was llO'O. There was no epidemic during the year under report. The Hired Transport ' Charles Tellier ' on her way to Muscat from Aden cwiti aaa tSe a went ashore at Ras-el-Khabba, about ' at Sea. 30 ^ ^ ^ Hj8 Highness the Sultan of Muscat, who happened to be at Sur at the time, on learning this news sent his brother Saiyid Malik with some of his men to Basel Khabba to render any possible assistance to the Master of the ship, H. M, S. ' BriWniart ' was at Muscat and left immediately for Sur The Director, Royal Indian Marine sent a salvage officer and men to assist the transport, but it was found quite impossible to render any assistance to her owing to heavy surf during the monsoon. Subsequently, attempts were made to salve her but without success. The Director, Royal Indian Marine, presumably intends calling for tenders for her sale. S. S, 'St. Michiel' of the Maple Steamship Company of Canada, in French charter arrived here on 7th September. She was bound for Marseilles from Colombo but owing to stress of weather and having ruu short of coal, had to put in this harbour. She was obliged to bum part of her cargo of ground nuts for fuel. Ske left Muscat for Marseilles on 29th September. R. E. L. WINGATE, Political Agent and H. B. M* Si.. Consult Muscai.FOS THE TEAR 1919. 61 CHAPTER X.

It was a test case and an endeavour on the part of Shaikh Isa to assert his authority ® question of removal and nomination of members of the Majhs-al-Ur . o ^ w Isa had been led to believe, by certain interested persons, that he had the right to .dismiss any member of the Majlis-al-Urfi at pleasure, under t e eims o e Order-in-Council which came into force from February 3rd, 1919. Representa tions were at once made to Shaikh Isa, who deputed his son Shaikh Abdu a i to interview the Political Agent regarding the Majlis and his supposed right over it. Shaikh Abdullah was given thoroughly to understand that the Political Agent could not countenance any changes m the functions an composition of the Majlis-al-Urfi without being consulted, this being m accord ance with existing ruling. Shaikh Isa insisted that it was his ng o s the weekly notice calling the Majlis to meet and not the Political Agent s, and that the composition would be the same as agreed on between the Pohtical Agent and himself with the exception of Ahmad Yatim, who had resigned a no g t been dismissed as reported- In point of fact, Ahmad Yatim had been dismissed by Shaikh Isa but had received further instructions to give out that he hTd resLned of his own free will. Ahmad Yatim confessed this to the Political A cent Whilst this vexed question was still being discussed Captain Bray rec^ived orders to proceed ^England with Shaikh Abdullah's mission, and no further progress was made in the mattei. ? m u t ih\ Before leaving Bahrain and unknown the Captain Bray, Shaikh isa instructed his son Shaikh Abdullah to approach : - 1 with four petitions for favourable consideration. y m That the Chief of Bahrain should be placed on an equal line with other neighbouring Arab Rulers and to exercise full junsdic i n over all subjects in his territory. , __ _ ij u (2) That the selection of the members of the Majlis-a - i s on e one of the rights of the Chief of Bahrain. (3) That the port of Zubarah on the Qatar peninsula, as it once belonged to his forefathers, should be made over to him. _ , (4) The privilege of a direct reference to higher authority should be given to the Chief of Bahiain, (c) One of Major Dichson's first acts on ^ r ^ o al ;^® r a Jp^sentatfons take up the question of Majlis-al-Urfl. 1 8ha i k h Isa were made to Shaikh Isa with a Tle ^ „ d ute( i j^is S on Shaikh Abdullah to after much 'beating th 0' jush , (0 , ep a and full discussion took interview the I'olitical Agent on the matter. A trank ana mil62 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY. place which was followed by Shaikh Abdullah raising the four points put forward in London, and asking Tolitical Agent's advice as to the reasons why an answer had not been received. During this convej^aticn, Shaikh Abdullah disclosed the fact that Shaikh Isa was not particularly anxious for an answer, his only anxiety being lest Government were annoyed at his putting forward, petitions which he now knew he should not have done. The interview terminated by Shaik Abdullah accepting the Political Agent's view that the ruling in the Order-ic-Council part I, paragraph 4, should be carried out until a definite ruling came from the Government. (Note. —On 23rd January 1920, Shaikh lea finally consented to the election of half the members of the Majlis-al-UrH by the Political Agent and the other half by himself, on which date Majlis was duly appointed, mem hers selected and work has been carried on since.) (d) The Bahrain Order-in-Council was brought into force from noon of February 3rd, 1919. Shaikh Isa was brought round with difficulty to accept all the terms mentioned therein. {e) As mentioned above, Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa and his son Muhammad proceeded to England on June 6th as the guest of His Majesty's Government. Shaikh Abdullah throughly enjoyed the trip and realised the greatness and ' magnific/ence of the Capital of the British Empire. It is doubiful, however, whether his visit has not done more harm than good. He saw much of an unhealthy and demoralising nature, especially in Paris, and has come back with many wild Political ideas which he had not got before. Shaikh Abdullah returned from England on October 27th. At the suggestion of '• al Malika ' Shaikh Abdullah's mother and only living wife of Shaikh Isa, all the houses and huts of Bahrain were dressed with red and green flags for 6 days in h s honour. III. Victoria Memorial Hospital. —Assistant Surgeon G. K. Monani was in charge throughout the period. The number of cates treated as compared with the two previous years, are as follows :— Ye^r.

The Political Agent's Tours. —On 26th December 1919, the Political Agent, Major Dickson, C.I.E., made an exhaustive tour of the Island with the special view of enquiring into the state of the Islanders and the famine condi tions brought about by the scarcity of rice; Much was learnt as a result of the tour, and the starving condition of the many villagers scattered over the Island was amply verified. Hepresentations w^ere made to the Deputy Political Resident for an increase in the Bahrain allotment for 19-O (rice). It is to be hoped Government of India will see its way to removing the restrictions on the export of rice from India at an early date. ^ One realises Government's mea sures are the result of necessity, but it is difficult to persuade a starving man that Government has other people to think of besides himself. V. Bin Saud : ~{a) During the early and middle part of 1919 relations between Bin Saud and the Shareef Hussain were very strained. Matters came to a head in the vicinity of Khurma and Tarabah, w r hich places were attacked and occupied by the Amir Ali the Shareef's son, but were as promptly recap tured by tlie forces of Bin Saud with the destruction of the entire forces of All. Bin Saud was ordered by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, to return to Kiyaah at once on pain of having his subsidy stopped. He promptly complied and explained the whole situation in a serious^ of lengthy reports. His ex planation was accepted by His Majesty's Government and matters have been temporarily settled. In the meantime, the trouble between Bin Saud and the Shareef is engaging the careful attention of his Majesty's Government. Un less a modus vivendi acceptable to both parties is found before the Haj season, fighting will break out again. (6) Shaikh |aisal bin Abdul Aziz bin Saud, son of the Ruler of Is T ajd, arri\ ed in Bahrain on August 17th and proceeded to England on August 30th,FOR THE YEAR 1919. 63 as a guest of His Majesty's Government He was accompanied by Major II. E. Bowman. The party arrived in London on 13th October 1919 and were received by His MajestyNtbe King in Buckingham Palace on 30th October 1919. On 26th November 1919, they attended a joint conference of India and ioreign Offices to discuss Arabian affairs. (Note* The party shortly after- Wards returned to Bahrain, reaching Hassa on 12th February 1920). {c) The safety of the Hassa Riyadh trade route was maintained during the year. This being entirely due to the splendid and remarkable work done by the Amir Bin Jaloui, cousin of Shaikh Sir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman as Saud, and ruler of Hassa and Qatif. No praise is too high for the work done by this man and it is hoped His Majesty's Government will see its way to recognise the exceptional qualities of this man by a fitting reward in the near future. (d) The Akhwan. —This movement is increasing rapidly, and in 1919 has made great headway throughout Arabia. It is not the bad move of the Wahabis of a century ago. In nature it is simply a great revival of Religious belief among the ignorant Bedouin It is buing fostered and guided by the Amir of Nejd, Bin Saud, who is far too able and clear-sighted a ruler to allow the movement to deteriorate into a fanatical and anti-European crusade. Bin Saud has the movement absolutely in hand, and may be expected to use it as a political rather than a religious weapon. The many stories and alarmist rumours regarding the movement may be set aside as idle gossip. The Akhwan are the strong backbone, and Pretorian guard, so to speak,lot Bin Saud. They are soldiers rather than priests. The roundheads of a modern Cromwell. (e) Bin Saud recently lodged a formal complaint against Shaikh Isa of Bahrain charging 5 per cent, on goods passing through Bahrain en route for Nejd. He contends such goods should pay no duty to the Shaikh of Bahrain as they are neither consigned to, nor are intended for, Bahrain. The matter has been referred to ^igher authority and is now under consideration. (/) Jurisdiction over subjects of Bin Saud whilst on a visit to, or resident iti, Bahrain —Bin Saud has recently raised the question also. He is very anxious that all his subjects should be considered as under the British Agency's protection whilst in Bahrain. His desire has been strengthened recently, owing to the fact coming to light of several cases of Zulum ' towards his subjects. (g) Opening up of Ojair and Jubail Harbours on the mainland of Hassa as ports to serve Nejd, Qassim and Hassa. Bin Saud has intimated to the Political Agent that he was anxious to take the above work in hand, and officially asked His Majesty's Government that they try and get the British India Steam Navigation Company to run a steamer at once to Ojair, and later on another to Jubail. The above matter has not yet gone beyond the initial stages. It is hoped that the Deputy Political Resident will shortly visit Ojair, Ras Tanurah, and Jubail with the Political Agent, Bahrain, when it will be possible to decide on the merits of each as the future harbour and port of Nejd. YI..— Qatar. —Friendly correspondence on minor matters and giving of news has been kept up with Shaikh Abadullah Bin Jasimath Thani, Shaikh Abadullah was gazetted, C.I.E., on June 3rd, 1919. VII. Customs Bahrain.—(a) Rao Sahib Tirathdas Maharaj, late Director of Customs, Bahrain, headman of the Hindu community in Bahrain and Brahmin community in Karachi, died of diabetes at Karachi. He had greatly assisted the Agency in putting/stop to smuggling of food-stuffs to Tangistan coast duiirg the blockade and was especially thanked by the Deputy Political Resit ent, Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S I, C LE , for good work. Bahrain Customs could ill-afford to lose the services of such valuable and devoted officer and Shaikh Isa still feels his loss. (b) The cash deposit system has worked well during 1919. The object for which it was originally instituted having ceased to exist, a movement headed by Shaikh Isa of Bahrain was started at the end ot 1919 fonts abolition. {Note. In March 1920 the Deputy Political Resident approved of the system being done away with).64 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY. VIII.— Bahrain Trade. —For full report uiider this head see 'Bahrain Trade report ' for 1919. Generally speaking, Bahrain trade was ! satisfactory during 1919. The chief handicap was the lack of shipping and the want of specie to pay for pearls ana divers generally. IX.— Shipping —The upward mails have been calling very regularly but the down mail, i.e., from Basrah and Bushire may be said to have ceased to exist. The very greatest inconvenience and delay ka*. been caused to officials and merchants, not to mention the great loss of trade that has resulted owing to merchants being unable to get away to India. X.— Aerodrome. —Owing to the hopelessly bad state of the mail service from Baghdad and Bushire, application was made to the Civil Commissioner for permission to lay out an aeroplane landing ground in Bahrain. It is hoped that the Civil Commissioner will approve the measure. XI.— Municipal Sanitation. —This shows no improvement, in fact the contrary is ihe case. The Political Agent is working out a simple but fair scheme for taxing the town of Manama on the principles in force in the various tow r ns in Mesopotamia. It is hoped that the scheme will be ready early in 1920 and that Shaikh Isa will be persuaded to sanction its being put into force. XII.— Visits of Ris Majesty's ships during the year— Name of ship.

XVI.— Agency personnel. —Khan Sahib Seyed Siddiq Hasan, Indian Assist^ ant, held charge of the Bahrain Agency for five months during 1919 that is from the date on which Captain Bray, M.C., 'went sick, to 6th November the date on which Major H. R. P. Dickson, C.I E., took over charge. During the period Khan Sahib Siddiq Hasan was in charge, work was carried on efficiently. XVII.— Judicial. —The following number of cases were dealt with during 1919 :— Civil suits, 260. Criminal, 112. The Bahrain Order-in-Council came into force with effect from 3rd Febru* ary 1919, As a result, certain changes in procedure were introduced.TOR THE YEAR 1919, 66 (1) The Joint Courfc, consisting of the Political Agent or bis Indian Assistant/and a representatives of Shaikh Isa the Ruler. This Court now sits in the upper room of the Shaikh's Customs House, Manama. On each Weines- day cases in which one party is a British or protected subject and the other a Bahrain subject, are tried. A large number of cases were satisfactorily settled during 1919 by this Court, in spite of the fact that more often than not the Shaikh's representative (especially Shaikh Abadullah, Shaikh Isa's youngest son) took up the cause of his Father's subject in approved advocate style. (2) The Majlis-al-Urfi, o*- the Court of representative merchants of stand ing, lor purpose of trying Mercantile cases. This Court used to sit in the Agency prior to the enforcement of the Order-in-Council. To-daj it also sits in the Customs House every Wednesday. For many months the Majlis-al- Urfi abstained from sitting owing to Shaikh Isa abusing his privileges and dismissing a member without consulting the Political Agent. As Shaikh Isa refused to adniic himself wrong, the Political Agent in turn refused to allow the Court to meet, vide paragraph II above. The other Courts existing are :— The Salifa Court Judge Mohamed bin Fazil. The Q^zi's Court Shaikii Qasim bin Mehza. The Salifat-al-Bahr (Marine Court) Judge Mubarak bin Hamad. During the year these Courts carried out the work expected of them fairly well. XVIII.— Climate. —Hamfall during 1919 was up to the average. The heat as usual was terribly trying, especially during the months of May, June, July and August. Captain Bray, M.C., the late Politi3al Agent found the heat too much lor him, and probably his illness was aggravated by the fierce weather of May and June. No rain guage or thermometer was kept in the Agency during 1919. It is regretted, therefore, that no figures showing rainfall or temperature can be reported. This fe.ult is being remedied, the necessary instruments have now been ordered. One of the mcst trying features of the Bahrain climate is the damp ness of the atmosphere. In summer this makes a temperature of as low as 95 or 98° almost unbearable. Added to the above, is the extraordinary variation of temperature which changes as much as 25° to 30° within 21 hours. These sudden changes are mostly responssible for Bahrain's bad epidemics of fever. XIV .—Epidemic and During the year under review Assist ant Surgeon G. K. Monani, L. M. &amp; S., has been in charge of Quarantine and town sanitation, in addition to the Medical charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital, U! Strenuous work was done during the influeuzi epidemic, w r hich commenced at about the beginning of November 1918 and ended in January 1920. The epidemic passed over the towns of Majaatna, Muharraq and Hadd, affecting, almost e erv household to a greater or less extent All the members of the Al Khalifah family were affected with the disease including His Excellency Shaikh Isa All of them were treated by Assistant ourgecn (x. K. Monani. His Excellency the Shaikh was affected with Broncho- Pneumonia and his condi- tion was critical and although he got over the lilness with due care, the e convalescence was prolonged and left lum very weak till the advent of spring. The whole epidemic was dealt with single -handed, the Mission Hospital bein-closed. Assistance was asked from Bushire but they could not spare anyone. • t &gt; i • This was also the year for the probable recurrence of plague in Bahrain, which comes on every alternate year. Before the probable season for the appearance of pla-ue every effort was made to get the heaps of rubbish cleared off from the bazaars and streets. A keen watch was kept on die mortality of66 ANNITAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY. iats in houses and godowns cleaned up, and to get them disinfected with So 2 gas whenever any dead rat was picked up from them. Anti -plague inoculation with Professor Haffkine's Plague Prophylactic ^ was carried out. The whole of the detachment and such members of the staff, ] as were willing to be inoculated including Captain and Mrs. Bray, were inocul ated against the disease. Fortunately for every one, the period passed off without any recurrence of the disease. This was the first time since the first appearance of plague in Bahrain in 1903 that the recurrence of the disease, which was usual every second year, did not take place. During the outbreak of small-pox, which is more or less endemic, the whole of the Government Staff was protected against the disease by re-vaccination. H. K. P. .OICKSON, Major C.I.B , Political Agent, Bahrain.FOR THE YEAR 1919. 67 CHAPTER XI. ADMINISTRATION RBPOET OF THE KUWAIT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1919. Folitical and Tribal. —The name Kuwait is the diminutive of Kut and means a small fort:—it sufficiently indi- ntro action. cates the insignificant origin of the thriving town Kuwait, the capital of the principality which now shares its name. In old English records and books, Kuwait is generally called ' Giaine ' or 44 Grane doubtless from the island of Qurain, a short distance to the west of it. The boundaries of Kuwait are as follows :— The line of demarcation starts from the side of the mouths of the Khor ly to the South of Umm Qasr, Safwan and Jebal Sanam in such a manner as to leave the wells of these places in the Vilayet of Basrah ; arrived at the Batin it follows it towards the South- West to Hafar al batin which it leaves on the side of Kuwait; from this point the said line goes to the South East leaving to Kuwait the wells of Es Safa, ElQarah, El Haba, Wabrah, and Anta, and joins the sea near Jebal Manifah. The islands of W T arbah, Bubyan, Mashjnn, EailaTsah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru Maqta and Umm al Maradim with their islands and adjacent waters are comprised in Kuwait territory. A letter was received on 7th February from Shaikh Sir Abdul as Aziz as Sa'ud, objecting to the building of a Qasr at Balbul (near Jebal Manita ) 7 Shaikh Salim on the grounds that the proposed site was m his territory. The matter was referred to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad who has intimated that the question awaits a general settlement with bin fca ud. As more than a petty town shaikhdom, the Sultanate of Kuwait is quite _ mi. y-%-4- &lt;-&gt; I -wk-i-i I 'I •v* fr 1 a Boundaries. Zubair towards the North- West an J passes immediate- modern. The actual ruler, indeed, is only the third either to be gererally styled eldest son, Jabir, who died m *e brother Salim, the present ruler.€8 ANNTAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY. Fopidadon. —The settled population of the Sultanate is estimated at nbout 85,000 of whom about 60,000, are resident in Kuwait town. Of the latter, about 35,000 are Kuwaitis, 15,000 Persians and Bahrainis and 10,(00 Najidis, Bedouins and natW^of Iraq. Tribes. —Two tribes, the Awazim and the Rashaidah, together with a portion of the Muteir, form the bulk of the population outside that of Kuwait town. Small bands of other tribes such as l)hafir, Beni Khalid etc. (who are merely visitors) enter Kuwait territory at certain seasons. Villages. —The principal villages in the district with their approximate populations are :—Jahara, 500; Fantas, 400: Abu lltilaifah, 200: Pahaihil 200: Shi'aibah, 60. Tusf al Dawairi.-~Y\xs\xi n\ Dawairi (mentioned in last year's report),, vilh the concurrence of His Excellency the Shaikh, was given permission in July to return to Kuwait but he'has not yet done so. He is still at Bombay, where it is said he has elected to remain for the present. Blockade. —7.he shipping restrictions as regards exports from India to Kuwait referred to in the report for 1918 were removed at the beginning of the yetr and steamers resumed bringing cargo to Kuwait in February. Aims Traffic. —Reports are still being received from different sources about the smuggling of arms and ammunition from Kuwait into Tangistan and other smaller ports on the Persian Coast. In October it was reported from Eabrain that a Kuwait boom, Nakhuda •Ahmed, al Ghadairi, arrived there on 21st September with a Kuwaiti*. Abadullah' Ali al Sharidah, having 40 rifles and 1,200 cartridges hidden in his bedding and attempting to smuggle them at night but detected by the Customs special watchman. The arms were seized and confiscated by the ^Shaikh of Bahrain, and the man and the Nakhuda were let off without further enquiry or punishment. Enquiries made here went to show that neither 'Abdullah bin 'Ali al Sharidah went from Kuwait by Nakhuda Ahmed al Ghadari's boom nor was lie a Kuwait subject. It appears that on the night they w r ere seized the arms- were brought on board the Kuwait boom at Pah rain from shore in a jolly boat tor shipment to some unknown destination. The case is still under enquiry. Tearl fishery. —Tie pearl season was a veiy successful om 1 . Although the m hole Kuwait pearling fleet did not participate^ in the fishery for want of crevs, the take was above the average and prices ruled ve?y high—much higher than those of the lest 5 or 6 years. evenu ^—The Shaikh's principal sources of revenues are :— 1. Customs. 2. Pearl-fisheiy. S Private property (principally date gardens at Fao). The Customs bring him about Rs. 7,50,000 per annum, while his date gardens at Fao yield him rboufc Rs 7,00 000. He gets a d/iver's share in each Kuwait peailing boat. Irrigation —The land around Kuwait is rich and admirably suited to iriigation but is de^ei d' nt on wells, of v&gt; hich there are not many, as a source ot' supply. Irrigation is therefore confined to a few centres wheie water is found; Jtgi Ifulture. —The area w der cultivation is {-mall due to the scarcity of water. The principal cultivation centres are Jahra, Hawallii and a few viilages al.org the Qasur coast. Wheat and barley arc sown in the open desert in the rainy season and under favourable condiiions as much as 60 tons is got? in this way. Small quantities of vegetables are brought into Kuwait town from the surrounding: villages but the town is principally dependent on the- S Mtfc-al-Arab gardens for its green stuffs. Judicial. —Justice is administered by the Shaikh, in- the most arbitrary way, and his word is law. The Political Agent is not vested with judicial powers, and cases of British subjects are therefore settled by him informally, and those between British subjects and Arabs are referred to the Shaikh for equitable settlement.FOR THE TEAR 1919. 69 There has been very little serious crime in the town during the year. Education. -yExcept for the Day and Night School conducted by the Eev. Mr. Caheriy of the American Mission, there are no educaHonal facilities outside those offered in the Koranic schools which here, as in other places only /each a sufficiency ot Arabic to enable the pupils to read the Koran. ^ Medical and Sanitation.—As the Assistant Surgeon's post has been vacant the^Agency Charitable dispensary remained closed throughout the vear uruW review, J No sanitary arrangements exist in Kuwait, and there is no idea of syste matic conservancy. ^ Those who live near the sea-share, use it for the purpose 01 nature, the inhabitants of the outskirts use the open desert and those of the central quarters their house tops, or pits dug on the road-side or, in the less frequented quarters, the road side itself. Here refuse matter is allowed to accumulate. . There are no scavengers bat the principal streets are generally fairly clean, 4)eing swept by the breeze which blows intermittingly almost throughout tbo year. 3 Police, ihe Shaikh does not keep special men for police work but uses hia retainers for this purpose whenever required. In addition to these there are about 60 night guards, mostly Beloochies from the Mekran Coast, for watching the shops at night. 0 Labour —Is expensive in Kuwait. The following are the present rates of 4aily wages for the different handicraft : — Rs. Head Mason Assistant Mason Labourer Master carpenter As istant carpenter Nail driver . Coolia 10 with food. ^ » it 4 ^ If 10 „ „ 8 „ 6 ;» » 3 ,, Thealjove rates were 50 to 75 per cent, lower before the war. Honours Z^.—Four honours were conferred during the year as follows :—• New Year's Honours' List . . C. S. I. to His Excellency Shaikh Saiim Birthday Honours' List . . . O. B. E. to Dr. C. S. G.

Kuwait Mission to England. —In August 1919 Bis Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait was invited to send his nephew, Shaikh Ahmad bin Jabir, to London as a guest of His Majesty's Government. Though he wrote a cordial reply accepting the invitation it is understood he was very perturbed at the choice of Shaikh Ahmad. If the selection bad been left to himself he would most probably have decided in favour of his own son, 'Abdullah, whom be has for a long time been trying to bring into prominence with a view to the succession, but who would make about as unsatisfactory a ruler as Shaikh Saiim himself is. It is well, therefore, that he was left without a choice Shaikh Ahmad, with a suite of three, left for England on August 28th and arrived there on October 13th. Major Bowman, Director of Education in 'Iraq, was in charge of the party until its arrival in England when Mr. Philby relieved him. On October 27th, Captain McCollum, who had been on leave in England, was given charge and Shaikh Ahmad was by him presented t© Their Majesties the King and Queen and Her Royal Highness Princess Mary at Buckingham Palace on October 30th. The Shaikh read an address to the King thanking him for the great honour bestowed on him by the reception,70 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY offering the hearty congratulations of Kuwait on the success of the war and praying for a continuance of the favours leceived from His Majesty's Govern ment, and then presented a gold sword and dagger from Shaikh Salina and requested acceptance of an Arab stallion as a personal gift from himself. His Majesty replied in suitable terms and then presented him with an autographed silyer-framed photograph. The Shaikh was delighted with his reception at the Palace and especially with the kind words of His Majesty. Ihe Mission sailed from Glasgow on November 8th, after having visited many places of interest in England and Scotland. A seven days' tour of Egypt was made on the way out. The party arrived back in Kuwait on December 15th with Captain McCollum. Politically, the Mission was a very great success. Shaikh Ahmad, who is the heir apparent, has learned much in his travels and evinces a keen desire to travel further in the future. He talks of the backwardness of Kuwait with regret and blames his uncle, the present ruler,^for its unprogress!veness. His ideas have been very much broadened and generally he promises well for the future. Water plant. —The water plant started work on 17th March. On 18th, water was given free but only about 4,800 gallons were taken. The plant had to be shut down again as there were no buyers for the water. The Shaikh and the people alleged that the w r ater was brackish. Mr. Walpole, General Manager, Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, arrived on 31st March but as he cou d not arrive at a satisfactory arrangement with the Shaikh he withdrew his staff from the plant and left for Mohammerah with Mr. Herring, the Engineer in charge, on 3rd April. In May, the Shaik empowered the Political Agent to settle the dispute, and the latter accordingly went to Mohammerah and concluded a new agreement on behalf of the Shaikh for the working of the plant and thus ended the differences between the Shaikh and Messrs. Strick Scott and Company. But when the plant actually started continuous work on 4th, the water turned out was distinctly brackish (due to a leak which was discovered some days later and then put right) and moreover it failed to turn out 250 tons water in 13 hours, as required by the new agreement. The Shaik. therefore refused to take it over unless and until the contractors had shown nim by trial tests that it could producj the stipulated quantity of 260 tons in 12 hours or 400 tons in 24 hours of good water according to the original contract. This the contractors are unable to do until perhaps they make extensive alterations and additions in the water plant, as suggested by the testing Engineer. Naval and Marine. —The following Naval and H. I. M. S. ships called a Kuwait during the year :— 11. L M.S. 'Hardinge' 20th February, R. I. M. S. 'Nearchus ,, 26th March, H. M. S.

One of these patients was the little sou of Shaikh Jabir bin Mubarak who very nearly succumbed to pneumonia but, we are glad to say, eventually made a complete recovery.
