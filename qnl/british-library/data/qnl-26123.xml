Summer set, Lymington 10th August, 1933 Dear Laithwaite, In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that/ will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- 9• Local Bodies. These are the Aden Port Trust (constituted under a Crovernment of Bombay Act of 1888) and the Aden Settlement, which deals with municipal matters under the its own revenue and expenditure, and in my opinion they should continue their separate existence as at present, and should not be merged into the new local administration. control of the Chief Commissioner.

The Port of Aden which affords safe accommodation for vessels upto 33 feet in draught, is administered by a Board of Trustees constituted under the Aden Port Trust Act V of 1888. The Board is at present composed of four officials, including the Chairman, who is an officer of the Bombay Public Works Department and is also Chairman of the Aden Settlement and seven non- officials. The Trustees are appointed by Government for a period of 2 years. Vacancies during this period are filled by the Resident. The work of deepening and extending the Harbour and Approach Channel which was commenced on the 27th December 1928 w as completed on the 24tl’ December 1930 at a cost of Rs. 35,57,986. The minimum depth of water at low tide now available in the Approach Channel and Inner Mooring Basin except the 4 deep w r ater berths, is 32' 6' ; there are four oil berths connected to the land installation by submarine pipe lines, tw o of which berths have been dredged to a minimum depth of 35 feet at L. W. ; there are tw r o other berths dredged to a similar depth available for the supply of bunker coal and for general purposes. The Port Trust maintain a Pilot service consisting of one Harbour Master and five pilots. The Aden Port Trust publish a separate administration report. Mercantile Marine matters in Aden are now the concern of the Government of India who administer them through the Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department, Aden District. This officer is appointed from the Royal Indian Marine, and is also the Superintendent of Lighthouses for the district of Aden. XVI.— Shipping. Thenumber of vessels that entered the port of Aden during 1931-32 was 1,587 with an aggregate tonnage of 6,019,463 as compared with 1,664 vessels aggregating 5,999,242 tons in the previous year. Appendix XXV shows the number of vessels that called at the port during the last ten years for (1) cargo and (2) for bunkers only. It will be seen that there has been an increase under (1) from 687 vessels in 1922-23 to 1,109 vessels in 1931-32 and under (2) from 199 in 1922-23 to 272 in 1931-32. During recent years Aden has developed rapidly as an oil bunkering port This is due mainly to its favourable geographical position, as ic is nearer to the Persian oil fields than any other port on the main shipping route between Europe and the East; and also to the policy of the Aden Port Trust, which has aimed at giving ample facilities for oil fueling, wnile keeping the charges on this business as low as possible. 298 steamers entered the Port of Perim during the year of which 214 called for coal and fuel oil and 84 for vaxinmi ntEpr^mirnnsPs.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000009_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1473</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000009</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1473</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/37 'Aden.
