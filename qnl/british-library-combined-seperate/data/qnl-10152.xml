The file therefore contains exchanges between British officials on the sort of penalties that should be enforced. Another related subject is the extent that the subjects of the Gulf states — in special treaty relations with Britain — are considered to be British Protected Persons at courts in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Muscat respectively; the answer to this question is summarised as part of an office notice on folio 98. Also discussed is the extent of the Kuwait Political Agent's authority to solemnise Christian marriages in Kuwait (see folios 101-8) under the Order in Council.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: the Kuwait Political Agent (Harold Richard Dickson and Gerald Simpson de Gaury); the Persian Gulf Political Resident (Trenchard Craven William Fowle); the Foreign Department of the Government of India; and officials of the India Office and the Foreign Office.The Arabic language content consists of a few brief letters exchanged between the Kuwait Political Resident and either the Shaikh of Kuwait or the Deputy Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah [Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ] and Shaikh `Abdulla as-Salim as-Sabah respectively. It concerns the transmission of copies of new regulations and notifications of when they will come into force.A copy of the
                           Kuwait Air Navigation Regulation(1936) can be found on folio 85, while a draft copy titled
                           Breach of Air Navigation Regulationdated 1935 can be found on folios 46-47; a list of regulations issued under the Kuwait Order in Council can be found on folio 90. A draft of the equivalent Muscat regulations can be found on folio 68.The creation date range reflects the inclusion of enclosures of an earlier date than their respective covering letters. The main run of correspondence commences from 29 April 1935.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Kuwait Order in Council</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indian Christian Marriage Act (1872)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00014a#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00014a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00014a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
