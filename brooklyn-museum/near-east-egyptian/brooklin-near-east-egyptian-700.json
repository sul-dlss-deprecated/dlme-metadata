On one side is a head of Nerfertiti, in sunk relief, wearing a high crown. There is no uraeus. The workmanship is good and the piece is typical of its period. On the back side are three figures, to the left is a feather sign, in the center is the trace of a skirt and a right foot, the latter unfinished. At the extreme right is the hieroglyph for \u201cT\u201d. \r\nCondition: The face of the head of the queen is in practically perfect condition. The head is cut off about halfway up the crown which is apparently as it was originally made. The back of the piece is considerably chipped, a part of the feather sign and shirt are missing. The fracture suggests the sculptor deliberately eradicated these details.", "medium": "Limestone", "dimensions": "4 \u00d7 2 3/16 \u00d7 9 in.
