We note that the Government of Pakistan state that there is no connection between the deputation allowance and the local compensatory allowance and we agree that Major Tandy may receive:- (1) Cost of living allowance at Rs.263 P»ni. from 15th August to 31st December 1947 and at Rs. 150 thereafter (he finally left Koweit on April 15 th 1948). (2) Local compensatory allowance of Rs. 150 p.m. (3) Deputation allowance of Rs. 375 P-ni. Yours sincerely F.A.K.

Government of Pakistan EXPRESS LETTER. To Dated the * June 1948. Your express letter No. Ext.912/4SL»- dated the 7th April 1948 f Deputation of Major M.P.O’C Tandy. and the Persian Gulf ar«ia, a local compensatory allowance was granted to the Officers serving there in addition to the ordinary cost of living allowance; and Rs.150/- p.m. was the rate of this local compen satory allowance admissible to Major Tandy. This local compensatory allowance has no# connection with the deputation allowance of Rs.T'75/- p.m. which is the usual deputation allowance of Rs.25$ of pay granted to officers on foreign service. As there is no change in the cost of living in Persia and the Persian Gulf area, the Government of Pakistan consider that Major Tandy should draw the local compensatory allowance of Rs.150/- p.m. in addition to the ordinary cost of living allowance and the reputation allowance of Rs.S75/- p.m. 3. The Government of Pakistan have since revised the rates of cost of living allowance with effect from the 1st January 1948, as detailed in their Office Memorandum No.F.9(2)-Eg.11/48 dated the 29th January 1948 (copy enclosed). Major Tandy is therefore eligible for the following allowances, in addition to his other emoluments, while on deputation in Kuwait:- (i) Cost of living allowance at Rs.263/- p.m. upto 31st December 1947 and at Rs.150/- p.m. from 1st January. ljD48. (ii) Local compensatory allowance at Rs.150/- p.m. (iii) Deputation allowance of Rs.275/- p.m. The issue of the above has been authorised.

Tandy was previously drawing war allowance at Rs. 263 and local compensatory allowance Re. 150 - a total of Rs. 413 as against his present deputation allowance Rs.375 - so that he is worse off by Rs. 38/- as he states in his letter.

Were Tandy now serving under the Pakistan Government he would be drawing the dearness allowance of Bs. 150/- p.m. (oh the assumption that the Govern ment of India*s revised rates of dearness allowance have been applied to Government servants in Pakistan) and I consider it only fair therefore that this should be added to the emoluments listed in the telegram under reference.
