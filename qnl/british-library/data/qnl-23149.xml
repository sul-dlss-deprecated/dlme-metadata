The arrangements for the police posts in Manameh and huharraq do not appear satisfactory. The police are the local inhabitants. I would suggest that orders be issued to the head of the police through the Adiainistrative Coura and an te the effect that the 75 policemen necessary for 24 hours reliefs on a given post be permanently on that post and be required to Imow all the inhabitants in the vicinity of their beat and to report to the head of the police arrival of constantly beinr changed from one post to another and being mostly foreigners they have no opportunity of getting to know outsiders or anything of suspicious nature.

Cases have recently occurred in which prisoners in the tate Jail require daily nedical treatment and to facilitate this we have accented transfer of such prisoners in the Agency lock up. ' \ * This systen is inconvenient for various reasons. (1) re have very limited acc^odation at the Agency and the press: nresenoe of sick men in the cell is very undesirable. ( 2 ) we cannot } under any circunstances^ accept subjects of the Bahrein State in the Agency lock up and the superintendent otate Prison has no means of knowing whether prisoners sentenced in i Joint court Cases are Bahrain State prisoners or Foreigners under British Protection. I would suggest that you discuss with the Medical Officer what arrangements can best be made i or treatment of such cases in future. r n this connection I would mention that donkeys with carts were originally sanctioned for the bevy Corps among other things, to take to hospital levy men, police or prisoners unable. to walk. It is however, conceivable that in certain cases even ' t the ride in a cart is inadvisable. In case of severe sickness the prisoner should he admitted to hospital and a guard provided. To facilitate guarcl- -inr such men possibly a special ward for sick prisoners. capaM of being lo.ked up, could he built in the hospital. Any how it seems desirable to make some permanent arrangement to meet thes&lt; cases. P.T.CNo %0ln Of 1925 W.
